<p/>WUTHERING HEIGHTS


<p/>CHAPTER I


<p/>1801.--I have just returned from a visit to my landlord--the solitary
neighbour that I shall be troubled with. This is certainly a beautiful
country! In all England, I do not believe that I could have fixed on a
situation so completely removed from the stir of society. A perfect
misanthropist's heaven: and Mr. Heathcliff and I are such a suitable pair
to divide the desolation between us. A capital fellow! He (<font color='blue'><b>fellow</b></font>) little
imagined how my heart warmed towards him (<font color='blue'><b>fellow</b></font>) when I beheld his (<font color='blue'><b>fellow</b></font>) black eyes
withdraw so suspiciously under their brows, as I rode up, and when his (<font color='blue'><b>fellow</b></font>)
fingers sheltered themselves, with a jealous resolution, still further in
his (<font color='blue'><b>fellow</b></font>) waistcoat, as I announced my name.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Mr. Heathcliff?''  (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div>I said.

<p/>A nod was the answer.

<p/>``Mr. Lockwood, your new tenant, sir. I do myself the honour of calling
as soon as possible after my arrival, to express the hope that I have not
inconvenienced you by my perseverance in soliciting the occupation of
Thrushcross Grange: I heard yesterday you had had some thoughts--'

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Thrushcross Grange is my own, sir,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>fellow</b></font>) interrupted, wincing. <div class="bookquote">``I should
not allow any one to inconvenience me, if I could hinder it--walk in!''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/>The `walk in' was uttered with closed teeth, and expressed the sentiment,
``Go to the Deuce:' even the gate over which he (<font color='blue'><b>Lockwood</b></font>) leant manifested no
sympathising movement to the words; and I think that circumstance
determined me to accept the invitation: I felt interested in a man who
seemed more exaggeratedly reserved than myself.

<p/>When he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) saw my horse's breast fairly pushing the barrier, he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) did put out
his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) hand to unchain it, and then sullenly preceded me up the causeway,
calling, as we entered the court,--<div class="bookquote">``Joseph, take Mr. Lockwood's horse;
and bring up some wine.''

 (<font color='red'><b>me</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Here we have the whole establishment of domestics, I suppose,''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>was the
reflection suggested by this compound order. <div class="bookquote">``No wonder the grass grows
up between the flags, and cattle are the only hedge-cutters.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Joseph</b></font>)</div><p/>Joseph was an elderly, nay, an old man: very old, perhaps, though hale
and sinewy. <div class="bookquote">``The Lord help us!''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Joseph</b></font>) soliloquised in an undertone of
peevish displeasure, while relieving me of my horse: looking, meantime,
in my face so sourly that I charitably conjectured he (<font color='blue'><b>Joseph</b></font>) must have need of
divine aid to digest his (<font color='blue'><b>Joseph</b></font>) dinner, and his (<font color='blue'><b>Joseph</b></font>) pious ejaculation had no
reference to my unexpected advent.

<p/>Wuthering Heights is the name of Mr. Heathcliff's dwelling. ``Wuthering'
being a significant provincial adjective, descriptive of the atmospheric
tumult to which its station is exposed in stormy weather. Pure, bracing
ventilation they must have up there at all times, indeed: one may guess
the power of the north wind blowing over the edge, by the excessive slant
of a few stunted firs at the end of the house; and by a range of gaunt
thorns all stretching their limbs one way, as if craving alms of the sun.
Happily, the architect had foresight to build it strong: the narrow
windows are deeply set in the wall, and the corners defended with large
jutting stones.

<p/>Before passing the threshold, I paused to admire a quantity of grotesque
carving lavished over the front, and especially about the principal door;
above which, among a wilderness of crumbling griffins and shameless
little boys, I detected the date <div class="bookquote">``1500,''  (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div>and the name <div class="bookquote">``Hareton Earnshaw.''
 (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div>I would have made a few comments, and requested a short history of the
place from the surly owner; but his (<font color='blue'><b>owner</b></font>) attitude at the door appeared to
demand my speedy entrance, or complete departure, and I had no desire to
aggravate his (<font color='blue'><b>owner</b></font>) impatience previous to inspecting the penetralium.

<p/>One stop brought us into the family sitting-room, without any
introductory lobby or passage: they call it here `the house'
pre-eminently. It includes kitchen and parlour, generally; but I believe
at Wuthering Heights the kitchen is forced to retreat altogether into
another quarter: at least I distinguished a chatter of tongues, and a
clatter of culinary utensils, deep within; and I observed no signs of
roasting, boiling, or baking, about the huge fireplace; nor any glitter
of copper saucepans and tin cullenders on the walls. One end, indeed,
reflected splendidly both light and heat from ranks of immense pewter
dishes, interspersed with silver jugs and tankards, towering row after
row, on a vast oak dresser, to the very roof. The latter had never been
under-drawn: its entire anatomy lay bare to an inquiring eye, except
where a frame of wood laden with oatcakes and clusters of legs of beef,
mutton, and ham, concealed it. Above the chimney were sundry villainous
old guns, and a couple of horse-pistols: and, by way of ornament, three
gaudily-painted canisters disposed along its ledge. The floor was of
smooth, white stone; the chairs, high-backed, primitive structures,
painted green: one or two heavy black ones lurking in the shade. In an
arch under the dresser reposed a huge, liver-coloured bitch pointer,
surrounded by a swarm of squealing puppies; and other dogs haunted other
recesses.

<p/>The apartment and furniture would have been nothing extraordinary as
belonging to a homely, northern farmer, with a stubborn countenance, and
stalwart limbs set out to advantage in knee-breeches and gaiters. Such
an individual seated in his (<font color='blue'><b>stalwart</b></font>) arm-chair, his (<font color='blue'><b>stalwart</b></font>) mug of ale frothing on the
round table before him (<font color='blue'><b>stalwart</b></font>), is to be seen in any circuit of five or six miles
among these hills, if you go at the right time after dinner. But Mr.
Heathcliff forms a singular contrast to his (<font color='blue'><b>Heathcliff</b></font>) abode and style of living. He (<font color='blue'><b>Heathcliff</b></font>)
is a dark-skinned gipsy in aspect, in dress and manners a gentleman: that
is, as much a gentleman as many a country squire: rather slovenly,
perhaps, yet not looking amiss with his (<font color='blue'><b>squire</b></font>) negligence, because he (<font color='blue'><b>squire</b></font>) has an
erect and handsome figure; and rather morose. Possibly, some people
might suspect him (<font color='blue'><b>squire</b></font>) of a degree of under-bred pride; I have a sympathetic
chord within that tells me it is nothing of the sort: I know, by
instinct, his (<font color='blue'><b>squire</b></font>) reserve springs from an aversion to showy displays of
feeling--to manifestations of mutual kindliness. He (<font color='blue'><b>squire</b></font>)'ll love and hate
equally under cover, and esteem it a species of impertinence to be loved
or hated again. No, I'm running on too fast: I bestow my own attributes
over-liberally on him (<font color='blue'><b>squire</b></font>). Mr. Heathcliff may have entirely dissimilar
reasons for keeping his (<font color='blue'><b>Heathcliff</b></font>) hand out of the way when he (<font color='blue'><b>Heathcliff</b></font>) meets a would-be
acquaintance, to those which actuate me. Let me hope my constitution is
almost peculiar: my dear mother used to say I should never have a
comfortable home; and only last summer I proved myself perfectly unworthy
of one.

<p/>While enjoying a month of fine weather at the sea-coast, I was thrown
into the company of a most fascinating creature: a real goddess in my
eyes, as long as she (<font color='blue'><b>goddess</b></font>) took no notice of me. I `never told my love'
vocally; still, if looks have language, the merest idiot might have
guessed I was over head and ears: she (<font color='blue'><b>goddess</b></font>) understood me at last, and looked a
return--the sweetest of all imaginable looks. And what did I do? I
confess it with shame--shrunk icily into myself, like a snail; at every
glance retired colder and farther; till finally the poor innocent was led
to doubt her (<font color='blue'><b>goddess</b></font>) own senses, and, overwhelmed with confusion at her (<font color='blue'><b>goddess</b></font>) supposed
mistake, persuaded her (<font color='blue'><b>goddess</b></font>) mamma to decamp. By this curious turn of
disposition I have gained the reputation of deliberate heartlessness; how
undeserved, I alone can appreciate.

<p/>I took a seat at the end of the hearthstone opposite that towards which
my landlord advanced, and filled up an interval of silence by attempting
to caress the canine mother, who had left her (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) nursery, and was sneaking
wolfishly to the back of my legs, her (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) lip curled up, and her (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) white teeth
watering for a snatch. My caress provoked a long, guttural gnarl.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``You'd better let the dog alone,''  (<font color='red'><b>Heathcliff/Mr. Heathcliff</b></font>)</div>growled Mr. Heathcliff in unison,
checking fiercer demonstrations with a punch of his (<font color='blue'><b>Heathcliff</b></font>) foot. <div class="bookquote">``She (<font color='blue'><b>architect</b></font>)'s not
accustomed to be spoiled--not kept for a pet.''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>Then, striding to a side
door, he (<font color='blue'><b>Heathcliff</b></font>) shouted again, <div class="bookquote">``Joseph!''

 (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div><p/>Joseph mumbled indistinctly in the depths of the cellar, but gave no
intimation of ascending; so his (<font color='blue'><b>Joseph</b></font>) master dived down to him (<font color='blue'><b>Joseph</b></font>), leaving me
_vis-a-vis_ the ruffianly bitch and a pair of grim shaggy sheep-dogs,
who shared with her (<font color='blue'><b>bitch</b></font>) a jealous guardianship over all my movements. Not
anxious to come in contact with their fangs, I sat still; but, imagining
they would scarcely understand tacit insults, I unfortunately indulged
in winking and making faces at the trio, and some turn of my physiognomy
so irritated madam, that she (<font color='blue'><b>madam</b></font>) suddenly broke into a fury and leapt on my
knees. I flung her (<font color='blue'><b>madam</b></font>) back, and hastened to interpose the table between us.
This proceeding aroused the whole hive: half-a-dozen four-footed fiends,
of various sizes and ages, issued from hidden dens to the common centre.
I felt my heels and coat-laps peculiar subjects of assault; and parrying
off the larger combatants as effectually as I could with the poker, I
was constrained to demand, aloud, assistance from some of the household
in re-establishing peace.

<p/>Mr. Heathcliff and his (<font color='blue'><b>Heathcliff</b></font>) man climbed the cellar steps with vexatious
phlegm: I don't think they moved one second faster than usual, though
the hearth was an absolute tempest of worrying and yelping. Happily, an
inhabitant of the kitchen made more despatch: a lusty dame, with
tucked-up gown, bare arms, and fire-flushed cheeks, rushed into the
midst of us flourishing a frying-pan: and used that weapon, and her (<font color='blue'><b>Heathcliff</b></font>)
tongue, to such purpose, that the storm subsided magically, and she (<font color='blue'><b>Heathcliff</b></font>) only
remained, heaving like a sea after a high wind, when her (<font color='blue'><b>Heathcliff</b></font>) master entered
on the scene.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``What the devil is the matter?''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>master</b></font>) asked, eyeing me in a manner that I
could ill endure, after this inhospitable treatment.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``What the devil, indeed!''  (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div>I muttered. <div class="bookquote">``The herd of possessed swine could
have had no worse spirits in them than those animals of yours, sir. You
might as well leave a stranger with a brood of tigers!''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``They won't meddle with persons who touch nothing,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>master</b></font>) remarked, putting
the bottle before me, and restoring the displaced table. <div class="bookquote">``The dogs do
right to be vigilant. Take a glass of wine?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``No, thank you.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Not bitten, are you?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``If I had been, I would have set my signet on the biter.''  (<font color='red'><b>Heathcliff/Mr. Heathcliff</b></font>)</div>Heathcliff's
countenance relaxed into a grin.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Come, come,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Heathcliff</b></font>) said, `you are flurried, Mr. Lockwood. Here, take a
little wine. Guests are so exceedingly rare in this house that I and my
dogs, I am willing to own, hardly know how to receive them. Your health,
sir?''

<p/>I bowed and returned the pledge; beginning to perceive that it would be
foolish to sit sulking for the misbehaviour of a pack of curs; besides, I
felt loth to yield the fellow further amusement at my expense; since his (<font color='blue'><b>fellow</b></font>)
humour took that turn. He (<font color='blue'><b>fellow</b></font>)--probably swayed by prudential consideration
of the folly of offending a good tenant--relaxed a little in the laconic
style of chipping off his (<font color='blue'><b>fellow</b></font>) pronouns and auxiliary verbs, and introduced
what he (<font color='blue'><b>fellow</b></font>) supposed would be a subject of interest to me,--a discourse on
the advantages and disadvantages of my present place of retirement. I
found him (<font color='blue'><b>fellow</b></font>) very intelligent on the topics we touched; and before I went
home, I was encouraged so far as to volunteer another visit to-morrow. He (<font color='blue'><b>fellow</b></font>)
evidently wished no repetition of my intrusion. I shall go,
notwithstanding. It is astonishing how sociable I feel myself compared
with him (<font color='blue'><b>fellow</b></font>).




<p/>CHAPTER II


<p/>Yesterday afternoon set in misty and cold. I had half a mind to spend it
by my study fire, instead of wading through heath and mud to Wuthering
Heights. On coming up from dinner, however, -LRB-N.B.--I dine between twelve
and one o'clock; the housekeeper, a matronly lady, taken as a fixture
along with the house, could not, or would not, comprehend my request that
I might be served at five-RRB---on mounting the stairs with this lazy
intention, and stepping into the room, I saw a servant-girl on her (<font color='blue'><b>housekeeper</b></font>) knees
surrounded by brushes and coal-scuttles, and raising an infernal dust as
she (<font color='blue'><b>housekeeper</b></font>) extinguished the flames with heaps of cinders. This spectacle drove
me back immediately; I took my hat, and, after a four-miles' walk,
arrived at Heathcliff's garden-gate just in time to escape the first
feathery flakes of a snow-shower.

<p/>On that bleak hill-top the earth was hard with a black frost, and the air
made me shiver through every limb. Being unable to remove the chain, I
jumped over, and, running up the flagged causeway bordered with
straggling gooseberry-bushes, knocked vainly for admittance, till my
knuckles tingled and the dogs howled.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Wretched inmates!''  (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div>I ejaculated, mentally, `you deserve perpetual
isolation from your species for your churlish inhospitality. At least, I
would not keep my doors barred in the day-time. I don't care--I will get
in!'' So resolved, I grasped the latch and shook it vehemently.
Vinegar-faced Joseph projected his (<font color='blue'><b>Joseph</b></font>) head from a round window of the barn.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``What are ye for?''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Joseph</b></font>) shouted. <div class="bookquote">``T' maister's down i' t' fowld. Go round
by th' end o' t' laith, if ye went to spake to him (<font color='blue'><b>you</b></font>).''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Is there nobody inside to open the door?''  (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div>I hallooed, responsively.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``There's nobbut t' missis; and shoo'll not oppen 't an ye mak' yer
flaysome dins till neeght.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Why? Cannot you tell her (<font color='blue'><b>ye</b></font>) whom I am, eh, Joseph?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/>``Nor-ne me! I'll hae no hend wi<div class="bookquote">``t,''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>muttered the head, vanishing.

<p/>The snow began to drive thickly. I seized the handle to essay another
trial; when a young man without coat, and shouldering a pitchfork,
appeared in the yard behind. He (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) hailed me to follow him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>), and, after
marching through a wash-house, and a paved area containing a coal-shed,
pump, and pigeon-cot, we at length arrived in the huge, warm, cheerful
apartment where I was formerly received. It glowed delightfully in the
radiance of an immense fire, compounded of coal, peat, and wood; and near
the table, laid for a plentiful evening meal, I was pleased to observe
the <div class="bookquote">``missis,''  (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div>an individual whose existence I had never previously
suspected. I bowed and waited, thinking she (<font color='blue'><b>I</b></font>) would bid me take a seat.
She (<font color='blue'><b>I</b></font>) looked at me, leaning back in her (<font color='blue'><b>I</b></font>) chair, and remained motionless and
mute.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Rough weather!''  (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div>I remarked. <div class="bookquote">``I'm afraid, Mrs. Heathcliff, the door must
bear the consequence of your servants' leisure attendance: I had hard
work to make them hear me.''

 (<font color='red'><b>She</b></font>)</div><p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>I</b></font>) never opened her (<font color='blue'><b>I</b></font>) mouth. I stared--she (<font color='blue'><b>I</b></font>) stared also: at any rate, she (<font color='blue'><b>I</b></font>)
kept her (<font color='blue'><b>I</b></font>) eyes on me in a cool, regardless manner, exceedingly
embarrassing and disagreeable.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Sit down,''  (<font color='red'><b>the man</b></font>)</div>said the young man, gruffly. <div class="bookquote">``He (<font color='blue'><b>Joseph</b></font>)'ll be in soon.''

 (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div><p/>I obeyed; and hemmed, and called the villain Juno, who deigned, at this
second interview, to move the extreme tip of her (<font color='blue'><b>I</b></font>) tail, in token of owning
my acquaintance.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``A beautiful animal!''  (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div>I commenced again. <div class="bookquote">``Do you intend parting with the
little ones, madam?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``They are not mine,''  (<font color='red'><b>the hostess</b></font>)</div>said the amiable hostess, more repellingly than
Heathcliff himself could have replied.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Ah, your favourites are among these?''  (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div>I continued, turning to an obscure
cushion full of something like cats.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``A strange choice of favourites!''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>hostess</b></font>) observed scornfully.

<p/>Unluckily, it was a heap of dead rabbits. I hemmed once more, and drew
closer to the hearth, repeating my comment on the wildness of the
evening.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``You should not have come out,''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>hostess</b></font>) said, rising and reaching from the
chimney-piece two of the painted canisters.

<p/>Her (<font color='blue'><b>hostess</b></font>) position before was sheltered from the light; now, I had a distinct
view of her (<font color='blue'><b>hostess</b></font>) whole figure and countenance. She (<font color='blue'><b>hostess</b></font>) was slender, and
apparently scarcely past girlhood: an admirable form, and the most
exquisite little face that I have ever had the pleasure of beholding;
small features, very fair; flaxen ringlets, or rather golden, hanging
loose on her (<font color='blue'><b>hostess</b></font>) delicate neck; and eyes, had they been agreeable in
expression, that would have been irresistible: fortunately for my
susceptible heart, the only sentiment they evinced hovered between scorn
and a kind of desperation, singularly unnatural to be detected there. The
canisters were almost out of her (<font color='blue'><b>hostess</b></font>) reach; I made a motion to aid her (<font color='blue'><b>hostess</b></font>); she (<font color='blue'><b>hostess</b></font>)
turned upon me as a miser might turn if any one attempted to assist him (<font color='blue'><b>miser</b></font>)
in counting his (<font color='blue'><b>miser</b></font>) gold.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``I don't want your help,''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>hostess</b></font>) snapped; <div class="bookquote">``I can get them for myself.''

 (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I beg your pardon!''  (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div>I hastened to reply.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Were you asked to tea?''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>hostess</b></font>) demanded, tying an apron over her (<font color='blue'><b>hostess</b></font>) neat black
frock, and standing with a spoonful of the leaf poised over the pot.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``I shall be glad to have a cup,''  (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div>I answered.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Were you asked?''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>hostess</b></font>) repeated.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``No,''  (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div>I said, half smiling. <div class="bookquote">``You are the proper person to ask me.''

 (<font color='red'><b>She</b></font>)</div><p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>hostess</b></font>) flung the tea back, spoon and all, and resumed her (<font color='blue'><b>hostess</b></font>) chair in a pet;
her (<font color='blue'><b>hostess</b></font>) forehead corrugated, and her (<font color='blue'><b>hostess</b></font>) red under-lip pushed out, like a child's
ready to cry.

<p/>Meanwhile, the young man had slung on to his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) person a decidedly shabby
upper garment, and, erecting himself before the blaze, looked down on me
from the corner of his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) eyes, for all the world as if there were some
mortal feud unavenged between us. I began to doubt whether he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) were a
servant or not: his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) dress and speech were both rude, entirely devoid of
the superiority observable in Mr. and Mrs. Heathcliff; his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) thick brown
curls were rough and uncultivated, his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) whiskers encroached bearishly over
his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) cheeks, and his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) hands were embrowned like those of a common labourer:
still his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) bearing was free, almost haughty, and he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) showed none of a
domestic's assiduity in attending on the lady of the house. In the
absence of clear proofs of his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) condition, I deemed it best to abstain
from noticing his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) curious conduct; and, five minutes afterwards, the
entrance of Heathcliff relieved me, in some measure, from my
uncomfortable state.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``You see, sir, I am come, according to promise!''  (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div>I exclaimed, assuming
the cheerful; `and I fear I shall be weather-bound for half an hour, if
you can afford me shelter during that space.''

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Half an hour?''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) said, shaking the white flakes from his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) clothes; <div class="bookquote">``I
wonder you should select the thick of a snow-storm to ramble about in. Do
you know that you run a risk of being lost in the marshes? People
familiar with these moors often miss their road on such evenings; and I
can tell you there is no chance of a change at present.''

 (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Perhaps I can get a guide among your lads, and he (<font color='blue'><b>I</b></font>) might stay at the
Grange till morning--could you spare me one?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``No, I could not.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Oh, indeed! Well, then, I must trust to my own sagacity.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Umph!''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Are you going to mak' the tea?''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>demanded he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) of the shabby coat, shifting
his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) ferocious gaze from me to the young lady.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Is _he (<font color='blue'><b>I</b></font>)_ to have any?''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) asked, appealing to Heathcliff.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Get it ready, will you?''  (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div>was the answer, uttered so savagely that I
started. The tone in which the words were said revealed a genuine bad
nature. I no longer felt inclined to call Heathcliff a capital fellow.
When the preparations were finished, he (<font color='blue'><b>Heathcliff</b></font>) invited me with--<div class="bookquote">``Now, sir, bring
forward your chair.''  (<font color='red'><b>me</b></font>)</div>And we all, including the rustic youth, drew round
the table: an austere silence prevailing while we discussed our meal.

<p/>I thought, if I had caused the cloud, it was my duty to make an effort to
dispel it. They could not every day sit so grim and taciturn; and it was
impossible, however ill-tempered they might be, that the universal scowl
they wore was their every-day countenance.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``It is strange,''  (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div>I began, in the interval of swallowing one cup of tea
and receiving another--`it is strange how custom can mould our tastes and
ideas: many could not imagine the existence of happiness in a life of
such complete exile from the world as you spend, Mr. Heathcliff; yet,
I'll venture to say, that, surrounded by your family, and with your
amiable lady as the presiding genius over your home and heart--'

<p/><div class="bookquote">``My amiable lady!''  (<font color='red'><b>the genius</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>genius</b></font>) interrupted, with an almost diabolical sneer on his (<font color='blue'><b>genius</b></font>)
face. <div class="bookquote">``Where is she (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>)--my amiable lady?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Mrs. Heathcliff, your wife, I mean.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Well, yes--oh, you would intimate that her (<font color='blue'><b>Heathcliff</b></font>) spirit has taken the post of
ministering angel, and guards the fortunes of Wuthering Heights, even
when her (<font color='blue'><b>Heathcliff</b></font>) body is gone. Is that it?''

 (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div><p/>Perceiving myself in a blunder, I attempted to correct it. I might have
seen there was too great a disparity between the ages of the parties to
make it likely that they were man and wife. One was about forty: a
period of mental vigour at which men seldom cherish the delusion of being
married for love by girls: that dream is reserved for the solace of our
declining years. The other did not look seventeen.

<p/>Then it flashed upon me--<div class="bookquote">``The clown at my elbow, who is drinking his (<font color='blue'><b>clown</b></font>) tea
out of a basin and eating his (<font color='blue'><b>clown</b></font>) bread with unwashed hands, may be her (<font color='blue'><b>Heathcliff</b></font>)
husband: Heathcliff junior, of course. Here is the consequence of being
buried alive: she (<font color='blue'><b>Heathcliff</b></font>) has thrown herself away upon that boor from sheer
ignorance that better individuals existed! A sad pity--I must beware how
I cause her (<font color='blue'><b>Heathcliff</b></font>) to regret her (<font color='blue'><b>Heathcliff</b></font>) choice.''  (<font color='red'><b>me</b></font>)</div>The last reflection may seem
conceited; it was not. My neighbour struck me as bordering on repulsive;
I knew, through experience, that I was tolerably attractive.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Mrs. Heathcliff is my daughter-in-law,''  (<font color='red'><b>Heathcliff/Mr. Heathcliff</b></font>)</div>said Heathcliff, corroborating
my surmise. He (<font color='blue'><b>Heathcliff</b></font>) turned, as he (<font color='blue'><b>Heathcliff</b></font>) spoke, a peculiar look in her (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>) direction: a
look of hatred; unless he (<font color='blue'><b>Heathcliff</b></font>) has a most perverse set of facial muscles that
will not, like those of other people, interpret the language of his (<font color='blue'><b>Heathcliff</b></font>) soul.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Ah, certainly--I see now: you are the favoured possessor of the
beneficent fairy,''  (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div>I remarked, turning to my neighbour.

<p/>This was worse than before: the youth grew crimson, and clenched his (<font color='blue'><b>Heathcliff</b></font>)
fist, with every appearance of a meditated assault. But he (<font color='blue'><b>Heathcliff</b></font>) seemed to
recollect himself presently, and smothered the storm in a brutal curse,
muttered on my behalf: which, however, I took care not to notice.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Unhappy in your conjectures, sir,''  (<font color='red'><b>fairy</b></font>)</div>observed my host; `we neither of us
have the privilege of owning your good fairy; her (<font color='blue'><b>fairy</b></font>) mate is dead. I said
she (<font color='blue'><b>fairy</b></font>) was my daughter-in-law: therefore, she (<font color='blue'><b>fairy</b></font>) must have married my son.''

<p/>``And this young man is--'

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Not my son, assuredly.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Heathcliff/Mr. Heathcliff</b></font>)</div><p/>Heathcliff smiled again, as if it were rather too bold a jest to
attribute the paternity of that bear to him (<font color='blue'><b>Heathcliff</b></font>).

<p/><div class="bookquote">``My name is Hareton Earnshaw,''  (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div>growled the other; `and I'd counsel you to
respect it!''

<p/><div class="bookquote">``I've shown no disrespect,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>was my reply, laughing internally at the
dignity with which he (<font color='blue'><b>counsel</b></font>) announced himself.

<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>counsel</b></font>) fixed his (<font color='blue'><b>counsel</b></font>) eye on me longer than I cared to return the stare, for fear
I might be tempted either to box his (<font color='blue'><b>counsel</b></font>) ears or render my hilarity audible.
I began to feel unmistakably out of place in that pleasant family circle.
The dismal spiritual atmosphere overcame, and more than neutralised, the
glowing physical comforts round me; and I resolved to be cautious how I
ventured under those rafters a third time.

<p/>The business of eating being concluded, and no one uttering a word of
sociable conversation, I approached a window to examine the weather. A
sorrowful sight I saw: dark night coming down prematurely, and sky and
hills mingled in one bitter whirl of wind and suffocating snow.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``I don't think it possible for me to get home now without a guide,''  (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div>I
could not help exclaiming. <div class="bookquote">``The roads will be buried already; and, if
they were bare, I could scarcely distinguish a foot in advance.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Hareton, drive those dozen sheep into the barn porch. They'll be
covered if left in the fold all night: and put a plank before them,''  (<font color='red'><b>Heathcliff/Mr. Heathcliff</b></font>)</div>said
Heathcliff.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``How must I do?''  (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div>I continued, with rising irritation.

<p/>There was no reply to my question; and on looking round I saw only Joseph
bringing in a pail of porridge for the dogs, and Mrs. Heathcliff leaning
over the fire, diverting herself with burning a bundle of matches which
had fallen from the chimney-piece as she (<font color='blue'><b>Heathcliff</b></font>) restored the tea-canister to its
place. The former, when he (<font color='blue'><b>Joseph</b></font>) had deposited his (<font color='blue'><b>Joseph</b></font>) burden, took a critical
survey of the room, and in cracked tones grated out--<div class="bookquote">``Aw wonder how yah
can faishion to stand thear i' idleness un war, when all on 'ems goan
out! Bud yah're a nowt, and it's no use talking--yah'll niver mend o'yer
ill ways, but goa raight to t' divil, like yer mother afore ye!''

 (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div><p/>I imagined, for a moment, that this piece of eloquence was addressed to
me; and, sufficiently enraged, stepped towards the aged rascal with an
intention of kicking him (<font color='blue'><b>rascal</b></font>) out of the door. Mrs. Heathcliff, however,
checked me by her (<font color='blue'><b>Heathcliff</b></font>) answer.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``You scandalous old hypocrite!''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Heathcliff</b></font>) replied. <div class="bookquote">``Are you not afraid of
being carried away bodily, whenever you mention the devil's name? I warn
you to refrain from provoking me, or I'll ask your abduction as a special
favour! Stop! look here, Joseph,''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Heathcliff</b></font>) continued, taking a long, dark
book from a shelf; <div class="bookquote">``I'll show you how far I've progressed in the Black
Art: I shall soon be competent to make a clear house of it. The red cow
didn't die by chance; and your rheumatism can hardly be reckoned among
providential visitations!''

 (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Oh, wicked, wicked!''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>gasped the elder; `may the Lord deliver us from
evil!''

<p/><div class="bookquote">``No, reprobate! you are a castaway--be off, or I'll hurt you seriously!
I'll have you all modelled in wax and clay! and the first who passes the
limits I fix shall--I'll not say what he (<font color='blue'><b>Black</b></font>) shall be done to--but, you'll
see! Go, I'm looking at you!''

 (<font color='red'><b>The witch</b></font>)</div><p/>The little witch put a mock malignity into her (<font color='blue'><b>witch</b></font>) beautiful eyes, and
Joseph, trembling with sincere horror, hurried out, praying, and
ejaculating `wicked' as he (<font color='blue'><b>Joseph</b></font>) went. I thought her (<font color='blue'><b>witch</b></font>) conduct must be prompted
by a species of dreary fun; and, now that we were alone, I endeavoured to
interest her (<font color='blue'><b>witch</b></font>) in my distress.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Mrs. Heathcliff,''  (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div>I said earnestly, `you must excuse me for troubling
you. I presume, because, with that face, I'm sure you cannot help being
good-hearted. Do point out some landmarks by which I may know my way
home: I have no more idea how to get there than you would have how to get
to London!''

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Take the road you came,''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>witch</b></font>) answered, ensconcing herself in a chair,
with a candle, and the long book open before her (<font color='blue'><b>witch</b></font>). <div class="bookquote">``It is brief advice,
but as sound as I can give.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Then, if you hear of me being discovered dead in a bog or a pit full of
snow, your conscience won't whisper that it is partly your fault?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``How so? I cannot escort you. They wouldn't let me go to the end of the
garden wall.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/>'_You_! I should be sorry to ask you to cross the threshold, for my
convenience, on such a night,'' I cried. <div class="bookquote">``I want you to tell me my way,
not to _show_ it: or else to persuade Mr. Heathcliff to give me a guide.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Who? There is himself, Earnshaw, Zillah, Joseph and I. Which would you
have?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Are there no boys at the farm?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``No; those are all.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Then, it follows that I am compelled to stay.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``That you may settle with your host. I have nothing to do with it.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I hope it will be a lesson to you to make no more rash journeys on these
hills,''  (<font color='red'><b>Heathcliff/Mr. Heathcliff</b></font>)</div>cried Heathcliff's stern voice from the kitchen entrance. <div class="bookquote">``As to
staying here, I don't keep accommodations for visitors: you must share a
bed with Hareton or Joseph, if you do.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I can sleep on a chair in this room,''  (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div>I replied.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``No, no! A stranger is a stranger, be he (<font color='blue'><b>stranger</b></font>) rich or poor: it will not suit
me to permit any one the range of the place while I am off guard!''  (<font color='red'><b>the wretch</b></font>)</div>said
the unmannerly wretch.

<p/>With this insult my patience was at an end. I uttered an expression of
disgust, and pushed past him (<font color='blue'><b>Heathcliff</b></font>) into the yard, running against Earnshaw in
my haste. It was so dark that I could not see the means of exit; and, as
I wandered round, I heard another specimen of their civil behaviour
amongst each other. At first the young man appeared about to befriend
me.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``I'll go with him (<font color='blue'><b>guard</b></font>) as far as the park,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) said.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``You'll go with him (<font color='blue'><b>guard</b></font>) to hell!''  (<font color='red'><b>master</b></font>)</div>exclaimed his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) master, or whatever relation
he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) bore. <div class="bookquote">``And who is to look after the horses, eh?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``A man's life is of more consequence than one evening's neglect of the
horses: somebody must go,''  (<font color='red'><b>Linton/Mrs. Linton/Mrs. Heathcliff</b></font>)</div>murmured Mrs. Heathcliff, more kindly than I
expected.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Not at your command!''  (<font color='red'><b>Hareton/Hareton Earnshaw/Earnshaw</b></font>)</div>retorted Hareton. <div class="bookquote">``If you set store on him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>), you'd
better be quiet.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Then I hope his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) ghost will haunt you; and I hope Mr. Heathcliff will
never get another tenant till the Grange is a ruin,''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Heathcliff</b></font>) answered,
sharply.

<p/>``Hearken, hearken, shoo's cursing on <div class="bookquote">``em!''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>muttered Joseph, towards whom
I had been steering.

<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Joseph</b></font>) sat within earshot, milking the cows by the light of a lantern, which
I seized unceremoniously, and, calling out that I would send it back on
the morrow, rushed to the nearest postern.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Maister, maister, he (<font color='blue'><b>Heathcliff</b></font>)'s staling t' lanthern!''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>shouted the ancient,
pursuing my retreat. <div class="bookquote">``Hey, Gnasher! Hey, dog! Hey Wolf, holld him (<font color='blue'><b>Wolf</b></font>),
holld him (<font color='blue'><b>Wolf</b></font>)!''

 (<font color='red'><b>monsters</b></font>)</div><p/>On opening the little door, two hairy monsters flew at my throat, bearing
me down, and extinguishing the light; while a mingled guffaw from
Heathcliff and Hareton put the copestone on my rage and humiliation.
Fortunately, the beasts seemed more bent on stretching their paws, and
yawning, and flourishing their tails, than devouring me alive; but they
would suffer no resurrection, and I was forced to lie till their
malignant masters pleased to deliver me: then, hatless and trembling with
wrath, I ordered the miscreants to let me out--on their peril to keep me
one minute longer--with several incoherent threats of retaliation that,
in their indefinite depth of virulency, smacked of King Lear.

<p/>The vehemence of my agitation brought on a copious bleeding at the nose,
and still Heathcliff laughed, and still I scolded. I don't know what
would have concluded the scene, had there not been one person at hand
rather more rational than myself, and more benevolent than my
entertainer. This was Zillah, the stout housewife; who at length issued
forth to inquire into the nature of the uproar. She (<font color='blue'><b>housewife</b></font>) thought that some of
them had been laying violent hands on me; and, not daring to attack her (<font color='blue'><b>housewife</b></font>)
master, she (<font color='blue'><b>housewife</b></font>) turned her (<font color='blue'><b>housewife</b></font>) vocal artillery against the younger scoundrel.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Well, Mr. Earnshaw,''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>housewife</b></font>) cried, <div class="bookquote">``I wonder what you'll have agait next?
Are we going to murder folk on our very door-stones? I see this house
will never do for me--look at t' poor lad, he (<font color='blue'><b>lad</b></font>)'s fair choking! Wisht,
wisht; you mun'n't go on so. Come in, and I'll cure that: there now,
hold ye still.''

 (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div><p/>With these words she (<font color='blue'><b>housewife</b></font>) suddenly splashed a pint of icy water down my neck,
and pulled me into the kitchen. Mr. Heathcliff followed, his (<font color='blue'><b>Heathcliff</b></font>) accidental
merriment expiring quickly in his (<font color='blue'><b>Heathcliff</b></font>) habitual moroseness.

<p/>I was sick exceedingly, and dizzy, and faint; and thus compelled perforce
to accept lodgings under his (<font color='blue'><b>Heathcliff</b></font>) roof. He (<font color='blue'><b>Heathcliff</b></font>) told Zillah to give me a glass of
brandy, and then passed on to the inner room; while she (<font color='blue'><b>housewife</b></font>) condoled with me
on my sorry predicament, and having obeyed his (<font color='blue'><b>Heathcliff</b></font>) orders, whereby I was
somewhat revived, ushered me to bed.




<p/>CHAPTER III


<p/>While leading the way upstairs, she (<font color='blue'><b>housewife</b></font>) recommended that I should hide the
candle, and not make a noise; for her (<font color='blue'><b>housewife</b></font>) master had an odd notion about the
chamber she (<font color='blue'><b>housewife</b></font>) would put me in, and never let anybody lodge there willingly.
I asked the reason. She (<font color='blue'><b>housewife</b></font>) did not know, she (<font color='blue'><b>housewife</b></font>) answered: she (<font color='blue'><b>housewife</b></font>) had only lived
there a year or two; and they had so many queer goings on, she (<font color='blue'><b>housewife</b></font>) could not
begin to be curious.

<p/>Too stupefied to be curious myself, I fastened my door and glanced round
for the bed. The whole furniture consisted of a chair, a clothes-press,
and a large oak case, with squares cut out near the top resembling coach
windows. Having approached this structure, I looked inside, and
perceived it to be a singular sort of old-fashioned couch, very
conveniently designed to obviate the necessity for every member of the
family having a room to himself. In fact, it formed a little closet, and
the ledge of a window, which it enclosed, served as a table. I slid back
the panelled sides, got in with my light, pulled them together again, and
felt secure against the vigilance of Heathcliff, and every one else.

<p/>The ledge, where I placed my candle, had a few mildewed books piled up in
one corner; and it was covered with writing scratched on the paint. This
writing, however, was nothing but a name repeated in all kinds of
characters, large and small--_Catherine Earnshaw_, here and there varied
to _Catherine Heathcliff_, and then again to _Catherine Linton_.

<p/>In vapid listlessness I leant my head against the window, and continued
spelling over Catherine Earnshaw--Heathcliff--Linton, till my eyes
closed; but they had not rested five minutes when a glare of white
letters started from the dark, as vivid as spectres--the air swarmed with
Catherines; and rousing myself to dispel the obtrusive name, I discovered
my candle-wick reclining on one of the antique volumes, and perfuming the
place with an odour of roasted calf-skin. I snuffed it off, and, very
ill at ease under the influence of cold and lingering nausea, sat up and
spread open the injured tome on my knee. It was a Testament, in lean
type, and smelling dreadfully musty: a fly-leaf bore the
inscription--<div class="bookquote">``Catherine Earnshaw, her (<font color='blue'><b>Earnshaw</b></font>) book,''  (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div>and a date some quarter of a
century back. I shut it, and took up another and another, till I had
examined all. Catherine's library was select, and its state of
dilapidation proved it to have been well used, though not altogether for
a legitimate purpose: scarcely one chapter had escaped, a pen-and-ink
commentary--at least the appearance of one--covering every morsel of
blank that the printer had left. Some were detached sentences; other
parts took the form of a regular diary, scrawled in an unformed, childish
hand. At the top of an extra page -LRB-quite a treasure, probably, when
first lighted on-RRB- I was greatly amused to behold an excellent caricature
of my friend Joseph,--rudely, yet powerfully sketched. An immediate
interest kindled within me for the unknown Catherine, and I began
forthwith to decipher her (<font color='blue'><b>Catherine</b></font>) faded hieroglyphics.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``An awful Sunday,''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>commenced the paragraph beneath. ``I wish my father
were back again. Hindley is a detestable substitute--his (<font color='blue'><b>Hindley</b></font>) conduct to
Heathcliff is atrocious--H. and I are going to rebel--we took our
initiatory step this evening.

<p/>``All day had been flooding with rain; we could not go to church, so
Joseph must needs get up a congregation in the garret; and, while Hindley
and his (<font color='blue'><b>Hindley</b></font>) wife basked downstairs before a comfortable fire--doing anything
but reading their Bibles, I'll answer for it--Heathcliff, myself, and the
unhappy ploughboy were commanded to take our prayer-books, and mount: we
were ranged in a row, on a sack of corn, groaning and shivering, and
hoping that Joseph would shiver too, so that he (<font color='blue'><b>Joseph</b></font>) might give us a short
homily for his (<font color='blue'><b>Joseph</b></font>) own sake. A vain idea! The service lasted precisely
three hours; and yet my brother had the face to exclaim, when he (<font color='blue'><b>brother</b></font>) saw us
descending, <div class="bookquote">``What, done already?''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>On Sunday evenings we used to be
permitted to play, if we did not make much noise; now a mere titter is
sufficient to send us into corners.

<p/>'<div class="bookquote">``You forget you have a master here,''  (<font color='red'><b>the tyrant</b></font>)</div>says the tyrant. <div class="bookquote">``I'll demolish
the first who puts me out of temper! I insist on perfect sobriety and
silence. Oh, boy! was that you? Frances darling, pull his (<font color='blue'><b>Frances</b></font>) hair as you
go by: I heard him (<font color='blue'><b>Frances</b></font>) snap his (<font color='blue'><b>Frances</b></font>) fingers.''  (<font color='red'><b>Frances</b></font>)</div>Frances pulled his (<font color='blue'><b>Frances</b></font>) hair heartily,
and then went and seated herself on her (<font color='blue'><b>Catherine</b></font>) husband's knee, and there they
were, like two babies, kissing and talking nonsense by the hour--foolish
palaver that we should be ashamed of. We made ourselves as snug as our
means allowed in the arch of the dresser. I had just fastened our
pinafores together, and hung them up for a curtain, when in comes Joseph,
on an errand from the stables. He (<font color='blue'><b>Joseph</b></font>) tears down my handiwork, boxes my
ears, and croaks:

<p/>'<div class="bookquote">``T' maister nobbut just buried, and Sabbath not o'ered, und t' sound o'
t' gospel still i' yer lugs, and ye darr be laiking! Shame on ye! sit ye
down, ill childer! there's good books eneugh if ye'll read 'em: sit ye
down, and think o' yer sowls!''

 (<font color='red'><b>He</b></font>)</div><p/>``Saying this, he (<font color='blue'><b>Frances</b></font>) compelled us so to square our positions that we might
receive from the far-off fire a dull ray to show us the text of the
lumber he (<font color='blue'><b>Frances</b></font>) thrust upon us. I could not bear the employment. I took my
dingy volume by the scroop, and hurled it into the dog-kennel, vowing I
hated a good book. Heathcliff kicked his (<font color='blue'><b>Heathcliff</b></font>) to the same place. Then there
was a hubbub!

<p/>'<div class="bookquote">``Maister Hindley!''  (<font color='red'><b>chaplain</b></font>)</div>shouted our chaplain. ``Maister, coom hither! Miss
Cathy's riven th' back off ``Th' Helmet o' Salvation,'' un' Heathcliff's
pawsed his (<font color='blue'><b>Heathcliff</b></font>) fit into t' first part o' ``T' Brooad Way to Destruction!<div class="bookquote">'' It's
fair flaysome that ye let 'em go on this gait. Ech! th' owd man wad ha'
laced 'em properly--but he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>)'s goan!''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/>``Hindley hurried up from his (<font color='blue'><b>Hindley</b></font>) paradise on the hearth, and seizing one of
us by the collar, and the other by the arm, hurled both into the
back-kitchen; where, Joseph asseverated, ``owd Nick<div class="bookquote">'' would fetch us as
sure as we were living: and, so comforted, we each sought a separate
nook to await his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) advent. I reached this book, and a pot of ink from a
shelf, and pushed the house-door ajar to give me light, and I have got
the time on with writing for twenty minutes; but my companion is
impatient, and proposes that we should appropriate the dairywoman's
cloak, and have a scamper on the moors, under its shelter. A pleasant
suggestion--and then, if the surly old man come in, he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) may believe his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>)
prophecy verified--we cannot be damper, or colder, in the rain than we
are here.''

 (<font color='red'><b>owd Nick</b></font>)</div><p/>* * * * * *

<p/>I suppose Catherine fulfilled her (<font color='blue'><b>Catherine</b></font>) project, for the next sentence took up
another subject: she (<font color='blue'><b>Catherine</b></font>) waxed lachrymose.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``How little did I dream that Hindley would ever make me cry so!''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Catherine</b></font>)

<p/>* * * * * *

<p/>I began to nod drowsily over the dim page: my eye wandered from
manuscript to print. I saw a red ornamented title--<div class="bookquote">``Seventy Times Seven,
and the First of the Seventy-First. A Pious Discourse delivered by the
Reverend Jabez Branderham, in the Chapel of Gimmerden Sough.''  (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div>And while
I was, half-consciously, worrying my brain to guess what Jabez Branderham
would make of his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) subject, I sank back in bed, and fell asleep. Alas,
for the effects of bad tea and bad temper! What else could it be that
made me pass such a terrible night? I don't remember another that I can
at all compare with it since I was capable of suffering.

<p/>I began to dream, almost before I ceased to be sensible of my locality. I
thought it was morning; and I had set out on my way home, with Joseph for
a guide. The snow lay yards deep in our road; and, as we floundered on,
my companion wearied me with constant reproaches that I had not brought a
pilgrim's staff: telling me that I could never get into the house without
one, and boastfully flourishing a heavy-headed cudgel, which I understood
to be so denominated. For a moment I considered it absurd that I should
need such a weapon to gain admittance into my own residence. Then a new
idea flashed across me. I was not going there: we were journeying to
hear the famous Jabez Branderham preach, from the text--``Seventy Times
Seven;' and either Joseph, the preacher, or I had committed the <div class="bookquote">``First of
the Seventy-First,''  (<font color='red'><b>Jabez Branderham/Jabez/Branderham</b></font>)</div>and were to be publicly exposed and excommunicated.

<p/>We came to the chapel. I have passed it really in my walks, twice or
thrice; it lies in a hollow, between two hills: an elevated hollow, near
a swamp, whose peaty moisture is said to answer all the purposes of
embalming on the few corpses deposited there. The roof has been kept
whole hitherto; but as the clergyman's stipend is only twenty pounds per
annum, and a house with two rooms, threatening speedily to determine into
one, no clergyman will undertake the duties of pastor: especially as it
is currently reported that his (<font color='blue'><b>clergyman</b></font>) flock would rather let him (<font color='blue'><b>clergyman</b></font>) starve than
increase the living by one penny from their own pockets. However, in my
dream, Jabez had a full and attentive congregation; and he (<font color='blue'><b>clergyman</b></font>) preached--good
God! what a sermon; divided into _four hundred and ninety_ parts, each
fully equal to an ordinary address from the pulpit, and each discussing a
separate sin! Where he (<font color='blue'><b>clergyman</b></font>) searched for them, I cannot tell. He (<font color='blue'><b>clergyman</b></font>) had his (<font color='blue'><b>clergyman</b></font>)
private manner of interpreting the phrase, and it seemed necessary the
brother should sin different sins on every occasion. They were of the
most curious character: odd transgressions that I never imagined
previously.

<p/>Oh, how weary I grow. How I writhed, and yawned, and nodded, and
revived! How I pinched and pricked myself, and rubbed my eyes, and stood
up, and sat down again, and nudged Joseph to inform me if he (<font color='blue'><b>Joseph</b></font>) would _ever_
have done. I was condemned to hear all out: finally, he (<font color='blue'><b>Joseph</b></font>) reached the
'_First of the Seventy-First_.'' At that crisis, a sudden inspiration
descended on me; I was moved to rise and denounce Jabez Branderham as the
sinner of the sin that no Christian need pardon.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Sir,''  (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div>I exclaimed, `sitting here within these four walls, at one
stretch, I have endured and forgiven the four hundred and ninety heads of
your discourse. Seventy times seven times have I plucked up my hat and
been about to depart--Seventy times seven times have you preposterously
forced me to resume my seat. The four hundred and ninety-first is too
much. Fellow-martyrs, have at him (<font color='blue'><b>sinner</b></font>)! Drag him (<font color='blue'><b>sinner</b></font>) down, and crush him (<font color='blue'><b>sinner</b></font>) to
atoms, that the place which knows him (<font color='blue'><b>sinner</b></font>) may know him (<font color='blue'><b>sinner</b></font>) no more!''

<p/>'_Thou art the Man_!'' cried Jabez, after a solemn pause, leaning over his (<font color='blue'><b>sinner</b></font>)
cushion. <div class="bookquote">``Seventy times seven times didst thou gapingly contort thy
visage--seventy times seven did I take counsel with my soul--Lo, this is
human weakness: this also may be absolved! The First of the
Seventy-First is come. Brethren, execute upon him (<font color='blue'><b>counsel</b></font>) the judgment written.
Such honour have all His (<font color='blue'><b>counsel</b></font>) saints!''

 (<font color='red'><b>pilgrim</b></font>)</div><p/>With that concluding word, the whole assembly, exalting their pilgrim's
staves, rushed round me in a body; and I, having no weapon to raise in
self-defence, commenced grappling with Joseph, my nearest and most
ferocious assailant, for his (<font color='blue'><b>Joseph</b></font>). In the confluence of the multitude,
several clubs crossed; blows, aimed at me, fell on other sconces.
Presently the whole chapel resounded with rappings and counter rappings:
every man's hand was against his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) neighbour; and Branderham, unwilling to
remain idle, poured forth his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) zeal in a shower of loud taps on the boards
of the pulpit, which responded so smartly that, at last, to my
unspeakable relief, they woke me. And what was it that had suggested the
tremendous tumult? What had played Jabez's part in the row? Merely the
branch of a fir-tree that touched my lattice as the blast wailed by, and
rattled its dry cones against the panes! I listened doubtingly an
instant; detected the disturber, then turned and dozed, and dreamt again:
if possible, still more disagreeably than before.

<p/>This time, I remembered I was lying in the oak closet, and I heard
distinctly the gusty wind, and the driving of the snow; I heard, also,
the fir bough repeat its teasing sound, and ascribed it to the right
cause: but it annoyed me so much, that I resolved to silence it, if
possible; and, I thought, I rose and endeavoured to unhasp the casement.
The hook was soldered into the staple: a circumstance observed by me when
awake, but forgotten. <div class="bookquote">``I must stop it, nevertheless!''  (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div>I muttered,
knocking my knuckles through the glass, and stretching an arm out to
seize the importunate branch; instead of which, my fingers closed on the
fingers of a little, ice-cold hand! The intense horror of nightmare came
over me: I tried to draw back my arm, but the hand clung to it, and a
most melancholy voice sobbed, <div class="bookquote">``Let me in--let me in!''  (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``Who are you?''  (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div>I
asked, struggling, meanwhile, to disengage myself. <div class="bookquote">``Catherine Linton,''
 (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div>it replied, shiveringly -LRB-why did I think of _Linton_? I had read
_Earnshaw_ twenty times for Linton-RRB---<div class="bookquote">``I'm come home: I'd lost my way on
the moor!''  (<font color='red'><b>Linton/Mrs. Linton/Mrs. Heathcliff</b></font>)</div>As it spoke, I discerned, obscurely, a child's face looking
through the window. Terror made me cruel; and, finding it useless to
attempt shaking the creature off, I pulled its wrist on to the broken
pane, and rubbed it to and fro till the blood ran down and soaked the
bedclothes: still it wailed, <div class="bookquote">``Let me in!''  (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div>and maintained its tenacious
grip, almost maddening me with fear. <div class="bookquote">``How can I!''  (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div>I said at length.
<div class="bookquote">``Let _me_ go, if you want me to let you in!''  (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div>The fingers relaxed, I
snatched mine through the hole, hurriedly piled the books up in a pyramid
against it, and stopped my ears to exclude the lamentable prayer. I
seemed to keep them closed above a quarter of an hour; yet, the instant I
listened again, there was the doleful cry moaning on! <div class="bookquote">``Begone!''  (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div>I
shouted. <div class="bookquote">``I'll never let you in, not if you beg for twenty years.''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``It
is twenty years,''  (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div>mourned the voice: `twenty years. I've been a waif for
twenty years!'' Thereat began a feeble scratching outside, and the pile
of books moved as if thrust forward. I tried to jump up; but could not
stir a limb; and so yelled aloud, in a frenzy of fright. To my
confusion, I discovered the yell was not ideal: hasty footsteps
approached my chamber door; somebody pushed it open, with a vigorous
hand, and a light glimmered through the squares at the top of the bed. I
sat shuddering yet, and wiping the perspiration from my forehead: the
intruder appeared to hesitate, and muttered to himself. At last, he (<font color='blue'><b>intruder</b></font>)
said, in a half-whisper, plainly not expecting an answer, <div class="bookquote">``Is any one
here?''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>I considered it best to confess my presence; for I knew
Heathcliff's accents, and feared he (<font color='blue'><b>Heathcliff</b></font>) might search further, if I kept
quiet. With this intention, I turned and opened the panels. I shall not
soon forget the effect my action produced.

<p/>Heathcliff stood near the entrance, in his (<font color='blue'><b>Heathcliff</b></font>) shirt and trousers; with a
candle dripping over his (<font color='blue'><b>Heathcliff</b></font>) fingers, and his (<font color='blue'><b>Heathcliff</b></font>) face as white as the wall
behind him (<font color='blue'><b>Heathcliff</b></font>). The first creak of the oak startled him (<font color='blue'><b>Heathcliff</b></font>) like an electric
shock: the light leaped from his (<font color='blue'><b>Heathcliff</b></font>) hold to a distance of some feet, and his (<font color='blue'><b>Heathcliff</b></font>)
agitation was so extreme, that he (<font color='blue'><b>Heathcliff</b></font>) could hardly pick it up.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``It is only your guest, sir,''  (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div>I called out, desirous to spare him (<font color='blue'><b>Heathcliff</b></font>) the
humiliation of exposing his (<font color='blue'><b>Heathcliff</b></font>) cowardice further. <div class="bookquote">``I had the misfortune to
scream in my sleep, owing to a frightful nightmare. I'm sorry I
disturbed you.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/>``Oh, God confound you, Mr. Lockwood! I wish you were at the--' commenced
my host, setting the candle on a chair, because he (<font color='blue'><b>God</b></font>) found it impossible to
hold it steady. ``And who showed you up into this room?'' he (<font color='blue'><b>Heathcliff</b></font>) continued,
crushing his (<font color='blue'><b>Heathcliff</b></font>) nails into his (<font color='blue'><b>Heathcliff</b></font>) palms, and grinding his (<font color='blue'><b>Heathcliff</b></font>) teeth to subdue the
maxillary convulsions. <div class="bookquote">``Who was it? I've a good mind to turn them out
of the house this moment?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``It was your servant Zillah,''  (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div>I replied, flinging myself on to the floor,
and rapidly resuming my garments. <div class="bookquote">``I should not care if you did, Mr.
Heathcliff; she (<font color='blue'><b>I</b></font>) richly deserves it. I suppose that she (<font color='blue'><b>I</b></font>) wanted to get
another proof that the place was haunted, at my expense. Well, it
is--swarming with ghosts and goblins! You have reason in shutting it up,
I assure you. No one will thank you for a doze in such a den!''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``What do you mean?''  (<font color='red'><b>Heathcliff/Mr. Heathcliff</b></font>)</div>asked Heathcliff, `and what are you doing? Lie down
and finish out the night, since you _are_ here; but, for heaven's sake!
don't repeat that horrid noise: nothing could excuse it, unless you were
having your throat cut!''

<p/><div class="bookquote">``If the little fiend had got in at the window, she (<font color='blue'><b>I</b></font>) probably would have
strangled me!''  (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div>I returned. <div class="bookquote">``I'm not going to endure the persecutions of
your hospitable ancestors again. Was not the Reverend Jabez Branderham
akin to you on the mother's side? And that minx, Catherine Linton, or
Earnshaw, or however she (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) was called--she (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) must have been a
changeling--wicked little soul! She (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) told me she (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) had been walking the
earth these twenty years: a just punishment for her (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) mortal
transgressions, I've no doubt!''

 (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div><p/>Scarcely were these words uttered when I recollected the association of
Heathcliff's with Catherine's name in the book, which had completely
slipped from my memory, till thus awakened. I blushed at my
inconsideration: but, without showing further consciousness of the
offence, I hastened to add--<div class="bookquote">``The truth is, sir, I passed the first part
of the night in--' Here I stopped afresh--I was about to say `perusing
those old volumes,''  (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div>then it would have revealed my knowledge of their
written, as well as their printed, contents; so, correcting myself, I
went on--`in spelling over the name scratched on that window-ledge. A
monotonous occupation, calculated to set me asleep, like counting, or--'

<p/><div class="bookquote">``What _can_ you mean by talking in this way to _me_!''  (<font color='red'><b>me</b></font>)</div>thundered
Heathcliff with savage vehemence. <div class="bookquote">``How--how _dare_ you, under my
roof?--God! he (<font color='blue'><b>God</b></font>)'s mad to speak so!''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>And he (<font color='blue'><b>Heathcliff</b></font>) struck his (<font color='blue'><b>Heathcliff</b></font>) forehead with rage.

<p/>I did not know whether to resent this language or pursue my explanation;
but he (<font color='blue'><b>Heathcliff</b></font>) seemed so powerfully affected that I took pity and proceeded with
my dreams; affirming I had never heard the appellation of ``Catherine
Linton' before, but reading it often over produced an impression which
personified itself when I had no longer my imagination under control.
Heathcliff gradually fell back into the shelter of the bed, as I spoke;
finally sitting down almost concealed behind it. I guessed, however, by
his (<font color='blue'><b>Heathcliff</b></font>) irregular and intercepted breathing, that he (<font color='blue'><b>Heathcliff</b></font>) struggled to vanquish an
excess of violent emotion. Not liking to show him (<font color='blue'><b>Heathcliff</b></font>) that I had heard the
conflict, I continued my toilette rather noisily, looked at my watch, and
soliloquised on the length of the night: <div class="bookquote">``Not three o'clock yet! I could
have taken oath it had been six. Time stagnates here: we must surely
have retired to rest at eight!''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Always at nine in winter, and rise at four,''  (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div>said my host, suppressing a
groan: and, as I fancied, by the motion of his (<font color='blue'><b>Heathcliff</b></font>) arm's shadow, dashing a
tear from his (<font color='blue'><b>Heathcliff</b></font>) eyes. <div class="bookquote">``Mr. Lockwood,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Heathcliff</b></font>) added, `you may go into my room:
you'll only be in the way, coming down-stairs so early: and your childish
outcry has sent sleep to the devil for me.''

<p/><div class="bookquote">``And for me, too,''  (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div>I replied. <div class="bookquote">``I'll walk in the yard till daylight, and
then I'll be off; and you need not dread a repetition of my intrusion.
I'm now quite cured of seeking pleasure in society, be it country or
town. A sensible man ought to find sufficient company in himself.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Delightful company!''  (<font color='red'><b>Heathcliff/Mr. Heathcliff</b></font>)</div>muttered Heathcliff. <div class="bookquote">``Take the candle, and go
where you please. I shall join you directly. Keep out of the yard,
though, the dogs are unchained; and the house--Juno mounts sentinel
there, and--nay, you can only ramble about the steps and passages. But,
away with you! I'll come in two minutes!''

 (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div><p/>I obeyed, so far as to quit the chamber; when, ignorant where the narrow
lobbies led, I stood still, and was witness, involuntarily, to a piece of
superstition on the part of my landlord which belied, oddly, his (<font color='blue'><b>witness</b></font>) apparent
sense. He (<font color='blue'><b>witness</b></font>) got on to the bed, and wrenched open the lattice, bursting, as
he (<font color='blue'><b>witness</b></font>) pulled at it, into an uncontrollable passion of tears. <div class="bookquote">``Come in! come
in!''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>witness</b></font>) sobbed. <div class="bookquote">``Cathy, do come. Oh, do--_once_ more! Oh! my heart's
darling! hear me _this_ time, Catherine, at last!''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>The spectre showed a
spectre's ordinary caprice: it gave no sign of being; but the snow and
wind whirled wildly through, even reaching my station, and blowing out
the light.

<p/>There was such anguish in the gush of grief that accompanied this raving,
that my compassion made me overlook its folly, and I drew off, half angry
to have listened at all, and vexed at having related my ridiculous
nightmare, since it produced that agony; though _why_ was beyond my
comprehension. I descended cautiously to the lower regions, and landed
in the back-kitchen, where a gleam of fire, raked compactly together,
enabled me to rekindle my candle. Nothing was stirring except a
brindled, grey cat, which crept from the ashes, and saluted me with a
querulous mew.

<p/>Two benches, shaped in sections of a circle, nearly enclosed the hearth;
on one of these I stretched myself, and Grimalkin mounted the other. We
were both of us nodding ere any one invaded our retreat, and then it was
Joseph, shuffling down a wooden ladder that vanished in the roof, through
a trap: the ascent to his (<font color='blue'><b>Joseph</b></font>) garret, I suppose. He (<font color='blue'><b>Joseph</b></font>) cast a sinister look at
the little flame which I had enticed to play between the ribs, swept the
cat from its elevation, and bestowing himself in the vacancy, commenced
the operation of stuffing a three-inch pipe with tobacco. My presence in
his (<font color='blue'><b>Joseph</b></font>) sanctum was evidently esteemed a piece of impudence too shameful for
remark: he (<font color='blue'><b>Joseph</b></font>) silently applied the tube to his (<font color='blue'><b>Joseph</b></font>) lips, folded his (<font color='blue'><b>Joseph</b></font>) arms, and
puffed away. I let him (<font color='blue'><b>Joseph</b></font>) enjoy the luxury unannoyed; and after sucking out
his (<font color='blue'><b>Joseph</b></font>) last wreath, and heaving a profound sigh, he (<font color='blue'><b>Joseph</b></font>) got up, and departed as
solemnly as he (<font color='blue'><b>Joseph</b></font>) came.

<p/>A more elastic footstep entered next; and now I opened my mouth for a
<div class="bookquote">``good-morning,''  (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div>but closed it again, the salutation unachieved; for
Hareton Earnshaw was performing his (<font color='blue'><b>Earnshaw</b></font>) orison _sotto voce_, in a series of
curses directed against every object he (<font color='blue'><b>Earnshaw</b></font>) touched, while he (<font color='blue'><b>Earnshaw</b></font>) rummaged a
corner for a spade or shovel to dig through the drifts. He (<font color='blue'><b>Earnshaw</b></font>) glanced over
the back of the bench, dilating his (<font color='blue'><b>Earnshaw</b></font>) nostrils, and thought as little of
exchanging civilities with me as with my companion the cat. I guessed,
by his (<font color='blue'><b>Earnshaw</b></font>) preparations, that egress was allowed, and, leaving my hard couch,
made a movement to follow him (<font color='blue'><b>Earnshaw</b></font>). He (<font color='blue'><b>Earnshaw</b></font>) noticed this, and thrust at an inner
door with the end of his (<font color='blue'><b>Earnshaw</b></font>) spade, intimating by an inarticulate sound that
there was the place where I must go, if I changed my locality.

<p/>It opened into the house, where the females were already astir; Zillah
urging flakes of flame up the chimney with a colossal bellows; and Mrs.
Heathcliff, kneeling on the hearth, reading a book by the aid of the
blaze. She (<font color='blue'><b>Heathcliff</b></font>) held her (<font color='blue'><b>Heathcliff</b></font>) hand interposed between the furnace-heat and her (<font color='blue'><b>Heathcliff</b></font>)
eyes, and seemed absorbed in her (<font color='blue'><b>Heathcliff</b></font>) occupation; desisting from it only to
chide the servant for covering her (<font color='blue'><b>Heathcliff</b></font>) with sparks, or to push away a dog,
now and then, that snoozled its nose overforwardly into her (<font color='blue'><b>Heathcliff</b></font>) face. I was
surprised to see Heathcliff there also. He (<font color='blue'><b>Heathcliff</b></font>) stood by the fire, his (<font color='blue'><b>Heathcliff</b></font>) back
towards me, just finishing a stormy scene with poor Zillah; who ever and
anon interrupted her (<font color='blue'><b>Heathcliff</b></font>) labour to pluck up the corner of her (<font color='blue'><b>Heathcliff</b></font>) apron, and
heave an indignant groan.

<p/>``And you, you worthless--' he (<font color='blue'><b>Juno</b></font>) broke out as I entered, turning to his (<font color='blue'><b>Juno</b></font>)
daughter-in-law, and employing an epithet as harmless as duck, or sheep,
but generally represented by a dash--. <div class="bookquote">``There you are, at your idle
tricks again! The rest of them do earn their bread--you live on my
charity! Put your trash away, and find something to do. You shall pay
me for the plague of having you eternally in my sight--do you hear,
damnable jade?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I'll put my trash away, because you can make me if I refuse,''  (<font color='red'><b>the lady</b></font>)</div>answered
the young lady, closing her (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) book, and throwing it on a chair. <div class="bookquote">``But I'll
not do anything, though you should swear your tongue out, except what I
please!''

 (<font color='red'><b>Heathcliff/Mr. Heathcliff</b></font>)</div><p/>Heathcliff lifted his (<font color='blue'><b>Heathcliff</b></font>) hand, and the speaker sprang to a safer distance,
obviously acquainted with its weight. Having no desire to be entertained
by a cat-and-dog combat, I stepped forward briskly, as if eager to
partake the warmth of the hearth, and innocent of any knowledge of the
interrupted dispute. Each had enough decorum to suspend further
hostilities: Heathcliff placed his (<font color='blue'><b>Heathcliff</b></font>) fists, out of temptation, in his (<font color='blue'><b>Heathcliff</b></font>)
pockets; Mrs. Heathcliff curled her (<font color='blue'><b>Heathcliff</b></font>) lip, and walked to a seat far off,
where she (<font color='blue'><b>Heathcliff</b></font>) kept her (<font color='blue'><b>Heathcliff</b></font>) word by playing the part of a statue during the
remainder of my stay. That was not long. I declined joining their
breakfast, and, at the first gleam of dawn, took an opportunity of
escaping into the free air, now clear, and still, and cold as impalpable
ice.

<p/>My landlord halloed for me to stop ere I reached the bottom of the
garden, and offered to accompany me across the moor. It was well he (<font color='blue'><b>lip</b></font>) did,
for the whole hill-back was one billowy, white ocean; the swells and
falls not indicating corresponding rises and depressions in the ground:
many pits, at least, were filled to a level; and entire ranges of mounds,
the refuse of the quarries, blotted from the chart which my yesterday's
walk left pictured in my mind. I had remarked on one side of the road,
at intervals of six or seven yards, a line of upright stones, continued
through the whole length of the barren: these were erected and daubed
with lime on purpose to serve as guides in the dark, and also when a
fall, like the present, confounded the deep swamps on either hand with
the firmer path: but, excepting a dirty dot pointing up here and there,
all traces of their existence had vanished: and my companion found it
necessary to warn me frequently to steer to the right or left, when I
imagined I was following, correctly, the windings of the road.

<p/>We exchanged little conversation, and he (<font color='blue'><b>companion</b></font>) halted at the entrance of
Thrushcross Park, saying, I could make no error there. Our adieux were
limited to a hasty bow, and then I pushed forward, trusting to my own
resources; for the porter's lodge is untenanted as yet. The distance
from the gate to the grange is two miles; I believe I managed to make it
four, what with losing myself among the trees, and sinking up to the neck
in snow: a predicament which only those who have experienced it can
appreciate. At any rate, whatever were my wanderings, the clock chimed
twelve as I entered the house; and that gave exactly an hour for every
mile of the usual way from Wuthering Heights.

<p/>My human fixture and her (<font color='blue'><b>porter</b></font>) satellites rushed to welcome me; exclaiming,
tumultuously, they had completely given me up: everybody conjectured that
I perished last night; and they were wondering how they must set about
the search for my remains. I bid them be quiet, now that they saw me
returned, and, benumbed to my very heart, I dragged up-stairs; whence,
after putting on dry clothes, and pacing to and fro thirty or forty
minutes, to restore the animal heat, I adjourned to my study, feeble as a
kitten: almost too much so to enjoy the cheerful fire and smoking coffee
which the servant had prepared for my refreshment.




<p/>CHAPTER IV


<p/>What vain weathercocks we are! I, who had determined to hold myself
independent of all social intercourse, and thanked my stars that, at
length, I had lighted on a spot where it was next to impracticable--I,
weak wretch, after maintaining till dusk a struggle with low spirits and
solitude, was finally compelled to strike my colours; and under pretence
of gaining information concerning the necessities of my establishment, I
desired Mrs. Dean, when she (<font color='blue'><b>Dean</b></font>) brought in supper, to sit down while I ate
it; hoping sincerely she (<font color='blue'><b>Dean</b></font>) would prove a regular gossip, and either rouse
me to animation or lull me to sleep by her (<font color='blue'><b>Dean</b></font>) talk.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``You have lived here a considerable time,''  (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div>I commenced; `did you not say
sixteen years?''

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Eighteen, sir: I came when the mistress was married, to wait on her (<font color='blue'><b>mistress</b></font>);
after she (<font color='blue'><b>mistress</b></font>) died, the master retained me for his (<font color='blue'><b>master</b></font>) housekeeper.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Indeed.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/>There ensued a pause. She (<font color='blue'><b>Dean</b></font>) was not a gossip, I feared; unless about her (<font color='blue'><b>Dean</b></font>)
own affairs, and those could hardly interest me. However, having studied
for an interval, with a fist on either knee, and a cloud of meditation
over her (<font color='blue'><b>Dean</b></font>) ruddy countenance, she (<font color='blue'><b>Dean</b></font>) ejaculated--<div class="bookquote">``Ah, times are greatly
changed since then!''

 (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Yes,''  (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div>I remarked, `you've seen a good many alterations, I suppose?''

<p/><div class="bookquote">``I have: and troubles too,''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Dean</b></font>) said.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Oh, I'll turn the talk on my landlord's family!''  (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div>I thought to myself. <div class="bookquote">``A
good subject to start! And that pretty girl-widow, I should like to know
her (<font color='blue'><b>mistress</b></font>) history: whether she (<font color='blue'><b>mistress</b></font>) be a native of the country, or, as is more
probable, an exotic that the surly _indigenae_ will not recognise for
kin.''  (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div>With this intention I asked Mrs. Dean why Heathcliff let
Thrushcross Grange, and preferred living in a situation and residence so
much inferior. <div class="bookquote">``Is he (<font color='blue'><b>kin</b></font>) not rich enough to keep the estate in good order?''
 (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div>I inquired.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Rich, sir!''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Dean</b></font>) returned. <div class="bookquote">``He (<font color='blue'><b>Rich</b></font>) has nobody knows what money, and every
year it increases. Yes, yes, he (<font color='blue'><b>Rich</b></font>)'s rich enough to live in a finer house
than this: but he (<font color='blue'><b>Rich</b></font>)'s very near--close-handed; and, if he (<font color='blue'><b>Rich</b></font>) had meant to flit
to Thrushcross Grange, as soon as he (<font color='blue'><b>Rich</b></font>) heard of a good tenant he (<font color='blue'><b>Rich</b></font>) could not
have borne to miss the chance of getting a few hundreds more. It is
strange people should be so greedy, when they are alone in the world!''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``He (<font color='blue'><b>Rich</b></font>) had a son, it seems?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Yes, he (<font color='blue'><b>Rich</b></font>) had one--he (<font color='blue'><b>Rich</b></font>) is dead.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``And that young lady, Mrs. Heathcliff, is his (<font color='blue'><b>Rich</b></font>) widow?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Yes.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Where did she (<font color='blue'><b>Heathcliff</b></font>) come from originally?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Why, sir, she (<font color='blue'><b>Heathcliff</b></font>) is my late master's daughter: Catherine Linton was her (<font color='blue'><b>Heathcliff</b></font>)
maiden name. I nursed her (<font color='blue'><b>Heathcliff</b></font>), poor thing! I did wish Mr. Heathcliff would
remove here, and then we might have been together again.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``What! Catherine Linton?''  (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div>I exclaimed, astonished. But a minute's
reflection convinced me it was not my ghostly Catherine. <div class="bookquote">``Then,''  (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div>I
continued, `my predecessor's name was Linton?''

<p/><div class="bookquote">``It was.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``And who is that Earnshaw: Hareton Earnshaw, who lives with Mr.
Heathcliff? Are they relations?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``No; he (<font color='blue'><b>Heathcliff</b></font>) is the late Mrs. Linton's nephew.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``The young lady's cousin, then?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Yes; and her (<font color='blue'><b>cousin</b></font>) husband was her (<font color='blue'><b>cousin</b></font>) cousin also: one on the mother's, the other
on the father's side: Heathcliff married Mr. Linton's sister.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/>``I see the house at Wuthering Heights has ``Earnshaw<div class="bookquote">'' carved over the

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Very old, sir; and Hareton is the last of them, as our Miss Cathy is of

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Mrs. Heathcliff? she (<font color='blue'><b>Heathcliff</b></font>) looked very well, and very handsome; yet, I think,
not very happy.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Oh dear, I don't wonder! And how did you like the master?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/>``A rough fellow, rather, Mrs. Dean. Is not that his (<font color='blue'><b>fellow</b></font>) character?

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Rough as a saw-edge, and hard as whinstone! The less you meddle with

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``It's a cuckoo's, sir--I know all about it: except where he (<font color='blue'><b>fellow</b></font>) was born, and
who were his (<font color='blue'><b>fellow</b></font>) parents, and how he (<font color='blue'><b>fellow</b></font>) got his (<font color='blue'><b>fellow</b></font>) money at first. And Hareton has
been cast out like an unfledged dunnock! The unfortunate lad is the only
one in all this parish that does not guess how he (<font color='blue'><b>lad</b></font>) has been cheated.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Well, Mrs. Dean, it will be a charitable deed to tell me something of my
neighbours: I feel I shall not rest if I go to bed; so be good enough to
sit and chat an hour.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Oh, certainly, sir! I'll just fetch a little sewing, and then I'll sit
as long as you please. But you've caught cold: I saw you shivering, and
you must have some gruel to drive it out.''

 (<font color='red'><b>The woman</b></font>)</div><p/>The worthy woman bustled off, and I crouched nearer the fire; my head
felt hot, and the rest of me chill: moreover, I was excited, almost to a
pitch of foolishness, through my nerves and brain. This caused me to
feel, not uncomfortable, but rather fearful -LRB-as I am still-RRB- of serious
effects from the incidents of to-day and yesterday. She (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) returned
presently, bringing a smoking basin and a basket of work; and, having
placed the former on the hob, drew in her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) seat, evidently pleased to find
me so companionable.

<p/>Before I came to live here, she (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) commenced--waiting no farther invitation
to her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) story--I was almost always at Wuthering Heights; because my mother
had nursed Mr. Hindley Earnshaw, that was Hareton's father, and I got
used to playing with the children: I ran errands too, and helped to make
hay, and hung about the farm ready for anything that anybody would set me
to. One fine summer morning--it was the beginning of harvest, I
remember--Mr. Earnshaw, the old master, came down-stairs, dressed for a
journey; and, after he (<font color='blue'><b>Earnshaw</b></font>) had told Joseph what was to be done during the
day, he (<font color='blue'><b>Earnshaw</b></font>) turned to Hindley, and Cathy, and me--for I sat eating my
porridge with them--and he (<font color='blue'><b>Earnshaw</b></font>) said, speaking to his (<font color='blue'><b>Earnshaw</b></font>) son, <div class="bookquote">``Now, my bonny man,
I'm going to Liverpool to-day, what shall I bring you? You may choose
what you like: only let it be little, for I shall walk there and back:
sixty miles each way, that is a long spell!''  (<font color='red'><b>son</b></font>)</div>Hindley named a fiddle, and
then he (<font color='blue'><b>Hindley</b></font>) asked Miss Cathy; she (<font color='blue'><b>Cathy</b></font>) was hardly six years old, but she (<font color='blue'><b>Cathy</b></font>) could
ride any horse in the stable, and she (<font color='blue'><b>Cathy</b></font>) chose a whip. He (<font color='blue'><b>Hindley</b></font>) did not forget
me; for he (<font color='blue'><b>Hindley</b></font>) had a kind heart, though he (<font color='blue'><b>Hindley</b></font>) was rather severe sometimes. He (<font color='blue'><b>Hindley</b></font>)
promised to bring me a pocketful of apples and pears, and then he (<font color='blue'><b>Hindley</b></font>) kissed
his (<font color='blue'><b>Hindley</b></font>) children, said good-bye, and set off.

<p/>It seemed a long while to us all--the three days of his (<font color='blue'><b>Hindley</b></font>) absence--and
often did little Cathy ask when he (<font color='blue'><b>Hindley</b></font>) would be home. Mrs. Earnshaw expected
him (<font color='blue'><b>Hindley</b></font>) by supper-time on the third evening, and she (<font color='blue'><b>Earnshaw</b></font>) put the meal off hour
after hour; there were no signs of his (<font color='blue'><b>Hindley</b></font>) coming, however, and at last the
children got tired of running down to the gate to look. Then it grew
dark; she (<font color='blue'><b>Earnshaw</b></font>) would have had them to bed, but they begged sadly to be allowed
to stay up; and, just about eleven o'clock, the door-latch was raised
quietly, and in stepped the master. He (<font color='blue'><b>master</b></font>) threw himself into a chair,
laughing and groaning, and bid them all stand off, for he (<font color='blue'><b>master</b></font>) was nearly
killed--he (<font color='blue'><b>master</b></font>) would not have such another walk for the three kingdoms.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``And at the end of it to be flighted to death!''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>master</b></font>) said, opening his (<font color='blue'><b>master</b></font>)
great-coat, which he (<font color='blue'><b>master</b></font>) held bundled up in his (<font color='blue'><b>master</b></font>) arms. <div class="bookquote">``See here, wife! I
was never so beaten with anything in my life: but you must e`en take it
as a gift of God; though it's as dark almost as if it came from the
devil.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Cathy/Miss Cathy</b></font>)</div><p/>We crowded round, and over Miss Cathy's head I had a peep at a dirty,
ragged, black-haired child; big enough both to walk and talk: indeed, its
face looked older than Catherine's; yet when it was set on its feet, it
only stared round, and repeated over and over again some gibberish that
nobody could understand. I was frightened, and Mrs. Earnshaw was ready
to fling it out of doors: she (<font color='blue'><b>Earnshaw</b></font>) did fly up, asking how he (<font color='blue'><b>master</b></font>) could fashion to
bring that gipsy brat into the house, when they had their own bairns to
feed and fend for? What he (<font color='blue'><b>master</b></font>) meant to do with it, and whether he (<font color='blue'><b>master</b></font>) were mad?
The master tried to explain the matter; but he (<font color='blue'><b>master</b></font>) was really half dead with
fatigue, and all that I could make out, amongst her (<font color='blue'><b>Earnshaw</b></font>) scolding, was a tale
of his (<font color='blue'><b>master</b></font>) seeing it starving, and houseless, and as good as dumb, in the
streets of Liverpool, where he (<font color='blue'><b>master</b></font>) picked it up and inquired for its owner.
Not a soul knew to whom it belonged, he (<font color='blue'><b>master</b></font>) said; and his (<font color='blue'><b>master</b></font>) money and time
being both limited, he (<font color='blue'><b>master</b></font>) thought it better to take it home with him (<font color='blue'><b>master</b></font>) at
once, than run into vain expenses there: because he (<font color='blue'><b>master</b></font>) was determined he (<font color='blue'><b>master</b></font>)
would not leave it as he (<font color='blue'><b>master</b></font>) found it. Well, the conclusion was, that my
mistress grumbled herself calm; and Mr. Earnshaw told me to wash it, and
give it clean things, and let it sleep with the children.

<p/>Hindley and Cathy contented themselves with looking and listening till
peace was restored: then, both began searching their father's pockets
for the presents he (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) had promised them. The former was a boy of fourteen,
but when he (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>) drew out what had been a fiddle, crushed to morsels in the
great-coat, he (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>) blubbered aloud; and Cathy, when she (<font color='blue'><b>Cathy</b></font>) learned the master
had lost her (<font color='blue'><b>Cathy</b></font>) whip in attending on the stranger, showed her (<font color='blue'><b>Cathy</b></font>) humour by
grinning and spitting at the stupid little thing; earning for her (<font color='blue'><b>Cathy</b></font>) pains
a sound blow from her (<font color='blue'><b>Cathy</b></font>) father, to teach her (<font color='blue'><b>Cathy</b></font>) cleaner manners. They
entirely refused to have it in bed with them, or even in their room; and
I had no more sense, so I put it on the landing of the stairs, hoping it
might be gone on the morrow. By chance, or else attracted by hearing his (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>)
voice, it crept to Mr. Earnshaw's door, and there he (<font color='blue'><b>Earnshaw</b></font>) found it on
quitting his (<font color='blue'><b>Earnshaw</b></font>) chamber. Inquiries were made as to how it got there; I was
obliged to confess, and in recompense for my cowardice and inhumanity
was sent out of the house.

<p/>This was Heathcliff's first introduction to the family. On coming back a
few days afterwards -LRB-for I did not consider my banishment perpetual-RRB-, I
found they had christened him (<font color='blue'><b>Heathcliff</b></font>) ``Heathcliff': it was the name of a son who
died in childhood, and it has served him (<font color='blue'><b>son</b></font>) ever since, both for Christian
and surname. Miss Cathy and he (<font color='blue'><b>son</b></font>) were now very thick; but Hindley hated
him (<font color='blue'><b>Hindley</b></font>): and to say the truth I did the same; and we plagued and went on with
him (<font color='blue'><b>Hindley</b></font>) shamefully: for I wasn't reasonable enough to feel my injustice, and
the mistress never put in a word on his (<font color='blue'><b>Hindley</b></font>) behalf when she (<font color='blue'><b>mistress</b></font>) saw him (<font color='blue'><b>Hindley</b></font>) wronged.

<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Hindley</b></font>) seemed a sullen, patient child; hardened, perhaps, to ill-treatment:
he (<font color='blue'><b>Hindley</b></font>) would stand Hindley's blows without winking or shedding a tear, and my
pinches moved him (<font color='blue'><b>Hindley</b></font>) only to draw in a breath and open his (<font color='blue'><b>Hindley</b></font>) eyes, as if he (<font color='blue'><b>Hindley</b></font>)
had hurt himself by accident, and nobody was to blame. This endurance
made old Earnshaw furious, when he (<font color='blue'><b>Earnshaw</b></font>) discovered his (<font color='blue'><b>Earnshaw</b></font>) son persecuting the
poor fatherless child, as he (<font color='blue'><b>Earnshaw</b></font>) called him (<font color='blue'><b>Earnshaw</b></font>). He (<font color='blue'><b>Earnshaw</b></font>) took to Heathcliff
strangely, believing all he (<font color='blue'><b>Heathcliff</b></font>) said -LRB-for that matter, he (<font color='blue'><b>Heathcliff</b></font>) said precious
little, and generally the truth-RRB-, and petting him (<font color='blue'><b>Heathcliff</b></font>) up far above Cathy, who
was too mischievous and wayward for a favourite.

<p/>So, from the very beginning, he (<font color='blue'><b>Heathcliff</b></font>) bred bad feeling in the house; and at
Mrs. Earnshaw's death, which happened in less than two years after, the
young master had learned to regard his (<font color='blue'><b>master</b></font>) father as an oppressor rather than
a friend, and Heathcliff as a usurper of his (<font color='blue'><b>Heathcliff</b></font>) parent's affections and his (<font color='blue'><b>Heathcliff</b></font>)
privileges; and he (<font color='blue'><b>Heathcliff</b></font>) grew bitter with brooding over these injuries. I
sympathised a while; but when the children fell ill of the measles, and I
had to tend them, and take on me the cares of a woman at once, I changed
my idea. Heathcliff was dangerously sick; and while he (<font color='blue'><b>Heathcliff</b></font>) lay at the worst
he (<font color='blue'><b>Heathcliff</b></font>) would have me constantly by his (<font color='blue'><b>Heathcliff</b></font>) pillow: I suppose he (<font color='blue'><b>Heathcliff</b></font>) felt I did a good
deal for him (<font color='blue'><b>Heathcliff</b></font>), and he (<font color='blue'><b>Heathcliff</b></font>) hadn't wit to guess that I was compelled to do it.
However, I will say this, he (<font color='blue'><b>Heathcliff</b></font>) was the quietest child that ever nurse
watched over. The difference between him (<font color='blue'><b>Heathcliff</b></font>) and the others forced me to be
less partial. Cathy and her (<font color='blue'><b>Cathy</b></font>) brother harassed me terribly: he (<font color='blue'><b>brother</b></font>) was as
uncomplaining as a lamb; though hardness, not gentleness, made him (<font color='blue'><b>brother</b></font>) give
little trouble.

<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>brother</b></font>) got through, and the doctor affirmed it was in a great measure owing
to me, and praised me for my care. I was vain of his (<font color='blue'><b>brother</b></font>) commendations, and
softened towards the being by whose means I earned them, and thus Hindley
lost his (<font color='blue'><b>Hindley</b></font>) last ally: still I couldn't dote on Heathcliff, and I wondered
often what my master saw to admire so much in the sullen boy; who never,
to my recollection, repaid his (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>) indulgence by any sign of gratitude. He (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>)
was not insolent to his (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>) benefactor, he (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>) was simply insensible; though
knowing perfectly the hold he (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>) had on his (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>) heart, and conscious he (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>) had only
to speak and all the house would be obliged to bend to his (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>) wishes. As an
instance, I remember Mr. Earnshaw once bought a couple of colts at the
parish fair, and gave the lads each one. Heathcliff took the handsomest,
but it soon fell lame, and when he (<font color='blue'><b>Heathcliff</b></font>) discovered it, he (<font color='blue'><b>Heathcliff</b></font>) said to Hindley--

<p/><div class="bookquote">``You must exchange horses with me: I don't like mine; and if you won't I
shall tell your father of the three thrashings you've given me this week,
and show him (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) my arm, which is black to the shoulder.''  (<font color='red'><b>Hindley/Mr. Hindley</b></font>)</div>Hindley put out
his (<font color='blue'><b>Hindley</b></font>) tongue, and cuffed him (<font color='blue'><b>Hindley</b></font>) over the ears. <div class="bookquote">``You'd better do it at once,''
 (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Hindley</b></font>) persisted, escaping to the porch -LRB-they were in the stable-RRB-: `you will
have to: and if I speak of these blows, you'll get them again with
interest.'' ``Off, dog!'' cried Hindley, threatening him (<font color='blue'><b>Hindley</b></font>) with an iron
weight used for weighing potatoes and hay. ``Throw it,<div class="bookquote">'' he (<font color='blue'><b>Hindley</b></font>) replied,
standing still, `and then I'll tell how you boasted that you would turn
me out of doors as soon as he (<font color='blue'><b>Hindley</b></font>) died, and see whether he (<font color='blue'><b>Hindley</b></font>) will not turn you
out directly.''  (<font color='red'><b>Hindley/Mr. Hindley</b></font>)</div>Hindley threw it, hitting him (<font color='blue'><b>Hindley</b></font>) on the breast, and down he (<font color='blue'><b>Hindley</b></font>)
fell, but staggered up immediately, breathless and white; and, had not I
prevented it, he (<font color='blue'><b>Hindley</b></font>) would have gone just so to the master, and got full
revenge by letting his (<font color='blue'><b>Hindley</b></font>) condition plead for him (<font color='blue'><b>Hindley</b></font>), intimating who had caused
it. <div class="bookquote">``Take my colt, Gipsy, then!''  (<font color='red'><b>Hareton/Hareton Earnshaw/Earnshaw</b></font>)</div>said young Earnshaw. <div class="bookquote">``And I pray that
he (<font color='blue'><b>colt</b></font>) may break your neck: take him (<font color='blue'><b>colt</b></font>), and be damned, you beggarly interloper!
and wheedle my father out of all he (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) has: only afterwards show him (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) what
you are, imp of Satan.--And take that, I hope he (<font color='blue'><b>Satan</b></font>)'ll kick out your
brains!''

 (<font color='red'><b>Heathcliff/Mr. Heathcliff</b></font>)</div><p/>Heathcliff had gone to loose the beast, and shift it to his (<font color='blue'><b>Heathcliff</b></font>) own stall; he (<font color='blue'><b>Heathcliff</b></font>)
was passing behind it, when Hindley finished his (<font color='blue'><b>Hindley</b></font>) speech by knocking him (<font color='blue'><b>Hindley</b></font>)
under its feet, and without stopping to examine whether his (<font color='blue'><b>Hindley</b></font>) hopes were
fulfilled, ran away as fast as he (<font color='blue'><b>Hindley</b></font>) could. I was surprised to witness how
coolly the child gathered himself up, and went on with his (<font color='blue'><b>Hindley</b></font>) intention;
exchanging saddles and all, and then sitting down on a bundle of hay to
overcome the qualm which the violent blow occasioned, before he (<font color='blue'><b>Hindley</b></font>) entered
the house. I persuaded him (<font color='blue'><b>Hindley</b></font>) easily to let me lay the blame of his (<font color='blue'><b>Hindley</b></font>) bruises
on the horse: he (<font color='blue'><b>Hindley</b></font>) minded little what tale was told since he (<font color='blue'><b>Hindley</b></font>) had what he (<font color='blue'><b>Hindley</b></font>)
wanted. He (<font color='blue'><b>Hindley</b></font>) complained so seldom, indeed, of such stirs as these, that I
really thought him (<font color='blue'><b>Hindley</b></font>) not vindictive: I was deceived completely, as you will
hear.




<p/>CHAPTER V


<p/>In the course of time Mr. Earnshaw began to fail. He (<font color='blue'><b>Earnshaw</b></font>) had been active and
healthy, yet his (<font color='blue'><b>Earnshaw</b></font>) strength left him (<font color='blue'><b>Earnshaw</b></font>) suddenly; and when he (<font color='blue'><b>Earnshaw</b></font>) was confined to
the chimney-corner he (<font color='blue'><b>Earnshaw</b></font>) grew grievously irritable. A nothing vexed him (<font color='blue'><b>Earnshaw</b></font>);
and suspected slights of his (<font color='blue'><b>Earnshaw</b></font>) authority nearly threw him (<font color='blue'><b>Earnshaw</b></font>) into fits. This
was especially to be remarked if any one attempted to impose upon, or
domineer over, his (<font color='blue'><b>Earnshaw</b></font>) favourite: he (<font color='blue'><b>Earnshaw</b></font>) was painfully jealous lest a word
should be spoken amiss to him (<font color='blue'><b>Earnshaw</b></font>); seeming to have got into his (<font color='blue'><b>Earnshaw</b></font>) head the
notion that, because he (<font color='blue'><b>Earnshaw</b></font>) liked Heathcliff, all hated, and longed to do
him (<font color='blue'><b>Earnshaw</b></font>) an ill-turn. It was a disadvantage to the lad; for the kinder among
us did not wish to fret the master, so we humoured his (<font color='blue'><b>master</b></font>) partiality; and
that humouring was rich nourishment to the child's pride and black
tempers. Still it became in a manner necessary; twice, or thrice,
Hindley's manifestation of scorn, while his (<font color='blue'><b>Hindley</b></font>) father was near, roused the
old man to a fury: he (<font color='blue'><b>Hindley</b></font>) seized his (<font color='blue'><b>Hindley</b></font>) stick to strike him (<font color='blue'><b>Hindley</b></font>), and shook with
rage that he (<font color='blue'><b>Hindley</b></font>) could not do it.

<p/>At last, our curate -LRB-we had a curate then who made the living answer by
teaching the little Lintons and Earnshaws, and farming his (<font color='blue'><b>Hindley</b></font>) bit of land
himself-RRB- advised that the young man should be sent to college; and Mr.
Earnshaw agreed, though with a heavy spirit, for he (<font color='blue'><b>Earnshaw</b></font>) said--<div class="bookquote">``Hindley was
nought, and would never thrive as where he (<font color='blue'><b>Hindley</b></font>) wandered.''

 (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div><p/>I hoped heartily we should have peace now. It hurt me to think the
master should be made uncomfortable by his (<font color='blue'><b>master</b></font>) own good deed. I fancied the
discontent of age and disease arose from his (<font color='blue'><b>master</b></font>) family disagreements; as he (<font color='blue'><b>master</b></font>)
would have it that it did: really, you know, sir, it was in his (<font color='blue'><b>master</b></font>) sinking
frame. We might have got on tolerably, notwithstanding, but for two
people--Miss Cathy, and Joseph, the servant: you saw him (<font color='blue'><b>Joseph</b></font>), I daresay, up
yonder. He (<font color='blue'><b>Joseph</b></font>) was, and is yet most likely, the wearisomest self-righteous
Pharisee that ever ransacked a Bible to rake the promises to himself and
fling the curses to his (<font color='blue'><b>Joseph</b></font>) neighbours. By his (<font color='blue'><b>Joseph</b></font>) knack of sermonising and
pious discoursing, he (<font color='blue'><b>Joseph</b></font>) contrived to make a great impression on Mr.
Earnshaw; and the more feeble the master became, the more influence he (<font color='blue'><b>master</b></font>)
gained. He (<font color='blue'><b>master</b></font>) was relentless in worrying him (<font color='blue'><b>master</b></font>) about his (<font color='blue'><b>master</b></font>) soul's concerns, and
about ruling his (<font color='blue'><b>master</b></font>) children rigidly. He (<font color='blue'><b>master</b></font>) encouraged him (<font color='blue'><b>master</b></font>) to regard Hindley
as a reprobate; and, night after night, he (<font color='blue'><b>master</b></font>) regularly grumbled out a long
string of tales against Heathcliff and Catherine: always minding to
flatter Earnshaw's weakness by heaping the heaviest blame on the latter.

<p/>Certainly she (<font color='blue'><b>Catherine</b></font>) had ways with her (<font color='blue'><b>Catherine</b></font>) such as I never saw a child take up
before; and she (<font color='blue'><b>Catherine</b></font>) put all of us past our patience fifty times and oftener
in a day: from the hour she (<font color='blue'><b>Catherine</b></font>) came down-stairs till the hour she (<font color='blue'><b>Catherine</b></font>) went to
bed, we had not a minute's security that she (<font color='blue'><b>Catherine</b></font>) wouldn't be in mischief. Her (<font color='blue'><b>Catherine</b></font>)
spirits were always at high-water mark, her (<font color='blue'><b>Catherine</b></font>) tongue always going--singing,
laughing, and plaguing everybody who would not do the same. A wild,
wicked slip she (<font color='blue'><b>Catherine</b></font>) was--but she (<font color='blue'><b>Catherine</b></font>) had the bonniest eye, the sweetest smile,
and lightest foot in the parish: and, after all, I believe she (<font color='blue'><b>Catherine</b></font>) meant no
harm; for when once she (<font color='blue'><b>Catherine</b></font>) made you cry in good earnest, it seldom happened
that she (<font color='blue'><b>Catherine</b></font>) would not keep you company, and oblige you to be quiet that you
might comfort her (<font color='blue'><b>Catherine</b></font>). She (<font color='blue'><b>Catherine</b></font>) was much too fond of Heathcliff. The greatest
punishment we could invent for her (<font color='blue'><b>Catherine</b></font>) was to keep her (<font color='blue'><b>Catherine</b></font>) separate from him (<font color='blue'><b>Heathcliff</b></font>): yet
she (<font color='blue'><b>Catherine</b></font>) got chided more than any of us on his (<font color='blue'><b>Heathcliff</b></font>) account. In play, she (<font color='blue'><b>Catherine</b></font>) liked
exceedingly to act the little mistress; using her (<font color='blue'><b>Catherine</b></font>) hands freely, and
commanding her (<font color='blue'><b>Catherine</b></font>) companions: she (<font color='blue'><b>Catherine</b></font>) did so to me, but I would not bear
slapping and ordering; and so I let her (<font color='blue'><b>Catherine</b></font>) know.

<p/>Now, Mr. Earnshaw did not understand jokes from his (<font color='blue'><b>Earnshaw</b></font>) children: he (<font color='blue'><b>Earnshaw</b></font>) had
always been strict and grave with them; and Catherine, on her (<font color='blue'><b>Catherine</b></font>) part, had
no idea why her (<font color='blue'><b>Catherine</b></font>) father should be crosser and less patient in his (<font color='blue'><b>patient</b></font>) ailing
condition than he (<font color='blue'><b>patient</b></font>) was in his (<font color='blue'><b>patient</b></font>) prime. His (<font color='blue'><b>patient</b></font>) peevish reproofs wakened in her (<font color='blue'><b>Catherine</b></font>)
a naughty delight to provoke him (<font color='blue'><b>patient</b></font>): she (<font color='blue'><b>Catherine</b></font>) was never so happy as when we were
all scolding her (<font color='blue'><b>Catherine</b></font>) at once, and she (<font color='blue'><b>Catherine</b></font>) defying us with her (<font color='blue'><b>Catherine</b></font>) bold, saucy look,
and her (<font color='blue'><b>Catherine</b></font>) ready words; turning Joseph's religious curses into ridicule,
baiting me, and doing just what her (<font color='blue'><b>Catherine</b></font>) father hated most--showing how her (<font color='blue'><b>Catherine</b></font>)
pretended insolence, which he (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) thought real, had more power over
Heathcliff than his (<font color='blue'><b>Heathcliff</b></font>) kindness: how the boy would do _her (<font color='blue'><b>Catherine</b></font>)_ bidding in
anything, and _his (<font color='blue'><b>Heathcliff</b></font>)_ only when it suited his (<font color='blue'><b>Heathcliff</b></font>) own inclination. After
behaving as badly as possible all day, she (<font color='blue'><b>Catherine</b></font>) sometimes came fondling to
make it up at night. <div class="bookquote">``Nay, Cathy,''  (<font color='red'><b>the man</b></font>)</div>the old man would say, <div class="bookquote">``I cannot love
thee, thou`rt worse than thy brother. Go, say thy prayers, child, and
ask God's pardon. I doubt thy mother and I must rue that we ever reared
thee!''  (<font color='red'><b>the man</b></font>)</div>That made her (<font color='blue'><b>Catherine</b></font>) cry, at first; and then being repulsed continually
hardened her (<font color='blue'><b>Catherine</b></font>), and she (<font color='blue'><b>Catherine</b></font>) laughed if I told her (<font color='blue'><b>Catherine</b></font>) to say she (<font color='blue'><b>Catherine</b></font>) was sorry for her (<font color='blue'><b>Catherine</b></font>)
faults, and beg to be forgiven.

<p/>But the hour came, at last, that ended Mr. Earnshaw's troubles on earth.
He (<font color='blue'><b>Earnshaw</b></font>) died quietly in his (<font color='blue'><b>Earnshaw</b></font>) chair one October evening, seated by the
fire-side. A high wind blustered round the house, and roared in the
chimney: it sounded wild and stormy, yet it was not cold, and we were all
together--I, a little removed from the hearth, busy at my knitting, and
Joseph reading his (<font color='blue'><b>Joseph</b></font>) Bible near the table -LRB-for the servants generally sat
in the house then, after their work was done-RRB-. Miss Cathy had been sick,
and that made her (<font color='blue'><b>Cathy</b></font>) still; she (<font color='blue'><b>Cathy</b></font>) leant against her (<font color='blue'><b>Cathy</b></font>) father's knee, and
Heathcliff was lying on the floor with his (<font color='blue'><b>Heathcliff</b></font>) head in her (<font color='blue'><b>Cathy</b></font>) lap. I remember
the master, before he (<font color='blue'><b>Heathcliff</b></font>) fell into a doze, stroking her (<font color='blue'><b>Cathy</b></font>) bonny hair--it
pleased him (<font color='blue'><b>Heathcliff</b></font>) rarely to see her (<font color='blue'><b>Cathy</b></font>) gentle--and saying, <div class="bookquote">``Why canst thou not
always be a good lass, Cathy?''  (<font color='red'><b>him</b></font>)</div>And she (<font color='blue'><b>Cathy</b></font>) turned her (<font color='blue'><b>Cathy</b></font>) face up to his (<font color='blue'><b>Heathcliff</b></font>), and
laughed, and answered, <div class="bookquote">``Why cannot you always be a good man, father?''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>But
as soon as she (<font color='blue'><b>Cathy</b></font>) saw him (<font color='blue'><b>Heathcliff</b></font>) vexed again, she (<font color='blue'><b>Cathy</b></font>) kissed his (<font color='blue'><b>Heathcliff</b></font>) hand, and said she (<font color='blue'><b>Cathy</b></font>)
would sing him (<font color='blue'><b>Heathcliff</b></font>) to sleep. She (<font color='blue'><b>Cathy</b></font>) began singing very low, till his (<font color='blue'><b>Heathcliff</b></font>) fingers
dropped from hers, and his (<font color='blue'><b>Heathcliff</b></font>) head sank on his (<font color='blue'><b>Heathcliff</b></font>) breast. Then I told her (<font color='blue'><b>Cathy</b></font>) to
hush, and not stir, for fear she (<font color='blue'><b>Cathy</b></font>) should wake him (<font color='blue'><b>Heathcliff</b></font>). We all kept as mute as
mice a full half-hour, and should have done so longer, only Joseph,
having finished his (<font color='blue'><b>Joseph</b></font>) chapter, got up and said that he (<font color='blue'><b>Joseph</b></font>) must rouse the
master for prayers and bed. He (<font color='blue'><b>Joseph</b></font>) stepped forward, and called him (<font color='blue'><b>Joseph</b></font>) by name,
and touched his (<font color='blue'><b>Joseph</b></font>) shoulder; but he (<font color='blue'><b>Joseph</b></font>) would not move: so he (<font color='blue'><b>Joseph</b></font>) took the candle
and looked at him (<font color='blue'><b>Joseph</b></font>). I thought there was something wrong as he (<font color='blue'><b>Joseph</b></font>) set down
the light; and seizing the children each by an arm, whispered them to
`frame up-stairs, and make little din--they might pray alone that
evening--he (<font color='blue'><b>Joseph</b></font>) had summut to do.''

<p/><div class="bookquote">``I shall bid father good-night first,''  (<font color='red'><b>Catherine/Earnshaw/Catherine Earnshaw</b></font>)</div>said Catherine, putting her (<font color='blue'><b>Catherine</b></font>) arms
round his (<font color='blue'><b>Joseph</b></font>) neck, before we could hinder her (<font color='blue'><b>Catherine</b></font>). The poor thing discovered
her (<font color='blue'><b>Catherine</b></font>) loss directly--she (<font color='blue'><b>Catherine</b></font>) screamed out--<div class="bookquote">``Oh, he (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>)'s dead, Heathcliff! he (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>)'s
dead!''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>And they both set up a heart-breaking cry.

<p/>I joined my wail to theirs, loud and bitter; but Joseph asked what we
could be thinking of to roar in that way over a saint in heaven. He (<font color='blue'><b>Joseph</b></font>) told
me to put on my cloak and run to Gimmerton for the doctor and the parson.
I could not guess the use that either would be of, then. However, I
went, through wind and rain, and brought one, the doctor, back with me;
the other said he (<font color='blue'><b>doctor</b></font>) would come in the morning. Leaving Joseph to explain
matters, I ran to the children's room: their door was ajar, I saw they
had never lain down, though it was past midnight; but they were calmer,
and did not need me to console them. The little souls were comforting
each other with better thoughts than I could have hit on: no parson in
the world ever pictured heaven so beautifully as they did, in their
innocent talk; and, while I sobbed and listened, I could not help wishing
we were all there safe together.




<p/>CHAPTER VI


<p/>Mr. Hindley came home to the funeral; and--a thing that amazed us, and
set the neighbours gossiping right and left--he (<font color='blue'><b>Hindley</b></font>) brought a wife with him (<font color='blue'><b>Hindley</b></font>).
What she (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>) was, and where she (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>) was born, he (<font color='blue'><b>Hindley</b></font>) never informed us: probably, she (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>)
had neither money nor name to recommend her (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>), or he (<font color='blue'><b>Hindley</b></font>) would scarcely have
kept the union from his (<font color='blue'><b>Hindley</b></font>) father.

<p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>) was not one that would have disturbed the house much on her (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>) own
account. Every object she (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>) saw, the moment she (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>) crossed the threshold,
appeared to delight her (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>); and every circumstance that took place about
her (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>): except the preparing for the burial, and the presence of the
mourners. I thought she (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>) was half silly, from her (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>) behaviour while that
went on: she (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>) ran into her (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>) chamber, and made me come with her (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>), though I
should have been dressing the children: and there she (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>) sat shivering and
clasping her (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>) hands, and asking repeatedly--<div class="bookquote">``Are they gone yet?''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>Then she (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>)
began describing with hysterical emotion the effect it produced on her (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>) to
see black; and started, and trembled, and, at last, fell a-weeping--and
when I asked what was the matter, answered, she (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>) didn't know; but she (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>) felt
so afraid of dying! I imagined her (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>) as little likely to die as myself.
She (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>) was rather thin, but young, and fresh-complexioned, and her (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>) eyes
sparkled as bright as diamonds. I did remark, to be sure, that mounting
the stairs made her (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>) breathe very quick; that the least sudden noise set
her (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>) all in a quiver, and that she (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>) coughed troublesomely sometimes: but I
knew nothing of what these symptoms portended, and had no impulse to
sympathise with her (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>). We don't in general take to foreigners here, Mr.
Lockwood, unless they take to us first.

<p/>Young Earnshaw was altered considerably in the three years of his (<font color='blue'><b>Earnshaw</b></font>)
absence. He (<font color='blue'><b>Earnshaw</b></font>) had grown sparer, and lost his (<font color='blue'><b>Earnshaw</b></font>) colour, and spoke and dressed
quite differently; and, on the very day of his (<font color='blue'><b>Earnshaw</b></font>) return, he (<font color='blue'><b>Earnshaw</b></font>) told Joseph
and me we must thenceforth quarter ourselves in the back-kitchen, and
leave the house for him (<font color='blue'><b>Earnshaw</b></font>). Indeed, he (<font color='blue'><b>Earnshaw</b></font>) would have carpeted and papered a
small spare room for a parlour; but his (<font color='blue'><b>Earnshaw</b></font>) wife expressed such pleasure at
the white floor and huge glowing fireplace, at the pewter dishes and
delf-case, and dog-kennel, and the wide space there was to move about in
where they usually sat, that he (<font color='blue'><b>Earnshaw</b></font>) thought it unnecessary to her (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>) comfort,
and so dropped the intention.

<p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>) expressed pleasure, too, at finding a sister among her (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>) new
acquaintance; and she (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>) prattled to Catherine, and kissed her (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>), and ran
about with her (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>), and gave her (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>) quantities of presents, at the beginning.
Her (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>) affection tired very soon, however, and when she (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>) grew peevish,
Hindley became tyrannical. A few words from her (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>), evincing a dislike to
Heathcliff, were enough to rouse in him (<font color='blue'><b>Heathcliff</b></font>) all his (<font color='blue'><b>Heathcliff</b></font>) old hatred of the boy. He (<font color='blue'><b>Heathcliff</b></font>)
drove him (<font color='blue'><b>Heathcliff</b></font>) from their company to the servants, deprived him (<font color='blue'><b>Heathcliff</b></font>) of the
instructions of the curate, and insisted that he (<font color='blue'><b>Heathcliff</b></font>) should labour out of
doors instead; compelling him (<font color='blue'><b>Heathcliff</b></font>) to do so as hard as any other lad on the
farm.

<p/>Heathcliff bore his (<font color='blue'><b>Heathcliff</b></font>) degradation pretty well at first, because Cathy
taught him (<font color='blue'><b>Heathcliff</b></font>) what she (<font color='blue'><b>Cathy</b></font>) learnt, and worked or played with him (<font color='blue'><b>Heathcliff</b></font>) in the fields.
They both promised fair to grow up as rude as savages; the young master
being entirely negligent how they behaved, and what they did, so they
kept clear of him (<font color='blue'><b>master</b></font>). He (<font color='blue'><b>master</b></font>) would not even have seen after their going to
church on Sundays, only Joseph and the curate reprimanded his (<font color='blue'><b>Joseph</b></font>)
carelessness when they absented themselves; and that reminded him (<font color='blue'><b>Joseph</b></font>) to
order Heathcliff a flogging, and Catherine a fast from dinner or supper.
But it was one of their chief amusements to run away to the moors in the
morning and remain there all day, and the after punishment grew a mere
thing to laugh at. The curate might set as many chapters as he (<font color='blue'><b>Heathcliff</b></font>) pleased
for Catherine to get by heart, and Joseph might thrash Heathcliff till
his (<font color='blue'><b>Joseph</b></font>) arm ached; they forgot everything the minute they were together
again: at least the minute they had contrived some naughty plan of
revenge; and many a time I've cried to myself to watch them growing more
reckless daily, and I not daring to speak a syllable, for fear of losing
the small power I still retained over the unfriended creatures. One
Sunday evening, it chanced that they were banished from the sitting-room,
for making a noise, or a light offence of the kind; and when I went to
call them to supper, I could discover them nowhere. We searched the
house, above and below, and the yard and stables; they were invisible:
and, at last, Hindley in a passion told us to bolt the doors, and swore
nobody should let them in that night. The household went to bed; and I,
too, anxious to lie down, opened my lattice and put my head out to
hearken, though it rained: determined to admit them in spite of the
prohibition, should they return. In a while, I distinguished steps
coming up the road, and the light of a lantern glimmered through the
gate. I threw a shawl over my head and ran to prevent them from waking
Mr. Earnshaw by knocking. There was Heathcliff, by himself: it gave me a
start to see him (<font color='blue'><b>Heathcliff</b></font>) alone.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Where is Miss Catherine?''  (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div>I cried hurriedly. <div class="bookquote">``No accident, I hope?''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``At
Thrushcross Grange,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Heathcliff</b></font>) answered; `and I would have been there too, but
they had not the manners to ask me to stay.'' ``Well, you will catch it!<div class="bookquote">''
I said: `you'll never be content till you're sent about your business.
What in the world led you wandering to Thrushcross Grange?''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``Let me get
off my wet clothes, and I'll tell you all about it, Nelly,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Heathcliff</b></font>) replied.
I bid him (<font color='blue'><b>Heathcliff</b></font>) beware of rousing the master, and while he (<font color='blue'><b>Heathcliff</b></font>) undressed and I
waited to put out the candle, he (<font color='blue'><b>Heathcliff</b></font>) continued--<div class="bookquote">``Cathy and I escaped from
the wash-house to have a ramble at liberty, and getting a glimpse of the
Grange lights, we thought we would just go and see whether the Lintons
passed their Sunday evenings standing shivering in corners, while their
father and mother sat eating and drinking, and singing and laughing, and
burning their eyes out before the fire. Do you think they do? Or reading
sermons, and being catechised by their manservant, and set to learn a
column of Scripture names, if they don't answer properly?''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``Probably
not,''  (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div>I responded. <div class="bookquote">``They are good children, no doubt, and don't deserve
the treatment you receive, for your bad conduct.''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``Don't cant, Nelly,''
 (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Heathcliff</b></font>) said: `nonsense! We ran from the top of the Heights to the park,
without stopping--Catherine completely beaten in the race, because she (<font color='blue'><b>Catherine</b></font>)
was barefoot. You'll have to seek for her (<font color='blue'><b>Catherine</b></font>) shoes in the bog to-morrow. We
crept through a broken hedge, groped our way up the path, and planted
ourselves on a flower-plot under the drawing-room window. The light came
from thence; they had not put up the shutters, and the curtains were
only half closed. Both of us were able to look in by standing on the
basement, and clinging to the ledge, and we saw--ah! it was beautiful--a
splendid place carpeted with crimson, and crimson-covered chairs and
tables, and a pure white ceiling bordered by gold, a shower of
glass-drops hanging in silver chains from the centre, and shimmering
with little soft tapers. Old Mr. and Mrs. Linton were not there; Edgar
and his (<font color='blue'><b>Edgar</b></font>) sisters had it entirely to themselves. Shouldn't they have been
happy? We should have thought ourselves in heaven! And now, guess what
your good children were doing? Isabella--I believe she (<font color='blue'><b>Isabella</b></font>) is eleven, a year
younger than Cathy--lay screaming at the farther end of the room,
shrieking as if witches were running red-hot needles into her (<font color='blue'><b>Cathy</b></font>). Edgar
stood on the hearth weeping silently, and in the middle of the table sat
a little dog, shaking its paw and yelping; which, from their mutual
accusations, we understood they had nearly pulled in two between them.
The idiots! That was their pleasure! to quarrel who should hold a heap
of warm hair, and each begin to cry because both, after struggling to
get it, refused to take it. We laughed outright at the petted things; we
did despise them! When would you catch me wishing to have what Catherine
wanted? or find us by ourselves, seeking entertainment in yelling, and
sobbing, and rolling on the ground, divided by the whole room? I'd not
exchange, for a thousand lives, my condition here, for Edgar Linton's at
Thrushcross Grange--not if I might have the privilege of flinging Joseph
off the highest gable, and painting the house-front with Hindley's
blood!''

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Hush, hush!''  (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div>I interrupted. <div class="bookquote">``Still you have not told me, Heathcliff,
how Catherine is left behind?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I told you we laughed,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Hindley</b></font>) answered. ``The Lintons heard us, and with
one accord they shot like arrows to the door; there was silence, and
then a cry, ``Oh, mamma, mamma! Oh, papa! Oh, mamma, come here. Oh, papa,
oh!'' They really did howl out something in that way. We made frightful
noises to terrify them still more, and then we dropped off the ledge,
because somebody was drawing the bars, and we felt we had better flee. I
had Cathy by the hand, and was urging her (<font color='blue'><b>Cathy</b></font>) on, when all at once she (<font color='blue'><b>Cathy</b></font>) fell
down. ``Run, Heathcliff, run!'' she (<font color='blue'><b>Cathy</b></font>) whispered. ``They have let the bull-dog
loose, and he (<font color='blue'><b>Heathcliff</b></font>) holds me!'' The devil had seized her (<font color='blue'><b>Cathy</b></font>) ankle, Nelly: I heard
his (<font color='blue'><b>Nelly</b></font>) abominable snorting. She (<font color='blue'><b>Cathy</b></font>) did not yell out--no! she (<font color='blue'><b>Cathy</b></font>) would have
scorned to do it, if she (<font color='blue'><b>Cathy</b></font>) had been spitted on the horns of a mad cow. I
did, though: I vociferated curses enough to annihilate any fiend in
Christendom; and I got a stone and thrust it between his (<font color='blue'><b>fiend</b></font>) jaws, and tried
with all my might to cram it down his (<font color='blue'><b>fiend</b></font>) throat. A beast of a servant came
up with a lantern, at last, shouting--``Keep fast, Skulker, keep fast!''
He (<font color='blue'><b>fiend</b></font>) changed his (<font color='blue'><b>fiend</b></font>) note, however, when he (<font color='blue'><b>fiend</b></font>) saw Skulker's game. The dog was
throttled off; his (<font color='blue'><b>fiend</b></font>) huge, purple tongue hanging half a foot out of his (<font color='blue'><b>fiend</b></font>)
mouth, and his (<font color='blue'><b>fiend</b></font>) pendent lips streaming with bloody slaver. The man took
Cathy up; she (<font color='blue'><b>Cathy</b></font>) was sick: not from fear, I'm certain, but from pain. He (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>)
carried her (<font color='blue'><b>Cathy</b></font>) in; I followed, grumbling execrations and vengeance. ``What
prey, Robert?'' hallooed Linton from the entrance. ``Skulker has caught a
little girl, sir,'' he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) replied; ``and there's a lad here,'' he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) added,
making a clutch at me, ``who looks an out-and-outer! Very like the
robbers were for putting them through the window to open the doors to
the gang after all were asleep, that they might murder us at their ease.
Hold your tongue, you foul-mouthed thief, you! you shall go to the
gallows for this. Mr. Linton, sir, don't lay by your gun.'' ``No, no,
Robert,'' said the old fool. ``The rascals knew that yesterday was my
rent-day: they thought to have me cleverly. Come in; I'll furnish them a
reception. There, John, fasten the chain. Give Skulker some water,
Jenny. To beard a magistrate in his (<font color='blue'><b>John</b></font>) stronghold, and on the Sabbath, too!
Where will their insolence stop? Oh, my dear Mary, look here! Don't be
afraid, it is but a boy--yet the villain scowls so plainly in his (<font color='blue'><b>villain</b></font>) face;
would it not be a kindness to the country to hang him (<font color='blue'><b>villain</b></font>) at once, before he (<font color='blue'><b>villain</b></font>)
shows his (<font color='blue'><b>villain</b></font>) nature in acts as well as features?'' He (<font color='blue'><b>fool</b></font>) pulled me under the
chandelier, and Mrs. Linton placed her (<font color='blue'><b>Linton</b></font>) spectacles on her (<font color='blue'><b>Linton</b></font>) nose and raised
her (<font color='blue'><b>Linton</b></font>) hands in horror. The cowardly children crept nearer also, Isabella
lisping--<div class="bookquote">``Frightful thing! Put him (<font color='blue'><b>villain</b></font>) in the cellar, papa. He (<font color='blue'><b>villain</b></font>)'s exactly
like the son of the fortune-teller that stole my tame pheasant. Isn't
he (<font color='blue'><b>villain</b></font>), Edgar?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/>``While they examined me, Cathy came round; she (<font color='blue'><b>Cathy</b></font>) heard the last speech, and
laughed. Edgar Linton, after an inquisitive stare, collected sufficient
wit to recognise her (<font color='blue'><b>Cathy</b></font>). They see us at church, you know, though we seldom
meet them elsewhere. ``That's Miss Earnshaw?'' he (<font color='blue'><b>fool</b></font>) whispered to his (<font color='blue'><b>fool</b></font>) mother,
<div class="bookquote">``and look how Skulker has bitten her (<font color='blue'><b>Cathy</b></font>)--how her (<font color='blue'><b>Cathy</b></font>) foot bleeds!''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/>'<div class="bookquote">``Miss Earnshaw? Nonsense!''  (<font color='red'><b>the dame</b></font>)</div>cried the dame; <div class="bookquote">``Miss Earnshaw scouring the
country with a gipsy! And yet, my dear, the child is in mourning--surely
it is--and she (<font color='blue'><b>Earnshaw</b></font>) may be lamed for life!''

 (<font color='red'><b>the dame</b></font>)</div><p/>'<div class="bookquote">``What culpable carelessness in her (<font color='blue'><b>Earnshaw</b></font>) brother!''  (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Linton</b></font>)</div>exclaimed Mr. Linton,
turning from me to Catherine. <div class="bookquote">``I've understood from Shielders'' (<font color='red'><b>the curate</b></font>)</div>' -LRB-that
was the curate, sir-RRB- '<div class="bookquote">``that he (<font color='blue'><b>brother</b></font>) lets her (<font color='blue'><b>Earnshaw</b></font>) grow up in absolute heathenism.
But who is this? Where did she (<font color='blue'><b>Earnshaw</b></font>) pick up this companion? Oho! I declare
he (<font color='blue'><b>companion</b></font>) is that strange acquisition my late neighbour made, in his (<font color='blue'><b>companion</b></font>) journey to
Liverpool--a little Lascar, or an American or Spanish castaway.''

 (<font color='red'><b>the curate</b></font>)</div><p/>'<div class="bookquote">``A wicked boy, at all events,''  (<font color='red'><b>boy the lady</b></font>)</div>remarked the old lady, <div class="bookquote">``and quite unfit
for a decent house! Did you notice his (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>) language, Linton? I'm shocked
that my children should have heard it.''

 (<font color='red'><b>boy the lady</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I recommenced cursing--don't be angry, Nelly--and so Robert was ordered
to take me off. I refused to go without Cathy; he (<font color='blue'><b>Robert</b></font>) dragged me into the
garden, pushed the lantern into my hand, assured me that Mr. Earnshaw
should be informed of my behaviour, and, bidding me march directly,
secured the door again. The curtains were still looped up at one corner,
and I resumed my station as spy; because, if Catherine had wished to
return, I intended shattering their great glass panes to a million of
fragments, unless they let her (<font color='blue'><b>Catherine</b></font>) out. She (<font color='blue'><b>Catherine</b></font>) sat on the sofa quietly. Mrs.
Linton took off the grey cloak of the dairy-maid which we had borrowed
for our excursion, shaking her (<font color='blue'><b>Linton</b></font>) head and expostulating with her (<font color='blue'><b>Linton</b></font>), I
suppose: she (<font color='blue'><b>Linton</b></font>) was a young lady, and they made a distinction between her (<font color='blue'><b>Linton</b></font>)
treatment and mine. Then the woman-servant brought a basin of warm
water, and washed her (<font color='blue'><b>Linton</b></font>) feet; and Mr. Linton mixed a tumbler of negus, and
Isabella emptied a plateful of cakes into her (<font color='blue'><b>Isabella</b></font>) lap, and Edgar stood gaping
at a distance. Afterwards, they dried and combed her (<font color='blue'><b>Isabella</b></font>) beautiful hair, and
gave her (<font color='blue'><b>Isabella</b></font>) a pair of enormous slippers, and wheeled her (<font color='blue'><b>Isabella</b></font>) to the fire; and I
left her (<font color='blue'><b>Isabella</b></font>), as merry as she (<font color='blue'><b>Isabella</b></font>) could be, dividing her (<font color='blue'><b>Isabella</b></font>) food between the little
dog and Skulker, whose nose she (<font color='blue'><b>Isabella</b></font>) pinched as he (<font color='blue'><b>Edgar</b></font>) ate; and kindling a spark
of spirit in the vacant blue eyes of the Lintons--a dim reflection from
her (<font color='blue'><b>Isabella</b></font>) own enchanting face. I saw they were full of stupid admiration; she (<font color='blue'><b>Isabella</b></font>)
is so immeasurably superior to them--to everybody on earth, is she (<font color='blue'><b>Isabella</b></font>) not,
Nelly?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``There will more come of this business than you reckon on,''  (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div>I answered,
covering him (<font color='blue'><b>Linton</b></font>) up and extinguishing the light. ``You are incurable,
Heathcliff; and Mr. Hindley will have to proceed to extremities, see if
he (<font color='blue'><b>Hindley</b></font>) won<div class="bookquote">``t.''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>My words came truer than I desired. The luckless adventure
made Earnshaw furious. And then Mr. Linton, to mend matters, paid us a
visit himself on the morrow, and read the young master such a lecture on
the road he (<font color='blue'><b>master</b></font>) guided his (<font color='blue'><b>master</b></font>) family, that he (<font color='blue'><b>master</b></font>) was stirred to look about him (<font color='blue'><b>master</b></font>), in
earnest. Heathcliff received no flogging, but he (<font color='blue'><b>Heathcliff</b></font>) was told that the first
word he (<font color='blue'><b>Heathcliff</b></font>) spoke to Miss Catherine should ensure a dismissal; and Mrs.
Earnshaw undertook to keep her (<font color='blue'><b>Earnshaw</b></font>) sister-in-law in due restraint when she (<font color='blue'><b>Earnshaw</b></font>)
returned home; employing art, not force: with force she (<font color='blue'><b>Earnshaw</b></font>) would have found
it impossible.




<p/>CHAPTER VII


<p/>Cathy stayed at Thrushcross Grange five weeks: till Christmas. By that
time her (<font color='blue'><b>Cathy</b></font>) ankle was thoroughly cured, and her (<font color='blue'><b>Cathy</b></font>) manners much improved. The
mistress visited her (<font color='blue'><b>Cathy</b></font>) often in the interval, and commenced her (<font color='blue'><b>Cathy</b></font>) plan of
reform by trying to raise her (<font color='blue'><b>Cathy</b></font>) self-respect with fine clothes and
flattery, which she (<font color='blue'><b>Cathy</b></font>) took readily; so that, instead of a wild, hatless
little savage jumping into the house, and rushing to squeeze us all
breathless, there `lighted from a handsome black pony a very dignified
person, with brown ringlets falling from the cover of a feathered beaver,
and a long cloth habit, which she (<font color='blue'><b>Cathy</b></font>) was obliged to hold up with both hands
that she (<font color='blue'><b>Cathy</b></font>) might sail in. Hindley lifted her (<font color='blue'><b>Cathy</b></font>) from her (<font color='blue'><b>Cathy</b></font>) horse, exclaiming
delightedly, <div class="bookquote">``Why, Cathy, you are quite a beauty! I should scarcely have
known you: you look like a lady now. Isabella Linton is not to be
compared with her (<font color='blue'><b>Linton</b></font>), is she (<font color='blue'><b>Linton</b></font>), Frances?''  (<font color='red'><b>Hindley/Mr. Hindley</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``Isabella has not her (<font color='blue'><b>Isabella</b></font>) natural
advantages,''  (<font color='red'><b>advantages wife</b></font>)</div>replied his (<font color='blue'><b>Hindley</b></font>) wife: `but she (<font color='blue'><b>Cathy</b></font>) must mind and not grow wild again
here. Ellen, help Miss Catherine off with her (<font color='blue'><b>Catherine</b></font>) things--Stay, dear, you
will disarrange your curls--let me untie your hat.''

<p/>I removed the habit, and there shone forth beneath a grand plaid silk
frock, white trousers, and burnished shoes; and, while her (<font color='blue'><b>Catherine</b></font>) eyes sparkled
joyfully when the dogs came bounding up to welcome her (<font color='blue'><b>Catherine</b></font>), she (<font color='blue'><b>Catherine</b></font>) dared hardly
touch them lest they should fawn upon her (<font color='blue'><b>Catherine</b></font>) splendid garments. She (<font color='blue'><b>Catherine</b></font>) kissed
me gently: I was all flour making the Christmas cake, and it would not
have done to give me a hug; and then she (<font color='blue'><b>Catherine</b></font>) looked round for Heathcliff. Mr.
and Mrs. Earnshaw watched anxiously their meeting; thinking it would
enable them to judge, in some measure, what grounds they had for hoping
to succeed in separating the two friends.

<p/>Heathcliff was hard to discover, at first. If he (<font color='blue'><b>Heathcliff</b></font>) were careless, and
uncared for, before Catherine's absence, he (<font color='blue'><b>Heathcliff</b></font>) had been ten times more so
since. Nobody but I even did him (<font color='blue'><b>Heathcliff</b></font>) the kindness to call him (<font color='blue'><b>Heathcliff</b></font>) a dirty boy,
and bid him (<font color='blue'><b>Heathcliff</b></font>) wash himself, once a week; and children of his (<font color='blue'><b>Heathcliff</b></font>) age seldom
have a natural pleasure in soap and water. Therefore, not to mention his (<font color='blue'><b>Heathcliff</b></font>)
clothes, which had seen three months' service in mire and dust, and his (<font color='blue'><b>Heathcliff</b></font>)
thick uncombed hair, the surface of his (<font color='blue'><b>Heathcliff</b></font>) face and hands was dismally
beclouded. He (<font color='blue'><b>Heathcliff</b></font>) might well skulk behind the settle, on beholding such a
bright, graceful damsel enter the house, instead of a rough-headed
counterpart of himself, as he (<font color='blue'><b>counterpart</b></font>) expected. <div class="bookquote">``Is Heathcliff not here?''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>damsel</b></font>)
demanded, pulling off her (<font color='blue'><b>damsel</b></font>) gloves, and displaying fingers wonderfully
whitened with doing nothing and staying indoors.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Heathcliff, you may come forward,''  (<font color='red'><b>Hindley/Mr. Hindley</b></font>)</div>cried Mr. Hindley, enjoying his (<font color='blue'><b>Hindley</b></font>)
discomfiture, and gratified to see what a forbidding young blackguard he (<font color='blue'><b>Hindley</b></font>)
would be compelled to present himself. <div class="bookquote">``You may come and wish Miss
Catherine welcome, like the other servants.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Cathy/Miss Cathy</b></font>)</div><p/>Cathy, catching a glimpse of her (<font color='blue'><b>Cathy</b></font>) friend in his (<font color='blue'><b>friend</b></font>) concealment, flew to
embrace him (<font color='blue'><b>friend</b></font>); she (<font color='blue'><b>Cathy</b></font>) bestowed seven or eight kisses on his (<font color='blue'><b>friend</b></font>) cheek within the
second, and then stopped, and drawing back, burst into a laugh,
exclaiming, <div class="bookquote">``Why, how very black and cross you look! and how--how funny
and grim! But that's because I'm used to Edgar and Isabella Linton.
Well, Heathcliff, have you forgotten me?''

 (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div><p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>Cathy</b></font>) had some reason to put the question, for shame and pride threw double
gloom over his (<font color='blue'><b>friend</b></font>) countenance, and kept him (<font color='blue'><b>friend</b></font>) immovable.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Shake hands, Heathcliff,''  (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Earnshaw</b></font>)</div>said Mr. Earnshaw, condescendingly; `once in a
way that is permitted.''

<p/><div class="bookquote">``I shall not,''  (<font color='red'><b>the boy</b></font>)</div>replied the boy, finding his (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>) tongue at last; <div class="bookquote">``I shall not
stand to be laughed at. I shall not bear it!''  (<font color='red'><b>the boy</b></font>)</div>And he (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>) would have broken
from the circle, but Miss Cathy seized him (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>) again.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``I did not mean to laugh at you,''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Cathy</b></font>) said; <div class="bookquote">``I could not hinder myself:
Heathcliff, shake hands at least! What are you sulky for? It was only
that you looked odd. If you wash your face and brush your hair, it will
be all right: but you are so dirty!''

 (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div><p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>Cathy</b></font>) gazed concernedly at the dusky fingers she (<font color='blue'><b>Cathy</b></font>) held in her (<font color='blue'><b>Cathy</b></font>) own, and also
at her (<font color='blue'><b>Cathy</b></font>) dress; which she (<font color='blue'><b>Cathy</b></font>) feared had gained no embellishment from its
contact with his (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>).

<p/><div class="bookquote">``You needn't have touched me!''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>) answered, following her (<font color='blue'><b>Cathy</b></font>) eye and
snatching away his (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>) hand. <div class="bookquote">``I shall be as dirty as I please: and I like to
be dirty, and I will be dirty.''

 (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div><p/>With that he (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>) dashed headforemost out of the room, amid the merriment of
the master and mistress, and to the serious disturbance of Catherine; who
could not comprehend how her (<font color='blue'><b>Catherine</b></font>) remarks should have produced such an
exhibition of bad temper.

<p/>After playing lady's-maid to the new-comer, and putting my cakes in the
oven, and making the house and kitchen cheerful with great fires,
befitting Christmas-eve, I prepared to sit down and amuse myself by
singing carols, all alone; regardless of Joseph's affirmations that he (<font color='blue'><b>Joseph</b></font>)
considered the merry tunes I chose as next door to songs. He (<font color='blue'><b>Joseph</b></font>) had retired
to private prayer in his (<font color='blue'><b>Joseph</b></font>) chamber, and Mr. and Mrs. Earnshaw were engaging
Missy's attention by sundry gay trifles bought for her (<font color='blue'><b>Earnshaw</b></font>) to present to the
little Lintons, as an acknowledgment of their kindness. They had invited
them to spend the morrow at Wuthering Heights, and the invitation had
been accepted, on one condition: Mrs. Linton begged that her (<font color='blue'><b>Linton</b></font>) darlings
might be kept carefully apart from that `naughty swearing boy.''

<p/>Under these circumstances I remained solitary. I smelt the rich scent of
the heating spices; and admired the shining kitchen utensils, the
polished clock, decked in holly, the silver mugs ranged on a tray ready
to be filled with mulled ale for supper; and above all, the speckless
purity of my particular care--the scoured and well-swept floor. I gave
due inward applause to every object, and then I remembered how old
Earnshaw used to come in when all was tidied, and call me a cant lass,
and slip a shilling into my hand as a Christmas-box; and from that I went
on to think of his (<font color='blue'><b>I</b></font>) fondness for Heathcliff, and his (<font color='blue'><b>I</b></font>) dread lest he (<font color='blue'><b>I</b></font>) should
suffer neglect after death had removed him (<font color='blue'><b>I</b></font>): and that naturally led me to
consider the poor lad's situation now, and from singing I changed my mind
to crying. It struck me soon, however, there would be more sense in
endeavouring to repair some of his (<font color='blue'><b>lad</b></font>) wrongs than shedding tears over them:
I got up and walked into the court to seek him (<font color='blue'><b>lad</b></font>). He (<font color='blue'><b>lad</b></font>) was not far; I found
him (<font color='blue'><b>lad</b></font>) smoothing the glossy coat of the new pony in the stable, and feeding
the other beasts, according to custom.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Make haste, Heathcliff!''  (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div>I said, `the kitchen is so comfortable; and
Joseph is up-stairs: make haste, and let me dress you smart before Miss
Cathy comes out, and then you can sit together, with the whole hearth to
yourselves, and have a long chatter till bedtime.''

<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Joseph</b></font>) proceeded with his (<font color='blue'><b>Joseph</b></font>) task, and never turned his (<font color='blue'><b>Joseph</b></font>) head towards me.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Come--are you coming?''  (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div>I continued. <div class="bookquote">``There's a little cake for each of
you, nearly enough; and you'll need half-an-hour's donning.''

 (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div><p/>I waited five minutes, but getting no answer left him (<font color='blue'><b>Joseph</b></font>). Catherine supped
with her (<font color='blue'><b>Catherine</b></font>) brother and sister-in-law: Joseph and I joined at an unsociable
meal, seasoned with reproofs on one side and sauciness on the other. His (<font color='blue'><b>Joseph</b></font>)
cake and cheese remained on the table all night for the fairies. He (<font color='blue'><b>Joseph</b></font>)
managed to continue work till nine o'clock, and then marched dumb and
dour to his (<font color='blue'><b>Joseph</b></font>) chamber. Cathy sat up late, having a world of things to
order for the reception of her (<font color='blue'><b>Cathy</b></font>) new friends: she (<font color='blue'><b>Cathy</b></font>) came into the kitchen
once to speak to her (<font color='blue'><b>Cathy</b></font>) old one; but he (<font color='blue'><b>Joseph</b></font>) was gone, and she (<font color='blue'><b>Cathy</b></font>) only stayed to ask
what was the matter with him (<font color='blue'><b>Joseph</b></font>), and then went back. In the morning he (<font color='blue'><b>Joseph</b></font>) rose
early; and, as it was a holiday, carried his (<font color='blue'><b>Joseph</b></font>) ill-humour on to the moors;
not re-appearing till the family were departed for church. Fasting and
reflection seemed to have brought him (<font color='blue'><b>Joseph</b></font>) to a better spirit. He (<font color='blue'><b>Joseph</b></font>) hung about
me for a while, and having screwed up his (<font color='blue'><b>Joseph</b></font>) courage, exclaimed
abruptly--<div class="bookquote">``Nelly, make me decent, I'm going to be good.''

 (<font color='red'><b>me</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``High time, Heathcliff,''  (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div>I said; `you _have_ grieved Catherine: she (<font color='blue'><b>Catherine</b></font>)'s
sorry she (<font color='blue'><b>Catherine</b></font>) ever came home, I daresay! It looks as if you envied her (<font color='blue'><b>Catherine</b></font>),
because she (<font color='blue'><b>Catherine</b></font>) is more thought of than you.''

<p/>The notion of _envying_ Catherine was incomprehensible to him (<font color='blue'><b>Joseph</b></font>), but the
notion of grieving her (<font color='blue'><b>Catherine</b></font>) he (<font color='blue'><b>Joseph</b></font>) understood clearly enough.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Did she (<font color='blue'><b>you</b></font>) say she (<font color='blue'><b>you</b></font>) was grieved?''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Joseph</b></font>) inquired, looking very serious.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``She (<font color='blue'><b>you</b></font>) cried when I told her (<font color='blue'><b>you</b></font>) you were off again this morning.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Well, _I_ cried last night,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Joseph</b></font>) returned, `and I had more reason to cry
than she (<font color='blue'><b>Catherine</b></font>).''

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Yes: you had the reason of going to bed with a proud heart and an empty
stomach,''  (<font color='red'><b>I.</b></font>)</div>said I. <div class="bookquote">``Proud people breed sad sorrows for themselves. But,
if you be ashamed of your touchiness, you must ask pardon, mind, when she (<font color='blue'><b>you</b></font>)
comes in. You must go up and offer to kiss her (<font color='blue'><b>you</b></font>), and say--you know best
what to say; only do it heartily, and not as if you thought her (<font color='blue'><b>you</b></font>) converted
into a stranger by her (<font color='blue'><b>you</b></font>) grand dress. And now, though I have dinner to get
ready, I'll steal time to arrange you so that Edgar Linton shall look
quite a doll beside you: and that he (<font color='blue'><b>Linton</b></font>) does. You are younger, and yet,
I'll be bound, you are taller and twice as broad across the shoulders;
you could knock him (<font color='blue'><b>Linton</b></font>) down in a twinkling; don't you feel that you could?''

 (<font color='red'><b>I.</b></font>)</div><p/>Heathcliff's face brightened a moment; then it was overcast afresh, and
he (<font color='blue'><b>Heathcliff</b></font>) sighed.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``But, Nelly, if I knocked him (<font color='blue'><b>Nelly</b></font>) down twenty times, that wouldn't make him (<font color='blue'><b>Nelly</b></font>)
less handsome or me more so. I wish I had light hair and a fair skin,
and was dressed and behaved as well, and had a chance of being as rich as
he (<font color='blue'><b>Nelly</b></font>) will be!''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``And cried for mamma at every turn,''  (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div>I added, `and trembled if a country
lad heaved his (<font color='blue'><b>lad</b></font>) fist against you, and sat at home all day for a shower of
rain. Oh, Heathcliff, you are showing a poor spirit! Come to the glass,
and I'll let you see what you should wish. Do you mark those two lines
between your eyes; and those thick brows, that, instead of rising arched,
sink in the middle; and that couple of black fiends, so deeply buried,
who never open their windows boldly, but lurk glinting under them, like
devil's spies? Wish and learn to smooth away the surly wrinkles, to
raise your lids frankly, and change the fiends to confident, innocent
angels, suspecting and doubting nothing, and always seeing friends where
they are not sure of foes. Don't get the expression of a vicious cur
that appears to know the kicks it gets are its dessert, and yet hates all
the world, as well as the kicker, for what it suffers.''

<p/><div class="bookquote">``In other words, I must wish for Edgar Linton's great blue eyes and even
forehead,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>kicker</b></font>) replied. <div class="bookquote">``I do--and that won't help me to them.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``A good heart will help you to a bonny face, my lad,''  (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div>I continued, `if
you were a regular black; and a bad one will turn the bonniest into
something worse than ugly. And now that we've done washing, and combing,
and sulking--tell me whether you don't think yourself rather handsome?
I'll tell you, I do. You're fit for a prince in disguise. Who knows but
your father was Emperor of China, and your mother an Indian queen, each
of them able to buy up, with one week's income, Wuthering Heights and
Thrushcross Grange together? And you were kidnapped by wicked sailors
and brought to England. Were I in your place, I would frame high notions
of my birth; and the thoughts of what I was should give me courage and
dignity to support the oppressions of a little farmer!''

<p/>So I chattered on; and Heathcliff gradually lost his (<font color='blue'><b>Heathcliff</b></font>) frown and began to
look quite pleasant, when all at once our conversation was interrupted by
a rumbling sound moving up the road and entering the court. He (<font color='blue'><b>Heathcliff</b></font>) ran to
the window and I to the door, just in time to behold the two Lintons
descend from the family carriage, smothered in cloaks and furs, and the
Earnshaws dismount from their horses: they often rode to church in
winter. Catherine took a hand of each of the children, and brought them
into the house and set them before the fire, which quickly put colour
into their white faces.

<p/>I urged my companion to hasten now and show his (<font color='blue'><b>companion</b></font>) amiable humour, and he (<font color='blue'><b>companion</b></font>)
willingly obeyed; but ill luck would have it that, as he (<font color='blue'><b>companion</b></font>) opened the door
leading from the kitchen on one side, Hindley opened it on the other.
They met, and the master, irritated at seeing him (<font color='blue'><b>master</b></font>) clean and cheerful, or,
perhaps, eager to keep his (<font color='blue'><b>master</b></font>) promise to Mrs. Linton, shoved him (<font color='blue'><b>master</b></font>) back with a
sudden thrust, and angrily bade Joseph `keep the fellow out of the
room--send him (<font color='blue'><b>Joseph</b></font>) into the garret till dinner is over. He (<font color='blue'><b>Joseph</b></font>)'ll be cramming
his (<font color='blue'><b>Joseph</b></font>) fingers in the tarts and stealing the fruit, if left alone with them
a minute.''

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Nay, sir,''  (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div>I could not avoid answering, `he (<font color='blue'><b>Joseph</b></font>)'ll touch nothing, not he (<font color='blue'><b>Joseph</b></font>):
and I suppose he (<font color='blue'><b>Joseph</b></font>) must have his (<font color='blue'><b>Joseph</b></font>) share of the dainties as well as we.''

<p/><div class="bookquote">``He (<font color='blue'><b>lad</b></font>) shall have his (<font color='blue'><b>lad</b></font>) share of my hand, if I catch him (<font color='blue'><b>lad</b></font>) downstairs till
dark,''  (<font color='red'><b>Hindley/Mr. Hindley</b></font>)</div>cried Hindley. <div class="bookquote">``Begone, you vagabond! What! you are attempting
the coxcomb, are you? Wait till I get hold of those elegant locks--see
if I won't pull them a bit longer!''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``They are long enough already,''  (<font color='red'><b>Master Linton</b></font>)</div>observed Master Linton, peeping from the
doorway; <div class="bookquote">``I wonder they don't make his (<font color='blue'><b>lad</b></font>) head ache. It's like a colt's
mane over his (<font color='blue'><b>lad</b></font>) eyes!''

 (<font color='red'><b>Master Linton</b></font>)</div><p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Hindley</b></font>) ventured this remark without any intention to insult; but Heathcliff's
violent nature was not prepared to endure the appearance of impertinence
from one whom he (<font color='blue'><b>Heathcliff</b></font>) seemed to hate, even then, as a rival. He (<font color='blue'><b>Heathcliff</b></font>) seized a
tureen of hot apple sauce -LRB-the first thing that came under his (<font color='blue'><b>Heathcliff</b></font>) grip-RRB- and
dashed it full against the speaker's face and neck; who instantly
commenced a lament that brought Isabella and Catherine hurrying to the
place. Mr. Earnshaw snatched up the culprit directly and conveyed him (<font color='blue'><b>Earnshaw</b></font>) to
his (<font color='blue'><b>Earnshaw</b></font>) chamber; where, doubtless, he (<font color='blue'><b>Earnshaw</b></font>) administered a rough remedy to cool the
fit of passion, for he (<font color='blue'><b>Earnshaw</b></font>) appeared red and breathless. I got the dishcloth,
and rather spitefully scrubbed Edgar's nose and mouth, affirming it
served him (<font color='blue'><b>Edgar</b></font>) right for meddling. His (<font color='blue'><b>Edgar</b></font>) sister began weeping to go home, and
Cathy stood by confounded, blushing for all.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``You should not have spoken to him (<font color='blue'><b>lad</b></font>)!''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Cathy</b></font>) expostulated with Master Linton.
<div class="bookquote">``He (<font color='blue'><b>lad</b></font>) was in a bad temper, and now you've spoilt your visit; and he (<font color='blue'><b>lad</b></font>)'ll be
flogged: I hate him (<font color='blue'><b>lad</b></font>) to be flogged! I can't eat my dinner. Why did you
speak to him (<font color='blue'><b>lad</b></font>), Edgar?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/>``I didn``t,'' sobbed the youth, escaping from my hands, and finishing the
remainder of the purification with his (<font color='blue'><b>Linton</b></font>) cambric pocket-handkerchief. ``I
promised mamma that I wouldn't say one word to him (<font color='blue'><b>Edgar</b></font>), and I didn<div class="bookquote">``t.''

 (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Well, don't cry,''  (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div>replied Catherine, contemptuously; `you're not killed.
Don't make more mischief; my brother is coming: be quiet! Hush,
Isabella! Has anybody hurt you?''

<p/><div class="bookquote">``There, there, children--to your seats!''  (<font color='red'><b>Hindley/Mr. Hindley</b></font>)</div>cried Hindley, bustling in.
<div class="bookquote">``That brute of a lad has warmed me nicely. Next time, Master Edgar, take
the law into your own fists--it will give you an appetite!''

 (<font color='red'><b>The party</b></font>)</div><p/>The little party recovered its equanimity at sight of the fragrant feast.
They were hungry after their ride, and easily consoled, since no real
harm had befallen them. Mr. Earnshaw carved bountiful platefuls, and the
mistress made them merry with lively talk. I waited behind her (<font color='blue'><b>mistress</b></font>) chair,
and was pained to behold Catherine, with dry eyes and an indifferent air,
commence cutting up the wing of a goose before her (<font color='blue'><b>Catherine</b></font>). <div class="bookquote">``An unfeeling
child,''  (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div>I thought to myself; `how lightly she (<font color='blue'><b>Catherine</b></font>) dismisses her (<font color='blue'><b>Catherine</b></font>) old
playmate's troubles. I could not have imagined her (<font color='blue'><b>Catherine</b></font>) to be so selfish.''
She (<font color='blue'><b>Catherine</b></font>) lifted a mouthful to her (<font color='blue'><b>Catherine</b></font>) lips: then she (<font color='blue'><b>Catherine</b></font>) set it down again: her (<font color='blue'><b>Catherine</b></font>) cheeks
flushed, and the tears gushed over them. She (<font color='blue'><b>Catherine</b></font>) slipped her (<font color='blue'><b>Catherine</b></font>) fork to the
floor, and hastily dived under the cloth to conceal her (<font color='blue'><b>Catherine</b></font>) emotion. I did
not call her (<font color='blue'><b>Catherine</b></font>) unfeeling long; for I perceived she (<font color='blue'><b>Catherine</b></font>) was in purgatory
throughout the day, and wearying to find an opportunity of getting by
herself, or paying a visit to Heathcliff, who had been locked up by the
master: as I discovered, on endeavouring to introduce to him (<font color='blue'><b>master</b></font>) a private
mess of victuals.

<p/>In the evening we had a dance. Cathy begged that he (<font color='blue'><b>master</b></font>) might be liberated
then, as Isabella Linton had no partner: her (<font color='blue'><b>Linton</b></font>) entreaties were vain, and I
was appointed to supply the deficiency. We got rid of all gloom in the
excitement of the exercise, and our pleasure was increased by the arrival
of the Gimmerton band, mustering fifteen strong: a trumpet, a trombone,
clarionets, bassoons, French horns, and a bass viol, besides singers.
They go the rounds of all the respectable houses, and receive
contributions every Christmas, and we esteemed it a first-rate treat to
hear them. After the usual carols had been sung, we set them to songs
and glees. Mrs. Earnshaw loved the music, and so they gave us plenty.

<p/>Catherine loved it too: but she (<font color='blue'><b>Catherine</b></font>) said it sounded sweetest at the top of
the steps, and she (<font color='blue'><b>Catherine</b></font>) went up in the dark: I followed. They shut the house
door below, never noting our absence, it was so full of people. She (<font color='blue'><b>Catherine</b></font>) made
no stay at the stairs'-head, but mounted farther, to the garret where
Heathcliff was confined, and called him (<font color='blue'><b>Heathcliff</b></font>). He (<font color='blue'><b>Heathcliff</b></font>) stubbornly declined
answering for a while: she (<font color='blue'><b>Catherine</b></font>) persevered, and finally persuaded him (<font color='blue'><b>Heathcliff</b></font>) to hold
communion with her (<font color='blue'><b>Catherine</b></font>) through the boards. I let the poor things converse
unmolested, till I supposed the songs were going to cease, and the
singers to get some refreshment: then I clambered up the ladder to warn
her (<font color='blue'><b>Catherine</b></font>). Instead of finding her (<font color='blue'><b>Catherine</b></font>) outside, I heard her (<font color='blue'><b>Catherine</b></font>) voice within. The
little monkey had crept by the skylight of one garret, along the roof,
into the skylight of the other, and it was with the utmost difficulty I
could coax her (<font color='blue'><b>Catherine</b></font>) out again. When she (<font color='blue'><b>Catherine</b></font>) did come, Heathcliff came with her (<font color='blue'><b>Catherine</b></font>),
and she (<font color='blue'><b>Catherine</b></font>) insisted that I should take him (<font color='blue'><b>Heathcliff</b></font>) into the kitchen, as my
fellow-servant had gone to a neighbour's, to be removed from the sound
of our `devil's psalmody,'' as it pleased him (<font color='blue'><b>devil</b></font>) to call it. I told them I
intended by no means to encourage their tricks: but as the prisoner had
never broken his (<font color='blue'><b>prisoner</b></font>) fast since yesterday's dinner, I would wink at his (<font color='blue'><b>prisoner</b></font>)
cheating Mr. Hindley that once. He (<font color='blue'><b>prisoner</b></font>) went down: I set him (<font color='blue'><b>prisoner</b></font>) a stool by the
fire, and offered him (<font color='blue'><b>prisoner</b></font>) a quantity of good things: but he (<font color='blue'><b>prisoner</b></font>) was sick and
could eat little, and my attempts to entertain him (<font color='blue'><b>prisoner</b></font>) were thrown away. He (<font color='blue'><b>prisoner</b></font>)
leant his (<font color='blue'><b>prisoner</b></font>) two elbows on his (<font color='blue'><b>prisoner</b></font>) knees, and his (<font color='blue'><b>prisoner</b></font>) chin on his (<font color='blue'><b>prisoner</b></font>) hands and
remained rapt in dumb meditation. On my inquiring the subject of his (<font color='blue'><b>prisoner</b></font>)
thoughts, he (<font color='blue'><b>prisoner</b></font>) answered gravely--<div class="bookquote">``I'm trying to settle how I shall pay
Hindley back. I don't care how long I wait, if I can only do it at last.
I hope he (<font color='blue'><b>Hindley</b></font>) will not die before I do!''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``For shame, Heathcliff!''  (<font color='red'><b>I.</b></font>)</div>said I. <div class="bookquote">``It is for God to punish wicked people;
we should learn to forgive.''

 (<font color='red'><b>I.</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``No, God won't have the satisfaction that I shall,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>prisoner</b></font>) returned. <div class="bookquote">``I only
wish I knew the best way! Let me alone, and I'll plan it out: while I'm
thinking of that I don't feel pain.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``But, Mr. Lockwood, I forget these tales cannot divert you. I'm annoyed
how I should dream of chattering on at such a rate; and your gruel cold,
and you nodding for bed! I could have told Heathcliff's history, all
that you need hear, in half a dozen words.''

 (<font color='red'><b>the housekeeper</b></font>)</div><p/>* * * * *

<p/>Thus interrupting herself, the housekeeper rose, and proceeded to lay
aside her (<font color='blue'><b>housekeeper</b></font>) sewing; but I felt incapable of moving from the hearth, and I
was very far from nodding. <div class="bookquote">``Sit still, Mrs. Dean,''  (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div>I cried; `do sit
still another half-hour. You've done just right to tell the story
leisurely. That is the method I like; and you must finish it in the same
style. I am interested in every character you have mentioned, more or
less.''

<p/><div class="bookquote">``The clock is on the stroke of eleven, sir.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``No matter--I'm not accustomed to go to bed in the long hours. One or
two is early enough for a person who lies till ten.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``You shouldn't lie till ten. There's the very prime of the morning gone
long before that time. A person who has not done one-half his (<font color='blue'><b>Heathcliff</b></font>) day's work
by ten o'clock, runs a chance of leaving the other half undone.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Nevertheless, Mrs. Dean, resume your chair; because to-morrow I intend
lengthening the night till afternoon. I prognosticate for myself an
obstinate cold, at least.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/>``I hope not, sir. Well, you must allow me to leap over some three years;
during that space Mrs. Earnshaw--'

<p/><div class="bookquote">``No, no, I'll allow nothing of the sort! Are you acquainted with the
mood of mind in which, if you were seated alone, and the cat licking its
kitten on the rug before you, you would watch the operation so intently
that puss's neglect of one ear would put you seriously out of temper?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``A terribly lazy mood, I should say.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``On the contrary, a tiresomely active one. It is mine, at present; and,
therefore, continue minutely. I perceive that people in these regions
acquire over people in towns the value that a spider in a dungeon does
over a spider in a cottage, to their various occupants; and yet the
deepened attraction is not entirely owing to the situation of the
looker-on. They _do_ live more in earnest, more in themselves, and less
in surface, change, and frivolous external things. I could fancy a love
for life here almost possible; and I was a fixed unbeliever in any love
of a year's standing. One state resembles setting a hungry man down to a
single dish, on which he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) may concentrate his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) entire appetite and do it
justice; the other, introducing him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) to a table laid out by French cooks:
he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) can perhaps extract as much enjoyment from the whole; but each part
is a mere atom in his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) regard and remembrance.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Oh! here we are the same as anywhere else, when you get to know us,''
 (<font color='red'><b>Mrs. Dean</b></font>)</div>observed Mrs. Dean, somewhat puzzled at my speech.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Excuse me,''  (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div>I responded; `you, my good friend, are a striking evidence
against that assertion. Excepting a few provincialisms of slight
consequence, you have no marks of the manners which I am habituated to
consider as peculiar to your class. I am sure you have thought a great
deal more than the generality of servants think. You have been compelled
to cultivate your reflective faculties for want of occasions for
frittering your life away in silly trifles.''

<p/>Mrs. Dean laughed.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``I certainly esteem myself a steady, reasonable kind of body,''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Dean</b></font>) said;
`not exactly from living among the hills and seeing one set of faces, and
one series of actions, from year's end to year's end; but I have
undergone sharp discipline, which has taught me wisdom; and then, I have
read more than you would fancy, Mr. Lockwood. You could not open a book
in this library that I have not looked into, and got something out of
also: unless it be that range of Greek and Latin, and that of French; and
those I know one from another: it is as much as you can expect of a poor
man's daughter. However, if I am to follow my story in true gossip's
fashion, I had better go on; and instead of leaping three years, I will
be content to pass to the next summer--the summer of 1778, that is nearly
twenty-three years ago.''




<p/>CHAPTER VIII


<p/>On the morning of a fine June day my first bonny little nursling, and the
last of the ancient Earnshaw stock, was born. We were busy with the hay
in a far-away field, when the girl that usually brought our breakfasts
came running an hour too soon across the meadow and up the lane, calling
me as she (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) ran.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Oh, such a grand bairn!''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) panted out. <div class="bookquote">``The finest lad that ever
breathed! But the doctor says missis must go: he (<font color='blue'><b>doctor</b></font>) says she (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>)'s been in a
consumption these many months. I heard him (<font color='blue'><b>doctor</b></font>) tell Mr. Hindley: and now she (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>)
has nothing to keep her (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>), and she (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>)'ll be dead before winter. You must come
home directly. You're to nurse it, Nelly: to feed it with sugar and
milk, and take care of it day and night. I wish I were you, because it
will be all yours when there is no missis!''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``But is she (<font color='blue'><b>nurse</b></font>) very ill?''  (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div>I asked, flinging down my rake and tying my
bonnet.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``I guess she (<font color='blue'><b>nurse</b></font>) is; yet she (<font color='blue'><b>nurse</b></font>) looks bravely,''  (<font color='red'><b>the girl</b></font>)</div>replied the girl, `and she (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) talks
as if she (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) thought of living to see it grow a man. She (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>)'s out of her (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) head
for joy, it's such a beauty! If I were her (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) I'm certain I should not die:
I should get better at the bare sight of it, in spite of Kenneth. I was
fairly mad at him (<font color='blue'><b>Kenneth</b></font>). Dame Archer brought the cherub down to master, in the
house, and his (<font color='blue'><b>Archer</b></font>) face just began to light up, when the old croaker steps
forward, and says he (<font color='blue'><b>Archer</b></font>)--<div class="bookquote">``Earnshaw, it's a blessing your wife has been
spared to leave you this son. When she (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>) came, I felt convinced we
shouldn't keep her (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>) long; and now, I must tell you, the winter will
probably finish her (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>). Don't take on, and fret about it too much: it can't
be helped. And besides, you should have known better than to choose such
a rush of a lass!'' (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>'

<p/><div class="bookquote">``And what did the master answer?''  (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div>I inquired.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``I think he (<font color='blue'><b>master</b></font>) swore: but I didn't mind him (<font color='blue'><b>master</b></font>), I was straining to see the
bairn,''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>and she (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) began again to describe it rapturously. I, as zealous as
herself, hurried eagerly home to admire, on my part; though I was very
sad for Hindley's sake. He (<font color='blue'><b>Hindley</b></font>) had room in his (<font color='blue'><b>Hindley</b></font>) heart only for two idols--his (<font color='blue'><b>Hindley</b></font>)
wife and himself: he (<font color='blue'><b>Hindley</b></font>) doted on both, and adored one, and I couldn't
conceive how he (<font color='blue'><b>Hindley</b></font>) would bear the loss.

<p/>When we got to Wuthering Heights, there he (<font color='blue'><b>Hindley</b></font>) stood at the front door; and,
as I passed in, I asked, `how was the baby?''

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Nearly ready to run about, Nell!''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Hindley</b></font>) replied, putting on a cheerful
smile.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``And the mistress?''  (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div>I ventured to inquire; `the doctor says she (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>)'s--'

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Damn the doctor!''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>doctor</b></font>) interrupted, reddening. <div class="bookquote">``Frances is quite right:
she (<font color='blue'><b>mistress</b></font>)'ll be perfectly well by this time next week. Are you going
up-stairs? will you tell her (<font color='blue'><b>mistress</b></font>) that I'll come, if she (<font color='blue'><b>mistress</b></font>)'ll promise not to
talk. I left her (<font color='blue'><b>mistress</b></font>) because she (<font color='blue'><b>mistress</b></font>) would not hold her (<font color='blue'><b>mistress</b></font>) tongue; and she (<font color='blue'><b>mistress</b></font>)
must--tell her (<font color='blue'><b>mistress</b></font>) Mr. Kenneth says she (<font color='blue'><b>mistress</b></font>) must be quiet.''

 (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div><p/>I delivered this message to Mrs. Earnshaw; she (<font color='blue'><b>Earnshaw</b></font>) seemed in flighty spirits,
and replied merrily, <div class="bookquote">``I hardly spoke a word, Ellen, and there he (<font color='blue'><b>Kenneth</b></font>) has gone
out twice, crying. Well, say I promise I won't speak: but that does not
bind me not to laugh at him (<font color='blue'><b>Kenneth</b></font>)!''

 (<font color='red'><b>spirits</b></font>)</div><p/>Poor soul! Till within a week of her (<font color='blue'><b>Earnshaw</b></font>) death that gay heart never failed
her (<font color='blue'><b>Earnshaw</b></font>); and her (<font color='blue'><b>Earnshaw</b></font>) husband persisted doggedly, nay, furiously, in affirming her (<font color='blue'><b>Earnshaw</b></font>)
health improved every day. When Kenneth warned him (<font color='blue'><b>Kenneth</b></font>) that his (<font color='blue'><b>Kenneth</b></font>) medicines
were useless at that stage of the malady, and he (<font color='blue'><b>Kenneth</b></font>) needn't put him (<font color='blue'><b>Kenneth</b></font>) to
further expense by attending her (<font color='blue'><b>Earnshaw</b></font>), he (<font color='blue'><b>Kenneth</b></font>) retorted, <div class="bookquote">``I know you need not--she (<font color='blue'><b>Ellen</b></font>)'s
well--she (<font color='blue'><b>Ellen</b></font>) does not want any more attendance from you! She (<font color='blue'><b>Ellen</b></font>) never was in a
consumption. It was a fever; and it is gone: her (<font color='blue'><b>Ellen</b></font>) pulse is as slow as
mine now, and her (<font color='blue'><b>Ellen</b></font>) cheek as cool.''

 (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div><p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Kenneth</b></font>) told his (<font color='blue'><b>Kenneth</b></font>) wife the same story, and she (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>) seemed to believe him (<font color='blue'><b>Kenneth</b></font>); but one
night, while leaning on his (<font color='blue'><b>Kenneth</b></font>) shoulder, in the act of saying she (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>) thought
she (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>) should be able to get up to-morrow, a fit of coughing took her (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>)--a
very slight one--he (<font color='blue'><b>Kenneth</b></font>) raised her (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>) in his (<font color='blue'><b>Kenneth</b></font>) arms; she (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>) put her (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>) two hands about
his (<font color='blue'><b>Kenneth</b></font>) neck, her (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>) face changed, and she (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>) was dead.

<p/>As the girl had anticipated, the child Hareton fell wholly into my hands.
Mr. Earnshaw, provided he (<font color='blue'><b>Earnshaw</b></font>) saw him (<font color='blue'><b>Earnshaw</b></font>) healthy and never heard him (<font color='blue'><b>Earnshaw</b></font>) cry, was
contented, as far as regarded him (<font color='blue'><b>Earnshaw</b></font>). For himself, he (<font color='blue'><b>Earnshaw</b></font>) grew desperate: his (<font color='blue'><b>Earnshaw</b></font>)
sorrow was of that kind that will not lament. He (<font color='blue'><b>Earnshaw</b></font>) neither wept nor
prayed; he (<font color='blue'><b>Earnshaw</b></font>) cursed and defied: execrated God and man, and gave himself up
to reckless dissipation. The servants could not bear his (<font color='blue'><b>God</b></font>) tyrannical and
evil conduct long: Joseph and I were the only two that would stay. I had
not the heart to leave my charge; and besides, you know, I had been his (<font color='blue'><b>Joseph</b></font>)
foster-sister, and excused his (<font color='blue'><b>Joseph</b></font>) behaviour more readily than a stranger
would. Joseph remained to hector over tenants and labourers; and because
it was his (<font color='blue'><b>Joseph</b></font>) vocation to be where he (<font color='blue'><b>Joseph</b></font>) had plenty of wickedness to reprove.

<p/>The master's bad ways and bad companions formed a pretty example for
Catherine and Heathcliff. His (<font color='blue'><b>Heathcliff</b></font>) treatment of the latter was enough to make
a fiend of a saint. And, truly, it appeared as if the lad _were_
possessed of something diabolical at that period. He (<font color='blue'><b>lad</b></font>) delighted to
witness Hindley degrading himself past redemption; and became daily more
notable for savage sullenness and ferocity. I could not half tell what
an infernal house we had. The curate dropped calling, and nobody decent
came near us, at last; unless Edgar Linton's visits to Miss Cathy might
be an exception. At fifteen she (<font color='blue'><b>Cathy</b></font>) was the queen of the country-side; she (<font color='blue'><b>Cathy</b></font>)
had no peer; and she (<font color='blue'><b>Cathy</b></font>) did turn out a haughty, headstrong creature! I own
I did not like her (<font color='blue'><b>Cathy</b></font>), after infancy was past; and I vexed her (<font color='blue'><b>Cathy</b></font>) frequently by
trying to bring down her (<font color='blue'><b>Cathy</b></font>) arrogance: she (<font color='blue'><b>Cathy</b></font>) never took an aversion to me,
though. She (<font color='blue'><b>Cathy</b></font>) had a wondrous constancy to old attachments: even Heathcliff
kept his (<font color='blue'><b>Heathcliff</b></font>) hold on her (<font color='blue'><b>Cathy</b></font>) affections unalterably; and young Linton, with all
his (<font color='blue'><b>Heathcliff</b></font>) superiority, found it difficult to make an equally deep impression.
He (<font color='blue'><b>Heathcliff</b></font>) was my late master: that is his (<font color='blue'><b>Heathcliff</b></font>) portrait over the fireplace. It used
to hang on one side, and his (<font color='blue'><b>Heathcliff</b></font>) wife's on the other; but hers has been
removed, or else you might see something of what she (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>) was. Can you make
that out?

<p/>Mrs. Dean raised the candle, and I discerned a soft-featured face,
exceedingly resembling the young lady at the Heights, but more pensive
and amiable in expression. It formed a sweet picture. The long light
hair curled slightly on the temples; the eyes were large and serious; the
figure almost too graceful. I did not marvel how Catherine Earnshaw
could forget her (<font color='blue'><b>Earnshaw</b></font>) first friend for such an individual. I marvelled much
how he (<font color='blue'><b>individual</b></font>), with a mind to correspond with his (<font color='blue'><b>individual</b></font>) person, could fancy my idea of
Catherine Earnshaw.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``A very agreeable portrait,''  (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div>I observed to the house-keeper. <div class="bookquote">``Is it
like?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Yes,''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Earnshaw</b></font>) answered; `but he (<font color='blue'><b>individual</b></font>) looked better when he (<font color='blue'><b>individual</b></font>) was animated; that is
his (<font color='blue'><b>individual</b></font>) everyday countenance: he (<font color='blue'><b>individual</b></font>) wanted spirit in general.''

<p/>Catherine had kept up her (<font color='blue'><b>Catherine</b></font>) acquaintance with the Lintons since her (<font color='blue'><b>Catherine</b></font>)
five-weeks' residence among them; and as she (<font color='blue'><b>Catherine</b></font>) had no temptation to show
her (<font color='blue'><b>Catherine</b></font>) rough side in their company, and had the sense to be ashamed of
being rude where she (<font color='blue'><b>Catherine</b></font>) experienced such invariable courtesy, she (<font color='blue'><b>Catherine</b></font>) imposed
unwittingly on the old lady and gentleman by her (<font color='blue'><b>Catherine</b></font>) ingenious cordiality;
gained the admiration of Isabella, and the heart and soul of her (<font color='blue'><b>Isabella</b></font>)
brother: acquisitions that flattered her (<font color='blue'><b>Isabella</b></font>) from the first--for she (<font color='blue'><b>Isabella</b></font>) was
full of ambition--and led her (<font color='blue'><b>Isabella</b></font>) to adopt a double character without
exactly intending to deceive any one. In the place where she (<font color='blue'><b>Isabella</b></font>) heard
Heathcliff termed a `vulgar young ruffian,<div class="bookquote">'' and `worse than a brute,''
 (<font color='red'><b>a ruffian</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Isabella</b></font>) took care not to act like him (<font color='blue'><b>Heathcliff</b></font>); but at home she (<font color='blue'><b>Isabella</b></font>) had small inclination
to practise politeness that would only be laughed at, and restrain an
unruly nature when it would bring her (<font color='blue'><b>Isabella</b></font>) neither credit nor praise.

<p/>Mr. Edgar seldom mustered courage to visit Wuthering Heights openly. He (<font color='blue'><b>Edgar</b></font>)
had a terror of Earnshaw's reputation, and shrunk from encountering him (<font color='blue'><b>Edgar</b></font>);
and yet he (<font color='blue'><b>Edgar</b></font>) was always received with our best attempts at civility: the
master himself avoided offending him (<font color='blue'><b>Edgar</b></font>), knowing why he (<font color='blue'><b>Edgar</b></font>) came; and if he (<font color='blue'><b>Edgar</b></font>)
could not be gracious, kept out of the way. I rather think his (<font color='blue'><b>Edgar</b></font>)
appearance there was distasteful to Catherine; she (<font color='blue'><b>Catherine</b></font>) was not artful, never
played the coquette, and had evidently an objection to her (<font color='blue'><b>Catherine</b></font>) two friends
meeting at all; for when Heathcliff expressed contempt of Linton in his (<font color='blue'><b>Heathcliff</b></font>)
presence, she (<font color='blue'><b>Linton</b></font>) could not half coincide, as she (<font color='blue'><b>Linton</b></font>) did in his (<font color='blue'><b>Heathcliff</b></font>) absence; and
when Linton evinced disgust and antipathy to Heathcliff, she (<font color='blue'><b>Linton</b></font>) dared not
treat his (<font color='blue'><b>Heathcliff</b></font>) sentiments with indifference, as if depreciation of her (<font color='blue'><b>Linton</b></font>)
playmate were of scarcely any consequence to her (<font color='blue'><b>Linton</b></font>). I've had many a laugh
at her (<font color='blue'><b>Linton</b></font>) perplexities and untold troubles, which she (<font color='blue'><b>Linton</b></font>) vainly strove to hide
from my mockery. That sounds ill-natured: but she (<font color='blue'><b>Linton</b></font>) was so proud it became
really impossible to pity her (<font color='blue'><b>Linton</b></font>) distresses, till she (<font color='blue'><b>Linton</b></font>) should be chastened
into more humility. She (<font color='blue'><b>Linton</b></font>) did bring herself, finally, to confess, and to
confide in me: there was not a soul else that she (<font color='blue'><b>Linton</b></font>) might fashion into an
adviser.

<p/>Mr. Hindley had gone from home one afternoon, and Heathcliff presumed to
give himself a holiday on the strength of it. He (<font color='blue'><b>Heathcliff</b></font>) had reached the age of
sixteen then, I think, and without having bad features, or being
deficient in intellect, he (<font color='blue'><b>Heathcliff</b></font>) contrived to convey an impression of inward
and outward repulsiveness that his (<font color='blue'><b>Heathcliff</b></font>) present aspect retains no traces of.
In the first place, he (<font color='blue'><b>Heathcliff</b></font>) had by that time lost the benefit of his (<font color='blue'><b>Heathcliff</b></font>) early
education: continual hard work, begun soon and concluded late, had
extinguished any curiosity he (<font color='blue'><b>Heathcliff</b></font>) once possessed in pursuit of knowledge, and
any love for books or learning. His (<font color='blue'><b>Heathcliff</b></font>) childhood's sense of superiority,
instilled into him (<font color='blue'><b>Heathcliff</b></font>) by the favours of old Mr. Earnshaw, was faded away. He (<font color='blue'><b>Earnshaw</b></font>)
struggled long to keep up an equality with Catherine in her (<font color='blue'><b>Catherine</b></font>) studies, and
yielded with poignant though silent regret: but he (<font color='blue'><b>Earnshaw</b></font>) yielded completely;
and there was no prevailing on him (<font color='blue'><b>Earnshaw</b></font>) to take a step in the way of moving
upward, when he (<font color='blue'><b>Earnshaw</b></font>) found he (<font color='blue'><b>Earnshaw</b></font>) must, necessarily, sink beneath his (<font color='blue'><b>Earnshaw</b></font>) former
level. Then personal appearance sympathised with mental deterioration:
he (<font color='blue'><b>Earnshaw</b></font>) acquired a slouching gait and ignoble look; his (<font color='blue'><b>Earnshaw</b></font>) naturally reserved
disposition was exaggerated into an almost idiotic excess of unsociable
moroseness; and he (<font color='blue'><b>Earnshaw</b></font>) took a grim pleasure, apparently, in exciting the
aversion rather than the esteem of his (<font color='blue'><b>Earnshaw</b></font>) few acquaintances.

<p/>Catherine and he (<font color='blue'><b>Earnshaw</b></font>) were constant companions still at his (<font color='blue'><b>Earnshaw</b></font>) seasons of respite
from labour; but he (<font color='blue'><b>Earnshaw</b></font>) had ceased to express his (<font color='blue'><b>Earnshaw</b></font>) fondness for her (<font color='blue'><b>Catherine</b></font>) in words,
and recoiled with angry suspicion from her (<font color='blue'><b>Catherine</b></font>) girlish caresses, as if
conscious there could be no gratification in lavishing such marks of
affection on him (<font color='blue'><b>Earnshaw</b></font>). On the before-named occasion he (<font color='blue'><b>Earnshaw</b></font>) came into the house to
announce his (<font color='blue'><b>Earnshaw</b></font>) intention of doing nothing, while I was assisting Miss Cathy
to arrange her (<font color='blue'><b>Cathy</b></font>) dress: she (<font color='blue'><b>Cathy</b></font>) had not reckoned on his (<font color='blue'><b>Earnshaw</b></font>) taking it into his (<font color='blue'><b>Earnshaw</b></font>) head
to be idle; and imagining she (<font color='blue'><b>Cathy</b></font>) would have the whole place to herself, she (<font color='blue'><b>Cathy</b></font>)
managed, by some means, to inform Mr. Edgar of her (<font color='blue'><b>Cathy</b></font>) brother's absence, and
was then preparing to receive him (<font color='blue'><b>Edgar</b></font>).

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Cathy, are you busy this afternoon?''  (<font color='red'><b>Heathcliff/Mr. Heathcliff</b></font>)</div>asked Heathcliff. <div class="bookquote">``Are you going
anywhere?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``No, it is raining,''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Cathy</b></font>) answered.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Why have you that silk frock on, then?''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Heathcliff</b></font>) said. <div class="bookquote">``Nobody coming here, I
hope?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Not that I know of,''  (<font color='red'><b>Heathcliff/Mr. Heathcliff</b></font>)</div>stammered Miss: `but you should be in the field
now, Heathcliff. It is an hour past dinnertime: I thought you were
gone.''

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Hindley does not often free us from his (<font color='blue'><b>Hindley</b></font>) accursed presence,''  (<font color='red'><b>the boy</b></font>)</div>observed the
boy. <div class="bookquote">``I'll not work any more to-day: I'll stay with you.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Oh, but Joseph will tell,''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Cathy</b></font>) suggested; `you'd better go!''

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Joseph is loading lime on the further side of Penistone Crags; it will
take him (<font color='blue'><b>Joseph</b></font>) till dark, and he (<font color='blue'><b>Joseph</b></font>)'ll never know.''

 (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div><p/>So, saying, he (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>) lounged to the fire, and sat down. Catherine reflected an
instant, with knitted brows--she (<font color='blue'><b>Catherine</b></font>) found it needful to smooth the way for
an intrusion. <div class="bookquote">``Isabella and Edgar Linton talked of calling this
afternoon,''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Catherine</b></font>) said, at the conclusion of a minute's silence. <div class="bookquote">``As it
rains, I hardly expect them; but they may come, and if they do, you run
the risk of being scolded for no good.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Order Ellen to say you are engaged, Cathy,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>) persisted; `don't turn me
out for those pitiful, silly friends of yours! I'm on the point,
sometimes, of complaining that they--but I'll not--'

<p/><div class="bookquote">``That they what?''  (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div>cried Catherine, gazing at him (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>) with a troubled
countenance. <div class="bookquote">``Oh, Nelly!''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Catherine</b></font>) added petulantly, jerking her (<font color='blue'><b>Catherine</b></font>) head away
from my hands, `you've combed my hair quite out of curl! That's enough;
let me alone. What are you on the point of complaining about,
Heathcliff?''

<p/>``Nothing--only look at the almanack on that wall;' he (<font color='blue'><b>Nelly</b></font>) pointed to a framed
sheet hanging near the window, and continued, <div class="bookquote">``The crosses are for the
evenings you have spent with the Lintons, the dots for those spent with
me. Do you see? I've marked every day.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Yes--very foolish: as if I took notice!''  (<font color='red'><b>Catherine/Earnshaw/Catherine Earnshaw</b></font>)</div>replied Catherine, in a peevish
tone. <div class="bookquote">``And where is the sense of that?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``To show that I _do_ take notice,''  (<font color='red'><b>Heathcliff/Mr. Heathcliff</b></font>)</div>said Heathcliff.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``And should I always be sitting with you?''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Catherine</b></font>) demanded, growing more
irritated. <div class="bookquote">``What good do I get? What do you talk about? You might be
dumb, or a baby, for anything you say to amuse me, or for anything you
do, either!''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``You never told me before that I talked too little, or that you disliked
my company, Cathy!''  (<font color='red'><b>Heathcliff/Mr. Heathcliff</b></font>)</div>exclaimed Heathcliff, in much agitation.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``It's no company at all, when people know nothing and say nothing,''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Catherine</b></font>)
muttered.

<p/>Her (<font color='blue'><b>Catherine</b></font>) companion rose up, but he (<font color='blue'><b>companion</b></font>) hadn't time to express his (<font color='blue'><b>companion</b></font>) feelings
further, for a horse's feet were heard on the flags, and having knocked
gently, young Linton entered, his (<font color='blue'><b>companion</b></font>) face brilliant with delight at the
unexpected summon she (<font color='blue'><b>Linton</b></font>) had received. Doubtless Catherine marked the
difference between her (<font color='blue'><b>Catherine</b></font>) friends, as one came in and the other went out.
The contrast resembled what you see in exchanging a bleak, hilly, coal
country for a beautiful fertile valley; and his (<font color='blue'><b>companion</b></font>) voice and greeting were
as opposite as his (<font color='blue'><b>companion</b></font>) aspect. He (<font color='blue'><b>companion</b></font>) had a sweet, low manner of speaking, and
pronounced his (<font color='blue'><b>companion</b></font>) words as you do: that's less gruff than we talk here, and
softer.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``I'm not come too soon, am I?''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>companion</b></font>) said, casting a look at me: I had begun
to wipe the plate, and tidy some drawers at the far end in the dresser.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``No,''  (<font color='red'><b>Catherine/Earnshaw/Catherine Earnshaw</b></font>)</div>answered Catherine. <div class="bookquote">``What are you doing there, Nelly?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``My work, Miss,''  (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div>I replied. -LRB-Mr. Hindley had given me directions to make
a third party in any private visits Linton chose to pay.-RRB-

<p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>Linton</b></font>) stepped behind me and whispered crossly, <div class="bookquote">``Take yourself and your
dusters off; when company are in the house, servants don't commence
scouring and cleaning in the room where they are!''

 (<font color='red'><b>me</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``It's a good opportunity, now that master is away,''  (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div>I answered aloud: `he (<font color='blue'><b>Hindley</b></font>)
hates me to be fidgeting over these things in his (<font color='blue'><b>Hindley</b></font>) presence. I'm sure Mr.
Edgar will excuse me.''

<p/><div class="bookquote">``I hate you to be fidgeting in _my_ presence,''  (<font color='red'><b>the lady</b></font>)</div>exclaimed the young lady
imperiously, not allowing her (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) guest time to speak: she (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) had failed to
recover her (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) equanimity since the little dispute with Heathcliff.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``I'm sorry for it, Miss Catherine,''  (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div>was my response; and I proceeded
assiduously with my occupation.

<p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>), supposing Edgar could not see her (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>), snatched the cloth from my hand,
and pinched me, with a prolonged wrench, very spitefully on the arm. I've
said I did not love her (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>), and rather relished mortifying her (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) vanity now
and then: besides, she (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) hurt me extremely; so I started up from my knees,
and screamed out, <div class="bookquote">``Oh, Miss, that's a nasty trick! You have no right to
nip me, and I'm not going to bear it.''

 (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I didn't touch you, you lying creature!''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>cried she (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>), her (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) fingers tingling
to repeat the act, and her (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) ears red with rage. She (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) never had power to
conceal her (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) passion, it always set her (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) whole complexion in a blaze.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``What's that, then?''  (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div>I retorted, showing a decided purple witness to
refute her (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>).

<p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) stamped her (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) foot, wavered a moment, and then, irresistibly impelled
by the naughty spirit within her (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>), slapped me on the cheek: a stinging
blow that filled both eyes with water.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Catherine, love! Catherine!''  (<font color='red'><b>Linton/Mrs. Linton/Mrs. Heathcliff</b></font>)</div>interposed Linton, greatly shocked at the
double fault of falsehood and violence which his (<font color='blue'><b>witness</b></font>) idol had committed.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Leave the room, Ellen!''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Linton</b></font>) repeated, trembling all over.

<p/>Little Hareton, who followed me everywhere, and was sitting near me on
the floor, at seeing my tears commenced crying himself, and sobbed out
complaints against `wicked aunt Cathy,'' which drew her (<font color='blue'><b>Cathy</b></font>) fury on to his (<font color='blue'><b>witness</b></font>)
unlucky head: she (<font color='blue'><b>Cathy</b></font>) seized his (<font color='blue'><b>witness</b></font>) shoulders, and shook him (<font color='blue'><b>witness</b></font>) till the poor child
waxed livid, and Edgar thoughtlessly laid hold of her (<font color='blue'><b>Cathy</b></font>) hands to deliver
him (<font color='blue'><b>Edgar</b></font>). In an instant one was wrung free, and the astonished young man felt
it applied over his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) own ear in a way that could not be mistaken for jest.
He (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) drew back in consternation. I lifted Hareton in my arms, and walked
off to the kitchen with him (<font color='blue'><b>Hareton</b></font>), leaving the door of communication open, for
I was curious to watch how they would settle their disagreement. The
insulted visitor moved to the spot where he (<font color='blue'><b>visitor</b></font>) had laid his (<font color='blue'><b>visitor</b></font>) hat, pale and
with a quivering lip.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``That's right!''  (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div>I said to myself. <div class="bookquote">``Take warning and begone! It's a
kindness to let you have a glimpse of her (<font color='blue'><b>Ellen</b></font>) genuine disposition.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Where are you going?''  (<font color='red'><b>Catherine/Earnshaw/Catherine Earnshaw</b></font>)</div>demanded Catherine, advancing to the door.

<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>visitor</b></font>) swerved aside, and attempted to pass.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``You must not go!''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Catherine</b></font>) exclaimed, energetically.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``I must and shall!''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>visitor</b></font>) replied in a subdued voice.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``No,''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Catherine</b></font>) persisted, grasping the handle; `not yet, Edgar Linton: sit
down; you shall not leave me in that temper. I should be miserable all
night, and I won't be miserable for you!''

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Can I stay after you have struck me?''  (<font color='red'><b>Linton/Mrs. Linton/Mrs. Heathcliff</b></font>)</div>asked Linton.

<p/>Catherine was mute.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``You've made me afraid and ashamed of you,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Linton</b></font>) continued; <div class="bookquote">``I'll not come
here again!''

 (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div><p/>Her (<font color='blue'><b>Catherine</b></font>) eyes began to glisten and her (<font color='blue'><b>Catherine</b></font>) lids to twinkle.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``And you told a deliberate untruth!''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Linton</b></font>) said.

<p/>``I didn``t!'' she (<font color='blue'><b>Catherine</b></font>) cried, recovering her (<font color='blue'><b>Catherine</b></font>) speech; <div class="bookquote">``I did nothing
deliberately. Well, go, if you please--get away! And now I'll cry--I'll
cry myself sick!''

 (<font color='red'><b>She</b></font>)</div><p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>Catherine</b></font>) dropped down on her (<font color='blue'><b>Catherine</b></font>) knees by a chair, and set to weeping in serious
earnest. Edgar persevered in his (<font color='blue'><b>Edgar</b></font>) resolution as far as the court; there
he (<font color='blue'><b>Edgar</b></font>) lingered. I resolved to encourage him (<font color='blue'><b>Edgar</b></font>).

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Miss is dreadfully wayward, sir,''  (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div>I called out. <div class="bookquote">``As bad as any marred
child: you'd better be riding home, or else she (<font color='blue'><b>I</b></font>) will be sick, only to
grieve us.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/>The soft thing looked askance through the window: he (<font color='blue'><b>Edgar</b></font>) possessed the power
to depart as much as a cat possesses the power to leave a mouse half
killed, or a bird half eaten. Ah, I thought, there will be no saving
him (<font color='blue'><b>Edgar</b></font>): he (<font color='blue'><b>Edgar</b></font>)'s doomed, and flies to his (<font color='blue'><b>Edgar</b></font>) fate! And so it was: he (<font color='blue'><b>Edgar</b></font>) turned
abruptly, hastened into the house again, shut the door behind him (<font color='blue'><b>Edgar</b></font>); and
when I went in a while after to inform them that Earnshaw had come home
rabid drunk, ready to pull the whole place about our ears -LRB-his (<font color='blue'><b>Edgar</b></font>) ordinary
frame of mind in that condition-RRB-, I saw the quarrel had merely effected a
closer intimacy--had broken the outworks of youthful timidity, and
enabled them to forsake the disguise of friendship, and confess
themselves lovers.

<p/>Intelligence of Mr. Hindley's arrival drove Linton speedily to his (<font color='blue'><b>Hindley</b></font>) horse,
and Catherine to her (<font color='blue'><b>Catherine</b></font>) chamber. I went to hide little Hareton, and to take
the shot out of the master's fowling-piece, which he (<font color='blue'><b>master</b></font>) was fond of playing
with in his (<font color='blue'><b>master</b></font>) insane excitement, to the hazard of the lives of any who
provoked, or even attracted his (<font color='blue'><b>master</b></font>) notice too much; and I had hit upon the
plan of removing it, that he (<font color='blue'><b>master</b></font>) might do less mischief if he (<font color='blue'><b>master</b></font>) did go the
length of firing the gun.




<p/>CHAPTER IX


<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>master</b></font>) entered, vociferating oaths dreadful to hear; and caught me in the act
of stowing his (<font color='blue'><b>master</b></font>) son away in the kitchen cupboard. Hareton was impressed
with a wholesome terror of encountering either his (<font color='blue'><b>Hareton</b></font>) wild beast's fondness
or his (<font color='blue'><b>Hareton</b></font>) madman's rage; for in one he (<font color='blue'><b>Hareton</b></font>) ran a chance of being squeezed and
kissed to death, and in the other of being flung into the fire, or dashed
against the wall; and the poor thing remained perfectly quiet wherever I
chose to put him (<font color='blue'><b>Hareton</b></font>).

<p/><div class="bookquote">``There, I've found it out at last!''  (<font color='red'><b>Hindley/Mr. Hindley</b></font>)</div>cried Hindley, pulling me back by the
skin of my neck, like a dog. <div class="bookquote">``By heaven and hell, you've sworn between
you to murder that child! I know how it is, now, that he (<font color='blue'><b>you</b></font>) is always out
of my way. But, with the help of Satan, I shall make you swallow the
carving-knife, Nelly! You needn't laugh; for I've just crammed Kenneth,
head-downmost, in the Black-horse marsh; and two is the same as one--and
I want to kill some of you: I shall have no rest till I do!''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``But I don't like the carving-knife, Mr. Hindley,''  (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div>I answered; `it has
been cutting red herrings. I'd rather be shot, if you please.''

<p/><div class="bookquote">``You'd rather be damned!''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Hindley</b></font>) said; `and so you shall. No law in England
can hinder a man from keeping his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) house decent, and mine's abominable!
Open your mouth.'' He (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) held the knife in his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) hand, and pushed its point
between my teeth: but, for my part, I was never much afraid of his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>)
vagaries. I spat out, and affirmed it tasted detestably--I would not
take it on any account.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Oh!''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>said he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>), releasing me, <div class="bookquote">``I see that hideous little villain is not
Hareton: I beg your pardon, Nell. If it be, he (<font color='blue'><b>villain</b></font>) deserves flaying alive
for not running to welcome me, and for screaming as if I were a goblin.
Unnatural cub, come hither! I'll teach thee to impose on a good-hearted,
deluded father. Now, don't you think the lad would be handsomer cropped?
It makes a dog fiercer, and I love something fierce--get me a
scissors--something fierce and trim! Besides, it's infernal
affectation--devilish conceit it is, to cherish our ears--we're asses
enough without them. Hush, child, hush! Well then, it is my darling!
wisht, dry thy eyes--there's a joy; kiss me. What! it won't? Kiss me,
Hareton! Damn thee, kiss me! By God, as if I would rear such a monster!
As sure as I'm living, I'll break the brat's neck.''

 (<font color='red'><b>me</b></font>)</div><p/>Poor Hareton was squalling and kicking in his (<font color='blue'><b>Hareton</b></font>) father's arms with all his (<font color='blue'><b>Hareton</b></font>)
might, and redoubled his (<font color='blue'><b>Hareton</b></font>) yells when he (<font color='blue'><b>Hareton</b></font>) carried him (<font color='blue'><b>Hareton</b></font>) up-stairs and lifted
him (<font color='blue'><b>Hareton</b></font>) over the banister. I cried out that he (<font color='blue'><b>Hareton</b></font>) would frighten the child into
fits, and ran to rescue him (<font color='blue'><b>Hareton</b></font>). As I reached them, Hindley leant forward on
the rails to listen to a noise below; almost forgetting what he (<font color='blue'><b>Hindley</b></font>) had in
his (<font color='blue'><b>Hindley</b></font>) hands. <div class="bookquote">``Who is that?''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Hindley</b></font>) asked, hearing some one approaching the
stairs'-foot. I leant forward also, for the purpose of signing to
Heathcliff, whose step I recognised, not to come further; and, at the
instant when my eye quitted Hareton, he (<font color='blue'><b>Hareton</b></font>) gave a sudden spring, delivered
himself from the careless grasp that held him (<font color='blue'><b>Hareton</b></font>), and fell.

<p/>There was scarcely time to experience a thrill of horror before we saw
that the little wretch was safe. Heathcliff arrived underneath just at
the critical moment; by a natural impulse he (<font color='blue'><b>Heathcliff</b></font>) arrested his (<font color='blue'><b>Heathcliff</b></font>) descent, and
setting him (<font color='blue'><b>Heathcliff</b></font>) on his (<font color='blue'><b>Heathcliff</b></font>) feet, looked up to discover the author of the
accident. A miser who has parted with a lucky lottery ticket for five
shillings, and finds next day he (<font color='blue'><b>miser</b></font>) has lost in the bargain five thousand
pounds, could not show a blanker countenance than he (<font color='blue'><b>miser</b></font>) did on beholding the
figure of Mr. Earnshaw above. It expressed, plainer than words could do,
the intensest anguish at having made himself the instrument of thwarting
his (<font color='blue'><b>Earnshaw</b></font>) own revenge. Had it been dark, I daresay he (<font color='blue'><b>Earnshaw</b></font>) would have tried to
remedy the mistake by smashing Hareton's skull on the steps; but, we
witnessed his (<font color='blue'><b>Hareton</b></font>) salvation; and I was presently below with my precious
charge pressed to my heart. Hindley descended more leisurely, sobered
and abashed.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``It is your fault, Ellen,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Hindley</b></font>) said; `you should have kept him (<font color='blue'><b>Hindley</b></font>) out of
sight: you should have taken him (<font color='blue'><b>Hindley</b></font>) from me! Is he (<font color='blue'><b>Hindley</b></font>) injured anywhere?''

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Injured!''  (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div>I cried angrily; `if he (<font color='blue'><b>Hindley</b></font>) is not killed, he (<font color='blue'><b>Hindley</b></font>)'ll be an idiot! Oh!
I wonder his (<font color='blue'><b>Hindley</b></font>) mother does not rise from her (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) grave to see how you use him (<font color='blue'><b>Hindley</b></font>).
You're worse than a heathen--treating your own flesh and blood in that
manner!'' He (<font color='blue'><b>Hindley</b></font>) attempted to touch the child, who, on finding himself with
me, sobbed off his (<font color='blue'><b>Hindley</b></font>) terror directly. At the first finger his (<font color='blue'><b>Hindley</b></font>) father laid
on him (<font color='blue'><b>Hindley</b></font>), however, he (<font color='blue'><b>Hindley</b></font>) shrieked again louder than before, and struggled as
if he (<font color='blue'><b>Hindley</b></font>) would go into convulsions.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``You shall not meddle with him (<font color='blue'><b>brat</b></font>)!''  (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div>I continued. <div class="bookquote">``He (<font color='blue'><b>brat</b></font>) hates you--they all
hate you--that's the truth! A happy family you have; and a pretty state
you're come to!''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I shall come to a prettier, yet, Nelly,''  (<font color='red'><b>the man</b></font>)</div>laughed the misguided man,
recovering his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) hardness. <div class="bookquote">``At present, convey yourself and him (<font color='blue'><b>Nelly</b></font>) away. And
hark you, Heathcliff! clear you too quite from my reach and hearing. I
wouldn't murder you to-night; unless, perhaps, I set the house on fire:
but that's as my fancy goes.''

 (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div><p/>While saying this he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) took a pint bottle of brandy from the dresser, and
poured some into a tumbler.

<p/>``Nay, don``t!'' I entreated. <div class="bookquote">``Mr. Hindley, do take warning. Have mercy on
this unfortunate boy, if you care nothing for yourself!''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Any one will do better for him (<font color='blue'><b>Hindley</b></font>) than I shall,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) answered.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Have mercy on your own soul!''  (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div>I said, endeavouring to snatch the glass
from his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) hand.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Not I! On the contrary, I shall have great pleasure in sending it to
perdition to punish its Maker,''  (<font color='red'><b>the blasphemer</b></font>)</div>exclaimed the blasphemer. <div class="bookquote">``Here's to its
hearty damnation!''

 (<font color='red'><b>He</b></font>)</div><p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) drank the spirits and impatiently bade us go; terminating his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) command
with a sequel of horrid imprecations too bad to repeat or remember.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``It's a pity he (<font color='blue'><b>Hindley</b></font>) cannot kill himself with drink,''  (<font color='red'><b>Heathcliff/Mr. Heathcliff</b></font>)</div>observed Heathcliff,
muttering an echo of curses back when the door was shut. <div class="bookquote">``He (<font color='blue'><b>Hindley</b></font>)'s doing his (<font color='blue'><b>Hindley</b></font>)
very utmost; but his (<font color='blue'><b>Hindley</b></font>) constitution defies him (<font color='blue'><b>Hindley</b></font>). Mr. Kenneth says he (<font color='blue'><b>Kenneth</b></font>) would
wager his (<font color='blue'><b>Kenneth</b></font>) mare that he (<font color='blue'><b>Kenneth</b></font>)'ll outlive any man on this side Gimmerton, and go
to the grave a hoary sinner; unless some happy chance out of the common
course befall him (<font color='blue'><b>sinner</b></font>).''

 (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div><p/>I went into the kitchen, and sat down to lull my little lamb to sleep.
Heathcliff, as I thought, walked through to the barn. It turned out
afterwards that he (<font color='blue'><b>Heathcliff</b></font>) only got as far as the other side the settle, when he (<font color='blue'><b>Heathcliff</b></font>)
flung himself on a bench by the wall, removed from the fire and remained
silent.

<p/>I was rocking Hareton on my knee, and humming a song that began,--

<p/>It was far in the night, and the bairnies grat,
The mither beneath the mools heard that,

<p/>when Miss Cathy, who had listened to the hubbub from her (<font color='blue'><b>Cathy</b></font>) room, put her (<font color='blue'><b>Cathy</b></font>)
head in, and whispered,--<div class="bookquote">``Are you alone, Nelly?''

 (<font color='red'><b>Cathy/Miss Cathy</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Yes, Miss,''  (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div>I replied.

<p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>Cathy</b></font>) entered and approached the hearth. I, supposing she (<font color='blue'><b>Cathy</b></font>) was going to say
something, looked up. The expression of her (<font color='blue'><b>Cathy</b></font>) face seemed disturbed and
anxious. Her (<font color='blue'><b>Cathy</b></font>) lips were half asunder, as if she (<font color='blue'><b>Cathy</b></font>) meant to speak, and she (<font color='blue'><b>Cathy</b></font>)
drew a breath; but it escaped in a sigh instead of a sentence. I resumed
my song; not having forgotten her (<font color='blue'><b>Cathy</b></font>) recent behaviour.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Where's Heathcliff?''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Cathy</b></font>) said, interrupting me.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``About his (<font color='blue'><b>Heathcliff</b></font>) work in the stable,''  (<font color='red'><b>He</b></font>)</div>was my answer.

<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>it</b></font>) did not contradict me; perhaps he (<font color='blue'><b>it</b></font>) had fallen into a doze. There
followed another long pause, during which I perceived a drop or two
trickle from Catherine's cheek to the flags. Is she (<font color='blue'><b>Catherine</b></font>) sorry for her (<font color='blue'><b>Catherine</b></font>)
shameful conduct?--I asked myself. That will be a novelty: but she (<font color='blue'><b>Catherine</b></font>) may
come to the point--as she (<font color='blue'><b>Catherine</b></font>) will--I sha'n't help her (<font color='blue'><b>Catherine</b></font>)! No, she (<font color='blue'><b>Catherine</b></font>) felt small
trouble regarding any subject, save her (<font color='blue'><b>Catherine</b></font>) own concerns.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Oh, dear!''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Catherine</b></font>) cried at last. <div class="bookquote">``I'm very unhappy!''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``A pity,''  (<font color='red'><b>I. friends</b></font>)</div>observed I. <div class="bookquote">``You're hard to please; so many friends and so few
cares, and can't make yourself content!''

 (<font color='red'><b>I. friends</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Nelly, will you keep a secret for me?''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Catherine</b></font>) pursued, kneeling down by me,
and lifting her (<font color='blue'><b>Catherine</b></font>) winsome eyes to my face with that sort of look which
turns off bad temper, even when one has all the right in the world to
indulge it.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Is it worth keeping?''  (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div>I inquired, less sulkily.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Yes, and it worries me, and I must let it out! I want to know what I
should do. To-day, Edgar Linton has asked me to marry him (<font color='blue'><b>Linton</b></font>), and I've
given him (<font color='blue'><b>Linton</b></font>) an answer. Now, before I tell you whether it was a consent or
denial, you tell me which it ought to have been.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Really, Miss Catherine, how can I know?''  (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div>I replied. <div class="bookquote">``To be sure,
considering the exhibition you performed in his (<font color='blue'><b>Linton</b></font>) presence this afternoon,
I might say it would be wise to refuse him (<font color='blue'><b>Linton</b></font>): since he (<font color='blue'><b>Linton</b></font>) asked you after
that, he (<font color='blue'><b>Linton</b></font>) must either be hopelessly stupid or a venturesome fool.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``If you talk so, I won't tell you any more,''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Catherine</b></font>) returned, peevishly
rising to her (<font color='blue'><b>Catherine</b></font>) feet. <div class="bookquote">``I accepted him (<font color='blue'><b>Linton</b></font>), Nelly. Be quick, and say whether I
was wrong!''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``You accepted him (<font color='blue'><b>Nelly</b></font>)! Then what good is it discussing the matter? You have
pledged your word, and cannot retract.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``But say whether I should have done so--do!''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Catherine</b></font>) exclaimed in an
irritated tone; chafing her (<font color='blue'><b>Catherine</b></font>) hands together, and frowning.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``There are many things to be considered before that question can be
answered properly,''  (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div>I said, sententiously. <div class="bookquote">``First and foremost, do you
love Mr. Edgar?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Who can help it? Of course I do,''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Catherine</b></font>) answered.

<p/>Then I put her (<font color='blue'><b>Catherine</b></font>) through the following catechism: for a girl of twenty-two
it was not injudicious.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Why do you love him (<font color='blue'><b>Edgar</b></font>), Miss Cathy?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Nonsense, I do--that's sufficient.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``By no means; you must say why?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Well, because he (<font color='blue'><b>Edgar</b></font>) is handsome, and pleasant to be with.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Bad!''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>was my commentary.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``And because he (<font color='blue'><b>Edgar</b></font>) is young and cheerful.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Bad, still.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``And because he (<font color='blue'><b>Edgar</b></font>) loves me.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Indifferent, coming there.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``And he (<font color='blue'><b>Edgar</b></font>) will be rich, and I shall like to be the greatest woman of the
neighbourhood, and I shall be proud of having such a husband.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Worst of all. And now, say how you love him (<font color='blue'><b>husband</b></font>)?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``As everybody loves--You're silly, Nelly.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Not at all--Answer.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I love the ground under his (<font color='blue'><b>Nelly</b></font>) feet, and the air over his (<font color='blue'><b>Nelly</b></font>) head, and
everything he (<font color='blue'><b>Nelly</b></font>) touches, and every word he (<font color='blue'><b>Nelly</b></font>) says. I love all his (<font color='blue'><b>Nelly</b></font>) looks, and
all his (<font color='blue'><b>Nelly</b></font>) actions, and him (<font color='blue'><b>Nelly</b></font>) entirely and altogether. There now!''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``And why?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Nay; you are making a jest of it: it is exceedingly ill-natured! It's
no jest to me!''  (<font color='red'><b>the lady</b></font>)</div>said the young lady, scowling, and turning her (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) face to
the fire.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``I'm very far from jesting, Miss Catherine,''  (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div>I replied. <div class="bookquote">``You love Mr.
Edgar because he (<font color='blue'><b>Edgar</b></font>) is handsome, and young, and cheerful, and rich, and
loves you. The last, however, goes for nothing: you would love him (<font color='blue'><b>Edgar</b></font>)
without that, probably; and with it you wouldn't, unless he (<font color='blue'><b>Edgar</b></font>) possessed the
four former attractions.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``No, to be sure not: I should only pity him (<font color='blue'><b>Edgar</b></font>)--hate him (<font color='blue'><b>Edgar</b></font>), perhaps, if he (<font color='blue'><b>Edgar</b></font>)
were ugly, and a clown.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``But there are several other handsome, rich young men in the world:
handsomer, possibly, and richer than he (<font color='blue'><b>Edgar</b></font>) is. What should hinder you from
loving them?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``If there be any, they are out of my way: I've seen none like Edgar.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``You may see some; and he (<font color='blue'><b>Edgar</b></font>) won't always be handsome, and young, and may
not always be rich.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``He (<font color='blue'><b>Edgar</b></font>) is now; and I have only to do with the present. I wish you would
speak rationally.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Well, that settles it: if you have only to do with the present, marry
Mr. Linton.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I don't want your permission for that--I _shall_ marry him (<font color='blue'><b>Linton</b></font>): and yet you
have not told me whether I'm right.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Perfectly right; if people be right to marry only for the present. And
now, let us hear what you are unhappy about. Your brother will be
pleased; the old lady and gentleman will not object, I think; you will
escape from a disorderly, comfortless home into a wealthy, respectable
one; and you love Edgar, and Edgar loves you. All seems smooth and easy:
where is the obstacle?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/>'_Here_! and _here_!<div class="bookquote">'' replied Catherine, striking one hand on her (<font color='blue'><b>Catherine</b></font>)
forehead, and the other on her (<font color='blue'><b>Catherine</b></font>) breast: `in whichever place the soul
lives. In my soul and in my heart, I'm convinced I'm wrong!''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``That's very strange! I cannot make it out.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``It's my secret. But if you will not mock at me, I'll explain it: I
can't do it distinctly; but I'll give you a feeling of how I feel.''

 (<font color='red'><b>She</b></font>)</div><p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>Catherine</b></font>) seated herself by me again: her (<font color='blue'><b>Catherine</b></font>) countenance grew sadder and graver,
and her (<font color='blue'><b>Catherine</b></font>) clasped hands trembled.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Nelly, do you never dream queer dreams?''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Catherine</b></font>) said, suddenly, after some
minutes' reflection.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Yes, now and then,''  (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div>I answered.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``And so do I. I've dreamt in my life dreams that have stayed with me
ever after, and changed my ideas: they've gone through and through me,
like wine through water, and altered the colour of my mind. And this is
one: I'm going to tell it--but take care not to smile at any part of it.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Oh! don't, Miss Catherine!''  (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div>I cried. <div class="bookquote">``We're dismal enough without
conjuring up ghosts and visions to perplex us. Come, come, be merry and
like yourself! Look at little Hareton! _he (<font color='blue'><b>ghosts</b></font>)'s_ dreaming nothing dreary.
How sweetly he (<font color='blue'><b>ghosts</b></font>) smiles in his (<font color='blue'><b>ghosts</b></font>) sleep!''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Yes; and how sweetly his (<font color='blue'><b>ghosts</b></font>) father curses in his (<font color='blue'><b>ghosts</b></font>) solitude! You remember
him (<font color='blue'><b>ghosts</b></font>), I daresay, when he (<font color='blue'><b>ghosts</b></font>) was just such another as that chubby thing:
nearly as young and innocent. However, Nelly, I shall oblige you to
listen: it's not long; and I've no power to be merry to-night.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I won't hear it, I won't hear it!''  (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div>I repeated, hastily.

<p/>I was superstitious about dreams then, and am still; and Catherine had an
unusual gloom in her (<font color='blue'><b>Catherine</b></font>) aspect, that made me dread something from which I
might shape a prophecy, and foresee a fearful catastrophe. She (<font color='blue'><b>Catherine</b></font>) was
vexed, but she (<font color='blue'><b>Catherine</b></font>) did not proceed. Apparently taking up another subject,
she (<font color='blue'><b>Catherine</b></font>) recommenced in a short time.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``If I were in heaven, Nelly, I should be extremely miserable.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Because you are not fit to go there,''  (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div>I answered. <div class="bookquote">``All sinners would be
miserable in heaven.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``But it is not for that. I dreamt once that I was there.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I tell you I won't hearken to your dreams, Miss Catherine! I'll go to
bed,''  (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div>I interrupted again.

<p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>Catherine</b></font>) laughed, and held me down; for I made a motion to leave my chair.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``This is nothing,''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>cried she (<font color='blue'><b>Catherine</b></font>): <div class="bookquote">``I was only going to say that heaven did
not seem to be my home; and I broke my heart with weeping to come back to
earth; and the angels were so angry that they flung me out into the
middle of the heath on the top of Wuthering Heights; where I woke sobbing
for joy. That will do to explain my secret, as well as the other. I've
no more business to marry Edgar Linton than I have to be in heaven; and
if the wicked man in there had not brought Heathcliff so low, I shouldn't
have thought of it. It would degrade me to marry Heathcliff now; so he (<font color='blue'><b>Heathcliff</b></font>)
shall never know how I love him (<font color='blue'><b>Heathcliff</b></font>): and that, not because he (<font color='blue'><b>Heathcliff</b></font>)'s handsome,
Nelly, but because he (<font color='blue'><b>Nelly</b></font>)'s more myself than I am. Whatever our souls are
made of, his (<font color='blue'><b>Nelly</b></font>) and mine are the same; and Linton's is as different as a
moonbeam from lightning, or frost from fire.''

 (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div><p/>Ere this speech ended I became sensible of Heathcliff's presence. Having
noticed a slight movement, I turned my head, and saw him (<font color='blue'><b>Heathcliff</b></font>) rise from the
bench, and steal out noiselessly. He (<font color='blue'><b>Heathcliff</b></font>) had listened till he (<font color='blue'><b>Heathcliff</b></font>) heard
Catherine say it would degrade her (<font color='blue'><b>Catherine</b></font>) to marry him (<font color='blue'><b>Heathcliff</b></font>), and then he (<font color='blue'><b>Heathcliff</b></font>) stayed to
hear no further. My companion, sitting on the ground, was prevented by
the back of the settle from remarking his (<font color='blue'><b>companion</b></font>) presence or departure; but I
started, and bade her (<font color='blue'><b>Catherine</b></font>) hush!

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Why?''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Catherine</b></font>) asked, gazing nervously round.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Joseph is here,''  (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div>I answered, catching opportunely the roll of his (<font color='blue'><b>companion</b></font>)
cartwheels up the road; `and Heathcliff will come in with him (<font color='blue'><b>Heathcliff</b></font>). I'm not
sure whether he (<font color='blue'><b>Heathcliff</b></font>) were not at the door this moment.''

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Oh, he (<font color='blue'><b>Joseph</b></font>) couldn't overhear me at the door!''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>said she (<font color='blue'><b>Catherine</b></font>). <div class="bookquote">``Give me Hareton,
while you get the supper, and when it is ready ask me to sup with you. I
want to cheat my uncomfortable conscience, and be convinced that
Heathcliff has no notion of these things. He (<font color='blue'><b>Heathcliff</b></font>) has not, has he (<font color='blue'><b>Heathcliff</b></font>)? He (<font color='blue'><b>Heathcliff</b></font>) does
not know what being in love is!''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I see no reason that he (<font color='blue'><b>Heathcliff</b></font>) should not know, as well as you,''  (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div>I returned;
`and if you are his (<font color='blue'><b>Heathcliff</b></font>) choice, he (<font color='blue'><b>Heathcliff</b></font>)'ll be the most unfortunate creature that
ever was born! As soon as you become Mrs. Linton, he (<font color='blue'><b>Heathcliff</b></font>) loses friend, and
love, and all! Have you considered how you'll bear the separation, and
how he (<font color='blue'><b>Heathcliff</b></font>)'ll bear to be quite deserted in the world? Because, Miss
Catherine--'

<p/><div class="bookquote">``He (<font color='blue'><b>Heathcliff</b></font>) quite deserted! we separated!''  (<font color='red'><b>Miss Catherine</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Catherine</b></font>) exclaimed, with an accent of
indignation. <div class="bookquote">``Who is to separate us, pray? They'll meet the fate of
Milo! Not as long as I live, Ellen: for no mortal creature. Every
Linton on the face of the earth might melt into nothing before I could
consent to forsake Heathcliff. Oh, that's not what I intend--that's not
what I mean! I shouldn't be Mrs. Linton were such a price demanded!
He (<font color='blue'><b>Heathcliff</b></font>)'ll be as much to me as he (<font color='blue'><b>Heathcliff</b></font>) has been all his (<font color='blue'><b>Heathcliff</b></font>) lifetime. Edgar must shake
off his (<font color='blue'><b>Edgar</b></font>) antipathy, and tolerate him (<font color='blue'><b>Edgar</b></font>), at least. He (<font color='blue'><b>Edgar</b></font>) will, when he (<font color='blue'><b>Edgar</b></font>) learns
my true feelings towards him (<font color='blue'><b>Edgar</b></font>). Nelly, I see now you think me a selfish
wretch; but did it never strike you that if Heathcliff and I married, we
should be beggars? whereas, if I marry Linton I can aid Heathcliff to
rise, and place him (<font color='blue'><b>Heathcliff</b></font>) out of my brother's power.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``With your husband's money, Miss Catherine?''  (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div>I asked. <div class="bookquote">``You'll find him (<font color='blue'><b>husband</b></font>)
not so pliable as you calculate upon: and, though I'm hardly a judge, I
think that's the worst motive you've given yet for being the wife of
young Linton.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``It is not,''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>retorted she (<font color='blue'><b>Catherine</b></font>); `it is the best! The others were the
satisfaction of my whims: and for Edgar's sake, too, to satisfy him (<font color='blue'><b>Edgar</b></font>). This
is for the sake of one who comprehends in his (<font color='blue'><b>Edgar</b></font>) person my feelings to Edgar
and myself. I cannot express it; but surely you and everybody have a
notion that there is or should be an existence of yours beyond you. What
were the use of my creation, if I were entirely contained here? My great
miseries in this world have been Heathcliff's miseries, and I watched and
felt each from the beginning: my great thought in living is himself. If
all else perished, and _he (<font color='blue'><b>Heathcliff</b></font>)_ remained, _I_ should still continue to be;
and if all else remained, and he (<font color='blue'><b>Heathcliff</b></font>) were annihilated, the universe would
turn to a mighty stranger: I should not seem a part of it.--My love for
Linton is like the foliage in the woods: time will change it, I'm well
aware, as winter changes the trees. My love for Heathcliff resembles the
eternal rocks beneath: a source of little visible delight, but necessary.
Nelly, I _am_ Heathcliff! He (<font color='blue'><b>Heathcliff</b></font>)'s always, always in my mind: not as a
pleasure, any more than I am always a pleasure to myself, but as my own
being. So don't talk of our separation again: it is impracticable; and--'

<p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>Linton</b></font>) paused, and hid her (<font color='blue'><b>Linton</b></font>) face in the folds of my gown; but I jerked it
forcibly away. I was out of patience with her (<font color='blue'><b>Linton</b></font>) folly!

<p/><div class="bookquote">``If I can make any sense of your nonsense, Miss,''  (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div>I said, `it only goes
to convince me that you are ignorant of the duties you undertake in
marrying; or else that you are a wicked, unprincipled girl. But trouble
me with no more secrets: I'll not promise to keep them.''

<p/><div class="bookquote">``You'll keep that?''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) asked, eagerly.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``No, I'll not promise,''  (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div>I repeated.

<p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) was about to insist, when the entrance of Joseph finished our
conversation; and Catherine removed her (<font color='blue'><b>Catherine</b></font>) seat to a corner, and nursed
Hareton, while I made the supper. After it was cooked, my fellow-servant
and I began to quarrel who should carry some to Mr. Hindley; and we
didn't settle it till all was nearly cold. Then we came to the agreement
that we would let him (<font color='blue'><b>Hindley</b></font>) ask, if he (<font color='blue'><b>Hindley</b></font>) wanted any; for we feared particularly
to go into his (<font color='blue'><b>Hindley</b></font>) presence when he (<font color='blue'><b>Hindley</b></font>) had been some time alone.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``And how isn't that nowt comed in fro' th' field, be this time? What is
he (<font color='blue'><b>judge</b></font>) about? girt idle seeght!''  (<font color='red'><b>the man round</b></font>)</div>demanded the old man, looking round for
Heathcliff.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``I'll call him (<font color='blue'><b>judge</b></font>),''  (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div>I replied. <div class="bookquote">``He (<font color='blue'><b>judge</b></font>)'s in the barn, I've no doubt.''

 (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div><p/>I went and called, but got no answer. On returning, I whispered to
Catherine that he (<font color='blue'><b>Heathcliff</b></font>) had heard a good part of what she (<font color='blue'><b>Catherine</b></font>) said, I was sure; and
told how I saw him (<font color='blue'><b>Heathcliff</b></font>) quit the kitchen just as she (<font color='blue'><b>Catherine</b></font>) complained of her (<font color='blue'><b>Catherine</b></font>)
brother's conduct regarding him (<font color='blue'><b>Heathcliff</b></font>). She (<font color='blue'><b>Catherine</b></font>) jumped up in a fine fright, flung
Hareton on to the settle, and ran to seek for her (<font color='blue'><b>Catherine</b></font>) friend herself; not
taking leisure to consider why she (<font color='blue'><b>Catherine</b></font>) was so flurried, or how her (<font color='blue'><b>Catherine</b></font>) talk would
have affected him (<font color='blue'><b>friend</b></font>). She (<font color='blue'><b>Catherine</b></font>) was absent such a while that Joseph proposed we
should wait no longer. He (<font color='blue'><b>Joseph</b></font>) cunningly conjectured they were staying away
in order to avoid hearing his (<font color='blue'><b>Joseph</b></font>) protracted blessing. They were `ill eneugh
for ony fahl manners,'' he (<font color='blue'><b>Joseph</b></font>) affirmed. And on their behalf he (<font color='blue'><b>Joseph</b></font>) added that
night a special prayer to the usual quarter-of-an-hour's supplication
before meat, and would have tacked another to the end of the grace, had
not his (<font color='blue'><b>Joseph</b></font>) young mistress broken in upon him (<font color='blue'><b>Joseph</b></font>) with a hurried command that he (<font color='blue'><b>Joseph</b></font>)
must run down the road, and, wherever Heathcliff had rambled, find and
make him (<font color='blue'><b>Heathcliff</b></font>) re-enter directly!

<p/><div class="bookquote">``I want to speak to him (<font color='blue'><b>judge</b></font>), and I _must_, before I go upstairs,''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>mistress</b></font>) said.
<div class="bookquote">``And the gate is open: he (<font color='blue'><b>judge</b></font>) is somewhere out of hearing; for he (<font color='blue'><b>judge</b></font>) would not
reply, though I shouted at the top of the fold as loud as I could.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Joseph</b></font>)</div><p/>Joseph objected at first; she (<font color='blue'><b>mistress</b></font>) was too much in earnest, however, to suffer
contradiction; and at last he (<font color='blue'><b>Joseph</b></font>) placed his (<font color='blue'><b>Joseph</b></font>) hat on his (<font color='blue'><b>Joseph</b></font>) head, and walked
grumbling forth. Meantime, Catherine paced up and down the floor,
exclaiming--<div class="bookquote">``I wonder where he (<font color='blue'><b>judge</b></font>) is--I wonder where he (<font color='blue'><b>judge</b></font>) can be! What did I
say, Nelly? I've forgotten. Was he (<font color='blue'><b>Nelly</b></font>) vexed at my bad humour this
afternoon? Dear! tell me what I've said to grieve him (<font color='blue'><b>Nelly</b></font>)? I do wish he (<font color='blue'><b>Nelly</b></font>)'d
come. I do wish he (<font color='blue'><b>Nelly</b></font>) would!''

 (<font color='red'><b>Catherine/Earnshaw/Catherine Earnshaw</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``What a noise for nothing!''  (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div>I cried, though rather uneasy myself. <div class="bookquote">``What
a trifle scares you! It's surely no great cause of alarm that Heathcliff
should take a moonlight saunter on the moors, or even lie too sulky to
speak to us in the hay-loft. I'll engage he (<font color='blue'><b>Heathcliff</b></font>)'s lurking there. See if I
don't ferret him (<font color='blue'><b>Heathcliff</b></font>) out!''

 (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div><p/>I departed to renew my search; its result was disappointment, and
Joseph's quest ended in the same.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Yon lad gets war und war!''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>observed he (<font color='blue'><b>Joseph</b></font>) on re-entering. <div class="bookquote">``He (<font color='blue'><b>lad</b></font>)'s left th'

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Have you found Heathcliff, you ass?''  (<font color='red'><b>Catherine/Earnshaw/Catherine Earnshaw</b></font>)</div>interrupted Catherine. <div class="bookquote">``Have you
been looking for him (<font color='blue'><b>Heathcliff</b></font>), as I ordered?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I sud more likker look for th' horse,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Joseph</b></font>) replied. <div class="bookquote">``It `ud be to more

this--as black as t' chimbley! und Heathcliff's noan t' chap to coom at
_my_ whistle--happen he (<font color='blue'><b>chap</b></font>)'ll be less hard o' hearing wi' _ye_!''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/>It _was_ a very dark evening for summer: the clouds appeared inclined to
thunder, and I said we had better all sit down; the approaching rain
would be certain to bring him (<font color='blue'><b>Joseph</b></font>) home without further trouble. However,
Catherine would not be persuaded into tranquillity. She (<font color='blue'><b>Catherine</b></font>) kept wandering
to and fro, from the gate to the door, in a state of agitation which
permitted no repose; and at length took up a permanent situation on one
side of the wall, near the road: where, heedless of my expostulations and
the growling thunder, and the great drops that began to plash around her (<font color='blue'><b>Catherine</b></font>),
she (<font color='blue'><b>Catherine</b></font>) remained, calling at intervals, and then listening, and then crying
outright. She (<font color='blue'><b>Catherine</b></font>) beat Hareton, or any child, at a good passionate fit of
crying.

<p/>About midnight, while we still sat up, the storm came rattling over the
Heights in full fury. There was a violent wind, as well as thunder, and
either one or the other split a tree off at the corner of the building: a
huge bough fell across the roof, and knocked down a portion of the east
chimney-stack, sending a clatter of stones and soot into the
kitchen-fire. We thought a bolt had fallen in the middle of us; and
Joseph swung on to his (<font color='blue'><b>Joseph</b></font>) knees, beseeching the Lord to remember the
patriarchs Noah and Lot, and, as in former times, spare the righteous,
though he (<font color='blue'><b>Noah</b></font>) smote the ungodly. I felt some sentiment that it must be a
judgment on us also. The Jonah, in my mind, was Mr. Earnshaw; and I
shook the handle of his (<font color='blue'><b>Earnshaw</b></font>) den that I might ascertain if he (<font color='blue'><b>Earnshaw</b></font>) were yet living.
He (<font color='blue'><b>Earnshaw</b></font>) replied audibly enough, in a fashion which made my companion
vociferate, more clamorously than before, that a wide distinction might
be drawn between saints like himself and sinners like his (<font color='blue'><b>Earnshaw</b></font>) master. But
the uproar passed away in twenty minutes, leaving us all unharmed;
excepting Cathy, who got thoroughly drenched for her (<font color='blue'><b>Cathy</b></font>) obstinacy in
refusing to take shelter, and standing bonnetless and shawlless to catch
as much water as she (<font color='blue'><b>Cathy</b></font>) could with her (<font color='blue'><b>Cathy</b></font>) hair and clothes. She (<font color='blue'><b>Cathy</b></font>) came in and
lay down on the settle, all soaked as she (<font color='blue'><b>Cathy</b></font>) was, turning her (<font color='blue'><b>Cathy</b></font>) face to the
back, and putting her (<font color='blue'><b>Cathy</b></font>) hands before it.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Well, Miss!''  (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div>I exclaimed, touching her (<font color='blue'><b>Cathy</b></font>) shoulder; `you are not bent on
getting your death, are you? Do you know what o'clock it is? Half-past
twelve. Come, come to bed! there's no use waiting any longer on that
foolish boy: he (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>)'ll be gone to Gimmerton, and he (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>)'ll stay there now. He (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>)
guesses we shouldn't wait for him (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>) till this late hour: at least, he (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>)
guesses that only Mr. Hindley would be up; and he (<font color='blue'><b>Hindley</b></font>)'d rather avoid having
the door opened by the master.''

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Nay, nay, he (<font color='blue'><b>chap</b></font>)'s noan at Gimmerton,''  (<font color='red'><b>Joseph</b></font>)</div>said Joseph. <div class="bookquote">``I's niver wonder but
he (<font color='blue'><b>chap</b></font>)'s at t' bothom of a bog-hoile. This visitation worn't for nowt, and I
wod hev' ye to look out, Miss--yah muh be t' next. Thank Hivin for all!
All warks togither for gooid to them as is chozzen, and piked out fro'
th' rubbidge! Yah knaw whet t' Scripture ses.''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>And he (<font color='blue'><b>Joseph</b></font>) began quoting
several texts, referring us to chapters and verses where we might find
them.

<p/>I, having vainly begged the wilful girl to rise and remove her (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) wet
things, left him (<font color='blue'><b>Joseph</b></font>) preaching and her (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) shivering, and betook myself to bed
with little Hareton, who slept as fast as if everyone had been sleeping
round him (<font color='blue'><b>Hareton</b></font>). I heard Joseph read on a while afterwards; then I
distinguished his (<font color='blue'><b>Joseph</b></font>) slow step on the ladder, and then I dropped asleep.

<p/>Coming down somewhat later than usual, I saw, by the sunbeams piercing
the chinks of the shutters, Miss Catherine still seated near the
fireplace. The house-door was ajar, too; light entered from its unclosed
windows; Hindley had come out, and stood on the kitchen hearth, haggard
and drowsy.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``What ails you, Cathy?''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Hindley</b></font>) was saying when I entered: `you look as dismal
as a drowned whelp. Why are you so damp and pale, child?''

<p/><div class="bookquote">``I've been wet,''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Catherine</b></font>) answered reluctantly, `and I'm cold, that's all.''

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Oh, she (<font color='blue'><b>Cathy</b></font>) is naughty!''  (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div>I cried, perceiving the master to be tolerably
sober. <div class="bookquote">``She (<font color='blue'><b>Cathy</b></font>) got steeped in the shower of yesterday evening, and there
she (<font color='blue'><b>Cathy</b></font>) has sat the night through, and I couldn't prevail on her (<font color='blue'><b>Cathy</b></font>) to stir.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Earnshaw</b></font>)</div><p/>Mr. Earnshaw stared at us in surprise. <div class="bookquote">``The night through,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Earnshaw</b></font>) repeated.
<div class="bookquote">``What kept her (<font color='blue'><b>Cathy</b></font>) up? not fear of the thunder, surely? That was over hours
since.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Heathcliff/Mr. Heathcliff</b></font>)</div><p/>Neither of us wished to mention Heathcliff's absence, as long as we could
conceal it; so I replied, I didn't know how she (<font color='blue'><b>Catherine</b></font>) took it into her (<font color='blue'><b>Catherine</b></font>) head to
sit up; and she (<font color='blue'><b>Catherine</b></font>) said nothing. The morning was fresh and cool; I threw
back the lattice, and presently the room filled with sweet scents from
the garden; but Catherine called peevishly to me, <div class="bookquote">``Ellen, shut the
window. I'm starving!''  (<font color='red'><b>me</b></font>)</div>And her (<font color='blue'><b>Catherine</b></font>) teeth chattered as she (<font color='blue'><b>Catherine</b></font>) shrank closer to
the almost extinguished embers.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``She (<font color='blue'><b>Ellen</b></font>)'s ill,''  (<font color='red'><b>Hindley/Mr. Hindley</b></font>)</div>said Hindley, taking her (<font color='blue'><b>Catherine</b></font>) wrist; <div class="bookquote">``I suppose that's the reason
she (<font color='blue'><b>Ellen</b></font>) would not go to bed. Damn it! I don't want to be troubled with more
sickness here. What took you into the rain?''

 (<font color='red'><b>Hindley/Mr. Hindley</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Running after t' lads, as usuald!''  (<font color='red'><b>Joseph</b></font>)</div>croaked Joseph, catching an
opportunity from our hesitation to thrust in his (<font color='blue'><b>Hindley</b></font>) evil tongue. <div class="bookquote">``If I war
yah, maister, I'd just slam t' boards i' their faces all on 'em, gentle
and simple! Never a day ut yah're off, but yon cat o' Linton comes
sneaking hither; and Miss Nelly, shoo's a fine lass! shoo sits watching
for ye i' t' kitchen; and as yah're in at one door, he (<font color='blue'><b>lads</b></font>)'s out at t`other;
and, then, wer grand lady goes a-courting of her (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) side! It's bonny
behaviour, lurking amang t' fields, after twelve o' t' night, wi' that
fahl, flaysome divil of a gipsy, Heathcliff! They think _I'm_ blind; but
I'm noan: nowt ut t' soart!--I seed young Linton boath coming and going,
and I seed _yah_' -LRB-directing his (<font color='blue'><b>Heathcliff</b></font>) discourse to me-RRB-, `yah gooid fur nowt,
slattenly witch! nip up and bolt into th' house, t' minute yah heard t'
maister's horse-fit clatter up t' road.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Silence, eavesdropper!''  (<font color='red'><b>Catherine/Earnshaw/Catherine Earnshaw</b></font>)</div>cried Catherine; `none of your insolence before
me! Edgar Linton came yesterday by chance, Hindley; and it was _I_ who
told him (<font color='blue'><b>Linton</b></font>) to be off: because I knew you would not like to have met him (<font color='blue'><b>Linton</b></font>) as
you were.''

<p/><div class="bookquote">``You lie, Cathy, no doubt,''  (<font color='red'><b>brother</b></font>)</div>answered her (<font color='blue'><b>Catherine</b></font>) brother, `and you are a
confounded simpleton! But never mind Linton at present: tell me, were
you not with Heathcliff last night? Speak the truth, now. You need not
be afraid of harming him (<font color='blue'><b>Heathcliff</b></font>): though I hate him (<font color='blue'><b>Heathcliff</b></font>) as much as ever, he (<font color='blue'><b>Heathcliff</b></font>) did me a
good turn a short time since that will make my conscience tender of
breaking his (<font color='blue'><b>Heathcliff</b></font>) neck. To prevent it, I shall send him (<font color='blue'><b>Heathcliff</b></font>) about his (<font color='blue'><b>Heathcliff</b></font>) business
this very morning; and after he (<font color='blue'><b>Heathcliff</b></font>)'s gone, I'd advise you all to look sharp:
I shall only have the more humour for you.''

<p/><div class="bookquote">``I never saw Heathcliff last night,''  (<font color='red'><b>Catherine/Earnshaw/Catherine Earnshaw</b></font>)</div>answered Catherine, beginning to sob
bitterly: `and if you do turn him (<font color='blue'><b>Heathcliff</b></font>) out of doors, I'll go with him (<font color='blue'><b>Heathcliff</b></font>). But,
perhaps, you'll never have an opportunity: perhaps, he (<font color='blue'><b>Heathcliff</b></font>)'s gone.'' Here she (<font color='blue'><b>Catherine</b></font>)
burst into uncontrollable grief, and the remainder of her (<font color='blue'><b>Catherine</b></font>) words were
inarticulate.

<p/>Hindley lavished on her (<font color='blue'><b>Catherine</b></font>) a torrent of scornful abuse, and bade her (<font color='blue'><b>Catherine</b></font>) get to
her (<font color='blue'><b>Catherine</b></font>) room immediately, or she (<font color='blue'><b>Catherine</b></font>) shouldn't cry for nothing! I obliged her (<font color='blue'><b>Catherine</b></font>) to
obey; and I shall never forget what a scene she (<font color='blue'><b>Catherine</b></font>) acted when we reached her (<font color='blue'><b>Catherine</b></font>)
chamber: it terrified me. I thought she (<font color='blue'><b>Catherine</b></font>) was going mad, and I begged
Joseph to run for the doctor. It proved the commencement of delirium:
Mr. Kenneth, as soon as he (<font color='blue'><b>Kenneth</b></font>) saw her (<font color='blue'><b>Catherine</b></font>), pronounced her (<font color='blue'><b>Catherine</b></font>) dangerously ill; she (<font color='blue'><b>Catherine</b></font>)
had a fever. He (<font color='blue'><b>Kenneth</b></font>) bled her (<font color='blue'><b>Catherine</b></font>), and he (<font color='blue'><b>Kenneth</b></font>) told me to let her (<font color='blue'><b>Catherine</b></font>) live on whey and
water-gruel, and take care she (<font color='blue'><b>Catherine</b></font>) did not throw herself downstairs or out of
the window; and then he (<font color='blue'><b>Kenneth</b></font>) left: for he (<font color='blue'><b>Kenneth</b></font>) had enough to do in the parish,
where two or three miles was the ordinary distance between cottage and
cottage.

<p/>Though I cannot say I made a gentle nurse, and Joseph and the master were
no better, and though our patient was as wearisome and headstrong as a
patient could be, she (<font color='blue'><b>nurse</b></font>) weathered it through. Old Mrs. Linton paid us
several visits, to be sure, and set things to rights, and scolded and
ordered us all; and when Catherine was convalescent, she (<font color='blue'><b>Catherine</b></font>) insisted on
conveying her (<font color='blue'><b>Catherine</b></font>) to Thrushcross Grange: for which deliverance we were very
grateful. But the poor dame had reason to repent of her (<font color='blue'><b>Catherine</b></font>) kindness: she (<font color='blue'><b>Catherine</b></font>)
and her (<font color='blue'><b>Catherine</b></font>) husband both took the fever, and died within a few days of each
other.

<p/>Our young lady returned to us saucier and more passionate, and haughtier
than ever. Heathcliff had never been heard of since the evening of the
thunder-storm; and, one day, I had the misfortune, when she (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) had provoked
me exceedingly, to lay the blame of his (<font color='blue'><b>Heathcliff</b></font>) disappearance on her (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>): where
indeed it belonged, as she (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) well knew. From that period, for several
months, she (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) ceased to hold any communication with me, save in the
relation of a mere servant. Joseph fell under a ban also: he (<font color='blue'><b>Joseph</b></font>) would speak
his (<font color='blue'><b>Joseph</b></font>) mind, and lecture her (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) all the same as if she (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) were a little girl; and
she (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) esteemed herself a woman, and our mistress, and thought that her (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>)
recent illness gave her (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) a claim to be treated with consideration. Then
the doctor had said that she (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) would not bear crossing much; she (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) ought to
have her (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) own way; and it was nothing less than murder in her (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) eyes for any
one to presume to stand up and contradict her (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>). From Mr. Earnshaw and his (<font color='blue'><b>Earnshaw</b></font>)
companions she (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) kept aloof; and tutored by Kenneth, and serious threats of
a fit that often attended her (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) rages, her (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) brother allowed her (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) whatever she (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>)
pleased to demand, and generally avoided aggravating her (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) fiery temper. He (<font color='blue'><b>brother</b></font>)
was rather too indulgent in humouring her (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) caprices; not from affection,
but from pride: he (<font color='blue'><b>brother</b></font>) wished earnestly to see her (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) bring honour to the family
by an alliance with the Lintons, and as long as she (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) let him (<font color='blue'><b>brother</b></font>) alone she (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>)
might trample on us like slaves, for aught he (<font color='blue'><b>brother</b></font>) cared! Edgar Linton, as
multitudes have been before and will be after him (<font color='blue'><b>Linton</b></font>), was infatuated: and
believed himself the happiest man alive on the day he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) led her (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) to
Gimmerton Chapel, three years subsequent to his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) father's death.

<p/>Much against my inclination, I was persuaded to leave Wuthering Heights
and accompany her (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) here. Little Hareton was nearly five years old, and I
had just begun to teach him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) letters. We made a sad parting; but
Catherine's tears were more powerful than ours. When I refused to go,
and when she (<font color='blue'><b>Catherine</b></font>) found her (<font color='blue'><b>Catherine</b></font>) entreaties did not move me, she (<font color='blue'><b>Catherine</b></font>) went lamenting to
her (<font color='blue'><b>Catherine</b></font>) husband and brother. The former offered me munificent wages; the
latter ordered me to pack up: he (<font color='blue'><b>brother</b></font>) wanted no women in the house, he (<font color='blue'><b>brother</b></font>) said,
now that there was no mistress; and as to Hareton, the curate should take
him (<font color='blue'><b>brother</b></font>) in hand, by-and-by. And so I had but one choice left: to do as I was
ordered. I told the master he (<font color='blue'><b>master</b></font>) got rid of all decent people only to run
to ruin a little faster; I kissed Hareton, said good-by; and since then
he (<font color='blue'><b>Hareton</b></font>) has been a stranger: and it's very queer to think it, but I've no
doubt he (<font color='blue'><b>Hareton</b></font>) has completely forgotten all about Ellen Dean, and that he (<font color='blue'><b>Hareton</b></font>) was
ever more than all the world to her (<font color='blue'><b>Dean</b></font>) and she (<font color='blue'><b>Dean</b></font>) to him (<font color='blue'><b>Hareton</b></font>)!

<p/>* * * * *

<p/>At this point of the housekeeper's story she (<font color='blue'><b>Dean</b></font>) chanced to glance towards
the time-piece over the chimney; and was in amazement on seeing the
minute-hand measure half-past one. She (<font color='blue'><b>Dean</b></font>) would not hear of staying a
second longer: in truth, I felt rather disposed to defer the sequel of
her (<font color='blue'><b>Dean</b></font>) narrative myself. And now that she (<font color='blue'><b>Dean</b></font>) is vanished to her (<font color='blue'><b>Dean</b></font>) rest, and I
have meditated for another hour or two, I shall summon courage to go
also, in spite of aching laziness of head and limbs.




<p/>CHAPTER X


<p/>A charming introduction to a hermit's life! Four weeks' torture,
tossing, and sickness! Oh, these bleak winds and bitter northern skies,
and impassable roads, and dilatory country surgeons! And oh, this dearth
of the human physiognomy! and, worse than all, the terrible intimation of
Kenneth that I need not expect to be out of doors till spring!

<p/>Mr. Heathcliff has just honoured me with a call. About seven days ago he (<font color='blue'><b>Heathcliff</b></font>)
sent me a brace of grouse--the last of the season. Scoundrel! He (<font color='blue'><b>Heathcliff</b></font>) is not
altogether guiltless in this illness of mine; and that I had a great mind
to tell him (<font color='blue'><b>Heathcliff</b></font>). But, alas! how could I offend a man who was charitable
enough to sit at my bedside a good hour, and talk on some other subject
than pills and draughts, blisters and leeches? This is quite an easy
interval. I am too weak to read; yet I feel as if I could enjoy
something interesting. Why not have up Mrs. Dean to finish her (<font color='blue'><b>Dean</b></font>) tale? I
can recollect its chief incidents, as far as she (<font color='blue'><b>Dean</b></font>) had gone. Yes: I
remember her (<font color='blue'><b>Dean</b></font>) hero had run off, and never been heard of for three years;
and the heroine was married. I'll ring: she (<font color='blue'><b>heroine</b></font>)'ll be delighted to find me
capable of talking cheerfully. Mrs. Dean came.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``It wants twenty minutes, sir, to taking the medicine,''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Dean</b></font>) commenced.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Away, away with it!''  (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div>I replied; ``I desire to have--'

<p/><div class="bookquote">``The doctor says you must drop the powders.''

 (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``With all my heart! Don't interrupt me. Come and take your seat here.
Keep your fingers from that bitter phalanx of vials. Draw your knitting
out of your pocket--that will do--now continue the history of Mr.
Heathcliff, from where you left off, to the present day. Did he (<font color='blue'><b>Heathcliff</b></font>) finish
his (<font color='blue'><b>Heathcliff</b></font>) education on the Continent, and come back a gentleman? or did he (<font color='blue'><b>Heathcliff</b></font>) get
a sizar's place at college, or escape to America, and earn honours by
drawing blood from his (<font color='blue'><b>Heathcliff</b></font>) foster-country? or make a fortune more promptly on
the English highways?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``He (<font color='blue'><b>Heathcliff</b></font>) may have done a little in all these vocations, Mr. Lockwood; but I
couldn't give my word for any. I stated before that I didn't know how he (<font color='blue'><b>Lockwood</b></font>)
gained his (<font color='blue'><b>Lockwood</b></font>) money; neither am I aware of the means he (<font color='blue'><b>Lockwood</b></font>) took to raise his (<font color='blue'><b>Lockwood</b></font>)
mind from the savage ignorance into which it was sunk: but, with your
leave, I'll proceed in my own fashion, if you think it will amuse and not
weary you. Are you feeling better this morning?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Much.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``That's good news.''

 (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div><p/>* * * * *

<p/>I got Miss Catherine and myself to Thrushcross Grange; and, to my
agreeable disappointment, she (<font color='blue'><b>Catherine</b></font>) behaved infinitely better than I dared to
expect. She (<font color='blue'><b>Catherine</b></font>) seemed almost over-fond of Mr. Linton; and even to his (<font color='blue'><b>Linton</b></font>)
sister she (<font color='blue'><b>Catherine</b></font>) showed plenty of affection. They were both very attentive to
her (<font color='blue'><b>Catherine</b></font>) comfort, certainly. It was not the thorn bending to the
honeysuckles, but the honeysuckles embracing the thorn. There were no
mutual concessions: one stood erect, and the others yielded: and who can
be ill-natured and bad-tempered when they encounter neither opposition
nor indifference? I observed that Mr. Edgar had a deep-rooted fear of
ruffling her (<font color='blue'><b>Catherine</b></font>) humour. He (<font color='blue'><b>Edgar</b></font>) concealed it from her (<font color='blue'><b>Catherine</b></font>); but if ever he (<font color='blue'><b>Edgar</b></font>) heard me
answer sharply, or saw any other servant grow cloudy at some imperious
order of hers, he (<font color='blue'><b>Edgar</b></font>) would show his (<font color='blue'><b>Edgar</b></font>) trouble by a frown of displeasure that
never darkened on his (<font color='blue'><b>Edgar</b></font>) own account. He (<font color='blue'><b>Edgar</b></font>) many a time spoke sternly to me
about my pertness; and averred that the stab of a knife could not inflict
a worse pang than he (<font color='blue'><b>Edgar</b></font>) suffered at seeing his (<font color='blue'><b>Edgar</b></font>) lady vexed. Not to grieve a
kind master, I learned to be less touchy; and, for the space of half a
year, the gunpowder lay as harmless as sand, because no fire came near to
explode it. Catherine had seasons of gloom and silence now and then:
they were respected with sympathising silence by her (<font color='blue'><b>Catherine</b></font>) husband, who
ascribed them to an alteration in her (<font color='blue'><b>Catherine</b></font>) constitution, produced by her (<font color='blue'><b>Catherine</b></font>)
perilous illness; as she (<font color='blue'><b>Catherine</b></font>) was never subject to depression of spirits
before. The return of sunshine was welcomed by answering sunshine from
him (<font color='blue'><b>husband</b></font>). I believe I may assert that they were really in possession of deep
and growing happiness.

<p/>It ended. Well, we _must_ be for ourselves in the long run; the mild and
generous are only more justly selfish than the domineering; and it ended
when circumstances caused each to feel that the one's interest was not
the chief consideration in the other's thoughts. On a mellow evening in
September, I was coming from the garden with a heavy basket of apples
which I had been gathering. It had got dusk, and the moon looked over
the high wall of the court, causing undefined shadows to lurk in the
corners of the numerous projecting portions of the building. I set my
burden on the house-steps by the kitchen-door, and lingered to rest, and
drew in a few more breaths of the soft, sweet air; my eyes were on the
moon, and my back to the entrance, when I heard a voice behind me
say,--<div class="bookquote">``Nelly, is that you?''

 (<font color='red'><b>me</b></font>)</div><p/>It was a deep voice, and foreign in tone; yet there was something in the
manner of pronouncing my name which made it sound familiar. I turned
about to discover who spoke, fearfully; for the doors were shut, and I
had seen nobody on approaching the steps. Something stirred in the
porch; and, moving nearer, I distinguished a tall man dressed in dark
clothes, with dark face and hair. He (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) leant against the side, and held
his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) fingers on the latch as if intending to open for himself. <div class="bookquote">``Who can
it be?''  (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div>I thought. <div class="bookquote">``Mr. Earnshaw? Oh, no! The voice has no resemblance
to his (<font color='blue'><b>Earnshaw</b></font>).''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I have waited here an hour,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) resumed, while I continued staring; `and
the whole of that time all round has been as still as death. I dared not
enter. You do not know me? Look, I'm not a stranger!''

<p/>A ray fell on his (<font color='blue'><b>stranger</b></font>) features; the cheeks were sallow, and half covered with
black whiskers; the brows lowering, the eyes deep-set and singular. I
remembered the eyes.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``What!''  (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div>I cried, uncertain whether to regard him (<font color='blue'><b>stranger</b></font>) as a worldly visitor,
and I raised my hands in amazement. <div class="bookquote">``What! you come back? Is it really
you? Is it?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Yes, Heathcliff,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>stranger</b></font>) replied, glancing from me up to the windows, which
reflected a score of glittering moons, but showed no lights from within.
<div class="bookquote">``Are they at home? where is she (<font color='blue'><b>Earnshaw</b></font>)? Nelly, you are not glad! you needn't be
so disturbed. Is she (<font color='blue'><b>Earnshaw</b></font>) here? Speak! I want to have one word with
her (<font color='blue'><b>Earnshaw</b></font>)--your mistress. Go, and say some person from Gimmerton desires to
see her (<font color='blue'><b>Earnshaw</b></font>).''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``How will she (<font color='blue'><b>Earnshaw</b></font>) take it?''  (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div>I exclaimed. <div class="bookquote">``What will she (<font color='blue'><b>Earnshaw</b></font>) do? The surprise
bewilders me--it will put her (<font color='blue'><b>Earnshaw</b></font>) out of her (<font color='blue'><b>Earnshaw</b></font>) head! And you _are_ Heathcliff!
But altered! Nay, there's no comprehending it. Have you been for a
soldier?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Go and carry my message,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>stranger</b></font>) interrupted, impatiently. <div class="bookquote">``I'm in hell
till you do!''

 (<font color='red'><b>He</b></font>)</div><p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>stranger</b></font>) lifted the latch, and I entered; but when I got to the parlour where
Mr. and Mrs. Linton were, I could not persuade myself to proceed. At
length I resolved on making an excuse to ask if they would have the
candles lighted, and I opened the door.

<p/>They sat together in a window whose lattice lay back against the wall,
and displayed, beyond the garden trees, and the wild green park, the
valley of Gimmerton, with a long line of mist winding nearly to its top
-LRB-for very soon after you pass the chapel, as you may have noticed, the
sough that runs from the marshes joins a beck which follows the bend of
the glen-RRB-. Wuthering Heights rose above this silvery vapour; but our old
house was invisible; it rather dips down on the other side. Both the
room and its occupants, and the scene they gazed on, looked wondrously
peaceful. I shrank reluctantly from performing my errand; and was
actually going away leaving it unsaid, after having put my question about
the candles, when a sense of my folly compelled me to return, and mutter,
``A person from Gimmerton wishes to see you ma<div class="bookquote">``am.''

 (<font color='red'><b>me</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``What does he (<font color='blue'><b>soldier</b></font>) want?''  (<font color='red'><b>Linton/Mrs. Linton/Mrs. Heathcliff</b></font>)</div>asked Mrs. Linton.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``I did not question him (<font color='blue'><b>soldier</b></font>),''  (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div>I answered.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Well, close the curtains, Nelly,''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Linton</b></font>) said; `and bring up tea. I'll be
back again directly.''

<p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>Linton</b></font>) quitted the apartment; Mr. Edgar inquired, carelessly, who it was.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Some one mistress does not expect,''  (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div>I replied. ``That Heathcliff--you
recollect him (<font color='blue'><b>Nelly</b></font>), sir--who used to live at Mr. Earnshaw<div class="bookquote">``s.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``What! the gipsy--the ploughboy?''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Edgar</b></font>) cried. <div class="bookquote">``Why did you not say so to
Catherine?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Hush! you must not call him (<font color='blue'><b>Earnshaw</b></font>) by those names, master,''  (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div>I said. <div class="bookquote">``She (<font color='blue'><b>Catherine</b></font>)'d be
sadly grieved to hear you. She (<font color='blue'><b>Catherine</b></font>) was nearly heartbroken when he (<font color='blue'><b>Earnshaw</b></font>) ran off. I
guess his (<font color='blue'><b>Earnshaw</b></font>) return will make a jubilee to her (<font color='blue'><b>Catherine</b></font>).''

 (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Linton</b></font>)</div><p/>Mr. Linton walked to a window on the other side of the room that
overlooked the court. He (<font color='blue'><b>Linton</b></font>) unfastened it, and leant out. I suppose they
were below, for he (<font color='blue'><b>Linton</b></font>) exclaimed quickly: <div class="bookquote">``Don't stand there, love! Bring
the person in, if it be anyone particular.''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>Ere long, I heard the click
of the latch, and Catherine flew up-stairs, breathless and wild; too
excited to show gladness: indeed, by her (<font color='blue'><b>Catherine</b></font>) face, you would rather have
surmised an awful calamity.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Oh, Edgar, Edgar!''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Catherine</b></font>) panted, flinging her (<font color='blue'><b>Catherine</b></font>) arms round his (<font color='blue'><b>Linton</b></font>) neck. <div class="bookquote">``Oh,
Edgar darling! Heathcliff's come back--he (<font color='blue'><b>Heathcliff</b></font>) is!''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>And she (<font color='blue'><b>Catherine</b></font>) tightened her (<font color='blue'><b>Catherine</b></font>)
embrace to a squeeze.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Well, well,''  (<font color='red'><b>husband</b></font>)</div>cried her (<font color='blue'><b>Catherine</b></font>) husband, crossly, `don't strangle me for that! He (<font color='blue'><b>Linton</b></font>)
never struck me as such a marvellous treasure. There is no need to be
frantic!''

<p/><div class="bookquote">``I know you didn't like him (<font color='blue'><b>Heathcliff</b></font>),''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Catherine</b></font>) answered, repressing a little the
intensity of her (<font color='blue'><b>Catherine</b></font>) delight. <div class="bookquote">``Yet, for my sake, you must be friends now.
Shall I tell him (<font color='blue'><b>Heathcliff</b></font>) to come up?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Here,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Linton</b></font>) said, `into the parlour?''

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Where else?''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Catherine</b></font>) asked.

<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Linton</b></font>) looked vexed, and suggested the kitchen as a more suitable place for
him (<font color='blue'><b>Linton</b></font>). Mrs. Linton eyed him (<font color='blue'><b>Linton</b></font>) with a droll expression--half angry, half
laughing at his (<font color='blue'><b>Linton</b></font>) fastidiousness.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``No,''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Linton</b></font>) added, after a while; <div class="bookquote">``I cannot sit in the kitchen. Set two
tables here, Ellen: one for your master and Miss Isabella, being gentry;
the other for Heathcliff and myself, being of the lower orders. Will
that please you, dear? Or must I have a fire lighted elsewhere? If so,
give directions. I'll run down and secure my guest. I'm afraid the joy
is too great to be real!''

 (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div><p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>Linton</b></font>) was about to dart off again; but Edgar arrested her (<font color='blue'><b>Linton</b></font>).

<p/>'_You_ bid him (<font color='blue'><b>Edgar</b></font>) step up,<div class="bookquote">'' he (<font color='blue'><b>Edgar</b></font>) said, addressing me; `and, Catherine, try to
be glad, without being absurd. The whole household need not witness the
sight of your welcoming a runaway servant as a brother.''

 (<font color='red'><b>him</b></font>)</div><p/>I descended, and found Heathcliff waiting under the porch, evidently
anticipating an invitation to enter. He (<font color='blue'><b>Heathcliff</b></font>) followed my guidance without
waste of words, and I ushered him (<font color='blue'><b>Heathcliff</b></font>) into the presence of the master and
mistress, whose flushed cheeks betrayed signs of warm talking. But the
lady's glowed with another feeling when her (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) friend appeared at the door:
she (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) sprang forward, took both his (<font color='blue'><b>friend</b></font>) hands, and led him (<font color='blue'><b>friend</b></font>) to Linton; and then
she (<font color='blue'><b>Linton</b></font>) seized Linton's reluctant fingers and crushed them into his (<font color='blue'><b>friend</b></font>). Now,
fully revealed by the fire and candlelight, I was amazed, more than ever,
to behold the transformation of Heathcliff. He (<font color='blue'><b>Heathcliff</b></font>) had grown a tall,
athletic, well-formed man; beside whom my master seemed quite slender and
youth-like. His (<font color='blue'><b>master</b></font>) upright carriage suggested the idea of his (<font color='blue'><b>master</b></font>) having been
in the army. His (<font color='blue'><b>master</b></font>) countenance was much older in expression and decision
of feature than Mr. Linton's; it looked intelligent, and retained no
marks of former degradation. A half-civilised ferocity lurked yet in the
depressed brows and eyes full of black fire, but it was subdued; and his (<font color='blue'><b>Linton</b></font>)
manner was even dignified: quite divested of roughness, though stern for
grace. My master's surprise equalled or exceeded mine: he (<font color='blue'><b>master</b></font>) remained for a
minute at a loss how to address the ploughboy, as he (<font color='blue'><b>master</b></font>) had called him (<font color='blue'><b>master</b></font>).
Heathcliff dropped his (<font color='blue'><b>Heathcliff</b></font>) slight hand, and stood looking at him (<font color='blue'><b>Heathcliff</b></font>) coolly till
he (<font color='blue'><b>Heathcliff</b></font>) chose to speak.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Sit down, sir,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Heathcliff</b></font>) said, at length. <div class="bookquote">``Mrs. Linton, recalling old times,
would have me give you a cordial reception; and, of course, I am
gratified when anything occurs to please her (<font color='blue'><b>Linton</b></font>).''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``And I also,''  (<font color='red'><b>Heathcliff/Mr. Heathcliff</b></font>)</div>answered Heathcliff, `especially if it be anything in which
I have a part. I shall stay an hour or two willingly.''

<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Heathcliff</b></font>) took a seat opposite Catherine, who kept her (<font color='blue'><b>Catherine</b></font>) gaze fixed on him (<font color='blue'><b>Heathcliff</b></font>) as if
she (<font color='blue'><b>Catherine</b></font>) feared he (<font color='blue'><b>Heathcliff</b></font>) would vanish were she (<font color='blue'><b>Catherine</b></font>) to remove it. He (<font color='blue'><b>Heathcliff</b></font>) did not raise his (<font color='blue'><b>Heathcliff</b></font>)
to her (<font color='blue'><b>Catherine</b></font>) often: a quick glance now and then sufficed; but it flashed back,
each time more confidently, the undisguised delight he (<font color='blue'><b>Heathcliff</b></font>) drank from hers.
They were too much absorbed in their mutual joy to suffer embarrassment.
Not so Mr. Edgar: he (<font color='blue'><b>Edgar</b></font>) grew pale with pure annoyance: a feeling that
reached its climax when his (<font color='blue'><b>Edgar</b></font>) lady rose, and stepping across the rug,
seized Heathcliff's hands again, and laughed like one beside herself.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``I shall think it a dream to-morrow!''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) cried. <div class="bookquote">``I shall not be able to
believe that I have seen, and touched, and spoken to you once more. And
yet, cruel Heathcliff! you don't deserve this welcome. To be absent and
silent for three years, and never to think of me!''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``A little more than you have thought of me,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Heathcliff</b></font>) murmured. <div class="bookquote">``I heard of
your marriage, Cathy, not long since; and, while waiting in the yard
below, I meditated this plan--just to have one glimpse of your face, a
stare of surprise, perhaps, and pretended pleasure; afterwards settle my
score with Hindley; and then prevent the law by doing execution on
myself. Your welcome has put these ideas out of my mind; but beware of
meeting me with another aspect next time! Nay, you'll not drive me off
again. You were really sorry for me, were you? Well, there was cause.
I've fought through a bitter life since I last heard your voice; and you
must forgive me, for I struggled only for you!''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Catherine, unless we are to have cold tea, please to come to the table,''
 (<font color='red'><b>Linton/Mrs. Linton/Mrs. Heathcliff</b></font>)</div>interrupted Linton, striving to preserve his (<font color='blue'><b>Heathcliff</b></font>) ordinary tone, and a due
measure of politeness. <div class="bookquote">``Mr. Heathcliff will have a long walk, wherever
he (<font color='blue'><b>Heathcliff</b></font>) may lodge to-night; and I'm thirsty.''

 (<font color='red'><b>She</b></font>)</div><p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>Linton</b></font>) took her (<font color='blue'><b>Linton</b></font>) post before the urn; and Miss Isabella came, summoned by the
bell; then, having handed their chairs forward, I left the room. The
meal hardly endured ten minutes. Catherine's cup was never filled: she (<font color='blue'><b>Catherine</b></font>)
could neither eat nor drink. Edgar had made a slop in his (<font color='blue'><b>Edgar</b></font>) saucer, and
scarcely swallowed a mouthful. Their guest did not protract his (<font color='blue'><b>guest</b></font>) stay
that evening above an hour longer. I asked, as he (<font color='blue'><b>guest</b></font>) departed, if he (<font color='blue'><b>guest</b></font>) went
to Gimmerton?

<p/><div class="bookquote">``No, to Wuthering Heights,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>guest</b></font>) answered: <div class="bookquote">``Mr. Earnshaw invited me, when I
called this morning.''

 (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div><p/>Mr. Earnshaw invited _him (<font color='blue'><b>Earnshaw</b></font>)_! and _he (<font color='blue'><b>Earnshaw</b></font>)_ called on Mr. Earnshaw! I pondered
this sentence painfully, after he (<font color='blue'><b>Earnshaw</b></font>) was gone. Is he (<font color='blue'><b>Earnshaw</b></font>) turning out a bit of a
hypocrite, and coming into the country to work mischief under a cloak? I
mused: I had a presentiment in the bottom of my heart that he (<font color='blue'><b>Earnshaw</b></font>) had better
have remained away.

<p/>About the middle of the night, I was wakened from my first nap by Mrs.
Linton gliding into my chamber, taking a seat on my bedside, and pulling
me by the hair to rouse me.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``I cannot rest, Ellen,''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Linton</b></font>) said, by way of apology. <div class="bookquote">``And I want some
living creature to keep me company in my happiness! Edgar is sulky,
because I'm glad of a thing that does not interest him (<font color='blue'><b>Edgar</b></font>): he (<font color='blue'><b>Edgar</b></font>) refuses to
open his (<font color='blue'><b>Edgar</b></font>) mouth, except to utter pettish, silly speeches; and he (<font color='blue'><b>Edgar</b></font>) affirmed
I was cruel and selfish for wishing to talk when he (<font color='blue'><b>Edgar</b></font>) was so sick and
sleepy. He (<font color='blue'><b>Edgar</b></font>) always contrives to be sick at the least cross! I gave a few
sentences of commendation to Heathcliff, and he (<font color='blue'><b>Heathcliff</b></font>), either for a headache or
a pang of envy, began to cry: so I got up and left him (<font color='blue'><b>Heathcliff</b></font>).''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``What use is it praising Heathcliff to him (<font color='blue'><b>Heathcliff</b></font>)?''  (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div>I answered. <div class="bookquote">``As lads they
had an aversion to each other, and Heathcliff would hate just as much to
hear him (<font color='blue'><b>Heathcliff</b></font>) praised: it's human nature. Let Mr. Linton alone about him (<font color='blue'><b>Linton</b></font>),
unless you would like an open quarrel between them.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``But does it not show great weakness?''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>pursued she (<font color='blue'><b>Linton</b></font>). <div class="bookquote">``I'm not envious: I
never feel hurt at the brightness of Isabella's yellow hair and the
whiteness of her (<font color='blue'><b>Isabella</b></font>) skin, at her (<font color='blue'><b>Isabella</b></font>) dainty elegance, and the fondness all the
family exhibit for her (<font color='blue'><b>Isabella</b></font>). Even you, Nelly, if we have a dispute sometimes,
you back Isabella at once; and I yield like a foolish mother: I call her (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>)
a darling, and flatter her (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) into a good temper. It pleases her (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) brother to
see us cordial, and that pleases me. But they are very much alike: they
are spoiled children, and fancy the world was made for their
accommodation; and though I humour both, I think a smart chastisement
might improve them all the same.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``You're mistaken, Mrs. Linton,''  (<font color='red'><b>I.</b></font>)</div>said I. <div class="bookquote">``They humour you: I know what
there would be to do if they did not. You can well afford to indulge
their passing whims as long as their business is to anticipate all your
desires. You may, however, fall out, at last, over something of equal
consequence to both sides; and then those you term weak are very capable
of being as obstinate as you.''

 (<font color='red'><b>I.</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``And then we shall fight to the death, sha'n't we, Nelly?''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Linton</b></font>) returned,
laughing. <div class="bookquote">``No! I tell you, I have such faith in Linton's love, that I
believe I might kill him (<font color='blue'><b>Nelly</b></font>), and he (<font color='blue'><b>Nelly</b></font>) wouldn't wish to retaliate.''

 (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div><p/>I advised her (<font color='blue'><b>Linton</b></font>) to value him (<font color='blue'><b>Earnshaw</b></font>) the more for his (<font color='blue'><b>Earnshaw</b></font>) affection.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``I do,''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Linton</b></font>) answered, `but he (<font color='blue'><b>Earnshaw</b></font>) needn't resort to whining for trifles. It
is childish and, instead of melting into tears because I said that
Heathcliff was now worthy of anyone's regard, and it would honour the
first gentleman in the country to be his (<font color='blue'><b>Heathcliff</b></font>) friend, he (<font color='blue'><b>Heathcliff</b></font>) ought to have said it
for me, and been delighted from sympathy. He (<font color='blue'><b>Heathcliff</b></font>) must get accustomed to him (<font color='blue'><b>Heathcliff</b></font>),
and he (<font color='blue'><b>Heathcliff</b></font>) may as well like him (<font color='blue'><b>Heathcliff</b></font>): considering how Heathcliff has reason to
object to him (<font color='blue'><b>Heathcliff</b></font>), I'm sure he (<font color='blue'><b>Heathcliff</b></font>) behaved excellently!''

<p/><div class="bookquote">``What do you think of his (<font color='blue'><b>Nelly</b></font>) going to Wuthering Heights?''  (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div>I inquired. <div class="bookquote">``He (<font color='blue'><b>Nelly</b></font>)
is reformed in every respect, apparently: quite a Christian: offering the
right hand of fellowship to his (<font color='blue'><b>Christian</b></font>) enemies all around!''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``He (<font color='blue'><b>Christian</b></font>) explained it,''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Heathcliff</b></font>) replied. <div class="bookquote">``I wonder as much as you. He (<font color='blue'><b>Christian</b></font>) said he (<font color='blue'><b>Christian</b></font>)
called to gather information concerning me from you, supposing you
resided there still; and Joseph told Hindley, who came out and fell to
questioning him (<font color='blue'><b>Joseph</b></font>) of what he (<font color='blue'><b>Joseph</b></font>) had been doing, and how he (<font color='blue'><b>Joseph</b></font>) had been living;
and finally, desired him (<font color='blue'><b>Joseph</b></font>) to walk in. There were some persons sitting at
cards; Heathcliff joined them; my brother lost some money to him (<font color='blue'><b>Heathcliff</b></font>), and,
finding him (<font color='blue'><b>Heathcliff</b></font>) plentifully supplied, he (<font color='blue'><b>Heathcliff</b></font>) requested that he (<font color='blue'><b>Heathcliff</b></font>) would come again
in the evening: to which he (<font color='blue'><b>Heathcliff</b></font>) consented. Hindley is too reckless to select
his (<font color='blue'><b>Hindley</b></font>) acquaintance prudently: he (<font color='blue'><b>Hindley</b></font>) doesn't trouble himself to reflect on the
causes he (<font color='blue'><b>Hindley</b></font>) might have for mistrusting one whom he (<font color='blue'><b>Hindley</b></font>) has basely injured. But
Heathcliff affirms his (<font color='blue'><b>Heathcliff</b></font>) principal reason for resuming a connection with
his (<font color='blue'><b>Heathcliff</b></font>) ancient persecutor is a wish to install himself in quarters at walking
distance from the Grange, and an attachment to the house where we lived
together; and likewise a hope that I shall have more opportunities of
seeing him (<font color='blue'><b>Heathcliff</b></font>) there than I could have if he (<font color='blue'><b>Heathcliff</b></font>) settled in Gimmerton. He (<font color='blue'><b>Heathcliff</b></font>) means
to offer liberal payment for permission to lodge at the Heights; and
doubtless my brother's covetousness will prompt him (<font color='blue'><b>brother</b></font>) to accept the terms:
he (<font color='blue'><b>brother</b></font>) was always greedy; though what he (<font color='blue'><b>brother</b></font>) grasps with one hand he (<font color='blue'><b>brother</b></font>) flings away
with the other.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``It's a nice place for a young man to fix his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) dwelling in!''  (<font color='red'><b>I.</b></font>)</div>said I. <div class="bookquote">``Have
you no fear of the consequences, Mrs. Linton?''

 (<font color='red'><b>I.</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``None for my friend,''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Heathcliff</b></font>) replied: `his (<font color='blue'><b>Heathcliff</b></font>) strong head will keep him (<font color='blue'><b>Heathcliff</b></font>) from
danger; a little for Hindley: but he (<font color='blue'><b>Hindley</b></font>) can't be made morally worse than he (<font color='blue'><b>Hindley</b></font>)
is; and I stand between him (<font color='blue'><b>Hindley</b></font>) and bodily harm. The event of this evening
has reconciled me to God and humanity! I had risen in angry rebellion
against Providence. Oh, I've endured very, very bitter misery, Nelly! If
that creature knew how bitter, he (<font color='blue'><b>Nelly</b></font>)'d be ashamed to cloud its removal with
idle petulance. It was kindness for him (<font color='blue'><b>Nelly</b></font>) which induced me to bear it
alone: had I expressed the agony I frequently felt, he (<font color='blue'><b>Nelly</b></font>) would have been
taught to long for its alleviation as ardently as I. However, it's over,
and I'll take no revenge on his (<font color='blue'><b>Nelly</b></font>) folly; I can afford to suffer anything
hereafter! Should the meanest thing alive slap me on the cheek, I'd not
only turn the other, but I'd ask pardon for provoking it; and, as a
proof, I'll go make my peace with Edgar instantly. Good-night! I'm an
angel!''

<p/>In this self-complacent conviction she (<font color='blue'><b>I</b></font>) departed; and the success of her (<font color='blue'><b>I</b></font>)
fulfilled resolution was obvious on the morrow: Mr. Linton had not only
abjured his (<font color='blue'><b>Linton</b></font>) peevishness -LRB-though his (<font color='blue'><b>Linton</b></font>) spirits seemed still subdued by
Catherine's exuberance of vivacity-RRB-, but he (<font color='blue'><b>Linton</b></font>) ventured no objection to her (<font color='blue'><b>Catherine</b></font>)
taking Isabella with her (<font color='blue'><b>Catherine</b></font>) to Wuthering Heights in the afternoon; and she (<font color='blue'><b>Catherine</b></font>)
rewarded him (<font color='blue'><b>Linton</b></font>) with such a summer of sweetness and affection in return as
made the house a paradise for several days; both master and servants
profiting from the perpetual sunshine.

<p/>Heathcliff--Mr. Heathcliff I should say in future--used the liberty of
visiting at Thrushcross Grange cautiously, at first: he (<font color='blue'><b>Heathcliff</b></font>) seemed estimating
how far its owner would bear his (<font color='blue'><b>Heathcliff</b></font>) intrusion. Catherine, also, deemed it
judicious to moderate her (<font color='blue'><b>Catherine</b></font>) expressions of pleasure in receiving him (<font color='blue'><b>Heathcliff</b></font>); and
he (<font color='blue'><b>Heathcliff</b></font>) gradually established his (<font color='blue'><b>Heathcliff</b></font>) right to be expected. He (<font color='blue'><b>Heathcliff</b></font>) retained a great
deal of the reserve for which his (<font color='blue'><b>Heathcliff</b></font>) boyhood was remarkable; and that served
to repress all startling demonstrations of feeling. My master's
uneasiness experienced a lull, and further circumstances diverted it into
another channel for a space.

<p/>His (<font color='blue'><b>master</b></font>) new source of trouble sprang from the not anticipated misfortune of
Isabella Linton evincing a sudden and irresistible attraction towards the
tolerated guest. She (<font color='blue'><b>Linton</b></font>) was at that time a charming young lady of eighteen;
infantile in manners, though possessed of keen wit, keen feelings, and a
keen temper, too, if irritated. Her (<font color='blue'><b>Linton</b></font>) brother, who loved her (<font color='blue'><b>Linton</b></font>) tenderly, was
appalled at this fantastic preference. Leaving aside the degradation of
an alliance with a nameless man, and the possible fact that his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) property,
in default of heirs male, might pass into such a one's power, he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) had
sense to comprehend Heathcliff's disposition: to know that, though his (<font color='blue'><b>Heathcliff</b></font>)
exterior was altered, his (<font color='blue'><b>Heathcliff</b></font>) mind was unchangeable and unchanged. And he (<font color='blue'><b>Heathcliff</b></font>)
dreaded that mind: it revolted him (<font color='blue'><b>Heathcliff</b></font>): he (<font color='blue'><b>Heathcliff</b></font>) shrank forebodingly from the idea
of committing Isabella to its keeping. He (<font color='blue'><b>Heathcliff</b></font>) would have recoiled still more
had he (<font color='blue'><b>Heathcliff</b></font>) been aware that her (<font color='blue'><b>Isabella</b></font>) attachment rose unsolicited, and was bestowed
where it awakened no reciprocation of sentiment; for the minute he (<font color='blue'><b>Heathcliff</b></font>)
discovered its existence he (<font color='blue'><b>Heathcliff</b></font>) laid the blame on Heathcliff's deliberate
designing.

<p/>We had all remarked, during some time, that Miss Linton fretted and pined
over something. She (<font color='blue'><b>Linton</b></font>) grew cross and wearisome; snapping at and teasing
Catherine continually, at the imminent risk of exhausting her (<font color='blue'><b>Catherine</b></font>) limited
patience. We excused her (<font color='blue'><b>Catherine</b></font>), to a certain extent, on the plea of
ill-health: she (<font color='blue'><b>Catherine</b></font>) was dwindling and fading before our eyes. But one day,
when she (<font color='blue'><b>Catherine</b></font>) had been peculiarly wayward, rejecting her (<font color='blue'><b>Catherine</b></font>) breakfast,
complaining that the servants did not do what she (<font color='blue'><b>Catherine</b></font>) told them; that the
mistress would allow her (<font color='blue'><b>Catherine</b></font>) to be nothing in the house, and Edgar neglected
her (<font color='blue'><b>Catherine</b></font>); that she (<font color='blue'><b>Catherine</b></font>) had caught a cold with the doors being left open, and we
let the parlour fire go out on purpose to vex her (<font color='blue'><b>Catherine</b></font>), with a hundred yet
more frivolous accusations, Mrs. Linton peremptorily insisted that she (<font color='blue'><b>Linton</b></font>)
should get to bed; and, having scolded her (<font color='blue'><b>Linton</b></font>) heartily, threatened to send
for the doctor. Mention of Kenneth caused her (<font color='blue'><b>Linton</b></font>) to exclaim, instantly,
that her (<font color='blue'><b>Linton</b></font>) health was perfect, and it was only Catherine's harshness which
made her (<font color='blue'><b>Catherine</b></font>) unhappy.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``How can you say I am harsh, you naughty fondling?''  (<font color='red'><b>the mistress</b></font>)</div>cried the mistress,
amazed at the unreasonable assertion. <div class="bookquote">``You are surely losing your
reason. When have I been harsh, tell me?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Yesterday,''  (<font color='red'><b>Isabella/Isabella Linton/ISABELLA</b></font>)</div>sobbed Isabella, `and now!''

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Yesterday!''  (<font color='red'><b>sister-in-law</b></font>)</div>said her (<font color='blue'><b>Isabella</b></font>) sister-in-law. <div class="bookquote">``On what occasion?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``In our walk along the moor: you told me to ramble where I pleased, while
you sauntered on with Mr. Heathcliff!''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``And that's your notion of harshness?''  (<font color='red'><b>Catherine/Earnshaw/Catherine Earnshaw</b></font>)</div>said Catherine, laughing. <div class="bookquote">``It was
no hint that your company was superfluous? We didn't care whether you
kept with us or not; I merely thought Heathcliff's talk would have
nothing entertaining for your ears.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Oh, no,''  (<font color='red'><b>the lady</b></font>)</div>wept the young lady; `you wished me away, because you knew I
liked to be there!''

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Is she (<font color='blue'><b>Heathcliff</b></font>) sane?''  (<font color='red'><b>Linton/Mrs. Linton/Mrs. Heathcliff</b></font>)</div>asked Mrs. Linton, appealing to me. <div class="bookquote">``I'll repeat our
conversation, word for word, Isabella; and you point out any charm it
could have had for you.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I don't mind the conversation,''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Linton</b></font>) answered: ``I wanted to be with--'

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Well?''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>said Catherine, perceiving her (<font color='blue'><b>Catherine</b></font>) hesitate to complete the sentence.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``With him (<font color='blue'><b>Heathcliff</b></font>): and I won't be always sent off!''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Catherine</b></font>) continued, kindling up.
<div class="bookquote">``You are a dog in the manger, Cathy, and desire no one to be loved but
yourself!''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``You are an impertinent little monkey!''  (<font color='red'><b>Linton/Mrs. Linton/Mrs. Heathcliff</b></font>)</div>exclaimed Mrs. Linton, in
surprise. <div class="bookquote">``But I'll not believe this idiotcy! It is impossible that you
can covet the admiration of Heathcliff--that you consider him (<font color='blue'><b>Heathcliff</b></font>) an
agreeable person! I hope I have misunderstood you, Isabella?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``No, you have not,''  (<font color='red'><b>the girl</b></font>)</div>said the infatuated girl. <div class="bookquote">``I love him (<font color='blue'><b>Heathcliff</b></font>) more than ever
you loved Edgar, and he (<font color='blue'><b>Edgar</b></font>) might love me, if you would let him (<font color='blue'><b>Edgar</b></font>)!''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I wouldn't be you for a kingdom, then!''  (<font color='red'><b>Catherine/Earnshaw/Catherine Earnshaw</b></font>)</div>Catherine declared,
emphatically: and she (<font color='blue'><b>Catherine</b></font>) seemed to speak sincerely. ``Nelly, help me to
convince her (<font color='blue'><b>Isabella</b></font>) of her (<font color='blue'><b>Isabella</b></font>) madness. Tell her (<font color='blue'><b>Isabella</b></font>) what Heathcliff is: an unreclaimed
creature, without refinement, without cultivation; an arid wilderness of
furze and whinstone. I'd as soon put that little canary into the park on
a winter's day, as recommend you to bestow your heart on him (<font color='blue'><b>Heathcliff</b></font>)! It is
deplorable ignorance of his (<font color='blue'><b>Heathcliff</b></font>) character, child, and nothing else, which
makes that dream enter your head. Pray, don't imagine that he (<font color='blue'><b>Heathcliff</b></font>) conceals
depths of benevolence and affection beneath a stern exterior! He (<font color='blue'><b>Heathcliff</b></font>)'s not a
rough diamond--a pearl-containing oyster of a rustic: he (<font color='blue'><b>Heathcliff</b></font>)'s a fierce,
pitiless, wolfish man. I never say to him (<font color='blue'><b>Heathcliff</b></font>), ``Let this or that enemy
alone, because it would be ungenerous or cruel to harm them;'' I say, ``Let
them alone, because _I_ should hate them to be wronged:<div class="bookquote">'' and he (<font color='blue'><b>Catherine</b></font>)'d crush
you like a sparrow's egg, Isabella, if he (<font color='blue'><b>Catherine</b></font>) found you a troublesome charge.
I know he (<font color='blue'><b>Catherine</b></font>) couldn't love a Linton; and yet he (<font color='blue'><b>Catherine</b></font>)'d be quite capable of
marrying your fortune and expectations: avarice is growing with him (<font color='blue'><b>Catherine</b></font>) a
besetting sin. There's my picture: and I'm his (<font color='blue'><b>Catherine</b></font>) friend--so much so, that
had he (<font color='blue'><b>Catherine</b></font>) thought seriously to catch you, I should, perhaps, have held my
tongue, and let you fall into his (<font color='blue'><b>Catherine</b></font>) trap.''

 (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div><p/>Miss Linton regarded her (<font color='blue'><b>Linton</b></font>) sister-in-law with indignation.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``For shame! for shame!''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Linton</b></font>) repeated, angrily. <div class="bookquote">``You are worse than
twenty foes, you poisonous friend!''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Ah! you won't believe me, then?''  (<font color='red'><b>Catherine/Earnshaw/Catherine Earnshaw</b></font>)</div>said Catherine. <div class="bookquote">``You think I speak
from wicked selfishness?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I'm certain you do,''  (<font color='red'><b>Isabella/Isabella Linton/ISABELLA</b></font>)</div>retorted Isabella; `and I shudder at you!''

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Good!''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>cried the other. <div class="bookquote">``Try for yourself, if that be your spirit: I
have done, and yield the argument to your saucy insolence.'' (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>--

<p/><div class="bookquote">``And I must suffer for her (<font color='blue'><b>I</b></font>) egotism!''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Catherine</b></font>) sobbed, as Mrs. Linton left the
room. <div class="bookquote">``All, all is against me: she (<font color='blue'><b>I</b></font>) has blighted my single consolation.
But she (<font color='blue'><b>I</b></font>) uttered falsehoods, didn't she (<font color='blue'><b>I</b></font>)? Mr. Heathcliff is not a fiend:
he (<font color='blue'><b>Heathcliff</b></font>) has an honourable soul, and a true one, or how could he (<font color='blue'><b>Heathcliff</b></font>) remember her (<font color='blue'><b>I</b></font>)?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Banish him (<font color='blue'><b>Heathcliff</b></font>) from your thoughts, Miss,''  (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div>I said. ``He (<font color='blue'><b>Heathcliff</b></font>)'s a bird of bad omen:
no mate for you. Mrs. Linton spoke strongly, and yet I can't contradict
her (<font color='blue'><b>Linton</b></font>). She (<font color='blue'><b>Linton</b></font>) is better acquainted with his (<font color='blue'><b>Heathcliff</b></font>) heart than I, or any one besides;
and she (<font color='blue'><b>Linton</b></font>) never would represent him (<font color='blue'><b>Heathcliff</b></font>) as worse than he (<font color='blue'><b>Heathcliff</b></font>) is. Honest people
don't hide their deeds. How has he (<font color='blue'><b>Heathcliff</b></font>) been living? how has he (<font color='blue'><b>Heathcliff</b></font>) got rich? why
is he (<font color='blue'><b>Heathcliff</b></font>) staying at Wuthering Heights, the house of a man whom he (<font color='blue'><b>Heathcliff</b></font>) abhors?
They say Mr. Earnshaw is worse and worse since he (<font color='blue'><b>Earnshaw</b></font>) came. They sit up all
night together continually, and Hindley has been borrowing money on his (<font color='blue'><b>Hindley</b></font>)
land, and does nothing but play and drink: I heard only a week ago--it
was Joseph who told me--I met him (<font color='blue'><b>Joseph</b></font>) at Gimmerton: ``Nelly,'' he (<font color='blue'><b>Catherine</b></font>) said, ``we's

 (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``You are leagued with the rest, Ellen!''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Linton</b></font>) replied. <div class="bookquote">``I'll not listen to
your slanders. What malevolence you must have to wish to convince me
that there is no happiness in the world!''

 (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div><p/>Whether she (<font color='blue'><b>Linton</b></font>) would have got over this fancy if left to herself, or
persevered in nursing it perpetually, I cannot say: she (<font color='blue'><b>Linton</b></font>) had little time
to reflect. The day after, there was a justice-meeting at the next town;
my master was obliged to attend; and Mr. Heathcliff, aware of his (<font color='blue'><b>Heathcliff</b></font>)
absence, called rather earlier than usual. Catherine and Isabella were
sitting in the library, on hostile terms, but silent: the latter alarmed
at her (<font color='blue'><b>Catherine</b></font>) recent indiscretion, and the disclosure she (<font color='blue'><b>Catherine</b></font>) had made of her (<font color='blue'><b>Catherine</b></font>) secret
feelings in a transient fit of passion; the former, on mature
consideration, really offended with her (<font color='blue'><b>Catherine</b></font>) companion; and, if she (<font color='blue'><b>Catherine</b></font>) laughed
again at her (<font color='blue'><b>Catherine</b></font>) pertness, inclined to make it no laughing matter to her (<font color='blue'><b>Catherine</b></font>). She (<font color='blue'><b>Catherine</b></font>)
did laugh as she (<font color='blue'><b>Catherine</b></font>) saw Heathcliff pass the window. I was sweeping the
hearth, and I noticed a mischievous smile on her (<font color='blue'><b>Catherine</b></font>) lips. Isabella,
absorbed in her (<font color='blue'><b>Isabella</b></font>) meditations, or a book, remained till the door opened;
and it was too late to attempt an escape, which she (<font color='blue'><b>Isabella</b></font>) would gladly have
done had it been practicable.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Come in, that's right!''  (<font color='red'><b>the mistress</b></font>)</div>exclaimed the mistress, gaily, pulling a chair
to the fire. <div class="bookquote">``Here are two people sadly in need of a third to thaw the
ice between them; and you are the very one we should both of us choose.
Heathcliff, I'm proud to show you, at last, somebody that dotes on you
more than myself. I expect you to feel flattered. Nay, it's not Nelly;
don't look at her (<font color='blue'><b>you</b></font>)! My poor little sister-in-law is breaking her (<font color='blue'><b>you</b></font>) heart by
mere contemplation of your physical and moral beauty. It lies in your
own power to be Edgar's brother! No, no, Isabella, you sha'n't run off,''
 (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Isabella</b></font>) continued, arresting, with feigned playfulness, the confounded girl,
who had risen indignantly. <div class="bookquote">``We were quarrelling like cats about you,
Heathcliff; and I was fairly beaten in protestations of devotion and
admiration: and, moreover, I was informed that if I would but have the
manners to stand aside, my rival, as she (<font color='blue'><b>Isabella</b></font>) will have herself to be, would
shoot a shaft into your soul that would fix you for ever, and send my
image into eternal oblivion!''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Catherine!''  (<font color='red'><b>Isabella/Isabella Linton/ISABELLA</b></font>)</div>said Isabella, calling up her (<font color='blue'><b>Isabella</b></font>) dignity, and disdaining to
struggle from the tight grasp that held her (<font color='blue'><b>Isabella</b></font>), <div class="bookquote">``I'd thank you to adhere to
the truth and not slander me, even in joke! Mr. Heathcliff, be kind
enough to bid this friend of yours release me: she (<font color='blue'><b>Catherine</b></font>) forgets that you and I
are not intimate acquaintances; and what amuses her (<font color='blue'><b>Catherine</b></font>) is painful to me
beyond expression.''

 (<font color='red'><b>her</b></font>)</div><p/>As the guest answered nothing, but took his (<font color='blue'><b>guest</b></font>) seat, and looked thoroughly
indifferent what sentiments she (<font color='blue'><b>Isabella</b></font>) cherished concerning him (<font color='blue'><b>guest</b></font>), she (<font color='blue'><b>Isabella</b></font>) turned and
whispered an earnest appeal for liberty to her (<font color='blue'><b>Isabella</b></font>) tormentor.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``By no means!''  (<font color='red'><b>Linton/Mrs. Linton/Mrs. Heathcliff</b></font>)</div>cried Mrs. Linton in answer. <div class="bookquote">``I won't be named a dog in
the manger again. You _shall_ stay: now then! Heathcliff, why don't you
evince satisfaction at my pleasant news? Isabella swears that the love
Edgar has for me is nothing to that she (<font color='blue'><b>Isabella</b></font>) entertains for you. I'm sure she (<font color='blue'><b>Isabella</b></font>)
made some speech of the kind; did she (<font color='blue'><b>Isabella</b></font>) not, Ellen? And she (<font color='blue'><b>Isabella</b></font>) has fasted
ever since the day before yesterday's walk, from sorrow and rage that I
despatched her (<font color='blue'><b>Isabella</b></font>) out of your society under the idea of its being
unacceptable.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I think you belie her (<font color='blue'><b>Isabella</b></font>),''  (<font color='red'><b>Heathcliff/Mr. Heathcliff</b></font>)</div>said Heathcliff, twisting his (<font color='blue'><b>Heathcliff</b></font>) chair to face
them. <div class="bookquote">``She (<font color='blue'><b>Isabella</b></font>) wishes to be out of my society now, at any rate!''

 (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div><p/>And he (<font color='blue'><b>Heathcliff</b></font>) stared hard at the object of discourse, as one might do at a
strange repulsive animal: a centipede from the Indies, for instance,
which curiosity leads one to examine in spite of the aversion it raises.
The poor thing couldn't bear that; she (<font color='blue'><b>Isabella</b></font>) grew white and red in rapid
succession, and, while tears beaded her (<font color='blue'><b>Isabella</b></font>) lashes, bent the strength of her (<font color='blue'><b>Isabella</b></font>)
small fingers to loosen the firm clutch of Catherine; and perceiving that
as fast as she (<font color='blue'><b>Catherine</b></font>) raised one finger off her (<font color='blue'><b>Catherine</b></font>) arm another closed down, and she (<font color='blue'><b>Catherine</b></font>)
could not remove the whole together, she (<font color='blue'><b>Catherine</b></font>) began to make use of her (<font color='blue'><b>Catherine</b></font>) nails;
and their sharpness presently ornamented the detainer's with crescents of
red.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``There's a tigress!''  (<font color='red'><b>Linton/Mrs. Linton/Mrs. Heathcliff</b></font>)</div>exclaimed Mrs. Linton, setting her (<font color='blue'><b>Linton</b></font>) free, and shaking
her (<font color='blue'><b>Linton</b></font>) hand with pain. <div class="bookquote">``Begone, for God's sake, and hide your vixen face!
How foolish to reveal those talons to him (<font color='blue'><b>God</b></font>). Can't you fancy the
conclusions he (<font color='blue'><b>God</b></font>)'ll draw? Look, Heathcliff! they are instruments that will
do execution--you must beware of your eyes.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I'd wrench them off her (<font color='blue'><b>vixen</b></font>) fingers, if they ever menaced me,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Linton</b></font>) answered,
brutally, when the door had closed after her (<font color='blue'><b>Linton</b></font>). <div class="bookquote">``But what did you mean by
teasing the creature in that manner, Cathy? You were not speaking the
truth, were you?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I assure you I was,''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Linton</b></font>) returned. <div class="bookquote">``She (<font color='blue'><b>Cathy</b></font>) has been dying for your sake
several weeks, and raving about you this morning, and pouring forth a
deluge of abuse, because I represented your failings in a plain light,
for the purpose of mitigating her (<font color='blue'><b>Cathy</b></font>) adoration. But don't notice it
further: I wished to punish her (<font color='blue'><b>Cathy</b></font>) sauciness, that's all. I like her (<font color='blue'><b>Cathy</b></font>) too
well, my dear Heathcliff, to let you absolutely seize and devour her (<font color='blue'><b>Cathy</b></font>) up.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``And I like her (<font color='blue'><b>Cathy</b></font>) too ill to attempt it,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>said he (<font color='blue'><b>Linton</b></font>), `except in a very
ghoulish fashion. You'd hear of odd things if I lived alone with that
mawkish, waxen face: the most ordinary would be painting on its white the
colours of the rainbow, and turning the blue eyes black, every day or
two: they detestably resemble Linton<div class="bookquote">``s.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Linton/Mrs. Linton/Mrs. Heathcliff</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Delectably!''  (<font color='red'><b>Linton/Mrs. Linton/Mrs. Heathcliff</b></font>)</div>observed Catherine. ``They are dove's eyes--angel<div class="bookquote">``s!''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``She (<font color='blue'><b>Cathy</b></font>)'s her (<font color='blue'><b>Cathy</b></font>) brother's heir, is she (<font color='blue'><b>Cathy</b></font>) not?''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Linton</b></font>) asked, after a brief silence.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``I should be sorry to think so,''  (<font color='red'><b>companion</b></font>)</div>returned his (<font color='blue'><b>Linton</b></font>) companion. <div class="bookquote">``Half a dozen
nephews shall erase her (<font color='blue'><b>Cathy</b></font>) title, please heaven! Abstract your mind from
the subject at present: you are too prone to covet your neighbour's
goods; remember _this_ neighbour's goods are mine.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``If they were _mine_, they would be none the less that,''  (<font color='red'><b>Heathcliff/Mr. Heathcliff</b></font>)</div>said Heathcliff;
`but though Isabella Linton may be silly, she (<font color='blue'><b>Linton</b></font>) is scarcely mad; and, in
short, we'll dismiss the matter, as you advise.''

<p/>From their tongues they did dismiss it; and Catherine, probably, from her (<font color='blue'><b>Catherine</b></font>)
thoughts. The other, I felt certain, recalled it often in the course of
the evening. I saw him (<font color='blue'><b>Linton</b></font>) smile to himself--grin rather--and lapse into
ominous musing whenever Mrs. Linton had occasion to be absent from the
apartment.

<p/>I determined to watch his (<font color='blue'><b>Linton</b></font>) movements. My heart invariably cleaved to the
master's, in preference to Catherine's side: with reason I imagined, for
he (<font color='blue'><b>Linton</b></font>) was kind, and trustful, and honourable; and she (<font color='blue'><b>Catherine</b></font>)--she (<font color='blue'><b>Catherine</b></font>) could not be
called _opposite_, yet she (<font color='blue'><b>Catherine</b></font>) seemed to allow herself such wide latitude,
that I had little faith in her (<font color='blue'><b>Catherine</b></font>) principles, and still less sympathy for
her (<font color='blue'><b>Catherine</b></font>) feelings. I wanted something to happen which might have the effect
of freeing both Wuthering Heights and the Grange of Mr. Heathcliff
quietly; leaving us as we had been prior to his (<font color='blue'><b>Heathcliff</b></font>) advent. His (<font color='blue'><b>Heathcliff</b></font>) visits were
a continual nightmare to me; and, I suspected, to my master also. His (<font color='blue'><b>master</b></font>)
abode at the Heights was an oppression past explaining. I felt that God
had forsaken the stray sheep there to its own wicked wanderings, and an
evil beast prowled between it and the fold, waiting his (<font color='blue'><b>God</b></font>) time to spring
and destroy.




<p/>CHAPTER XI


<p/>Sometimes, while meditating on these things in solitude, I've got up in a
sudden terror, and put on my bonnet to go see how all was at the farm.
I've persuaded my conscience that it was a duty to warn him (<font color='blue'><b>God</b></font>) how people
talked regarding his (<font color='blue'><b>God</b></font>) ways; and then I've recollected his (<font color='blue'><b>God</b></font>) confirmed bad
habits, and, hopeless of benefiting him (<font color='blue'><b>God</b></font>), have flinched from re-entering
the dismal house, doubting if I could bear to be taken at my word.

<p/>One time I passed the old gate, going out of my way, on a journey to
Gimmerton. It was about the period that my narrative has reached: a
bright frosty afternoon; the ground bare, and the road hard and dry. I
came to a stone where the highway branches off on to the moor at your
left hand; a rough sand-pillar, with the letters W. H. cut on its north
side, on the east, G., and on the south-west, T. G. It serves as a
guide-post to the Grange, the Heights, and village. The sun shone yellow
on its grey head, reminding me of summer; and I cannot say why, but all
at once a gush of child's sensations flowed into my heart. Hindley and I
held it a favourite spot twenty years before. I gazed long at the
weather-worn block; and, stooping down, perceived a hole near the bottom
still full of snail-shells and pebbles, which we were fond of storing
there with more perishable things; and, as fresh as reality, it appeared
that I beheld my early playmate seated on the withered turf: his (<font color='blue'><b>Hindley</b></font>) dark,
square head bent forward, and his (<font color='blue'><b>Hindley</b></font>) little hand scooping out the earth
with a piece of slate. <div class="bookquote">``Poor Hindley!''  (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div>I exclaimed, involuntarily. I
started: my bodily eye was cheated into a momentary belief that the
child lifted its face and stared straight into mine! It vanished in a
twinkling; but immediately I felt an irresistible yearning to be at the
Heights. Superstition urged me to comply with this impulse: supposing he (<font color='blue'><b>Hindley</b></font>)
should be dead! I thought--or should die soon!--supposing it were a sign
of death! The nearer I got to the house the more agitated I grew; and on
catching sight of it I trembled in every limb. The apparition had
outstripped me: it stood looking through the gate. That was my first
idea on observing an elf-locked, brown-eyed boy setting his (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>) ruddy
countenance against the bars. Further reflection suggested this must be
Hareton, _my_ Hareton, not altered greatly since I left him (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>), ten months
since.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``God bless thee, darling!''  (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div>I cried, forgetting instantaneously my
foolish fears. <div class="bookquote">``Hareton, it's Nelly! Nelly, thy nurse.''

 (<font color='red'><b>He</b></font>)</div><p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>) retreated out of arm's length, and picked up a large flint.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``I am come to see thy father, Hareton,''  (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div>I added, guessing from the
action that Nelly, if she (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>) lived in his (<font color='blue'><b>Nelly</b></font>) memory at all, was not recognised
as one with me.

<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Nelly</b></font>) raised his (<font color='blue'><b>Nelly</b></font>) missile to hurl it; I commenced a soothing speech, but
could not stay his (<font color='blue'><b>Nelly</b></font>) hand: the stone struck my bonnet; and then ensued,
from the stammering lips of the little fellow, a string of curses, which,
whether he (<font color='blue'><b>fellow</b></font>) comprehended them or not, were delivered with practised
emphasis, and distorted his (<font color='blue'><b>fellow</b></font>) baby features into a shocking expression of
malignity. You may be certain this grieved more than angered me. Fit to
cry, I took an orange from my pocket, and offered it to propitiate him (<font color='blue'><b>fellow</b></font>).
He (<font color='blue'><b>fellow</b></font>) hesitated, and then snatched it from my hold; as if he (<font color='blue'><b>fellow</b></font>) fancied I only
intended to tempt and disappoint him (<font color='blue'><b>fellow</b></font>). I showed another, keeping it out
of his (<font color='blue'><b>fellow</b></font>) reach.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Who has taught you those fine words, my bairn?''  (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div>I inquired. <div class="bookquote">``The
curate?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Damn the curate, and thee! Gie me that,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>fellow</b></font>) replied.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Tell us where you got your lessons, and you shall have it,''  (<font color='red'><b>I.</b></font>)</div>said I.
<div class="bookquote">``Who's your master?''

 (<font color='red'><b>I.</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Devil daddy,''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>was his (<font color='blue'><b>fellow</b></font>) answer.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``And what do you learn from daddy?''  (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div>I continued.

<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>fellow</b></font>) jumped at the fruit; I raised it higher. <div class="bookquote">``What does he (<font color='blue'><b>daddy</b></font>) teach you?''  (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div>I
asked.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Naught,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>said he (<font color='blue'><b>fellow</b></font>), `but to keep out of his (<font color='blue'><b>fellow</b></font>) gait. Daddy cannot bide me,
because I swear at him (<font color='blue'><b>fellow</b></font>).''

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Ah! and the devil teaches you to swear at daddy?''  (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div>I observed.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Ay--nay,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>fellow</b></font>) drawled.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Who, then?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Heathcliff.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I asked if he (<font color='blue'><b>daddy</b></font>) liked Mr. Heathcliff.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Ay!''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>fellow</b></font>) answered again.

<p/>Desiring to have his (<font color='blue'><b>fellow</b></font>) reasons for liking him (<font color='blue'><b>fellow</b></font>), I could only gather the
sentences--<div class="bookquote">``I known't: he (<font color='blue'><b>daddy</b></font>) pays dad back what he (<font color='blue'><b>daddy</b></font>) gies to me--he (<font color='blue'><b>daddy</b></font>) curses
daddy for cursing me. He (<font color='blue'><b>daddy</b></font>) says I mun do as I will.''

 (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``And the curate does not teach you to read and write, then?''  (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div>I pursued.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``No, I was told the curate should have his (<font color='blue'><b>daddy</b></font>)--teeth dashed down his (<font color='blue'><b>daddy</b></font>)--throat,
if he (<font color='blue'><b>daddy</b></font>) stepped over the threshold--Heathcliff had promised that!''

 (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div><p/>I put the orange in his (<font color='blue'><b>fellow</b></font>) hand, and bade him (<font color='blue'><b>fellow</b></font>) tell his (<font color='blue'><b>fellow</b></font>) father that a woman
called Nelly Dean was waiting to speak with him (<font color='blue'><b>fellow</b></font>), by the garden gate. He (<font color='blue'><b>fellow</b></font>)
went up the walk, and entered the house; but, instead of Hindley,
Heathcliff appeared on the door-stones; and I turned directly and ran
down the road as hard as ever I could race, making no halt till I gained
the guide-post, and feeling as scared as if I had raised a goblin. This
is not much connected with Miss Isabella's affair: except that it urged
me to resolve further on mounting vigilant guard, and doing my utmost to
check the spread of such bad influence at the Grange: even though I
should wake a domestic storm, by thwarting Mrs. Linton's pleasure.

<p/>The next time Heathcliff came my young lady chanced to be feeding some
pigeons in the court. She (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) had never spoken a word to her (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) sister-in-law
for three days; but she (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) had likewise dropped her (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) fretful complaining, and
we found it a great comfort. Heathcliff had not the habit of bestowing a
single unnecessary civility on Miss Linton, I knew. Now, as soon as he (<font color='blue'><b>Heathcliff</b></font>)
beheld her (<font color='blue'><b>Linton</b></font>), his (<font color='blue'><b>Heathcliff</b></font>) first precaution was to take a sweeping survey of the
house-front. I was standing by the kitchen-window, but I drew out of
sight. He (<font color='blue'><b>Heathcliff</b></font>) then stepped across the pavement to her (<font color='blue'><b>Linton</b></font>), and said something:
she (<font color='blue'><b>Linton</b></font>) seemed embarrassed, and desirous of getting away; to prevent it, he (<font color='blue'><b>Heathcliff</b></font>)
laid his (<font color='blue'><b>Heathcliff</b></font>) hand on her (<font color='blue'><b>Linton</b></font>) arm. She (<font color='blue'><b>Linton</b></font>) averted her (<font color='blue'><b>Linton</b></font>) face: he (<font color='blue'><b>Heathcliff</b></font>) apparently put some
question which she (<font color='blue'><b>Linton</b></font>) had no mind to answer. There was another rapid glance
at the house, and supposing himself unseen, the scoundrel had the
impudence to embrace her (<font color='blue'><b>Linton</b></font>).

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Judas! Traitor!''  (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div>I ejaculated. <div class="bookquote">``You are a hypocrite, too, are you? A
deliberate deceiver.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Who is, Nelly?''  (<font color='red'><b>Catherine/Earnshaw/Catherine Earnshaw</b></font>)</div>said Catherine's voice at my elbow: I had been
over-intent on watching the pair outside to mark her (<font color='blue'><b>Catherine</b></font>) entrance.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Your worthless friend!''  (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div>I answered, warmly: `the sneaking rascal yonder.
Ah, he (<font color='blue'><b>scoundrel</b></font>) has caught a glimpse of us--he (<font color='blue'><b>scoundrel</b></font>) is coming in! I wonder will he (<font color='blue'><b>scoundrel</b></font>)
have the heart to find a plausible excuse for making love to Miss, when
he (<font color='blue'><b>scoundrel</b></font>) told you he (<font color='blue'><b>scoundrel</b></font>) hated her (<font color='blue'><b>Catherine</b></font>)?''

<p/>Mrs. Linton saw Isabella tear herself free, and run into the garden; and
a minute after, Heathcliff opened the door. I couldn't withhold giving
some loose to my indignation; but Catherine angrily insisted on silence,
and threatened to order me out of the kitchen, if I dared to be so
presumptuous as to put in my insolent tongue.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``To hear you, people might think you were the mistress!''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Catherine</b></font>) cried. <div class="bookquote">``You
want setting down in your right place! Heathcliff, what are you about,
raising this stir? I said you must let Isabella alone!--I beg you will,
unless you are tired of being received here, and wish Linton to draw the
bolts against you!''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``God forbid that he (<font color='blue'><b>God</b></font>) should try!''  (<font color='red'><b>the villain</b></font>)</div>answered the black villain. I detested
him (<font color='blue'><b>villain</b></font>) just then. <div class="bookquote">``God keep him (<font color='blue'><b>God</b></font>) meek and patient! Every day I grow madder
after sending him (<font color='blue'><b>God</b></font>) to heaven!''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Hush!''  (<font color='red'><b>Catherine/Earnshaw/Catherine Earnshaw</b></font>)</div>said Catherine, shutting the inner door! <div class="bookquote">``Don't vex me. Why
have you disregarded my request? Did she (<font color='blue'><b>Linton</b></font>) come across you on purpose?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``What is it to you?''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>villain</b></font>) growled. <div class="bookquote">``I have a right to kiss her (<font color='blue'><b>Linton</b></font>), if she (<font color='blue'><b>Linton</b></font>)
chooses; and you have no right to object. I am not _your_ husband: _you_
needn't be jealous of me!''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I'm not jealous of you,''  (<font color='red'><b>the mistress</b></font>)</div>replied the mistress; ``I'm jealous for you.
Clear your face: you sha'n't scowl at me! If you like Isabella, you
shall marry her (<font color='blue'><b>Isabella</b></font>). But do you like her (<font color='blue'><b>Isabella</b></font>)? Tell the truth, Heathcliff!
There, you won't answer. I'm certain you don<div class="bookquote">``t.''

 (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``And would Mr. Linton approve of his (<font color='blue'><b>Linton</b></font>) sister marrying that man?''  (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div>I
inquired.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Mr. Linton should approve,''  (<font color='red'><b>lady</b></font>)</div>returned my lady, decisively.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``He (<font color='blue'><b>Linton</b></font>) might spare himself the trouble,''  (<font color='red'><b>Heathcliff/Mr. Heathcliff</b></font>)</div>said Heathcliff: <div class="bookquote">``I could do as
well without his (<font color='blue'><b>Linton</b></font>) approbation. And as to you, Catherine, I have a mind to
speak a few words now, while we are at it. I want you to be aware that I
_know_ you have treated me infernally--infernally! Do you hear? And if
you flatter yourself that I don't perceive it, you are a fool; and if
you think I can be consoled by sweet words, you are an idiot: and if you
fancy I'll suffer unrevenged, I'll convince you of the contrary, in a
very little while! Meantime, thank you for telling me your
sister-in-law's secret: I swear I'll make the most of it. And stand you
aside!''

 (<font color='red'><b>Heathcliff/Mr. Heathcliff</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``What new phase of his (<font color='blue'><b>idiot</b></font>) character is this?''  (<font color='red'><b>Linton/Mrs. Linton/Mrs. Heathcliff</b></font>)</div>exclaimed Mrs. Linton, in
amazement. <div class="bookquote">``I've treated you infernally--and you'll take your revenge!
How will you take it, ungrateful brute? How have I treated you
infernally?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I seek no revenge on you,''  (<font color='red'><b>Heathcliff/Mr. Heathcliff</b></font>)</div>replied Heathcliff, less vehemently. <div class="bookquote">``That's
not the plan. The tyrant grinds down his (<font color='blue'><b>tyrant</b></font>) slaves and they don't turn
against him (<font color='blue'><b>tyrant</b></font>); they crush those beneath them. You are welcome to torture
me to death for your amusement, only allow me to amuse myself a little in
the same style, and refrain from insult as much as you are able. Having
levelled my palace, don't erect a hovel and complacently admire your own
charity in giving me that for a home. If I imagined you really wished me
to marry Isabel, I'd cut my throat!''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Oh, the evil is that I am _not_ jealous, is it?''  (<font color='red'><b>Catherine/Earnshaw/Catherine Earnshaw</b></font>)</div>cried Catherine. <div class="bookquote">``Well,
I won't repeat my offer of a wife: it is as bad as offering Satan a lost
soul. Your bliss lies, like his (<font color='blue'><b>Satan</b></font>), in inflicting misery. You prove it.
Edgar is restored from the ill-temper he (<font color='blue'><b>Edgar</b></font>) gave way to at your coming; I
begin to be secure and tranquil; and you, restless to know us at peace,
appear resolved on exciting a quarrel. Quarrel with Edgar, if you
please, Heathcliff, and deceive his (<font color='blue'><b>Heathcliff</b></font>) sister: you'll hit on exactly the
most efficient method of revenging yourself on me.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/>The conversation ceased. Mrs. Linton sat down by the fire, flushed and
gloomy. The spirit which served her (<font color='blue'><b>Linton</b></font>) was growing intractable: she (<font color='blue'><b>Linton</b></font>) could
neither lay nor control it. He (<font color='blue'><b>Heathcliff</b></font>) stood on the hearth with folded arms,
brooding on his (<font color='blue'><b>Heathcliff</b></font>) evil thoughts; and in this position I left them to seek
the master, who was wondering what kept Catherine below so long.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Ellen,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>said he (<font color='blue'><b>Heathcliff</b></font>), when I entered, `have you seen your mistress?''

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Yes; she (<font color='blue'><b>Ellen</b></font>)'s in the kitchen, sir,''  (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div>I answered. <div class="bookquote">``She (<font color='blue'><b>Ellen</b></font>)'s sadly put out by
Mr. Heathcliff's behaviour: and, indeed, I do think it's time to arrange
his (<font color='blue'><b>Heathcliff</b></font>) visits on another footing. There's harm in being too soft, and now
it's come to this--.''  (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div>And I related the scene in the court, and, as near
as I dared, the whole subsequent dispute. I fancied it could not be very
prejudicial to Mrs. Linton; unless she (<font color='blue'><b>Linton</b></font>) made it so afterwards, by assuming
the defensive for her (<font color='blue'><b>Linton</b></font>) guest. Edgar Linton had difficulty in hearing me
to the close. His (<font color='blue'><b>Linton</b></font>) first words revealed that he (<font color='blue'><b>Linton</b></font>) did not clear his (<font color='blue'><b>Linton</b></font>) wife of
blame.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``This is insufferable!''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Linton</b></font>) exclaimed. <div class="bookquote">``It is disgraceful that she (<font color='blue'><b>Ellen</b></font>) should
own him (<font color='blue'><b>Heathcliff</b></font>) for a friend, and force his (<font color='blue'><b>Heathcliff</b></font>) company on me! Call me two men out
of the hall, Ellen. Catherine shall linger no longer to argue with the
low ruffian--I have humoured her (<font color='blue'><b>Catherine</b></font>) enough.''

 (<font color='red'><b>He</b></font>)</div><p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Linton</b></font>) descended, and bidding the servants wait in the passage, went,
followed by me, to the kitchen. Its occupants had recommenced their
angry discussion: Mrs. Linton, at least, was scolding with renewed
vigour; Heathcliff had moved to the window, and hung his (<font color='blue'><b>Heathcliff</b></font>) head, somewhat
cowed by her (<font color='blue'><b>Linton</b></font>) violent rating apparently. He (<font color='blue'><b>Heathcliff</b></font>) saw the master first, and
made a hasty motion that she (<font color='blue'><b>Linton</b></font>) should be silent; which she (<font color='blue'><b>Linton</b></font>) obeyed,
abruptly, on discovering the reason of his (<font color='blue'><b>Heathcliff</b></font>) intimation.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``How is this?''  (<font color='red'><b>Linton/Mrs. Linton/Mrs. Heathcliff</b></font>)</div>said Linton, addressing her (<font color='blue'><b>Linton</b></font>); `what notion of propriety
must you have to remain here, after the language which has been held to
you by that blackguard? I suppose, because it is his (<font color='blue'><b>Heathcliff</b></font>) ordinary talk you
think nothing of it: you are habituated to his (<font color='blue'><b>Heathcliff</b></font>) baseness, and, perhaps,
imagine I can get used to it too!''

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Have you been listening at the door, Edgar?''  (<font color='red'><b>the mistress</b></font>)</div>asked the mistress, in a
tone particularly calculated to provoke her (<font color='blue'><b>mistress</b></font>) husband, implying both
carelessness and contempt of his (<font color='blue'><b>husband</b></font>) irritation. Heathcliff, who had raised
his (<font color='blue'><b>Heathcliff</b></font>) eyes at the former speech, gave a sneering laugh at the latter; on
purpose, it seemed, to draw Mr. Linton's attention to him (<font color='blue'><b>Linton</b></font>). He (<font color='blue'><b>Linton</b></font>) succeeded;
but Edgar did not mean to entertain him (<font color='blue'><b>Edgar</b></font>) with any high flights of passion.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``I've been so far forbearing with you, sir,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Edgar</b></font>) said quietly; `not that I
was ignorant of your miserable, degraded character, but I felt you were
only partly responsible for that; and Catherine wishing to keep up your
acquaintance, I acquiesced--foolishly. Your presence is a moral poison
that would contaminate the most virtuous: for that cause, and to prevent
worse consequences, I shall deny you hereafter admission into this house,
and give notice now that I require your instant departure. Three
minutes' delay will render it involuntary and ignominious.

<p/>Heathcliff measured the height and breadth of the speaker with an eye
full of derision.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Cathy, this lamb of yours threatens like a bull!''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Heathcliff</b></font>) said. <div class="bookquote">``It is in
danger of splitting its skull against my knuckles. By God! Mr. Linton,
I'm mortally sorry that you are not worth knocking down!''

 (<font color='red'><b>master</b></font>)</div><p/>My master glanced towards the passage, and signed me to fetch the men: he (<font color='blue'><b>Heathcliff</b></font>)
had no intention of hazarding a personal encounter. I obeyed the hint;
but Mrs. Linton, suspecting something, followed; and when I attempted to
call them, she (<font color='blue'><b>Linton</b></font>) pulled me back, slammed the door to, and locked it.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Fair means!''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Linton</b></font>) said, in answer to her (<font color='blue'><b>Linton</b></font>) husband's look of angry
surprise. <div class="bookquote">``If you have not courage to attack him (<font color='blue'><b>Linton</b></font>), make an apology, or
allow yourself to be beaten. It will correct you of feigning more valour
than you possess. No, I'll swallow the key before you shall get it! I'm
delightfully rewarded for my kindness to each! After constant indulgence
of one's weak nature, and the other's bad one, I earn for thanks two
samples of blind ingratitude, stupid to absurdity! Edgar, I was
defending you and yours; and I wish Heathcliff may flog you sick, for
daring to think an evil thought of me!''

 (<font color='red'><b>the master</b></font>)</div><p/>It did not need the medium of a flogging to produce that effect on the
master. He (<font color='blue'><b>master</b></font>) tried to wrest the key from Catherine's grasp, and for safety
she (<font color='blue'><b>Catherine</b></font>) flung it into the hottest part of the fire; whereupon Mr. Edgar was
taken with a nervous trembling, and his (<font color='blue'><b>Edgar</b></font>) countenance grew deadly pale. For
his (<font color='blue'><b>Edgar</b></font>) life he (<font color='blue'><b>Edgar</b></font>) could not avert that excess of emotion: mingled anguish and
humiliation overcame him (<font color='blue'><b>Edgar</b></font>) completely. He (<font color='blue'><b>Edgar</b></font>) leant on the back of a chair,
and covered his (<font color='blue'><b>Edgar</b></font>) face.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Oh, heavens! In old days this would win you knighthood!''  (<font color='red'><b>Linton/Mrs. Linton/Mrs. Heathcliff</b></font>)</div>exclaimed Mrs.
Linton. <div class="bookquote">``We are vanquished! we are vanquished! Heathcliff would as soon
lift a finger at you as the king would march his (<font color='blue'><b>Heathcliff</b></font>) army against a colony of
mice. Cheer up! you sha'n't be hurt! Your type is not a lamb, it's a
sucking leveret.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I wish you joy of the milk-blooded coward, Cathy!''  (<font color='red'><b>friend</b></font>)</div>said her (<font color='blue'><b>Linton</b></font>) friend. <div class="bookquote">``I
compliment you on your taste. And that is the slavering, shivering thing
you preferred to me! I would not strike him (<font color='blue'><b>coward</b></font>) with my fist, but I'd kick
him (<font color='blue'><b>coward</b></font>) with my foot, and experience considerable satisfaction. Is he (<font color='blue'><b>coward</b></font>)
weeping, or is he (<font color='blue'><b>coward</b></font>) going to faint for fear?''

 (<font color='red'><b>Linton/Mrs. Linton/Mrs. Heathcliff</b></font>)</div><p/>The fellow approached and gave the chair on which Linton rested a push.
He (<font color='blue'><b>friend</b></font>)'d better have kept his (<font color='blue'><b>friend</b></font>) distance: my master quickly sprang erect, and
struck him (<font color='blue'><b>friend</b></font>) full on the throat a blow that would have levelled a slighter
man. It took his (<font color='blue'><b>friend</b></font>) breath for a minute; and while he (<font color='blue'><b>friend</b></font>) choked, Mr. Linton
walked out by the back door into the yard, and from thence to the front
entrance.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``There! you've done with coming here,''  (<font color='red'><b>Catherine/Earnshaw/Catherine Earnshaw</b></font>)</div>cried Catherine. <div class="bookquote">``Get away, now;
he (<font color='blue'><b>coward</b></font>)'ll return with a brace of pistols and half-a-dozen assistants. If he (<font color='blue'><b>coward</b></font>)
did overhear us, of course he (<font color='blue'><b>coward</b></font>)'d never forgive you. You've played me an
ill turn, Heathcliff! But go--make haste! I'd rather see Edgar at bay
than you.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Do you suppose I'm going with that blow burning in my gullet?''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Linton</b></font>)
thundered. <div class="bookquote">``By hell, no! I'll crush his (<font color='blue'><b>Edgar</b></font>) ribs in like a rotten hazel-nut
before I cross the threshold! If I don't floor him (<font color='blue'><b>Edgar</b></font>) now, I shall murder
him (<font color='blue'><b>Edgar</b></font>) some time; so, as you value his (<font color='blue'><b>Edgar</b></font>) existence, let me get at him (<font color='blue'><b>Edgar</b></font>)!''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``He (<font color='blue'><b>Edgar</b></font>) is not coming,''  (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div>I interposed, framing a bit of a lie. <div class="bookquote">``There's the
coachman and the two gardeners; you'll surely not wait to be thrust into
the road by them! Each has a bludgeon; and master will, very likely, be
watching from the parlour-windows to see that they fulfil his (<font color='blue'><b>master</b></font>) orders.''

 (<font color='red'><b>The gardeners coachman</b></font>)</div><p/>The gardeners and coachman were there: but Linton was with them. They
had already entered the court. Heathcliff, on the second thoughts,
resolved to avoid a struggle against three underlings: he (<font color='blue'><b>Heathcliff</b></font>) seized the
poker, smashed the lock from the inner door, and made his (<font color='blue'><b>Heathcliff</b></font>) escape as they
tramped in.

<p/>Mrs. Linton, who was very much excited, bade me accompany her (<font color='blue'><b>Linton</b></font>) up-stairs.
She (<font color='blue'><b>Linton</b></font>) did not know my share in contributing to the disturbance, and I was
anxious to keep her (<font color='blue'><b>Linton</b></font>) in ignorance.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``I'm nearly distracted, Nelly!''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Linton</b></font>) exclaimed, throwing herself on the
sofa. <div class="bookquote">``A thousand smiths' hammers are beating in my head! Tell Isabella
to shun me; this uproar is owing to her (<font color='blue'><b>Isabella</b></font>); and should she (<font color='blue'><b>Isabella</b></font>) or any one else
aggravate my anger at present, I shall get wild. And, Nelly, say to
Edgar, if you see him (<font color='blue'><b>Nelly</b></font>) again to-night, that I'm in danger of being
seriously ill. I wish it may prove true. He (<font color='blue'><b>Nelly</b></font>) has startled and distressed
me shockingly! I want to frighten him (<font color='blue'><b>Nelly</b></font>). Besides, he (<font color='blue'><b>Nelly</b></font>) might come and begin
a string of abuse or complainings; I'm certain I should recriminate, and
God knows where we should end! Will you do so, my good Nelly? You are
aware that I am no way blamable in this matter. What possessed him (<font color='blue'><b>Nelly</b></font>) to
turn listener? Heathcliff's talk was outrageous, after you left us; but
I could soon have diverted him (<font color='blue'><b>Heathcliff</b></font>) from Isabella, and the rest meant nothing.
Now all is dashed wrong; by the fool's craving to hear evil of self, that
haunts some people like a demon! Had Edgar never gathered our
conversation, he (<font color='blue'><b>Edgar</b></font>) would never have been the worse for it. Really, when he (<font color='blue'><b>Edgar</b></font>)
opened on me in that unreasonable tone of displeasure after I had scolded
Heathcliff till I was hoarse for him (<font color='blue'><b>Heathcliff</b></font>), I did not care hardly what they did
to each other; especially as I felt that, however the scene closed, we
should all be driven asunder for nobody knows how long! Well, if I
cannot keep Heathcliff for my friend--if Edgar will be mean and jealous,
I'll try to break their hearts by breaking my own. That will be a prompt
way of finishing all, when I am pushed to extremity! But it's a deed to
be reserved for a forlorn hope; I'd not take Linton by surprise with it.
To this point he (<font color='blue'><b>Edgar</b></font>) has been discreet in dreading to provoke me; you must
represent the peril of quitting that policy, and remind him (<font color='blue'><b>Edgar</b></font>) of my
passionate temper, verging, when kindled, on frenzy. I wish you could
dismiss that apathy out of that countenance, and look rather more anxious
about me.''

 (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div><p/>The stolidity with which I received these instructions was, no doubt,
rather exasperating: for they were delivered in perfect sincerity; but I
believed a person who could plan the turning of her (<font color='blue'><b>Linton</b></font>) fits of passion to
account, beforehand, might, by exerting her (<font color='blue'><b>Linton</b></font>) will, manage to control
herself tolerably, even while under their influence; and I did not wish
to `frighten' her (<font color='blue'><b>Linton</b></font>) husband, as she (<font color='blue'><b>Linton</b></font>) said, and multiply his (<font color='blue'><b>husband</b></font>) annoyances for
the purpose of serving her (<font color='blue'><b>Linton</b></font>) selfishness. Therefore I said nothing when I
met the master coming towards the parlour; but I took the liberty of
turning back to listen whether they would resume their quarrel together.
He (<font color='blue'><b>master</b></font>) began to speak first.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Remain where you are, Catherine,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>master</b></font>) said; without any anger in his (<font color='blue'><b>master</b></font>)
voice, but with much sorrowful despondency. ``I shall not stay. I am
neither come to wrangle nor be reconciled; but I wish just to learn
whether, after this evening's events, you intend to continue your
intimacy with--'

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Oh, for mercy's sake,''  (<font color='red'><b>the mistress</b></font>)</div>interrupted the mistress, stamping her (<font color='blue'><b>mistress</b></font>) foot, `for
mercy's sake, let us hear no more of it now! Your cold blood cannot be
worked into a fever: your veins are full of ice-water; but mine are
boiling, and the sight of such chillness makes them dance.''

<p/><div class="bookquote">``To get rid of me, answer my question,''  (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Linton</b></font>)</div>persevered Mr. Linton. <div class="bookquote">``You must
answer it; and that violence does not alarm me. I have found that you
can be as stoical as anyone, when you please. Will you give up
Heathcliff hereafter, or will you give up me? It is impossible for you
to be _my_ friend and _his (<font color='blue'><b>friend</b></font>)_ at the same time; and I absolutely _require_
to know which you choose.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I require to be let alone!''  (<font color='red'><b>Catherine/Earnshaw/Catherine Earnshaw</b></font>)</div>exclaimed Catherine, furiously. <div class="bookquote">``I demand
it! Don't you see I can scarcely stand? Edgar, you--you leave me!''

 (<font color='red'><b>She</b></font>)</div><p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>Catherine</b></font>) rang the bell till it broke with a twang; I entered leisurely. It
was enough to try the temper of a saint, such senseless, wicked rages!
There she (<font color='blue'><b>Catherine</b></font>) lay dashing her (<font color='blue'><b>Catherine</b></font>) head against the arm of the sofa, and grinding
her (<font color='blue'><b>Catherine</b></font>) teeth, so that you might fancy she (<font color='blue'><b>Catherine</b></font>) would crash them to splinters! Mr.
Linton stood looking at her (<font color='blue'><b>Catherine</b></font>) in sudden compunction and fear. He (<font color='blue'><b>Linton</b></font>) told me
to fetch some water. She (<font color='blue'><b>Catherine</b></font>) had no breath for speaking. I brought a glass
full; and as she (<font color='blue'><b>Catherine</b></font>) would not drink, I sprinkled it on her (<font color='blue'><b>Catherine</b></font>) face. In a few
seconds she (<font color='blue'><b>Catherine</b></font>) stretched herself out stiff, and turned up her (<font color='blue'><b>Catherine</b></font>) eyes, while
her (<font color='blue'><b>Catherine</b></font>) cheeks, at once blanched and livid, assumed the aspect of death.
Linton looked terrified.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``There is nothing in the world the matter,''  (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div>I whispered. I did not want
him (<font color='blue'><b>Linton</b></font>) to yield, though I could not help being afraid in my heart.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``She (<font color='blue'><b>Heathcliff</b></font>) has blood on her (<font color='blue'><b>Heathcliff</b></font>) lips!''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Linton</b></font>) said, shuddering.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Never mind!''  (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div>I answered, tartly. And I told him (<font color='blue'><b>Linton</b></font>) how she (<font color='blue'><b>Linton</b></font>) had resolved,
previous to his (<font color='blue'><b>Linton</b></font>) coming, on exhibiting a fit of frenzy. I incautiously
gave the account aloud, and she (<font color='blue'><b>Linton</b></font>) heard me; for she (<font color='blue'><b>Linton</b></font>) started up--her (<font color='blue'><b>Linton</b></font>) hair
flying over her (<font color='blue'><b>Linton</b></font>) shoulders, her (<font color='blue'><b>Linton</b></font>) eyes flashing, the muscles of her (<font color='blue'><b>Linton</b></font>) neck
and arms standing out preternaturally. I made up my mind for broken
bones, at least; but she (<font color='blue'><b>Linton</b></font>) only glared about her (<font color='blue'><b>Linton</b></font>) for an instant, and then
rushed from the room. The master directed me to follow; I did, to her (<font color='blue'><b>Linton</b></font>)
chamber-door: she (<font color='blue'><b>Linton</b></font>) hindered me from going further by securing it against
me.

<p/>As she (<font color='blue'><b>Linton</b></font>) never offered to descend to breakfast next morning, I went to ask
whether she (<font color='blue'><b>Linton</b></font>) would have some carried up. <div class="bookquote">``No!''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Linton</b></font>) replied, peremptorily.
The same question was repeated at dinner and tea; and again on the morrow
after, and received the same answer. Mr. Linton, on his (<font color='blue'><b>Linton</b></font>) part, spent his (<font color='blue'><b>Linton</b></font>)
time in the library, and did not inquire concerning his (<font color='blue'><b>Linton</b></font>) wife's
occupations. Isabella and he (<font color='blue'><b>Linton</b></font>) had had an hour's interview, during which
he (<font color='blue'><b>Linton</b></font>) tried to elicit from her (<font color='blue'><b>Isabella</b></font>) some sentiment of proper horror for
Heathcliff's advances: but he (<font color='blue'><b>Heathcliff</b></font>) could make nothing of her (<font color='blue'><b>Isabella</b></font>) evasive replies,
and was obliged to close the examination unsatisfactorily; adding,
however, a solemn warning, that if she (<font color='blue'><b>Isabella</b></font>) were so insane as to encourage
that worthless suitor, it would dissolve all bonds of relationship
between herself and him (<font color='blue'><b>Heathcliff</b></font>).




<p/>CHAPTER XII


<p/>While Miss Linton moped about the park and garden, always silent, and
almost always in tears; and her (<font color='blue'><b>Linton</b></font>) brother shut himself up among books that
he (<font color='blue'><b>brother</b></font>) never opened--wearying, I guessed, with a continual vague expectation
that Catherine, repenting her (<font color='blue'><b>Catherine</b></font>) conduct, would come of her (<font color='blue'><b>Catherine</b></font>) own accord to
ask pardon, and seek a reconciliation--and _she (<font color='blue'><b>Catherine</b></font>)_ fasted pertinaciously,
under the idea, probably, that at every meal Edgar was ready to choke for
her (<font color='blue'><b>Catherine</b></font>) absence, and pride alone held him (<font color='blue'><b>Edgar</b></font>) from running to cast himself at her (<font color='blue'><b>Catherine</b></font>)
feet; I went about my household duties, convinced that the Grange had but
one sensible soul in its walls, and that lodged in my body. I wasted no
condolences on Miss, nor any expostulations on my mistress; nor did I pay
much attention to the sighs of my master, who yearned to hear his (<font color='blue'><b>master</b></font>) lady's
name, since he (<font color='blue'><b>master</b></font>) might not hear her (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) voice. I determined they should come
about as they pleased for me; and though it was a tiresomely slow
process, I began to rejoice at length in a faint dawn of its progress: as
I thought at first.

<p/>Mrs. Linton, on the third day, unbarred her (<font color='blue'><b>Linton</b></font>) door, and having finished the
water in her (<font color='blue'><b>Linton</b></font>) pitcher and decanter, desired a renewed supply, and a basin
of gruel, for she (<font color='blue'><b>Linton</b></font>) believed she (<font color='blue'><b>Linton</b></font>) was dying. That I set down as a speech
meant for Edgar's ears; I believed no such thing, so I kept it to myself
and brought her (<font color='blue'><b>Linton</b></font>) some tea and dry toast. She (<font color='blue'><b>Linton</b></font>) ate and drank eagerly, and
sank back on her (<font color='blue'><b>Linton</b></font>) pillow again, clenching her (<font color='blue'><b>Linton</b></font>) hands and groaning. <div class="bookquote">``Oh, I
will die,''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Linton</b></font>) exclaimed, `since no one cares anything about me. I wish
I had not taken that.'' Then a good while after I heard her (<font color='blue'><b>Linton</b></font>) murmur, <div class="bookquote">``No,
I'll not die--he (<font color='blue'><b>Edgar</b></font>)'d be glad--he (<font color='blue'><b>Edgar</b></font>) does not love me at all--he (<font color='blue'><b>Edgar</b></font>) would never
miss me!''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/>``Did you want anything, ma<div class="bookquote">``am?''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>I inquired, still preserving my external
composure, in spite of her (<font color='blue'><b>Linton</b></font>) ghastly countenance and strange, exaggerated
manner.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``What is that apathetic being doing?''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Linton</b></font>) demanded, pushing the thick
entangled locks from her (<font color='blue'><b>Linton</b></font>) wasted face. <div class="bookquote">``Has he (<font color='blue'><b>Edgar</b></font>) fallen into a lethargy, or
is he (<font color='blue'><b>Edgar</b></font>) dead?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Neither,''  (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div>replied I; `if you mean Mr. Linton. He (<font color='blue'><b>Linton</b></font>)'s tolerably well, I
think, though his (<font color='blue'><b>Linton</b></font>) studies occupy him (<font color='blue'><b>Linton</b></font>) rather more than they ought: he (<font color='blue'><b>Linton</b></font>) is
continually among his (<font color='blue'><b>Linton</b></font>) books, since he (<font color='blue'><b>Linton</b></font>) has no other society.''

<p/>I should not have spoken so if I had known her (<font color='blue'><b>Linton</b></font>) true condition, but I
could not get rid of the notion that she (<font color='blue'><b>Linton</b></font>) acted a part of her (<font color='blue'><b>Linton</b></font>) disorder.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Among his (<font color='blue'><b>Edgar</b></font>) books!''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Linton</b></font>) cried, confounded. <div class="bookquote">``And I dying! I on the brink
of the grave! My God! does he (<font color='blue'><b>God</b></font>) know how I'm altered?''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>continued she (<font color='blue'><b>Linton</b></font>),
staring at her (<font color='blue'><b>Linton</b></font>) reflection in a mirror hanging against the opposite wall.
<div class="bookquote">``Is that Catherine Linton? He (<font color='blue'><b>God</b></font>) imagines me in a pet--in play, perhaps.
Cannot you inform him (<font color='blue'><b>God</b></font>) that it is frightful earnest? Nelly, if it be not
too late, as soon as I learn how he (<font color='blue'><b>Nelly</b></font>) feels, I'll choose between these two:
either to starve at once--that would be no punishment unless he (<font color='blue'><b>Nelly</b></font>) had a
heart--or to recover, and leave the country. Are you speaking the truth
about him (<font color='blue'><b>Nelly</b></font>) now? Take care. Is he (<font color='blue'><b>Nelly</b></font>) actually so utterly indifferent for my
life?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/>``Why, ma``am,<div class="bookquote">'' I answered, `the master has no idea of your being deranged;
and of course he (<font color='blue'><b>master</b></font>) does not fear that you will let yourself die of hunger.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``You think not? Cannot you tell him (<font color='blue'><b>Nelly</b></font>) I will?''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Linton</b></font>) returned. <div class="bookquote">``Persuade
him (<font color='blue'><b>Nelly</b></font>)! speak of your own mind: say you are certain I will!''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``No, you forget, Mrs. Linton,''  (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div>I suggested, `that you have eaten some
food with a relish this evening, and to-morrow you will perceive its good
effects.''

<p/><div class="bookquote">``If I were only sure it would kill him (<font color='blue'><b>Nelly</b></font>),''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Linton</b></font>) interrupted, <div class="bookquote">``I'd kill
myself directly! These three awful nights I've never closed my lids--and
oh, I've been tormented! I've been haunted, Nelly! But I begin to fancy
you don't like me. How strange! I thought, though everybody hated and
despised each other, they could not avoid loving me. And they have all
turned to enemies in a few hours: they have, I'm positive; the people
here. How dreary to meet death, surrounded by their cold faces!
Isabella, terrified and repelled, afraid to enter the room, it would be
so dreadful to watch Catherine go. And Edgar standing solemnly by to see
it over; then offering prayers of thanks to God for restoring peace to
his (<font color='blue'><b>God</b></font>) house, and going back to his (<font color='blue'><b>God</b></font>) _books_! What in the name of all that
feels has he (<font color='blue'><b>God</b></font>) to do with _books_, when I am dying?''

 (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div><p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>Linton</b></font>) could not bear the notion which I had put into her (<font color='blue'><b>Linton</b></font>) head of Mr.
Linton's philosophical resignation. Tossing about, she (<font color='blue'><b>Linton</b></font>) increased her (<font color='blue'><b>Linton</b></font>)
feverish bewilderment to madness, and tore the pillow with her (<font color='blue'><b>Linton</b></font>) teeth;
then raising herself up all burning, desired that I would open the
window. We were in the middle of winter, the wind blew strong from the
north-east, and I objected. Both the expressions flitting over her (<font color='blue'><b>Linton</b></font>) face,
and the changes of her (<font color='blue'><b>Linton</b></font>) moods, began to alarm me terribly; and brought to
my recollection her (<font color='blue'><b>Linton</b></font>) former illness, and the doctor's injunction that she (<font color='blue'><b>Linton</b></font>)
should not be crossed. A minute previously she (<font color='blue'><b>Linton</b></font>) was violent; now,
supported on one arm, and not noticing my refusal to obey her (<font color='blue'><b>Linton</b></font>), she (<font color='blue'><b>Linton</b></font>) seemed
to find childish diversion in pulling the feathers from the rents she (<font color='blue'><b>Linton</b></font>) had
just made, and ranging them on the sheet according to their different
species: her (<font color='blue'><b>Linton</b></font>) mind had strayed to other associations.

<p/>``That's a turkey``s,<div class="bookquote">'' she (<font color='blue'><b>Linton</b></font>) murmured to herself; `and this is a wild duck's;
and this is a pigeon's. Ah, they put pigeons' feathers in the pillows--no
wonder I couldn't die! Let me take care to throw it on the floor when I
lie down. And here is a moor-cock's; and this--I should know it among a
thousand--it's a lapwing's. Bonny bird; wheeling over our heads in the
middle of the moor. It wanted to get to its nest, for the clouds had
touched the swells, and it felt rain coming. This feather was picked up
from the heath, the bird was not shot: we saw its nest in the winter,
full of little skeletons. Heathcliff set a trap over it, and the old
ones dared not come. I made him (<font color='blue'><b>Heathcliff</b></font>) promise he (<font color='blue'><b>Heathcliff</b></font>)'d never shoot a lapwing after
that, and he (<font color='blue'><b>Heathcliff</b></font>) didn't. Yes, here are more! Did he (<font color='blue'><b>Heathcliff</b></font>) shoot my lapwings,
Nelly? Are they red, any of them? Let me look.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Give over with that baby-work!''  (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div>I interrupted, dragging the pillow away,
and turning the holes towards the mattress, for she (<font color='blue'><b>I</b></font>) was removing its
contents by handfuls. <div class="bookquote">``Lie down and shut your eyes: you're wandering.
There's a mess! The down is flying about like snow.''

 (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div><p/>I went here and there collecting it.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``I see in you, Nelly,''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>I</b></font>) continued dreamily, `an aged woman: you have
grey hair and bent shoulders. This bed is the fairy cave under Penistone
crags, and you are gathering elf-bolts to hurt our heifers; pretending,
while I am near, that they are only locks of wool. That's what you'll
come to fifty years hence: I know you are not so now. I'm not wandering:
you're mistaken, or else I should believe you really _were_ that withered
hag, and I should think I _was_ under Penistone Crags; and I'm conscious
it's night, and there are two candles on the table making the black press
shine like jet.''

<p/><div class="bookquote">``The black press? where is that?''  (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div>I asked. <div class="bookquote">``You are talking in your
sleep!''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``It's against the wall, as it always is,''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>it</b></font>) replied. <div class="bookquote">``It _does_ appear
odd--I see a face in it!''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``There's no press in the room, and never was,''  (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div>said I, resuming my seat,
and looping up the curtain that I might watch her (<font color='blue'><b>it</b></font>).

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Don't _you_ see that face?''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>it</b></font>) inquired, gazing earnestly at the
mirror.

<p/>And say what I could, I was incapable of making her (<font color='blue'><b>it</b></font>) comprehend it to be
her (<font color='blue'><b>it</b></font>) own; so I rose and covered it with a shawl.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``It's behind there still!''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>it</b></font>) pursued, anxiously. <div class="bookquote">``And it stirred. Who
is it? I hope it will not come out when you are gone! Oh! Nelly, the
room is haunted! I'm afraid of being alone!''

 (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div><p/>I took her (<font color='blue'><b>it</b></font>) hand in mine, and bid her (<font color='blue'><b>it</b></font>) be composed; for a succession of
shudders convulsed her (<font color='blue'><b>it</b></font>) frame, and she (<font color='blue'><b>it</b></font>) would keep straining her (<font color='blue'><b>it</b></font>) gaze
towards the glass.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``There's nobody here!''  (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div>I insisted. <div class="bookquote">``It was _yourself_, Mrs. Linton: you
knew it a while since.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Myself!''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>it</b></font>) gasped, `and the clock is striking twelve! It's true,
then! that's dreadful!''

<p/>Her (<font color='blue'><b>it</b></font>) fingers clutched the clothes, and gathered them over her (<font color='blue'><b>it</b></font>) eyes. I
attempted to steal to the door with an intention of calling her (<font color='blue'><b>it</b></font>) husband;
but I was summoned back by a piercing shriek--the shawl had dropped from
the frame.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Why, what is the matter?''  (<font color='red'><b>I.</b></font>)</div>cried I. <div class="bookquote">``Who is coward now? Wake up! That
is the glass--the mirror, Mrs. Linton; and you see yourself in it, and
there am I too by your side.''

 (<font color='red'><b>I.</b></font>)</div><p/>Trembling and bewildered, she (<font color='blue'><b>it</b></font>) held me fast, but the horror gradually
passed from her (<font color='blue'><b>it</b></font>) countenance; its paleness gave place to a glow of shame.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Oh, dear! I thought I was at home,''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>it</b></font>) sighed. <div class="bookquote">``I thought I was lying
in my chamber at Wuthering Heights. Because I'm weak, my brain got
confused, and I screamed unconsciously. Don't say anything; but stay
with me. I dread sleeping: my dreams appal me.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/>``A sound sleep would do you good, ma``am,<div class="bookquote">'' I answered: `and I hope this
suffering will prevent your trying starving again.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Oh, if I were but in my own bed in the old house!''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>it</b></font>) went on bitterly,
wringing her (<font color='blue'><b>it</b></font>) hands. <div class="bookquote">``And that wind sounding in the firs by the lattice.
Do let me feel it--it comes straight down the moor--do let me have one
breath!''  (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div>To pacify her (<font color='blue'><b>it</b></font>) I held the casement ajar a few seconds. A cold
blast rushed through; I closed it, and returned to my post. She (<font color='blue'><b>it</b></font>) lay
still now, her (<font color='blue'><b>it</b></font>) face bathed in tears. Exhaustion of body had entirely
subdued her (<font color='blue'><b>it</b></font>) spirit: our fiery Catherine was no better than a wailing
child.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``How long is it since I shut myself in here?''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Catherine</b></font>) asked, suddenly
reviving.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``It was Monday evening,''  (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div>I replied, `and this is Thursday night, or
rather Friday morning, at present.''

<p/><div class="bookquote">``What! of the same week?''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Catherine</b></font>) exclaimed. <div class="bookquote">``Only that brief time?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Long enough to live on nothing but cold water and ill-temper,''  (<font color='red'><b>I.</b></font>)</div>observed
I.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Well, it seems a weary number of hours,''  (<font color='red'><b>I.</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Catherine</b></font>) muttered doubtfully: `it
must be more. I remember being in the parlour after they had quarrelled,
and Edgar being cruelly provoking, and me running into this room
desperate. As soon as ever I had barred the door, utter blackness
overwhelmed me, and I fell on the floor. I couldn't explain to Edgar how
certain I felt of having a fit, or going raging mad, if he (<font color='blue'><b>Edgar</b></font>) persisted in
teasing me! I had no command of tongue, or brain, and he (<font color='blue'><b>Edgar</b></font>) did not guess
my agony, perhaps: it barely left me sense to try to escape from him (<font color='blue'><b>Edgar</b></font>) and
his (<font color='blue'><b>Edgar</b></font>) voice. Before I recovered sufficiently to see and hear, it began to
be dawn, and, Nelly, I'll tell you what I thought, and what has kept
recurring and recurring till I feared for my reason. I thought as I lay
there, with my head against that table leg, and my eyes dimly discerning
the grey square of the window, that I was enclosed in the oak-panelled
bed at home; and my heart ached with some great grief which, just
waking, I could not recollect. I pondered, and worried myself to
discover what it could be, and, most strangely, the whole last seven
years of my life grew a blank! I did not recall that they had been at
all. I was a child; my father was just buried, and my misery arose from
the separation that Hindley had ordered between me and Heathcliff. I was
laid alone, for the first time; and, rousing from a dismal doze after a
night of weeping, I lifted my hand to push the panels aside: it struck
the table-top! I swept it along the carpet, and then memory burst in: my
late anguish was swallowed in a paroxysm of despair. I cannot say why I
felt so wildly wretched: it must have been temporary derangement; for
there is scarcely cause. But, supposing at twelve years old I had been
wrenched from the Heights, and every early association, and my all in
all, as Heathcliff was at that time, and been converted at a stroke into
Mrs. Linton, the lady of Thrushcross Grange, and the wife of a stranger:
an exile, and outcast, thenceforth, from what had been my world. You may
fancy a glimpse of the abyss where I grovelled! Shake your head as you
will, Nelly, you have helped to unsettle me! You should have spoken to
Edgar, indeed you should, and compelled him (<font color='blue'><b>Edgar</b></font>) to leave me quiet! Oh, I'm
burning! I wish I were out of doors! I wish I were a girl again, half
savage and hardy, and free; and laughing at injuries, not maddening
under them! Why am I so changed? why does my blood rush into a hell of
tumult at a few words? I'm sure I should be myself were I once among the
heather on those hills. Open the window again wide: fasten it open!
Quick, why don't you move?''

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Because I won't give you your death of cold,''  (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div>I answered.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``You won't give me a chance of life, you mean,''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) said, sullenly.
<div class="bookquote">``However, I'm not helpless yet; I'll open it myself.''

 (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div><p/>And sliding from the bed before I could hinder her (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>), she (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) crossed the room,
walking very uncertainly, threw it back, and bent out, careless of the
frosty air that cut about her (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) shoulders as keen as a knife. I entreated,
and finally attempted to force her (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) to retire. But I soon found her (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>)
delirious strength much surpassed mine -LRB-she (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) was delirious, I became
convinced by her (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) subsequent actions and ravings-RRB-. There was no moon, and
everything beneath lay in misty darkness: not a light gleamed from any
house, far or near all had been extinguished long ago: and those at
Wuthering Heights were never visible--still she (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) asserted she (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) caught their
shining.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Look!''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) cried eagerly, `that's my room with the candle in it, and the
trees swaying before it; and the other candle is in Joseph's garret.
Joseph sits up late, doesn't he (<font color='blue'><b>Joseph</b></font>)? He (<font color='blue'><b>Joseph</b></font>)'s waiting till I come home that he (<font color='blue'><b>Joseph</b></font>)
may lock the gate. Well, he (<font color='blue'><b>Joseph</b></font>)'ll wait a while yet. It's a rough journey,
and a sad heart to travel it; and we must pass by Gimmerton Kirk to go
that journey! We've braved its ghosts often together, and dared each
other to stand among the graves and ask them to come. But, Heathcliff,
if I dare you now, will you venture? If you do, I'll keep you. I'll not
lie there by myself: they may bury me twelve feet deep, and throw the
church down over me, but I won't rest till you are with me. I never
will!''

<p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>you</b></font>) paused, and resumed with a strange smile. <div class="bookquote">``He (<font color='blue'><b>Long</b></font>)'s considering--he (<font color='blue'><b>Long</b></font>)'d
rather I'd come to him (<font color='blue'><b>Long</b></font>)! Find a way, then! not through that kirkyard. You
are slow! Be content, you always followed me!''

 (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div><p/>Perceiving it vain to argue against her (<font color='blue'><b>you</b></font>) insanity, I was planning how I
could reach something to wrap about her (<font color='blue'><b>you</b></font>), without quitting my hold of
herself -LRB-for I could not trust her (<font color='blue'><b>you</b></font>) alone by the gaping lattice-RRB-, when, to
my consternation, I heard the rattle of the door-handle, and Mr. Linton
entered. He (<font color='blue'><b>Linton</b></font>) had only then come from the library; and, in passing through
the lobby, had noticed our talking and been attracted by curiosity, or
fear, to examine what it signified, at that late hour.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Oh, sir!''  (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div>I cried, checking the exclamation risen to his (<font color='blue'><b>Linton</b></font>) lips at the
sight which met him (<font color='blue'><b>Linton</b></font>), and the bleak atmosphere of the chamber. <div class="bookquote">``My poor
mistress is ill, and she (<font color='blue'><b>mistress</b></font>) quite masters me: I cannot manage her (<font color='blue'><b>mistress</b></font>) at all;
pray, come and persuade her (<font color='blue'><b>mistress</b></font>) to go to bed. Forget your anger, for she (<font color='blue'><b>mistress</b></font>)'s
hard to guide any way but her (<font color='blue'><b>mistress</b></font>) own.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Catherine ill?''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Linton</b></font>) said, hastening to us. ``Shut the window, Ellen!
Catherine! why--'

<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Long</b></font>) was silent. The haggardness of Mrs. Linton's appearance smote him (<font color='blue'><b>Long</b></font>)
speechless, and he (<font color='blue'><b>Long</b></font>) could only glance from her (<font color='blue'><b>Linton</b></font>) to me in horrified
astonishment.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``She (<font color='blue'><b>Linton</b></font>)'s been fretting here,''  (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div>I continued, `and eating scarcely anything,
and never complaining: she (<font color='blue'><b>Linton</b></font>) would admit none of us till this evening, and
so we couldn't inform you of her (<font color='blue'><b>Linton</b></font>) state, as we were not aware of it
ourselves; but it is nothing.''

<p/>I felt I uttered my explanations awkwardly; the master frowned. <div class="bookquote">``It is
nothing, is it, Ellen Dean?''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>master</b></font>) said sternly. <div class="bookquote">``You shall account more
clearly for keeping me ignorant of this!''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>And he (<font color='blue'><b>master</b></font>) took his (<font color='blue'><b>master</b></font>) wife in his (<font color='blue'><b>master</b></font>)
arms, and looked at her (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>) with anguish.

<p/>At first she (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>) gave him (<font color='blue'><b>master</b></font>) no glance of recognition: he (<font color='blue'><b>master</b></font>) was invisible to her (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>)
abstracted gaze. The delirium was not fixed, however; having weaned her (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>)
eyes from contemplating the outer darkness, by degrees she (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>) centred her (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>)
attention on him (<font color='blue'><b>master</b></font>), and discovered who it was that held her (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>).

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Ah! you are come, are you, Edgar Linton?''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>) said, with angry
animation. <div class="bookquote">``You are one of those things that are ever found when least
wanted, and when you are wanted, never! I suppose we shall have plenty
of lamentations now--I see we shall--but they can't keep me from my
narrow home out yonder: my resting-place, where I'm bound before spring
is over! There it is: not among the Lintons, mind, under the
chapel-roof, but in the open air, with a head-stone; and you may please
yourself whether you go to them or come to me!''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Catherine, what have you done?''  (<font color='red'><b>the master</b></font>)</div>commenced the master. ``Am I nothing to
you any more? Do you love that wretch Heath--'

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Hush!''  (<font color='red'><b>Linton/Mrs. Linton/Mrs. Heathcliff</b></font>)</div>cried Mrs. Linton. <div class="bookquote">``Hush, this moment! You mention that name
and I end the matter instantly by a spring from the window! What you
touch at present you may have; but my soul will be on that hill-top
before you lay hands on me again. I don't want you, Edgar: I'm past
wanting you. Return to your books. I'm glad you possess a consolation,
for all you had in me is gone.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Her (<font color='blue'><b>Heath</b></font>) mind wanders, sir,''  (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div>I interposed. <div class="bookquote">``She (<font color='blue'><b>Heath</b></font>) has been talking nonsense
the whole evening; but let her (<font color='blue'><b>Heath</b></font>) have quiet, and proper attendance, and
she (<font color='blue'><b>Heath</b></font>)'ll rally. Hereafter, we must be cautious how we vex her (<font color='blue'><b>Heath</b></font>).''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I desire no further advice from you,''  (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Linton</b></font>)</div>answered Mr. Linton. <div class="bookquote">``You knew
your mistress's nature, and you encouraged me to harass her (<font color='blue'><b>mistress</b></font>). And not to
give me one hint of how she (<font color='blue'><b>mistress</b></font>) has been these three days! It was heartless!
Months of sickness could not cause such a change!''

 (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div><p/>I began to defend myself, thinking it too bad to be blamed for another's
wicked waywardness. <div class="bookquote">``I knew Mrs. Linton's nature to be headstrong and
domineering,''  (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div>cried I: `but I didn't know that you wished to foster her (<font color='blue'><b>Linton</b></font>)
fierce temper! I didn't know that, to humour her (<font color='blue'><b>Linton</b></font>), I should wink at Mr.
Heathcliff. I performed the duty of a faithful servant in telling you,
and I have got a faithful servant's wages! Well, it will teach me to be
careful next time. Next time you may gather intelligence for yourself!''

<p/><div class="bookquote">``The next time you bring a tale to me you shall quit my service, Ellen
Dean,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>servant</b></font>) replied.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``You'd rather hear nothing about it, I suppose, then, Mr. Linton?''  (<font color='red'><b>I.</b></font>)</div>said
I. <div class="bookquote">``Heathcliff has your permission to come a-courting to Miss, and to
drop in at every opportunity your absence offers, on purpose to poison
the mistress against you?''

 (<font color='red'><b>I.</b></font>)</div><p/>Confused as Catherine was, her (<font color='blue'><b>Catherine</b></font>) wits were alert at applying our
conversation.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Ah! Nelly has played traitor,''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Catherine</b></font>) exclaimed, passionately. <div class="bookquote">``Nelly is
my hidden enemy. You witch! So you do seek elf-bolts to hurt us! Let
me go, and I'll make her (<font color='blue'><b>witch</b></font>) rue! I'll make her (<font color='blue'><b>witch</b></font>) howl a recantation!''

 (<font color='red'><b>A maniac</b></font>)</div><p/>A maniac's fury kindled under her (<font color='blue'><b>Catherine</b></font>) brows; she (<font color='blue'><b>Catherine</b></font>) struggled desperately to
disengage herself from Linton's arms. I felt no inclination to tarry the
event; and, resolving to seek medical aid on my own responsibility, I
quitted the chamber.

<p/>In passing the garden to reach the road, at a place where a bridle hook
is driven into the wall, I saw something white moved irregularly,
evidently by another agent than the wind. Notwithstanding my hurry, I
stayed to examine it, lest ever after I should have the conviction
impressed on my imagination that it was a creature of the other world. My
surprise and perplexity were great on discovering, by touch more than
vision, Miss Isabella's springer, Fanny, suspended by a handkerchief, and
nearly at its last gasp. I quickly released the animal, and lifted it
into the garden. I had seen it follow its mistress up-stairs when she (<font color='blue'><b>mistress</b></font>)
went to bed; and wondered much how it could have got out there, and what
mischievous person had treated it so. While untying the knot round the
hook, it seemed to me that I repeatedly caught the beat of horses' feet
galloping at some distance; but there were such a number of things to
occupy my reflections that I hardly gave the circumstance a thought:
though it was a strange sound, in that place, at two o'clock in the
morning.

<p/>Mr. Kenneth was fortunately just issuing from his (<font color='blue'><b>Kenneth</b></font>) house to see a patient
in the village as I came up the street; and my account of Catherine
Linton's malady induced him (<font color='blue'><b>Kenneth</b></font>) to accompany me back immediately. He (<font color='blue'><b>Kenneth</b></font>) was a
plain rough man; and he (<font color='blue'><b>Kenneth</b></font>) made no scruple to speak his (<font color='blue'><b>Kenneth</b></font>) doubts of her (<font color='blue'><b>I</b></font>)
surviving this second attack; unless she (<font color='blue'><b>I</b></font>) were more submissive to his (<font color='blue'><b>Kenneth</b></font>)
directions than she (<font color='blue'><b>I</b></font>) had shown herself before.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Nelly Dean,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>said he (<font color='blue'><b>Kenneth</b></font>), <div class="bookquote">``I can't help fancying there's an extra cause for
this. What has there been to do at the Grange? We've odd reports up
here. A stout, hearty lass like Catherine does not fall ill for a
trifle; and that sort of people should not either. It's hard work
bringing them through fevers, and such things. How did it begin?''

 (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``The master will inform you,''  (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div>I answered; `but you are acquainted with
the Earnshaws' violent dispositions, and Mrs. Linton caps them all. I
may say this; it commenced in a quarrel. She (<font color='blue'><b>Linton</b></font>) was struck during a tempest
of passion with a kind of fit. That's her (<font color='blue'><b>Linton</b></font>) account, at least: for she (<font color='blue'><b>Linton</b></font>)
flew off in the height of it, and locked herself up. Afterwards, she (<font color='blue'><b>Linton</b></font>)
refused to eat, and now she (<font color='blue'><b>Linton</b></font>) alternately raves and remains in a half
dream; knowing those about her (<font color='blue'><b>Linton</b></font>), but having her (<font color='blue'><b>Linton</b></font>) mind filled with all sorts
of strange ideas and illusions.''

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Mr. Linton will be sorry?''  (<font color='red'><b>Kenneth/Mr. Kenneth</b></font>)</div>observed Kenneth, interrogatively.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Sorry? he (<font color='blue'><b>Linton</b></font>)'ll break his (<font color='blue'><b>Linton</b></font>) heart should anything happen!''  (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div>I replied. <div class="bookquote">``Don't
alarm him (<font color='blue'><b>Linton</b></font>) more than necessary.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Well, I told him (<font color='blue'><b>Linton</b></font>) to beware,''  (<font color='red'><b>companion</b></font>)</div>said my companion; `and he (<font color='blue'><b>companion</b></font>) must bide the
consequences of neglecting my warning! Hasn't he (<font color='blue'><b>companion</b></font>) been intimate with Mr.
Heathcliff lately?''

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Heathcliff frequently visits at the Grange,''  (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div>answered I, `though more on
the strength of the mistress having known him (<font color='blue'><b>companion</b></font>) when a boy, than because
the master likes his (<font color='blue'><b>master</b></font>) company. At present he (<font color='blue'><b>master</b></font>)'s discharged from the
trouble of calling; owing to some presumptuous aspirations after Miss
Linton which he (<font color='blue'><b>master</b></font>) manifested. I hardly think he (<font color='blue'><b>master</b></font>)'ll be taken in again.''

<p/><div class="bookquote">``And does Miss Linton turn a cold shoulder on him (<font color='blue'><b>Linton</b></font>)?''  (<font color='red'><b>the doctor</b></font>)</div>was the doctor's next
question.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``I'm not in her (<font color='blue'><b>Linton</b></font>) confidence,''  (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div>returned I, reluctant to continue the
subject.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``No, she (<font color='blue'><b>Linton</b></font>)'s a sly one,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>master</b></font>) remarked, shaking his (<font color='blue'><b>master</b></font>) head. <div class="bookquote">``She (<font color='blue'><b>Linton</b></font>) keeps her (<font color='blue'><b>Linton</b></font>) own
counsel! But she (<font color='blue'><b>Linton</b></font>)'s a real little fool. I have it from good authority
that last night -LRB-and a pretty night it was!-RRB- she (<font color='blue'><b>Linton</b></font>) and Heathcliff were
walking in the plantation at the back of your house above two hours; and
he (<font color='blue'><b>Heathcliff</b></font>) pressed her (<font color='blue'><b>Linton</b></font>) not to go in again, but just mount his (<font color='blue'><b>Heathcliff</b></font>) horse and away with
him (<font color='blue'><b>Heathcliff</b></font>)! My informant said she (<font color='blue'><b>Linton</b></font>) could only put him (<font color='blue'><b>Heathcliff</b></font>) off by pledging her (<font color='blue'><b>Linton</b></font>) word
of honour to be prepared on their first meeting after that: when it was
to be he (<font color='blue'><b>Heathcliff</b></font>) didn't hear; but you urge Mr. Linton to look sharp!''

 (<font color='red'><b>me</b></font>)</div><p/>This news filled me with fresh fears; I outstripped Kenneth, and ran most
of the way back. The little dog was yelping in the garden yet. I spared
a minute to open the gate for it, but instead of going to the house door,
it coursed up and down snuffing the grass, and would have escaped to the
road, had I not seized it and conveyed it in with me. On ascending to
Isabella's room, my suspicions were confirmed: it was empty. Had I been
a few hours sooner Mrs. Linton's illness might have arrested her (<font color='blue'><b>Linton</b></font>) rash
step. But what could be done now? There was a bare possibility of
overtaking them if pursued instantly. _I_ could not pursue them,
however; and I dared not rouse the family, and fill the place with
confusion; still less unfold the business to my master, absorbed as he (<font color='blue'><b>master</b></font>)
was in his (<font color='blue'><b>master</b></font>) present calamity, and having no heart to spare for a second
grief! I saw nothing for it but to hold my tongue, and suffer matters to
take their course; and Kenneth being arrived, I went with a badly
composed countenance to announce him (<font color='blue'><b>Kenneth</b></font>). Catherine lay in a troubled sleep:
her (<font color='blue'><b>Catherine</b></font>) husband had succeeded in soothing the excess of frenzy; he (<font color='blue'><b>husband</b></font>) now hung
over her (<font color='blue'><b>Catherine</b></font>) pillow, watching every shade and every change of her (<font color='blue'><b>Catherine</b></font>) painfully
expressive features.

<p/>The doctor, on examining the case for himself, spoke hopefully to him (<font color='blue'><b>doctor</b></font>) of
its having a favourable termination, if we could only preserve around her (<font color='blue'><b>Catherine</b></font>)
perfect and constant tranquillity. To me, he (<font color='blue'><b>doctor</b></font>) signified the threatening
danger was not so much death, as permanent alienation of intellect.

<p/>I did not close my eyes that night, nor did Mr. Linton: indeed, we never
went to bed; and the servants were all up long before the usual hour,
moving through the house with stealthy tread, and exchanging whispers as
they encountered each other in their vocations. Every one was active but
Miss Isabella; and they began to remark how sound she (<font color='blue'><b>Isabella</b></font>) slept: her (<font color='blue'><b>Isabella</b></font>) brother,
too, asked if she (<font color='blue'><b>Isabella</b></font>) had risen, and seemed impatient for her (<font color='blue'><b>Isabella</b></font>) presence, and
hurt that she (<font color='blue'><b>Isabella</b></font>) showed so little anxiety for her (<font color='blue'><b>Isabella</b></font>) sister-in-law. I trembled
lest he (<font color='blue'><b>brother</b></font>) should send me to call her (<font color='blue'><b>Isabella</b></font>); but I was spared the pain of being
the first proclaimant of her (<font color='blue'><b>Isabella</b></font>) flight. One of the maids, a thoughtless
girl, who had been on an early errand to Gimmerton, came panting
up-stairs, open-mouthed, and dashed into the chamber, crying: ``Oh, dear,
dear! What mun we have next? Master, master, our young lady--'

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Hold your noise!''  (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div>cried, I hastily, enraged at her (<font color='blue'><b>Isabella</b></font>) clamorous manner.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Speak lower, Mary--What is the matter?''  (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Linton</b></font>)</div>said Mr. Linton. <div class="bookquote">``What ails
your young lady?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``She (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>)'s gone, she (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>)'s gone! Yon' Heathcliff's run off wi' her (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>)!''  (<font color='red'><b>the girl</b></font>)</div>gasped the
girl.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``That is not true!''  (<font color='red'><b>Linton/Mrs. Linton/Mrs. Heathcliff</b></font>)</div>exclaimed Linton, rising in agitation. <div class="bookquote">``It cannot
be: how has the idea entered your head? Ellen Dean, go and seek her (<font color='blue'><b>Dean</b></font>). It
is incredible: it cannot be.''

 (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div><p/>As he (<font color='blue'><b>Linton</b></font>) spoke he (<font color='blue'><b>Linton</b></font>) took the servant to the door, and then repeated his (<font color='blue'><b>Linton</b></font>) demand
to know her (<font color='blue'><b>Linton</b></font>) reasons for such an assertion.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Why, I met on the road a lad that fetches milk here,''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Linton</b></font>) stammered,
`and he (<font color='blue'><b>Linton</b></font>) asked whether we weren't in trouble at the Grange. I thought he (<font color='blue'><b>Linton</b></font>)
meant for missis's sickness, so I answered, yes. Then says he (<font color='blue'><b>Linton</b></font>), <div class="bookquote">``There's
somebody gone after 'em, I guess?''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>I stared. He (<font color='blue'><b>Linton</b></font>) saw I knew nought about
it, and he (<font color='blue'><b>Linton</b></font>) told how a gentleman and lady had stopped to have a horse's
shoe fastened at a blacksmith's shop, two miles out of Gimmerton, not
very long after midnight! and how the blacksmith's lass had got up to spy
who they were: she (<font color='blue'><b>lass</b></font>) knew them both directly. And she (<font color='blue'><b>lass</b></font>) noticed the
man--Heathcliff it was, she (<font color='blue'><b>lass</b></font>) felt certain: nob`dy could mistake him (<font color='blue'><b>Heathcliff</b></font>),
besides--put a sovereign in her (<font color='blue'><b>lass</b></font>) father's hand for payment. The lady had
a cloak about her (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) face; but having desired a sup of water, while she (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>)
drank it fell back, and she (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) saw her (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) very plain. Heathcliff held both
bridles as they rode on, and they set their faces from the village, and
went as fast as the rough roads would let them. The lass said nothing to
her (<font color='blue'><b>lass</b></font>) father, but she (<font color='blue'><b>lass</b></font>) told it all over Gimmerton this morning.''

<p/>I ran and peeped, for form's sake, into Isabella's room; confirming, when
I returned, the servant's statement. Mr. Linton had resumed his (<font color='blue'><b>Linton</b></font>) seat by
the bed; on my re-entrance, he (<font color='blue'><b>Linton</b></font>) raised his (<font color='blue'><b>Linton</b></font>) eyes, read the meaning of my
blank aspect, and dropped them without giving an order, or uttering a
word.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Are we to try any measures for overtaking and bringing her (<font color='blue'><b>Dean</b></font>) back,''  (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div>I
inquired. <div class="bookquote">``How should we do?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``She (<font color='blue'><b>Dean</b></font>) went of her (<font color='blue'><b>Dean</b></font>) own accord,''  (<font color='red'><b>the master</b></font>)</div>answered the master; `she (<font color='blue'><b>Isabella</b></font>) had a right to go
if she (<font color='blue'><b>Isabella</b></font>) pleased. Trouble me no more about her (<font color='blue'><b>Isabella</b></font>). Hereafter she (<font color='blue'><b>Isabella</b></font>) is only my
sister in name: not because I disown her (<font color='blue'><b>Isabella</b></font>), but because she (<font color='blue'><b>Isabella</b></font>) has disowned
me.''

<p/>And that was all he (<font color='blue'><b>master</b></font>) said on the subject: he (<font color='blue'><b>master</b></font>) did not make single inquiry
further, or mention her (<font color='blue'><b>Isabella</b></font>) in any way, except directing me to send what
property she (<font color='blue'><b>Isabella</b></font>) had in the house to her (<font color='blue'><b>Isabella</b></font>) fresh home, wherever it was, when I
knew it.




<p/>CHAPTER XIII


<p/>For two months the fugitives remained absent; in those two months, Mrs.
Linton encountered and conquered the worst shock of what was denominated
a brain fever. No mother could have nursed an only child more devotedly
than Edgar tended her (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>). Day and night he (<font color='blue'><b>Edgar</b></font>) was watching, and patiently
enduring all the annoyances that irritable nerves and a shaken reason
could inflict; and, though Kenneth remarked that what he (<font color='blue'><b>Kenneth</b></font>) saved from the
grave would only recompense his (<font color='blue'><b>Kenneth</b></font>) care by forming the source of constant
future anxiety--in fact, that his (<font color='blue'><b>Kenneth</b></font>) health and strength were being
sacrificed to preserve a mere ruin of humanity--he (<font color='blue'><b>Kenneth</b></font>) knew no limits in
gratitude and joy when Catherine's life was declared out of danger; and
hour after hour he (<font color='blue'><b>Kenneth</b></font>) would sit beside her (<font color='blue'><b>Catherine</b></font>), tracing the gradual return to
bodily health, and flattering his (<font color='blue'><b>Kenneth</b></font>) too sanguine hopes with the illusion
that her (<font color='blue'><b>Catherine</b></font>) mind would settle back to its right balance also, and she (<font color='blue'><b>Catherine</b></font>) would
soon be entirely her (<font color='blue'><b>Catherine</b></font>) former self.

<p/>The first time she (<font color='blue'><b>Catherine</b></font>) left her (<font color='blue'><b>Catherine</b></font>) chamber was at the commencement of the
following March. Mr. Linton had put on her (<font color='blue'><b>Catherine</b></font>) pillow, in the morning, a
handful of golden crocuses; her (<font color='blue'><b>Catherine</b></font>) eye, long stranger to any gleam of
pleasure, caught them in waking, and shone delighted as she (<font color='blue'><b>Catherine</b></font>) gathered them
eagerly together.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``These are the earliest flowers at the Heights,''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Catherine</b></font>) exclaimed. <div class="bookquote">``They
remind me of soft thaw winds, and warm sunshine, and nearly melted snow.
Edgar, is there not a south wind, and is not the snow almost gone?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``The snow is quite gone down here, darling,''  (<font color='red'><b>husband</b></font>)</div>replied her (<font color='blue'><b>Catherine</b></font>) husband; `and I
only see two white spots on the whole range of moors: the sky is blue,
and the larks are singing, and the becks and brooks are all brim full.
Catherine, last spring at this time, I was longing to have you under this
roof; now, I wish you were a mile or two up those hills: the air blows so
sweetly, I feel that it would cure you.''

<p/><div class="bookquote">``I shall never be there but once more,''  (<font color='red'><b>me</b></font>)</div>said the invalid; `and then
you'll leave me, and I shall remain for ever. Next spring you'll long
again to have me under this roof, and you'll look back and think you were
happy to-day.''

<p/>Linton lavished on her (<font color='blue'><b>Linton</b></font>) the kindest caresses, and tried to cheer her (<font color='blue'><b>Linton</b></font>) by
the fondest words; but, vaguely regarding the flowers, she (<font color='blue'><b>Linton</b></font>) let the tears
collect on her (<font color='blue'><b>Linton</b></font>) lashes and stream down her (<font color='blue'><b>Linton</b></font>) cheeks unheeding. We knew she (<font color='blue'><b>Linton</b></font>)
was really better, and, therefore, decided that long confinement to a
single place produced much of this despondency, and it might be partially
removed by a change of scene. The master told me to light a fire in the
many-weeks' deserted parlour, and to set an easy-chair in the sunshine by
the window; and then he (<font color='blue'><b>master</b></font>) brought her (<font color='blue'><b>Linton</b></font>) down, and she (<font color='blue'><b>Linton</b></font>) sat a long while
enjoying the genial heat, and, as we expected, revived by the objects
round her (<font color='blue'><b>Linton</b></font>): which, though familiar, were free from the dreary associations
investing her (<font color='blue'><b>Linton</b></font>) hated sick chamber. By evening she (<font color='blue'><b>Linton</b></font>) seemed greatly
exhausted; yet no arguments could persuade her (<font color='blue'><b>Linton</b></font>) to return to that
apartment, and I had to arrange the parlour sofa for her (<font color='blue'><b>Linton</b></font>) bed, till
another room could be prepared. To obviate the fatigue of mounting and
descending the stairs, we fitted up this, where you lie at present--on
the same floor with the parlour; and she (<font color='blue'><b>Linton</b></font>) was soon strong enough to move
from one to the other, leaning on Edgar's arm. Ah, I thought myself, she (<font color='blue'><b>Linton</b></font>)
might recover, so waited on as she (<font color='blue'><b>Linton</b></font>) was. And there was double cause to
desire it, for on her (<font color='blue'><b>Linton</b></font>) existence depended that of another: we cherished
the hope that in a little while Mr. Linton's heart would be gladdened,
and his (<font color='blue'><b>Linton</b></font>) lands secured from a stranger's grip, by the birth of an heir.

<p/>I should mention that Isabella sent to her (<font color='blue'><b>Isabella</b></font>) brother, some six weeks from
her (<font color='blue'><b>Isabella</b></font>) departure, a short note, announcing her (<font color='blue'><b>Isabella</b></font>) marriage with Heathcliff. It
appeared dry and cold; but at the bottom was dotted in with pencil an
obscure apology, and an entreaty for kind remembrance and reconciliation,
if her (<font color='blue'><b>Isabella</b></font>) proceeding had offended him (<font color='blue'><b>Heathcliff</b></font>): asserting that she (<font color='blue'><b>Isabella</b></font>) could not help it
then, and being done, she (<font color='blue'><b>Isabella</b></font>) had now no power to repeal it. Linton did not
reply to this, I believe; and, in a fortnight more, I got a long letter,
which I considered odd, coming from the pen of a bride just out of the
honeymoon. I'll read it: for I keep it yet. Any relic of the dead is
precious, if they were valued living.

<p/>* * * * *

<p/>DEAR ELLEN, it begins,--I came last night to Wuthering Heights, and
heard, for the first time, that Catherine has been, and is yet, very ill.
I must not write to her (<font color='blue'><b>Catherine</b></font>), I suppose, and my brother is either too angry or
too distressed to answer what I sent him (<font color='blue'><b>brother</b></font>). Still, I must write to
somebody, and the only choice left me is you.

<p/>Inform Edgar that I'd give the world to see his (<font color='blue'><b>Edgar</b></font>) face again--that my heart
returned to Thrushcross Grange in twenty-four hours after I left it, and
is there at this moment, full of warm feelings for him (<font color='blue'><b>Edgar</b></font>), and Catherine! _I
can't follow it though_---LRB-these words are underlined-RRB---they need not
expect me, and they may draw what conclusions they please; taking care,
however, to lay nothing at the door of my weak will or deficient
affection.

<p/>The remainder of the letter is for yourself alone. I want to ask you two
questions: the first is,--How did you contrive to preserve the common
sympathies of human nature when you resided here? I cannot recognise any
sentiment which those around share with me.

<p/>The second question I have great interest in; it is this--Is Mr.
Heathcliff a man? If so, is he (<font color='blue'><b>Heathcliff</b></font>) mad? And if not, is he (<font color='blue'><b>Heathcliff</b></font>) a devil? I
sha'n't tell my reasons for making this inquiry; but I beseech you to
explain, if you can, what I have married: that is, when you call to see
me; and you must call, Ellen, very soon. Don't write, but come, and
bring me something from Edgar.

<p/>Now, you shall hear how I have been received in my new home, as I am led
to imagine the Heights will be. It is to amuse myself that I dwell on
such subjects as the lack of external comforts: they never occupy my
thoughts, except at the moment when I miss them. I should laugh and
dance for joy, if I found their absence was the total of my miseries, and
the rest was an unnatural dream!

<p/>The sun set behind the Grange as we turned on to the moors; by that, I
judged it to be six o'clock; and my companion halted half an hour, to
inspect the park, and the gardens, and, probably, the place itself, as
well as he (<font color='blue'><b>companion</b></font>) could; so it was dark when we dismounted in the paved yard of
the farm-house, and your old fellow-servant, Joseph, issued out to
receive us by the light of a dip candle. He (<font color='blue'><b>Joseph</b></font>) did it with a courtesy that
redounded to his (<font color='blue'><b>Joseph</b></font>) credit. His (<font color='blue'><b>Joseph</b></font>) first act was to elevate his (<font color='blue'><b>Joseph</b></font>) torch to a
level with my face, squint malignantly, project his (<font color='blue'><b>Joseph</b></font>) under-lip, and turn
away. Then he (<font color='blue'><b>Joseph</b></font>) took the two horses, and led them into the stables;
reappearing for the purpose of locking the outer gate, as if we lived in
an ancient castle.

<p/>Heathcliff stayed to speak to him (<font color='blue'><b>Heathcliff</b></font>), and I entered the kitchen--a dingy,
untidy hole; I daresay you would not know it, it is so changed since it
was in your charge. By the fire stood a ruffianly child, strong in limb
and dirty in garb, with a look of Catherine in his (<font color='blue'><b>Heathcliff</b></font>) eyes and about his (<font color='blue'><b>Heathcliff</b></font>)
mouth.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``This is Edgar's legal nephew,''  (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div>I reflected--`mine in a manner; I must
shake hands, and--yes--I must kiss him (<font color='blue'><b>Heathcliff</b></font>). It is right to establish a good
understanding at the beginning.''

<p/>I approached, and, attempting to take his (<font color='blue'><b>Heathcliff</b></font>) chubby fist, said--<div class="bookquote">``How do you
do, my dear?''

 (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div><p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Heathcliff</b></font>) replied in a jargon I did not comprehend.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Shall you and I be friends, Hareton?''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>was my next essay at conversation.

<p/>An oath, and a threat to set Throttler on me if I did not `frame off'
rewarded my perseverance.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Hey, Throttler, lad!''  (<font color='red'><b>the wretch</b></font>)</div>whispered the little wretch, rousing a half-bred
bull-dog from its lair in a corner. <div class="bookquote">``Now, wilt thou be ganging?''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Heathcliff</b></font>)
asked authoritatively.

<p/>Love for my life urged a compliance; I stepped over the threshold to wait
till the others should enter. Mr. Heathcliff was nowhere visible; and
Joseph, whom I followed to the stables, and requested to accompany me in,
after staring and muttering to himself, screwed up his (<font color='blue'><b>Joseph</b></font>) nose and
replied--<div class="bookquote">``Mim! mim! mim! Did iver Christian body hear aught like it?
Mincing un' munching! How can I tell whet ye say?''

 (<font color='red'><b>me</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I say, I wish you to come with me into the house!''  (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div>I cried, thinking him (<font color='blue'><b>Joseph</b></font>)
deaf, yet highly disgusted at his (<font color='blue'><b>Joseph</b></font>) rudeness.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``None o' me! I getten summut else to do,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Joseph</b></font>) answered, and continued his (<font color='blue'><b>Joseph</b></font>)
work; moving his (<font color='blue'><b>Joseph</b></font>) lantern jaws meanwhile, and surveying my dress and
countenance -LRB-the former a great deal too fine, but the latter, I'm sure,
as sad as he (<font color='blue'><b>Joseph</b></font>) could desire-RRB- with sovereign contempt.

<p/>I walked round the yard, and through a wicket, to another door, at which
I took the liberty of knocking, in hopes some more civil servant might
show himself. After a short suspense, it was opened by a tall, gaunt
man, without neckerchief, and otherwise extremely slovenly; his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) features
were lost in masses of shaggy hair that hung on his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) shoulders; and _his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>)_
eyes, too, were like a ghostly Catherine's with all their beauty
annihilated.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``What's your business here?''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) demanded, grimly. <div class="bookquote">``Who are you?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``My name was Isabella Linton,''  (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div>I replied. <div class="bookquote">``You've seen me before, sir.
I'm lately married to Mr. Heathcliff, and he (<font color='blue'><b>Heathcliff</b></font>) has brought me here--I
suppose, by your permission.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Is he (<font color='blue'><b>Heathcliff</b></font>) come back, then?''  (<font color='red'><b>a wolf</b></font>)</div>asked the hermit, glaring like a hungry wolf.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Yes--we came just now,''  (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div>I said; `but he (<font color='blue'><b>wolf</b></font>) left me by the kitchen door; and
when I would have gone in, your little boy played sentinel over the
place, and frightened me off by the help of a bull-dog.''

<p/><div class="bookquote">``It's well the hellish villain has kept his (<font color='blue'><b>villain</b></font>) word!''  (<font color='red'><b>me</b></font>)</div>growled my future
host, searching the darkness beyond me in expectation of discovering
Heathcliff; and then he (<font color='blue'><b>Heathcliff</b></font>) indulged in a soliloquy of execrations, and
threats of what he (<font color='blue'><b>Heathcliff</b></font>) would have done had the `fiend' deceived him (<font color='blue'><b>fiend</b></font>).

<p/>I repented having tried this second entrance, and was almost inclined to
slip away before he (<font color='blue'><b>fiend</b></font>) finished cursing, but ere I could execute that
intention, he (<font color='blue'><b>fiend</b></font>) ordered me in, and shut and re-fastened the door. There
was a great fire, and that was all the light in the huge apartment, whose
floor had grown a uniform grey; and the once brilliant pewter-dishes,
which used to attract my gaze when I was a girl, partook of a similar
obscurity, created by tarnish and dust. I inquired whether I might call
the maid, and be conducted to a bedroom! Mr. Earnshaw vouchsafed no
answer. He (<font color='blue'><b>Earnshaw</b></font>) walked up and down, with his (<font color='blue'><b>Earnshaw</b></font>) hands in his (<font color='blue'><b>Earnshaw</b></font>) pockets, apparently
quite forgetting my presence; and his (<font color='blue'><b>Earnshaw</b></font>) abstraction was evidently so deep,
and his (<font color='blue'><b>Earnshaw</b></font>) whole aspect so misanthropical, that I shrank from disturbing him (<font color='blue'><b>Earnshaw</b></font>)
again.

<p/>You'll not be surprised, Ellen, at my feeling particularly cheerless,
seated in worse than solitude on that inhospitable hearth, and
remembering that four miles distant lay my delightful home, containing
the only people I loved on earth; and there might as well be the
Atlantic to part us, instead of those four miles: I could not overpass
them! I questioned with myself--where must I turn for comfort? and--mind
you don't tell Edgar, or Catherine--above every sorrow beside, this rose
pre-eminent: despair at finding nobody who could or would be my ally
against Heathcliff! I had sought shelter at Wuthering Heights, almost
gladly, because I was secured by that arrangement from living alone with
him (<font color='blue'><b>Heathcliff</b></font>); but he (<font color='blue'><b>Heathcliff</b></font>) knew the people we were coming amongst, and he (<font color='blue'><b>Heathcliff</b></font>) did not fear
their intermeddling.

<p/>I sat and thought a doleful time: the clock struck eight, and nine, and
still my companion paced to and fro, his (<font color='blue'><b>companion</b></font>) head bent on his (<font color='blue'><b>companion</b></font>) breast, and
perfectly silent, unless a groan or a bitter ejaculation forced itself
out at intervals. I listened to detect a woman's voice in the house, and
filled the interim with wild regrets and dismal anticipations, which, at
last, spoke audibly in irrepressible sighing and weeping. I was not
aware how openly I grieved, till Earnshaw halted opposite, in his (<font color='blue'><b>companion</b></font>)
measured walk, and gave me a stare of newly-awakened surprise. Taking
advantage of his (<font color='blue'><b>companion</b></font>) recovered attention, I exclaimed--<div class="bookquote">``I'm tired with my
journey, and I want to go to bed! Where is the maid-servant? Direct me
to her (<font color='blue'><b>Linton</b></font>), as she (<font color='blue'><b>Linton</b></font>) won't come to me!''

 (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``We have none,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>companion</b></font>) answered; `you must wait on yourself!''

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Where must I sleep, then?''  (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div>I sobbed; I was beyond regarding
self-respect, weighed down by fatigue and wretchedness.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Joseph will show you Heathcliff's chamber,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>said he (<font color='blue'><b>companion</b></font>); `open that
door--he (<font color='blue'><b>companion</b></font>)'s in there.''

<p/>I was going to obey, but he (<font color='blue'><b>companion</b></font>) suddenly arrested me, and added in the
strangest tone--<div class="bookquote">``Be so good as to turn your lock, and draw your
bolt--don't omit it!''

 (<font color='red'><b>me</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Well!''  (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div>I said. <div class="bookquote">``But why, Mr. Earnshaw?''  (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div>I did not relish the notion of
deliberately fastening myself in with Heathcliff.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Look here!''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Heathcliff</b></font>) replied, pulling from his (<font color='blue'><b>Heathcliff</b></font>) waistcoat a
curiously-constructed pistol, having a double-edged spring knife attached
to the barrel. <div class="bookquote">``That's a great tempter to a desperate man, is it not? I
cannot resist going up with this every night, and trying his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) door. If
once I find it open he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>)'s done for; I do it invariably, even though the
minute before I have been recalling a hundred reasons that should make me
refrain: it is some devil that urges me to thwart my own schemes by
killing him (<font color='blue'><b>devil</b></font>). You fight against that devil for love as long as you may;
when the time comes, not all the angels in heaven shall save him (<font color='blue'><b>devil</b></font>)!''

 (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div><p/>I surveyed the weapon inquisitively. A hideous notion struck me: how
powerful I should be possessing such an instrument! I took it from his (<font color='blue'><b>Heathcliff</b></font>)
hand, and touched the blade. He (<font color='blue'><b>Heathcliff</b></font>) looked astonished at the expression my
face assumed during a brief second: it was not horror, it was
covetousness. He (<font color='blue'><b>Heathcliff</b></font>) snatched the pistol back, jealously; shut the knife,
and returned it to its concealment.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``I don't care if you tell him (<font color='blue'><b>devil</b></font>),''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>said he (<font color='blue'><b>Heathcliff</b></font>). <div class="bookquote">``Put him (<font color='blue'><b>devil</b></font>) on his (<font color='blue'><b>devil</b></font>) guard, and
watch for him (<font color='blue'><b>devil</b></font>). You know the terms we are on, I see: his (<font color='blue'><b>devil</b></font>) danger does not
shock you.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``What has Heathcliff done to you?''  (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div>I asked. <div class="bookquote">``In what has he (<font color='blue'><b>Heathcliff</b></font>) wronged you,
to warrant this appalling hatred? Wouldn't it be wiser to bid him (<font color='blue'><b>Heathcliff</b></font>) quit
the house?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``No!''  (<font color='red'><b>Catherine/Earnshaw/Catherine Earnshaw</b></font>)</div>thundered Earnshaw; `should he (<font color='blue'><b>Heathcliff</b></font>) offer to leave me, he (<font color='blue'><b>Heathcliff</b></font>)'s a dead man:
persuade him (<font color='blue'><b>Heathcliff</b></font>) to attempt it, and you are a murderess! Am I to lose _all_,
without a chance of retrieval? Is Hareton to be a beggar? Oh,
damnation! I _will_ have it back; and I'll have _his (<font color='blue'><b>beggar</b></font>)_ gold too; and then
his (<font color='blue'><b>beggar</b></font>) blood; and hell shall have his (<font color='blue'><b>beggar</b></font>) soul! It will be ten times blacker
with that guest than ever it was before!''

<p/>You've acquainted me, Ellen, with your old master's habits. He (<font color='blue'><b>master</b></font>) is
clearly on the verge of madness: he (<font color='blue'><b>master</b></font>) was so last night at least. I
shuddered to be near him (<font color='blue'><b>master</b></font>), and thought on the servant's ill-bred
moroseness as comparatively agreeable. He (<font color='blue'><b>master</b></font>) now recommenced his (<font color='blue'><b>master</b></font>) moody
walk, and I raised the latch, and escaped into the kitchen. Joseph was
bending over the fire, peering into a large pan that swung above it; and
a wooden bowl of oatmeal stood on the settle close by. The contents of
the pan began to boil, and he (<font color='blue'><b>Joseph</b></font>) turned to plunge his (<font color='blue'><b>Joseph</b></font>) hand into the bowl; I
conjectured that this preparation was probably for our supper, and, being
hungry, I resolved it should be eatable; so, crying out sharply, '_I'll_
make the porridge!'' I removed the vessel out of his (<font color='blue'><b>Joseph</b></font>) reach, and proceeded
to take off my hat and riding-habit. ``Mr. Earnshaw,<div class="bookquote">'' I continued,
`directs me to wait on myself: I will. I'm not going to act the lady
among you, for fear I should starve.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Earnshaw</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Gooid Lord!''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Joseph</b></font>) muttered, sitting down, and stroking his (<font color='blue'><b>Joseph</b></font>) ribbed
stockings from the knee to the ankle. <div class="bookquote">``If there's to be fresh
ortherings--just when I getten used to two maisters, if I mun hev' a
_mistress_ set o'er my heead, it's like time to be flitting. I niver
_did_ think to see t' day that I mud lave th' owld place--but I doubt
it's nigh at hand!''

 (<font color='red'><b>me</b></font>)</div><p/>This lamentation drew no notice from me: I went briskly to work, sighing
to remember a period when it would have been all merry fun; but compelled
speedily to drive off the remembrance. It racked me to recall past
happiness and the greater peril there was of conjuring up its apparition,
the quicker the thible ran round, and the faster the handfuls of meal
fell into the water. Joseph beheld my style of cookery with growing
indignation.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Thear!''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Joseph</b></font>) ejaculated. <div class="bookquote">``Hareton, thou willn't sup thy porridge
to-neeght; they'll be naught but lumps as big as my neive. Thear, agean!
I'd fling in bowl un' all, if I wer ye! There, pale t' guilp off, un'
then ye'll hae done wi' `t. Bang, bang. It's a mercy t' bothom isn't
deaved out!''

 (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div><p/>It _was_ rather a rough mess, I own, when poured into the basins; four
had been provided, and a gallon pitcher of new milk was brought from the
dairy, which Hareton seized and commenced drinking and spilling from the
expansive lip. I expostulated, and desired that he (<font color='blue'><b>Hareton</b></font>) should have his (<font color='blue'><b>Hareton</b></font>) in a
mug; affirming that I could not taste the liquid treated so dirtily. The
old cynic chose to be vastly offended at this nicety; assuring me,
repeatedly, that `the barn was every bit as good' as I, `and every bit as
wollsome,'' and wondering how I could fashion to be so conceited.
Meanwhile, the infant ruffian continued sucking; and glowered up at me
defyingly, as he (<font color='blue'><b>Hareton</b></font>) slavered into the jug.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``I shall have my supper in another room,''  (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div>I said. <div class="bookquote">``Have you no place you
call a parlour?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">''_Parlour_!''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Hareton</b></font>) echoed, sneeringly, '_parlour_! Nay, we've noa
_parlours_. If yah dunnut loike wer company, there's maister's; un' if
yah dunnut loike maister, there's us.''

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Then I shall go up-stairs,''  (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div>I answered; `show me a chamber.''

<p/>I put my basin on a tray, and went myself to fetch some more milk. With
great grumblings, the fellow rose, and preceded me in my ascent: we
mounted to the garrets; he (<font color='blue'><b>fellow</b></font>) opened a door, now and then, to look into the
apartments we passed.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Here's a rahm,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>fellow</b></font>) said, at last, flinging back a cranky board on
hinges. ``It's weel eneugh to ate a few porridge in. There's a pack o'
corn i' t' corner, thear, meeterly clane; if ye're feared o' muckying yer
grand silk cloes, spread yer hankerchir o' t' top on<div class="bookquote">``t.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/>The `rahm' was a kind of lumber-hole smelling strong of malt and grain;
various sacks of which articles were piled around, leaving a wide, bare
space in the middle.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Why, man,''  (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div>I exclaimed, facing him (<font color='blue'><b>fellow</b></font>) angrily, `this is not a place to
sleep in. I wish to see my bed-room.''

<p/><div class="bookquote">''_Bed-rume_!''  (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>fellow</b></font>) repeated, in a tone of mockery. <div class="bookquote">``Yah's see all t'
_bed-rumes_ thear is--yon's mine.''

 (<font color='red'><b>He</b></font>)</div><p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>fellow</b></font>) pointed into the second garret, only differing from the first in being
more naked about the walls, and having a large, low, curtainless bed,
with an indigo-coloured quilt, at one end.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``What do I want with yours?''  (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div>I retorted. <div class="bookquote">``I suppose Mr. Heathcliff does
not lodge at the top of the house, does he (<font color='blue'><b>Heathcliff</b></font>)?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Oh! it's Maister _Hathecliff's_ ye're wanting?''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>cried he (<font color='blue'><b>fellow</b></font>), as if making a
new discovery. <div class="bookquote">``Couldn't ye ha' said soa, at onst? un' then, I mud ha'
telled ye, baht all this wark, that that's just one ye cannut see--he (<font color='blue'><b>Maister</b></font>)
allas keeps it locked, un' nob`dy iver mells on't but hisseln.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``You've a nice house, Joseph,''  (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div>I could not refrain from observing, `and
pleasant inmates; and I think the concentrated essence of all the madness
in the world took up its abode in my brain the day I linked my fate with
theirs! However, that is not to the present purpose--there are other
rooms. For heaven's sake be quick, and let me settle somewhere!''

<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>fellow</b></font>) made no reply to this adjuration; only plodding doggedly down the
wooden steps, and halting, before an apartment which, from that halt and
the superior quality of its furniture, I conjectured to be the best one.
There was a carpet--a good one, but the pattern was obliterated by dust;
a fireplace hung with cut-paper, dropping to pieces; a handsome
oak-bedstead with ample crimson curtains of rather expensive material and
modern make; but they had evidently experienced rough usage: the
vallances hung in festoons, wrenched from their rings, and the iron rod
supporting them was bent in an arc on one side, causing the drapery to
trail upon the floor. The chairs were also damaged, many of them
severely; and deep indentations deformed the panels of the walls. I was
endeavouring to gather resolution for entering and taking possession,
when my fool of a guide announced,--``This here is t' maister<div class="bookquote">``s.''  (<font color='red'><b>fool</b></font>)</div>My
supper by this time was cold, my appetite gone, and my patience
exhausted. I insisted on being provided instantly with a place of
refuge, and means of repose.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Whear the divil?''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>began the religious elder. <div class="bookquote">``The Lord bless us! The
Lord forgie us! Whear the _hell_ wold ye gang? ye marred, wearisome
nowt! Ye've seen all but Hareton's bit of a cham`er. There's not
another hoile to lig down in i' th' hahse!''

 (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div><p/>I was so vexed, I flung my tray and its contents on the ground; and then
seated myself at the stairs'-head, hid my face in my hands, and cried.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Ech! ech!''  (<font color='red'><b>Joseph</b></font>)</div>exclaimed Joseph. ``Weel done, Miss Cathy! weel done, Miss
Cathy! Howsiver, t' maister sall just tum`le o'er them brooken pots; un'
then we's hear summut; we's hear how it's to be. Gooid-for-naught
madling! ye desarve pining fro' this to Chrustmas, flinging t' precious
gifts o<div class="bookquote">``God under fooit i' yer flaysome rages! But I'm mista'en if ye
shew yer sperrit lang. Will Hathecliff bide sich bonny ways, think ye? I
nobbut wish he (<font color='blue'><b>God</b></font>) may catch ye i' that plisky. I nobbut wish he (<font color='blue'><b>God</b></font>) may.''

 (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div><p/>And so he (<font color='blue'><b>Joseph</b></font>) went on scolding to his (<font color='blue'><b>Joseph</b></font>) den beneath, taking the candle with
him (<font color='blue'><b>Joseph</b></font>); and I remained in the dark. The period of reflection succeeding
this silly action compelled me to admit the necessity of smothering my
pride and choking my wrath, and bestirring myself to remove its effects.
An unexpected aid presently appeared in the shape of Throttler, whom I
now recognised as a son of our old Skulker: it had spent its whelphood
at the Grange, and was given by my father to Mr. Hindley. I fancy it
knew me: it pushed its nose against mine by way of salute, and then
hastened to devour the porridge; while I groped from step to step,
collecting the shattered earthenware, and drying the spatters of milk
from the banister with my pocket-handkerchief. Our labours were scarcely
over when I heard Earnshaw's tread in the passage; my assistant tucked
in his (<font color='blue'><b>assistant</b></font>) tail, and pressed to the wall; I stole into the nearest doorway.
The dog's endeavour to avoid him (<font color='blue'><b>assistant</b></font>) was unsuccessful; as I guessed by a
scutter down-stairs, and a prolonged, piteous yelping. I had better
luck: he (<font color='blue'><b>assistant</b></font>) passed on, entered his (<font color='blue'><b>assistant</b></font>) chamber, and shut the door. Directly
after Joseph came up with Hareton, to put him (<font color='blue'><b>Hareton</b></font>) to bed. I had found
shelter in Hareton's room, and the old man, on seeing me, said,--<div class="bookquote">``They's
rahm for boath ye un' yer pride, now, I sud think i' the hahse. It's
empty; ye may hev' it all to yerseln, un' Him (<font color='blue'><b>God</b></font>) as allus maks a third, i'
sich ill company!''

 (<font color='red'><b>me</b></font>)</div><p/>Gladly did I take advantage of this intimation; and the minute I flung
myself into a chair, by the fire, I nodded, and slept. My slumber was
deep and sweet, though over far too soon. Mr. Heathcliff awoke me; he (<font color='blue'><b>Heathcliff</b></font>)
had just come in, and demanded, in his (<font color='blue'><b>Heathcliff</b></font>) loving manner, what I was doing
there? I told him (<font color='blue'><b>Heathcliff</b></font>) the cause of my staying up so late--that he (<font color='blue'><b>Heathcliff</b></font>) had the
key of our room in his (<font color='blue'><b>Heathcliff</b></font>) pocket. The adjective _our_ gave mortal offence.
He (<font color='blue'><b>Heathcliff</b></font>) swore it was not, nor ever should be, mine; and he (<font color='blue'><b>Heathcliff</b></font>)'d--but I'll not
repeat his (<font color='blue'><b>Heathcliff</b></font>) language, nor describe his (<font color='blue'><b>Heathcliff</b></font>) habitual conduct: he (<font color='blue'><b>Heathcliff</b></font>) is ingenious
and unresting in seeking to gain my abhorrence! I sometimes wonder at
him (<font color='blue'><b>Heathcliff</b></font>) with an intensity that deadens my fear: yet, I assure you, a tiger or
a venomous serpent could not rouse terror in me equal to that which he (<font color='blue'><b>Heathcliff</b></font>)
wakens. He (<font color='blue'><b>Heathcliff</b></font>) told me of Catherine's illness, and accused my brother of
causing it promising that I should be Edgar's proxy in suffering, till he (<font color='blue'><b>Edgar</b></font>)
could get hold of him (<font color='blue'><b>Edgar</b></font>).

<p/>I do hate him (<font color='blue'><b>Edgar</b></font>)--I am wretched--I have been a fool! Beware of uttering one
breath of this to any one at the Grange. I shall expect you every
day--don't disappoint me!--ISABELLA.




<p/>CHAPTER XIV


<p/>As soon as I had perused this epistle I went to the master, and informed
him (<font color='blue'><b>master</b></font>) that his (<font color='blue'><b>master</b></font>) sister had arrived at the Heights, and sent me a letter
expressing her (<font color='blue'><b>sister</b></font>) sorrow for Mrs. Linton's situation, and her (<font color='blue'><b>sister</b></font>) ardent desire
to see him (<font color='blue'><b>master</b></font>); with a wish that he (<font color='blue'><b>master</b></font>) would transmit to her (<font color='blue'><b>sister</b></font>), as early as
possible, some token of forgiveness by me.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Forgiveness!''  (<font color='red'><b>Linton/Mrs. Linton/Mrs. Heathcliff</b></font>)</div>said Linton. <div class="bookquote">``I have nothing to forgive her (<font color='blue'><b>ye</b></font>), Ellen. You
may call at Wuthering Heights this afternoon, if you like, and say that I
am not angry, but I'm sorry to have lost her (<font color='blue'><b>Ellen</b></font>); especially as I can never
think she (<font color='blue'><b>Ellen</b></font>)'ll be happy. It is out of the question my going to see her (<font color='blue'><b>Ellen</b></font>),
however: we are eternally divided; and should she (<font color='blue'><b>Ellen</b></font>) really wish to oblige
me, let her (<font color='blue'><b>Ellen</b></font>) persuade the villain she (<font color='blue'><b>Ellen</b></font>) has married to leave the country.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``And you won't write her (<font color='blue'><b>Ellen</b></font>) a little note, sir?''  (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div>I asked, imploringly.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``No,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>master</b></font>) answered. <div class="bookquote">``It is needless. My communication with Heathcliff's
family shall be as sparing as his (<font color='blue'><b>Heathcliff</b></font>) with mine. It shall not exist!''

 (<font color='red'><b>Edgar/Mr. Edgar</b></font>)</div><p/>Mr. Edgar's coldness depressed me exceedingly; and all the way from the
Grange I puzzled my brains how to put more heart into what he (<font color='blue'><b>master</b></font>) said, when
I repeated it; and how to soften his (<font color='blue'><b>master</b></font>) refusal of even a few lines to
console Isabella. I daresay she (<font color='blue'><b>Isabella</b></font>) had been on the watch for me since
morning: I saw her (<font color='blue'><b>Isabella</b></font>) looking through the lattice as I came up the garden
causeway, and I nodded to her (<font color='blue'><b>Isabella</b></font>); but she (<font color='blue'><b>Isabella</b></font>) drew back, as if afraid of being
observed. I entered without knocking. There never was such a dreary,
dismal scene as the formerly cheerful house presented! I must confess,
that if I had been in the young lady's place, I would, at least, have
swept the hearth, and wiped the tables with a duster. But she (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) already
partook of the pervading spirit of neglect which encompassed her (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>). Her (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>)
pretty face was wan and listless; her (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) hair uncurled: some locks hanging
lankly down, and some carelessly twisted round her (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) head. Probably she (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>)
had not touched her (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) dress since yester evening. Hindley was not there.
Mr. Heathcliff sat at a table, turning over some papers in his (<font color='blue'><b>Heathcliff</b></font>)
pocket-book; but he (<font color='blue'><b>Heathcliff</b></font>) rose when I appeared, asked me how I did, quite
friendly, and offered me a chair. He (<font color='blue'><b>Heathcliff</b></font>) was the only thing there that
seemed decent; and I thought he (<font color='blue'><b>Heathcliff</b></font>) never looked better. So much had
circumstances altered their positions, that he (<font color='blue'><b>Heathcliff</b></font>) would certainly have
struck a stranger as a born and bred gentleman; and his (<font color='blue'><b>Heathcliff</b></font>) wife as a
thorough little slattern! She (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>) came forward eagerly to greet me, and held
out one hand to take the expected letter. I shook my head. She (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>) wouldn't
understand the hint, but followed me to a sideboard, where I went to lay
my bonnet, and importuned me in a whisper to give her (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>) directly what I
had brought. Heathcliff guessed the meaning of her (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>) manoeuvres, and
said--<div class="bookquote">``If you have got anything for Isabella -LRB-as no doubt you have,
Nelly-RRB-, give it to her (<font color='blue'><b>Isabella</b></font>). You needn't make a secret of it: we have no
secrets between us.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Heathcliff/Mr. Heathcliff</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Oh, I have nothing,''  (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div>I replied, thinking it best to speak the truth at
once. <div class="bookquote">``My master bid me tell his (<font color='blue'><b>master</b></font>) sister that she (<font color='blue'><b>sister</b></font>) must not expect either
a letter or a visit from him (<font color='blue'><b>master</b></font>) at present. He (<font color='blue'><b>master</b></font>) sends his (<font color='blue'><b>master</b></font>) love, ma'am, and
his (<font color='blue'><b>master</b></font>) wishes for your happiness, and his (<font color='blue'><b>master</b></font>) pardon for the grief you have
occasioned; but he (<font color='blue'><b>master</b></font>) thinks that after this time his (<font color='blue'><b>master</b></font>) household and the
household here should drop intercommunication, as nothing could come of
keeping it up.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Linton/Mrs. Linton/Mrs. Heathcliff</b></font>)</div><p/>Mrs. Heathcliff's lip quivered slightly, and she (<font color='blue'><b>Heathcliff</b></font>) returned to her (<font color='blue'><b>Heathcliff</b></font>) seat in
the window. Her (<font color='blue'><b>Heathcliff</b></font>) husband took his (<font color='blue'><b>husband</b></font>) stand on the hearthstone, near me, and
began to put questions concerning Catherine. I told him (<font color='blue'><b>husband</b></font>) as much as I
thought proper of her (<font color='blue'><b>Catherine</b></font>) illness, and he (<font color='blue'><b>husband</b></font>) extorted from me, by
cross-examination, most of the facts connected with its origin. I blamed
her (<font color='blue'><b>Catherine</b></font>), as she (<font color='blue'><b>Catherine</b></font>) deserved, for bringing it all on herself; and ended by hoping
that he (<font color='blue'><b>husband</b></font>) would follow Mr. Linton's example and avoid future interference
with his (<font color='blue'><b>husband</b></font>) family, for good or evil.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Mrs. Linton is now just recovering,''  (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div>I said; `she (<font color='blue'><b>Catherine</b></font>)'ll never be like she (<font color='blue'><b>Catherine</b></font>)
was, but her (<font color='blue'><b>Catherine</b></font>) life is spared; and if you really have a regard for her (<font color='blue'><b>Catherine</b></font>),
you'll shun crossing her (<font color='blue'><b>Catherine</b></font>) way again: nay, you'll move out of this country
entirely; and that you may not regret it, I'll inform you Catherine
Linton is as different now from your old friend Catherine Earnshaw, as
that young lady is different from me. Her (<font color='blue'><b>Earnshaw</b></font>) appearance is changed greatly,
her (<font color='blue'><b>Earnshaw</b></font>) character much more so; and the person who is compelled, of
necessity, to be her (<font color='blue'><b>Earnshaw</b></font>) companion, will only sustain his (<font color='blue'><b>companion</b></font>) affection hereafter
by the remembrance of what she (<font color='blue'><b>Earnshaw</b></font>) once was, by common humanity, and a sense
of duty!''

<p/><div class="bookquote">``That is quite possible,''  (<font color='red'><b>Heathcliff/Mr. Heathcliff</b></font>)</div>remarked Heathcliff, forcing himself to seem
calm: `quite possible that your master should have nothing but common
humanity and a sense of duty to fall back upon. But do you imagine that
I shall leave Catherine to his (<font color='blue'><b>master</b></font>) _duty_ and _humanity_? and can you compare
my feelings respecting Catherine to his (<font color='blue'><b>master</b></font>)? Before you leave this house, I
must exact a promise from you that you'll get me an interview with her (<font color='blue'><b>Catherine</b></font>):
consent, or refuse, I _will_ see her (<font color='blue'><b>Catherine</b></font>)! What do you say?''

<p/><div class="bookquote">``I say, Mr. Heathcliff,''  (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div>I replied, `you must not: you never shall,
through my means. Another encounter between you and the master would
kill her (<font color='blue'><b>Catherine</b></font>) altogether.''

<p/><div class="bookquote">``With your aid that may be avoided,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>master</b></font>) continued; `and should there be
danger of such an event--should he (<font color='blue'><b>master</b></font>) be the cause of adding a single
trouble more to her (<font color='blue'><b>Catherine</b></font>) existence--why, I think I shall be justified in going
to extremes! I wish you had sincerity enough to tell me whether
Catherine would suffer greatly from his (<font color='blue'><b>master</b></font>) loss: the fear that she (<font color='blue'><b>Catherine</b></font>) would
restrains me. And there you see the distinction between our feelings:
had he (<font color='blue'><b>master</b></font>) been in my place, and I in his (<font color='blue'><b>master</b></font>), though I hated him (<font color='blue'><b>master</b></font>) with a hatred
that turned my life to gall, I never would have raised a hand against
him (<font color='blue'><b>master</b></font>). You may look incredulous, if you please! I never would have
banished him (<font color='blue'><b>master</b></font>) from her (<font color='blue'><b>Catherine</b></font>) society as long as she (<font color='blue'><b>Catherine</b></font>) desired his (<font color='blue'><b>master</b></font>). The moment her (<font color='blue'><b>Catherine</b></font>)
regard ceased, I would have torn his (<font color='blue'><b>master</b></font>) heart out, and drunk his (<font color='blue'><b>master</b></font>) blood! But,
till then--if you don't believe me, you don't know me--till then, I would
have died by inches before I touched a single hair of his (<font color='blue'><b>master</b></font>) head!''

<p/><div class="bookquote">``And yet,''  (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div>I interrupted, `you have no scruples in completely ruining all
hopes of her (<font color='blue'><b>Catherine</b></font>) perfect restoration, by thrusting yourself into her (<font color='blue'><b>Catherine</b></font>)
remembrance now, when she (<font color='blue'><b>Catherine</b></font>) has nearly forgotten you, and involving her (<font color='blue'><b>Catherine</b></font>) in
a new tumult of discord and distress.''

<p/><div class="bookquote">``You suppose she (<font color='blue'><b>Linton</b></font>) has nearly forgotten me?''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>master</b></font>) said. <div class="bookquote">``Oh, Nelly! you know
she (<font color='blue'><b>Linton</b></font>) has not! You know as well as I do, that for every thought she (<font color='blue'><b>Linton</b></font>) spends
on Linton she (<font color='blue'><b>Linton</b></font>) spends a thousand on me! At a most miserable period of my
life, I had a notion of the kind: it haunted me on my return to the
neighbourhood last summer; but only her (<font color='blue'><b>Linton</b></font>) own assurance could make me admit
the horrible idea again. And then, Linton would be nothing, nor Hindley,
nor all the dreams that ever I dreamt. Two words would comprehend my
future--_death_ and _hell_: existence, after losing her (<font color='blue'><b>Linton</b></font>), would be hell.
Yet I was a fool to fancy for a moment that she (<font color='blue'><b>Linton</b></font>) valued Edgar Linton's
attachment more than mine. If he (<font color='blue'><b>Linton</b></font>) loved with all the powers of his (<font color='blue'><b>Linton</b></font>) puny
being, he (<font color='blue'><b>Linton</b></font>) couldn't love as much in eighty years as I could in a day. And
Catherine has a heart as deep as I have: the sea could be as readily
contained in that horse-trough as her (<font color='blue'><b>Catherine</b></font>) whole affection be monopolised by
him (<font color='blue'><b>Linton</b></font>). Tush! He (<font color='blue'><b>Linton</b></font>) is scarcely a degree dearer to her (<font color='blue'><b>Catherine</b></font>) than her (<font color='blue'><b>Catherine</b></font>) dog, or her (<font color='blue'><b>Catherine</b></font>)
horse. It is not in him (<font color='blue'><b>Linton</b></font>) to be loved like me: how can she (<font color='blue'><b>Catherine</b></font>) love in him (<font color='blue'><b>Linton</b></font>)
what he (<font color='blue'><b>Linton</b></font>) has not?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Catherine and Edgar are as fond of each other as any two people can be,''
 (<font color='red'><b>Isabella/Isabella Linton/ISABELLA</b></font>)</div>cried Isabella, with sudden vivacity. <div class="bookquote">``No one has a right to talk in
that manner, and I won't hear my brother depreciated in silence!''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Your brother is wondrous fond of you too, isn't he (<font color='blue'><b>brother</b></font>)?''  (<font color='red'><b>Heathcliff/Mr. Heathcliff</b></font>)</div>observed
Heathcliff, scornfully. <div class="bookquote">``He (<font color='blue'><b>brother</b></font>) turns you adrift on the world with
surprising alacrity.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``He (<font color='blue'><b>brother</b></font>) is not aware of what I suffer,''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Isabella</b></font>) replied. <div class="bookquote">``I didn't tell him (<font color='blue'><b>brother</b></font>)
that.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``You have been telling him (<font color='blue'><b>brother</b></font>) something, then: you have written, have you?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``To say that I was married, I did write--you saw the note.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``And nothing since?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``No.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``My young lady is looking sadly the worse for her (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) change of condition,''  (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div>I
remarked. <div class="bookquote">``Somebody's love comes short in her (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) case, obviously; whose, I
may guess; but, perhaps, I shouldn't say.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I should guess it was her (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) own,''  (<font color='red'><b>Heathcliff/Mr. Heathcliff</b></font>)</div>said Heathcliff. <div class="bookquote">``She (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) degenerates into
a mere slut! She (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) is tired of trying to please me uncommonly early. You'd
hardly credit it, but the very morrow of our wedding she (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) was weeping to
go home. However, she (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>)'ll suit this house so much the better for not
being over nice, and I'll take care she (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) does not disgrace me by rambling
abroad.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Well, sir,''  (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div>returned I, <div class="bookquote">``I hope you'll consider that Mrs. Heathcliff is
accustomed to be looked after and waited on; and that she (<font color='blue'><b>Heathcliff</b></font>) has been
brought up like an only daughter, whom every one was ready to serve. You
must let her (<font color='blue'><b>Heathcliff</b></font>) have a maid to keep things tidy about her (<font color='blue'><b>Heathcliff</b></font>), and you must
treat her (<font color='blue'><b>Heathcliff</b></font>) kindly. Whatever be your notion of Mr. Edgar, you cannot doubt
that she (<font color='blue'><b>Heathcliff</b></font>) has a capacity for strong attachments, or she (<font color='blue'><b>Heathcliff</b></font>) wouldn't have
abandoned the elegancies, and comforts, and friends of her (<font color='blue'><b>Heathcliff</b></font>) former home,
to fix contentedly, in such a wilderness as this, with you.''

 (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``She (<font color='blue'><b>Heathcliff</b></font>) abandoned them under a delusion,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Heathcliff</b></font>) answered; `picturing in me a
hero of romance, and expecting unlimited indulgences from my chivalrous
devotion. I can hardly regard her (<font color='blue'><b>Isabella</b></font>) in the light of a rational creature,
so obstinately has she (<font color='blue'><b>Isabella</b></font>) persisted in forming a fabulous notion of my
character and acting on the false impressions she (<font color='blue'><b>Isabella</b></font>) cherished. But, at
last, I think she (<font color='blue'><b>Isabella</b></font>) begins to know me: I don't perceive the silly smiles
and grimaces that provoked me at first; and the senseless incapability of
discerning that I was in earnest when I gave her (<font color='blue'><b>Isabella</b></font>) my opinion of her (<font color='blue'><b>Isabella</b></font>)
infatuation and herself. It was a marvellous effort of perspicacity to
discover that I did not love her (<font color='blue'><b>Isabella</b></font>). I believed, at one time, no lessons
could teach her (<font color='blue'><b>Isabella</b></font>) that! And yet it is poorly learnt; for this morning she (<font color='blue'><b>Isabella</b></font>)
announced, as a piece of appalling intelligence, that I had actually
succeeded in making her (<font color='blue'><b>Isabella</b></font>) hate me! A positive labour of Hercules, I assure
you! If it be achieved, I have cause to return thanks. Can I trust your
assertion, Isabella? Are you sure you hate me? If I let you alone for
half a day, won't you come sighing and wheedling to me again? I daresay
she (<font color='blue'><b>Isabella</b></font>) would rather I had seemed all tenderness before you: it wounds her (<font color='blue'><b>Isabella</b></font>)
vanity to have the truth exposed. But I don't care who knows that the
passion was wholly on one side: and I never told her (<font color='blue'><b>Isabella</b></font>) a lie about it. She (<font color='blue'><b>Isabella</b></font>)
cannot accuse me of showing one bit of deceitful softness. The first
thing she (<font color='blue'><b>Isabella</b></font>) saw me do, on coming out of the Grange, was to hang up her (<font color='blue'><b>Isabella</b></font>)
little dog; and when she (<font color='blue'><b>Isabella</b></font>) pleaded for it, the first words I uttered were a
wish that I had the hanging of every being belonging to her (<font color='blue'><b>Isabella</b></font>), except one:
possibly she (<font color='blue'><b>Isabella</b></font>) took that exception for herself. But no brutality disgusted
her (<font color='blue'><b>Isabella</b></font>): I suppose she (<font color='blue'><b>Isabella</b></font>) has an innate admiration of it, if only her (<font color='blue'><b>Isabella</b></font>) precious
person were secure from injury! Now, was it not the depth of
absurdity--of genuine idiotcy, for that pitiful, slavish, mean-minded
brach to dream that I could love her (<font color='blue'><b>Isabella</b></font>)? Tell your master, Nelly, that I
never, in all my life, met with such an abject thing as she (<font color='blue'><b>Isabella</b></font>) is. She (<font color='blue'><b>Isabella</b></font>) even
disgraces the name of Linton; and I've sometimes relented, from pure lack
of invention, in my experiments on what she (<font color='blue'><b>Linton</b></font>) could endure, and still creep
shamefully cringing back! But tell him (<font color='blue'><b>Nelly</b></font>), also, to set his (<font color='blue'><b>Nelly</b></font>) fraternal and
magisterial heart at ease: that I keep strictly within the limits of the
law. I have avoided, up to this period, giving her (<font color='blue'><b>Linton</b></font>) the slightest right
to claim a separation; and, what's more, she (<font color='blue'><b>Linton</b></font>)'d thank nobody for dividing
us. If she (<font color='blue'><b>Linton</b></font>) desired to go, she (<font color='blue'><b>Linton</b></font>) might: the nuisance of her (<font color='blue'><b>Linton</b></font>) presence
outweighs the gratification to be derived from tormenting her (<font color='blue'><b>Linton</b></font>)!''

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Mr. Heathcliff,''  (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div>said I, `this is the talk of a madman; your wife, most
likely, is convinced you are mad; and, for that reason, she (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>) has borne
with you hitherto: but now that you say she (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>) may go, she (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>)'ll doubtless
avail herself of the permission. You are not so bewitched, ma'am, are
you, as to remain with him (<font color='blue'><b>madman</b></font>) of your own accord?''

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Take care, Ellen!''  (<font color='red'><b>Isabella/Isabella Linton/ISABELLA</b></font>)</div>answered Isabella, her (<font color='blue'><b>Isabella</b></font>) eyes sparkling irefully; there
was no misdoubting by their expression the full success of her (<font color='blue'><b>Isabella</b></font>) partner's
endeavours to make himself detested. <div class="bookquote">``Don't put faith in a single word
he (<font color='blue'><b>Heathcliff</b></font>) speaks. He (<font color='blue'><b>Heathcliff</b></font>)'s a lying fiend! a monster, and not a human being! I've
been told I might leave him (<font color='blue'><b>Heathcliff</b></font>) before; and I've made the attempt, but I dare
not repeat it! Only, Ellen, promise you'll not mention a syllable of his (<font color='blue'><b>Heathcliff</b></font>)
infamous conversation to my brother or Catherine. Whatever he (<font color='blue'><b>Heathcliff</b></font>) may
pretend, he (<font color='blue'><b>Heathcliff</b></font>) wishes to provoke Edgar to desperation: he (<font color='blue'><b>Heathcliff</b></font>) says he (<font color='blue'><b>Heathcliff</b></font>) has
married me on purpose to obtain power over him (<font color='blue'><b>Heathcliff</b></font>); and he (<font color='blue'><b>Heathcliff</b></font>) sha'n't obtain
it--I'll die first! I just hope, I pray, that he (<font color='blue'><b>Heathcliff</b></font>) may forget his (<font color='blue'><b>Heathcliff</b></font>)
diabolical prudence and kill me! The single pleasure I can imagine is to
die, or to see him (<font color='blue'><b>Heathcliff</b></font>) dead!''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``There--that will do for the present!''  (<font color='red'><b>Heathcliff/Mr. Heathcliff</b></font>)</div>said Heathcliff. <div class="bookquote">``If you are
called upon in a court of law, you'll remember her (<font color='blue'><b>I</b></font>) language, Nelly! And
take a good look at that countenance: she (<font color='blue'><b>I</b></font>)'s near the point which would
suit me. No; you're not fit to be your own guardian, Isabella, now; and
I, being your legal protector, must retain you in my custody, however
distasteful the obligation may be. Go up-stairs; I have something to say
to Ellen Dean in private. That's not the way: up-stairs, I tell you!
Why, this is the road upstairs, child!''

 (<font color='red'><b>He</b></font>)</div><p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Heathcliff</b></font>) seized, and thrust her (<font color='blue'><b>Isabella</b></font>) from the room; and returned muttering--<div class="bookquote">``I have
no pity! I have no pity! The more the worms writhe, the more I yearn to
crush out their entrails! It is a moral teething; and I grind with
greater energy in proportion to the increase of pain.''

 (<font color='red'><b>He</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Do you understand what the word pity means?''  (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div>I said, hastening to resume
my bonnet. <div class="bookquote">``Did you ever feel a touch of it in your life?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Put that down!''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Heathcliff</b></font>) interrupted, perceiving my intention to depart. <div class="bookquote">``You
are not going yet. Come here now, Nelly: I must either persuade or
compel you to aid me in fulfilling my determination to see Catherine, and
that without delay. I swear that I meditate no harm: I don't desire to
cause any disturbance, or to exasperate or insult Mr. Linton; I only wish
to hear from herself how she (<font color='blue'><b>Catherine</b></font>) is, and why she (<font color='blue'><b>Catherine</b></font>) has been ill; and to ask if
anything that I could do would be of use to her (<font color='blue'><b>Catherine</b></font>). Last night I was in the
Grange garden six hours, and I'll return there to-night; and every night
I'll haunt the place, and every day, till I find an opportunity of
entering. If Edgar Linton meets me, I shall not hesitate to knock him (<font color='blue'><b>Linton</b></font>)
down, and give him (<font color='blue'><b>Linton</b></font>) enough to insure his (<font color='blue'><b>Linton</b></font>) quiescence while I stay. If his (<font color='blue'><b>Linton</b></font>)
servants oppose me, I shall threaten them off with these pistols. But
wouldn't it be better to prevent my coming in contact with them, or their
master? And you could do it so easily. I'd warn you when I came, and
then you might let me in unobserved, as soon as she (<font color='blue'><b>master</b></font>) was alone, and watch
till I departed, your conscience quite calm: you would be hindering
mischief.''

startles her (<font color='blue'><b>master</b></font>) painfully,''  (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div>I said. <div class="bookquote">``She (<font color='blue'><b>master</b></font>)'s all nerves, and she (<font color='blue'><b>master</b></font>) couldn't
bear the surprise, I'm positive. Don't persist, sir! or else I shall be
obliged to inform my master of your designs; and he (<font color='blue'><b>master</b></font>)'ll take measures to
secure his (<font color='blue'><b>master</b></font>) house and its inmates from any such unwarrantable intrusions!''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``In that case I'll take measures to secure you, woman!''  (<font color='red'><b>Heathcliff/Mr. Heathcliff</b></font>)</div>exclaimed
Heathcliff; `you shall not leave Wuthering Heights till to-morrow
morning. It is a foolish story to assert that Catherine could not bear
to see me; and as to surprising her (<font color='blue'><b>Catherine</b></font>), I don't desire it: you must prepare
her (<font color='blue'><b>Catherine</b></font>)--ask her (<font color='blue'><b>Catherine</b></font>) if I may come. You say she (<font color='blue'><b>Catherine</b></font>) never mentions my name, and that
I am never mentioned to her (<font color='blue'><b>Catherine</b></font>). To whom should she (<font color='blue'><b>Catherine</b></font>) mention me if I am a
forbidden topic in the house? She (<font color='blue'><b>Catherine</b></font>) thinks you are all spies for her (<font color='blue'><b>Catherine</b></font>)
husband. Oh, I've no doubt she (<font color='blue'><b>Catherine</b></font>)'s in hell among you! I guess by her (<font color='blue'><b>Catherine</b></font>)
silence, as much as anything, what she (<font color='blue'><b>Catherine</b></font>) feels. You say she (<font color='blue'><b>Catherine</b></font>) is often
restless, and anxious-looking: is that a proof of tranquillity? You talk
of her (<font color='blue'><b>Catherine</b></font>) mind being unsettled. How the devil could it be otherwise in her (<font color='blue'><b>Catherine</b></font>)
frightful isolation? And that insipid, paltry creature attending her (<font color='blue'><b>Catherine</b></font>)
from _duty_ and _humanity_! From _pity_ and _charity_! He (<font color='blue'><b>devil</b></font>) might as well
plant an oak in a flower-pot, and expect it to thrive, as imagine he (<font color='blue'><b>devil</b></font>) can
restore her (<font color='blue'><b>Catherine</b></font>) to vigour in the soil of his (<font color='blue'><b>devil</b></font>) shallow cares? Let us settle it
at once: will you stay here, and am I to fight my way to Catherine over
Linton and his (<font color='blue'><b>devil</b></font>) footman? Or will you be my friend, as you have been
hitherto, and do what I request? Decide! because there is no reason for
my lingering another minute, if you persist in your stubborn ill-nature!''

<p/>Well, Mr. Lockwood, I argued and complained, and flatly refused him (<font color='blue'><b>Lockwood</b></font>) fifty
times; but in the long run he (<font color='blue'><b>Lockwood</b></font>) forced me to an agreement. I engaged to
carry a letter from him (<font color='blue'><b>Lockwood</b></font>) to my mistress; and should she (<font color='blue'><b>mistress</b></font>) consent, I
promised to let him (<font color='blue'><b>Lockwood</b></font>) have intelligence of Linton's next absence from home,
when he (<font color='blue'><b>Lockwood</b></font>) might come, and get in as he (<font color='blue'><b>Lockwood</b></font>) was able: I wouldn't be there, and
my fellow-servants should be equally out of the way. Was it right or
wrong? I fear it was wrong, though expedient. I thought I prevented
another explosion by my compliance; and I thought, too, it might create a
favourable crisis in Catherine's mental illness: and then I remembered
Mr. Edgar's stern rebuke of my carrying tales; and I tried to smooth away
all disquietude on the subject, by affirming, with frequent iteration,
that that betrayal of trust, if it merited so harsh an appellation,
should be the last. Notwithstanding, my journey homeward was sadder than
my journey thither; and many misgivings I had, ere I could prevail on
myself to put the missive into Mrs. Linton's hand.

<p/>But here is Kenneth; I'll go down, and tell him (<font color='blue'><b>Kenneth</b></font>) how much better you are.
My history is _dree_, as we say, and will serve to while away another
morning.

<p/>Dree, and dreary! I reflected as the good woman descended to receive the
doctor: and not exactly of the kind which I should have chosen to amuse
me. But never mind! I'll extract wholesome medicines from Mrs. Dean's
bitter herbs; and firstly, let me beware of the fascination that lurks in
Catherine Heathcliff's brilliant eyes. I should be in a curious taking
if I surrendered my heart to that young person, and the daughter turned
out a second edition of the mother.




<p/>CHAPTER XV


<p/>Another week over--and I am so many days nearer health, and spring! I
have now heard all my neighbour's history, at different sittings, as the
housekeeper could spare time from more important occupations. I'll
continue it in her (<font color='blue'><b>housekeeper</b></font>) own words, only a little condensed. She (<font color='blue'><b>housekeeper</b></font>) is, on the
whole, a very fair narrator, and I don't think I could improve her (<font color='blue'><b>housekeeper</b></font>) style.

<p/>In the evening, she (<font color='blue'><b>housekeeper</b></font>) said, the evening of my visit to the Heights, I knew,
as well as if I saw him (<font color='blue'><b>narrator</b></font>), that Mr. Heathcliff was about the place; and I
shunned going out, because I still carried his (<font color='blue'><b>Heathcliff</b></font>) letter in my pocket, and
didn't want to be threatened or teased any more. I had made up my mind
not to give it till my master went somewhere, as I could not guess how
its receipt would affect Catherine. The consequence was, that it did not
reach her (<font color='blue'><b>Catherine</b></font>) before the lapse of three days. The fourth was Sunday, and I
brought it into her (<font color='blue'><b>Catherine</b></font>) room after the family were gone to church. There was
a manservant left to keep the house with me, and we generally made a
practice of locking the doors during the hours of service; but on that
occasion the weather was so warm and pleasant that I set them wide open,
and, to fulfil my engagement, as I knew who would be coming, I told my
companion that the mistress wished very much for some oranges, and he (<font color='blue'><b>companion</b></font>)
must run over to the village and get a few, to be paid for on the morrow.
He (<font color='blue'><b>companion</b></font>) departed, and I went up-stairs.

<p/>Mrs. Linton sat in a loose white dress, with a light shawl over her (<font color='blue'><b>Linton</b></font>)
shoulders, in the recess of the open window, as usual. Her (<font color='blue'><b>Linton</b></font>) thick, long
hair had been partly removed at the beginning of her (<font color='blue'><b>Linton</b></font>) illness, and now she (<font color='blue'><b>Linton</b></font>)
wore it simply combed in its natural tresses over her (<font color='blue'><b>Linton</b></font>) temples and neck.
Her (<font color='blue'><b>Linton</b></font>) appearance was altered, as I had told Heathcliff; but when she (<font color='blue'><b>Linton</b></font>) was
calm, there seemed unearthly beauty in the change. The flash of her (<font color='blue'><b>Linton</b></font>) eyes
had been succeeded by a dreamy and melancholy softness; they no longer
gave the impression of looking at the objects around her (<font color='blue'><b>Linton</b></font>): they appeared
always to gaze beyond, and far beyond--you would have said out of this
world. Then, the paleness of her (<font color='blue'><b>Linton</b></font>) face--its haggard aspect having
vanished as she (<font color='blue'><b>Linton</b></font>) recovered flesh--and the peculiar expression arising from
her (<font color='blue'><b>Linton</b></font>) mental state, though painfully suggestive of their causes, added to
the touching interest which she (<font color='blue'><b>Linton</b></font>) awakened; and--invariably to me, I know,
and to any person who saw her (<font color='blue'><b>Linton</b></font>), I should think--refuted more tangible
proofs of convalescence, and stamped her (<font color='blue'><b>Linton</b></font>) as one doomed to decay.

<p/>A book lay spread on the sill before her (<font color='blue'><b>Linton</b></font>), and the scarcely perceptible
wind fluttered its leaves at intervals. I believe Linton had laid it
there: for she (<font color='blue'><b>Linton</b></font>) never endeavoured to divert herself with reading, or
occupation of any kind, and he (<font color='blue'><b>Linton</b></font>) would spend many an hour in trying to
entice her (<font color='blue'><b>Linton</b></font>) attention to some subject which had formerly been her (<font color='blue'><b>Linton</b></font>)
amusement. She (<font color='blue'><b>Linton</b></font>) was conscious of his (<font color='blue'><b>Linton</b></font>) aim, and in her (<font color='blue'><b>Linton</b></font>) better moods endured
his (<font color='blue'><b>Linton</b></font>) efforts placidly, only showing their uselessness by now and then
suppressing a wearied sigh, and checking him (<font color='blue'><b>Linton</b></font>) at last with the saddest of
smiles and kisses. At other times, she (<font color='blue'><b>Linton</b></font>) would turn petulantly away, and
hide her (<font color='blue'><b>Linton</b></font>) face in her (<font color='blue'><b>Linton</b></font>) hands, or even push him (<font color='blue'><b>Linton</b></font>) off angrily; and then he (<font color='blue'><b>Linton</b></font>)
took care to let her (<font color='blue'><b>Linton</b></font>) alone, for he (<font color='blue'><b>Linton</b></font>) was certain of doing no good.

<p/>Gimmerton chapel bells were still ringing; and the full, mellow flow of
the beck in the valley came soothingly on the ear. It was a sweet
substitute for the yet absent murmur of the summer foliage, which drowned
that music about the Grange when the trees were in leaf. At Wuthering
Heights it always sounded on quiet days following a great thaw or a
season of steady rain. And of Wuthering Heights Catherine was thinking
as she (<font color='blue'><b>Catherine</b></font>) listened: that is, if she (<font color='blue'><b>Catherine</b></font>) thought or listened at all; but she (<font color='blue'><b>Catherine</b></font>) had
the vague, distant look I mentioned before, which expressed no
recognition of material things either by ear or eye.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``There's a letter for you, Mrs. Linton,''  (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div>I said, gently inserting it in
one hand that rested on her (<font color='blue'><b>Catherine</b></font>) knee. <div class="bookquote">``You must read it immediately, because
it wants an answer. Shall I break the seal?''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``Yes,''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Catherine</b></font>) answered,
without altering the direction of her (<font color='blue'><b>Catherine</b></font>) eyes. I opened it--it was very
short. <div class="bookquote">``Now,''  (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div>I continued, `read it.'' She (<font color='blue'><b>Catherine</b></font>) drew away her (<font color='blue'><b>Catherine</b></font>) hand, and let
it fall. I replaced it in her (<font color='blue'><b>Catherine</b></font>) lap, and stood waiting till it should
please her (<font color='blue'><b>Catherine</b></font>) to glance down; but that movement was so long delayed that at
last I resumed--<div class="bookquote">``Must I read it, ma'am? It is from Mr. Heathcliff.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/>There was a start and a troubled gleam of recollection, and a struggle to
arrange her (<font color='blue'><b>Catherine</b></font>) ideas. She (<font color='blue'><b>Catherine</b></font>) lifted the letter, and seemed to peruse it; and
when she (<font color='blue'><b>Catherine</b></font>) came to the signature she (<font color='blue'><b>Catherine</b></font>) sighed: yet still I found she (<font color='blue'><b>Catherine</b></font>) had not
gathered its import, for, upon my desiring to hear her (<font color='blue'><b>Catherine</b></font>) reply, she (<font color='blue'><b>Catherine</b></font>) merely
pointed to the name, and gazed at me with mournful and questioning
eagerness.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Well, he (<font color='blue'><b>Heathcliff</b></font>) wishes to see you,''  (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div>said I, guessing her (<font color='blue'><b>Catherine</b></font>) need of an
interpreter. <div class="bookquote">``He (<font color='blue'><b>Heathcliff</b></font>)'s in the garden by this time, and impatient to know
what answer I shall bring.''

 (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div><p/>As I spoke, I observed a large dog lying on the sunny grass beneath raise
its ears as if about to bark, and then smoothing them back, announce, by
a wag of the tail, that some one approached whom it did not consider a
stranger. Mrs. Linton bent forward, and listened breathlessly. The
minute after a step traversed the hall; the open house was too tempting
for Heathcliff to resist walking in: most likely he (<font color='blue'><b>Heathcliff</b></font>) supposed that I was
inclined to shirk my promise, and so resolved to trust to his (<font color='blue'><b>Heathcliff</b></font>) own
audacity. With straining eagerness Catherine gazed towards the entrance
of her (<font color='blue'><b>Catherine</b></font>) chamber. He (<font color='blue'><b>Heathcliff</b></font>) did not hit the right room directly: she (<font color='blue'><b>Catherine</b></font>) motioned me
to admit him (<font color='blue'><b>Heathcliff</b></font>), but he (<font color='blue'><b>Heathcliff</b></font>) found it out ere I could reach the door, and in a
stride or two was at her (<font color='blue'><b>Catherine</b></font>) side, and had her (<font color='blue'><b>Catherine</b></font>) grasped in his (<font color='blue'><b>Heathcliff</b></font>) arms.

<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Heathcliff</b></font>) neither spoke nor loosed his (<font color='blue'><b>Heathcliff</b></font>) hold for some five minutes, during which
period he (<font color='blue'><b>Heathcliff</b></font>) bestowed more kisses than ever he (<font color='blue'><b>Heathcliff</b></font>) gave in his (<font color='blue'><b>Heathcliff</b></font>) life before, I
daresay: but then my mistress had kissed him (<font color='blue'><b>Heathcliff</b></font>) first, and I plainly saw
that he (<font color='blue'><b>Heathcliff</b></font>) could hardly bear, for downright agony, to look into her (<font color='blue'><b>mistress</b></font>) face!
The same conviction had stricken him (<font color='blue'><b>Heathcliff</b></font>) as me, from the instant he (<font color='blue'><b>Heathcliff</b></font>) beheld
her (<font color='blue'><b>mistress</b></font>), that there was no prospect of ultimate recovery there--she (<font color='blue'><b>mistress</b></font>) was
fated, sure to die.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Oh, Cathy! Oh, my life! how can I bear it?''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>was the first sentence he (<font color='blue'><b>Heathcliff</b></font>)
uttered, in a tone that did not seek to disguise his (<font color='blue'><b>Heathcliff</b></font>) despair. And now he (<font color='blue'><b>Heathcliff</b></font>)
stared at her (<font color='blue'><b>mistress</b></font>) so earnestly that I thought the very intensity of his (<font color='blue'><b>Heathcliff</b></font>) gaze
would bring tears into his (<font color='blue'><b>Heathcliff</b></font>) eyes; but they burned with anguish: they did
not melt.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``What now?''  (<font color='red'><b>Catherine/Earnshaw/Catherine Earnshaw</b></font>)</div>said Catherine, leaning back, and returning his (<font color='blue'><b>Heathcliff</b></font>) look with a
suddenly clouded brow: her (<font color='blue'><b>Catherine</b></font>) humour was a mere vane for constantly varying
caprices. <div class="bookquote">``You and Edgar have broken my heart, Heathcliff! And you both
come to bewail the deed to me, as if you were the people to be pitied! I
shall not pity you, not I. You have killed me--and thriven on it, I
think. How strong you are! How many years do you mean to live after I
am gone?''

 (<font color='red'><b>Heathcliff/Mr. Heathcliff</b></font>)</div><p/>Heathcliff had knelt on one knee to embrace her (<font color='blue'><b>Catherine</b></font>); he (<font color='blue'><b>Heathcliff</b></font>) attempted to rise,
but she (<font color='blue'><b>Catherine</b></font>) seized his (<font color='blue'><b>Heathcliff</b></font>) hair, and kept him (<font color='blue'><b>Heathcliff</b></font>) down.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``I wish I could hold you,''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Catherine</b></font>) continued, bitterly, 'till we were both
dead! I shouldn't care what you suffered. I care nothing for your
sufferings. Why shouldn't you suffer? I do! Will you forget me? Will
you be happy when I am in the earth? Will you say twenty years hence,
<div class="bookquote">``That's the grave of Catherine Earnshaw? I loved her (<font color='blue'><b>Earnshaw</b></font>) long ago, and was
wretched to lose her (<font color='blue'><b>Earnshaw</b></font>); but it is past. I've loved many others since: my
children are dearer to me than she (<font color='blue'><b>Earnshaw</b></font>) was; and, at death, I shall not
rejoice that I am going to her (<font color='blue'><b>Earnshaw</b></font>): I shall be sorry that I must leave
them!''  (<font color='red'><b>Heathcliff/Mr. Heathcliff</b></font>)</div>Will you say so, Heathcliff?''

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Don't torture me till I'm as mad as yourself,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>cried he (<font color='blue'><b>Heathcliff</b></font>), wrenching his (<font color='blue'><b>Heathcliff</b></font>)
head free, and grinding his (<font color='blue'><b>Heathcliff</b></font>) teeth.

<p/>The two, to a cool spectator, made a strange and fearful picture. Well
might Catherine deem that heaven would be a land of exile to her (<font color='blue'><b>Catherine</b></font>), unless
with her (<font color='blue'><b>Catherine</b></font>) mortal body she (<font color='blue'><b>Catherine</b></font>) cast away her (<font color='blue'><b>Catherine</b></font>) moral character also. Her (<font color='blue'><b>Catherine</b></font>) present
countenance had a wild vindictiveness in its white cheek, and a bloodless
lip and scintillating eye; and she (<font color='blue'><b>Catherine</b></font>) retained in her (<font color='blue'><b>Catherine</b></font>) closed fingers a
portion of the locks she (<font color='blue'><b>Catherine</b></font>) had been grasping. As to her (<font color='blue'><b>Catherine</b></font>) companion, while
raising himself with one hand, he (<font color='blue'><b>companion</b></font>) had taken her (<font color='blue'><b>Catherine</b></font>) arm with the other; and
so inadequate was his (<font color='blue'><b>companion</b></font>) stock of gentleness to the requirements of her (<font color='blue'><b>Catherine</b></font>)
condition, that on his (<font color='blue'><b>companion</b></font>) letting go I saw four distinct impressions left
blue in the colourless skin.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Are you possessed with a devil,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>companion</b></font>) pursued, savagely, `to talk in that
manner to me when you are dying? Do you reflect that all those words
will be branded in my memory, and eating deeper eternally after you have
left me? You know you lie to say I have killed you: and, Catherine, you
know that I could as soon forget you as my existence! Is it not
sufficient for your infernal selfishness, that while you are at peace I
shall writhe in the torments of hell?''

<p/><div class="bookquote">``I shall not be at peace,''  (<font color='red'><b>Catherine/Earnshaw/Catherine Earnshaw</b></font>)</div>moaned Catherine, recalled to a sense of
physical weakness by the violent, unequal throbbing of her (<font color='blue'><b>Catherine</b></font>) heart, which
beat visibly and audibly under this excess of agitation. She (<font color='blue'><b>Catherine</b></font>) said
nothing further till the paroxysm was over; then she (<font color='blue'><b>Catherine</b></font>) continued, more
kindly--

<p/><div class="bookquote">``I'm not wishing you greater torment than I have, Heathcliff. I only
wish us never to be parted: and should a word of mine distress you
hereafter, think I feel the same distress underground, and for my own
sake, forgive me! Come here and kneel down again! You never harmed me
in your life. Nay, if you nurse anger, that will be worse to remember
than my harsh words! Won't you come here again? Do!''

 (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div><p/>Heathcliff went to the back of her (<font color='blue'><b>Catherine</b></font>) chair, and leant over, but not so far
as to let her (<font color='blue'><b>Catherine</b></font>) see his (<font color='blue'><b>Heathcliff</b></font>) face, which was livid with emotion. She (<font color='blue'><b>Catherine</b></font>) bent round
to look at him (<font color='blue'><b>Heathcliff</b></font>); he (<font color='blue'><b>Heathcliff</b></font>) would not permit it: turning abruptly, he (<font color='blue'><b>Heathcliff</b></font>) walked to
the fireplace, where he (<font color='blue'><b>Heathcliff</b></font>) stood, silent, with his (<font color='blue'><b>Heathcliff</b></font>) back towards us. Mrs.
Linton's glance followed him (<font color='blue'><b>Heathcliff</b></font>) suspiciously: every movement woke a new
sentiment in her (<font color='blue'><b>Linton</b></font>). After a pause and a prolonged gaze, she (<font color='blue'><b>Linton</b></font>) resumed;
addressing me in accents of indignant disappointment:--

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Oh, you see, Nelly, he (<font color='blue'><b>Nelly</b></font>) would not relent a moment to keep me out of the
grave. _That_ is how I'm loved! Well, never mind. That is not _my_
Heathcliff. I shall love mine yet; and take him (<font color='blue'><b>Heathcliff</b></font>) with me: he (<font color='blue'><b>Heathcliff</b></font>)'s in my
soul. And,''  (<font color='red'><b>me</b></font>)</div>added she (<font color='blue'><b>Linton</b></font>) musingly, `the thing that irks me most is this
shattered prison, after all. I'm tired of being enclosed here. I'm
wearying to escape into that glorious world, and to be always there: not
seeing it dimly through tears, and yearning for it through the walls of
an aching heart: but really with it, and in it. Nelly, you think you are
better and more fortunate than I; in full health and strength: you are
sorry for me--very soon that will be altered. I shall be sorry for
_you_. I shall be incomparably beyond and above you all. I _wonder_ he (<font color='blue'><b>Nelly</b></font>)
won't be near me!'' She (<font color='blue'><b>Nelly</b></font>) went on to herself. <div class="bookquote">``I thought he (<font color='blue'><b>Heathcliff</b></font>) wished it.
Heathcliff, dear! you should not be sullen now. Do come to me,
Heathcliff.''

 (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div><p/>In her (<font color='blue'><b>Nelly</b></font>) eagerness she (<font color='blue'><b>Nelly</b></font>) rose and supported herself on the arm of the chair.
At that earnest appeal he (<font color='blue'><b>Nelly</b></font>) turned to her (<font color='blue'><b>Nelly</b></font>), looking absolutely desperate.
His (<font color='blue'><b>Nelly</b></font>) eyes, wide and wet, at last flashed fiercely on her (<font color='blue'><b>Nelly</b></font>); his (<font color='blue'><b>Nelly</b></font>) breast
heaved convulsively. An instant they held asunder, and then how they met
I hardly saw, but Catherine made a spring, and he (<font color='blue'><b>Nelly</b></font>) caught her (<font color='blue'><b>Catherine</b></font>), and they
were locked in an embrace from which I thought my mistress would never be
released alive: in fact, to my eyes, she (<font color='blue'><b>mistress</b></font>) seemed directly insensible. He (<font color='blue'><b>Nelly</b></font>)
flung himself into the nearest seat, and on my approaching hurriedly to
ascertain if she (<font color='blue'><b>mistress</b></font>) had fainted, he (<font color='blue'><b>Nelly</b></font>) gnashed at me, and foamed like a mad
dog, and gathered her (<font color='blue'><b>mistress</b></font>) to him (<font color='blue'><b>Nelly</b></font>) with greedy jealousy. I did not feel as if
I were in the company of a creature of my own species: it appeared that
he (<font color='blue'><b>Nelly</b></font>) would not understand, though I spoke to him (<font color='blue'><b>Nelly</b></font>); so I stood off, and held
my tongue, in great perplexity.

<p/>A movement of Catherine's relieved me a little presently: she (<font color='blue'><b>Catherine</b></font>) put up her (<font color='blue'><b>Catherine</b></font>)
hand to clasp his (<font color='blue'><b>Nelly</b></font>) neck, and bring her (<font color='blue'><b>Catherine</b></font>) cheek to his (<font color='blue'><b>Nelly</b></font>) as he (<font color='blue'><b>Nelly</b></font>) held her (<font color='blue'><b>Catherine</b></font>); while
he (<font color='blue'><b>Nelly</b></font>), in return, covering her (<font color='blue'><b>Catherine</b></font>) with frantic caresses, said wildly--

<p/><div class="bookquote">``You teach me now how cruel you've been--cruel and false. _Why_ did you
despise me? _Why_ did you betray your own heart, Cathy? I have not one
word of comfort. You deserve this. You have killed yourself. Yes, you
may kiss me, and cry; and wring out my kisses and tears: they'll blight
you--they'll damn you. You loved me--then what _right_ had you to leave
me? What right--answer me--for the poor fancy you felt for Linton?
Because misery and degradation, and death, and nothing that God or Satan
could inflict would have parted us, _you_, of your own will, did it. I
have not broken your heart--_you_ have broken it; and in breaking it, you
have broken mine. So much the worse for me that I am strong. Do I want
to live? What kind of living will it be when you--oh, God! would _you_
like to live with your soul in the grave?''

 (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Let me alone. Let me alone,''  (<font color='red'><b>Catherine/Earnshaw/Catherine Earnshaw</b></font>)</div>sobbed Catherine. <div class="bookquote">``If I've done wrong,
I'm dying for it. It is enough! You left me too: but I won't upbraid
you! I forgive you. Forgive me!''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``It is hard to forgive, and to look at those eyes, and feel those wasted
hands,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Nelly</b></font>) answered. <div class="bookquote">``Kiss me again; and don't let me see your eyes! I
forgive what you have done to me. I love _my_ murderer--but _yours_! How
can I?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/>They were silent--their faces hid against each other, and washed by each
other's tears. At least, I suppose the weeping was on both sides; as it
seemed Heathcliff could weep on a great occasion like this.

<p/>I grew very uncomfortable, meanwhile; for the afternoon wore fast away,
the man whom I had sent off returned from his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) errand, and I could
distinguish, by the shine of the western sun up the valley, a concourse
thickening outside Gimmerton chapel porch.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Service is over,''  (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div>I announced. <div class="bookquote">``My master will be here in half an
hour.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Heathcliff/Mr. Heathcliff</b></font>)</div><p/>Heathcliff groaned a curse, and strained Catherine closer: she (<font color='blue'><b>Catherine</b></font>) never
moved.

<p/>Ere long I perceived a group of the servants passing up the road towards
the kitchen wing. Mr. Linton was not far behind; he (<font color='blue'><b>Linton</b></font>) opened the gate
himself and sauntered slowly up, probably enjoying the lovely afternoon
that breathed as soft as summer.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Now he (<font color='blue'><b>master</b></font>) is here,''  (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div>I exclaimed. <div class="bookquote">``For heaven's sake, hurry down! You'll
not meet any one on the front stairs. Do be quick; and stay among the
trees till he (<font color='blue'><b>master</b></font>) is fairly in.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I must go, Cathy,''  (<font color='red'><b>Heathcliff/Mr. Heathcliff</b></font>)</div>said Heathcliff, seeking to extricate himself from
his (<font color='blue'><b>Heathcliff</b></font>) companion's arms. <div class="bookquote">``But if I live, I'll see you again before you are
asleep. I won't stray five yards from your window.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``You must not go!''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Catherine</b></font>) answered, holding him (<font color='blue'><b>Heathcliff</b></font>) as firmly as her (<font color='blue'><b>Catherine</b></font>) strength
allowed. <div class="bookquote">``You _shall_ not, I tell you.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``For one hour,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Heathcliff</b></font>) pleaded earnestly.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Not for one minute,''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Catherine</b></font>) replied.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``I _must_--Linton will be up immediately,''  (<font color='red'><b>the intruder</b></font>)</div>persisted the alarmed
intruder.

<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Heathcliff</b></font>) would have risen, and unfixed her (<font color='blue'><b>Catherine</b></font>) fingers by the act--she (<font color='blue'><b>Catherine</b></font>) clung fast,
gasping: there was mad resolution in her (<font color='blue'><b>Catherine</b></font>) face.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``No!''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Catherine</b></font>) shrieked. <div class="bookquote">``Oh, don't, don't go. It is the last time! Edgar
will not hurt us. Heathcliff, I shall die! I shall die!''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Damn the fool! There he (<font color='blue'><b>Heathcliff</b></font>) is,''  (<font color='red'><b>Heathcliff/Mr. Heathcliff</b></font>)</div>cried Heathcliff, sinking back into his (<font color='blue'><b>Heathcliff</b></font>)
seat. <div class="bookquote">``Hush, my darling! Hush, hush, Catherine! I'll stay. If he (<font color='blue'><b>Heathcliff</b></font>) shot
me so, I'd expire with a blessing on my lips.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/>And there they were fast again. I heard my master mounting the
stairs--the cold sweat ran from my forehead: I was horrified.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Are you going to listen to her (<font color='blue'><b>Catherine</b></font>) ravings?''  (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div>I said, passionately. <div class="bookquote">``She (<font color='blue'><b>Catherine</b></font>)
does not know what she (<font color='blue'><b>Catherine</b></font>) says. Will you ruin her (<font color='blue'><b>Catherine</b></font>), because she (<font color='blue'><b>Catherine</b></font>) has not wit
to help herself? Get up! You could be free instantly. That is the most
diabolical deed that ever you did. We are all done for--master,
mistress, and servant.''

 (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div><p/>I wrung my hands, and cried out; and Mr. Linton hastened his (<font color='blue'><b>Linton</b></font>) step at the
noise. In the midst of my agitation, I was sincerely glad to observe
that Catherine's arms had fallen relaxed, and her (<font color='blue'><b>Catherine</b></font>) head hung down.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``She (<font color='blue'><b>mistress</b></font>)'s fainted, or dead,''  (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div>I thought: `so much the better. Far better
that she (<font color='blue'><b>Catherine</b></font>) should be dead, than lingering a burden and a misery-maker to
all about her (<font color='blue'><b>Catherine</b></font>).''

<p/>Edgar sprang to his (<font color='blue'><b>Edgar</b></font>) unbidden guest, blanched with astonishment and rage.
What he (<font color='blue'><b>Edgar</b></font>) meant to do I cannot tell; however, the other stopped all
demonstrations, at once, by placing the lifeless-looking form in his (<font color='blue'><b>Edgar</b></font>)
arms.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Look there!''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Edgar</b></font>) said. <div class="bookquote">``Unless you be a fiend, help her (<font color='blue'><b>mistress</b></font>) first--then you
shall speak to me!''

 (<font color='red'><b>He</b></font>)</div><p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Edgar</b></font>) walked into the parlour, and sat down. Mr. Linton summoned me, and
with great difficulty, and after resorting to many means, we managed to
restore her (<font color='blue'><b>Catherine</b></font>) to sensation; but she (<font color='blue'><b>Catherine</b></font>) was all bewildered; she (<font color='blue'><b>Catherine</b></font>) sighed, and
moaned, and knew nobody. Edgar, in his (<font color='blue'><b>Edgar</b></font>) anxiety for her (<font color='blue'><b>Catherine</b></font>), forgot her (<font color='blue'><b>Catherine</b></font>) hated
friend. I did not. I went, at the earliest opportunity, and besought
him (<font color='blue'><b>Edgar</b></font>) to depart; affirming that Catherine was better, and he (<font color='blue'><b>Edgar</b></font>) should hear
from me in the morning how she (<font color='blue'><b>Catherine</b></font>) passed the night.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``I shall not refuse to go out of doors,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Edgar</b></font>) answered; `but I shall stay
in the garden: and, Nelly, mind you keep your word to-morrow. I shall be
under those larch-trees. Mind! or I pay another visit, whether Linton be
in or not.''

<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Nelly</b></font>) sent a rapid glance through the half-open door of the chamber, and,
ascertaining that what I stated was apparently true, delivered the house
of his (<font color='blue'><b>Nelly</b></font>) luckless presence.




<p/>CHAPTER XVI


<p/>About twelve o'clock that night was born the Catherine you saw at
Wuthering Heights: a puny, seven-months' child; and two hours after the
mother died, having never recovered sufficient consciousness to miss
Heathcliff, or know Edgar. The latter's distraction at his (<font color='blue'><b>Edgar</b></font>) bereavement
is a subject too painful to be dwelt on; its after-effects showed how
deep the sorrow sunk. A great addition, in my eyes, was his (<font color='blue'><b>Edgar</b></font>) being left
without an heir. I bemoaned that, as I gazed on the feeble orphan; and I
mentally abused old Linton for -LRB-what was only natural partiality-RRB- the
securing his (<font color='blue'><b>Edgar</b></font>) estate to his (<font color='blue'><b>Edgar</b></font>) own daughter, instead of his (<font color='blue'><b>Edgar</b></font>) son's. An
unwelcomed infant it was, poor thing! It might have wailed out of life,
and nobody cared a morsel, during those first hours of existence. We
redeemed the neglect afterwards; but its beginning was as friendless as
its end is likely to be.

<p/>Next morning--bright and cheerful out of doors--stole softened in through
the blinds of the silent room, and suffused the couch and its occupant
with a mellow, tender glow. Edgar Linton had his (<font color='blue'><b>Linton</b></font>) head laid on the
pillow, and his (<font color='blue'><b>Linton</b></font>) eyes shut. His (<font color='blue'><b>Linton</b></font>) young and fair features were almost as
deathlike as those of the form beside him (<font color='blue'><b>Linton</b></font>), and almost as fixed: but _his (<font color='blue'><b>Linton</b></font>)_
was the hush of exhausted anguish, and _hers_ of perfect peace. Her (<font color='blue'><b>Linton</b></font>) brow
smooth, her (<font color='blue'><b>Linton</b></font>) lids closed, her (<font color='blue'><b>Linton</b></font>) lips wearing the expression of a smile; no
angel in heaven could be more beautiful than she (<font color='blue'><b>Linton</b></font>) appeared. And I partook
of the infinite calm in which she (<font color='blue'><b>Linton</b></font>) lay: my mind was never in a holier
frame than while I gazed on that untroubled image of Divine rest. I
instinctively echoed the words she (<font color='blue'><b>Linton</b></font>) had uttered a few hours before:
<div class="bookquote">``Incomparably beyond and above us all! Whether still on earth or now in
heaven, her (<font color='blue'><b>mistress</b></font>) spirit is at home with God!''

 (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div><p/>I don't know if it be a peculiarity in me, but I am seldom otherwise than
happy while watching in the chamber of death, should no frenzied or
despairing mourner share the duty with me. I see a repose that neither
earth nor hell can break, and I feel an assurance of the endless and
shadowless hereafter--the Eternity they have entered--where life is
boundless in its duration, and love in its sympathy, and joy in its
fulness. I noticed on that occasion how much selfishness there is even
in a love like Mr. Linton's, when he (<font color='blue'><b>Linton</b></font>) so regretted Catherine's blessed
release! To be sure, one might have doubted, after the wayward and
impatient existence she (<font color='blue'><b>Catherine</b></font>) had led, whether she (<font color='blue'><b>Catherine</b></font>) merited a haven of peace at
last. One might doubt in seasons of cold reflection; but not then, in
the presence of her (<font color='blue'><b>Catherine</b></font>) corpse. It asserted its own tranquillity, which
seemed a pledge of equal quiet to its former inhabitant.

<p/>Do you believe such people are happy in the other world, sir? I'd give a
great deal to know.

<p/>I declined answering Mrs. Dean's question, which struck me as something
heterodox. She (<font color='blue'><b>Dean</b></font>) proceeded:

<p/>Retracing the course of Catherine Linton, I fear we have no right to
think she (<font color='blue'><b>Dean</b></font>) is; but we'll leave her (<font color='blue'><b>Dean</b></font>) with her (<font color='blue'><b>Dean</b></font>) Maker.

<p/>The master looked asleep, and I ventured soon after sunrise to quit the
room and steal out to the pure refreshing air. The servants thought me
gone to shake off the drowsiness of my protracted watch; in reality, my
chief motive was seeing Mr. Heathcliff. If he (<font color='blue'><b>Heathcliff</b></font>) had remained among the
larches all night, he (<font color='blue'><b>Heathcliff</b></font>) would have heard nothing of the stir at the Grange;
unless, perhaps, he (<font color='blue'><b>Heathcliff</b></font>) might catch the gallop of the messenger going to
Gimmerton. If he (<font color='blue'><b>Heathcliff</b></font>) had come nearer, he (<font color='blue'><b>Heathcliff</b></font>) would probably be aware, from the
lights flitting to and fro, and the opening and shutting of the outer
doors, that all was not right within. I wished, yet feared, to find him (<font color='blue'><b>Heathcliff</b></font>).
I felt the terrible news must be told, and I longed to get it over; but
how to do it I did not know. He (<font color='blue'><b>Heathcliff</b></font>) was there--at least, a few yards further
in the park; leant against an old ash-tree, his (<font color='blue'><b>Heathcliff</b></font>) hat off, and his (<font color='blue'><b>Heathcliff</b></font>) hair
soaked with the dew that had gathered on the budded branches, and fell
pattering round him (<font color='blue'><b>Heathcliff</b></font>). He (<font color='blue'><b>Heathcliff</b></font>) had been standing a long time in that position,
for I saw a pair of ousels passing and repassing scarcely three feet from
him (<font color='blue'><b>Heathcliff</b></font>), busy in building their nest, and regarding his (<font color='blue'><b>Heathcliff</b></font>) proximity no more
than that of a piece of timber. They flew off at my approach, and he (<font color='blue'><b>Heathcliff</b></font>)
raised his (<font color='blue'><b>Heathcliff</b></font>) eyes and spoke:--<div class="bookquote">``She (<font color='blue'><b>mistress</b></font>)'s dead!''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Heathcliff</b></font>) said; <div class="bookquote">``I've not waited for
you to learn that. Put your handkerchief away--don't snivel before me.
Damn you all! she (<font color='blue'><b>mistress</b></font>) wants none of your tears!''

 (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div><p/>I was weeping as much for him (<font color='blue'><b>Heathcliff</b></font>) as her (<font color='blue'><b>Heathcliff</b></font>): we do sometimes pity creatures that
have none of the feeling either for themselves or others. When I first
looked into his (<font color='blue'><b>Heathcliff</b></font>) face, I perceived that he (<font color='blue'><b>Heathcliff</b></font>) had got intelligence of the
catastrophe; and a foolish notion struck me that his (<font color='blue'><b>Heathcliff</b></font>) heart was quelled
and he (<font color='blue'><b>Heathcliff</b></font>) prayed, because his (<font color='blue'><b>Heathcliff</b></font>) lips moved and his (<font color='blue'><b>Heathcliff</b></font>) gaze was bent on the
ground.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Yes, she (<font color='blue'><b>mistress</b></font>)'s dead!''  (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div>I answered, checking my sobs and drying my cheeks.
<div class="bookquote">``Gone to heaven, I hope; where we may, every one, join her (<font color='blue'><b>mistress</b></font>), if we take
due warning and leave our evil ways to follow good!''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Did _she (<font color='blue'><b>mistress</b></font>)_ take due warning, then?''  (<font color='red'><b>Heathcliff/Mr. Heathcliff</b></font>)</div>asked Heathcliff, attempting a sneer.
<div class="bookquote">``Did she (<font color='blue'><b>mistress</b></font>) die like a saint? Come, give me a true history of the event.
How did--?''

 (<font color='red'><b>He</b></font>)</div><p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Heathcliff</b></font>) endeavoured to pronounce the name, but could not manage it; and
compressing his (<font color='blue'><b>Heathcliff</b></font>) mouth he (<font color='blue'><b>Heathcliff</b></font>) held a silent combat with his (<font color='blue'><b>Heathcliff</b></font>) inward agony,
defying, meanwhile, my sympathy with an unflinching, ferocious stare.
<div class="bookquote">``How did she (<font color='blue'><b>mistress</b></font>) die?''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Heathcliff</b></font>) resumed, at last--fain, notwithstanding his (<font color='blue'><b>Heathcliff</b></font>)
hardihood, to have a support behind him (<font color='blue'><b>Heathcliff</b></font>); for, after the struggle, he (<font color='blue'><b>Heathcliff</b></font>)
trembled, in spite of himself, to his (<font color='blue'><b>Heathcliff</b></font>) very finger-ends.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Poor wretch!''  (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div>I thought; `you have a heart and nerves the same as your
brother men! Why should you be anxious to conceal them? Your pride
cannot blind God! You tempt him (<font color='blue'><b>God</b></font>) to wring them, till he (<font color='blue'><b>God</b></font>) forces a cry of
humiliation.''

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Quietly as a lamb!''  (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div>I answered, aloud. <div class="bookquote">``She (<font color='blue'><b>mistress</b></font>) drew a sigh, and stretched
herself, like a child reviving, and sinking again to sleep; and five
minutes after I felt one little pulse at her (<font color='blue'><b>mistress</b></font>) heart, and nothing more!''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``And--did she (<font color='blue'><b>mistress</b></font>) ever mention me?''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>God</b></font>) asked, hesitating, as if he (<font color='blue'><b>God</b></font>) dreaded
the answer to his (<font color='blue'><b>God</b></font>) question would introduce details that he (<font color='blue'><b>God</b></font>) could not bear
to hear.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Her (<font color='blue'><b>mistress</b></font>) senses never returned: she (<font color='blue'><b>mistress</b></font>) recognised nobody from the time you left
her (<font color='blue'><b>mistress</b></font>),''  (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div>I said. <div class="bookquote">``She (<font color='blue'><b>mistress</b></font>) lies with a sweet smile on her (<font color='blue'><b>mistress</b></font>) face; and her (<font color='blue'><b>mistress</b></font>) latest
ideas wandered back to pleasant early days. Her (<font color='blue'><b>mistress</b></font>) life closed in a gentle
dream--may she (<font color='blue'><b>mistress</b></font>) wake as kindly in the other world!''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``May she (<font color='blue'><b>mistress</b></font>) wake in torment!''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>God</b></font>) cried, with frightful vehemence, stamping
his (<font color='blue'><b>God</b></font>) foot, and groaning in a sudden paroxysm of ungovernable passion.
<div class="bookquote">``Why, she (<font color='blue'><b>mistress</b></font>)'s a liar to the end! Where is she (<font color='blue'><b>mistress</b></font>)? Not _there_--not in
heaven--not perished--where? Oh! you said you cared nothing for my
sufferings! And I pray one prayer--I repeat it till my tongue
stiffens--Catherine Earnshaw, may you not rest as long as I am living;
you said I killed you--haunt me, then! The murdered _do_ haunt their
murderers, I believe. I know that ghosts _have_ wandered on earth. Be
with me always--take any form--drive me mad! only _do_ not leave me in
this abyss, where I cannot find you! Oh, God! it is unutterable! I
_cannot_ live without my life! I _cannot_ live without my soul!''

 (<font color='red'><b>He</b></font>)</div><p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>God</b></font>) dashed his (<font color='blue'><b>God</b></font>) head against the knotted trunk; and, lifting up his (<font color='blue'><b>God</b></font>) eyes,
howled, not like a man, but like a savage beast being goaded to death
with knives and spears. I observed several splashes of blood about the
bark of the tree, and his (<font color='blue'><b>God</b></font>) hand and forehead were both stained; probably
the scene I witnessed was a repetition of others acted during the night.
It hardly moved my compassion--it appalled me: still, I felt reluctant to
quit him (<font color='blue'><b>God</b></font>) so. But the moment he (<font color='blue'><b>God</b></font>) recollected himself enough to notice me
watching, he (<font color='blue'><b>God</b></font>) thundered a command for me to go, and I obeyed. He (<font color='blue'><b>God</b></font>) was
beyond my skill to quiet or console!

<p/>Mrs. Linton's funeral was appointed to take place on the Friday following
her (<font color='blue'><b>Linton</b></font>) decease; and till then her (<font color='blue'><b>Linton</b></font>) coffin remained uncovered, and strewn with
flowers and scented leaves, in the great drawing-room. Linton spent his (<font color='blue'><b>God</b></font>)
days and nights there, a sleepless guardian; and--a circumstance
concealed from all but me--Heathcliff spent his (<font color='blue'><b>Heathcliff</b></font>) nights, at least,
outside, equally a stranger to repose. I held no communication with him (<font color='blue'><b>Heathcliff</b></font>):
still, I was conscious of his (<font color='blue'><b>Heathcliff</b></font>) design to enter, if he (<font color='blue'><b>Heathcliff</b></font>) could; and on the
Tuesday, a little after dark, when my master, from sheer fatigue, had
been compelled to retire a couple of hours, I went and opened one of the
windows; moved by his (<font color='blue'><b>master</b></font>) perseverance to give him (<font color='blue'><b>master</b></font>) a chance of bestowing on
the faded image of his (<font color='blue'><b>master</b></font>) idol one final adieu. He (<font color='blue'><b>master</b></font>) did not omit to avail
himself of the opportunity, cautiously and briefly; too cautiously to
betray his (<font color='blue'><b>master</b></font>) presence by the slightest noise. Indeed, I shouldn't have
discovered that he (<font color='blue'><b>master</b></font>) had been there, except for the disarrangement of the
drapery about the corpse's face, and for observing on the floor a curl of
light hair, fastened with a silver thread; which, on examination, I
ascertained to have been taken from a locket hung round Catherine's neck.
Heathcliff had opened the trinket and cast out its contents, replacing
them by a black lock of his (<font color='blue'><b>Heathcliff</b></font>) own. I twisted the two, and enclosed them
together.

<p/>Mr. Earnshaw was, of course, invited to attend the remains of his (<font color='blue'><b>Earnshaw</b></font>) sister
to the grave; he (<font color='blue'><b>Earnshaw</b></font>) sent no excuse, but he (<font color='blue'><b>Earnshaw</b></font>) never came; so that, besides her (<font color='blue'><b>sister</b></font>)
husband, the mourners were wholly composed of tenants and servants.
Isabella was not asked.

<p/>The place of Catherine's interment, to the surprise of the villagers, was
neither in the chapel under the carved monument of the Lintons, nor yet
by the tombs of her (<font color='blue'><b>Catherine</b></font>) own relations, outside. It was dug on a green slope
in a corner of the kirk-yard, where the wall is so low that heath and
bilberry-plants have climbed over it from the moor; and peat-mould almost
buries it. Her (<font color='blue'><b>Catherine</b></font>) husband lies in the same spot now; and they have each a
simple headstone above, and a plain grey block at their feet, to mark the
graves.




<p/>CHAPTER XVII


<p/>That Friday made the last of our fine days for a month. In the evening
the weather broke: the wind shifted from south to north-east, and brought
rain first, and then sleet and snow. On the morrow one could hardly
imagine that there had been three weeks of summer: the primroses and
crocuses were hidden under wintry drifts; the larks were silent, the
young leaves of the early trees smitten and blackened. And dreary, and
chill, and dismal, that morrow did creep over! My master kept his (<font color='blue'><b>master</b></font>) room;
I took possession of the lonely parlour, converting it into a nursery:
and there I was, sitting with the moaning doll of a child laid on my
knee; rocking it to and fro, and watching, meanwhile, the still driving
flakes build up the uncurtained window, when the door opened, and some
person entered, out of breath and laughing! My anger was greater than my
astonishment for a minute. I supposed it one of the maids, and I
cried--<div class="bookquote">``Have done! How dare you show your giddiness here; What would Mr.
Linton say if he (<font color='blue'><b>Linton</b></font>) heard you?''

 (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Excuse me!''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>answered a familiar voice; `but I know Edgar is in bed, and
I cannot stop myself.''

<p/>With that the speaker came forward to the fire, panting and holding her (<font color='blue'><b>child</b></font>)
hand to her (<font color='blue'><b>child</b></font>) side.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``I have run the whole way from Wuthering Heights!''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>child</b></font>) continued, after a
pause; `except where I've flown. I couldn't count the number of falls
I've had. Oh, I'm aching all over! Don't be alarmed! There shall be an
explanation as soon as I can give it; only just have the goodness to step
out and order the carriage to take me on to Gimmerton, and tell a servant
to seek up a few clothes in my wardrobe.''

<p/>The intruder was Mrs. Heathcliff. She (<font color='blue'><b>Heathcliff</b></font>) certainly seemed in no laughing
predicament: her (<font color='blue'><b>Heathcliff</b></font>) hair streamed on her (<font color='blue'><b>Heathcliff</b></font>) shoulders, dripping with snow and
water; she (<font color='blue'><b>Heathcliff</b></font>) was dressed in the girlish dress she (<font color='blue'><b>Heathcliff</b></font>) commonly wore, befitting
her (<font color='blue'><b>Heathcliff</b></font>) age more than her (<font color='blue'><b>Heathcliff</b></font>) position: a low frock with short sleeves, and
nothing on either head or neck. The frock was of light silk, and clung
to her (<font color='blue'><b>Heathcliff</b></font>) with wet, and her (<font color='blue'><b>Heathcliff</b></font>) feet were protected merely by thin slippers; add
to this a deep cut under one ear, which only the cold prevented from
bleeding profusely, a white face scratched and bruised, and a frame
hardly able to support itself through fatigue; and you may fancy my first
fright was not much allayed when I had had leisure to examine her (<font color='blue'><b>Heathcliff</b></font>).

<p/><div class="bookquote">``My dear young lady,''  (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div>I exclaimed, <div class="bookquote">``I'll stir nowhere, and hear nothing,
till you have removed every article of your clothes, and put on dry
things; and certainly you shall not go to Gimmerton to-night, so it is
needless to order the carriage.''

 (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Certainly I shall,''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Heathcliff</b></font>) said; `walking or riding: yet I've no objection
to dress myself decently. And--ah, see how it flows down my neck now!
The fire does make it smart.''

<p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>Heathcliff</b></font>) insisted on my fulfilling her (<font color='blue'><b>Heathcliff</b></font>) directions, before she (<font color='blue'><b>Heathcliff</b></font>) would let me
touch her (<font color='blue'><b>Heathcliff</b></font>); and not till after the coachman had been instructed to get
ready, and a maid set to pack up some necessary attire, did I obtain her (<font color='blue'><b>maid</b></font>)
consent for binding the wound and helping to change her (<font color='blue'><b>maid</b></font>) garments.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Now, Ellen,''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>maid</b></font>) said, when my task was finished and she (<font color='blue'><b>maid</b></font>) was seated in
an easy-chair on the hearth, with a cup of tea before her (<font color='blue'><b>maid</b></font>), `you sit down
opposite me, and put poor Catherine's baby away: I don't like to see it!
You mustn't think I care little for Catherine, because I behaved so
foolishly on entering: I've cried, too, bitterly--yes, more than any one
else has reason to cry. We parted unreconciled, you remember, and I
sha'n't forgive myself. But, for all that, I was not going to sympathise
with him (<font color='blue'><b>I</b></font>)--the brute beast! Oh, give me the poker! This is the last
thing of his (<font color='blue'><b>I</b></font>) I have about me:' she (<font color='blue'><b>Catherine</b></font>) slipped the gold ring from her (<font color='blue'><b>Catherine</b></font>) third
finger, and threw it on the floor. <div class="bookquote">``I'll smash it!''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Catherine</b></font>) continued,
striking it with childish spite, `and then I'll burn it!'' and she (<font color='blue'><b>Catherine</b></font>) took
and dropped the misused article among the coals. <div class="bookquote">``There! he (<font color='blue'><b>Linton</b></font>) shall buy
another, if he (<font color='blue'><b>Linton</b></font>) gets me back again. He (<font color='blue'><b>Linton</b></font>)'d be capable of coming to seek me,
to tease Edgar. I dare not stay, lest that notion should possess his (<font color='blue'><b>Edgar</b></font>)
wicked head! And besides, Edgar has not been kind, has he (<font color='blue'><b>Edgar</b></font>)? And I won't
come suing for his (<font color='blue'><b>Edgar</b></font>) assistance; nor will I bring him (<font color='blue'><b>Edgar</b></font>) into more trouble.
Necessity compelled me to seek shelter here; though, if I had not learned
he (<font color='blue'><b>Edgar</b></font>) was out of the way, I'd have halted at the kitchen, washed my face,
warmed myself, got you to bring what I wanted, and departed again to
anywhere out of the reach of my accursed--of that incarnate goblin! Ah,
he (<font color='blue'><b>Edgar</b></font>) was in such a fury! If he (<font color='blue'><b>Edgar</b></font>) had caught me! It's a pity Earnshaw is not
his (<font color='blue'><b>Edgar</b></font>) match in strength: I wouldn't have run till I'd seen him (<font color='blue'><b>Edgar</b></font>) all but
demolished, had Hindley been able to do it!''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Well, don't talk so fast, Miss!''  (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div>I interrupted; `you'll disorder the
handkerchief I have tied round your face, and make the cut bleed again.
Drink your tea, and take breath, and give over laughing: laughter is
sadly out of place under this roof, and in your condition!''

<p/><div class="bookquote">``An undeniable truth,''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Catherine</b></font>) replied. <div class="bookquote">``Listen to that child! It maintains
a constant wail--send it out of my hearing for an hour; I sha'n't stay
any longer.''

 (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div><p/>I rang the bell, and committed it to a servant's care; and then I
inquired what had urged her (<font color='blue'><b>Catherine</b></font>) to escape from Wuthering Heights in such an
unlikely plight, and where she (<font color='blue'><b>Catherine</b></font>) meant to go, as she (<font color='blue'><b>Catherine</b></font>) refused remaining with
us.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``I ought, and I wished to remain,''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>answered she (<font color='blue'><b>Catherine</b></font>), `to cheer Edgar and take
care of the baby, for two things, and because the Grange is my right
home. But I tell you he (<font color='blue'><b>Edgar</b></font>) wouldn't let me! Do you think he (<font color='blue'><b>Edgar</b></font>) could bear to
see me grow fat and merry--could bear to think that we were tranquil, and
not resolve on poisoning our comfort? Now, I have the satisfaction of
being sure that he (<font color='blue'><b>Edgar</b></font>) detests me, to the point of its annoying him (<font color='blue'><b>Edgar</b></font>) seriously
to have me within ear-shot or eyesight: I notice, when I enter his (<font color='blue'><b>Edgar</b></font>)
presence, the muscles of his (<font color='blue'><b>Edgar</b></font>) countenance are involuntarily distorted into
an expression of hatred; partly arising from his (<font color='blue'><b>Edgar</b></font>) knowledge of the good
causes I have to feel that sentiment for him (<font color='blue'><b>Edgar</b></font>), and partly from original
aversion. It is strong enough to make me feel pretty certain that he (<font color='blue'><b>Edgar</b></font>)
would not chase me over England, supposing I contrived a clear escape;
and therefore I must get quite away. I've recovered from my first desire
to be killed by him (<font color='blue'><b>Edgar</b></font>): I'd rather he (<font color='blue'><b>Edgar</b></font>)'d kill himself! He (<font color='blue'><b>Edgar</b></font>) has extinguished
my love effectually, and so I'm at my ease. I can recollect yet how I
loved him (<font color='blue'><b>Edgar</b></font>); and can dimly imagine that I could still be loving him (<font color='blue'><b>Edgar</b></font>), if--no,
no! Even if he (<font color='blue'><b>Edgar</b></font>) had doted on me, the devilish nature would have revealed
its existence somehow. Catherine had an awfully perverted taste to
esteem him (<font color='blue'><b>Edgar</b></font>) so dearly, knowing him (<font color='blue'><b>Edgar</b></font>) so well. Monster! would that he (<font color='blue'><b>Edgar</b></font>) could
be blotted out of creation, and out of my memory!''

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Hush, hush! He (<font color='blue'><b>Hindley</b></font>)'s a human being,''  (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div>I said. <div class="bookquote">``Be more charitable: there
are worse men than he (<font color='blue'><b>Hindley</b></font>) is yet!''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``He (<font color='blue'><b>Hindley</b></font>)'s not a human being,''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Catherine</b></font>) retorted; `and he (<font color='blue'><b>Edgar</b></font>) has no claim on my
charity. I gave him (<font color='blue'><b>Edgar</b></font>) my heart, and he (<font color='blue'><b>Edgar</b></font>) took and pinched it to death, and
flung it back to me. People feel with their hearts, Ellen: and since he (<font color='blue'><b>Edgar</b></font>)
has destroyed mine, I have not power to feel for him (<font color='blue'><b>Edgar</b></font>): and I would not,
though he (<font color='blue'><b>Edgar</b></font>) groaned from this to his (<font color='blue'><b>Edgar</b></font>) dying day, and wept tears of blood for
Catherine! No, indeed, indeed, I wouldn<div class="bookquote">``t!''  (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div>And here Isabella began to
cry; but, immediately dashing the water from her (<font color='blue'><b>Isabella</b></font>) lashes, she (<font color='blue'><b>Isabella</b></font>) recommenced.
``You asked, what has driven me to flight at last? I was compelled to
attempt it, because I had succeeded in rousing his (<font color='blue'><b>Hindley</b></font>) rage a pitch above his (<font color='blue'><b>Hindley</b></font>)
malignity. Pulling out the nerves with red hot pincers requires more
coolness than knocking on the head. He (<font color='blue'><b>Hindley</b></font>) was worked up to forget the
fiendish prudence he (<font color='blue'><b>Hindley</b></font>) boasted of, and proceeded to murderous violence. I
experienced pleasure in being able to exasperate him (<font color='blue'><b>Hindley</b></font>): the sense of
pleasure woke my instinct of self-preservation, so I fairly broke free;
and if ever I come into his (<font color='blue'><b>Hindley</b></font>) hands again he (<font color='blue'><b>Hindley</b></font>) is welcome to a signal
revenge.

<p/>``Yesterday, you know, Mr. Earnshaw should have been at the funeral. He (<font color='blue'><b>Earnshaw</b></font>)
kept himself sober for the purpose--tolerably sober: not going to bed mad
at six o'clock and getting up drunk at twelve. Consequently, he (<font color='blue'><b>Earnshaw</b></font>) rose, in
suicidal low spirits, as fit for the church as for a dance; and instead,
he (<font color='blue'><b>Earnshaw</b></font>) sat down by the fire and swallowed gin or brandy by tumblerfuls.

<p/>``Heathcliff--I shudder to name him (<font color='blue'><b>Earnshaw</b></font>)! has been a stranger in the house from
last Sunday till to-day. Whether the angels have fed him (<font color='blue'><b>stranger</b></font>), or his (<font color='blue'><b>stranger</b></font>) kin
beneath, I cannot tell; but he (<font color='blue'><b>stranger</b></font>) has not eaten a meal with us for nearly a
week. He (<font color='blue'><b>stranger</b></font>) has just come home at dawn, and gone up-stairs to his (<font color='blue'><b>stranger</b></font>) chamber;
locking himself in--as if anybody dreamt of coveting his (<font color='blue'><b>stranger</b></font>) company! There
he (<font color='blue'><b>stranger</b></font>) has continued, praying like a Methodist: only the deity he (<font color='blue'><b>deity</b></font>) implored is
senseless dust and ashes; and God, when addressed, was curiously
confounded with his (<font color='blue'><b>God</b></font>) own black father! After concluding these precious
orisons--and they lasted generally till he (<font color='blue'><b>God</b></font>) grew hoarse and his (<font color='blue'><b>God</b></font>) voice was
strangled in his (<font color='blue'><b>God</b></font>) throat--he (<font color='blue'><b>God</b></font>) would be off again; always straight down to
the Grange! I wonder Edgar did not send for a constable, and give him (<font color='blue'><b>Edgar</b></font>)
into custody! For me, grieved as I was about Catherine, it was
impossible to avoid regarding this season of deliverance from degrading
oppression as a holiday.

<p/>``I recovered spirits sufficient to bear Joseph's eternal lectures without
weeping, and to move up and down the house less with the foot of a
frightened thief than formerly. You wouldn't think that I should cry at
anything Joseph could say; but he (<font color='blue'><b>Joseph</b></font>) and Hareton are detestable companions.
I'd rather sit with Hindley, and hear his (<font color='blue'><b>Hindley</b></font>) awful talk, than with ``t'
little maister'' and his (<font color='blue'><b>Edgar</b></font>) staunch supporter, that odious old man! When
Heathcliff is in, I'm often obliged to seek the kitchen and their
society, or starve among the damp uninhabited chambers; when he (<font color='blue'><b>Heathcliff</b></font>) is not,
as was the case this week, I establish a table and chair at one corner of
the house fire, and never mind how Mr. Earnshaw may occupy himself; and
he (<font color='blue'><b>Earnshaw</b></font>) does not interfere with my arrangements. He (<font color='blue'><b>Earnshaw</b></font>) is quieter now than he (<font color='blue'><b>Earnshaw</b></font>)
used to be, if no one provokes him (<font color='blue'><b>Earnshaw</b></font>): more sullen and depressed, and less
furious. Joseph affirms he (<font color='blue'><b>Joseph</b></font>)'s sure he (<font color='blue'><b>Joseph</b></font>)'s an altered man: that the Lord has
touched his (<font color='blue'><b>Lord</b></font>) heart, and he (<font color='blue'><b>Lord</b></font>) is saved <div class="bookquote">``so as by fire.''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>I'm puzzled to
detect signs of the favourable change: but it is not my business.

<p/>``Yester-evening I sat in my nook reading some old books till late on
towards twelve. It seemed so dismal to go up-stairs, with the wild snow
blowing outside, and my thoughts continually reverting to the kirk-yard
and the new-made grave! I dared hardly lift my eyes from the page before
me, that melancholy scene so instantly usurped its place. Hindley sat
opposite, his (<font color='blue'><b>Hindley</b></font>) head leant on his (<font color='blue'><b>Hindley</b></font>) hand; perhaps meditating on the same
subject. He (<font color='blue'><b>Hindley</b></font>) had ceased drinking at a point below irrationality, and had
neither stirred nor spoken during two or three hours. There was no sound
through the house but the moaning wind, which shook the windows every now
and then, the faint crackling of the coals, and the click of my snuffers
as I removed at intervals the long wick of the candle. Hareton and
Joseph were probably fast asleep in bed. It was very, very sad: and
while I read I sighed, for it seemed as if all joy had vanished from the
world, never to be restored.

<p/>``The doleful silence was broken at length by the sound of the kitchen
latch: Heathcliff had returned from his (<font color='blue'><b>Heathcliff</b></font>) watch earlier than usual; owing,
I suppose, to the sudden storm. That entrance was fastened, and we heard
him (<font color='blue'><b>Heathcliff</b></font>) coming round to get in by the other. I rose with an irrepressible
expression of what I felt on my lips, which induced my companion, who had
been staring towards the door, to turn and look at me.

<p/>'<div class="bookquote">``I'll keep him (<font color='blue'><b>companion</b></font>) out five minutes,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Lord</b></font>) exclaimed. <div class="bookquote">``You won't object?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/>'<div class="bookquote">``No, you may keep him (<font color='blue'><b>companion</b></font>) out the whole night for me,''  (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div>I answered. <div class="bookquote">``Do! put
the key in the lock, and draw the bolts.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/>``Earnshaw accomplished this ere his (<font color='blue'><b>companion</b></font>) guest reached the front; he (<font color='blue'><b>companion</b></font>) then came
and brought his (<font color='blue'><b>companion</b></font>) chair to the other side of my table, leaning over it, and
searching in my eyes for a sympathy with the burning hate that gleamed
from his (<font color='blue'><b>companion</b></font>): as he (<font color='blue'><b>companion</b></font>) both looked and felt like an assassin, he (<font color='blue'><b>companion</b></font>) couldn't
exactly find that; but he (<font color='blue'><b>companion</b></font>) discovered enough to encourage him (<font color='blue'><b>companion</b></font>) to speak.

<p/>'<div class="bookquote">``You, and I,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Lord</b></font>) said, <div class="bookquote">``have each a great debt to settle with the man
out yonder! If we were neither of us cowards, we might combine to
discharge it. Are you as soft as your brother? Are you willing to
endure to the last, and not once attempt a repayment?''

 (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div><p/>'<div class="bookquote">``I'm weary of enduring now,''  (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div>I replied; <div class="bookquote">``and I'd be glad of a
retaliation that wouldn't recoil on myself; but treachery and violence
are spears pointed at both ends; they wound those who resort to them
worse than their enemies.''

 (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div><p/>'<div class="bookquote">``Treachery and violence are a just return for treachery and violence!''
 (<font color='red'><b>Hindley/Mr. Hindley</b></font>)</div>cried Hindley. <div class="bookquote">``Mrs. Heathcliff, I'll ask you to do nothing; but sit
still and be dumb. Tell me now, can you? I'm sure you would have as
much pleasure as I in witnessing the conclusion of the fiend's existence;
he (<font color='blue'><b>fiend</b></font>)'ll be _your_ death unless you overreach him (<font color='blue'><b>fiend</b></font>); and he (<font color='blue'><b>fiend</b></font>)'ll be _my_ ruin.
Damn the hellish villain! He (<font color='blue'><b>fiend</b></font>) knocks at the door as if he (<font color='blue'><b>fiend</b></font>) were master
here already! Promise to hold your tongue, and before that clock
strikes--it wants three minutes of one--you're a free woman!''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/>``He (<font color='blue'><b>fiend</b></font>) took the implements which I described to you in my letter from his (<font color='blue'><b>fiend</b></font>)
breast, and would have turned down the candle. I snatched it away,
however, and seized his (<font color='blue'><b>fiend</b></font>) arm.

<p/>'<div class="bookquote">``I'll not hold my tongue!''  (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div>I said; <div class="bookquote">``you mustn't touch him (<font color='blue'><b>fiend</b></font>). Let the door
remain shut, and be quiet!''

 (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div><p/>'<div class="bookquote">``No! I've formed my resolution, and by God I'll execute it!''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>cried the
desperate being. <div class="bookquote">``I'll do you a kindness in spite of yourself, and
Hareton justice! And you needn't trouble your head to screen me;
Catherine is gone. Nobody alive would regret me, or be ashamed, though I
cut my throat this minute--and it's time to make an end!''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/>``I might as well have struggled with a bear, or reasoned with a lunatic.
The only resource left me was to run to a lattice and warn his (<font color='blue'><b>God</b></font>) intended
victim of the fate which awaited him (<font color='blue'><b>God</b></font>).

<p/>'<div class="bookquote">``You'd better seek shelter somewhere else to-night!''  (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div>I exclaimed, in
rather a triumphant tone. <div class="bookquote">``Mr. Earnshaw has a mind to shoot you, if you
persist in endeavouring to enter.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/>'<div class="bookquote">``You'd better open the door, you--''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Hindley</b></font>) answered, addressing me by some
elegant term that I don't care to repeat.

<p/>'<div class="bookquote">``I shall not meddle in the matter,''  (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div>I retorted again. <div class="bookquote">``Come in and get
shot, if you please. I've done my duty.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/>``With that I shut the window and returned to my place by the fire; having
too small a stock of hypocrisy at my command to pretend any anxiety for
the danger that menaced him (<font color='blue'><b>Earnshaw</b></font>). Earnshaw swore passionately at me:
affirming that I loved the villain yet; and calling me all sorts of names
for the base spirit I evinced. And I, in my secret heart -LRB-and conscience
never reproached me-RRB-, thought what a blessing it would be for _him (<font color='blue'><b>villain</b></font>)_
should Heathcliff put him (<font color='blue'><b>Heathcliff</b></font>) out of misery; and what a blessing for _me_
should he (<font color='blue'><b>Heathcliff</b></font>) send Heathcliff to his (<font color='blue'><b>Heathcliff</b></font>) right abode! As I sat nursing these
reflections, the casement behind me was banged on to the floor by a blow
from the latter individual, and his (<font color='blue'><b>individual</b></font>) black countenance looked blightingly
through. The stanchions stood too close to suffer his (<font color='blue'><b>individual</b></font>) shoulders to
follow, and I smiled, exulting in my fancied security. His (<font color='blue'><b>individual</b></font>) hair and
clothes were whitened with snow, and his (<font color='blue'><b>individual</b></font>) sharp cannibal teeth, revealed
by cold and wrath, gleamed through the dark.

<p/>'<div class="bookquote">``Isabella, let me in, or I'll make you repent!''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Hindley</b></font>) <div class="bookquote">``girned,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>as Joseph
calls it.

<p/>'<div class="bookquote">``I cannot commit murder,''  (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div>I replied. <div class="bookquote">``Mr. Hindley stands sentinel with
a knife and loaded pistol.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/>'<div class="bookquote">``Let me in by the kitchen door,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Joseph</b></font>) said.

<p/>'<div class="bookquote">``Hindley will be there before me,''  (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div>I answered: <div class="bookquote">``and that's a poor love
of yours that cannot bear a shower of snow! We were left at peace in our
beds as long as the summer moon shone, but the moment a blast of winter
returns, you must run for shelter! Heathcliff, if I were you, I'd go
stretch myself over her (<font color='blue'><b>I</b></font>) grave and die like a faithful dog. The world is
surely not worth living in now, is it? You had distinctly impressed on
me the idea that Catherine was the whole joy of your life: I can't
imagine how you think of surviving her (<font color='blue'><b>Catherine</b></font>) loss.''

 (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div><p/>'<div class="bookquote">``He (<font color='blue'><b>Heathcliff</b></font>)'s there, is he (<font color='blue'><b>Heathcliff</b></font>)?''  (<font color='red'><b>companion</b></font>)</div>exclaimed my companion, rushing to the gap. <div class="bookquote">``If I
can get my arm out I can hit him (<font color='blue'><b>Heathcliff</b></font>)!''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/>``I'm afraid, Ellen, you'll set me down as really wicked; but you don't
know all, so don't judge. I wouldn't have aided or abetted an attempt on
even _his (<font color='blue'><b>judge</b></font>)_ life for anything. Wish that he (<font color='blue'><b>judge</b></font>) were dead, I must; and
therefore I was fearfully disappointed, and unnerved by terror for the
consequences of my taunting speech, when he (<font color='blue'><b>judge</b></font>) flung himself on Earnshaw's
weapon and wrenched it from his (<font color='blue'><b>judge</b></font>) grasp.

<p/>``The charge exploded, and the knife, in springing back, closed into its
owner's wrist. Heathcliff pulled it away by main force, slitting up the
flesh as it passed on, and thrust it dripping into his (<font color='blue'><b>Heathcliff</b></font>) pocket. He (<font color='blue'><b>Heathcliff</b></font>) then
took a stone, struck down the division between two windows, and sprang
in. His (<font color='blue'><b>Heathcliff</b></font>) adversary had fallen senseless with excessive pain and the flow
of blood, that gushed from an artery or a large vein. The ruffian kicked
and trampled on him (<font color='blue'><b>Heathcliff</b></font>), and dashed his (<font color='blue'><b>Heathcliff</b></font>) head repeatedly against the flags,
holding me with one hand, meantime, to prevent me summoning Joseph. He (<font color='blue'><b>Joseph</b></font>)
exerted preterhuman self-denial in abstaining from finishing him (<font color='blue'><b>Joseph</b></font>)
completely; but getting out of breath, he (<font color='blue'><b>Joseph</b></font>) finally desisted, and dragged
the apparently inanimate body on to the settle. There he (<font color='blue'><b>Joseph</b></font>) tore off the
sleeve of Earnshaw's coat, and bound up the wound with brutal roughness;
spitting and cursing during the operation as energetically as he (<font color='blue'><b>Joseph</b></font>) had
kicked before. Being at liberty, I lost no time in seeking the old
servant; who, having gathered by degrees the purport of my hasty tale,
hurried below, gasping, as he (<font color='blue'><b>servant</b></font>) descended the steps two at once.

<p/>'<div class="bookquote">``What is ther to do, now? what is ther to do, now?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/>'<div class="bookquote">``There's this to do,''  (<font color='red'><b>Heathcliff/Mr. Heathcliff</b></font>)</div>thundered Heathcliff, <div class="bookquote">``that your master's mad; and
should he (<font color='blue'><b>master</b></font>) last another month, I'll have him (<font color='blue'><b>master</b></font>) to an asylum. And how the
devil did you come to fasten me out, you toothless hound? Don't stand
muttering and mumbling there. Come, I'm not going to nurse him (<font color='blue'><b>devil</b></font>). Wash
that stuff away; and mind the sparks of your candle--it is more than half
brandy!''

 (<font color='red'><b>Heathcliff/Mr. Heathcliff</b></font>)</div><p/>'<div class="bookquote">``And so ye've been murthering on him (<font color='blue'><b>devil</b></font>)?''  (<font color='red'><b>Joseph</b></font>)</div>exclaimed Joseph, lifting his (<font color='blue'><b>Heathcliff</b></font>)
hands and eyes in horror. <div class="bookquote">``If iver I seed a seeght loike this! May the
Lord--''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/>``Heathcliff gave him (<font color='blue'><b>Heathcliff</b></font>) a push on to his (<font color='blue'><b>Heathcliff</b></font>) knees in the middle of the blood,
and flung a towel to him (<font color='blue'><b>Heathcliff</b></font>); but instead of proceeding to dry it up, he (<font color='blue'><b>Heathcliff</b></font>)
joined his (<font color='blue'><b>Heathcliff</b></font>) hands and began a prayer, which excited my laughter from its
odd phraseology. I was in the condition of mind to be shocked at
nothing: in fact, I was as reckless as some malefactors show themselves
at the foot of the gallows.

<p/>'<div class="bookquote">``Oh, I forgot you,''  (<font color='red'><b>the tyrant</b></font>)</div>said the tyrant. <div class="bookquote">``You shall do that. Down with
you. And you conspire with him (<font color='blue'><b>Heathcliff</b></font>) against me, do you, viper? There, that
is work fit for you!''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/>``He (<font color='blue'><b>Heathcliff</b></font>) shook me till my teeth rattled, and pitched me beside Joseph, who
steadily concluded his (<font color='blue'><b>Joseph</b></font>) supplications, and then rose, vowing he (<font color='blue'><b>Joseph</b></font>) would set
off for the Grange directly. Mr. Linton was a magistrate, and though he (<font color='blue'><b>Linton</b></font>)
had fifty wives dead, he (<font color='blue'><b>Linton</b></font>) should inquire into this. He (<font color='blue'><b>Linton</b></font>) was so obstinate
in his (<font color='blue'><b>Linton</b></font>) resolution, that Heathcliff deemed it expedient to compel from my
lips a recapitulation of what had taken place; standing over me, heaving
with malevolence, as I reluctantly delivered the account in answer to his (<font color='blue'><b>Heathcliff</b></font>)
questions. It required a great deal of labour to satisfy the old man
that Heathcliff was not the aggressor; especially with my hardly-wrung
replies. However, Mr. Earnshaw soon convinced him (<font color='blue'><b>Earnshaw</b></font>) that he (<font color='blue'><b>Earnshaw</b></font>) was alive
still; Joseph hastened to administer a dose of spirits, and by their
succour his (<font color='blue'><b>Joseph</b></font>) master presently regained motion and consciousness.
Heathcliff, aware that his (<font color='blue'><b>Heathcliff</b></font>) opponent was ignorant of the treatment
received while insensible, called him (<font color='blue'><b>Heathcliff</b></font>) deliriously intoxicated; and said
he (<font color='blue'><b>Heathcliff</b></font>) should not notice his (<font color='blue'><b>Heathcliff</b></font>) atrocious conduct further, but advised him (<font color='blue'><b>Heathcliff</b></font>) to
get to bed. To my joy, he (<font color='blue'><b>Heathcliff</b></font>) left us, after giving this judicious counsel,
and Hindley stretched himself on the hearthstone. I departed to my own
room, marvelling that I had escaped so easily.

<p/>``This morning, when I came down, about half an hour before noon, Mr.
Earnshaw was sitting by the fire, deadly sick; his (<font color='blue'><b>Earnshaw</b></font>) evil genius, almost as
gaunt and ghastly, leant against the chimney. Neither appeared inclined
to dine, and, having waited till all was cold on the table, I commenced
alone. Nothing hindered me from eating heartily, and I experienced a
certain sense of satisfaction and superiority, as, at intervals, I cast a
look towards my silent companions, and felt the comfort of a quiet
conscience within me. After I had done, I ventured on the unusual
liberty of drawing near the fire, going round Earnshaw's seat, and
kneeling in the corner beside him (<font color='blue'><b>me</b></font>).

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Heathcliff did not glance my way, and I gazed up, and contemplated his (<font color='blue'><b>Heathcliff</b></font>)
features almost as confidently as if they had been turned to stone. His (<font color='blue'><b>Heathcliff</b></font>)
forehead, that I once thought so manly, and that I now think so
diabolical, was shaded with a heavy cloud; his (<font color='blue'><b>Heathcliff</b></font>) basilisk eyes were nearly
quenched by sleeplessness, and weeping, perhaps, for the lashes were wet
then: his (<font color='blue'><b>Heathcliff</b></font>) lips devoid of their ferocious sneer, and sealed in an
expression of unspeakable sadness. Had it been another, I would have
covered my face in the presence of such grief. In _his (<font color='blue'><b>Heathcliff</b></font>)_ case, I was
gratified; and, ignoble as it seems to insult a fallen enemy, I couldn't
miss this chance of sticking in a dart: his (<font color='blue'><b>Heathcliff</b></font>) weakness was the only time
when I could taste the delight of paying wrong for wrong.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Fie, fie, Miss!''  (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div>I interrupted. <div class="bookquote">``One might suppose you had never opened
a Bible in your life. If God afflict your enemies, surely that ought to
suffice you. It is both mean and presumptuous to add your torture to
his (<font color='blue'><b>God</b></font>)!''

misery laid on Heathcliff could content me, unless I have a hand in it?
I'd rather he (<font color='blue'><b>Heathcliff</b></font>) suffered less, if I might cause his (<font color='blue'><b>Heathcliff</b></font>) sufferings and he (<font color='blue'><b>Heathcliff</b></font>) might
_know_ that I was the cause. Oh, I owe him (<font color='blue'><b>Heathcliff</b></font>) so much. On only one
condition can I hope to forgive him (<font color='blue'><b>Heathcliff</b></font>). It is, if I may take an eye for an
eye, a tooth for a tooth; for every wrench of agony return a wrench:
reduce him (<font color='blue'><b>Heathcliff</b></font>) to my level. As he (<font color='blue'><b>Heathcliff</b></font>) was the first to injure, make him (<font color='blue'><b>Heathcliff</b></font>) the
first to implore pardon; and then--why then, Ellen, I might show you some
generosity. But it is utterly impossible I can ever be revenged, and
therefore I cannot forgive him (<font color='blue'><b>Heathcliff</b></font>). Hindley wanted some water, and I handed
him (<font color='blue'><b>Hindley</b></font>) a glass, and asked him (<font color='blue'><b>Hindley</b></font>) how he (<font color='blue'><b>Hindley</b></font>) was.

<p/>'<div class="bookquote">``Not as ill as I wish,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Hindley</b></font>) replied. <div class="bookquote">``But leaving out my arm, every inch
of me is as sore as if I had been fighting with a legion of imps!''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/>'<div class="bookquote">``Yes, no wonder,''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>was my next remark. <div class="bookquote">``Catherine used to boast that she (<font color='blue'><b>Catherine</b></font>)
stood between you and bodily harm: she (<font color='blue'><b>Catherine</b></font>) meant that certain persons would
not hurt you for fear of offending her (<font color='blue'><b>Catherine</b></font>). It's well people don't _really_
rise from their grave, or, last night, she (<font color='blue'><b>Catherine</b></font>) might have witnessed a
repulsive scene! Are not you bruised, and cut over your chest and
shoulders?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/>'<div class="bookquote">``I can't say,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Hindley</b></font>) answered, <div class="bookquote">``but what do you mean? Did he (<font color='blue'><b>Catherine</b></font>) dare to
strike me when I was down?''

 (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div><p/>'<div class="bookquote">``He (<font color='blue'><b>Catherine</b></font>) trampled on and kicked you, and dashed you on the ground,''  (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div>I
whispered. <div class="bookquote">``And his (<font color='blue'><b>Catherine</b></font>) mouth watered to tear you with his (<font color='blue'><b>Catherine</b></font>) teeth; because
he (<font color='blue'><b>Catherine</b></font>)'s only half man: not so much, and the rest fiend.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/>``Mr. Earnshaw looked up, like me, to the countenance of our mutual foe;
who, absorbed in his (<font color='blue'><b>Earnshaw</b></font>) anguish, seemed insensible to anything around him (<font color='blue'><b>Earnshaw</b></font>):
the longer he (<font color='blue'><b>Earnshaw</b></font>) stood, the plainer his (<font color='blue'><b>Earnshaw</b></font>) reflections revealed their blackness
through his (<font color='blue'><b>Earnshaw</b></font>) features.

<p/>'<div class="bookquote">``Oh, if God would but give me strength to strangle him (<font color='blue'><b>God</b></font>) in my last agony,
I'd go to hell with joy,''  (<font color='red'><b>the man</b></font>)</div>groaned the impatient man, writhing to rise,
and sinking back in despair, convinced of his (<font color='blue'><b>Hindley</b></font>) inadequacy for the
struggle.

<p/>'<div class="bookquote">``Nay, it's enough that he (<font color='blue'><b>God</b></font>) has murdered one of you,''  (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div>I observed aloud.
<div class="bookquote">``At the Grange, every one knows your sister would have been living now
had it not been for Mr. Heathcliff. After all, it is preferable to be
hated than loved by him (<font color='blue'><b>Heathcliff</b></font>). When I recollect how happy we were--how happy
Catherine was before he (<font color='blue'><b>Heathcliff</b></font>) came--I'm fit to curse the day.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/>``Most likely, Heathcliff noticed more the truth of what was said, than
the spirit of the person who said it. His (<font color='blue'><b>Heathcliff</b></font>) attention was roused, I saw,
for his (<font color='blue'><b>Heathcliff</b></font>) eyes rained down tears among the ashes, and he (<font color='blue'><b>Heathcliff</b></font>) drew his (<font color='blue'><b>Heathcliff</b></font>) breath in
suffocating sighs. I stared full at him (<font color='blue'><b>Heathcliff</b></font>), and laughed scornfully. The
clouded windows of hell flashed a moment towards me; the fiend which
usually looked out, however, was so dimmed and drowned that I did not
fear to hazard another sound of derision.

<p/>'<div class="bookquote">``Get up, and begone out of my sight,''  (<font color='red'><b>the mourner</b></font>)</div>said the mourner.

<p/>``I guessed he (<font color='blue'><b>fiend</b></font>) uttered those words, at least, though his (<font color='blue'><b>fiend</b></font>) voice was hardly
intelligible.

<p/>'<div class="bookquote">``I beg your pardon,''  (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div>I replied. <div class="bookquote">``But I loved Catherine too; and her (<font color='blue'><b>Catherine</b></font>)

that she (<font color='blue'><b>Catherine</b></font>)'s dead, I see her (<font color='blue'><b>Catherine</b></font>) in Hindley: Hindley has exactly her (<font color='blue'><b>Hindley</b></font>) eyes, if
you had not tried to gouge them out, and made them black and red; and
her (<font color='blue'><b>Hindley</b></font>)--''

 (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div><p/>'<div class="bookquote">``Get up, wretched idiot, before I stamp you to death!''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>mourner</b></font>) cried, making
a movement that caused me to make one also.

<p/>'<div class="bookquote">``But then,''  (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div>I continued, holding myself ready to flee, <div class="bookquote">``if poor
Catherine had trusted you, and assumed the ridiculous, contemptible,
degrading title of Mrs. Heathcliff, she (<font color='blue'><b>Heathcliff</b></font>) would soon have presented a
similar picture! _She (<font color='blue'><b>Heathcliff</b></font>)_ wouldn't have borne your abominable behaviour
quietly: her (<font color='blue'><b>Heathcliff</b></font>) detestation and disgust must have found voice.''

 (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``The back of the settle and Earnshaw's person interposed between me and
him (<font color='blue'><b>idiot</b></font>); so instead of endeavouring to reach me, he (<font color='blue'><b>idiot</b></font>) snatched a dinner-knife
from the table and flung it at my head. It struck beneath my ear, and
stopped the sentence I was uttering; but, pulling it out, I sprang to the
door and delivered another; which I hope went a little deeper than his (<font color='blue'><b>idiot</b></font>)
missile. The last glimpse I caught of him (<font color='blue'><b>idiot</b></font>) was a furious rush on his (<font color='blue'><b>idiot</b></font>)
part, checked by the embrace of his (<font color='blue'><b>idiot</b></font>) host; and both fell locked together
on the hearth. In my flight through the kitchen I bid Joseph speed to
his (<font color='blue'><b>Joseph</b></font>) master; I knocked over Hareton, who was hanging a litter of puppies
from a chair-back in the doorway; and, blessed as a soul escaped from
purgatory, I bounded, leaped, and flew down the steep road; then,
quitting its windings, shot direct across the moor, rolling over banks,
and wading through marshes: precipitating myself, in fact, towards the
beacon-light of the Grange. And far rather would I be condemned to a
perpetual dwelling in the infernal regions than, even for one night,
abide beneath the roof of Wuthering Heights again.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Isabella/Isabella Linton/ISABELLA</b></font>)</div><p/>Isabella ceased speaking, and took a drink of tea; then she (<font color='blue'><b>Isabella</b></font>) rose, and
bidding me put on her (<font color='blue'><b>Isabella</b></font>) bonnet, and a great shawl I had brought, and
turning a deaf ear to my entreaties for her (<font color='blue'><b>Isabella</b></font>) to remain another hour, she (<font color='blue'><b>Isabella</b></font>)
stepped on to a chair, kissed Edgar's and Catherine's portraits, bestowed
a similar salute on me, and descended to the carriage, accompanied by
Fanny, who yelped wild with joy at recovering her (<font color='blue'><b>Fanny</b></font>) mistress. She (<font color='blue'><b>Fanny</b></font>) was
driven away, never to revisit this neighbourhood: but a regular
correspondence was established between her (<font color='blue'><b>Fanny</b></font>) and my master when things were
more settled. I believe her (<font color='blue'><b>Fanny</b></font>) new abode was in the south, near London;
there she (<font color='blue'><b>Fanny</b></font>) had a son born a few months subsequent to her (<font color='blue'><b>Fanny</b></font>) escape. He (<font color='blue'><b>son</b></font>) was
christened Linton, and, from the first, she (<font color='blue'><b>Fanny</b></font>) reported him (<font color='blue'><b>son</b></font>) to be an ailing,
peevish creature.

<p/>Mr. Heathcliff, meeting me one day in the village, inquired where she (<font color='blue'><b>Fanny</b></font>)
lived. I refused to tell. He (<font color='blue'><b>Heathcliff</b></font>) remarked that it was not of any moment,
only she (<font color='blue'><b>Fanny</b></font>) must beware of coming to her (<font color='blue'><b>Fanny</b></font>) brother: she (<font color='blue'><b>Fanny</b></font>) should not be with
him (<font color='blue'><b>brother</b></font>), if he (<font color='blue'><b>brother</b></font>) had to keep her (<font color='blue'><b>Fanny</b></font>) himself. Though I would give no information,
he (<font color='blue'><b>brother</b></font>) discovered, through some of the other servants, both her (<font color='blue'><b>Fanny</b></font>) place of
residence and the existence of the child. Still, he (<font color='blue'><b>brother</b></font>) didn't molest her (<font color='blue'><b>Fanny</b></font>):
for which forbearance she (<font color='blue'><b>Fanny</b></font>) might thank his (<font color='blue'><b>brother</b></font>) aversion, I suppose. He (<font color='blue'><b>brother</b></font>) often
asked about the infant, when he (<font color='blue'><b>brother</b></font>) saw me; and on hearing its name, smiled
grimly, and observed: <div class="bookquote">``They wish me to hate it too, do they?''

 (<font color='red'><b>me</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I don't think they wish you to know anything about it,''  (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div>I answered.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``But I'll have it,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>brother</b></font>) said, `when I want it. They may reckon on that!''

<p/>Fortunately its mother died before the time arrived; some thirteen years
after the decease of Catherine, when Linton was twelve, or a little more.

<p/>On the day succeeding Isabella's unexpected visit I had no opportunity of
speaking to my master: he (<font color='blue'><b>master</b></font>) shunned conversation, and was fit for
discussing nothing. When I could get him (<font color='blue'><b>master</b></font>) to listen, I saw it pleased him (<font color='blue'><b>master</b></font>)
that his (<font color='blue'><b>master</b></font>) sister had left her (<font color='blue'><b>sister</b></font>) husband; whom he (<font color='blue'><b>master</b></font>) abhorred with an intensity
which the mildness of his (<font color='blue'><b>master</b></font>) nature would scarcely seem to allow. So deep
and sensitive was his (<font color='blue'><b>master</b></font>) aversion, that he (<font color='blue'><b>master</b></font>) refrained from going anywhere
where he (<font color='blue'><b>master</b></font>) was likely to see or hear of Heathcliff. Grief, and that
together, transformed him (<font color='blue'><b>Heathcliff</b></font>) into a complete hermit: he (<font color='blue'><b>Heathcliff</b></font>) threw up his (<font color='blue'><b>Heathcliff</b></font>) office
of magistrate, ceased even to attend church, avoided the village on all
occasions, and spent a life of entire seclusion within the limits of his (<font color='blue'><b>Heathcliff</b></font>)
park and grounds; only varied by solitary rambles on the moors, and
visits to the grave of his (<font color='blue'><b>Heathcliff</b></font>) wife, mostly at evening, or early morning
before other wanderers were abroad. But he (<font color='blue'><b>Heathcliff</b></font>) was too good to be thoroughly
unhappy long. _He (<font color='blue'><b>Heathcliff</b></font>)_ didn't pray for Catherine's soul to haunt him (<font color='blue'><b>Heathcliff</b></font>). Time
brought resignation, and a melancholy sweeter than common joy. He (<font color='blue'><b>Heathcliff</b></font>)
recalled her (<font color='blue'><b>Catherine</b></font>) memory with ardent, tender love, and hopeful aspiring to the
better world; where he (<font color='blue'><b>Heathcliff</b></font>) doubted not she (<font color='blue'><b>Catherine</b></font>) was gone.

<p/>And he (<font color='blue'><b>Heathcliff</b></font>) had earthly consolation and affections also. For a few days, I
said, he (<font color='blue'><b>Heathcliff</b></font>) seemed regardless of the puny successor to the departed: that
coldness melted as fast as snow in April, and ere the tiny thing could
stammer a word or totter a step it wielded a despot's sceptre in his (<font color='blue'><b>despot</b></font>)
heart. It was named Catherine; but he (<font color='blue'><b>despot</b></font>) never called it the name in full,
as he (<font color='blue'><b>despot</b></font>) had never called the first Catherine short: probably because
Heathcliff had a habit of doing so. The little one was always Cathy: it
formed to him (<font color='blue'><b>Heathcliff</b></font>) a distinction from the mother, and yet a connection with
her (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>); and his (<font color='blue'><b>Heathcliff</b></font>) attachment sprang from its relation to her (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>), far more than
from its being his (<font color='blue'><b>Heathcliff</b></font>) own.

<p/>I used to draw a comparison between him (<font color='blue'><b>Heathcliff</b></font>) and Hindley Earnshaw, and perplex
myself to explain satisfactorily why their conduct was so opposite in
similar circumstances. They had both been fond husbands, and were both
attached to their children; and I could not see how they shouldn't both
have taken the same road, for good or evil. But, I thought in my mind,
Hindley, with apparently the stronger head, has shown himself sadly the
worse and the weaker man. When his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) ship struck, the captain abandoned
his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) post; and the crew, instead of trying to save her (<font color='blue'><b>children</b></font>), rushed into riot
and confusion, leaving no hope for their luckless vessel. Linton, on the
contrary, displayed the true courage of a loyal and faithful soul: he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>)
trusted God; and God comforted him (<font color='blue'><b>God</b></font>). One hoped, and the other despaired:
they chose their own lots, and were righteously doomed to endure them.
But you'll not want to hear my moralising, Mr. Lockwood; you'll judge, as
well as I can, all these things: at least, you'll think you will, and
that's the same. The end of Earnshaw was what might have been expected;
it followed fast on his (<font color='blue'><b>Lockwood</b></font>) sister's: there were scarcely six months between
them. We, at the Grange, never got a very succinct account of his (<font color='blue'><b>Lockwood</b></font>) state
preceding it; all that I did learn was on occasion of going to aid in the
preparations for the funeral. Mr. Kenneth came to announce the event to
my master.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Well, Nelly,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>said he (<font color='blue'><b>Kenneth</b></font>), riding into the yard one morning, too early not
to alarm me with an instant presentiment of bad news, `it's yours and my
turn to go into mourning at present. Who's given us the slip now, do you
think?''

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Who?''  (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div>I asked in a flurry.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Why, guess!''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Kenneth</b></font>) returned, dismounting, and slinging his (<font color='blue'><b>Kenneth</b></font>) bridle on a hook
by the door. <div class="bookquote">``And nip up the corner of your apron: I'm certain you'll
need it.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Not Mr. Heathcliff, surely?''  (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div>I exclaimed.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``What! would you have tears for him (<font color='blue'><b>Heathcliff</b></font>)?''  (<font color='red'><b>the doctor</b></font>)</div>said the doctor. <div class="bookquote">``No, Heathcliff's
a tough young fellow: he (<font color='blue'><b>Heathcliff</b></font>) looks blooming to-day. I've just seen him (<font color='blue'><b>Heathcliff</b></font>). He (<font color='blue'><b>Heathcliff</b></font>)'s
rapidly regaining flesh since he (<font color='blue'><b>Heathcliff</b></font>) lost his (<font color='blue'><b>Heathcliff</b></font>) better half.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Who is it, then, Mr. Kenneth?''  (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div>I repeated impatiently.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Hindley Earnshaw! Your old friend Hindley,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>doctor</b></font>) replied, `and my wicked
gossip: though he (<font color='blue'><b>doctor</b></font>)'s been too wild for me this long while. There! I said
we should draw water. But cheer up! He (<font color='blue'><b>doctor</b></font>) died true to his (<font color='blue'><b>doctor</b></font>) character:
drunk as a lord. Poor lad! I'm sorry, too. One can't help missing an
old companion: though he (<font color='blue'><b>companion</b></font>) had the worst tricks with him (<font color='blue'><b>companion</b></font>) that ever man
imagined, and has done me many a rascally turn. He (<font color='blue'><b>companion</b></font>)'s barely
twenty-seven, it seems; that's your own age: who would have thought you
were born in one year?''

<p/>I confess this blow was greater to me than the shock of Mrs. Linton's
death: ancient associations lingered round my heart; I sat down in the
porch and wept as for a blood relation, desiring Mr. Kenneth to get
another servant to introduce him (<font color='blue'><b>Kenneth</b></font>) to the master. I could not hinder
myself from pondering on the question--<div class="bookquote">``Had he (<font color='blue'><b>Hindley</b></font>) had fair play?''  (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div>Whatever
I did, that idea would bother me: it was so tiresomely pertinacious that
I resolved on requesting leave to go to Wuthering Heights, and assist in
the last duties to the dead. Mr. Linton was extremely reluctant to
consent, but I pleaded eloquently for the friendless condition in which
he (<font color='blue'><b>Linton</b></font>) lay; and I said my old master and foster-brother had a claim on my
services as strong as his (<font color='blue'><b>master</b></font>) own. Besides, I reminded him (<font color='blue'><b>master</b></font>) that the child
Hareton was his (<font color='blue'><b>Hareton</b></font>) wife's nephew, and, in the absence of nearer kin, he (<font color='blue'><b>Hareton</b></font>)
ought to act as its guardian; and he (<font color='blue'><b>Hareton</b></font>) ought to and must inquire how the
property was left, and look over the concerns of his (<font color='blue'><b>Hareton</b></font>) brother-in-law. He (<font color='blue'><b>Hareton</b></font>)
was unfit for attending to such matters then, but he (<font color='blue'><b>Hareton</b></font>) bid me speak to his (<font color='blue'><b>Hareton</b></font>)
lawyer; and at length permitted me to go. His (<font color='blue'><b>Hareton</b></font>) lawyer had been Earnshaw's
also: I called at the village, and asked him (<font color='blue'><b>Hareton</b></font>) to accompany me. He (<font color='blue'><b>Hareton</b></font>) shook
his (<font color='blue'><b>Hareton</b></font>) head, and advised that Heathcliff should be let alone; affirming, if
the truth were known, Hareton would be found little else than a beggar.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``His (<font color='blue'><b>Hindley</b></font>) father died in debt,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Hareton</b></font>) said; `the whole property is mortgaged, and
the sole chance for the natural heir is to allow him (<font color='blue'><b>heir</b></font>) an opportunity of
creating some interest in the creditor's heart, that he (<font color='blue'><b>heir</b></font>) may be inclined
to deal leniently towards him (<font color='blue'><b>heir</b></font>).''

<p/>When I reached the Heights, I explained that I had come to see everything
carried on decently; and Joseph, who appeared in sufficient distress,
expressed satisfaction at my presence. Mr. Heathcliff said he (<font color='blue'><b>Heathcliff</b></font>) did not
perceive that I was wanted; but I might stay and order the arrangements
for the funeral, if I chose.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Correctly,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Heathcliff</b></font>) remarked, `that fool's body should be buried at the
cross-roads, without ceremony of any kind. I happened to leave him (<font color='blue'><b>Heathcliff</b></font>) ten
minutes yesterday afternoon, and in that interval he (<font color='blue'><b>Heathcliff</b></font>) fastened the two
doors of the house against me, and he (<font color='blue'><b>Heathcliff</b></font>) has spent the night in drinking
himself to death deliberately! We broke in this morning, for we heard
him (<font color='blue'><b>Heathcliff</b></font>) sporting like a horse; and there he (<font color='blue'><b>Heathcliff</b></font>) was, laid over the settle:
flaying and scalping would not have wakened him (<font color='blue'><b>Heathcliff</b></font>). I sent for Kenneth, and
he (<font color='blue'><b>Kenneth</b></font>) came; but not till the beast had changed into carrion: he (<font color='blue'><b>Kenneth</b></font>) was both
dead and cold, and stark; and so you'll allow it was useless making more
stir about him (<font color='blue'><b>Kenneth</b></font>)!''

<p/>The old servant confirmed this statement, but muttered:

<p/><div class="bookquote">``I'd rayther he (<font color='blue'><b>Hindley</b></font>)'d goan hisseln for t' doctor! I sud ha' taen tent o' t'
maister better nor him (<font color='blue'><b>Hindley</b></font>)--and he (<font color='blue'><b>Hindley</b></font>) warn't deead when I left, naught o' t'
soart!''

 (<font color='red'><b>The servant</b></font>)</div><p/>I insisted on the funeral being respectable. Mr. Heathcliff said I might
have my own way there too: only, he (<font color='blue'><b>Heathcliff</b></font>) desired me to remember that the money
for the whole affair came out of his (<font color='blue'><b>Heathcliff</b></font>) pocket. He (<font color='blue'><b>Heathcliff</b></font>) maintained a hard,
careless deportment, indicative of neither joy nor sorrow: if anything,
it expressed a flinty gratification at a piece of difficult work
successfully executed. I observed once, indeed, something like
exultation in his (<font color='blue'><b>Heathcliff</b></font>) aspect: it was just when the people were bearing the
coffin from the house. He (<font color='blue'><b>Heathcliff</b></font>) had the hypocrisy to represent a mourner: and
previous to following with Hareton, he (<font color='blue'><b>Hareton</b></font>) lifted the unfortunate child on to
the table and muttered, with peculiar gusto, <div class="bookquote">``Now, my bonny lad, you are
_mine_! And we'll see if one tree won't grow as crooked as another, with
the same wind to twist it!''  (<font color='red'><b>the child</b></font>)</div>The unsuspecting thing was pleased at this
speech: he (<font color='blue'><b>Hareton</b></font>) played with Heathcliff's whiskers, and stroked his (<font color='blue'><b>Hareton</b></font>) cheek; but
I divined its meaning, and observed tartly, <div class="bookquote">``That boy must go back with
me to Thrushcross Grange, sir. There is nothing in the world less yours
than he (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>) is!''

 (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Does Linton say so?''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Hareton</b></font>) demanded.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Of course--he (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>) has ordered me to take him (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>),''  (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div>I replied.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Well,''  (<font color='red'><b>the scoundrel</b></font>)</div>said the scoundrel, `we'll not argue the subject now: but I have
a fancy to try my hand at rearing a young one; so intimate to your master
that I must supply the place of this with my own, if he (<font color='blue'><b>master</b></font>) attempt to remove
it. I don't engage to let Hareton go undisputed; but I'll be pretty sure
to make the other come! Remember to tell him (<font color='blue'><b>Hareton</b></font>).''

<p/>This hint was enough to bind our hands. I repeated its substance on my
return; and Edgar Linton, little interested at the commencement, spoke no
more of interfering. I'm not aware that he (<font color='blue'><b>Linton</b></font>) could have done it to any
purpose, had he (<font color='blue'><b>Linton</b></font>) been ever so willing.

<p/>The guest was now the master of Wuthering Heights: he (<font color='blue'><b>guest</b></font>) held firm
possession, and proved to the attorney--who, in his (<font color='blue'><b>guest</b></font>) turn, proved it to
Mr. Linton--that Earnshaw had mortgaged every yard of land he (<font color='blue'><b>Linton</b></font>) owned for
cash to supply his (<font color='blue'><b>Linton</b></font>) mania for gaming; and he (<font color='blue'><b>Linton</b></font>), Heathcliff, was the
mortgagee. In that manner Hareton, who should now be the first gentleman
in the neighbourhood, was reduced to a state of complete dependence on
his (<font color='blue'><b>gentleman</b></font>) father's inveterate enemy; and lives in his (<font color='blue'><b>gentleman</b></font>) own house as a servant,
deprived of the advantage of wages: quite unable to right himself,
because of his (<font color='blue'><b>gentleman</b></font>) friendlessness, and his (<font color='blue'><b>gentleman</b></font>) ignorance that he (<font color='blue'><b>gentleman</b></font>) has been
wronged.




<p/>CHAPTER XVIII


<p/>The twelve years, continued Mrs. Dean, following that dismal period were
the happiest of my life: my greatest troubles in their passage rose from
our little lady's trifling illnesses, which she (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) had to experience in
common with all children, rich and poor. For the rest, after the first
six months, she (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) grew like a larch, and could walk and talk too, in her (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>)
own way, before the heath blossomed a second time over Mrs. Linton's
dust. She (<font color='blue'><b>Linton</b></font>) was the most winning thing that ever brought sunshine into a
desolate house: a real beauty in face, with the Earnshaws' handsome dark
eyes, but the Lintons' fair skin and small features, and yellow curling
hair. Her (<font color='blue'><b>Linton</b></font>) spirit was high, though not rough, and qualified by a heart
sensitive and lively to excess in its affections. That capacity for
intense attachments reminded me of her (<font color='blue'><b>Linton</b></font>) mother: still she (<font color='blue'><b>Linton</b></font>) did not resemble
her (<font color='blue'><b>Linton</b></font>): for she (<font color='blue'><b>Linton</b></font>) could be soft and mild as a dove, and she (<font color='blue'><b>Linton</b></font>) had a gentle voice
and pensive expression: her (<font color='blue'><b>Linton</b></font>) anger was never furious; her (<font color='blue'><b>Linton</b></font>) love never
fierce: it was deep and tender. However, it must be acknowledged, she (<font color='blue'><b>Linton</b></font>)
had faults to foil her (<font color='blue'><b>Linton</b></font>) gifts. A propensity to be saucy was one; and a
perverse will, that indulged children invariably acquire, whether they be
good tempered or cross. If a servant chanced to vex her (<font color='blue'><b>Linton</b></font>), it was
always--<div class="bookquote">``I shall tell papa!''  (<font color='red'><b>her</b></font>)</div>And if he (<font color='blue'><b>they</b></font>) reproved her (<font color='blue'><b>Linton</b></font>), even by a look, you
would have thought it a heart-breaking business: I don't believe he (<font color='blue'><b>they</b></font>) ever
did speak a harsh word to her (<font color='blue'><b>Linton</b></font>). He (<font color='blue'><b>they</b></font>) took her (<font color='blue'><b>Linton</b></font>) education entirely on
himself, and made it an amusement. Fortunately, curiosity and a quick
intellect made her (<font color='blue'><b>Linton</b></font>) an apt scholar: she (<font color='blue'><b>Linton</b></font>) learned rapidly and eagerly, and
did honour to his (<font color='blue'><b>scholar</b></font>) teaching.

<p/>Till she (<font color='blue'><b>Linton</b></font>) reached the age of thirteen she (<font color='blue'><b>Linton</b></font>) had not once been beyond the
range of the park by herself. Mr. Linton would take her (<font color='blue'><b>Linton</b></font>) with him (<font color='blue'><b>Linton</b></font>) a mile
or so outside, on rare occasions; but he (<font color='blue'><b>Linton</b></font>) trusted her (<font color='blue'><b>Linton</b></font>) to no one else.
Gimmerton was an unsubstantial name in her (<font color='blue'><b>Linton</b></font>) ears; the chapel, the only
building she (<font color='blue'><b>Linton</b></font>) had approached or entered, except her (<font color='blue'><b>Linton</b></font>) own home. Wuthering
Heights and Mr. Heathcliff did not exist for her (<font color='blue'><b>Linton</b></font>): she (<font color='blue'><b>Linton</b></font>) was a perfect
recluse; and, apparently, perfectly contented. Sometimes, indeed, while
surveying the country from her (<font color='blue'><b>Linton</b></font>) nursery window, she (<font color='blue'><b>Linton</b></font>) would observe--

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Ellen, how long will it be before I can walk to the top of those hills?
I wonder what lies on the other side--is it the sea?''

 (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``No, Miss Cathy,''  (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div>I would answer; `it is hills again, just like these.''

<p/><div class="bookquote">``And what are those golden rocks like when you stand under them?''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Linton</b></font>)
once asked.

<p/>The abrupt descent of Penistone Crags particularly attracted her (<font color='blue'><b>Linton</b></font>) notice;
especially when the setting sun shone on it and the topmost heights, and
the whole extent of landscape besides lay in shadow. I explained that
they were bare masses of stone, with hardly enough earth in their clefts
to nourish a stunted tree.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``And why are they bright so long after it is evening here?''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Linton</b></font>) pursued.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Because they are a great deal higher up than we are,''  (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div>replied I; `you
could not climb them, they are too high and steep. In winter the frost
is always there before it comes to us; and deep into summer I have found
snow under that black hollow on the north-east side!''

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Oh, you have been on them!''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Linton</b></font>) cried gleefully. <div class="bookquote">``Then I can go, too,
when I am a woman. Has papa been, Ellen?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Papa would tell you, Miss,''  (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div>I answered, hastily, `that they are not
worth the trouble of visiting. The moors, where you ramble with him (<font color='blue'><b>them</b></font>), are
much nicer; and Thrushcross Park is the finest place in the world.''

<p/><div class="bookquote">``But I know the park, and I don't know those,''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Linton</b></font>) murmured to herself.
<div class="bookquote">``And I should delight to look round me from the brow of that tallest
point: my little pony Minny shall take me some time.''

 (<font color='red'><b>the maids</b></font>)</div><p/>One of the maids mentioning the Fairy Cave, quite turned her (<font color='blue'><b>Fairy</b></font>) head with a
desire to fulfil this project: she (<font color='blue'><b>Fairy</b></font>) teased Mr. Linton about it; and he (<font color='blue'><b>Linton</b></font>)
promised she (<font color='blue'><b>Fairy</b></font>) should have the journey when she (<font color='blue'><b>Fairy</b></font>) got older. But Miss
Catherine measured her (<font color='blue'><b>Catherine</b></font>) age by months, and, <div class="bookquote">``Now, am I old enough to go to
Penistone Crags?''  (<font color='red'><b>Miss Catherine</b></font>)</div>was the constant question in her (<font color='blue'><b>Catherine</b></font>) mouth. The road
thither wound close by Wuthering Heights. Edgar had not the heart to
pass it; so she (<font color='blue'><b>Catherine</b></font>) received as constantly the answer, <div class="bookquote">``Not yet, love: not
yet.''

 (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div><p/>I said Mrs. Heathcliff lived above a dozen years after quitting her (<font color='blue'><b>Heathcliff</b></font>)
husband. Her (<font color='blue'><b>Heathcliff</b></font>) family were of a delicate constitution: she (<font color='blue'><b>Heathcliff</b></font>) and Edgar both
lacked the ruddy health that you will generally meet in these parts. What
her (<font color='blue'><b>Heathcliff</b></font>) last illness was, I am not certain: I conjecture, they died of the
same thing, a kind of fever, slow at its commencement, but incurable, and
rapidly consuming life towards the close. She (<font color='blue'><b>Heathcliff</b></font>) wrote to inform her (<font color='blue'><b>Heathcliff</b></font>)
brother of the probable conclusion of a four-months' indisposition under
which she (<font color='blue'><b>Heathcliff</b></font>) had suffered, and entreated him (<font color='blue'><b>brother</b></font>) to come to her (<font color='blue'><b>Heathcliff</b></font>), if possible;
for she (<font color='blue'><b>Heathcliff</b></font>) had much to settle, and she (<font color='blue'><b>Heathcliff</b></font>) wished to bid him (<font color='blue'><b>brother</b></font>) adieu, and deliver
Linton safely into his (<font color='blue'><b>brother</b></font>) hands. Her (<font color='blue'><b>Linton</b></font>) hope was that Linton might be left
with him (<font color='blue'><b>brother</b></font>), as he (<font color='blue'><b>brother</b></font>) had been with her (<font color='blue'><b>Linton</b></font>): his (<font color='blue'><b>brother</b></font>) father, she (<font color='blue'><b>Linton</b></font>) would fain convince
herself, had no desire to assume the burden of his (<font color='blue'><b>brother</b></font>) maintenance or
education. My master hesitated not a moment in complying with her (<font color='blue'><b>Linton</b></font>)
request: reluctant as he (<font color='blue'><b>brother</b></font>) was to leave home at ordinary calls, he (<font color='blue'><b>brother</b></font>) flew to
answer this; commanding Catherine to my peculiar vigilance, in his (<font color='blue'><b>brother</b></font>)
absence, with reiterated orders that she (<font color='blue'><b>Catherine</b></font>) must not wander out of the park,
even under my escort he (<font color='blue'><b>brother</b></font>) did not calculate on her (<font color='blue'><b>Catherine</b></font>) going unaccompanied.

<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>brother</b></font>) was away three weeks. The first day or two my charge sat in a corner
of the library, too sad for either reading or playing: in that quiet
state she (<font color='blue'><b>Catherine</b></font>) caused me little trouble; but it was succeeded by an interval
of impatient, fretful weariness; and being too busy, and too old then, to
run up and down amusing her (<font color='blue'><b>Catherine</b></font>), I hit on a method by which she (<font color='blue'><b>Catherine</b></font>) might
entertain herself. I used to send her (<font color='blue'><b>Catherine</b></font>) on her (<font color='blue'><b>Catherine</b></font>) travels round the
grounds--now on foot, and now on a pony; indulging her (<font color='blue'><b>Catherine</b></font>) with a patient
audience of all her (<font color='blue'><b>Catherine</b></font>) real and imaginary adventures when she (<font color='blue'><b>Catherine</b></font>) returned.

<p/>The summer shone in full prime; and she (<font color='blue'><b>Catherine</b></font>) took such a taste for this
solitary rambling that she (<font color='blue'><b>Catherine</b></font>) often contrived to remain out from breakfast
till tea; and then the evenings were spent in recounting her (<font color='blue'><b>Catherine</b></font>) fanciful
tales. I did not fear her (<font color='blue'><b>Catherine</b></font>) breaking bounds; because the gates were
generally locked, and I thought she (<font color='blue'><b>Catherine</b></font>) would scarcely venture forth alone,
if they had stood wide open. Unluckily, my confidence proved misplaced.
Catherine came to me, one morning, at eight o'clock, and said she (<font color='blue'><b>Catherine</b></font>) was
that day an Arabian merchant, going to cross the Desert with his (<font color='blue'><b>merchant</b></font>) caravan;
and I must give her (<font color='blue'><b>Catherine</b></font>) plenty of provision for herself and beasts: a horse,
and three camels, personated by a large hound and a couple of pointers. I
got together good store of dainties, and slung them in a basket on one
side of the saddle; and she (<font color='blue'><b>Catherine</b></font>) sprang up as gay as a fairy, sheltered by her (<font color='blue'><b>Catherine</b></font>)
wide-brimmed hat and gauze veil from the July sun, and trotted off with a
merry laugh, mocking my cautious counsel to avoid galloping, and come
back early. The naughty thing never made her (<font color='blue'><b>Catherine</b></font>) appearance at tea. One
traveller, the hound, being an old dog and fond of its ease, returned;
but neither Cathy, nor the pony, nor the two pointers were visible in any
direction: I despatched emissaries down this path, and that path, and at
last went wandering in search of her (<font color='blue'><b>Cathy</b></font>) myself. There was a labourer
working at a fence round a plantation, on the borders of the grounds. I
inquired of him (<font color='blue'><b>labourer</b></font>) if he (<font color='blue'><b>labourer</b></font>) had seen our young lady.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``I saw her (<font color='blue'><b>Ellen</b></font>) at morn,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>labourer</b></font>) replied: `she (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) would have me to cut her (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) a hazel
switch, and then she (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) leapt her (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) Galloway over the hedge yonder, where it
is lowest, and galloped out of sight.''

<p/>You may guess how I felt at hearing this news. It struck me directly she (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>)
must have started for Penistone Crags. <div class="bookquote">``What will become of her (<font color='blue'><b>Ellen</b></font>)?''  (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div>I
ejaculated, pushing through a gap which the man was repairing, and making
straight to the high-road. I walked as if for a wager, mile after mile,
till a turn brought me in view of the Heights; but no Catherine could I
detect, far or near. The Crags lie about a mile and a half beyond Mr.
Heathcliff's place, and that is four from the Grange, so I began to fear
night would fall ere I could reach them. <div class="bookquote">``And what if she (<font color='blue'><b>Ellen</b></font>) should have
slipped in clambering among them,''  (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div>I reflected, `and been killed, or
broken some of her (<font color='blue'><b>Catherine</b></font>) bones?'' My suspense was truly painful; and, at first,
it gave me delightful relief to observe, in hurrying by the farmhouse,
Charlie, the fiercest of the pointers, lying under a window, with swelled
head and bleeding ear. I opened the wicket and ran to the door, knocking
vehemently for admittance. A woman whom I knew, and who formerly lived
at Gimmerton, answered: she (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) had been servant there since the death of Mr.
Earnshaw.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Ah,''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>said she (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>), `you are come a-seeking your little mistress! Don't be
frightened. She (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>)'s here safe: but I'm glad it isn't the master.''

<p/><div class="bookquote">``He (<font color='blue'><b>my</b></font>) is not at home then, is he (<font color='blue'><b>my</b></font>)?''  (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div>I panted, quite breathless with quick
walking and alarm.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``No, no,''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) replied: `both he (<font color='blue'><b>master</b></font>) and Joseph are off, and I think they
won't return this hour or more. Step in and rest you a bit.''

<p/>I entered, and beheld my stray lamb seated on the hearth, rocking herself
in a little chair that had been her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) mother's when a child. Her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) hat was
hung against the wall, and she (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) seemed perfectly at home, laughing and
chattering, in the best spirits imaginable, to Hareton--now a great,
strong lad of eighteen--who stared at her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) with considerable curiosity and
astonishment: comprehending precious little of the fluent succession of
remarks and questions which her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) tongue never ceased pouring forth.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Very well, Miss!''  (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div>I exclaimed, concealing my joy under an angry
countenance. <div class="bookquote">``This is your last ride, till papa comes back. I'll not
trust you over the threshold again, you naughty, naughty girl!''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Aha, Ellen!''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) cried, gaily, jumping up and running to my side. <div class="bookquote">``I
shall have a pretty story to tell to-night; and so you've found me out.
Have you ever been here in your life before?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Put that hat on, and home at once,''  (<font color='red'><b>I.</b></font>)</div>said I. <div class="bookquote">``I'm dreadfully grieved at
you, Miss Cathy: you've done extremely wrong! It's no use pouting and
crying: that won't repay the trouble I've had, scouring the country after
you. To think how Mr. Linton charged me to keep you in; and you stealing
off so! It shows you are a cunning little fox, and nobody will put faith
in you any more.''

 (<font color='red'><b>I.</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``What have I done?''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>sobbed she (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>), instantly checked. <div class="bookquote">``Papa charged me
nothing: he (<font color='blue'><b>Papa</b></font>)'ll not scold me, Ellen--he (<font color='blue'><b>Papa</b></font>)'s never cross, like you!''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Come, come!''  (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div>I repeated. <div class="bookquote">``I'll tie the riband. Now, let us have no
petulance. Oh, for shame! You thirteen years old, and such a baby!''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/>This exclamation was caused by her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) pushing the hat from her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) head, and
retreating to the chimney out of my reach.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Nay,''  (<font color='red'><b>the servant Dean</b></font>)</div>said the servant, `don't be hard on the bonny lass, Mrs. Dean. We
made her (<font color='blue'><b>Dean</b></font>) stop: she (<font color='blue'><b>Dean</b></font>)'d fain have ridden forwards, afeard you should be
uneasy. Hareton offered to go with her (<font color='blue'><b>Dean</b></font>), and I thought he (<font color='blue'><b>Hareton</b></font>) should: it's a
wild road over the hills.''

<p/>Hareton, during the discussion, stood with his (<font color='blue'><b>Hareton</b></font>) hands in his (<font color='blue'><b>Hareton</b></font>) pockets, too
awkward to speak; though he (<font color='blue'><b>Hareton</b></font>) looked as if he (<font color='blue'><b>Hareton</b></font>) did not relish my intrusion.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``How long am I to wait?''  (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div>I continued, disregarding the woman's
interference. <div class="bookquote">``It will be dark in ten minutes. Where is the pony, Miss
Cathy? And where is Phoenix? I shall leave you, unless you be quick; so
please yourself.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``The pony is in the yard,''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) replied, `and Phoenix is shut in there.
He (<font color='blue'><b>Hareton</b></font>)'s bitten--and so is Charlie. I was going to tell you all about it;
but you are in a bad temper, and don't deserve to hear.''

<p/>I picked up her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) hat, and approached to reinstate it; but perceiving that
the people of the house took her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) part, she (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) commenced capering round the
room; and on my giving chase, ran like a mouse over and under and behind
the furniture, rendering it ridiculous for me to pursue. Hareton and the
woman laughed, and she (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) joined them, and waxed more impertinent still;
till I cried, in great irritation,--<div class="bookquote">``Well, Miss Cathy, if you were aware
whose house this is you'd be glad enough to get out.''

 (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``It's _your_ father's, isn't it?''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>said she (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>), turning to Hareton.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Nay,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Hareton</b></font>) replied, looking down, and blushing bashfully.

<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Hareton</b></font>) could not stand a steady gaze from her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) eyes, though they were just his (<font color='blue'><b>Hareton</b></font>)
own.

<p/>``Whose then--your master<div class="bookquote">``s?''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) asked.

<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Hareton</b></font>) coloured deeper, with a different feeling, muttered an oath, and
turned away.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Who is his (<font color='blue'><b>master</b></font>) master?''  (<font color='red'><b>the girl</b></font>)</div>continued the tiresome girl, appealing to me. ``He (<font color='blue'><b>master</b></font>)
talked about ``our house,'' and ``our folk.<div class="bookquote">'' I thought he (<font color='blue'><b>Hareton</b></font>) had been the
owner's son. And he (<font color='blue'><b>Hareton</b></font>) never said Miss: he (<font color='blue'><b>Hareton</b></font>) should have done, shouldn't he (<font color='blue'><b>Hareton</b></font>),
if he (<font color='blue'><b>Hareton</b></font>)'s a servant?''

 (<font color='red'><b>folk</b></font>)</div><p/>Hareton grew black as a thunder-cloud at this childish speech. I
silently shook my questioner, and at last succeeded in equipping her (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) for
departure.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Now, get my horse,''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) said, addressing her (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) unknown kinsman as she (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>)
would one of the stable-boys at the Grange. <div class="bookquote">``And you may come with me. I
want to see where the goblin-hunter rises in the marsh, and to hear about
the _fairishes_, as you call them: but make haste! What's the matter?
Get my horse, I say.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I'll see thee damned before I be _thy_ servant!''  (<font color='red'><b>the lad</b></font>)</div>growled the lad.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``You'll see me _what_!''  (<font color='red'><b>Catherine/Earnshaw/Catherine Earnshaw</b></font>)</div>asked Catherine in surprise.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Damned--thou saucy witch!''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>lad</b></font>) replied.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``There, Miss Cathy! you see you have got into pretty company,''  (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div>I
interposed. <div class="bookquote">``Nice words to be used to a young lady! Pray don't begin to
dispute with him (<font color='blue'><b>servant</b></font>). Come, let us seek for Minny ourselves, and begone.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``But, Ellen,''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>cried she (<font color='blue'><b>Catherine</b></font>), staring fixed in astonishment, `how dare he (<font color='blue'><b>lad</b></font>)
speak so to me? Mustn't he (<font color='blue'><b>lad</b></font>) be made to do as I ask him (<font color='blue'><b>lad</b></font>)? You wicked
creature, I shall tell papa what you said.--Now, then!''

<p/>Hareton did not appear to feel this threat; so the tears sprang into her (<font color='blue'><b>Catherine</b></font>)
eyes with indignation. <div class="bookquote">``You bring the pony,''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Catherine</b></font>) exclaimed, turning to
the woman, `and let my dog free this moment!''

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Softly, Miss,''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>answered she (<font color='blue'><b>Catherine</b></font>) addressed; `you'll lose nothing by being
civil. Though Mr. Hareton, there, be not the master's son, he (<font color='blue'><b>Hareton</b></font>)'s your
cousin: and I was never hired to serve you.''

<p/>'_He (<font color='blue'><b>Hareton</b></font>)_ my cousin!'' cried Cathy, with a scornful laugh.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Yes, indeed,''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>responded her (<font color='blue'><b>Cathy</b></font>) reprover.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Oh, Ellen! don't let them say such things,''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Cathy</b></font>) pursued in great
trouble. ``Papa is gone to fetch my cousin from London: my cousin is a
gentleman's son. That my--' she (<font color='blue'><b>Ellen</b></font>) stopped, and wept outright; upset at the
bare notion of relationship with such a clown.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Hush, hush!''  (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div>I whispered; `people can have many cousins and of all
sorts, Miss Cathy, without being any the worse for it; only they needn't
keep their company, if they be disagreeable and bad.''

<p/><div class="bookquote">``He (<font color='blue'><b>clown</b></font>)'s not--he (<font color='blue'><b>clown</b></font>)'s not my cousin, Ellen!''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Cathy</b></font>) went on, gathering fresh grief
from reflection, and flinging herself into my arms for refuge from the
idea.

<p/>I was much vexed at her (<font color='blue'><b>Cathy</b></font>) and the servant for their mutual revelations;
having no doubt of Linton's approaching arrival, communicated by the
former, being reported to Mr. Heathcliff; and feeling as confident that
Catherine's first thought on her (<font color='blue'><b>Catherine</b></font>) father's return would be to seek an
explanation of the latter's assertion concerning her (<font color='blue'><b>Catherine</b></font>) rude-bred kindred.
Hareton, recovering from his (<font color='blue'><b>Hareton</b></font>) disgust at being taken for a servant, seemed
moved by her (<font color='blue'><b>Catherine</b></font>) distress; and, having fetched the pony round to the door, he (<font color='blue'><b>Hareton</b></font>)
took, to propitiate her (<font color='blue'><b>Catherine</b></font>), a fine crooked-legged terrier whelp from the
kennel, and putting it into her (<font color='blue'><b>Catherine</b></font>) hand, bid her (<font color='blue'><b>Catherine</b></font>) whist! for he (<font color='blue'><b>Hareton</b></font>) meant nought.
Pausing in her (<font color='blue'><b>Catherine</b></font>) lamentations, she (<font color='blue'><b>Catherine</b></font>) surveyed him (<font color='blue'><b>Hareton</b></font>) with a glance of awe and
horror, then burst forth anew.

<p/>I could scarcely refrain from smiling at this antipathy to the poor
fellow; who was a well-made, athletic youth, good-looking in features,
and stout and healthy, but attired in garments befitting his (<font color='blue'><b>fellow</b></font>) daily
occupations of working on the farm and lounging among the moors after
rabbits and game. Still, I thought I could detect in his (<font color='blue'><b>fellow</b></font>) physiognomy a
mind owning better qualities than his (<font color='blue'><b>fellow</b></font>) father ever possessed. Good things
lost amid a wilderness of weeds, to be sure, whose rankness far
over-topped their neglected growth; yet, notwithstanding, evidence of a
wealthy soil, that might yield luxuriant crops under other and favourable
circumstances. Mr. Heathcliff, I believe, had not treated him (<font color='blue'><b>Heathcliff</b></font>) physically
ill; thanks to his (<font color='blue'><b>Heathcliff</b></font>) fearless nature, which offered no temptation to that
course of oppression: he (<font color='blue'><b>Heathcliff</b></font>) had none of the timid susceptibility that would
have given zest to ill-treatment, in Heathcliff's judgment. He (<font color='blue'><b>Heathcliff</b></font>) appeared
to have bent his (<font color='blue'><b>Heathcliff</b></font>) malevolence on making him (<font color='blue'><b>Heathcliff</b></font>) a brute: he (<font color='blue'><b>Heathcliff</b></font>) was never taught
to read or write; never rebuked for any bad habit which did not annoy his (<font color='blue'><b>Heathcliff</b></font>)
keeper; never led a single step towards virtue, or guarded by a single
precept against vice. And from what I heard, Joseph contributed much to
his (<font color='blue'><b>Joseph</b></font>) deterioration, by a narrow-minded partiality which prompted him (<font color='blue'><b>Joseph</b></font>) to
flatter and pet him (<font color='blue'><b>Joseph</b></font>), as a boy, because he (<font color='blue'><b>Joseph</b></font>) was the head of the old family.
And as he (<font color='blue'><b>Joseph</b></font>) had been in the habit of accusing Catherine Earnshaw and
Heathcliff, when children, of putting the master past his (<font color='blue'><b>Heathcliff</b></font>) patience, and
compelling him (<font color='blue'><b>Heathcliff</b></font>) to seek solace in drink by what he (<font color='blue'><b>Heathcliff</b></font>) termed their `offald
ways,'' so at present he (<font color='blue'><b>Heathcliff</b></font>) laid the whole burden of Hareton's faults on the
shoulders of the usurper of his (<font color='blue'><b>Hareton</b></font>) property. If the lad swore, he (<font color='blue'><b>lad</b></font>) wouldn't
correct him (<font color='blue'><b>lad</b></font>): nor however culpably he (<font color='blue'><b>lad</b></font>) behaved. It gave Joseph
satisfaction, apparently, to watch him (<font color='blue'><b>Joseph</b></font>) go the worst lengths: he (<font color='blue'><b>Joseph</b></font>) allowed
that the lad was ruined: that his (<font color='blue'><b>lad</b></font>) soul was abandoned to perdition; but
then he (<font color='blue'><b>lad</b></font>) reflected that Heathcliff must answer for it. Hareton's blood
would be required at his (<font color='blue'><b>Heathcliff</b></font>) hands; and there lay immense consolation in that
thought. Joseph had instilled into him (<font color='blue'><b>Joseph</b></font>) a pride of name, and of his (<font color='blue'><b>Joseph</b></font>)
lineage; he (<font color='blue'><b>Joseph</b></font>) would, had he (<font color='blue'><b>Joseph</b></font>) dared, have fostered hate between him (<font color='blue'><b>Joseph</b></font>) and the
present owner of the Heights: but his (<font color='blue'><b>Joseph</b></font>) dread of that owner amounted to
superstition; and he (<font color='blue'><b>Joseph</b></font>) confined his (<font color='blue'><b>Joseph</b></font>) feelings regarding him (<font color='blue'><b>Joseph</b></font>) to muttered
innuendoes and private comminations. I don't pretend to be intimately
acquainted with the mode of living customary in those days at Wuthering
Heights: I only speak from hearsay; for I saw little. The villagers
affirmed Mr. Heathcliff was _near_, and a cruel hard landlord to his (<font color='blue'><b>Heathcliff</b></font>)
tenants; but the house, inside, had regained its ancient aspect of
comfort under female management, and the scenes of riot common in
Hindley's time were not now enacted within its walls. The master was too
gloomy to seek companionship with any people, good or bad; and he (<font color='blue'><b>master</b></font>) is yet.

<p/>This, however, is not making progress with my story. Miss Cathy rejected
the peace-offering of the terrier, and demanded her (<font color='blue'><b>Cathy</b></font>) own dogs, Charlie and
Phoenix. They came limping and hanging their heads; and we set out for
home, sadly out of sorts, every one of us. I could not wring from my
little lady how she (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) had spent the day; except that, as I supposed, the
goal of her (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) pilgrimage was Penistone Crags; and she (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) arrived without
adventure to the gate of the farm-house, when Hareton happened to issue
forth, attended by some canine followers, who attacked her (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) train. They
had a smart battle, before their owners could separate them: that formed
an introduction. Catherine told Hareton who she (<font color='blue'><b>Catherine</b></font>) was, and where she (<font color='blue'><b>Catherine</b></font>) was
going; and asked him (<font color='blue'><b>Hareton</b></font>) to show her (<font color='blue'><b>Catherine</b></font>) the way: finally, beguiling him (<font color='blue'><b>Hareton</b></font>) to
accompany her (<font color='blue'><b>Catherine</b></font>). He (<font color='blue'><b>Hareton</b></font>) opened the mysteries of the Fairy Cave, and twenty
other queer places. But, being in disgrace, I was not favoured with a
description of the interesting objects she (<font color='blue'><b>Fairy</b></font>) saw. I could gather, however,
that her (<font color='blue'><b>Fairy</b></font>) guide had been a favourite till she (<font color='blue'><b>Fairy</b></font>) hurt his (<font color='blue'><b>Hareton</b></font>) feelings by
addressing him (<font color='blue'><b>Hareton</b></font>) as a servant; and Heathcliff's housekeeper hurt hers by
calling him (<font color='blue'><b>Heathcliff</b></font>) her (<font color='blue'><b>housekeeper</b></font>) cousin. Then the language he (<font color='blue'><b>Heathcliff</b></font>) had held to her (<font color='blue'><b>housekeeper</b></font>) rankled in
her (<font color='blue'><b>housekeeper</b></font>) heart; she (<font color='blue'><b>housekeeper</b></font>) who was always <div class="bookquote">``love,''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>and <div class="bookquote">``darling,''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>and <div class="bookquote">``queen,''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>and
<div class="bookquote">``angel,''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>with everybody at the Grange, to be insulted so shockingly by a
stranger! She (<font color='blue'><b>housekeeper</b></font>) did not comprehend it; and hard work I had to obtain a
promise that she (<font color='blue'><b>housekeeper</b></font>) would not lay the grievance before her (<font color='blue'><b>housekeeper</b></font>) father. I
explained how he (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) objected to the whole household at the Heights, and how
sorry he (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) would be to find she (<font color='blue'><b>housekeeper</b></font>) had been there; but I insisted most on the
fact, that if she (<font color='blue'><b>housekeeper</b></font>) revealed my negligence of his (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) orders, he (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) would perhaps
be so angry that I should have to leave; and Cathy couldn't bear that
prospect: she (<font color='blue'><b>Cathy</b></font>) pledged her (<font color='blue'><b>Cathy</b></font>) word, and kept it for my sake. After all, she (<font color='blue'><b>Cathy</b></font>)
was a sweet little girl.




<p/>CHAPTER XIX


<p/>A letter, edged with black, announced the day of my master's return.
Isabella was dead; and he (<font color='blue'><b>master</b></font>) wrote to bid me get mourning for his (<font color='blue'><b>master</b></font>) daughter,
and arrange a room, and other accommodations, for his (<font color='blue'><b>master</b></font>) youthful nephew.
Catherine ran wild with joy at the idea of welcoming her (<font color='blue'><b>Catherine</b></font>) father back; and
indulged most sanguine anticipations of the innumerable excellencies of
her (<font color='blue'><b>Catherine</b></font>) `real' cousin. The evening of their expected arrival came. Since
early morning she (<font color='blue'><b>Catherine</b></font>) had been busy ordering her (<font color='blue'><b>Catherine</b></font>) own small affairs; and now
attired in her (<font color='blue'><b>Catherine</b></font>) new black frock--poor thing! her (<font color='blue'><b>Catherine</b></font>) aunt's death impressed
her (<font color='blue'><b>Catherine</b></font>) with no definite sorrow--she (<font color='blue'><b>Catherine</b></font>) obliged me, by constant worrying, to
walk with her (<font color='blue'><b>Catherine</b></font>) down through the grounds to meet them.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Linton is just six months younger than I am,''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Catherine</b></font>) chattered, as we
strolled leisurely over the swells and hollows of mossy turf, under
shadow of the trees. <div class="bookquote">``How delightful it will be to have him (<font color='blue'><b>angel</b></font>) for a
playfellow! Aunt Isabella sent papa a beautiful lock of his (<font color='blue'><b>papa</b></font>) hair; it was
lighter than mine--more flaxen, and quite as fine. I have it carefully
preserved in a little glass box; and I've often thought what a pleasure
it would be to see its owner. Oh! I am happy--and papa, dear, dear papa!
Come, Ellen, let us run! come, run.''

 (<font color='red'><b>She</b></font>)</div><p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>Catherine</b></font>) ran, and returned and ran again, many times before my sober footsteps
reached the gate, and then she (<font color='blue'><b>Catherine</b></font>) seated herself on the grassy bank beside
the path, and tried to wait patiently; but that was impossible: she (<font color='blue'><b>Catherine</b></font>)
couldn't be still a minute.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``How long they are!''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Catherine</b></font>) exclaimed. <div class="bookquote">``Ah, I see, some dust on the
road--they are coming! No! When will they be here? May we not go a
little way--half a mile, Ellen, only just half a mile? Do say Yes: to
that clump of birches at the turn!''

 (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div><p/>I refused staunchly. At length her (<font color='blue'><b>Catherine</b></font>) suspense was ended: the travelling
carriage rolled in sight. Miss Cathy shrieked and stretched out her (<font color='blue'><b>Cathy</b></font>) arms
as soon as she (<font color='blue'><b>Cathy</b></font>) caught her (<font color='blue'><b>Cathy</b></font>) father's face looking from the window. He (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>)
descended, nearly as eager as herself; and a considerable interval
elapsed ere they had a thought to spare for any but themselves. While
they exchanged caresses I took a peep in to see after Linton. He (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) was
asleep in a corner, wrapped in a warm, fur-lined cloak, as if it had been
winter. A pale, delicate, effeminate boy, who might have been taken for
my master's younger brother, so strong was the resemblance: but there was
a sickly peevishness in his (<font color='blue'><b>brother</b></font>) aspect that Edgar Linton never had. The
latter saw me looking; and having shaken hands, advised me to close the
door, and leave him (<font color='blue'><b>Linton</b></font>) undisturbed; for the journey had fatigued him (<font color='blue'><b>Linton</b></font>). Cathy
would fain have taken one glance, but her (<font color='blue'><b>Cathy</b></font>) father told her (<font color='blue'><b>Cathy</b></font>) to come, and
they walked together up the park, while I hastened before to prepare the
servants.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Now, darling,''  (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Linton</b></font>)</div>said Mr. Linton, addressing his (<font color='blue'><b>Linton</b></font>) daughter, as they halted
at the bottom of the front steps: `your cousin is not so strong or so
merry as you are, and he (<font color='blue'><b>cousin</b></font>) has lost his (<font color='blue'><b>cousin</b></font>) mother, remember, a very short time
since; therefore, don't expect him (<font color='blue'><b>cousin</b></font>) to play and run about with you
directly. And don't harass him (<font color='blue'><b>cousin</b></font>) much by talking: let him (<font color='blue'><b>cousin</b></font>) be quiet this
evening, at least, will you?''

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Yes, yes, papa,''  (<font color='red'><b>Catherine/Earnshaw/Catherine Earnshaw</b></font>)</div>answered Catherine: `but I do want to see him (<font color='blue'><b>cousin</b></font>); and he (<font color='blue'><b>cousin</b></font>)
hasn't once looked out.''

<p/>The carriage stopped; and the sleeper being roused, was lifted to the
ground by his (<font color='blue'><b>cousin</b></font>) uncle.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``This is your cousin Cathy, Linton,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>cousin</b></font>) said, putting their little hands
together. <div class="bookquote">``She (<font color='blue'><b>Cathy</b></font>)'s fond of you already; and mind you don't grieve her (<font color='blue'><b>Cathy</b></font>) by
crying to-night. Try to be cheerful now; the travelling is at an end,
and you have nothing to do but rest and amuse yourself as you please.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Let me go to bed, then,''  (<font color='red'><b>the boy</b></font>)</div>answered the boy, shrinking from Catherine's
salute; and he (<font color='blue'><b>cousin</b></font>) put his (<font color='blue'><b>cousin</b></font>) fingers to remove incipient tears.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Come, come, there's a good child,''  (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div>I whispered, leading him (<font color='blue'><b>cousin</b></font>) in. <div class="bookquote">``You'll
make her (<font color='blue'><b>Cathy</b></font>) weep too--see how sorry she (<font color='blue'><b>Cathy</b></font>) is for you!''

 (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div><p/>I do not know whether it was sorrow for him (<font color='blue'><b>cousin</b></font>), but his (<font color='blue'><b>cousin</b></font>) cousin put on as sad
a countenance as himself, and returned to her (<font color='blue'><b>Catherine</b></font>) father. All three entered,
and mounted to the library, where tea was laid ready. I proceeded to
remove Linton's cap and mantle, and placed him (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) on a chair by the table;
but he (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) was no sooner seated than he (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) began to cry afresh. My master
inquired what was the matter.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``I can't sit on a chair,''  (<font color='red'><b>the boy</b></font>)</div>sobbed the boy.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Go to the sofa, then, and Ellen shall bring you some tea,''  (<font color='red'><b>uncle</b></font>)</div>answered his (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>)
uncle patiently.

<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>) had been greatly tried, during the journey, I felt convinced, by his (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>)
fretful ailing charge. Linton slowly trailed himself off, and lay down.
Cathy carried a footstool and her (<font color='blue'><b>Cathy</b></font>) cup to his (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>) side. At first she (<font color='blue'><b>Cathy</b></font>) sat
silent; but that could not last: she (<font color='blue'><b>Cathy</b></font>) had resolved to make a pet of her (<font color='blue'><b>Cathy</b></font>)
little cousin, as she (<font color='blue'><b>Cathy</b></font>) would have him (<font color='blue'><b>cousin</b></font>) to be; and she (<font color='blue'><b>Cathy</b></font>) commenced stroking
his (<font color='blue'><b>cousin</b></font>) curls, and kissing his (<font color='blue'><b>cousin</b></font>) cheek, and offering him (<font color='blue'><b>cousin</b></font>) tea in her (<font color='blue'><b>Cathy</b></font>) saucer,
like a baby. This pleased him (<font color='blue'><b>cousin</b></font>), for he (<font color='blue'><b>cousin</b></font>) was not much better: he (<font color='blue'><b>cousin</b></font>) dried his (<font color='blue'><b>cousin</b></font>)
eyes, and lightened into a faint smile.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Oh, he (<font color='blue'><b>you</b></font>)'ll do very well,''  (<font color='red'><b>the master</b></font>)</div>said the master to me, after watching them a
minute. <div class="bookquote">``Very well, if we can keep him (<font color='blue'><b>you</b></font>), Ellen. The company of a child
of his (<font color='blue'><b>you</b></font>) own age will instil new spirit into him (<font color='blue'><b>you</b></font>) soon, and by wishing for
strength he (<font color='blue'><b>you</b></font>)'ll gain it.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Ay, if we can keep him (<font color='blue'><b>you</b></font>)!''  (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div>I mused to myself; and sore misgivings came
over me that there was slight hope of that. And then, I thought, how
ever will that weakling live at Wuthering Heights? Between his (<font color='blue'><b>master</b></font>) father
and Hareton, what playmates and instructors they'll be. Our doubts were
presently decided--even earlier than I expected. I had just taken the
children up-stairs, after tea was finished, and seen Linton asleep--he (<font color='blue'><b>master</b></font>)
would not suffer me to leave him (<font color='blue'><b>master</b></font>) till that was the case--I had come down,
and was standing by the table in the hall, lighting a bedroom candle for
Mr. Edgar, when a maid stepped out of the kitchen and informed me that
Mr. Heathcliff's servant Joseph was at the door, and wished to speak with
the master.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``I shall ask him (<font color='blue'><b>you</b></font>) what he (<font color='blue'><b>you</b></font>) wants first,''  (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div>I said, in considerable
trepidation. <div class="bookquote">``A very unlikely hour to be troubling people, and the
instant they have returned from a long journey. I don't think the master
can see him (<font color='blue'><b>master</b></font>).''

 (<font color='red'><b>Joseph</b></font>)</div><p/>Joseph had advanced through the kitchen as I uttered these words, and now
presented himself in the hall. He (<font color='blue'><b>Joseph</b></font>) was donned in his (<font color='blue'><b>Joseph</b></font>) Sunday garments,
with his (<font color='blue'><b>Joseph</b></font>) most sanctimonious and sourest face, and, holding his (<font color='blue'><b>Joseph</b></font>) hat in one
hand, and his (<font color='blue'><b>Joseph</b></font>) stick in the other, he (<font color='blue'><b>Joseph</b></font>) proceeded to clean his (<font color='blue'><b>Joseph</b></font>) shoes on the
mat.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Good-evening, Joseph,''  (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div>I said, coldly. <div class="bookquote">``What business brings you here
to-night?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``It's Maister Linton I mun spake to,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Joseph</b></font>) answered, waving me disdainfully
aside.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Mr. Linton is going to bed; unless you have something particular to say,
I'm sure he (<font color='blue'><b>Linton</b></font>) won't hear it now,''  (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div>I continued. <div class="bookquote">``You had better sit down in
there, and entrust your message to me.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Which is his (<font color='blue'><b>Linton</b></font>) rahm?''  (<font color='red'><b>the fellow</b></font>)</div>pursued the fellow, surveying the range of closed
doors.

<p/>I perceived he (<font color='blue'><b>Joseph</b></font>) was bent on refusing my mediation, so very reluctantly I
went up to the library, and announced the unseasonable visitor, advising
that he (<font color='blue'><b>visitor</b></font>) should be dismissed till next day. Mr. Linton had no time to
empower me to do so, for Joseph mounted close at my heels, and, pushing
into the apartment, planted himself at the far side of the table, with
his (<font color='blue'><b>Joseph</b></font>) two fists clapped on the head of his (<font color='blue'><b>Joseph</b></font>) stick, and began in an elevated
tone, as if anticipating opposition--

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Hathecliff has sent me for his (<font color='blue'><b>Linton</b></font>) lad, and I munn't goa back `bout him (<font color='blue'><b>Linton</b></font>).''

 (<font color='red'><b>Joseph</b></font>)</div><p/>Edgar Linton was silent a minute; an expression of exceeding sorrow
overcast his (<font color='blue'><b>Linton</b></font>) features: he (<font color='blue'><b>Linton</b></font>) would have pitied the child on his (<font color='blue'><b>Linton</b></font>) own account;
but, recalling Isabella's hopes and fears, and anxious wishes for her (<font color='blue'><b>Isabella</b></font>)
son, and her (<font color='blue'><b>Isabella</b></font>) commendations of him (<font color='blue'><b>son</b></font>) to his (<font color='blue'><b>son</b></font>) care, he (<font color='blue'><b>son</b></font>) grieved bitterly at the
prospect of yielding him (<font color='blue'><b>son</b></font>) up, and searched in his (<font color='blue'><b>son</b></font>) heart how it might be
avoided. No plan offered itself: the very exhibition of any desire to
keep him (<font color='blue'><b>son</b></font>) would have rendered the claimant more peremptory: there was
nothing left but to resign him (<font color='blue'><b>son</b></font>). However, he (<font color='blue'><b>son</b></font>) was not going to rouse him (<font color='blue'><b>son</b></font>)
from his (<font color='blue'><b>son</b></font>) sleep.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Tell Mr. Heathcliff,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>son</b></font>) answered calmly, `that his (<font color='blue'><b>son</b></font>) son shall come to
Wuthering Heights to-morrow. He (<font color='blue'><b>son</b></font>) is in bed, and too tired to go the
distance now. You may also tell him (<font color='blue'><b>son</b></font>) that the mother of Linton desired
him (<font color='blue'><b>son</b></font>) to remain under my guardianship; and, at present, his (<font color='blue'><b>son</b></font>) health is very
precarious.''

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Noa!''  (<font color='red'><b>Joseph</b></font>)</div>said Joseph, giving a thud with his (<font color='blue'><b>Joseph</b></font>) prop on the floor, and
assuming an authoritative air. <div class="bookquote">``Noa! that means naught. Hathecliff maks
noa `count o' t' mother, nor ye norther; but he (<font color='blue'><b>Noa</b></font>)'ll heu' his (<font color='blue'><b>Noa</b></font>) lad; und I
mun tak' him (<font color='blue'><b>Noa</b></font>)--soa now ye knaw!''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``You shall not to-night!''  (<font color='red'><b>Linton/Mrs. Linton/Mrs. Heathcliff</b></font>)</div>answered Linton decisively. ``Walk down stairs
at once, and repeat to your master what I have said. Ellen, show him (<font color='blue'><b>master</b></font>)
down. Go--'

<p/>And, aiding the indignant elder with a lift by the arm, he (<font color='blue'><b>master</b></font>) rid the room
of him (<font color='blue'><b>master</b></font>) and closed the door.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Varrah weell!''  (<font color='red'><b>Joseph</b></font>)</div>shouted Joseph, as he (<font color='blue'><b>Joseph</b></font>) slowly drew off. <div class="bookquote">``To-morn, he (<font color='blue'><b>master</b></font>)'s
come hisseln, and thrust _him (<font color='blue'><b>master</b></font>)_ out, if ye darr!''




 (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Linton</b></font>)</div><p/>CHAPTER XX


<p/>To obviate the danger of this threat being fulfilled, Mr. Linton
commissioned me to take the boy home early, on Catherine's pony; and,
said he (<font color='blue'><b>Linton</b></font>)--<div class="bookquote">``As we shall now have no influence over his (<font color='blue'><b>master</b></font>) destiny, good or
bad, you must say nothing of where he (<font color='blue'><b>master</b></font>) is gone to my daughter: she (<font color='blue'><b>daughter</b></font>) cannot
associate with him (<font color='blue'><b>master</b></font>) hereafter, and it is better for her (<font color='blue'><b>daughter</b></font>) to remain in
ignorance of his (<font color='blue'><b>master</b></font>) proximity; lest she (<font color='blue'><b>daughter</b></font>) should be restless, and anxious to
visit the Heights. Merely tell her (<font color='blue'><b>daughter</b></font>) his (<font color='blue'><b>master</b></font>) father sent for him (<font color='blue'><b>master</b></font>) suddenly, and
he (<font color='blue'><b>master</b></font>) has been obliged to leave us.''

 (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div><p/>Linton was very reluctant to be roused from his (<font color='blue'><b>Linton</b></font>) bed at five o'clock, and
astonished to be informed that he (<font color='blue'><b>Linton</b></font>) must prepare for further travelling;
but I softened off the matter by stating that he (<font color='blue'><b>Linton</b></font>) was going to spend some
time with his (<font color='blue'><b>Linton</b></font>) father, Mr. Heathcliff, who wished to see him (<font color='blue'><b>Linton</b></font>) so much, he (<font color='blue'><b>Linton</b></font>)
did not like to defer the pleasure till he (<font color='blue'><b>Linton</b></font>) should recover from his (<font color='blue'><b>Linton</b></font>) late
journey.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``My father!''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Linton</b></font>) cried, in strange perplexity. <div class="bookquote">``Mamma never told me I had
a father. Where does he (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) live? I'd rather stay with uncle.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``He (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) lives a little distance from the Grange,''  (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div>I replied; `just beyond
those hills: not so far, but you may walk over here when you get hearty.
And you should be glad to go home, and to see him (<font color='blue'><b>Linton</b></font>). You must try to love
him (<font color='blue'><b>Linton</b></font>), as you did your mother, and then he (<font color='blue'><b>Linton</b></font>) will love you.''

<p/><div class="bookquote">``But why have I not heard of him (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) before?''  (<font color='red'><b>Linton/Mrs. Linton/Mrs. Heathcliff</b></font>)</div>asked Linton. <div class="bookquote">``Why didn't
mamma and he (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) live together, as other people do?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``He (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) had business to keep him (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) in the north,''  (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div>I answered, `and your
mother's health required her (<font color='blue'><b>Linton</b></font>) to reside in the south.''

<p/><div class="bookquote">``And why didn't mamma speak to me about him (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>)?''  (<font color='red'><b>the child</b></font>)</div>persevered the child. <div class="bookquote">``She (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>)
often talked of uncle, and I learnt to love him (<font color='blue'><b>uncle</b></font>) long ago. How am I to
love papa? I don't know him (<font color='blue'><b>papa</b></font>).''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Oh, all children love their parents,''  (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div>I said. <div class="bookquote">``Your mother, perhaps,
thought you would want to be with him (<font color='blue'><b>papa</b></font>) if she (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) mentioned him (<font color='blue'><b>papa</b></font>) often to you.
Let us make haste. An early ride on such a beautiful morning is much
preferable to an hour's more sleep.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Is _she (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>)_ to go with us,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Linton</b></font>) demanded, `the little girl I saw yesterday?''

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Not now,''  (<font color='red'><b>I.</b></font>)</div>replied I.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Is uncle?''  (<font color='red'><b>I.</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Linton</b></font>) continued.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``No, I shall be your companion there,''  (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div>I said.

<p/>Linton sank back on his (<font color='blue'><b>Linton</b></font>) pillow and fell into a brown study.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``I won't go without uncle,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Linton</b></font>) cried at length: <div class="bookquote">``I can't tell where you
mean to take me.''

 (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div><p/>I attempted to persuade him (<font color='blue'><b>Linton</b></font>) of the naughtiness of showing reluctance to
meet his (<font color='blue'><b>Linton</b></font>) father; still he (<font color='blue'><b>Linton</b></font>) obstinately resisted any progress towards
dressing, and I had to call for my master's assistance in coaxing him (<font color='blue'><b>master</b></font>) out
of bed. The poor thing was finally got off, with several delusive
assurances that his (<font color='blue'><b>master</b></font>) absence should be short: that Mr. Edgar and Cathy
would visit him (<font color='blue'><b>Edgar</b></font>), and other promises, equally ill-founded, which I
invented and reiterated at intervals throughout the way. The pure
heather-scented air, the bright sunshine, and the gentle canter of Minny,
relieved his (<font color='blue'><b>Edgar</b></font>) despondency after a while. He (<font color='blue'><b>Edgar</b></font>) began to put questions
concerning his (<font color='blue'><b>Edgar</b></font>) new home, and its inhabitants, with greater interest and
liveliness.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Is Wuthering Heights as pleasant a place as Thrushcross Grange?''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Edgar</b></font>)
inquired, turning to take a last glance into the valley, whence a light
mist mounted and formed a fleecy cloud on the skirts of the blue.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``It is not so buried in trees,''  (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div>I replied, `and it is not quite so large,
but you can see the country beautifully all round; and the air is
healthier for you--fresher and drier. You will, perhaps, think the
building old and dark at first; though it is a respectable house: the
next best in the neighbourhood. And you will have such nice rambles on
the moors. Hareton Earnshaw--that is, Miss Cathy's other cousin, and so
yours in a manner--will show you all the sweetest spots; and you can
bring a book in fine weather, and make a green hollow your study; and,
now and then, your uncle may join you in a walk: he (<font color='blue'><b>uncle</b></font>) does, frequently,
walk out on the hills.''

<p/><div class="bookquote">``And what is my father like?''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>uncle</b></font>) asked. <div class="bookquote">``Is he (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) as young and handsome as
uncle?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``He (<font color='blue'><b>uncle</b></font>)'s as young,''  (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div>said I; `but he (<font color='blue'><b>uncle</b></font>) has black hair and eyes, and looks
sterner; and he (<font color='blue'><b>uncle</b></font>) is taller and bigger altogether. He (<font color='blue'><b>uncle</b></font>)'ll not seem to you
so gentle and kind at first, perhaps, because it is not his (<font color='blue'><b>uncle</b></font>) way: still,
mind you, be frank and cordial with him (<font color='blue'><b>uncle</b></font>); and naturally he (<font color='blue'><b>uncle</b></font>)'ll be fonder of
you than any uncle, for you are his (<font color='blue'><b>uncle</b></font>) own.''

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Black hair and eyes!''  (<font color='red'><b>Linton/Mrs. Linton/Mrs. Heathcliff</b></font>)</div>mused Linton. <div class="bookquote">``I can't fancy him (<font color='blue'><b>uncle</b></font>). Then I am not
like him (<font color='blue'><b>uncle</b></font>), am I?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Not much,''  (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div>I answered: not a morsel, I thought, surveying with regret
the white complexion and slim frame of my companion, and his (<font color='blue'><b>companion</b></font>) large
languid eyes--his (<font color='blue'><b>companion</b></font>) mother's eyes, save that, unless a morbid touchiness
kindled them a moment, they had not a vestige of her (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) sparkling spirit.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``How strange that he (<font color='blue'><b>uncle</b></font>) should never come to see mamma and me!''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>companion</b></font>) murmured.
<div class="bookquote">``Has he (<font color='blue'><b>uncle</b></font>) ever seen me? If he (<font color='blue'><b>uncle</b></font>) has, I must have been a baby. I remember
not a single thing about him (<font color='blue'><b>uncle</b></font>)!''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Why, Master Linton,''  (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div>said I, `three hundred miles is a great distance;
and ten years seem very different in length to a grown-up person compared
with what they do to you. It is probable Mr. Heathcliff proposed going
from summer to summer, but never found a convenient opportunity; and now
it is too late. Don't trouble him (<font color='blue'><b>Heathcliff</b></font>) with questions on the subject: it will
disturb him (<font color='blue'><b>Heathcliff</b></font>), for no good.''

<p/>The boy was fully occupied with his (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>) own cogitations for the remainder of
the ride, till we halted before the farmhouse garden-gate. I watched to
catch his (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>) impressions in his (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>) countenance. He (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>) surveyed the carved front
and low-browed lattices, the straggling gooseberry-bushes and crooked
firs, with solemn intentness, and then shook his (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>) head: his (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>) private
feelings entirely disapproved of the exterior of his (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>) new abode. But he (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>)
had sense to postpone complaining: there might be compensation within.
Before he (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>) dismounted, I went and opened the door. It was half-past six;
the family had just finished breakfast: the servant was clearing and
wiping down the table. Joseph stood by his (<font color='blue'><b>Joseph</b></font>) master's chair telling some
tale concerning a lame horse; and Hareton was preparing for the hayfield.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Hallo, Nelly!''  (<font color='red'><b>Heathcliff/Mr. Heathcliff</b></font>)</div>said Mr. Heathcliff, when he (<font color='blue'><b>Heathcliff</b></font>) saw me. <div class="bookquote">``I feared I should
have to come down and fetch my property myself. You've brought it, have
you? Let us see what we can make of it.''

 (<font color='red'><b>He</b></font>)</div><p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Heathcliff</b></font>) got up and strode to the door: Hareton and Joseph followed in gaping
curiosity. Poor Linton ran a frightened eye over the faces of the three.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Sure-ly,''  (<font color='red'><b>Joseph</b></font>)</div>said Joseph after a grave inspection, `he (<font color='blue'><b>Joseph</b></font>)'s swopped wi' ye,
Maister, an' yon's his (<font color='blue'><b>Joseph</b></font>) lass!''

<p/>Heathcliff, having stared his (<font color='blue'><b>Heathcliff</b></font>) son into an ague of confusion, uttered a
scornful laugh.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``God! what a beauty! what a lovely, charming thing!''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Heathcliff</b></font>) exclaimed.
<div class="bookquote">``Hav'n't they reared it on snails and sour milk, Nelly? Oh, damn my
soul! but that's worse than I expected--and the devil knows I was not
sanguine!''

 (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div><p/>I bid the trembling and bewildered child get down, and enter. He (<font color='blue'><b>Heathcliff</b></font>) did not
thoroughly comprehend the meaning of his (<font color='blue'><b>Heathcliff</b></font>) father's speech, or whether it
were intended for him (<font color='blue'><b>Heathcliff</b></font>): indeed, he (<font color='blue'><b>Heathcliff</b></font>) was not yet certain that the grim,
sneering stranger was his (<font color='blue'><b>stranger</b></font>) father. But he (<font color='blue'><b>stranger</b></font>) clung to me with growing
trepidation; and on Mr. Heathcliff's taking a seat and bidding him (<font color='blue'><b>Heathcliff</b></font>) `come
hither' he (<font color='blue'><b>Heathcliff</b></font>) hid his (<font color='blue'><b>Heathcliff</b></font>) face on my shoulder and wept.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Tut, tut!''  (<font color='red'><b>Heathcliff/Mr. Heathcliff</b></font>)</div>said Heathcliff, stretching out a hand and dragging him (<font color='blue'><b>Heathcliff</b></font>)
roughly between his (<font color='blue'><b>Heathcliff</b></font>) knees, and then holding up his (<font color='blue'><b>Heathcliff</b></font>) head by the chin.
<div class="bookquote">``None of that nonsense! We're not going to hurt thee, Linton--isn't that
thy name? Thou art thy mother's child, entirely! Where is my share in
thee, puling chicken?''

 (<font color='red'><b>He</b></font>)</div><p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Heathcliff</b></font>) took off the boy's cap and pushed back his (<font color='blue'><b>Heathcliff</b></font>) thick flaxen curls, felt
his (<font color='blue'><b>Heathcliff</b></font>) slender arms and his (<font color='blue'><b>Heathcliff</b></font>) small fingers; during which examination Linton
ceased crying, and lifted his (<font color='blue'><b>Heathcliff</b></font>) great blue eyes to inspect the inspector.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Do you know me?''  (<font color='red'><b>Heathcliff/Mr. Heathcliff</b></font>)</div>asked Heathcliff, having satisfied himself that the
limbs were all equally frail and feeble.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``No,''  (<font color='red'><b>Linton/Mrs. Linton/Mrs. Heathcliff</b></font>)</div>said Linton, with a gaze of vacant fear.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``You've heard of me, I daresay?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``No,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Heathcliff</b></font>) replied again.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``No! What a shame of your mother, never to waken your filial regard for
me! You are my son, then, I'll tell you; and your mother was a wicked
slut to leave you in ignorance of the sort of father you possessed. Now,
don't wince, and colour up! Though it is something to see you have not
white blood. Be a good lad; and I'll do for you. Nelly, if you be tired
you may sit down; if not, get home again. I guess you'll report what you
hear and see to the cipher at the Grange; and this thing won't be settled
while you linger about it.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Well,''  (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div>replied I, <div class="bookquote">``I hope you'll be kind to the boy, Mr. Heathcliff, or
you'll not keep him (<font color='blue'><b>Heathcliff</b></font>) long; and he (<font color='blue'><b>Heathcliff</b></font>)'s all you have akin in the wide world,
that you will ever know--remember.''

 (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I'll be very kind to him (<font color='blue'><b>Heathcliff</b></font>), you needn't fear,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Heathcliff</b></font>) said, laughing. <div class="bookquote">``Only
nobody else must be kind to him (<font color='blue'><b>Heathcliff</b></font>): I'm jealous of monopolising his (<font color='blue'><b>Heathcliff</b></font>)
affection. And, to begin my kindness, Joseph, bring the lad some
breakfast. Hareton, you infernal calf, begone to your work. Yes, Nell,''
 (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Heathcliff</b></font>) added, when they had departed, `my son is prospective owner of your
place, and I should not wish him (<font color='blue'><b>son</b></font>) to die till I was certain of being his (<font color='blue'><b>son</b></font>)
successor. Besides, he (<font color='blue'><b>son</b></font>)'s _mine_, and I want the triumph of seeing _my_
descendant fairly lord of their estates; my child hiring their children
to till their fathers' lands for wages. That is the sole consideration
which can make me endure the whelp: I despise him (<font color='blue'><b>lord</b></font>) for himself, and hate
him (<font color='blue'><b>lord</b></font>) for the memories he (<font color='blue'><b>lord</b></font>) revives! But that consideration is sufficient:
he (<font color='blue'><b>lord</b></font>)'s as safe with me, and shall be tended as carefully as your master
tends his (<font color='blue'><b>master</b></font>) own. I have a room up-stairs, furnished for him (<font color='blue'><b>master</b></font>) in handsome
style; I've engaged a tutor, also, to come three times a week, from
twenty miles' distance, to teach him (<font color='blue'><b>master</b></font>) what he (<font color='blue'><b>master</b></font>) pleases to learn. I've
ordered Hareton to obey him (<font color='blue'><b>Hareton</b></font>): and in fact I've arranged everything with a
view to preserve the superior and the gentleman in him (<font color='blue'><b>gentleman</b></font>), above his (<font color='blue'><b>gentleman</b></font>)
associates. I do regret, however, that he (<font color='blue'><b>gentleman</b></font>) so little deserves the
trouble: if I wished any blessing in the world, it was to find him (<font color='blue'><b>gentleman</b></font>) a
worthy object of pride; and I'm bitterly disappointed with the
whey-faced, whining wretch!''

<p/>While he (<font color='blue'><b>gentleman</b></font>) was speaking, Joseph returned bearing a basin of milk-porridge,
and placed it before Linton: who stirred round the homely mess with a
look of aversion, and affirmed he (<font color='blue'><b>Joseph</b></font>) could not eat it. I saw the old
man-servant shared largely in his (<font color='blue'><b>Joseph</b></font>) master's scorn of the child; though he (<font color='blue'><b>Joseph</b></font>)
was compelled to retain the sentiment in his (<font color='blue'><b>Joseph</b></font>) heart, because Heathcliff
plainly meant his (<font color='blue'><b>Heathcliff</b></font>) underlings to hold him (<font color='blue'><b>Heathcliff</b></font>) in honour.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Cannot ate it?''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>repeated he (<font color='blue'><b>Heathcliff</b></font>), peering in Linton's face, and subduing his (<font color='blue'><b>Heathcliff</b></font>)
voice to a whisper, for fear of being overheard. <div class="bookquote">``But Maister Hareton
nivir ate naught else, when he (<font color='blue'><b>Hareton</b></font>) wer a little `un; and what wer gooid
enough for him (<font color='blue'><b>Hareton</b></font>)'s gooid enough for ye, I's rayther think!''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I _sha'n't_ eat it!''  (<font color='red'><b>Linton/Mrs. Linton/Mrs. Heathcliff</b></font>)</div>answered Linton, snappishly. <div class="bookquote">``Take it away.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Joseph</b></font>)</div><p/>Joseph snatched up the food indignantly, and brought it to us.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Is there aught ails th' victuals?''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Joseph</b></font>) asked, thrusting the tray under
Heathcliff's nose.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``What should ail them?''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Heathcliff</b></font>) said.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Wah!''  (<font color='red'><b>Joseph</b></font>)</div>answered Joseph, `yon dainty chap says he (<font color='blue'><b>Joseph</b></font>) cannut ate 'em. But I
guess it's raight! His (<font color='blue'><b>Joseph</b></font>) mother wer just soa--we wer a`most too mucky to
sow t' corn for makking her (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) breead.''

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Don't mention his (<font color='blue'><b>Hareton</b></font>) mother to me,''  (<font color='red'><b>the master</b></font>)</div>said the master, angrily. <div class="bookquote">``Get him (<font color='blue'><b>Hareton</b></font>)
something that he (<font color='blue'><b>Hareton</b></font>) can eat, that's all. What is his (<font color='blue'><b>Hareton</b></font>) usual food, Nelly?''

 (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div><p/>I suggested boiled milk or tea; and the housekeeper received instructions
to prepare some. Come, I reflected, his (<font color='blue'><b>master</b></font>) father's selfishness may
contribute to his (<font color='blue'><b>master</b></font>) comfort. He (<font color='blue'><b>master</b></font>) perceives his (<font color='blue'><b>master</b></font>) delicate constitution, and
the necessity of treating him (<font color='blue'><b>master</b></font>) tolerably. I'll console Mr. Edgar by
acquainting him (<font color='blue'><b>Edgar</b></font>) with the turn Heathcliff's humour has taken. Having no
excuse for lingering longer, I slipped out, while Linton was engaged in
timidly rebuffing the advances of a friendly sheep-dog. But he (<font color='blue'><b>Heathcliff</b></font>) was too
much on the alert to be cheated: as I closed the door, I heard a cry, and
a frantic repetition of the words--

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Don't leave me! I'll not stay here! I'll not stay here!''

 (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div><p/>Then the latch was raised and fell: they did not suffer him (<font color='blue'><b>Heathcliff</b></font>) to come
forth. I mounted Minny, and urged her (<font color='blue'><b>Linton</b></font>) to a trot; and so my brief
guardianship ended.




<p/>CHAPTER XXI


<p/>We had sad work with little Cathy that day: she (<font color='blue'><b>Cathy</b></font>) rose in high glee, eager
to join her (<font color='blue'><b>Cathy</b></font>) cousin, and such passionate tears and lamentations followed
the news of his (<font color='blue'><b>cousin</b></font>) departure that Edgar himself was obliged to soothe her (<font color='blue'><b>Cathy</b></font>),
by affirming he (<font color='blue'><b>Edgar</b></font>) should come back soon: he (<font color='blue'><b>Edgar</b></font>) added, however, `if I can get
him (<font color='blue'><b>Edgar</b></font>)'; and there were no hopes of that. This promise poorly pacified her (<font color='blue'><b>Cathy</b></font>);
but time was more potent; and though still at intervals she (<font color='blue'><b>Cathy</b></font>) inquired of
her (<font color='blue'><b>Cathy</b></font>) father when Linton would return, before she (<font color='blue'><b>Linton</b></font>) did see him (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) again his (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>)
features had waxed so dim in her (<font color='blue'><b>Linton</b></font>) memory that she (<font color='blue'><b>Linton</b></font>) did not recognise him (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>).

<p/>When I chanced to encounter the housekeeper of Wuthering Heights, in
paying business visits to Gimmerton, I used to ask how the young master
got on; for he (<font color='blue'><b>master</b></font>) lived almost as secluded as Catherine herself, and was
never to be seen. I could gather from her (<font color='blue'><b>Catherine</b></font>) that he (<font color='blue'><b>master</b></font>) continued in weak
health, and was a tiresome inmate. She (<font color='blue'><b>Catherine</b></font>) said Mr. Heathcliff seemed to
dislike him (<font color='blue'><b>Heathcliff</b></font>) ever longer and worse, though he (<font color='blue'><b>Heathcliff</b></font>) took some trouble to conceal
it: he (<font color='blue'><b>Heathcliff</b></font>) had an antipathy to the sound of his (<font color='blue'><b>Heathcliff</b></font>) voice, and could not do at
all with his (<font color='blue'><b>Heathcliff</b></font>) sitting in the same room with him (<font color='blue'><b>Heathcliff</b></font>) many minutes together.
There seldom passed much talk between them: Linton learnt his (<font color='blue'><b>Heathcliff</b></font>) lessons and
spent his (<font color='blue'><b>Heathcliff</b></font>) evenings in a small apartment they called the parlour: or else
lay in bed all day: for he (<font color='blue'><b>Heathcliff</b></font>) was constantly getting coughs, and colds, and
aches, and pains of some sort.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``And I never know such a fainthearted creature,''  (<font color='red'><b>the woman</b></font>)</div>added the woman; `nor
one so careful of hisseln. He (<font color='blue'><b>Heathcliff</b></font>) _will_ go on, if I leave the window open a
bit late in the evening. Oh! it's killing, a breath of night air! And he (<font color='blue'><b>Heathcliff</b></font>)
must have a fire in the middle of summer; and Joseph's bacca-pipe is
poison; and he (<font color='blue'><b>Joseph</b></font>) must always have sweets and dainties, and always milk,
milk for ever--heeding naught how the rest of us are pinched in winter;
and there he (<font color='blue'><b>Joseph</b></font>)'ll sit, wrapped in his (<font color='blue'><b>Joseph</b></font>) furred cloak in his (<font color='blue'><b>Joseph</b></font>) chair by the
fire, with some toast and water or other slop on the hob to sip at; and
if Hareton, for pity, comes to amuse him (<font color='blue'><b>Joseph</b></font>)--Hareton is not bad-natured,
though he (<font color='blue'><b>Hareton</b></font>)'s rough--they're sure to part, one swearing and the other
crying. I believe the master would relish Earnshaw's thrashing him (<font color='blue'><b>master</b></font>) to a
mummy, if he (<font color='blue'><b>master</b></font>) were not his (<font color='blue'><b>master</b></font>) son; and I'm certain he (<font color='blue'><b>master</b></font>) would be fit to turn
him (<font color='blue'><b>master</b></font>) out of doors, if he (<font color='blue'><b>master</b></font>) knew half the nursing he (<font color='blue'><b>master</b></font>) gives hisseln. But then
he (<font color='blue'><b>master</b></font>) won't go into danger of temptation: he (<font color='blue'><b>master</b></font>) never enters the parlour, and
should Linton show those ways in the house where he (<font color='blue'><b>master</b></font>) is, he (<font color='blue'><b>master</b></font>) sends him (<font color='blue'><b>master</b></font>)
up-stairs directly.''

<p/>I divined, from this account, that utter lack of sympathy had rendered
young Heathcliff selfish and disagreeable, if he (<font color='blue'><b>Heathcliff</b></font>) were not so originally;
and my interest in him (<font color='blue'><b>Heathcliff</b></font>), consequently, decayed: though still I was moved
with a sense of grief at his (<font color='blue'><b>Heathcliff</b></font>) lot, and a wish that he (<font color='blue'><b>Heathcliff</b></font>) had been left with
us. Mr. Edgar encouraged me to gain information: he (<font color='blue'><b>Edgar</b></font>) thought a great deal
about him (<font color='blue'><b>Edgar</b></font>), I fancy, and would have run some risk to see him (<font color='blue'><b>Edgar</b></font>); and he (<font color='blue'><b>Edgar</b></font>) told
me once to ask the housekeeper whether he (<font color='blue'><b>Edgar</b></font>) ever came into the village? She (<font color='blue'><b>housekeeper</b></font>)
said he (<font color='blue'><b>Edgar</b></font>) had only been twice, on horseback, accompanying his (<font color='blue'><b>Edgar</b></font>) father; and
both times he (<font color='blue'><b>Edgar</b></font>) pretended to be quite knocked up for three or four days
afterwards. That housekeeper left, if I recollect rightly, two years
after he (<font color='blue'><b>Edgar</b></font>) came; and another, whom I did not know, was her (<font color='blue'><b>housekeeper</b></font>) successor; she (<font color='blue'><b>housekeeper</b></font>)
lives there still.

<p/>Time wore on at the Grange in its former pleasant way till Miss Cathy
reached sixteen. On the anniversary of her (<font color='blue'><b>Cathy</b></font>) birth we never manifested any
signs of rejoicing, because it was also the anniversary of my late
mistress's death. Her (<font color='blue'><b>mistress</b></font>) father invariably spent that day alone in the
library; and walked, at dusk, as far as Gimmerton kirkyard, where he (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>)
would frequently prolong his (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) stay beyond midnight. Therefore Catherine
was thrown on her (<font color='blue'><b>Catherine</b></font>) own resources for amusement. This twentieth of March
was a beautiful spring day, and when her (<font color='blue'><b>Catherine</b></font>) father had retired, my young
lady came down dressed for going out, and said she (<font color='blue'><b>Catherine</b></font>) asked to have a ramble
on the edge of the moor with me: Mr. Linton had given her (<font color='blue'><b>Catherine</b></font>) leave, if we
went only a short distance and were back within the hour.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``So make haste, Ellen!''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Catherine</b></font>) cried. <div class="bookquote">``I know where I wish to go; where a
colony of moor-game are settled: I want to see whether they have made
their nests yet.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``That must be a good distance up,''  (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div>I answered; `they don't breed on the
edge of the moor.''

<p/><div class="bookquote">``No, it's not,''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Catherine</b></font>) said. <div class="bookquote">``I've gone very near with papa.''

 (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div><p/>I put on my bonnet and sallied out, thinking nothing more of the matter.
She (<font color='blue'><b>Catherine</b></font>) bounded before me, and returned to my side, and was off again like a
young greyhound; and, at first, I found plenty of entertainment in
listening to the larks singing far and near, and enjoying the sweet, warm
sunshine; and watching her (<font color='blue'><b>Catherine</b></font>), my pet and my delight, with her (<font color='blue'><b>Catherine</b></font>) golden
ringlets flying loose behind, and her (<font color='blue'><b>Catherine</b></font>) bright cheek, as soft and pure in
its bloom as a wild rose, and her (<font color='blue'><b>Catherine</b></font>) eyes radiant with cloudless pleasure.
She (<font color='blue'><b>Catherine</b></font>) was a happy creature, and an angel, in those days. It's a pity she (<font color='blue'><b>Catherine</b></font>)
could not be content.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Well,''  (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div>said I, `where are your moor-game, Miss Cathy? We should be at
them: the Grange park-fence is a great way off now.''

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Oh, a little further--only a little further, Ellen,''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>was her (<font color='blue'><b>Cathy</b></font>) answer,
continually. <div class="bookquote">``Climb to that hillock, pass that bank, and by the time you
reach the other side I shall have raised the birds.''

 (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div><p/>But there were so many hillocks and banks to climb and pass, that, at
length, I began to be weary, and told her (<font color='blue'><b>Cathy</b></font>) we must halt, and retrace our
steps. I shouted to her (<font color='blue'><b>Cathy</b></font>), as she (<font color='blue'><b>Cathy</b></font>) had outstripped me a long way; she (<font color='blue'><b>Cathy</b></font>)
either did not hear or did not regard, for she (<font color='blue'><b>Cathy</b></font>) still sprang on, and I was
compelled to follow. Finally, she (<font color='blue'><b>Cathy</b></font>) dived into a hollow; and before I came
in sight of her (<font color='blue'><b>Cathy</b></font>) again, she (<font color='blue'><b>Cathy</b></font>) was two miles nearer Wuthering Heights than
her (<font color='blue'><b>Cathy</b></font>) own home; and I beheld a couple of persons arrest her (<font color='blue'><b>Cathy</b></font>), one of whom I
felt convinced was Mr. Heathcliff himself.

<p/>Cathy had been caught in the fact of plundering, or, at least, hunting
out the nests of the grouse. The Heights were Heathcliff's land, and he (<font color='blue'><b>Heathcliff</b></font>)
was reproving the poacher.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``I've neither taken any nor found any,''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Cathy</b></font>) said, as I toiled to them,
expanding her (<font color='blue'><b>Cathy</b></font>) hands in corroboration of the statement. <div class="bookquote">``I didn't mean to
take them; but papa told me there were quantities up here, and I wished
to see the eggs.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Heathcliff/Mr. Heathcliff</b></font>)</div><p/>Heathcliff glanced at me with an ill-meaning smile, expressing his (<font color='blue'><b>Heathcliff</b></font>)
acquaintance with the party, and, consequently, his (<font color='blue'><b>Heathcliff</b></font>) malevolence towards
it, and demanded who `papa' was?

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Mr. Linton of Thrushcross Grange,''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Cathy</b></font>) replied. <div class="bookquote">``I thought you did not
know me, or you wouldn't have spoken in that way.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``You suppose papa is highly esteemed and respected, then?''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Heathcliff</b></font>) said,
sarcastically.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``And what are you?''  (<font color='red'><b>Catherine/Earnshaw/Catherine Earnshaw</b></font>)</div>inquired Catherine, gazing curiously on the speaker.
<div class="bookquote">``That man I've seen before. Is he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) your son?''

 (<font color='red'><b>She</b></font>)</div><p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>Catherine</b></font>) pointed to Hareton, the other individual, who had gained nothing but
increased bulk and strength by the addition of two years to his (<font color='blue'><b>Heathcliff</b></font>) age: he (<font color='blue'><b>Heathcliff</b></font>)
seemed as awkward and rough as ever.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Miss Cathy,''  (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div>I interrupted, `it will be three hours instead of one that
we are out, presently. We really must go back.''

<p/><div class="bookquote">``No, that man is not my son,''  (<font color='red'><b>Heathcliff/Mr. Heathcliff</b></font>)</div>answered Heathcliff, pushing me aside. <div class="bookquote">``But
I have one, and you have seen him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) before too; and, though your nurse is
in a hurry, I think both you and she (<font color='blue'><b>nurse</b></font>) would be the better for a little
rest. Will you just turn this nab of heath, and walk into my house?
You'll get home earlier for the ease; and you shall receive a kind
welcome.''

 (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div><p/>I whispered Catherine that she (<font color='blue'><b>Catherine</b></font>) mustn't, on any account, accede to the
proposal: it was entirely out of the question.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Why?''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Catherine</b></font>) asked, aloud. <div class="bookquote">``I'm tired of running, and the ground is dewy:
I can't sit here. Let us go, Ellen. Besides, he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) says I have seen his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>)
son. He (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>)'s mistaken, I think; but I guess where he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) lives: at the
farmhouse I visited in coming from Penistone Crags. Don't you?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I do. Come, Nelly, hold your tongue--it will be a treat for her (<font color='blue'><b>Ellen</b></font>) to look
in on us. Hareton, get forwards with the lass. You shall walk with me,
Nelly.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``No, she (<font color='blue'><b>Ellen</b></font>)'s not going to any such place,''  (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div>I cried, struggling to release
my arm, which he (<font color='blue'><b>Heathcliff</b></font>) had seized: but she (<font color='blue'><b>Catherine</b></font>) was almost at the door-stones
already, scampering round the brow at full speed. Her (<font color='blue'><b>Catherine</b></font>) appointed
companion did not pretend to escort her (<font color='blue'><b>Catherine</b></font>): he (<font color='blue'><b>companion</b></font>) shied off by the road-side,
and vanished.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Mr. Heathcliff, it's very wrong,''  (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div>I continued: `you know you mean no
good. And there she (<font color='blue'><b>Catherine</b></font>)'ll see Linton, and all will be told as soon as ever
we return; and I shall have the blame.''

<p/><div class="bookquote">``I want her (<font color='blue'><b>Ellen</b></font>) to see Linton,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>companion</b></font>) answered; `he (<font color='blue'><b>companion</b></font>)'s looking better these few
days; it's not often he (<font color='blue'><b>companion</b></font>)'s fit to be seen. And we'll soon persuade her (<font color='blue'><b>Linton</b></font>) to
keep the visit secret: where is the harm of it?''

<p/><div class="bookquote">``The harm of it is, that her (<font color='blue'><b>Ellen</b></font>) father would hate me if he (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) found I suffered
her (<font color='blue'><b>Ellen</b></font>) to enter your house; and I am convinced you have a bad design in
encouraging her (<font color='blue'><b>Ellen</b></font>) to do so,''  (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div>I replied.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``My design is as honest as possible. I'll inform you of its whole
scope,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>companion</b></font>) said. <div class="bookquote">``That the two cousins may fall in love, and get
married. I'm acting generously to your master: his (<font color='blue'><b>master</b></font>) young chit has no
expectations, and should she (<font color='blue'><b>Ellen</b></font>) second my wishes she (<font color='blue'><b>Ellen</b></font>)'ll be provided for at
once as joint successor with Linton.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``If Linton died,''  (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div>I answered, `and his (<font color='blue'><b>companion</b></font>) life is quite uncertain, Catherine
would be the heir.''

<p/><div class="bookquote">``No, she (<font color='blue'><b>Linton</b></font>) would not,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>companion</b></font>) said. <div class="bookquote">``There is no clause in the will to secure
it so: his (<font color='blue'><b>successor</b></font>) property would go to me; but, to prevent disputes, I desire
their union, and am resolved to bring it about.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``And I'm resolved she (<font color='blue'><b>Linton</b></font>) shall never approach your house with me again,''  (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div>I
returned, as we reached the gate, where Miss Cathy waited our coming.

<p/>Heathcliff bade me be quiet; and, preceding us up the path, hastened to
open the door. My young lady gave him (<font color='blue'><b>Heathcliff</b></font>) several looks, as if she (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) could not
exactly make up her (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) mind what to think of him (<font color='blue'><b>Heathcliff</b></font>); but now he (<font color='blue'><b>Heathcliff</b></font>) smiled when he (<font color='blue'><b>Heathcliff</b></font>)
met her (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) eye, and softened his (<font color='blue'><b>Heathcliff</b></font>) voice in addressing her (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>); and I was foolish
enough to imagine the memory of her (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) mother might disarm him (<font color='blue'><b>Heathcliff</b></font>) from desiring
her (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) injury. Linton stood on the hearth. He (<font color='blue'><b>Heathcliff</b></font>) had been out walking in the
fields, for his (<font color='blue'><b>Heathcliff</b></font>) cap was on, and he (<font color='blue'><b>Heathcliff</b></font>) was calling to Joseph to bring him (<font color='blue'><b>Heathcliff</b></font>) dry
shoes. He (<font color='blue'><b>Heathcliff</b></font>) had grown tall of his (<font color='blue'><b>Heathcliff</b></font>) age, still wanting some months of
sixteen. His (<font color='blue'><b>Heathcliff</b></font>) features were pretty yet, and his (<font color='blue'><b>Heathcliff</b></font>) eye and complexion
brighter than I remembered them, though with merely temporary lustre
borrowed from the salubrious air and genial sun.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Now, who is that?''  (<font color='red'><b>Heathcliff/Mr. Heathcliff</b></font>)</div>asked Mr. Heathcliff, turning to Cathy. <div class="bookquote">``Can you
tell?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Your son?''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Cathy</b></font>) said, having doubtfully surveyed, first one and then the
other.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Yes, yes,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>answered he (<font color='blue'><b>Heathcliff</b></font>): `but is this the only time you have beheld him (<font color='blue'><b>Heathcliff</b></font>)?
Think! Ah! you have a short memory. Linton, don't you recall your
cousin, that you used to tease us so with wishing to see?''

<p/><div class="bookquote">``What, Linton!''  (<font color='red'><b>Cathy/Miss Cathy</b></font>)</div>cried Cathy, kindling into joyful surprise at the name.
<div class="bookquote">``Is that little Linton? He (<font color='blue'><b>son</b></font>)'s taller than I am! Are you Linton?''

 (<font color='red'><b>The youth</b></font>)</div><p/>The youth stepped forward, and acknowledged himself: she (<font color='blue'><b>Cathy</b></font>) kissed him (<font color='blue'><b>cousin</b></font>)
fervently, and they gazed with wonder at the change time had wrought in
the appearance of each. Catherine had reached her (<font color='blue'><b>Catherine</b></font>) full height; her (<font color='blue'><b>Catherine</b></font>)
figure was both plump and slender, elastic as steel, and her (<font color='blue'><b>Catherine</b></font>) whole aspect
sparkling with health and spirits. Linton's looks and movements were
very languid, and his (<font color='blue'><b>cousin</b></font>) form extremely slight; but there was a grace in his (<font color='blue'><b>cousin</b></font>)
manner that mitigated these defects, and rendered him (<font color='blue'><b>cousin</b></font>) not unpleasing.
After exchanging numerous marks of fondness with him (<font color='blue'><b>cousin</b></font>), his (<font color='blue'><b>cousin</b></font>) cousin went to
Mr. Heathcliff, who lingered by the door, dividing his (<font color='blue'><b>Heathcliff</b></font>) attention between
the objects inside and those that lay without: pretending, that is, to
observe the latter, and really noting the former alone.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``And you are my uncle, then!''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Linton</b></font>) cried, reaching up to salute him (<font color='blue'><b>Heathcliff</b></font>). <div class="bookquote">``I
thought I liked you, though you were cross at first. Why don't you visit
at the Grange with Linton? To live all these years such close
neighbours, and never see us, is odd: what have you done so for?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I visited it once or twice too often before you were born,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Heathcliff</b></font>) answered.
<div class="bookquote">``There--damn it! If you have any kisses to spare, give them to Linton:
they are thrown away on me.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Naughty Ellen!''  (<font color='red'><b>Catherine/Earnshaw/Catherine Earnshaw</b></font>)</div>exclaimed Catherine, flying to attack me next with her (<font color='blue'><b>Catherine</b></font>)
lavish caresses. <div class="bookquote">``Wicked Ellen! to try to hinder me from entering. But
I'll take this walk every morning in future: may I, uncle? and sometimes
bring papa. Won't you be glad to see us?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Of course,''  (<font color='red'><b>the uncle</b></font>)</div>replied the uncle, with a hardly suppressed grimace,
resulting from his (<font color='blue'><b>uncle</b></font>) deep aversion to both the proposed visitors. <div class="bookquote">``But
stay,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>uncle</b></font>) continued, turning towards the young lady. <div class="bookquote">``Now I think of it,
I'd better tell you. Mr. Linton has a prejudice against me: we
quarrelled at one time of our lives, with unchristian ferocity; and, if
you mention coming here to him (<font color='blue'><b>Linton</b></font>), he (<font color='blue'><b>Linton</b></font>)'ll put a veto on your visits
altogether. Therefore, you must not mention it, unless you be careless
of seeing your cousin hereafter: you may come, if you will, but you must
not mention it.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Why did you quarrel?''  (<font color='red'><b>Catherine/Earnshaw/Catherine Earnshaw</b></font>)</div>asked Catherine, considerably crestfallen.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``He (<font color='blue'><b>cousin</b></font>) thought me too poor to wed his (<font color='blue'><b>cousin</b></font>) sister,''  (<font color='red'><b>Heathcliff/Mr. Heathcliff</b></font>)</div>answered Heathcliff, `and was
grieved that I got her (<font color='blue'><b>Catherine</b></font>): his (<font color='blue'><b>Heathcliff</b></font>) pride was hurt, and he (<font color='blue'><b>Heathcliff</b></font>)'ll never forgive it.''

<p/><div class="bookquote">``That's wrong!''  (<font color='red'><b>the lady time</b></font>)</div>said the young lady: `some time I'll tell him (<font color='blue'><b>Heathcliff</b></font>) so. But
Linton and I have no share in your quarrel. I'll not come here, then; he (<font color='blue'><b>Heathcliff</b></font>)
shall come to the Grange.''

<p/><div class="bookquote">``It will be too far for me,''  (<font color='red'><b>cousin</b></font>)</div>murmured her (<font color='blue'><b>Linton</b></font>) cousin: `to walk four miles
would kill me. No, come here, Miss Catherine, now and then: not every
morning, but once or twice a week.''

<p/>The father launched towards his (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) son a glance of bitter contempt.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``I am afraid, Nelly, I shall lose my labour,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) muttered to me. <div class="bookquote">``Miss
Catherine, as the ninny calls her (<font color='blue'><b>Catherine</b></font>), will discover his (<font color='blue'><b>Nelly</b></font>) value, and send him (<font color='blue'><b>Nelly</b></font>)
to the devil. Now, if it had been Hareton!--Do you know that, twenty
times a day, I covet Hareton, with all his (<font color='blue'><b>Hareton</b></font>) degradation? I'd have loved
the lad had he (<font color='blue'><b>Hareton</b></font>) been some one else. But I think he (<font color='blue'><b>Hareton</b></font>)'s safe from _her (<font color='blue'><b>Catherine</b></font>)_
love. I'll pit him (<font color='blue'><b>Hareton</b></font>) against that paltry creature, unless it bestir itself
briskly. We calculate it will scarcely last till it is eighteen. Oh,
confound the vapid thing! He (<font color='blue'><b>Hareton</b></font>)'s absorbed in drying his (<font color='blue'><b>Hareton</b></font>) feet, and never
looks at her (<font color='blue'><b>Catherine</b></font>).--Linton!''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Yes, father,''  (<font color='red'><b>the boy</b></font>)</div>answered the boy.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Have you nothing to show your cousin anywhere about, not even a rabbit
or a weasel's nest? Take her (<font color='blue'><b>Linton</b></font>) into the garden, before you change your
shoes; and into the stable to see your horse.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Wouldn't you rather sit here?''  (<font color='red'><b>Linton/Mrs. Linton/Mrs. Heathcliff</b></font>)</div>asked Linton, addressing Cathy in a tone
which expressed reluctance to move again.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``I don't know,''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Linton</b></font>) replied, casting a longing look to the door, and
evidently eager to be active.

<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) kept his (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) seat, and shrank closer to the fire. Heathcliff rose, and
went into the kitchen, and from thence to the yard, calling out for
Hareton. Hareton responded, and presently the two re-entered. The young
man had been washing himself, as was visible by the glow on his (<font color='blue'><b>Hareton</b></font>) cheeks
and his (<font color='blue'><b>Hareton</b></font>) wetted hair.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Oh, I'll ask _you_, uncle,''  (<font color='red'><b>Cathy/Miss Cathy</b></font>)</div>cried Miss Cathy, recollecting the
housekeeper's assertion. <div class="bookquote">``That is not my cousin, is he (<font color='blue'><b>cousin</b></font>)?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Yes,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Hareton</b></font>), replied, `your mother's nephew. Don't you like him (<font color='blue'><b>Hareton</b></font>)!''

<p/>Catherine looked queer.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Is he (<font color='blue'><b>cousin</b></font>) not a handsome lad?''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Hareton</b></font>) continued.

<p/>The uncivil little thing stood on tiptoe, and whispered a sentence in
Heathcliff's ear. He (<font color='blue'><b>Heathcliff</b></font>) laughed; Hareton darkened: I perceived he (<font color='blue'><b>Hareton</b></font>) was very
sensitive to suspected slights, and had obviously a dim notion of his (<font color='blue'><b>Hareton</b></font>)
inferiority. But his (<font color='blue'><b>Hareton</b></font>) master or guardian chased the frown by exclaiming--

<p/><div class="bookquote">``You'll be the favourite among us, Hareton! She (<font color='blue'><b>Linton</b></font>) says you are a--What was
it? Well, something very flattering. Here! you go with her (<font color='blue'><b>Linton</b></font>) round the
farm. And behave like a gentleman, mind! Don't use any bad words; and
don't stare when the young lady is not looking at you, and be ready to
hide your face when she (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) is; and, when you speak, say your words slowly,
and keep your hands out of your pockets. Be off, and entertain her (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) as
nicely as you can.''

 (<font color='red'><b>guardian</b></font>)</div><p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Hareton</b></font>) watched the couple walking past the window. Earnshaw had his (<font color='blue'><b>Hareton</b></font>)
countenance completely averted from his (<font color='blue'><b>Hareton</b></font>) companion. He (<font color='blue'><b>Hareton</b></font>) seemed studying
the familiar landscape with a stranger's and an artist's interest.
Catherine took a sly look at him (<font color='blue'><b>Hareton</b></font>), expressing small admiration. She (<font color='blue'><b>Catherine</b></font>) then
turned her (<font color='blue'><b>Catherine</b></font>) attention to seeking out objects of amusement for herself, and
tripped merrily on, lilting a tune to supply the lack of conversation.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``I've tied his (<font color='blue'><b>gentleman</b></font>) tongue,''  (<font color='red'><b>Heathcliff/Mr. Heathcliff</b></font>)</div>observed Heathcliff. ``He (<font color='blue'><b>gentleman</b></font>)'ll not venture a single
syllable all the time! Nelly, you recollect me at his (<font color='blue'><b>Nelly</b></font>) age--nay, some
years younger. Did I ever look so stupid: so ``gaumless,<div class="bookquote">'' as Joseph calls
it?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Worse,''  (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div>I replied, `because more sullen with it.''

<p/><div class="bookquote">``I've a pleasure in him (<font color='blue'><b>Nelly</b></font>),''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Heathcliff</b></font>) continued, reflecting aloud. <div class="bookquote">``He (<font color='blue'><b>Nelly</b></font>) has
satisfied my expectations. If he (<font color='blue'><b>Nelly</b></font>) were a born fool I should not enjoy it
half so much. But he (<font color='blue'><b>Nelly</b></font>)'s no fool; and I can sympathise with all his (<font color='blue'><b>Nelly</b></font>)
feelings, having felt them myself. I know what he (<font color='blue'><b>Nelly</b></font>) suffers now, for
instance, exactly: it is merely a beginning of what he (<font color='blue'><b>Nelly</b></font>) shall suffer,
though. And he (<font color='blue'><b>Nelly</b></font>)'ll never be able to emerge from his (<font color='blue'><b>Nelly</b></font>) bathos of coarseness
and ignorance. I've got him (<font color='blue'><b>Nelly</b></font>) faster than his (<font color='blue'><b>Nelly</b></font>) scoundrel of a father
secured me, and lower; for he (<font color='blue'><b>Nelly</b></font>) takes a pride in his (<font color='blue'><b>Nelly</b></font>) brutishness. I've
taught him (<font color='blue'><b>Nelly</b></font>) to scorn everything extra-animal as silly and weak. Don't you
think Hindley would be proud of his (<font color='blue'><b>Hindley</b></font>) son, if he (<font color='blue'><b>Hindley</b></font>) could see him (<font color='blue'><b>Hindley</b></font>)? almost as
proud as I am of mine. But there's this difference; one is gold put to
the use of paving-stones, and the other is tin polished to ape a service
of silver. _Mine_ has nothing valuable about it; yet I shall have the
merit of making it go as far as such poor stuff can go. _His (<font color='blue'><b>Hindley</b></font>)_ had
first-rate qualities, and they are lost: rendered worse than unavailing.
I have nothing to regret; he (<font color='blue'><b>Hindley</b></font>) would have more than any but I are aware
of. And the best of it is, Hareton is damnably fond of me! You'll own
that I've outmatched Hindley there. If the dead villain could rise from
his (<font color='blue'><b>villain</b></font>) grave to abuse me for his (<font color='blue'><b>villain</b></font>) offspring's wrongs, I should have the fun
of seeing the said offspring fight him (<font color='blue'><b>villain</b></font>) back again, indignant that he (<font color='blue'><b>villain</b></font>)
should dare to rail at the one friend he (<font color='blue'><b>villain</b></font>) has in the world!''

 (<font color='red'><b>Heathcliff/Mr. Heathcliff</b></font>)</div><p/>Heathcliff chuckled a fiendish laugh at the idea. I made no reply,
because I saw that he (<font color='blue'><b>Heathcliff</b></font>) expected none. Meantime, our young companion, who
sat too removed from us to hear what was said, began to evince symptoms
of uneasiness, probably repenting that he (<font color='blue'><b>companion</b></font>) had denied himself the treat of
Catherine's society for fear of a little fatigue. His (<font color='blue'><b>companion</b></font>) father remarked
the restless glances wandering to the window, and the hand irresolutely
extended towards his (<font color='blue'><b>companion</b></font>) cap.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Get up, you idle boy!''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>companion</b></font>) exclaimed, with assumed heartiness.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Away after them! they are just at the corner, by the stand of hives.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Linton/Mrs. Linton/Mrs. Heathcliff</b></font>)</div><p/>Linton gathered his (<font color='blue'><b>companion</b></font>) energies, and left the hearth. The lattice was open,
and, as he (<font color='blue'><b>companion</b></font>) stepped out, I heard Cathy inquiring of her (<font color='blue'><b>Cathy</b></font>) unsociable
attendant what was that inscription over the door? Hareton stared up, and
scratched his (<font color='blue'><b>Hareton</b></font>) head like a true clown.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``It's some damnable writing,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Hareton</b></font>) answered. <div class="bookquote">``I cannot read it.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Can't read it?''  (<font color='red'><b>Catherine/Earnshaw/Catherine Earnshaw</b></font>)</div>cried Catherine; <div class="bookquote">``I can read it: it's English. But I
want to know why it is there.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Catherine/Earnshaw/Catherine Earnshaw</b></font>)</div><p/>Linton giggled: the first appearance of mirth he (<font color='blue'><b>Hareton</b></font>) had exhibited.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``He (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>) does not know his (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>) letters,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Hareton</b></font>) said to his (<font color='blue'><b>Hareton</b></font>) cousin. <div class="bookquote">``Could you
believe in the existence of such a colossal dunce?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Is he (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>) all as he (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>) should be?''  (<font color='red'><b>Cathy/Miss Cathy</b></font>)</div>asked Miss Cathy, seriously; `or is he (<font color='blue'><b>Hareton</b></font>)
simple: not right? I've questioned him (<font color='blue'><b>Hareton</b></font>) twice now, and each time he (<font color='blue'><b>Hareton</b></font>)
looked so stupid I think he (<font color='blue'><b>Hareton</b></font>) does not understand me. I can hardly
understand him (<font color='blue'><b>Hareton</b></font>), I'm sure!''

<p/>Linton repeated his (<font color='blue'><b>Hareton</b></font>) laugh, and glanced at Hareton tauntingly; who
certainly did not seem quite clear of comprehension at that moment.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``There's nothing the matter but laziness; is there, Earnshaw?''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Hareton</b></font>) said.
``My cousin fancies you are an idiot. There you experience the
consequence of scorning ``book-larning,<div class="bookquote">'' as you would say. Have you
noticed, Catherine, his (<font color='blue'><b>Hareton</b></font>) frightful Yorkshire pronunciation?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/>``Why, where the devil is the use on<div class="bookquote">``t?''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>growled Hareton, more ready in
answering his (<font color='blue'><b>Hareton</b></font>) daily companion. He (<font color='blue'><b>Hareton</b></font>) was about to enlarge further, but the
two youngsters broke into a noisy fit of merriment: my giddy miss being
delighted to discover that she (<font color='blue'><b>Catherine</b></font>) might turn his (<font color='blue'><b>Hareton</b></font>) strange talk to matter of
amusement.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Where is the use of the devil in that sentence?''  (<font color='red'><b>Linton/Mrs. Linton/Mrs. Heathcliff</b></font>)</div>tittered Linton. <div class="bookquote">``Papa
told you not to say any bad words, and you can't open your mouth without
one. Do try to behave like a gentleman, now do!''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``If thou weren't more a lass than a lad, I'd fell thee this minute, I
would; pitiful lath of a crater!''  (<font color='red'><b>the boor</b></font>)</div>retorted the angry boor, retreating,
while his (<font color='blue'><b>Hareton</b></font>) face burnt with mingled rage and mortification! for he (<font color='blue'><b>Hareton</b></font>) was
conscious of being insulted, and embarrassed how to resent it.

<p/>Mr. Heathcliff having overheard the conversation, as well as I, smiled
when he (<font color='blue'><b>Heathcliff</b></font>) saw him (<font color='blue'><b>Heathcliff</b></font>) go; but immediately afterwards cast a look of singular
aversion on the flippant pair, who remained chattering in the door-way:
the boy finding animation enough while discussing Hareton's faults and
deficiencies, and relating anecdotes of his (<font color='blue'><b>Hareton</b></font>) goings on; and the girl
relishing his (<font color='blue'><b>Hareton</b></font>) pert and spiteful sayings, without considering the
ill-nature they evinced. I began to dislike, more than to compassionate
Linton, and to excuse his (<font color='blue'><b>Hareton</b></font>) father in some measure for holding him (<font color='blue'><b>Hareton</b></font>) cheap.

<p/>We stayed till afternoon: I could not tear Miss Cathy away sooner; but
happily my master had not quitted his (<font color='blue'><b>master</b></font>) apartment, and remained ignorant of
our prolonged absence. As we walked home, I would fain have enlightened
my charge on the characters of the people we had quitted: but she (<font color='blue'><b>Cathy</b></font>) got it
into her (<font color='blue'><b>Cathy</b></font>) head that I was prejudiced against them.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Aha!''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Cathy</b></font>) cried, `you take papa's side, Ellen: you are partial I know;
or else you wouldn't have cheated me so many years into the notion that
Linton lived a long way from here. I'm really extremely angry; only I'm
so pleased I can't show it! But you must hold your tongue about _my_
uncle; he (<font color='blue'><b>uncle</b></font>)'s my uncle, remember; and I'll scold papa for quarrelling with
him (<font color='blue'><b>uncle</b></font>).''

<p/>And so she (<font color='blue'><b>Linton</b></font>) ran on, till I relinquished the endeavour to convince her (<font color='blue'><b>Linton</b></font>) of
her (<font color='blue'><b>Linton</b></font>) mistake. She (<font color='blue'><b>Linton</b></font>) did not mention the visit that night, because she (<font color='blue'><b>Linton</b></font>) did
not see Mr. Linton. Next day it all came out, sadly to my chagrin; and
still I was not altogether sorry: I thought the burden of directing and
warning would be more efficiently borne by him (<font color='blue'><b>Linton</b></font>) than me. But he (<font color='blue'><b>Linton</b></font>) was too
timid in giving satisfactory reasons for his (<font color='blue'><b>Linton</b></font>) wish that she (<font color='blue'><b>Linton</b></font>) should shun
connection with the household of the Heights, and Catherine liked good
reasons for every restraint that harassed her (<font color='blue'><b>Catherine</b></font>) petted will.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Papa!''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Catherine</b></font>) exclaimed, after the morning's salutations, `guess whom I saw
yesterday, in my walk on the moors. Ah, papa, you started! you've not
done right, have you, now? I saw--but listen, and you shall hear how I
found you out; and Ellen, who is in league with you, and yet pretended to
pity me so, when I kept hoping, and was always disappointed about
Linton's coming back!''

<p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>Linton</b></font>) gave a faithful account of her (<font color='blue'><b>Linton</b></font>) excursion and its consequences; and my
master, though he (<font color='blue'><b>master</b></font>) cast more than one reproachful look at me, said nothing
till she (<font color='blue'><b>Linton</b></font>) had concluded. Then he (<font color='blue'><b>master</b></font>) drew her (<font color='blue'><b>Linton</b></font>) to him (<font color='blue'><b>master</b></font>), and asked if she (<font color='blue'><b>Linton</b></font>) knew
why he (<font color='blue'><b>master</b></font>) had concealed Linton's near neighbourhood from her (<font color='blue'><b>Linton</b></font>)? Could she (<font color='blue'><b>Linton</b></font>)
think it was to deny her (<font color='blue'><b>Linton</b></font>) a pleasure that she (<font color='blue'><b>Linton</b></font>) might harmlessly enjoy?

<p/><div class="bookquote">``It was because you disliked Mr. Heathcliff,''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Linton</b></font>) answered.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Then you believe I care more for my own feelings than yours, Cathy?''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>master</b></font>)
said. <div class="bookquote">``No, it was not because I disliked Mr. Heathcliff, but because Mr.
Heathcliff dislikes me; and is a most diabolical man, delighting to wrong
and ruin those he (<font color='blue'><b>Heathcliff</b></font>) hates, if they give him (<font color='blue'><b>Heathcliff</b></font>) the slightest opportunity. I
knew that you could not keep up an acquaintance with your cousin without
being brought into contact with him (<font color='blue'><b>cousin</b></font>); and I knew he (<font color='blue'><b>cousin</b></font>) would detest you on my
account; so for your own good, and nothing else, I took precautions that
you should not see Linton again. I meant to explain this some time as
you grew older, and I'm sorry I delayed it.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``But Mr. Heathcliff was quite cordial, papa,''  (<font color='red'><b>Catherine/Earnshaw/Catherine Earnshaw</b></font>)</div>observed Catherine, not at
all convinced; `and he (<font color='blue'><b>master</b></font>) didn't object to our seeing each other: he (<font color='blue'><b>master</b></font>) said I
might come to his (<font color='blue'><b>master</b></font>) house when I pleased; only I must not tell you, because
you had quarrelled with him (<font color='blue'><b>master</b></font>), and would not forgive him (<font color='blue'><b>master</b></font>) for marrying aunt
Isabella. And you won't. _You_ are the one to be blamed: he (<font color='blue'><b>master</b></font>) is willing
to let us be friends, at least; Linton and I; and you are not.''

<p/>My master, perceiving that she (<font color='blue'><b>Linton</b></font>) would not take his (<font color='blue'><b>master</b></font>) word for her (<font color='blue'><b>Linton</b></font>)
uncle-in-law's evil disposition, gave a hasty sketch of his (<font color='blue'><b>master</b></font>) conduct to
Isabella, and the manner in which Wuthering Heights became his (<font color='blue'><b>master</b></font>) property.
He (<font color='blue'><b>master</b></font>) could not bear to discourse long upon the topic; for though he (<font color='blue'><b>master</b></font>) spoke
little of it, he (<font color='blue'><b>master</b></font>) still felt the same horror and detestation of his (<font color='blue'><b>master</b></font>)
ancient enemy that had occupied his (<font color='blue'><b>master</b></font>) heart ever since Mrs. Linton's
death. <div class="bookquote">``She (<font color='blue'><b>Linton</b></font>) might have been living yet, if it had not been for him (<font color='blue'><b>papa</b></font>)!''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>was
his (<font color='blue'><b>master</b></font>) constant bitter reflection; and, in his (<font color='blue'><b>master</b></font>) eyes, Heathcliff seemed a
murderer. Miss Cathy--conversant with no bad deeds except her (<font color='blue'><b>Cathy</b></font>) own slight
acts of disobedience, injustice, and passion, arising from hot temper
and thoughtlessness, and repented of on the day they were committed--was
amazed at the blackness of spirit that could brood on and cover revenge
for years, and deliberately prosecute its plans without a visitation of
remorse. She (<font color='blue'><b>Cathy</b></font>) appeared so deeply impressed and shocked at this new view
of human nature--excluded from all her (<font color='blue'><b>Cathy</b></font>) studies and all her (<font color='blue'><b>Cathy</b></font>) ideas till
now--that Mr. Edgar deemed it unnecessary to pursue the subject. He (<font color='blue'><b>Edgar</b></font>)
merely added: <div class="bookquote">``You will know hereafter, darling, why I wish you to avoid
his (<font color='blue'><b>papa</b></font>) house and family; now return to your old employments and amusements,
and think no more about them.''

 (<font color='red'><b>He</b></font>)</div><p/>Catherine kissed her (<font color='blue'><b>Catherine</b></font>) father, and sat down quietly to her (<font color='blue'><b>Catherine</b></font>) lessons for a
couple of hours, according to custom; then she (<font color='blue'><b>Catherine</b></font>) accompanied him (<font color='blue'><b>Edgar</b></font>) into the
grounds, and the whole day passed as usual: but in the evening, when she (<font color='blue'><b>Catherine</b></font>)
had retired to her (<font color='blue'><b>Catherine</b></font>) room, and I went to help her (<font color='blue'><b>Catherine</b></font>) to undress, I found her (<font color='blue'><b>Catherine</b></font>)
crying, on her (<font color='blue'><b>Catherine</b></font>) knees by the bedside.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Oh, fie, silly child!''  (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div>I exclaimed. <div class="bookquote">``If you had any real griefs you'd
be ashamed to waste a tear on this little contrariety. You never had one
shadow of substantial sorrow, Miss Catherine. Suppose, for a minute,
that master and I were dead, and you were by yourself in the world: how
would you feel, then? Compare the present occasion with such an
affliction as that, and be thankful for the friends you have, instead of
coveting more.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I'm not crying for myself, Ellen,''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Catherine</b></font>) answered, `it's for him (<font color='blue'><b>Edgar</b></font>). He (<font color='blue'><b>Edgar</b></font>)
expected to see me again to-morrow, and there he (<font color='blue'><b>Edgar</b></font>)'ll be so disappointed:
and he (<font color='blue'><b>Edgar</b></font>)'ll wait for me, and I sha'n't come!''

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Nonsense!''  (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div>said I, `do you imagine he (<font color='blue'><b>Edgar</b></font>) has thought as much of you as you
have of him (<font color='blue'><b>Edgar</b></font>)? Hasn't he (<font color='blue'><b>Edgar</b></font>) Hareton for a companion? Not one in a hundred
would weep at losing a relation they had just seen twice, for two
afternoons. Linton will conjecture how it is, and trouble himself no
further about you.''

<p/><div class="bookquote">``But may I not write a note to tell him (<font color='blue'><b>Ellen</b></font>) why I cannot come?''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Linton</b></font>) asked,
rising to her (<font color='blue'><b>Linton</b></font>) feet. <div class="bookquote">``And just send those books I promised to lend him (<font color='blue'><b>Ellen</b></font>)?
His (<font color='blue'><b>Ellen</b></font>) books are not as nice as mine, and he (<font color='blue'><b>Ellen</b></font>) wanted to have them extremely,
when I told him (<font color='blue'><b>Ellen</b></font>) how interesting they were. May I not, Ellen?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``No, indeed! no, indeed!''  (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div>replied I with decision. <div class="bookquote">``Then he (<font color='blue'><b>Ellen</b></font>) would write
to you, and there'd never be an end of it. No, Miss Catherine, the
acquaintance must be dropped entirely: so papa expects, and I shall see
that it is done.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``But how can one little note--?''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Linton</b></font>) recommenced, putting on an imploring
countenance.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Silence!''  (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div>I interrupted. <div class="bookquote">``We'll not begin with your little notes. Get
into bed.''

 (<font color='red'><b>She</b></font>)</div><p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>Linton</b></font>) threw at me a very naughty look, so naughty that I would not kiss her (<font color='blue'><b>Linton</b></font>)
good-night at first: I covered her (<font color='blue'><b>Linton</b></font>) up, and shut her (<font color='blue'><b>Linton</b></font>) door, in great
displeasure; but, repenting half-way, I returned softly, and lo! there
was Miss standing at the table with a bit of blank paper before her (<font color='blue'><b>Linton</b></font>) and a
pencil in her (<font color='blue'><b>Linton</b></font>) hand, which she (<font color='blue'><b>Linton</b></font>) guiltily slipped out of sight on my
entrance.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``You'll get nobody to take that, Catherine,''  (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div>I said, `if you write it;
and at present I shall put out your candle.''

<p/>I set the extinguisher on the flame, receiving as I did so a slap on my
hand and a petulant `cross thing!'' I then quitted her (<font color='blue'><b>Linton</b></font>) again, and she (<font color='blue'><b>Linton</b></font>)
drew the bolt in one of her (<font color='blue'><b>Linton</b></font>) worst, most peevish humours. The letter was
finished and forwarded to its destination by a milk-fetcher who came from
the village; but that I didn't learn till some time afterwards. Weeks
passed on, and Cathy recovered her (<font color='blue'><b>Cathy</b></font>) temper; though she (<font color='blue'><b>Cathy</b></font>) grew wondrous fond
of stealing off to corners by herself and often, if I came near her (<font color='blue'><b>Cathy</b></font>)
suddenly while reading, she (<font color='blue'><b>Cathy</b></font>) would start and bend over the book, evidently
desirous to hide it; and I detected edges of loose paper sticking out
beyond the leaves. She (<font color='blue'><b>Cathy</b></font>) also got a trick of coming down early in the
morning and lingering about the kitchen, as if she (<font color='blue'><b>Cathy</b></font>) were expecting the
arrival of something; and she (<font color='blue'><b>Cathy</b></font>) had a small drawer in a cabinet in the
library, which she (<font color='blue'><b>Cathy</b></font>) would trifle over for hours, and whose key she (<font color='blue'><b>Cathy</b></font>) took
special care to remove when she (<font color='blue'><b>Cathy</b></font>) left it.

<p/>One day, as she (<font color='blue'><b>Cathy</b></font>) inspected this drawer, I observed that the playthings and
trinkets which recently formed its contents were transmuted into bits of
folded paper. My curiosity and suspicions were roused; I determined to
take a peep at her (<font color='blue'><b>Cathy</b></font>) mysterious treasures; so, at night, as soon as she (<font color='blue'><b>Cathy</b></font>) and
my master were safe upstairs, I searched, and readily found among my
house keys one that would fit the lock. Having opened, I emptied the
whole contents into my apron, and took them with me to examine at leisure
in my own chamber. Though I could not but suspect, I was still surprised
to discover that they were a mass of correspondence--daily almost, it
must have been--from Linton Heathcliff: answers to documents forwarded by
her (<font color='blue'><b>Heathcliff</b></font>). The earlier dated were embarrassed and short; gradually, however,
they expanded into copious love-letters, foolish, as the age of the
writer rendered natural, yet with touches here and there which I thought
were borrowed from a more experienced source. Some of them struck me as
singularly odd compounds of ardour and flatness; commencing in strong
feeling, and concluding in the affected, wordy style that a schoolboy
might use to a fancied, incorporeal sweetheart. Whether they satisfied
Cathy I don't know; but they appeared very worthless trash to me. After
turning over as many as I thought proper, I tied them in a handkerchief
and set them aside, relocking the vacant drawer.

<p/>Following her (<font color='blue'><b>Cathy</b></font>) habit, my young lady descended early, and visited the
kitchen: I watched her (<font color='blue'><b>Cathy</b></font>) go to the door, on the arrival of a certain little
boy; and, while the dairymaid filled his (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>) can, she (<font color='blue'><b>Cathy</b></font>) tucked something into
his (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>) jacket pocket, and plucked something out. I went round by the
garden, and laid wait for the messenger; who fought valorously to defend
his (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>) trust, and we spilt the milk between us; but I succeeded in
abstracting the epistle; and, threatening serious consequences if he (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>) did
not look sharp home, I remained under the wall and perused Miss Cathy's
affectionate composition. It was more simple and more eloquent than her (<font color='blue'><b>Cathy</b></font>)
cousin's: very pretty and very silly. I shook my head, and went
meditating into the house. The day being wet, she (<font color='blue'><b>Cathy</b></font>) could not divert
herself with rambling about the park; so, at the conclusion of her (<font color='blue'><b>Cathy</b></font>)
morning studies, she (<font color='blue'><b>Cathy</b></font>) resorted to the solace of the drawer. Her (<font color='blue'><b>Cathy</b></font>) father
sat reading at the table; and I, on purpose, had sought a bit of work in
some unripped fringes of the window-curtain, keeping my eye steadily
fixed on her (<font color='blue'><b>Cathy</b></font>) proceedings. Never did any bird flying back to a plundered
nest, which it had left brimful of chirping young ones, express more
complete despair, in its anguished cries and flutterings, than she (<font color='blue'><b>Cathy</b></font>) by her (<font color='blue'><b>Cathy</b></font>)
single <div class="bookquote">``Oh!''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>and the change that transfigured her (<font color='blue'><b>Cathy</b></font>) late happy countenance.
Mr. Linton looked up.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``What is the matter, love? Have you hurt yourself?''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Linton</b></font>) said.

<p/>His (<font color='blue'><b>Linton</b></font>) tone and look assured her (<font color='blue'><b>Cathy</b></font>) _he (<font color='blue'><b>Linton</b></font>)_ had not been the discoverer of the
hoard.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``No, papa!''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Cathy</b></font>) gasped. <div class="bookquote">``Ellen! Ellen! come up-stairs--I'm sick!''

 (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div><p/>I obeyed her (<font color='blue'><b>Cathy</b></font>) summons, and accompanied her (<font color='blue'><b>Cathy</b></font>) out.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Oh, Ellen! you have got them,''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Cathy</b></font>) commenced immediately, dropping on
her (<font color='blue'><b>Cathy</b></font>) knees, when we were enclosed alone. <div class="bookquote">``Oh, give them to me, and I'll
never, never do so again! Don't tell papa. You have not told papa,
Ellen? say you have not? I've been exceedingly naughty, but I won't do
it any more!''

 (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div><p/>With a grave severity in my manner I bade her (<font color='blue'><b>Cathy</b></font>) stand up.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``So,''  (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div>I exclaimed, <div class="bookquote">``Miss Catherine, you are tolerably far on, it seems:
you may well be ashamed of them! A fine bundle of trash you study in
your leisure hours, to be sure: why, it's good enough to be printed! And
what do you suppose the master will think when I display it before him (<font color='blue'><b>master</b></font>)? I
hav'n't shown it yet, but you needn't imagine I shall keep your
ridiculous secrets. For shame! and you must have led the way in writing
such absurdities: he (<font color='blue'><b>master</b></font>) would not have thought of beginning, I'm certain.''

 (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div><p/>``I didn't! I didn``t!'' sobbed Cathy, fit to break her (<font color='blue'><b>Cathy</b></font>) heart. ``I didn't
once think of loving him (<font color='blue'><b>master</b></font>) till--'

<p/><div class="bookquote">''_Loving_!''  (<font color='red'><b>him</b></font>)</div>cried I, as scornfully as I could utter the word. '_Loving_!
Did anybody ever hear the like! I might just as well talk of loving the
miller who comes once a year to buy our corn. Pretty loving, indeed! and
both times together you have seen Linton hardly four hours in your life!
Now here is the babyish trash. I'm going with it to the library; and
we'll see what your father says to such _loving_.''

<p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>Linton</b></font>) sprang at her (<font color='blue'><b>Linton</b></font>) precious epistles, but I held them above my head; and
then she (<font color='blue'><b>Linton</b></font>) poured out further frantic entreaties that I would burn them--do
anything rather than show them. And being really fully as much inclined
to laugh as scold--for I esteemed it all girlish vanity--I at length
relented in a measure, and asked,--<div class="bookquote">``If I consent to burn them, will you
promise faithfully neither to send nor receive a letter again, nor a book
-LRB-for I perceive you have sent him (<font color='blue'><b>master</b></font>) books-RRB-, nor locks of hair, nor rings,
nor playthings?''

 (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``We don't send playthings,''  (<font color='red'><b>Catherine/Earnshaw/Catherine Earnshaw</b></font>)</div>cried Catherine, her (<font color='blue'><b>Catherine</b></font>) pride overcoming her (<font color='blue'><b>Catherine</b></font>)
shame.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Nor anything at all, then, my lady?''  (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div>I said. <div class="bookquote">``Unless you will, here I
go.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I promise, Ellen!''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Catherine</b></font>) cried, catching my dress. <div class="bookquote">``Oh, put them in the
fire, do, do!''

 (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div><p/>But when I proceeded to open a place with the poker the sacrifice was too
painful to be borne. She (<font color='blue'><b>Catherine</b></font>) earnestly supplicated that I would spare her (<font color='blue'><b>Catherine</b></font>)
one or two.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``One or two, Ellen, to keep for Linton's sake!''

 (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div><p/>I unknotted the handkerchief, and commenced dropping them in from an
angle, and the flame curled up the chimney.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``I will have one, you cruel wretch!''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Catherine</b></font>) screamed, darting her (<font color='blue'><b>Catherine</b></font>) hand into
the fire, and drawing forth some half-consumed fragments, at the expense
of her (<font color='blue'><b>Catherine</b></font>) fingers.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Very well--and I will have some to exhibit to papa!''  (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div>I answered,
shaking back the rest into the bundle, and turning anew to the door.

<p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>Catherine</b></font>) emptied her (<font color='blue'><b>Catherine</b></font>) blackened pieces into the flames, and motioned me to
finish the immolation. It was done; I stirred up the ashes, and interred
them under a shovelful of coals; and she (<font color='blue'><b>Catherine</b></font>) mutely, and with a sense of
intense injury, retired to her (<font color='blue'><b>Catherine</b></font>) private apartment. I descended to tell my
master that the young lady's qualm of sickness was almost gone, but I
judged it best for her (<font color='blue'><b>Catherine</b></font>) to lie down a while. She (<font color='blue'><b>Catherine</b></font>) wouldn't dine; but she (<font color='blue'><b>Catherine</b></font>)
reappeared at tea, pale, and red about the eyes, and marvellously subdued
in outward aspect. Next morning I answered the letter by a slip of
paper, inscribed, <div class="bookquote">``Master Heathcliff is requested to send no more notes
to Miss Linton, as she (<font color='blue'><b>Linton</b></font>) will not receive them.''  (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div>And, henceforth, the
little boy came with vacant pockets.




<p/>CHAPTER XXII


<p/>Summer drew to an end, and early autumn: it was past Michaelmas, but the
harvest was late that year, and a few of our fields were still uncleared.
Mr. Linton and his (<font color='blue'><b>Linton</b></font>) daughter would frequently walk out among the reapers;
at the carrying of the last sheaves they stayed till dusk, and the
evening happening to be chill and damp, my master caught a bad cold, that
settled obstinately on his (<font color='blue'><b>master</b></font>) lungs, and confined him (<font color='blue'><b>master</b></font>) indoors throughout the
whole of the winter, nearly without intermission.

<p/>Poor Cathy, frightened from her (<font color='blue'><b>Cathy</b></font>) little romance, had been considerably
sadder and duller since its abandonment; and her (<font color='blue'><b>Cathy</b></font>) father insisted on her (<font color='blue'><b>Cathy</b></font>)
reading less, and taking more exercise. She (<font color='blue'><b>Cathy</b></font>) had his (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) companionship no
longer; I esteemed it a duty to supply its lack, as much as possible,
with mine: an inefficient substitute; for I could only spare two or three
hours, from my numerous diurnal occupations, to follow her (<font color='blue'><b>Cathy</b></font>) footsteps, and
then my society was obviously less desirable than his (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>).

<p/>On an afternoon in October, or the beginning of November--a fresh watery
afternoon, when the turf and paths were rustling with moist, withered
leaves, and the cold blue sky was half hidden by clouds--dark grey
streamers, rapidly mounting from the west, and boding abundant rain--I
requested my young lady to forego her (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) ramble, because I was certain of
showers. She (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) refused; and I unwillingly donned a cloak, and took my
umbrella to accompany her (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) on a stroll to the bottom of the park: a formal
walk which she (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) generally affected if low-spirited--and that she (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>)
invariably was when Mr. Edgar had been worse than ordinary, a thing never
known from his (<font color='blue'><b>Edgar</b></font>) confession, but guessed both by her (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) and me from his (<font color='blue'><b>Edgar</b></font>)
increased silence and the melancholy of his (<font color='blue'><b>Edgar</b></font>) countenance. She (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) went sadly
on: there was no running or bounding now, though the chill wind might
well have tempted her (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) to race. And often, from the side of my eye, I
could detect her (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) raising a hand, and brushing something off her (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) cheek. I
gazed round for a means of diverting her (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) thoughts. On one side of the
road rose a high, rough bank, where hazels and stunted oaks, with their
roots half exposed, held uncertain tenure: the soil was too loose for the
latter; and strong winds had blown some nearly horizontal. In summer
Miss Catherine delighted to climb along these trunks, and sit in the
branches, swinging twenty feet above the ground; and I, pleased with her (<font color='blue'><b>Catherine</b></font>)
agility and her (<font color='blue'><b>Catherine</b></font>) light, childish heart, still considered it proper to
scold every time I caught her (<font color='blue'><b>Catherine</b></font>) at such an elevation, but so that she (<font color='blue'><b>Catherine</b></font>) knew
there was no necessity for descending. From dinner to tea she (<font color='blue'><b>Catherine</b></font>) would lie
in her (<font color='blue'><b>Catherine</b></font>) breeze-rocked cradle, doing nothing except singing old songs--my
nursery lore--to herself, or watching the birds, joint tenants, feed and
entice their young ones to fly: or nestling with closed lids, half
thinking, half dreaming, happier than words can express.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Look, Miss!''  (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div>I exclaimed, pointing to a nook under the roots of one
twisted tree. <div class="bookquote">``Winter is not here yet. There's a little flower up
yonder, the last bud from the multitude of bluebells that clouded those
turf steps in July with a lilac mist. Will you clamber up, and pluck it
to show to papa?''  (<font color='red'><b>Cathy/Miss Cathy</b></font>)</div>Cathy stared a long time at the lonely blossom
trembling in its earthy shelter, and replied, at length--<div class="bookquote">``No, I'll not
touch it: but it looks melancholy, does it not, Ellen?''

 (<font color='red'><b>Cathy/Miss Cathy</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Yes,''  (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div>I observed, `about as starved and suckless as you: your cheeks are
bloodless; let us take hold of hands and run. You're so low, I daresay I
shall keep up with you.''

<p/><div class="bookquote">``No,''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Cathy</b></font>) repeated, and continued sauntering on, pausing at intervals to
muse over a bit of moss, or a tuft of blanched grass, or a fungus
spreading its bright orange among the heaps of brown foliage; and, ever
and anon, her (<font color='blue'><b>Cathy</b></font>) hand was lifted to her (<font color='blue'><b>Cathy</b></font>) averted face.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Catherine, why are you crying, love?''  (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div>I asked, approaching and putting
my arm over her (<font color='blue'><b>Cathy</b></font>) shoulder. <div class="bookquote">``You mustn't cry because papa has a cold; be
thankful it is nothing worse.''

 (<font color='red'><b>She</b></font>)</div><p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>Cathy</b></font>) now put no further restraint on her (<font color='blue'><b>Cathy</b></font>) tears; her (<font color='blue'><b>Cathy</b></font>) breath was stifled by
sobs.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Oh, it will be something worse,''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Cathy</b></font>) said. <div class="bookquote">``And what shall I do when
papa and you leave me, and I am by myself? I can't forget your words,
Ellen; they are always in my ear. How life will be changed, how dreary
the world will be, when papa and you are dead.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``None can tell whether you won't die before us,''  (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div>I replied. <div class="bookquote">``It's wrong
to anticipate evil. We'll hope there are years and years to come before
any of us go: master is young, and I am strong, and hardly forty-five. My
mother lived till eighty, a canty dame to the last. And suppose Mr.
Linton were spared till he (<font color='blue'><b>Linton</b></font>) saw sixty, that would be more years than you
have counted, Miss.. And would it not be foolish to mourn a calamity
above twenty years beforehand?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``But Aunt Isabella was younger than papa,''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Cathy</b></font>) remarked, gazing up with
timid hope to seek further consolation.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Aunt Isabella had not you and me to nurse her (<font color='blue'><b>Isabella</b></font>),''  (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div>I replied. <div class="bookquote">``She (<font color='blue'><b>Isabella</b></font>) wasn't
as happy as Master: she (<font color='blue'><b>Isabella</b></font>) hadn't as much to live for. All you need do, is
to wait well on your father, and cheer him (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) by letting him (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) see you
cheerful; and avoid giving him (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) anxiety on any subject: mind that, Cathy!
I'll not disguise but you might kill him (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) if you were wild and reckless,
and cherished a foolish, fanciful affection for the son of a person who
would be glad to have him (<font color='blue'><b>son</b></font>) in his (<font color='blue'><b>son</b></font>) grave; and allowed him (<font color='blue'><b>son</b></font>) to discover that
you fretted over the separation he (<font color='blue'><b>son</b></font>) has judged it expedient to make.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I fret about nothing on earth except papa's illness,''  (<font color='red'><b>companion</b></font>)</div>answered my
companion. <div class="bookquote">``I care for nothing in comparison with papa. And I'll
never--never--oh, never, while I have my senses, do an act or say a word
to vex him (<font color='blue'><b>papa</b></font>). I love him (<font color='blue'><b>papa</b></font>) better than myself, Ellen; and I know it by this:
I pray every night that I may live after him (<font color='blue'><b>papa</b></font>); because I would rather be
miserable than that he (<font color='blue'><b>papa</b></font>) should be: that proves I love him (<font color='blue'><b>papa</b></font>) better than
myself.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Good words,''  (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div>I replied. <div class="bookquote">``But deeds must prove it also; and after he (<font color='blue'><b>papa</b></font>) is
well, remember you don't forget resolutions formed in the hour of fear.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/>As we talked, we neared a door that opened on the road; and my young
lady, lightening into sunshine again, climbed up and seated herself on
the top of the wall, reaching over to gather some hips that bloomed
scarlet on the summit branches of the wild-rose trees shadowing the
highway side: the lower fruit had disappeared, but only birds could touch
the upper, except from Cathy's present station. In stretching to pull
them, her (<font color='blue'><b>Cathy</b></font>) hat fell off; and as the door was locked, she (<font color='blue'><b>Cathy</b></font>) proposed
scrambling down to recover it. I bid her (<font color='blue'><b>Cathy</b></font>) be cautious lest she (<font color='blue'><b>Cathy</b></font>) got a
fall, and she (<font color='blue'><b>Cathy</b></font>) nimbly disappeared. But the return was no such easy
matter: the stones were smooth and neatly cemented, and the rose-bushes
and black-berry stragglers could yield no assistance in re-ascending. I,
like a fool, didn't recollect that, till I heard her (<font color='blue'><b>Cathy</b></font>) laughing and
exclaiming--<div class="bookquote">``Ellen! you'll have to fetch the key, or else I must run
round to the porter's lodge. I can't scale the ramparts on this side!''

 (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Stay where you are,''  (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div>I answered; <div class="bookquote">``I have my bundle of keys in my pocket:
perhaps I may manage to open it; if not, I'll go.''

 (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div><p/>Catherine amused herself with dancing to and fro before the door, while I
tried all the large keys in succession. I had applied the last, and
found that none would do; so, repeating my desire that she (<font color='blue'><b>Catherine</b></font>) would remain
there, I was about to hurry home as fast as I could, when an approaching
sound arrested me. It was the trot of a horse; Cathy's dance stopped
also.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Who is that?''  (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div>I whispered.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Ellen, I wish you could open the door,''  (<font color='red'><b>companion</b></font>)</div>whispered back my companion,
anxiously.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Ho, Miss Linton!''  (<font color='red'><b>the rider</b></font>)</div>cried a deep voice -LRB-the rider's-RRB-, <div class="bookquote">``I'm glad to meet
you. Don't be in haste to enter, for I have an explanation to ask and
obtain.''

 (<font color='red'><b>the rider</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I sha'n't speak to you, Mr. Heathcliff,''  (<font color='red'><b>Catherine/Earnshaw/Catherine Earnshaw</b></font>)</div>answered Catherine. <div class="bookquote">``Papa says
you are a wicked man, and you hate both him (<font color='blue'><b>Papa</b></font>) and me; and Ellen says the
same.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``That is nothing to the purpose,''  (<font color='red'><b>Heathcliff/Mr. Heathcliff</b></font>)</div>said Heathcliff. -LRB-He (<font color='blue'><b>Heathcliff</b></font>) it was.-RRB- <div class="bookquote">``I
don't hate my son, I suppose; and it is concerning him (<font color='blue'><b>son</b></font>) that I demand your
attention. Yes; you have cause to blush. Two or three months since,
were you not in the habit of writing to Linton? making love in play, eh?
You deserved, both of you, flogging for that! You especially, the elder;
and less sensitive, as it turns out. I've got your letters, and if you
give me any pertness I'll send them to your father. I presume you grew
weary of the amusement and dropped it, didn't you? Well, you dropped
Linton with it into a Slough of Despond. He (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) was in earnest: in love,
really. As true as I live, he (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>)'s dying for you; breaking his (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) heart at
your fickleness: not figuratively, but actually. Though Hareton has made
him (<font color='blue'><b>Hareton</b></font>) a standing jest for six weeks, and I have used more serious measures,
and attempted to frighten him (<font color='blue'><b>Hareton</b></font>) out of his (<font color='blue'><b>Hareton</b></font>) idiotcy, he (<font color='blue'><b>Hareton</b></font>) gets worse daily;
and he (<font color='blue'><b>Hareton</b></font>)'ll be under the sod before summer, unless you restore him (<font color='blue'><b>Hareton</b></font>)!''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``How can you lie so glaringly to the poor child?''  (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div>I called from the
inside. <div class="bookquote">``Pray ride on! How can you deliberately get up such paltry
falsehoods? Miss Cathy, I'll knock the lock off with a stone: you won't
believe that vile nonsense. You can feel in yourself it is impossible
that a person should die for love of a stranger.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I was not aware there were eavesdroppers,''  (<font color='red'><b>the villain</b></font>)</div>muttered the detected
villain. <div class="bookquote">``Worthy Mrs. Dean, I like you, but I don't like your
double-dealing,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>villain</b></font>) added aloud. ``How could _you_ lie so glaringly as to
affirm I hated the ``poor child<div class="bookquote">''? and invent bugbear stories to terrify
her (<font color='blue'><b>Catherine</b></font>) from my door-stones? Catherine Linton -LRB-the very name warms me-RRB-, my
bonny lass, I shall be from home all this week; go and see if have not
spoken truth: do, there's a darling! Just imagine your father in my
place, and Linton in yours; then think how you would value your careless
lover if he (<font color='blue'><b>lover</b></font>) refused to stir a step to comfort you, when your father
himself entreated him (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>); and don't, from pure stupidity, fall into the
same error. I swear, on my salvation, he (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>)'s going to his (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) grave, and none
but you can save him (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>)!''

 (<font color='red'><b>the child</b></font>)</div><p/>The lock gave way and I issued out.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``I swear Linton is dying,''  (<font color='red'><b>Heathcliff/Mr. Heathcliff</b></font>)</div>repeated Heathcliff, looking hard at me. <div class="bookquote">``And
grief and disappointment are hastening his (<font color='blue'><b>stranger</b></font>) death. Nelly, if you won't
let her (<font color='blue'><b>Linton</b></font>) go, you can walk over yourself. But I shall not return till this
time next week; and I think your master himself would scarcely object to
her (<font color='blue'><b>Linton</b></font>) visiting her (<font color='blue'><b>Linton</b></font>) cousin.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Come in,''  (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div>said I, taking Cathy by the arm and half forcing her (<font color='blue'><b>Cathy</b></font>) to
re-enter; for she (<font color='blue'><b>Cathy</b></font>) lingered, viewing with troubled eyes the features of
the speaker, too stern to express his (<font color='blue'><b>speaker</b></font>) inward deceit.

<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>speaker</b></font>) pushed his (<font color='blue'><b>speaker</b></font>) horse close, and, bending down, observed--<div class="bookquote">``Miss Catherine,
I'll own to you that I have little patience with Linton; and Hareton and
Joseph have less. I'll own that he (<font color='blue'><b>Joseph</b></font>)'s with a harsh set. He (<font color='blue'><b>Joseph</b></font>) pines for
kindness, as well as love; and a kind word from you would be his (<font color='blue'><b>Joseph</b></font>) best
medicine. Don't mind Mrs. Dean's cruel cautions; but be generous, and
contrive to see him (<font color='blue'><b>Joseph</b></font>). He (<font color='blue'><b>Joseph</b></font>) dreams of you day and night, and cannot be
persuaded that you don't hate him (<font color='blue'><b>Joseph</b></font>), since you neither write nor call.''

 (<font color='red'><b>He</b></font>)</div><p/>I closed the door, and rolled a stone to assist the loosened lock in
holding it; and spreading my umbrella, I drew my charge underneath: for
the rain began to drive through the moaning branches of the trees, and
warned us to avoid delay. Our hurry prevented any comment on the
encounter with Heathcliff, as we stretched towards home; but I divined
instinctively that Catherine's heart was clouded now in double darkness.
Her (<font color='blue'><b>Catherine</b></font>) features were so sad, they did not seem hers: she (<font color='blue'><b>Catherine</b></font>) evidently regarded
what she (<font color='blue'><b>Catherine</b></font>) had heard as every syllable true.

<p/>The master had retired to rest before we came in. Cathy stole to his (<font color='blue'><b>master</b></font>)
room to inquire how he (<font color='blue'><b>master</b></font>) was; he (<font color='blue'><b>master</b></font>) had fallen asleep. She (<font color='blue'><b>Cathy</b></font>) returned, and
asked me to sit with her (<font color='blue'><b>Cathy</b></font>) in the library. We took our tea together; and
afterwards she (<font color='blue'><b>Cathy</b></font>) lay down on the rug, and told me not to talk, for she (<font color='blue'><b>Cathy</b></font>) was
weary. I got a book, and pretended to read. As soon as she (<font color='blue'><b>Cathy</b></font>) supposed me
absorbed in my occupation, she (<font color='blue'><b>Cathy</b></font>) recommenced her (<font color='blue'><b>Cathy</b></font>) silent weeping: it
appeared, at present, her (<font color='blue'><b>Cathy</b></font>) favourite diversion. I suffered her (<font color='blue'><b>Cathy</b></font>) to enjoy
it a while; then I expostulated: deriding and ridiculing all Mr.
Heathcliff's assertions about his (<font color='blue'><b>Heathcliff</b></font>) son, as if I were certain she (<font color='blue'><b>Cathy</b></font>) would
coincide. Alas! I hadn't skill to counteract the effect his (<font color='blue'><b>Heathcliff</b></font>) account had
produced: it was just what he (<font color='blue'><b>Heathcliff</b></font>) intended.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``You may be right, Ellen,''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Cathy</b></font>) answered; `but I shall never feel at ease
till I know. And I must tell Linton it is not my fault that I don't
write, and convince him (<font color='blue'><b>Heathcliff</b></font>) that I shall not change.''

<p/>What use were anger and protestations against her (<font color='blue'><b>Linton</b></font>) silly credulity? We
parted that night--hostile; but next day beheld me on the road to
Wuthering Heights, by the side of my wilful young mistress's pony. I
couldn't bear to witness her (<font color='blue'><b>mistress</b></font>) sorrow: to see her (<font color='blue'><b>mistress</b></font>) pale, dejected
countenance, and heavy eyes: and I yielded, in the faint hope that Linton
himself might prove, by his (<font color='blue'><b>witness</b></font>) reception of us, how little of the tale was
founded on fact.




<p/>CHAPTER XXIII


<p/>The rainy night had ushered in a misty morning--half frost, half
drizzle--and temporary brooks crossed our path--gurgling from the
uplands. My feet were thoroughly wetted; I was cross and low; exactly
the humour suited for making the most of these disagreeable things. We
entered the farm-house by the kitchen way, to ascertain whether Mr.
Heathcliff were really absent: because I put slight faith in his (<font color='blue'><b>Heathcliff</b></font>) own
affirmation.

<p/>Joseph seemed sitting in a sort of elysium alone, beside a roaring fire;
a quart of ale on the table near him (<font color='blue'><b>Joseph</b></font>), bristling with large pieces of
toasted oat-cake; and his (<font color='blue'><b>Joseph</b></font>) black, short pipe in his (<font color='blue'><b>Joseph</b></font>) mouth. Catherine ran
to the hearth to warm herself. I asked if the master was in? My
question remained so long unanswered, that I thought the old man had
grown deaf, and repeated it louder.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Na--ay!''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) snarled, or rather screamed through his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) nose. <div class="bookquote">``Na--ay! yah
muh goa back whear yah coom frough.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Joseph!''  (<font color='red'><b>me</b></font>)</div>cried a peevish voice, simultaneously with me, from the inner
room. <div class="bookquote">``How often am I to call you? There are only a few red ashes now.
Joseph! come this moment.''

 (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div><p/>Vigorous puffs, and a resolute stare into the grate, declared he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) had no
ear for this appeal. The housekeeper and Hareton were invisible; one
gone on an errand, and the other at his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) work, probably. We knew Linton's
tones, and entered.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Oh, I hope you'll die in a garret, starved to death!''  (<font color='red'><b>the boy</b></font>)</div>said the boy,
mistaking our approach for that of his (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>) negligent attendant.

<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>) stopped on observing his (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>) error: his (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>) cousin flew to him (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>).

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Is that you, Miss Linton?''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>) said, raising his (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>) head from the arm of the
great chair, in which he (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>) reclined. <div class="bookquote">``No--don't kiss me: it takes my
breath. Dear me! Papa said you would call,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>continued he (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>), after
recovering a little from Catherine's embrace; while she (<font color='blue'><b>Catherine</b></font>) stood by looking
very contrite. <div class="bookquote">``Will you shut the door, if you please? you left it open;
and those--those _detestable_ creatures won't bring coals to the fire.
It's so cold!''

 (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div><p/>I stirred up the cinders, and fetched a scuttleful myself. The invalid
complained of being covered with ashes; but he (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>) had a tiresome cough, and
looked feverish and ill, so I did not rebuke his (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>) temper.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Well, Linton,''  (<font color='red'><b>Catherine/Earnshaw/Catherine Earnshaw</b></font>)</div>murmured Catherine, when his (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>) corrugated brow relaxed,
`are you glad to see me? Can I do you any good?''

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Why didn't you come before?''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>) asked. <div class="bookquote">``You should have come, instead
of writing. It tired me dreadfully writing those long letters. I'd far
rather have talked to you. Now, I can neither bear to talk, nor anything
else. I wonder where Zillah is! Will you' -LRB-looking at me-RRB- `step into
the kitchen and see?''

 (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div><p/>I had received no thanks for my other service; and being unwilling to run
to and fro at his (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>) behest, I replied--<div class="bookquote">``Nobody is out there but Joseph.''

 (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I want to drink,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>) exclaimed fretfully, turning away. <div class="bookquote">``Zillah is
constantly gadding off to Gimmerton since papa went: it's miserable! And
I'm obliged to come down here--they resolved never to hear me up-stairs.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Is your father attentive to you, Master Heathcliff?''  (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div>I asked, perceiving
Catherine to be checked in her (<font color='blue'><b>Catherine</b></font>) friendly advances.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Attentive? He (<font color='blue'><b>Master</b></font>) makes them a little more attentive at least,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>) cried.
<div class="bookquote">``The wretches! Do you know, Miss Linton, that brute Hareton laughs at
me! I hate him (<font color='blue'><b>Master</b></font>)! indeed, I hate them all: they are odious beings.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Cathy/Miss Cathy</b></font>)</div><p/>Cathy began searching for some water; she (<font color='blue'><b>Cathy</b></font>) lighted on a pitcher in the
dresser, filled a tumbler, and brought it. He (<font color='blue'><b>pitcher</b></font>) bid her (<font color='blue'><b>Cathy</b></font>) add a spoonful of
wine from a bottle on the table; and having swallowed a small portion,
appeared more tranquil, and said she (<font color='blue'><b>Cathy</b></font>) was very kind.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``And are you glad to see me?''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>asked she (<font color='blue'><b>Cathy</b></font>), reiterating her (<font color='blue'><b>Cathy</b></font>) former question
and pleased to detect the faint dawn of a smile.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Yes, I am. It's something new to hear a voice like yours!''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>pitcher</b></font>) replied.
<div class="bookquote">``But I have been vexed, because you wouldn't come. And papa swore it was
owing to me: he (<font color='blue'><b>papa</b></font>) called me a pitiful, shuffling, worthless thing; and said
you despised me; and if he (<font color='blue'><b>papa</b></font>) had been in my place, he (<font color='blue'><b>papa</b></font>) would be more the
master of the Grange than your father by this time. But you don't
despise me, do you, Miss--?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I wish you would say Catherine, or Cathy,''  (<font color='red'><b>lady</b></font>)</div>interrupted my young lady.
<div class="bookquote">``Despise you? No! Next to papa and Ellen, I love you better than
anybody living. I don't love Mr. Heathcliff, though; and I dare not come
when he (<font color='blue'><b>Heathcliff</b></font>) returns: will he (<font color='blue'><b>Heathcliff</b></font>) stay away many days?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Not many,''  (<font color='red'><b>Linton/Mrs. Linton/Mrs. Heathcliff</b></font>)</div>answered Linton; `but he (<font color='blue'><b>pitcher</b></font>) goes on to the moors frequently,
since the shooting season commenced; and you might spend an hour or two
with me in his (<font color='blue'><b>pitcher</b></font>) absence. Do say you will. I think I should not be
peevish with you: you'd not provoke me, and you'd always be ready to help
me, wouldn't you?''

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Yes,''  (<font color='red'><b>Catherine/Earnshaw/Catherine Earnshaw</b></font>)</div>said Catherine, stroking his (<font color='blue'><b>pitcher</b></font>) long soft hair: `if I could only get
papa's consent, I'd spend half my time with you. Pretty Linton! I wish
you were my brother.''

<p/><div class="bookquote">``And then you would like me as well as your father?''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>observed he (<font color='blue'><b>brother</b></font>), more
cheerfully. <div class="bookquote">``But papa says you would love me better than him (<font color='blue'><b>papa</b></font>) and all the
world, if you were my wife; so I'd rather you were that.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``No, I should never love anybody better than papa,''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Linton</b></font>) returned gravely.
<div class="bookquote">``And people hate their wives, sometimes; but not their sisters and
brothers: and if you were the latter, you would live with us, and papa
would be as fond of you as he (<font color='blue'><b>papa</b></font>) is of me.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Linton/Mrs. Linton/Mrs. Heathcliff</b></font>)</div><p/>Linton denied that people ever hated their wives; but Cathy affirmed they
did, and, in her (<font color='blue'><b>Cathy</b></font>) wisdom, instanced his (<font color='blue'><b>brother</b></font>) own father's aversion to her (<font color='blue'><b>Cathy</b></font>) aunt.
I endeavoured to stop her (<font color='blue'><b>Cathy</b></font>) thoughtless tongue. I couldn't succeed till
everything she (<font color='blue'><b>Cathy</b></font>) knew was out. Master Heathcliff, much irritated, asserted
her (<font color='blue'><b>Cathy</b></font>) relation was false.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Papa told me; and papa does not tell falsehoods,''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Cathy</b></font>) answered pertly.

<p/>'_My_ papa scorns yours!'' cried Linton. <div class="bookquote">``He (<font color='blue'><b>papa</b></font>) calls him (<font color='blue'><b>papa</b></font>) a sneaking fool.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Yours is a wicked man,''  (<font color='red'><b>Catherine/Earnshaw/Catherine Earnshaw</b></font>)</div>retorted Catherine; `and you are very naughty to
dare to repeat what he (<font color='blue'><b>papa</b></font>) says. He (<font color='blue'><b>papa</b></font>) must be wicked to have made Aunt
Isabella leave him (<font color='blue'><b>papa</b></font>) as she (<font color='blue'><b>Isabella</b></font>) did.''

<p/><div class="bookquote">``She (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>) didn't leave him (<font color='blue'><b>papa</b></font>),''  (<font color='red'><b>the boy</b></font>)</div>said the boy; `you sha'n't contradict me.''

<p/><div class="bookquote">``She (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>) did,''  (<font color='red'><b>lady</b></font>)</div>cried my young lady.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Well, I'll tell you something!''  (<font color='red'><b>Linton/Mrs. Linton/Mrs. Heathcliff</b></font>)</div>said Linton. <div class="bookquote">``Your mother hated your
father: now then.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Oh!''  (<font color='red'><b>Catherine/Earnshaw/Catherine Earnshaw</b></font>)</div>exclaimed Catherine, too enraged to continue.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``And she (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) loved mine,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>added he (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>).

<p/><div class="bookquote">``You little liar! I hate you now!''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Linton</b></font>) panted, and her (<font color='blue'><b>Linton</b></font>) face grew red
with passion.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``She (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) did! she (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) did!''  (<font color='red'><b>Linton/Mrs. Linton/Mrs. Heathcliff</b></font>)</div>sang Linton, sinking into the recess of his (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>) chair,
and leaning back his (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>) head to enjoy the agitation of the other disputant,
who stood behind.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Hush, Master Heathcliff!''  (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div>I said; `that's your father's tale, too, I
suppose.''

<p/><div class="bookquote">``It isn't: you hold your tongue!''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) answered. <div class="bookquote">``She (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) did, she (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) did,
Catherine! she (<font color='blue'><b>Catherine</b></font>) did, she (<font color='blue'><b>Catherine</b></font>) did!''

 (<font color='red'><b>Cathy/Miss Cathy</b></font>)</div><p/>Cathy, beside herself, gave the chair a violent push, and caused him (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) to
fall against one arm. He (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) was immediately seized by a suffocating cough
that soon ended his (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) triumph. It lasted so long that it frightened even
me. As to his (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) cousin, she (<font color='blue'><b>Cathy</b></font>) wept with all her (<font color='blue'><b>Cathy</b></font>) might, aghast at the
mischief she (<font color='blue'><b>Cathy</b></font>) had done: though she (<font color='blue'><b>Cathy</b></font>) said nothing. I held him (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) till the fit
exhausted itself. Then he (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) thrust me away, and leant his (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) head down
silently. Catherine quelled her (<font color='blue'><b>Catherine</b></font>) lamentations also, took a seat opposite,
and looked solemnly into the fire.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``How do you feel now, Master Heathcliff?''  (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div>I inquired, after waiting ten
minutes.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``I wish _she (<font color='blue'><b>Catherine</b></font>)_ felt as I do,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) replied: `spiteful, cruel thing! Hareton
never touches me: he (<font color='blue'><b>Hareton</b></font>) never struck me in his (<font color='blue'><b>Hareton</b></font>) life. And I was better
to-day: and there--' his (<font color='blue'><b>Hareton</b></font>) voice died in a whimper.

<p/>'_I_ didn't strike you!'' muttered Cathy, chewing her (<font color='blue'><b>Cathy</b></font>) lip to prevent
another burst of emotion.

<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>lip</b></font>) sighed and moaned like one under great suffering, and kept it up for a
quarter of an hour; on purpose to distress his (<font color='blue'><b>lip</b></font>) cousin apparently, for
whenever he (<font color='blue'><b>lip</b></font>) caught a stifled sob from her (<font color='blue'><b>Cathy</b></font>) he (<font color='blue'><b>lip</b></font>) put renewed pain and pathos
into the inflexions of his (<font color='blue'><b>lip</b></font>) voice.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``I'm sorry I hurt you, Linton,''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Cathy</b></font>) said at length, racked beyond
endurance. <div class="bookquote">``But I couldn't have been hurt by that little push, and I had
no idea that you could, either: you're not much, are you, Linton? Don't
let me go home thinking I've done you harm. Answer! speak to me.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I can't speak to you,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>lip</b></font>) murmured; `you've hurt me so that I shall lie
awake all night choking with this cough. If you had it you'd know what
it was; but _you'll_ be comfortably asleep while I'm in agony, and nobody
near me. I wonder how you would like to pass those fearful nights!'' And
he (<font color='blue'><b>lip</b></font>) began to wail aloud, for very pity of himself.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Since you are in the habit of passing dreadful nights,''  (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div>I said, `it
won't be Miss who spoils your ease: you'd be the same had she (<font color='blue'><b>it</b></font>) never come.
However, she (<font color='blue'><b>it</b></font>) shall not disturb you again; and perhaps you'll get quieter
when we leave you.''

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Must I go?''  (<font color='red'><b>Catherine/Earnshaw/Catherine Earnshaw</b></font>)</div>asked Catherine dolefully, bending over him (<font color='blue'><b>lip</b></font>). <div class="bookquote">``Do you want
me to go, Linton?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``You can't alter what you've done,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>lip</b></font>) replied pettishly, shrinking from
her (<font color='blue'><b>Catherine</b></font>), `unless you alter it for the worse by teasing me into a fever.''

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Well, then, I must go?''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Catherine</b></font>) repeated.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Let me alone, at least,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>said he (<font color='blue'><b>lip</b></font>); <div class="bookquote">``I can't bear your talking.''

 (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div><p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>Catherine</b></font>) lingered, and resisted my persuasions to departure a tiresome while;
but as he (<font color='blue'><b>lip</b></font>) neither looked up nor spoke, she (<font color='blue'><b>Catherine</b></font>) finally made a movement to the
door, and I followed. We were recalled by a scream. Linton had slid
from his (<font color='blue'><b>lip</b></font>) seat on to the hearthstone, and lay writhing in the mere
perverseness of an indulged plague of a child, determined to be as
grievous and harassing as it can. I thoroughly gauged his (<font color='blue'><b>lip</b></font>) disposition
from his (<font color='blue'><b>lip</b></font>) behaviour, and saw at once it would be folly to attempt
humouring him (<font color='blue'><b>lip</b></font>). Not so my companion: she (<font color='blue'><b>Linton</b></font>) ran back in terror, knelt down,
and cried, and soothed, and entreated, till he (<font color='blue'><b>companion</b></font>) grew quiet from lack of
breath: by no means from compunction at distressing her (<font color='blue'><b>Linton</b></font>).

<p/><div class="bookquote">``I shall lift him (<font color='blue'><b>I</b></font>) on to the settle,''  (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div>I said, `and he (<font color='blue'><b>companion</b></font>) may roll about as he (<font color='blue'><b>companion</b></font>)
pleases: we can't stop to watch him (<font color='blue'><b>companion</b></font>). I hope you are satisfied, Miss
Cathy, that you are not the person to benefit him (<font color='blue'><b>companion</b></font>); and that his (<font color='blue'><b>companion</b></font>) condition
of health is not occasioned by attachment to you. Now, then, there he (<font color='blue'><b>companion</b></font>)
is! Come away: as soon as he (<font color='blue'><b>companion</b></font>) knows there is nobody by to care for his (<font color='blue'><b>companion</b></font>)
nonsense, he (<font color='blue'><b>companion</b></font>)'ll be glad to lie still.''

<p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>Cathy</b></font>) placed a cushion under his (<font color='blue'><b>companion</b></font>) head, and offered him (<font color='blue'><b>companion</b></font>) some water; he (<font color='blue'><b>companion</b></font>)
rejected the latter, and tossed uneasily on the former, as if it were a
stone or a block of wood. She (<font color='blue'><b>Cathy</b></font>) tried to put it more comfortably.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``I can't do with that,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>companion</b></font>) said; `it's not high enough.''

<p/>Catherine brought another to lay above it.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``That's too high,''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>murmured the provoking thing.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``How must I arrange it, then?''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Catherine</b></font>) asked despairingly.

<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>companion</b></font>) twined himself up to her (<font color='blue'><b>Catherine</b></font>), as she (<font color='blue'><b>Catherine</b></font>) half knelt by the settle, and
converted her (<font color='blue'><b>Catherine</b></font>) shoulder into a support.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``No, that won't do,''  (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div>I said. <div class="bookquote">``You'll be content with the cushion, Master
Heathcliff. Miss has wasted too much time on you already: we cannot
remain five minutes longer.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Yes, yes, we can!''  (<font color='red'><b>Cathy/Miss Cathy</b></font>)</div>replied Cathy. <div class="bookquote">``He (<font color='blue'><b>Heathcliff</b></font>)'s good and patient now. He (<font color='blue'><b>Heathcliff</b></font>)'s
beginning to think I shall have far greater misery than he (<font color='blue'><b>Heathcliff</b></font>) will to-night,
if I believe he (<font color='blue'><b>Heathcliff</b></font>) is the worse for my visit: and then I dare not come
again. Tell the truth about it, Linton; for I musn't come, if I have
hurt you.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``You must come, to cure me,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>companion</b></font>) answered. <div class="bookquote">``You ought to come, because
you have hurt me: you know you have extremely! I was not as ill when you
entered as I am at present--was I?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``But you've made yourself ill by crying and being in a passion.--I didn't
do it all,''  (<font color='red'><b>cousin</b></font>)</div>said his (<font color='blue'><b>companion</b></font>) cousin. <div class="bookquote">``However, we'll be friends now. And you
want me: you would wish to see me sometimes, really?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I told you I did,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>companion</b></font>) replied impatiently. <div class="bookquote">``Sit on the settle and let
me lean on your knee. That's as mamma used to do, whole afternoons
together. Sit quite still and don't talk: but you may sing a song, if
you can sing; or you may say a nice long interesting ballad--one of those
you promised to teach me; or a story. I'd rather have a ballad, though:
begin.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Catherine/Earnshaw/Catherine Earnshaw</b></font>)</div><p/>Catherine repeated the longest she (<font color='blue'><b>Catherine</b></font>) could remember. The employment
pleased both mightily. Linton would have another, and after that
another, notwithstanding my strenuous objections; and so they went on
until the clock struck twelve, and we heard Hareton in the court,
returning for his (<font color='blue'><b>Hareton</b></font>) dinner.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``And to-morrow, Catherine, will you be here to-morrow?''  (<font color='red'><b>Heathcliff/Mr. Heathcliff</b></font>)</div>asked young
Heathcliff, holding her (<font color='blue'><b>Linton</b></font>) frock as she (<font color='blue'><b>Linton</b></font>) rose reluctantly.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``No,''  (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div>I answered, `nor next day neither.'' She (<font color='blue'><b>Linton</b></font>), however, gave a different
response evidently, for his (<font color='blue'><b>Hareton</b></font>) forehead cleared as she (<font color='blue'><b>Linton</b></font>) stooped and whispered
in his (<font color='blue'><b>Hareton</b></font>) ear.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``You won't go to-morrow, recollect, Miss!''  (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div>I commenced, when we were out
of the house. <div class="bookquote">``You are not dreaming of it, are you?''

 (<font color='red'><b>She</b></font>)</div><p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>Linton</b></font>) smiled.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Oh, I'll take good care,''  (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div>I continued: <div class="bookquote">``I'll have that lock mended, and
you can escape by no way else.''

 (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I can get over the wall,''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Linton</b></font>) said laughing. <div class="bookquote">``The Grange is not a
prison, Ellen, and you are not my gaoler. And besides, I'm almost
seventeen: I'm a woman. And I'm certain Linton would recover quickly if
he (<font color='blue'><b>I</b></font>) had me to look after him (<font color='blue'><b>I</b></font>). I'm older than he (<font color='blue'><b>I</b></font>) is, you know, and wiser:
less childish, am I not? And he (<font color='blue'><b>I</b></font>)'ll soon do as I direct him (<font color='blue'><b>I</b></font>), with some
slight coaxing. He (<font color='blue'><b>I</b></font>)'s a pretty little darling when he (<font color='blue'><b>I</b></font>)'s good. I'd make
such a pet of him (<font color='blue'><b>I</b></font>), if he (<font color='blue'><b>I</b></font>) were mine. We should never quarrel, should we
after we were used to each other? Don't you like him (<font color='blue'><b>I</b></font>), Ellen?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Like him (<font color='blue'><b>I</b></font>)!''  (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div>I exclaimed. <div class="bookquote">``The worst-tempered bit of a sickly slip that
ever struggled into its teens. Happily, as Mr. Heathcliff conjectured,
he (<font color='blue'><b>Heathcliff</b></font>)'ll not win twenty. I doubt whether he (<font color='blue'><b>Heathcliff</b></font>)'ll see spring, indeed. And
small loss to his (<font color='blue'><b>Heathcliff</b></font>) family whenever he (<font color='blue'><b>Heathcliff</b></font>) drops off. And lucky it is for us
that his (<font color='blue'><b>Heathcliff</b></font>) father took him (<font color='blue'><b>Heathcliff</b></font>): the kinder he (<font color='blue'><b>Heathcliff</b></font>) was treated, the more tedious and
selfish he (<font color='blue'><b>Heathcliff</b></font>)'d be. I'm glad you have no chance of having him (<font color='blue'><b>Heathcliff</b></font>) for a
husband, Miss Catherine.''

 (<font color='red'><b>companion</b></font>)</div><p/>My companion waxed serious at hearing this speech. To speak of his (<font color='blue'><b>companion</b></font>) death
so regardlessly wounded her (<font color='blue'><b>Linton</b></font>) feelings.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``He (<font color='blue'><b>Heathcliff</b></font>)'s younger than I,''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Linton</b></font>) answered, after a protracted pause of
meditation, `and he (<font color='blue'><b>companion</b></font>) ought to live the longest: he (<font color='blue'><b>companion</b></font>) will--he (<font color='blue'><b>companion</b></font>) must live as
long as I do. He (<font color='blue'><b>companion</b></font>)'s as strong now as when he (<font color='blue'><b>companion</b></font>) first came into the north;
I'm positive of that. It's only a cold that ails him (<font color='blue'><b>companion</b></font>), the same as papa
has. You say papa will get better, and why shouldn't he (<font color='blue'><b>papa</b></font>)?''

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Well, well,''  (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div>I cried, `after all, we needn't trouble ourselves; for
listen, Miss,--and mind, I'll keep my word,--if you attempt going to
Wuthering Heights again, with or without me, I shall inform Mr. Linton,
and, unless he (<font color='blue'><b>Linton</b></font>) allow it, the intimacy with your cousin must not be
revived.''

<p/><div class="bookquote">``It has been revived,''  (<font color='red'><b>Cathy/Miss Cathy</b></font>)</div>muttered Cathy, sulkily.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Must not be continued, then,''  (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div>I said.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``We'll see,''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>was her (<font color='blue'><b>Cathy</b></font>) reply, and she (<font color='blue'><b>Cathy</b></font>) set off at a gallop, leaving me to
toil in the rear.

<p/>We both reached home before our dinner-time; my master supposed we had
been wandering through the park, and therefore he (<font color='blue'><b>master</b></font>) demanded no explanation
of our absence. As soon as I entered I hastened to change my soaked
shoes and stockings; but sitting such awhile at the Heights had done the
mischief. On the succeeding morning I was laid up, and during three
weeks I remained incapacitated for attending to my duties: a calamity
never experienced prior to that period, and never, I am thankful to say,
since.

<p/>My little mistress behaved like an angel in coming to wait on me, and
cheer my solitude; the confinement brought me exceedingly low. It is
wearisome, to a stirring active body: but few have slighter reasons for
complaint than I had. The moment Catherine left Mr. Linton's room she (<font color='blue'><b>Catherine</b></font>)
appeared at my bedside. Her (<font color='blue'><b>Catherine</b></font>) day was divided between us; no amusement
usurped a minute: she (<font color='blue'><b>Catherine</b></font>) neglected her (<font color='blue'><b>Catherine</b></font>) meals, her (<font color='blue'><b>Catherine</b></font>) studies, and her (<font color='blue'><b>Catherine</b></font>) play; and
she (<font color='blue'><b>Catherine</b></font>) was the fondest nurse that ever watched. She (<font color='blue'><b>Catherine</b></font>) must have had a warm
heart, when she (<font color='blue'><b>Catherine</b></font>) loved her (<font color='blue'><b>Catherine</b></font>) father so, to give so much to me. I said her (<font color='blue'><b>Catherine</b></font>)
days were divided between us; but the master retired early, and I
generally needed nothing after six o'clock, thus the evening was her (<font color='blue'><b>Catherine</b></font>) own.
Poor thing! I never considered what she (<font color='blue'><b>Catherine</b></font>) did with herself after tea. And
though frequently, when she (<font color='blue'><b>Catherine</b></font>) looked in to bid me good-night, I remarked a
fresh colour in her (<font color='blue'><b>Catherine</b></font>) cheeks and a pinkness over her (<font color='blue'><b>Catherine</b></font>) slender fingers,
instead of fancying the line borrowed from a cold ride across the moors,
I laid it to the charge of a hot fire in the library.




<p/>CHAPTER XXIV


<p/>At the close of three weeks I was able to quit my chamber and move about
the house. And on the first occasion of my sitting up in the evening I
asked Catherine to read to me, because my eyes were weak. We were in the
library, the master having gone to bed: she (<font color='blue'><b>Catherine</b></font>) consented, rather
unwillingly, I fancied; and imagining my sort of books did not suit her (<font color='blue'><b>Catherine</b></font>),
I bid her (<font color='blue'><b>Catherine</b></font>) please herself in the choice of what she (<font color='blue'><b>Catherine</b></font>) perused. She (<font color='blue'><b>Catherine</b></font>) selected
one of her (<font color='blue'><b>Catherine</b></font>) own favourites, and got forward steadily about an hour; then
came frequent questions.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Ellen, are not you tired? Hadn't you better lie down now? You'll be
sick, keeping up so long, Ellen.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``No, no, dear, I'm not tired,''  (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div>I returned, continually.

<p/>Perceiving me immovable, she (<font color='blue'><b>Catherine</b></font>) essayed another method of showing her (<font color='blue'><b>Catherine</b></font>)
disrelish for her (<font color='blue'><b>Catherine</b></font>) occupation. It changed to yawning, and stretching,
and--

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Ellen, I'm tired.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Give over then and talk,''  (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div>I answered.

<p/>That was worse: she (<font color='blue'><b>Catherine</b></font>) fretted and sighed, and looked at her (<font color='blue'><b>Catherine</b></font>) watch till
eight, and finally went to her (<font color='blue'><b>Catherine</b></font>) room, completely overdone with sleep;
judging by her (<font color='blue'><b>Catherine</b></font>) peevish, heavy look, and the constant rubbing she (<font color='blue'><b>Catherine</b></font>)
inflicted on her (<font color='blue'><b>Catherine</b></font>) eyes. The following night she (<font color='blue'><b>Catherine</b></font>) seemed more impatient
still; and on the third from recovering my company she (<font color='blue'><b>Catherine</b></font>) complained of a
headache, and left me. I thought her (<font color='blue'><b>Catherine</b></font>) conduct odd; and having remained
alone a long while, I resolved on going and inquiring whether she (<font color='blue'><b>Catherine</b></font>) were
better, and asking her (<font color='blue'><b>Catherine</b></font>) to come and lie on the sofa, instead of up-stairs
in the dark. No Catherine could I discover up-stairs, and none below.
The servants affirmed they had not seen her (<font color='blue'><b>Catherine</b></font>). I listened at Mr. Edgar's
door; all was silence. I returned to her (<font color='blue'><b>Catherine</b></font>) apartment, extinguished my
candle, and seated myself in the window.

<p/>The moon shone bright; a sprinkling of snow covered the ground, and I
reflected that she (<font color='blue'><b>Catherine</b></font>) might, possibly, have taken it into her (<font color='blue'><b>Catherine</b></font>) head to walk
about the garden, for refreshment. I did detect a figure creeping along
the inner fence of the park; but it was not my young mistress: on its
emerging into the light, I recognised one of the grooms. He (<font color='blue'><b>grooms</b></font>) stood a
considerable period, viewing the carriage-road through the grounds; then
started off at a brisk pace, as if he (<font color='blue'><b>grooms</b></font>) had detected something, and
reappeared presently, leading Miss's pony; and there she (<font color='blue'><b>mistress</b></font>) was, just
dismounted, and walking by its side. The man took his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) charge stealthily
across the grass towards the stable. Cathy entered by the
casement-window of the drawing-room, and glided noiselessly up to where I
awaited her (<font color='blue'><b>Cathy</b></font>). She (<font color='blue'><b>Cathy</b></font>) put the door gently too, slipped off her (<font color='blue'><b>Cathy</b></font>) snowy shoes,
untied her (<font color='blue'><b>Cathy</b></font>) hat, and was proceeding, unconscious of my espionage, to lay
aside her (<font color='blue'><b>Cathy</b></font>) mantle, when I suddenly rose and revealed myself. The surprise
petrified her (<font color='blue'><b>Cathy</b></font>) an instant: she (<font color='blue'><b>Cathy</b></font>) uttered an inarticulate exclamation, and
stood fixed.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``My dear Miss Catherine,''  (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div>I began, too vividly impressed by her (<font color='blue'><b>Cathy</b></font>) recent
kindness to break into a scold, `where have you been riding out at this
hour? And why should you try to deceive me by telling a tale? Where
have you been? Speak!''

<p/><div class="bookquote">``To the bottom of the park,''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Cathy</b></font>) stammered. <div class="bookquote">``I didn't tell a tale.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``And nowhere else?''  (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div>I demanded.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``No,''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>was the muttered reply.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Oh, Catherine!''  (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div>I cried, sorrowfully. <div class="bookquote">``You know you have been doing
wrong, or you wouldn't be driven to uttering an untruth to me. That does
grieve me. I'd rather be three months ill, than hear you frame a
deliberate lie.''

 (<font color='red'><b>She</b></font>)</div><p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>Cathy</b></font>) sprang forward, and bursting into tears, threw her (<font color='blue'><b>Cathy</b></font>) arms round my
neck.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Well, Ellen, I'm so afraid of you being angry,''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Cathy</b></font>) said. <div class="bookquote">``Promise not
to be angry, and you shall know the very truth: I hate to hide it.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/>We sat down in the window-seat; I assured her (<font color='blue'><b>Cathy</b></font>) I would not scold, whatever
her (<font color='blue'><b>Cathy</b></font>) secret might be, and I guessed it, of course; so she (<font color='blue'><b>Cathy</b></font>) commenced--

<p/>``I've been to Wuthering Heights, Ellen, and I've never missed going a day
since you fell ill; except thrice before, and twice after you left your
room. I gave Michael books and pictures to prepare Minny every evening,
and to put her (<font color='blue'><b>Ellen</b></font>) back in the stable: you mustn't scold him (<font color='blue'><b>Michael</b></font>) either, mind. I
was at the Heights by half-past six, and generally stayed till half-past
eight, and then galloped home. It was not to amuse myself that I went: I
was often wretched all the time. Now and then I was happy: once in a
week perhaps. At first, I expected there would be sad work persuading
you to let me keep my word to Linton: for I had engaged to call again
next day, when we quitted him (<font color='blue'><b>Michael</b></font>); but, as you stayed up-stairs on the
morrow, I escaped that trouble. While Michael was refastening the lock
of the park door in the afternoon, I got possession of the key, and told
him (<font color='blue'><b>Michael</b></font>) how my cousin wished me to visit him (<font color='blue'><b>cousin</b></font>), because he (<font color='blue'><b>cousin</b></font>) was sick, and
couldn't come to the Grange; and how papa would object to my going: and
then I negotiated with him (<font color='blue'><b>papa</b></font>) about the pony. He (<font color='blue'><b>papa</b></font>) is fond of reading, and he (<font color='blue'><b>papa</b></font>)
thinks of leaving soon to get married; so he (<font color='blue'><b>papa</b></font>) offered, if I would lend him (<font color='blue'><b>papa</b></font>)
books out of the library, to do what I wished: but I preferred giving him (<font color='blue'><b>papa</b></font>)
my own, and that satisfied him (<font color='blue'><b>papa</b></font>) better.

<p/>``On my second visit Linton seemed in lively spirits; and Zillah -LRB-that is
their housekeeper-RRB- made us a clean room and a good fire, and told us
that, as Joseph was out at a prayer-meeting and Hareton Earnshaw was off
with his (<font color='blue'><b>Earnshaw</b></font>) dogs--robbing our woods of pheasants, as I heard afterwards--we
might do what we liked. She (<font color='blue'><b>housekeeper</b></font>) brought me some warm wine and gingerbread,
and appeared exceedingly good-natured, and Linton sat in the arm-chair,
and I in the little rocking chair on the hearth-stone, and we laughed and
talked so merrily, and found so much to say: we planned where we would
go, and what we would do in summer. I needn't repeat that, because you
would call it silly.

<p/>``One time, however, we were near quarrelling. He (<font color='blue'><b>we</b></font>) said the pleasantest
manner of spending a hot July day was lying from morning till evening on
a bank of heath in the middle of the moors, with the bees humming
dreamily about among the bloom, and the larks singing high up overhead,
and the blue sky and bright sun shining steadily and cloudlessly. That
was his (<font color='blue'><b>we</b></font>) most perfect idea of heaven's happiness: mine was rocking in a
rustling green tree, with a west wind blowing, and bright white clouds
flitting rapidly above; and not only larks, but throstles, and
blackbirds, and linnets, and cuckoos pouring out music on every side, and
the moors seen at a distance, broken into cool dusky dells; but close by
great swells of long grass undulating in waves to the breeze; and woods
and sounding water, and the whole world awake and wild with joy. He (<font color='blue'><b>we</b></font>)
wanted all to lie in an ecstasy of peace; I wanted all to sparkle and
dance in a glorious jubilee. I said his (<font color='blue'><b>we</b></font>) heaven would be only half alive;
and he (<font color='blue'><b>we</b></font>) said mine would be drunk: I said I should fall asleep in his (<font color='blue'><b>we</b></font>); and
he (<font color='blue'><b>we</b></font>) said he (<font color='blue'><b>we</b></font>) could not breathe in mine, and began to grow very snappish. At
last, we agreed to try both, as soon as the right weather came; and then
we kissed each other and were friends.

<p/>``After sitting still an hour, I looked at the great room with its smooth
uncarpeted floor, and thought how nice it would be to play in, if we
removed the table; and I asked Linton to call Zillah in to help us, and
we'd have a game at blindman's-buff; she (<font color='blue'><b>Linton</b></font>) should try to catch us: you used
to, you know, Ellen. He (<font color='blue'><b>I</b></font>) wouldn't: there was no pleasure in it, he (<font color='blue'><b>I</b></font>) said;
but he (<font color='blue'><b>I</b></font>) consented to play at ball with me. We found two in a cupboard,
among a heap of old toys, tops, and hoops, and battledores and
shuttlecocks. One was marked C., and the other H.; I wished to have the
C., because that stood for Catherine, and the H. might be for Heathcliff,
his (<font color='blue'><b>Heathcliff</b></font>) name; but the bran came out of H., and Linton didn't like it. I beat
him (<font color='blue'><b>H.</b></font>) constantly: and he (<font color='blue'><b>H.</b></font>) got cross again, and coughed, and returned to his (<font color='blue'><b>H.</b></font>)
chair. That night, though, he (<font color='blue'><b>H.</b></font>) easily recovered his (<font color='blue'><b>H.</b></font>) good humour: he (<font color='blue'><b>H.</b></font>) was
charmed with two or three pretty songs--_your_ songs, Ellen; and when I
was obliged to go, he (<font color='blue'><b>H.</b></font>) begged and entreated me to come the following
evening; and I promised. Minny and I went flying home as light as air;
and I dreamt of Wuthering Heights and my sweet, darling cousin, till
morning.

<p/>``On the morrow I was sad; partly because you were poorly, and partly that
I wished my father knew, and approved of my excursions: but it was
beautiful moonlight after tea; and, as I rode on, the gloom cleared. I
shall have another happy evening, I thought to myself; and what delights
me more, my pretty Linton will. I trotted up their garden, and was
turning round to the back, when that fellow Earnshaw met me, took my
bridle, and bid me go in by the front entrance. He (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) patted Minny's neck,
and said she (<font color='blue'><b>Earnshaw</b></font>) was a bonny beast, and appeared as if he (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) wanted me to speak
to him (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>). I only told him (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) to leave my horse alone, or else it would kick
him (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>). He (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) answered in his (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) vulgar accent, ``It wouldn't do mitch hurt if it
did;'' and surveyed its legs with a smile. I was half inclined to make it
try; however, he (<font color='blue'><b>I</b></font>) moved off to open the door, and, as he (<font color='blue'><b>I</b></font>) raised the latch,
he (<font color='blue'><b>I</b></font>) looked up to the inscription above, and said, with a stupid mixture of
awkwardness and elation: <div class="bookquote">``Miss Catherine! I can read yon, now.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/>'<div class="bookquote">``Wonderful,''  (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div>I exclaimed. <div class="bookquote">``Pray let us hear you--you _are_ grown
clever!''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/>``He (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) spelt, and drawled over by syllables, the name--<div class="bookquote">``Hareton Earnshaw.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/>'<div class="bookquote">``And the figures?''  (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div>I cried, encouragingly, perceiving that he (<font color='blue'><b>I</b></font>) came to a
dead halt.

<p/>'<div class="bookquote">``I cannot tell them yet,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>I</b></font>) answered.

<p/>'<div class="bookquote">``Oh, you dunce!''  (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div>I said, laughing heartily at his (<font color='blue'><b>I</b></font>) failure.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``The fool stared, with a grin hovering about his (<font color='blue'><b>fool</b></font>) lips, and a scowl
gathering over his (<font color='blue'><b>fool</b></font>) eyes, as if uncertain whether he (<font color='blue'><b>fool</b></font>) might not join in my
mirth: whether it were not pleasant familiarity, or what it really was,
contempt. I settled his (<font color='blue'><b>fool</b></font>) doubts, by suddenly retrieving my gravity and
desiring him (<font color='blue'><b>fool</b></font>) to walk away, for I came to see Linton, not him (<font color='blue'><b>fool</b></font>). He (<font color='blue'><b>fool</b></font>)
reddened--I saw that by the moonlight--dropped his (<font color='blue'><b>fool</b></font>) hand from the latch,
and skulked off, a picture of mortified vanity. He (<font color='blue'><b>fool</b></font>) imagined himself to
be as accomplished as Linton, I suppose, because he (<font color='blue'><b>fool</b></font>) could spell his (<font color='blue'><b>fool</b></font>) own
name; and was marvellously discomfited that I didn't think the same.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Stop, Miss Catherine, dear!'' (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div>--I interrupted. <div class="bookquote">``I shall not scold, but I
don't like your conduct there. If you had remembered that Hareton was
your cousin as much as Master Heathcliff, you would have felt how
improper it was to behave in that way. At least, it was praiseworthy
ambition for him (<font color='blue'><b>Hareton</b></font>) to desire to be as accomplished as Linton; and probably
he (<font color='blue'><b>Hareton</b></font>) did not learn merely to show off: you had made him (<font color='blue'><b>Hareton</b></font>) ashamed of his (<font color='blue'><b>Hareton</b></font>)
ignorance before, I have no doubt; and he (<font color='blue'><b>Hareton</b></font>) wished to remedy it and please
you. To sneer at his (<font color='blue'><b>Hareton</b></font>) imperfect attempt was very bad breeding. Had you
been brought up in his (<font color='blue'><b>Hareton</b></font>) circumstances, would you be less rude? He (<font color='blue'><b>Hareton</b></font>) was as
quick and as intelligent a child as ever you were; and I'm hurt that he (<font color='blue'><b>Hareton</b></font>)
should be despised now, because that base Heathcliff has treated him (<font color='blue'><b>Heathcliff</b></font>) so
unjustly.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Well, Ellen, you won't cry about it, will you?''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Cathy</b></font>) exclaimed, surprised
at my earnestness. ``But wait, and you shall hear if he (<font color='blue'><b>Heathcliff</b></font>) conned his (<font color='blue'><b>Heathcliff</b></font>) A B C
to please me; and if it were worth while being civil to the brute. I
entered; Linton was lying on the settle, and half got up to welcome me.

<p/>'<div class="bookquote">``I'm ill to-night, Catherine, love,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>I</b></font>) said; <div class="bookquote">``and you must have all the
talk, and let me listen. Come, and sit by me. I was sure you wouldn't
break your word, and I'll make you promise again, before you go.''

 (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div><p/>``I knew now that I mustn't tease him (<font color='blue'><b>I</b></font>), as he (<font color='blue'><b>I</b></font>) was ill; and I spoke softly
and put no questions, and avoided irritating him (<font color='blue'><b>I</b></font>) in any way. I had
brought some of my nicest books for him (<font color='blue'><b>I</b></font>): he (<font color='blue'><b>I</b></font>) asked me to read a little of
one, and I was about to comply, when Earnshaw burst the door open: having
gathered venom with reflection. He (<font color='blue'><b>I</b></font>) advanced direct to us, seized Linton
by the arm, and swung him (<font color='blue'><b>I</b></font>) off the seat.

<p/>'<div class="bookquote">``Get to thy own room!''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>I</b></font>) said, in a voice almost inarticulate with
passion; and his (<font color='blue'><b>I</b></font>) face looked swelled and furious. <div class="bookquote">``Take her (<font color='blue'><b>Linton</b></font>) there if she (<font color='blue'><b>Linton</b></font>)
comes to see thee: thou shalln't keep me out of this. Begone wi' ye
both!''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/>``He (<font color='blue'><b>I</b></font>) swore at us, and left Linton no time to answer, nearly throwing him (<font color='blue'><b>I</b></font>)
into the kitchen; and he (<font color='blue'><b>I</b></font>) clenched his (<font color='blue'><b>I</b></font>) fist as I followed, seemingly
longing to knock me down. I was afraid for a moment, and I let one
volume fall; he (<font color='blue'><b>I</b></font>) kicked it after me, and shut us out. I heard a
malignant, crackly laugh by the fire, and turning, beheld that odious
Joseph standing rubbing his (<font color='blue'><b>Joseph</b></font>) bony hands, and quivering.

<p/>'<div class="bookquote">``I wer sure he (<font color='blue'><b>Joseph</b></font>)'d sarve ye out! He (<font color='blue'><b>Joseph</b></font>)'s a grand lad! He (<font color='blue'><b>Joseph</b></font>)'s getten t' raight

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/>'<div class="bookquote">``Where must we go?''  (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div>I asked of my cousin, disregarding the old wretch's
mockery.

<p/>``Linton was white and trembling. He (<font color='blue'><b>Joseph</b></font>) was not pretty then, Ellen: oh, no!
he (<font color='blue'><b>Joseph</b></font>) looked frightful; for his (<font color='blue'><b>Joseph</b></font>) thin face and large eyes were wrought into
an expression of frantic, powerless fury. He (<font color='blue'><b>Joseph</b></font>) grasped the handle of the
door, and shook it: it was fastened inside.

<p/>'<div class="bookquote">``If you don't let me in, I'll kill you!--If you don't let me in, I'll
kill you!''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>I</b></font>) rather shrieked than said. <div class="bookquote">``Devil! devil!--I'll kill
you--I'll kill you!''

 (<font color='red'><b>Joseph</b></font>)</div><p/>Joseph uttered his (<font color='blue'><b>Joseph</b></font>) croaking laugh again.

<p/>'<div class="bookquote">``Thear, that's t' father!''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Joseph</b></font>) cried. <div class="bookquote">``That's father! We've allas
summut o' either side in us. Niver heed, Hareton, lad--dunnut be
`feard--he (<font color='blue'><b>Hareton</b></font>) cannot get at thee!''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/>``I took hold of Linton's hands, and tried to pull him (<font color='blue'><b>Hareton</b></font>) away; but he (<font color='blue'><b>Hareton</b></font>)
shrieked so shockingly that I dared not proceed. At last his (<font color='blue'><b>Hareton</b></font>) cries were
choked by a dreadful fit of coughing; blood gushed from his (<font color='blue'><b>Hareton</b></font>) mouth, and he (<font color='blue'><b>Hareton</b></font>)
fell on the ground. I ran into the yard, sick with terror; and called
for Zillah, as loud as I could. She (<font color='blue'><b>Linton</b></font>) soon heard me: she (<font color='blue'><b>Linton</b></font>) was milking the
cows in a shed behind the barn, and hurrying from her (<font color='blue'><b>Linton</b></font>) work, she (<font color='blue'><b>Linton</b></font>) inquired
what there was to do? I hadn't breath to explain; dragging her (<font color='blue'><b>Linton</b></font>) in, I
looked about for Linton. Earnshaw had come out to examine the mischief
he (<font color='blue'><b>Hareton</b></font>) had caused, and he (<font color='blue'><b>Hareton</b></font>) was then conveying the poor thing up-stairs. Zillah
and I ascended after him (<font color='blue'><b>Hareton</b></font>); but he (<font color='blue'><b>Hareton</b></font>) stopped me at the top of the steps, and
said I shouldn't go in: I must go home. I exclaimed that he (<font color='blue'><b>Hareton</b></font>) had killed
Linton, and I _would_ enter. Joseph locked the door, and declared I
should do ``no sich stuff,'' and asked me whether I were <div class="bookquote">``bahn to be as mad
as him (<font color='blue'><b>Joseph</b></font>).''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>I stood crying till the housekeeper reappeared. She (<font color='blue'><b>housekeeper</b></font>) affirmed
he (<font color='blue'><b>Joseph</b></font>) would be better in a bit, but he (<font color='blue'><b>Joseph</b></font>) couldn't do with that shrieking and
din; and she (<font color='blue'><b>housekeeper</b></font>) took me, and nearly carried me into the house.

<p/>``Ellen, I was ready to tear my hair off my head! I sobbed and wept so
that my eyes were almost blind; and the ruffian you have such sympathy
with stood opposite: presuming every now and then to bid me <div class="bookquote">``wisht,''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>and
denying that it was his (<font color='blue'><b>Joseph</b></font>) fault; and, finally, frightened by my assertions
that I would tell papa, and that he (<font color='blue'><b>Joseph</b></font>) should be put in prison and hanged,
he (<font color='blue'><b>Joseph</b></font>) commenced blubbering himself, and hurried out to hide his (<font color='blue'><b>Joseph</b></font>) cowardly
agitation. Still, I was not rid of him (<font color='blue'><b>Joseph</b></font>): when at length they compelled me
to depart, and I had got some hundred yards off the premises, he (<font color='blue'><b>Joseph</b></font>) suddenly
issued from the shadow of the road-side, and checked Minny and took hold
of me.

<p/>'<div class="bookquote">``Miss Catherine, I'm ill grieved,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Joseph</b></font>) began, <div class="bookquote">``but it's rayther too bad--''

 (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div><p/>``I gave him (<font color='blue'><b>Joseph</b></font>) a cut with my whip, thinking perhaps he (<font color='blue'><b>Joseph</b></font>) would murder me. He (<font color='blue'><b>Joseph</b></font>)
let go, thundering one of his (<font color='blue'><b>Joseph</b></font>) horrid curses, and I galloped home more
than half out of my senses.

<p/>``I didn't bid you good-night that evening, and I didn't go to Wuthering
Heights the next: I wished to go exceedingly; but I was strangely
excited, and dreaded to hear that Linton was dead, sometimes; and
sometimes shuddered at the thought of encountering Hareton. On the third
day I took courage: at least, I couldn't bear longer suspense, and stole
off once more. I went at five o'clock, and walked; fancying I might
manage to creep into the house, and up to Linton's room, unobserved.
However, the dogs gave notice of my approach. Zillah received me, and
saying ``the lad was mending nicely,'' showed me into a small, tidy,
carpeted apartment, where, to my inexpressible joy, I beheld Linton laid
on a little sofa, reading one of my books. But he (<font color='blue'><b>Joseph</b></font>) would neither speak to
me nor look at me, through a whole hour, Ellen: he (<font color='blue'><b>Joseph</b></font>) has such an unhappy
temper. And what quite confounded me, when he (<font color='blue'><b>Joseph</b></font>) did open his (<font color='blue'><b>Joseph</b></font>) mouth, it was
to utter the falsehood that I had occasioned the uproar, and Hareton was
not to blame! Unable to reply, except passionately, I got up and walked
from the room. He (<font color='blue'><b>Hareton</b></font>) sent after me a faint ``Catherine!'' He (<font color='blue'><b>Hareton</b></font>) did not reckon
on being answered so: but I wouldn't turn back; and the morrow was the
second day on which I stayed at home, nearly determined to visit him (<font color='blue'><b>Hareton</b></font>) no
more. But it was so miserable going to bed and getting up, and never
hearing anything about him (<font color='blue'><b>Hareton</b></font>), that my resolution melted into air before it
was properly formed. It had appeared wrong to take the journey once; now
it seemed wrong to refrain. Michael came to ask if he (<font color='blue'><b>Michael</b></font>) must saddle Minny;
I said <div class="bookquote">``Yes,''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>and considered myself doing a duty as she (<font color='blue'><b>it</b></font>) bore me over the
hills. I was forced to pass the front windows to get to the court: it
was no use trying to conceal my presence.

<p/>'<div class="bookquote">``Young master is in the house,''  (<font color='red'><b>Zillah</b></font>)</div>said Zillah, as she (<font color='blue'><b>it</b></font>) saw me making for
the parlour. I went in; Earnshaw was there also, but he (<font color='blue'><b>Michael</b></font>) quitted the room
directly. Linton sat in the great arm-chair half asleep; walking up to
the fire, I began in a serious tone, partly meaning it to be true--

<p/>'<div class="bookquote">``As you don't like me, Linton, and as you think I come on purpose to
hurt you, and pretend that I do so every time, this is our last meeting:
let us say good-bye; and tell Mr. Heathcliff that you have no wish to see
me, and that he (<font color='blue'><b>Heathcliff</b></font>) mustn't invent any more falsehoods on the subject.''

 (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div><p/>'<div class="bookquote">``Sit down and take your hat off, Catherine,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Michael</b></font>) answered. <div class="bookquote">``You are so
much happier than I am, you ought to be better. Papa talks enough of my
defects, and shows enough scorn of me, to make it natural I should doubt
myself. I doubt whether I am not altogether as worthless as he (<font color='blue'><b>Papa</b></font>) calls me,
frequently; and then I feel so cross and bitter, I hate everybody! I am
worthless, and bad in temper, and bad in spirit, almost always; and, if
you choose, you may say good-bye: you'll get rid of an annoyance. Only,
Catherine, do me this justice: believe that if I might be as sweet, and
as kind, and as good as you are, I would be; as willingly, and more so,
than as happy and as healthy. And believe that your kindness has made me
love you deeper than if I deserved your love: and though I couldn't, and
cannot help showing my nature to you, I regret it and repent it; and
shall regret and repent it till I die!''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/>``I felt he (<font color='blue'><b>me</b></font>) spoke the truth; and I felt I must forgive him (<font color='blue'><b>me</b></font>): and, though we
should quarrel the next moment, I must forgive him (<font color='blue'><b>me</b></font>) again. We were
reconciled; but we cried, both of us, the whole time I stayed: not
entirely for sorrow; yet I _was_ sorry Linton had that distorted nature.
He (<font color='blue'><b>me</b></font>)'ll never let his (<font color='blue'><b>me</b></font>) friends be at ease, and he (<font color='blue'><b>me</b></font>)'ll never be at ease
himself! I have always gone to his (<font color='blue'><b>me</b></font>) little parlour, since that night;
because his (<font color='blue'><b>me</b></font>) father returned the day after.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``About three times, I think, we have been merry and hopeful, as we were
the first evening; the rest of my visits were dreary and troubled: now
with his (<font color='blue'><b>me</b></font>) selfishness and spite, and now with his (<font color='blue'><b>me</b></font>) sufferings: but I've
learned to endure the former with nearly as little resentment as the
latter. Mr. Heathcliff purposely avoids me: I have hardly seen him (<font color='blue'><b>Heathcliff</b></font>) at
all. Last Sunday, indeed, coming earlier than usual, I heard him (<font color='blue'><b>Heathcliff</b></font>) abusing
poor Linton cruelly for his (<font color='blue'><b>Heathcliff</b></font>) conduct of the night before. I can't tell
how he (<font color='blue'><b>Heathcliff</b></font>) knew of it, unless he (<font color='blue'><b>Heathcliff</b></font>) listened. Linton had certainly behaved
provokingly: however, it was the business of nobody but me, and I
interrupted Mr. Heathcliff's lecture by entering and telling him (<font color='blue'><b>Heathcliff</b></font>) so. He (<font color='blue'><b>Heathcliff</b></font>)
burst into a laugh, and went away, saying he (<font color='blue'><b>Heathcliff</b></font>) was glad I took that view of
the matter. Since then, I've told Linton he (<font color='blue'><b>Heathcliff</b></font>) must whisper his (<font color='blue'><b>Heathcliff</b></font>) bitter
things. Now, Ellen, you have heard all. I can't be prevented from going
to Wuthering Heights, except by inflicting misery on two people; whereas,
if you'll only not tell papa, my going need disturb the tranquillity of
none. You'll not tell, will you? It will be very heartless, if you do.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I'll make up my mind on that point by to-morrow, Miss Catherine,''  (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div>I
replied. <div class="bookquote">``It requires some study; and so I'll leave you to your rest,
and go think it over.''

 (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div><p/>I thought it over aloud, in my master's presence; walking straight from
her (<font color='blue'><b>Linton</b></font>) room to his (<font color='blue'><b>Michael</b></font>), and relating the whole story: with the exception of her (<font color='blue'><b>Linton</b></font>)
conversations with her (<font color='blue'><b>Linton</b></font>) cousin, and any mention of Hareton. Mr. Linton
was alarmed and distressed, more than he (<font color='blue'><b>Linton</b></font>) would acknowledge to me. In the
morning, Catherine learnt my betrayal of her (<font color='blue'><b>Catherine</b></font>) confidence, and she (<font color='blue'><b>Catherine</b></font>) learnt
also that her (<font color='blue'><b>Catherine</b></font>) secret visits were to end. In vain she (<font color='blue'><b>Catherine</b></font>) wept and writhed
against the interdict, and implored her (<font color='blue'><b>Catherine</b></font>) father to have pity on Linton:
all she (<font color='blue'><b>Linton</b></font>) got to comfort her (<font color='blue'><b>Linton</b></font>) was a promise that he (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) would write and give him (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>)
leave to come to the Grange when he (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) pleased; but explaining that he (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) must
no longer expect to see Catherine at Wuthering Heights. Perhaps, had he (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>)
been aware of his (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) nephew's disposition and state of health, he (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) would have
seen fit to withhold even that slight consolation.




<p/>CHAPTER XXV


<p/><div class="bookquote">``These things happened last winter, sir,''  (<font color='red'><b>Mrs. Dean</b></font>)</div>said Mrs. Dean; `hardly more
than a year ago. Last winter, I did not think, at another twelve months'
end, I should be amusing a stranger to the family with relating them!
Yet, who knows how long you'll be a stranger? You're too young to rest
always contented, living by yourself; and I some way fancy no one could
see Catherine Linton and not love her (<font color='blue'><b>Dean</b></font>). You smile; but why do you look so
lively and interested when I talk about her (<font color='blue'><b>Dean</b></font>)? and why have you asked me to
hang her (<font color='blue'><b>Dean</b></font>) picture over your fireplace? and why--?''

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Stop, my good friend!''  (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div>I cried. <div class="bookquote">``It may be very possible that _I_
should love her (<font color='blue'><b>Catherine</b></font>); but would she (<font color='blue'><b>Catherine</b></font>) love me? I doubt it too much to venture
my tranquillity by running into temptation: and then my home is not here.
I'm of the busy world, and to its arms I must return. Go on. Was
Catherine obedient to her (<font color='blue'><b>Catherine</b></font>) father's commands?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``She (<font color='blue'><b>Catherine</b></font>) was,''  (<font color='red'><b>the housekeeper</b></font>)</div>continued the housekeeper. ``Her (<font color='blue'><b>Catherine</b></font>) affection for him (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) was still
the chief sentiment in her (<font color='blue'><b>Catherine</b></font>) heart; and he (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) spoke without anger: he (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) spoke in
the deep tenderness of one about to leave his (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) treasure amid perils and
foes, where his (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) remembered words would be the only aid that he (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) could
bequeath to guide her (<font color='blue'><b>Catherine</b></font>). He (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) said to me, a few days afterwards, <div class="bookquote">``I wish my
nephew would write, Ellen, or call. Tell me, sincerely, what you think
of him (<font color='blue'><b>nephew</b></font>): is he (<font color='blue'><b>nephew</b></font>) changed for the better, or is there a prospect of
improvement, as he (<font color='blue'><b>nephew</b></font>) grows a man?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/>'<div class="bookquote">``He (<font color='blue'><b>nephew</b></font>)'s very delicate, sir,''  (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div>I replied; <div class="bookquote">``and scarcely likely to reach
manhood: but this I can say, he (<font color='blue'><b>nephew</b></font>) does not resemble his (<font color='blue'><b>nephew</b></font>) father; and if Miss
Catherine had the misfortune to marry him (<font color='blue'><b>nephew</b></font>), he (<font color='blue'><b>nephew</b></font>) would not be beyond her (<font color='blue'><b>Catherine</b></font>)
control: unless she (<font color='blue'><b>Catherine</b></font>) were extremely and foolishly indulgent. However,
master, you'll have plenty of time to get acquainted with him (<font color='blue'><b>master</b></font>) and see
whether he (<font color='blue'><b>master</b></font>) would suit her (<font color='blue'><b>Catherine</b></font>): it wants four years and more to his (<font color='blue'><b>master</b></font>) being of
age.'' (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div>'

<p/>Edgar sighed; and, walking to the window, looked out towards Gimmerton
Kirk. It was a misty afternoon, but the February sun shone dimly, and we
could just distinguish the two fir-trees in the yard, and the
sparely-scattered gravestones.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``I've prayed often,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Kirk</b></font>) half soliloquised, `for the approach of what is
coming; and now I begin to shrink, and fear it. I thought the memory of
the hour I came down that glen a bridegroom would be less sweet than the
anticipation that I was soon, in a few months, or, possibly, weeks, to be
carried up, and laid in its lonely hollow! Ellen, I've been very happy
with my little Cathy: through winter nights and summer days she (<font color='blue'><b>Cathy</b></font>) was a
living hope at my side. But I've been as happy musing by myself among
those stones, under that old church: lying, through the long June
evenings, on the green mound of her (<font color='blue'><b>Cathy</b></font>) mother's grave, and wishing--yearning
for the time when I might lie beneath it. What can I do for Cathy? How
must I quit her (<font color='blue'><b>Cathy</b></font>)? I'd not care one moment for Linton being Heathcliff's
son; nor for his (<font color='blue'><b>Heathcliff</b></font>) taking her (<font color='blue'><b>Linton</b></font>) from me, if he (<font color='blue'><b>Heathcliff</b></font>) could console her (<font color='blue'><b>Linton</b></font>) for my loss.
I'd not care that Heathcliff gained his (<font color='blue'><b>Heathcliff</b></font>) ends, and triumphed in robbing me
of my last blessing! But should Linton be unworthy--only a feeble tool
to his (<font color='blue'><b>Heathcliff</b></font>) father--I cannot abandon her (<font color='blue'><b>Linton</b></font>) to him (<font color='blue'><b>Heathcliff</b></font>)! And, hard though it be to
crush her (<font color='blue'><b>Linton</b></font>) buoyant spirit, I must persevere in making her (<font color='blue'><b>Linton</b></font>) sad while I
live, and leaving her (<font color='blue'><b>Linton</b></font>) solitary when I die. Darling! I'd rather resign
her (<font color='blue'><b>Linton</b></font>) to God, and lay her (<font color='blue'><b>Linton</b></font>) in the earth before me.''

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Resign her (<font color='blue'><b>Catherine</b></font>) to God as it is, sir,''  (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div>I answered, `and if we should lose
you--which may He (<font color='blue'><b>God</b></font>) forbid--under His (<font color='blue'><b>God</b></font>) providence, I'll stand her (<font color='blue'><b>Linton</b></font>) friend and
counsellor to the last. Miss Catherine is a good girl: I don't fear that
she (<font color='blue'><b>Catherine</b></font>) will go wilfully wrong; and people who do their duty are always
finally rewarded.''

<p/>Spring advanced; yet my master gathered no real strength, though he (<font color='blue'><b>master</b></font>)
resumed his (<font color='blue'><b>master</b></font>) walks in the grounds with his (<font color='blue'><b>master</b></font>) daughter. To her (<font color='blue'><b>daughter</b></font>) inexperienced
notions, this itself was a sign of convalescence; and then his (<font color='blue'><b>master</b></font>) cheek was
often flushed, and his (<font color='blue'><b>master</b></font>) eyes were bright; she (<font color='blue'><b>daughter</b></font>) felt sure of his (<font color='blue'><b>master</b></font>) recovering.
On her (<font color='blue'><b>daughter</b></font>) seventeenth birthday, he (<font color='blue'><b>master</b></font>) did not visit the churchyard: it was
raining, and I observed--<div class="bookquote">``You'll surely not go out to-night, sir?''

 (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div><p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>master</b></font>) answered,--<div class="bookquote">``No, I'll defer it this year a little longer.''  (<font color='red'><b>He</b></font>)</div>He (<font color='blue'><b>master</b></font>) wrote
again to Linton, expressing his (<font color='blue'><b>master</b></font>) great desire to see him (<font color='blue'><b>master</b></font>); and, had the
invalid been presentable, I've no doubt his (<font color='blue'><b>master</b></font>) father would have permitted
him (<font color='blue'><b>master</b></font>) to come. As it was, being instructed, he (<font color='blue'><b>master</b></font>) returned an answer,
intimating that Mr. Heathcliff objected to his (<font color='blue'><b>Heathcliff</b></font>) calling at the Grange; but
his (<font color='blue'><b>Heathcliff</b></font>) uncle's kind remembrance delighted him (<font color='blue'><b>Heathcliff</b></font>), and he (<font color='blue'><b>Heathcliff</b></font>) hoped to meet him (<font color='blue'><b>Heathcliff</b></font>)
sometimes in his (<font color='blue'><b>Heathcliff</b></font>) rambles, and personally to petition that his (<font color='blue'><b>Heathcliff</b></font>) cousin and
he (<font color='blue'><b>Heathcliff</b></font>) might not remain long so utterly divided.

<p/>That part of his (<font color='blue'><b>Heathcliff</b></font>) letter was simple, and probably his (<font color='blue'><b>Heathcliff</b></font>) own. Heathcliff
knew he (<font color='blue'><b>Heathcliff</b></font>) could plead eloquently for Catherine's company, then.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``I do not ask,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Heathcliff</b></font>) said, `that she (<font color='blue'><b>Catherine</b></font>) may visit here; but am I never to see
her (<font color='blue'><b>Catherine</b></font>), because my father forbids me to go to her (<font color='blue'><b>Catherine</b></font>) home, and you forbid her (<font color='blue'><b>Catherine</b></font>)
to come to mine? Do, now and then, ride with her (<font color='blue'><b>Catherine</b></font>) towards the Heights;
and let us exchange a few words, in your presence! We have done nothing
to deserve this separation; and you are not angry with me: you have no
reason to dislike me, you allow, yourself. Dear uncle! send me a kind
note to-morrow, and leave to join you anywhere you please, except at
Thrushcross Grange. I believe an interview would convince you that my
father's character is not mine: he (<font color='blue'><b>character</b></font>) affirms I am more your nephew than his (<font color='blue'><b>character</b></font>)
son; and though I have faults which render me unworthy of Catherine, she (<font color='blue'><b>Catherine</b></font>)
has excused them, and for her (<font color='blue'><b>Catherine</b></font>) sake, you should also. You inquire after
my health--it is better; but while I remain cut off from all hope, and
doomed to solitude, or the society of those who never did and never will
like me, how can I be cheerful and well?''

<p/>Edgar, though he (<font color='blue'><b>Edgar</b></font>) felt for the boy, could not consent to grant his (<font color='blue'><b>Edgar</b></font>)
request; because he (<font color='blue'><b>Edgar</b></font>) could not accompany Catherine. He (<font color='blue'><b>Edgar</b></font>) said, in summer,
perhaps, they might meet: meantime, he (<font color='blue'><b>Edgar</b></font>) wished him (<font color='blue'><b>Edgar</b></font>) to continue writing at
intervals, and engaged to give him (<font color='blue'><b>Edgar</b></font>) what advice and comfort he (<font color='blue'><b>Edgar</b></font>) was able by
letter; being well aware of his (<font color='blue'><b>Edgar</b></font>) hard position in his (<font color='blue'><b>Edgar</b></font>) family. Linton
complied; and had he (<font color='blue'><b>Edgar</b></font>) been unrestrained, would probably have spoiled all
by filling his (<font color='blue'><b>Edgar</b></font>) epistles with complaints and lamentations: but his (<font color='blue'><b>Edgar</b></font>) father
kept a sharp watch over him (<font color='blue'><b>Edgar</b></font>); and, of course, insisted on every line that
my master sent being shown; so, instead of penning his (<font color='blue'><b>master</b></font>) peculiar personal
sufferings and distresses, the themes constantly uppermost in his (<font color='blue'><b>master</b></font>)
thoughts, he (<font color='blue'><b>master</b></font>) harped on the cruel obligation of being held asunder from
his (<font color='blue'><b>master</b></font>) friend and love; and gently intimated that Mr. Linton must allow an
interview soon, or he (<font color='blue'><b>Linton</b></font>) should fear he (<font color='blue'><b>Linton</b></font>) was purposely deceiving him (<font color='blue'><b>Linton</b></font>) with
empty promises.

<p/>Cathy was a powerful ally at home; and between them they at length
persuaded my master to acquiesce in their having a ride or a walk
together about once a week, under my guardianship, and on the moors
nearest the Grange: for June found him (<font color='blue'><b>master</b></font>) still declining. Though he (<font color='blue'><b>master</b></font>) had
set aside yearly a portion of his (<font color='blue'><b>master</b></font>) income for my young lady's fortune, he (<font color='blue'><b>master</b></font>)
had a natural desire that she (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) might retain--or at least return in a short
time to--the house of her (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) ancestors; and he (<font color='blue'><b>master</b></font>) considered her (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) only prospect
of doing that was by a union with his (<font color='blue'><b>master</b></font>) heir; he (<font color='blue'><b>master</b></font>) had no idea that the
latter was failing almost as fast as himself; nor had any one, I believe:
no doctor visited the Heights, and no one saw Master Heathcliff to make
report of his (<font color='blue'><b>Master</b></font>) condition among us. I, for my part, began to fancy my
forebodings were false, and that he (<font color='blue'><b>Master</b></font>) must be actually rallying, when he (<font color='blue'><b>Master</b></font>)
mentioned riding and walking on the moors, and seemed so earnest in
pursuing his (<font color='blue'><b>Master</b></font>) object. I could not picture a father treating a dying child
as tyrannically and wickedly as I afterwards learned Heathcliff had
treated him (<font color='blue'><b>Heathcliff</b></font>), to compel this apparent eagerness: his (<font color='blue'><b>Heathcliff</b></font>) efforts redoubling
the more imminently his (<font color='blue'><b>Heathcliff</b></font>) avaricious and unfeeling plans were threatened
with defeat by death.




<p/>CHAPTER XXVI


<p/>Summer was already past its prime, when Edgar reluctantly yielded his (<font color='blue'><b>Edgar</b></font>)
assent to their entreaties, and Catherine and I set out on our first ride
to join her (<font color='blue'><b>Catherine</b></font>) cousin. It was a close, sultry day: devoid of sunshine, but
with a sky too dappled and hazy to threaten rain: and our place of
meeting had been fixed at the guide-stone, by the cross-roads. On
arriving there, however, a little herd-boy, despatched as a messenger,
told us that,--<div class="bookquote">``Maister Linton wer just o' this side th' Heights: and
he (<font color='blue'><b>Linton</b></font>)'d be mitch obleeged to us to gang on a bit further.''

 (<font color='red'><b>a messenger</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Then Master Linton has forgot the first injunction of his (<font color='blue'><b>Master</b></font>) uncle,''  (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div>I
observed: `he (<font color='blue'><b>cousin</b></font>) bid us keep on the Grange land, and here we are off at
once.''

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Well, we'll turn our horses' heads round when we reach him (<font color='blue'><b>Master</b></font>),''  (<font color='red'><b>companion</b></font>)</div>answered my
companion; `our excursion shall lie towards home.''

<p/>But when we reached him (<font color='blue'><b>companion</b></font>), and that was scarcely a quarter of a mile from
his (<font color='blue'><b>companion</b></font>) own door, we found he (<font color='blue'><b>companion</b></font>) had no horse; and we were forced to dismount,
and leave ours to graze. He (<font color='blue'><b>companion</b></font>) lay on the heath, awaiting our approach, and
did not rise till we came within a few yards. Then he (<font color='blue'><b>companion</b></font>) walked so feebly,
and looked so pale, that I immediately exclaimed,--<div class="bookquote">``Why, Master
Heathcliff, you are not fit for enjoying a ramble this morning. How ill
you do look!''

 (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div><p/>Catherine surveyed him (<font color='blue'><b>companion</b></font>) with grief and astonishment: she (<font color='blue'><b>Catherine</b></font>) changed the
ejaculation of joy on her (<font color='blue'><b>Catherine</b></font>) lips to one of alarm; and the congratulation on
their long-postponed meeting to an anxious inquiry, whether he (<font color='blue'><b>companion</b></font>) were worse
than usual?

<p/><div class="bookquote">``No--better--better!''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>companion</b></font>) panted, trembling, and retaining her (<font color='blue'><b>Catherine</b></font>) hand as if
he (<font color='blue'><b>companion</b></font>) needed its support, while his (<font color='blue'><b>companion</b></font>) large blue eyes wandered timidly over
her (<font color='blue'><b>Catherine</b></font>); the hollowness round them transforming to haggard wildness the
languid expression they once possessed.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``But you have been worse,''  (<font color='red'><b>cousin</b></font>)</div>persisted his (<font color='blue'><b>companion</b></font>) cousin; `worse than when I saw
you last; you are thinner, and--'

<p/><div class="bookquote">``I'm tired,''  (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>companion</b></font>) interrupted, hurriedly. <div class="bookquote">``It is too hot for walking, let
us rest here. And, in the morning, I often feel sick--papa says I grow
so fast.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Cathy/Miss Cathy</b></font>)</div><p/>Badly satisfied, Cathy sat down, and he (<font color='blue'><b>companion</b></font>) reclined beside her (<font color='blue'><b>Cathy</b></font>).

<p/><div class="bookquote">``This is something like your paradise,''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>said she (<font color='blue'><b>Cathy</b></font>), making an effort at
cheerfulness. <div class="bookquote">``You recollect the two days we agreed to spend in the
place and way each thought pleasantest? This is nearly yours, only there
are clouds; but then they are so soft and mellow: it is nicer than
sunshine. Next week, if you can, we'll ride down to the Grange Park, and
try mine.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Linton/Mrs. Linton/Mrs. Heathcliff</b></font>)</div><p/>Linton did not appear to remember what she (<font color='blue'><b>Linton</b></font>) talked of and he (<font color='blue'><b>companion</b></font>) had evidently
great difficulty in sustaining any kind of conversation. His (<font color='blue'><b>companion</b></font>) lack of
interest in the subjects she (<font color='blue'><b>Linton</b></font>) started, and his (<font color='blue'><b>companion</b></font>) equal incapacity to
contribute to her (<font color='blue'><b>Linton</b></font>) entertainment, were so obvious that she (<font color='blue'><b>Linton</b></font>) could not
conceal her (<font color='blue'><b>Linton</b></font>) disappointment. An indefinite alteration had come over his (<font color='blue'><b>companion</b></font>)
whole person and manner. The pettishness that might be caressed into
fondness, had yielded to a listless apathy; there was less of the peevish
temper of a child which frets and teases on purpose to be soothed, and
more of the self-absorbed moroseness of a confirmed invalid, repelling
consolation, and ready to regard the good-humoured mirth of others as an
insult. Catherine perceived, as well as I did, that he (<font color='blue'><b>companion</b></font>) held it rather a
punishment, than a gratification, to endure our company; and she (<font color='blue'><b>Catherine</b></font>) made no
scruple of proposing, presently, to depart. That proposal, unexpectedly,
roused Linton from his (<font color='blue'><b>companion</b></font>) lethargy, and threw him (<font color='blue'><b>companion</b></font>) into a strange state of
agitation. He (<font color='blue'><b>companion</b></font>) glanced fearfully towards the Heights, begging she (<font color='blue'><b>Linton</b></font>) would
remain another half-hour, at least.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``But I think,''  (<font color='red'><b>Cathy/Miss Cathy</b></font>)</div>said Cathy, `you'd be more comfortable at home than
sitting here; and I cannot amuse you to-day, I see, by my tales, and
songs, and chatter: you have grown wiser than I, in these six months; you
have little taste for my diversions now: or else, if I could amuse you,
I'd willingly stay.''

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Stay to rest yourself,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>companion</b></font>) replied. <div class="bookquote">``And, Catherine, don't think or say
that I'm _very_ unwell: it is the heavy weather and heat that make me
dull; and I walked about, before you came, a great deal for me. Tell
uncle I'm in tolerable health, will you?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I'll tell him (<font color='blue'><b>uncle</b></font>) that _you_ say so, Linton. I couldn't affirm that you
are,''  (<font color='red'><b>lady</b></font>)</div>observed my young lady, wondering at his (<font color='blue'><b>companion</b></font>) pertinacious assertion of
what was evidently an untruth.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``And be here again next Thursday,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>continued he (<font color='blue'><b>companion</b></font>), shunning her (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) puzzled
gaze. <div class="bookquote">``And give him (<font color='blue'><b>uncle</b></font>) my thanks for permitting you to come--my best
thanks, Catherine. And--and, if you _did_ meet my father, and he (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) asked
you about me, don't lead him (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) to suppose that I've been extremely silent
and stupid: don't look sad and downcast, as you are doing--he (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>)'ll be
angry.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I care nothing for his (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) anger,''  (<font color='red'><b>Cathy/Miss Cathy</b></font>)</div>exclaimed Cathy, imagining she (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) would be
its object.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``But I do,''  (<font color='red'><b>cousin</b></font>)</div>said her (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) cousin, shuddering. '_Don't_ provoke him (<font color='blue'><b>cousin</b></font>) against
me, Catherine, for he (<font color='blue'><b>cousin</b></font>) is very hard.''

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Is he (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) severe to you, Master Heathcliff?''  (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div>I inquired. <div class="bookquote">``Has he (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) grown
weary of indulgence, and passed from passive to active hatred?''

 (<font color='red'><b>Linton/Mrs. Linton/Mrs. Heathcliff</b></font>)</div><p/>Linton looked at me, but did not answer; and, after keeping her (<font color='blue'><b>Linton</b></font>) seat by
his (<font color='blue'><b>cousin</b></font>) side another ten minutes, during which his (<font color='blue'><b>cousin</b></font>) head fell drowsily on his (<font color='blue'><b>cousin</b></font>)
breast, and he (<font color='blue'><b>cousin</b></font>) uttered nothing except suppressed moans of exhaustion or
pain, Cathy began to seek solace in looking for bilberries, and sharing
the produce of her (<font color='blue'><b>Cathy</b></font>) researches with me: she (<font color='blue'><b>Cathy</b></font>) did not offer them to him (<font color='blue'><b>cousin</b></font>), for
she (<font color='blue'><b>Cathy</b></font>) saw further notice would only weary and annoy.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Is it half-an-hour now, Ellen?''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Cathy</b></font>) whispered in my ear, at last. <div class="bookquote">``I
can't tell why we should stay. He (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>)'s asleep, and papa will be wanting us
back.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Well, we must not leave him (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) asleep,''  (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div>I answered; `wait till he (<font color='blue'><b>cousin</b></font>) wakes,
and be patient. You were mighty eager to set off, but your longing to
see poor Linton has soon evaporated!''

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Why did _he (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>)_ wish to see me?''  (<font color='red'><b>Catherine/Earnshaw/Catherine Earnshaw</b></font>)</div>returned Catherine. <div class="bookquote">``In his (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) crossest
humours, formerly, I liked him (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) better than I do in his (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) present curious
mood. It's just as if it were a task he (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) was compelled to perform--this
interview--for fear his (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) father should scold him (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>). But I'm hardly going to
come to give Mr. Heathcliff pleasure; whatever reason he (<font color='blue'><b>Heathcliff</b></font>) may have for
ordering Linton to undergo this penance. And, though I'm glad he (<font color='blue'><b>Heathcliff</b></font>)'s
better in health, I'm sorry he (<font color='blue'><b>Heathcliff</b></font>)'s so much less pleasant, and so much less
affectionate to me.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``You think _he (<font color='blue'><b>Heathcliff</b></font>) is_ better in health, then?''  (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div>I said.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Yes,''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Catherine</b></font>) answered; `because he (<font color='blue'><b>cousin</b></font>) always made such a great deal of his (<font color='blue'><b>cousin</b></font>)
sufferings, you know. He (<font color='blue'><b>cousin</b></font>) is not tolerably well, as he (<font color='blue'><b>cousin</b></font>) told me to tell
papa; but he (<font color='blue'><b>cousin</b></font>)'s better, very likely.''

<p/><div class="bookquote">``There you differ with me, Miss Cathy,''  (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div>I remarked; <div class="bookquote">``I should conjecture
him (<font color='blue'><b>Heathcliff</b></font>) to be far worse.''

 (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div><p/>Linton here started from his (<font color='blue'><b>cousin</b></font>) slumber in bewildered terror, and asked if
any one had called his (<font color='blue'><b>cousin</b></font>) name.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``No,''  (<font color='red'><b>Catherine/Earnshaw/Catherine Earnshaw</b></font>)</div>said Catherine; `unless in dreams. I cannot conceive how you
manage to doze out of doors, in the morning.''

<p/><div class="bookquote">``I thought I heard my father,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>cousin</b></font>) gasped, glancing up to the frowning nab
above us. <div class="bookquote">``You are sure nobody spoke?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Quite sure,''  (<font color='red'><b>cousin</b></font>)</div>replied his (<font color='blue'><b>cousin</b></font>) cousin. <div class="bookquote">``Only Ellen and I were disputing
concerning your health. Are you truly stronger, Linton, than when we
separated in winter? If you be, I'm certain one thing is not
stronger--your regard for me: speak,--are you?''

 (<font color='red'><b>Linton/Mrs. Linton/Mrs. Heathcliff</b></font>)</div><p/>The tears gushed from Linton's eyes as he (<font color='blue'><b>cousin</b></font>) answered, <div class="bookquote">``Yes, yes, I am!''
 (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>And, still under the spell of the imaginary voice, his (<font color='blue'><b>cousin</b></font>) gaze wandered up
and down to detect its owner.

<p/>Cathy rose. <div class="bookquote">``For to-day we must part,''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Cathy</b></font>) said. <div class="bookquote">``And I won't conceal
that I have been sadly disappointed with our meeting; though I'll mention
it to nobody but you: not that I stand in awe of Mr. Heathcliff.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Hush,''  (<font color='red'><b>Linton/Mrs. Linton/Mrs. Heathcliff</b></font>)</div>murmured Linton; `for God's sake, hush! He (<font color='blue'><b>God</b></font>)'s coming.'' And he (<font color='blue'><b>God</b></font>)
clung to Catherine's arm, striving to detain her (<font color='blue'><b>Catherine</b></font>); but at that
announcement she (<font color='blue'><b>Catherine</b></font>) hastily disengaged herself, and whistled to Minny, who
obeyed her (<font color='blue'><b>Catherine</b></font>) like a dog.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``I'll be here next Thursday,''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Catherine</b></font>) cried, springing to the saddle.
<div class="bookquote">``Good-bye. Quick, Ellen!''

 (<font color='red'><b>him</b></font>)</div><p/>And so we left him (<font color='blue'><b>God</b></font>), scarcely conscious of our departure, so absorbed was
he (<font color='blue'><b>God</b></font>) in anticipating his (<font color='blue'><b>God</b></font>) father's approach.

<p/>Before we reached home, Catherine's displeasure softened into a perplexed
sensation of pity and regret, largely blended with vague, uneasy doubts
about Linton's actual circumstances, physical and social: in which I
partook, though I counselled her (<font color='blue'><b>Linton</b></font>) not to say much; for a second journey
would make us better judges. My master requested an account of our
ongoings. His (<font color='blue'><b>master</b></font>) nephew's offering of thanks was duly delivered, Miss Cathy
gently touching on the rest: I also threw little light on his (<font color='blue'><b>master</b></font>) inquiries,
for I hardly knew what to hide and what to reveal.




<p/>CHAPTER XXVII


<p/>Seven days glided away, every one marking its course by the henceforth
rapid alteration of Edgar Linton's state. The havoc that months had
previously wrought was now emulated by the inroads of hours. Catherine
we would fain have deluded yet; but her (<font color='blue'><b>Catherine</b></font>) own quick spirit refused to
delude her (<font color='blue'><b>Catherine</b></font>): it divined in secret, and brooded on the dreadful
probability, gradually ripening into certainty. She (<font color='blue'><b>Catherine</b></font>) had not the heart to
mention her (<font color='blue'><b>Catherine</b></font>) ride, when Thursday came round; I mentioned it for her (<font color='blue'><b>Catherine</b></font>), and
obtained permission to order her (<font color='blue'><b>Catherine</b></font>) out of doors: for the library, where her (<font color='blue'><b>Catherine</b></font>)
father stopped a short time daily--the brief period he (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) could bear to sit
up--and his (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) chamber, had become her (<font color='blue'><b>Catherine</b></font>) whole world. She (<font color='blue'><b>Catherine</b></font>) grudged each moment
that did not find her (<font color='blue'><b>Catherine</b></font>) bending over his (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) pillow, or seated by his (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) side. Her (<font color='blue'><b>Catherine</b></font>)
countenance grew wan with watching and sorrow, and my master gladly
dismissed her (<font color='blue'><b>Catherine</b></font>) to what he (<font color='blue'><b>master</b></font>) flattered himself would be a happy change of
scene and society; drawing comfort from the hope that she (<font color='blue'><b>Catherine</b></font>) would not now
be left entirely alone after his (<font color='blue'><b>master</b></font>) death.

<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>master</b></font>) had a fixed idea, I guessed by several observations he (<font color='blue'><b>master</b></font>) let fall, that,
as his (<font color='blue'><b>master</b></font>) nephew resembled him (<font color='blue'><b>master</b></font>) in person, he (<font color='blue'><b>master</b></font>) would resemble him (<font color='blue'><b>master</b></font>) in mind; for
Linton's letters bore few or no indications of his (<font color='blue'><b>master</b></font>) defective character.
And I, through pardonable weakness, refrained from correcting the error;
asking myself what good there would be in disturbing his (<font color='blue'><b>master</b></font>) last moments
with information that he (<font color='blue'><b>master</b></font>) had neither power nor opportunity to turn to
account.

<p/>We deferred our excursion till the afternoon; a golden afternoon of
August: every breath from the hills so full of life, that it seemed
whoever respired it, though dying, might revive. Catherine's face was
just like the landscape--shadows and sunshine flitting over it in rapid
succession; but the shadows rested longer, and the sunshine was more
transient; and her (<font color='blue'><b>Catherine</b></font>) poor little heart reproached itself for even that
passing forgetfulness of its cares.

<p/>We discerned Linton watching at the same spot he (<font color='blue'><b>its</b></font>) had selected before. My
young mistress alighted, and told me that, as she (<font color='blue'><b>mistress</b></font>) was resolved to stay a
very little while, I had better hold the pony and remain on horseback;
but I dissented: I wouldn't risk losing sight of the charge committed to
me a minute; so we climbed the slope of heath together. Master
Heathcliff received us with greater animation on this occasion: not the
animation of high spirits though, nor yet of joy; it looked more like
fear.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``It is late!''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Heathcliff</b></font>) said, speaking short and with difficulty. <div class="bookquote">``Is not your
father very ill? I thought you wouldn't come.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/>'_Why_ won't you be candid?'' cried Catherine, swallowing her (<font color='blue'><b>Catherine</b></font>) greeting.
<div class="bookquote">``Why cannot you say at once you don't want me? It is strange, Linton,
that for the second time you have brought me here on purpose, apparently
to distress us both, and for no reason besides!''

 (<font color='red'><b>Linton/Mrs. Linton/Mrs. Heathcliff</b></font>)</div><p/>Linton shivered, and glanced at her (<font color='blue'><b>Linton</b></font>), half supplicating, half ashamed; but
his (<font color='blue'><b>Heathcliff</b></font>) cousin's patience was not sufficient to endure this enigmatical
behaviour.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``My father _is_ very ill,''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Linton</b></font>) said; `and why am I called from his (<font color='blue'><b>Heathcliff</b></font>)
bedside? Why didn't you send to absolve me from my promise, when you
wished I wouldn't keep it? Come! I desire an explanation: playing and
trifling are completely banished out of my mind; and I can't dance
attendance on your affectations now!''

<p/><div class="bookquote">``My affectations!''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Heathcliff</b></font>) murmured; `what are they? For heaven's sake,
Catherine, don't look so angry! Despise me as much as you please; I am a
worthless, cowardly wretch: I can't be scorned enough; but I'm too mean
for your anger. Hate my father, and spare me for contempt.''

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Nonsense!''  (<font color='red'><b>Catherine/Earnshaw/Catherine Earnshaw</b></font>)</div>cried Catherine in a passion. ``Foolish, silly boy! And
there! he (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>) trembles: as if I were really going to touch him (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>)! You needn't
bespeak contempt, Linton: anybody will have it spontaneously at your
service. Get off! I shall return home: it is folly dragging you from
the hearth-stone, and pretending--what do we pretend? Let go my frock!
If I pitied you for crying and looking so very frightened, you should
spurn such pity. Ellen, tell him (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>) how disgraceful this conduct is. Rise,
and don't degrade yourself into an abject reptile--_don<div class="bookquote">``t_!''

 (<font color='red'><b>Linton/Mrs. Linton/Mrs. Heathcliff</b></font>)</div><p/>With streaming face and an expression of agony, Linton had thrown his (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>)
nerveless frame along the ground: he (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) seemed convulsed with exquisite
terror.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Oh!''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) sobbed, <div class="bookquote">``I cannot bear it! Catherine, Catherine, I'm a traitor,
too, and I dare not tell you! But leave me, and I shall be killed!
_Dear_ Catherine, my life is in your hands: and you have said you loved
me, and if you did, it wouldn't harm you. You'll not go, then? kind,
sweet, good Catherine! And perhaps you _will_ consent--and he (<font color='blue'><b>traitor</b></font>)'ll let me
die with you!''

 (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div><p/>My young lady, on witnessing his (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) intense anguish, stooped to raise him (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>).
The old feeling of indulgent tenderness overcame her (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) vexation, and she (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>)
grew thoroughly moved and alarmed.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Consent to what?''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) asked. <div class="bookquote">``To stay! tell me the meaning of this
strange talk, and I will. You contradict your own words, and distract
me! Be calm and frank, and confess at once all that weighs on your
heart. You wouldn't injure me, Linton, would you? You wouldn't let any
enemy hurt me, if you could prevent it? I'll believe you are a coward,
for yourself, but not a cowardly betrayer of your best friend.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``But my father threatened me,''  (<font color='red'><b>the boy</b></font>)</div>gasped the boy, clasping his (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>) attenuated
fingers, `and I dread him (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>)--I dread him (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>)! I _dare_ not tell!''

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Oh, well!''  (<font color='red'><b>Catherine/Earnshaw/Catherine Earnshaw</b></font>)</div>said Catherine, with scornful compassion, `keep your secret:
_I'm_ no coward. Save yourself: I'm not afraid!''

<p/>Her (<font color='blue'><b>Catherine</b></font>) magnanimity provoked his (<font color='blue'><b>coward</b></font>) tears: he (<font color='blue'><b>coward</b></font>) wept wildly, kissing her (<font color='blue'><b>Catherine</b></font>)
supporting hands, and yet could not summon courage to speak out. I was
cogitating what the mystery might be, and determined Catherine should
never suffer to benefit him (<font color='blue'><b>coward</b></font>) or any one else, by my good will; when,
hearing a rustle among the ling, I looked up and saw Mr. Heathcliff
almost close upon us, descending the Heights. He (<font color='blue'><b>Heathcliff</b></font>) didn't cast a glance
towards my companions, though they were sufficiently near for Linton's
sobs to be audible; but hailing me in the almost hearty tone he (<font color='blue'><b>Heathcliff</b></font>) assumed
to none besides, and the sincerity of which I couldn't avoid doubting, he (<font color='blue'><b>Heathcliff</b></font>)
said--

<p/><div class="bookquote">``It is something to see you so near to my house, Nelly. How are you at
the Grange? Let us hear. The rumour goes,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Heathcliff</b></font>) added, in a lower tone,
`that Edgar Linton is on his (<font color='blue'><b>Linton</b></font>) death-bed: perhaps they exaggerate his (<font color='blue'><b>Linton</b></font>)
illness?''

<p/><div class="bookquote">``No; my master is dying,''  (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div>I replied: `it is true enough. A sad thing it
will be for us all, but a blessing for him (<font color='blue'><b>Linton</b></font>)!''

<p/><div class="bookquote">``How long will he (<font color='blue'><b>master</b></font>) last, do you think?''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Linton</b></font>) asked.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``I don't know,''  (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div>I said.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Because,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Linton</b></font>) continued, looking at the two young people, who were fixed
under his (<font color='blue'><b>Linton</b></font>) eye--Linton appeared as if he (<font color='blue'><b>Linton</b></font>) could not venture to stir or
raise his (<font color='blue'><b>Linton</b></font>) head, and Catherine could not move, on his (<font color='blue'><b>Linton</b></font>) account--`because
that lad yonder seems determined to beat me; and I'd thank his (<font color='blue'><b>Linton</b></font>) uncle to
be quick, and go before him (<font color='blue'><b>Linton</b></font>)! Hallo! has the whelp been playing that game
long? I _did_ give him (<font color='blue'><b>Linton</b></font>) some lessons about snivelling. Is he (<font color='blue'><b>Linton</b></font>) pretty
lively with Miss Linton generally?''

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Lively? no--he (<font color='blue'><b>master</b></font>) has shown the greatest distress,''  (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div>I answered. <div class="bookquote">``To see
him (<font color='blue'><b>master</b></font>), I should say, that instead of rambling with his (<font color='blue'><b>master</b></font>) sweetheart on the
hills, he (<font color='blue'><b>master</b></font>) ought to be in bed, under the hands of a doctor.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``He (<font color='blue'><b>master</b></font>) shall be, in a day or two,''  (<font color='red'><b>Heathcliff/Mr. Heathcliff</b></font>)</div>muttered Heathcliff. <div class="bookquote">``But first--get up,
Linton! Get up!''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Heathcliff</b></font>) shouted. <div class="bookquote">``Don't grovel on the ground there up, this
moment!''

 (<font color='red'><b>Linton/Mrs. Linton/Mrs. Heathcliff</b></font>)</div><p/>Linton had sunk prostrate again in another paroxysm of helpless fear,
caused by his (<font color='blue'><b>Heathcliff</b></font>) father's glance towards him (<font color='blue'><b>Heathcliff</b></font>), I suppose: there was nothing
else to produce such humiliation. He (<font color='blue'><b>Heathcliff</b></font>) made several efforts to obey, but
his (<font color='blue'><b>Heathcliff</b></font>) little strength was annihilated for the time, and he (<font color='blue'><b>Heathcliff</b></font>) fell back again
with a moan. Mr. Heathcliff advanced, and lifted him (<font color='blue'><b>Heathcliff</b></font>) to lean against a
ridge of turf.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Now,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>said he (<font color='blue'><b>Heathcliff</b></font>), with curbed ferocity, <div class="bookquote">``I'm getting angry and if you don't
command that paltry spirit of yours--_damn_ you! get up directly!''

 (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I will, father,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Heathcliff</b></font>) panted. <div class="bookquote">``Only, let me alone, or I shall faint. I've
done as you wished, I'm sure. Catherine will tell you that I--that
I--have been cheerful. Ah! keep by me, Catherine; give me your hand.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Take mine,''  (<font color='red'><b>father</b></font>)</div>said his (<font color='blue'><b>Heathcliff</b></font>) father; `stand on your feet. There now--she (<font color='blue'><b>Linton</b></font>)'ll
lend you her (<font color='blue'><b>Linton</b></font>) arm: that's right, look at her (<font color='blue'><b>Linton</b></font>). You would imagine I was the
devil himself, Miss Linton, to excite such horror. Be so kind as to walk
home with him (<font color='blue'><b>devil</b></font>), will you? He (<font color='blue'><b>devil</b></font>) shudders if I touch him (<font color='blue'><b>devil</b></font>).''

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Linton dear!''  (<font color='red'><b>Catherine/Earnshaw/Catherine Earnshaw</b></font>)</div>whispered Catherine, <div class="bookquote">``I can't go to Wuthering Heights:
papa has forbidden me. He (<font color='blue'><b>papa</b></font>)'ll not harm you: why are you so afraid?''

 (<font color='red'><b>Catherine/Earnshaw/Catherine Earnshaw</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I can never re-enter that house,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>devil</b></font>) answered. <div class="bookquote">``I'm _not_ to re-enter
it without you!''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Stop!''  (<font color='red'><b>father</b></font>)</div>cried his (<font color='blue'><b>devil</b></font>) father. <div class="bookquote">``We'll respect Catherine's filial scruples.
Nelly, take him (<font color='blue'><b>Nelly</b></font>) in, and I'll follow your advice concerning the doctor,
without delay.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``You'll do well,''  (<font color='red'><b>I.</b></font>)</div>replied I. <div class="bookquote">``But I must remain with my mistress: to
mind your son is not my business.''

 (<font color='red'><b>I.</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``You are very stiff,''  (<font color='red'><b>Heathcliff/Mr. Heathcliff</b></font>)</div>said Heathcliff, <div class="bookquote">``I know that: but you'll force me
to pinch the baby and make it scream before it moves your charity. Come,
then, my hero. Are you willing to return, escorted by me?''

 (<font color='red'><b>Heathcliff/Mr. Heathcliff</b></font>)</div><p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Heathcliff</b></font>) approached once more, and made as if he (<font color='blue'><b>Heathcliff</b></font>) would seize the fragile being;
but, shrinking back, Linton clung to his (<font color='blue'><b>Heathcliff</b></font>) cousin, and implored her (<font color='blue'><b>Linton</b></font>) to
accompany him (<font color='blue'><b>Heathcliff</b></font>), with a frantic importunity that admitted no denial.
However I disapproved, I couldn't hinder her (<font color='blue'><b>Linton</b></font>): indeed, how could she (<font color='blue'><b>Linton</b></font>) have
refused him (<font color='blue'><b>Heathcliff</b></font>) herself? What was filling him (<font color='blue'><b>Heathcliff</b></font>) with dread we had no means of
discerning; but there he (<font color='blue'><b>Heathcliff</b></font>) was, powerless under its grip, and any addition
seemed capable of shocking him (<font color='blue'><b>Heathcliff</b></font>) into idiotcy. We reached the threshold;
Catherine walked in, and I stood waiting till she (<font color='blue'><b>Catherine</b></font>) had conducted the
invalid to a chair, expecting her (<font color='blue'><b>Catherine</b></font>) out immediately; when Mr. Heathcliff,
pushing me forward, exclaimed--<div class="bookquote">``My house is not stricken with the plague,
Nelly; and I have a mind to be hospitable to-day: sit down, and allow me
to shut the door.''

 (<font color='red'><b>me</b></font>)</div><p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Heathcliff</b></font>) shut and locked it also. I started.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``You shall have tea before you go home,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Heathcliff</b></font>) added. <div class="bookquote">``I am by myself.
Hareton is gone with some cattle to the Lees, and Zillah and Joseph are
off on a journey of pleasure; and, though I'm used to being alone, I'd
rather have some interesting company, if I can get it. Miss Linton, take
your seat by _him (<font color='blue'><b>Joseph</b></font>)_. I give you what I have: the present is hardly worth
accepting; but I have nothing else to offer. It is Linton, I mean. How
she (<font color='blue'><b>Linton</b></font>) does stare! It's odd what a savage feeling I have to anything that
seems afraid of me! Had I been born where laws are less strict and
tastes less dainty, I should treat myself to a slow vivisection of those
two, as an evening's amusement.''

 (<font color='red'><b>He</b></font>)</div><p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Heathcliff</b></font>) drew in his (<font color='blue'><b>Heathcliff</b></font>) breath, struck the table, and swore to himself, <div class="bookquote">``By hell!
I hate them.''

 (<font color='red'><b>He</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I am not afraid of you!''  (<font color='red'><b>Catherine/Earnshaw/Catherine Earnshaw</b></font>)</div>exclaimed Catherine, who could not hear the
latter part of his (<font color='blue'><b>Heathcliff</b></font>) speech. She (<font color='blue'><b>Catherine</b></font>) stepped close up; her (<font color='blue'><b>Catherine</b></font>) black eyes flashing
with passion and resolution. <div class="bookquote">``Give me that key: I will have it!''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Catherine</b></font>)
said. <div class="bookquote">``I wouldn't eat or drink here, if I were starving.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Heathcliff/Mr. Heathcliff</b></font>)</div><p/>Heathcliff had the key in his (<font color='blue'><b>Heathcliff</b></font>) hand that remained on the table. He (<font color='blue'><b>Heathcliff</b></font>) looked
up, seized with a sort of surprise at her (<font color='blue'><b>Catherine</b></font>) boldness; or, possibly,
reminded, by her (<font color='blue'><b>Catherine</b></font>) voice and glance, of the person from whom she (<font color='blue'><b>Catherine</b></font>) inherited
it. She (<font color='blue'><b>Catherine</b></font>) snatched at the instrument, and half succeeded in getting it out
of his (<font color='blue'><b>Heathcliff</b></font>) loosened fingers: but her (<font color='blue'><b>Catherine</b></font>) action recalled him (<font color='blue'><b>Heathcliff</b></font>) to the present; he (<font color='blue'><b>Heathcliff</b></font>)
recovered it speedily.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Now, Catherine Linton,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Heathcliff</b></font>) said, `stand off, or I shall knock you down;
and, that will make Mrs. Dean mad.''

<p/>Regardless of this warning, she (<font color='blue'><b>Dean</b></font>) captured his (<font color='blue'><b>Heathcliff</b></font>) closed hand and its contents
again. <div class="bookquote">``We _will_ go!''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Dean</b></font>) repeated, exerting her (<font color='blue'><b>Dean</b></font>) utmost efforts to cause
the iron muscles to relax; and finding that her (<font color='blue'><b>Dean</b></font>) nails made no impression,
she (<font color='blue'><b>Dean</b></font>) applied her (<font color='blue'><b>Dean</b></font>) teeth pretty sharply. Heathcliff glanced at me a glance
that kept me from interfering a moment. Catherine was too intent on his (<font color='blue'><b>Heathcliff</b></font>)
fingers to notice his (<font color='blue'><b>Heathcliff</b></font>) face. He (<font color='blue'><b>Heathcliff</b></font>) opened them suddenly, and resigned the
object of dispute; but, ere she (<font color='blue'><b>Catherine</b></font>) had well secured it, he (<font color='blue'><b>Heathcliff</b></font>) seized her (<font color='blue'><b>Catherine</b></font>) with
the liberated hand, and, pulling her (<font color='blue'><b>Catherine</b></font>) on his (<font color='blue'><b>Heathcliff</b></font>) knee, administered with the
other a shower of terrific slaps on both sides of the head, each
sufficient to have fulfilled his (<font color='blue'><b>Heathcliff</b></font>) threat, had she (<font color='blue'><b>Catherine</b></font>) been able to fall.

<p/>At this diabolical violence I rushed on him (<font color='blue'><b>Heathcliff</b></font>) furiously. <div class="bookquote">``You villain!''  (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div>I
began to cry, `you villain!'' A touch on the chest silenced me: I am
stout, and soon put out of breath; and, what with that and the rage, I
staggered dizzily back and felt ready to suffocate, or to burst a
blood-vessel. The scene was over in two minutes; Catherine, released,
put her (<font color='blue'><b>Catherine</b></font>) two hands to her (<font color='blue'><b>Catherine</b></font>) temples, and looked just as if she (<font color='blue'><b>Catherine</b></font>) were not
sure whether her (<font color='blue'><b>Catherine</b></font>) ears were off or on. She (<font color='blue'><b>Catherine</b></font>) trembled like a reed, poor
thing, and leant against the table perfectly bewildered.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``I know how to chastise children, you see,''  (<font color='red'><b>the scoundrel</b></font>)</div>said the scoundrel, grimly,
as he (<font color='blue'><b>scoundrel</b></font>) stooped to repossess himself of the key, which had dropped to the
floor. <div class="bookquote">``Go to Linton now, as I told you; and cry at your ease! I shall
be your father, to-morrow--all the father you'll have in a few days--and
you shall have plenty of that. You can bear plenty; you're no weakling:
you shall have a daily taste, if I catch such a devil of a temper in your
eyes again!''

 (<font color='red'><b>Cathy/Miss Cathy</b></font>)</div><p/>Cathy ran to me instead of Linton, and knelt down and put her (<font color='blue'><b>Linton</b></font>) burning
cheek on my lap, weeping aloud. Her (<font color='blue'><b>Linton</b></font>) cousin had shrunk into a corner of
the settle, as quiet as a mouse, congratulating himself, I dare say, that
the correction had alighted on another than him (<font color='blue'><b>cousin</b></font>). Mr. Heathcliff,
perceiving us all confounded, rose, and expeditiously made the tea
himself. The cups and saucers were laid ready. He (<font color='blue'><b>Heathcliff</b></font>) poured it out, and
handed me a cup.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Wash away your spleen,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Heathcliff</b></font>) said. <div class="bookquote">``And help your own naughty pet and
mine. It is not poisoned, though I prepared it. I'm going out to seek
your horses.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/>Our first thought, on his (<font color='blue'><b>Heathcliff</b></font>) departure, was to force an exit somewhere. We
tried the kitchen door, but that was fastened outside: we looked at the
windows--they were too narrow for even Cathy's little figure.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Master Linton,''  (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div>I cried, seeing we were regularly imprisoned, `you know
what your diabolical father is after, and you shall tell us, or I'll box
your ears, as he (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) has done your cousin<div class="bookquote">``s.''

 (<font color='red'><b>cousin Linton</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Yes, Linton, you must tell,''  (<font color='red'><b>cousin Linton</b></font>)</div>said Catherine. <div class="bookquote">``It was for your sake I
came; and it will be wickedly ungrateful if you refuse.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Give me some tea, I'm thirsty, and then I'll tell you,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) answered.
<div class="bookquote">``Mrs. Dean, go away. I don't like you standing over me. Now, Catherine,
you are letting your tears fall into my cup. I won't drink that. Give
me another.''  (<font color='red'><b>Catherine/Earnshaw/Catherine Earnshaw</b></font>)</div>Catherine pushed another to him (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>), and wiped her (<font color='blue'><b>Catherine</b></font>) face. I
felt disgusted at the little wretch's composure, since he (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) was no longer
in terror for himself. The anguish he (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) had exhibited on the moor subsided
as soon as ever he (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) entered Wuthering Heights; so I guessed he (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) had been
menaced with an awful visitation of wrath if he (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) failed in decoying us
there; and, that accomplished, he (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) had no further immediate fears.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Papa wants us to be married,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) continued, after sipping some of the
liquid. <div class="bookquote">``And he (<font color='blue'><b>Papa</b></font>) knows your papa wouldn't let us marry now; and he (<font color='blue'><b>papa</b></font>)'s
afraid of my dying if we wait; so we are to be married in the morning,
and you are to stay here all night; and, if you do as he (<font color='blue'><b>papa</b></font>) wishes, you
shall return home next day, and take me with you.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Take you with her (<font color='blue'><b>Catherine</b></font>), pitiful changeling!''  (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div>I exclaimed. '_You_ marry? Why,
the man is mad! or he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) thinks us fools, every one. And do you imagine
that beautiful young lady, that healthy, hearty girl, will tie herself to
a little perishing monkey like you? Are you cherishing the notion that
anybody, let alone Miss Catherine Linton, would have you for a husband?
You want whipping for bringing us in here at all, with your dastardly
puling tricks: and--don't look so silly, now! I've a very good mind to
shake you severely, for your contemptible treachery, and your imbecile
conceit.''

<p/>I did give him (<font color='blue'><b>imbecile</b></font>) a slight shaking; but it brought on the cough, and he (<font color='blue'><b>imbecile</b></font>) took
to his (<font color='blue'><b>imbecile</b></font>) ordinary resource of moaning and weeping, and Catherine rebuked
me.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Stay all night? No,''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Catherine</b></font>) said, looking slowly round. <div class="bookquote">``Ellen, I'll burn
that door down but I'll get out.''

 (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div><p/>And she (<font color='blue'><b>Catherine</b></font>) would have commenced the execution of her (<font color='blue'><b>Catherine</b></font>) threat directly, but
Linton was up in alarm for his (<font color='blue'><b>imbecile</b></font>) dear self again. He (<font color='blue'><b>imbecile</b></font>) clasped her (<font color='blue'><b>Linton</b></font>) in his (<font color='blue'><b>imbecile</b></font>)
two feeble arms sobbing:--<div class="bookquote">``Won't you have me, and save me? not let me
come to the Grange? Oh, darling Catherine! you mustn't go and leave,
after all. You _must_ obey my father--you _must_!''

 (<font color='red'><b>her</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I must obey my own,''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Linton</b></font>) replied, `and relieve him (<font color='blue'><b>imbecile</b></font>) from this cruel
suspense. The whole night! What would he (<font color='blue'><b>imbecile</b></font>) think? He (<font color='blue'><b>imbecile</b></font>)'ll be distressed
already. I'll either break or burn a way out of the house. Be quiet!
You're in no danger; but if you hinder me--Linton, I love papa better
than you!'' The mortal terror he (<font color='blue'><b>papa</b></font>) felt of Mr. Heathcliff's anger restored
to the boy his (<font color='blue'><b>papa</b></font>) coward's eloquence. Catherine was near distraught: still,
she (<font color='blue'><b>Catherine</b></font>) persisted that she (<font color='blue'><b>Catherine</b></font>) must go home, and tried entreaty in her (<font color='blue'><b>Catherine</b></font>) turn,
persuading him (<font color='blue'><b>papa</b></font>) to subdue his (<font color='blue'><b>papa</b></font>) selfish agony. While they were thus
occupied, our jailor re-entered.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Your beasts have trotted off,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>papa</b></font>) said, `and--now Linton! snivelling
again? What has she (<font color='blue'><b>Linton</b></font>) been doing to you? Come, come--have done, and get
to bed. In a month or two, my lad, you'll be able to pay her (<font color='blue'><b>Linton</b></font>) back her (<font color='blue'><b>Linton</b></font>)
present tyrannies with a vigorous hand. You're pining for pure love, are
you not? nothing else in the world: and she (<font color='blue'><b>Linton</b></font>) shall have you! There, to
bed! Zillah won't be here to-night; you must undress yourself. Hush!
hold your noise! Once in your own room, I'll not come near you: you
needn't fear. By chance, you've managed tolerably. I'll look to the
rest.''

<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>lad</b></font>) spoke these words, holding the door open for his (<font color='blue'><b>lad</b></font>) son to pass, and the
latter achieved his (<font color='blue'><b>lad</b></font>) exit exactly as a spaniel might which suspected the
person who attended on it of designing a spiteful squeeze. The lock was
re-secured. Heathcliff approached the fire, where my mistress and I
stood silent. Catherine looked up, and instinctively raised her (<font color='blue'><b>Catherine</b></font>) hand to
her (<font color='blue'><b>Catherine</b></font>) cheek: his (<font color='blue'><b>Heathcliff</b></font>) neighbourhood revived a painful sensation. Anybody else
would have been incapable of regarding the childish act with sternness,
but he (<font color='blue'><b>Heathcliff</b></font>) scowled on her (<font color='blue'><b>Catherine</b></font>) and muttered--<div class="bookquote">``Oh! you are not afraid of me? Your
courage is well disguised: you seem damnably afraid!''

 (<font color='red'><b>her</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I _am_ afraid now,''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Catherine</b></font>) replied, `because, if I stay, papa will be
miserable: and how can I endure making him (<font color='blue'><b>Heathcliff</b></font>) miserable--when he (<font color='blue'><b>Heathcliff</b></font>)--when
he (<font color='blue'><b>Heathcliff</b></font>)--Mr. Heathcliff, let _me_ go home! I promise to marry Linton: papa
would like me to: and I love him (<font color='blue'><b>papa</b></font>). Why should you wish to force me to do
what I'll willingly do of myself?''

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Let him (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) dare to force you,''  (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div>I cried. <div class="bookquote">``There's law in the land, thank
God! there is; though we be in an out-of-the-way place. I'd inform if he (<font color='blue'><b>God</b></font>)
were my own son: and it's felony without benefit of clergy!''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Silence!''  (<font color='red'><b>the ruffian</b></font>)</div>said the ruffian. <div class="bookquote">``To the devil with your clamour! I don't
want _you_ to speak. Miss Linton, I shall enjoy myself remarkably in
thinking your father will be miserable: I shall not sleep for
satisfaction. You could have hit on no surer way of fixing your
residence under my roof for the next twenty-four hours than informing me
that such an event would follow. As to your promise to marry Linton,
I'll take care you shall keep it; for you shall not quit this place till
it is fulfilled.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Send Ellen, then, to let papa know I'm safe!''  (<font color='red'><b>Catherine/Earnshaw/Catherine Earnshaw</b></font>)</div>exclaimed Catherine,
weeping bitterly. <div class="bookquote">``Or marry me now. Poor papa! Ellen, he (<font color='blue'><b>papa</b></font>)'ll think
we're lost. What shall we do?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Not he (<font color='blue'><b>papa</b></font>)! He (<font color='blue'><b>papa</b></font>)'ll think you are tired of waiting on him (<font color='blue'><b>papa</b></font>), and run off for a
little amusement,''  (<font color='red'><b>Heathcliff/Mr. Heathcliff</b></font>)</div>answered Heathcliff. <div class="bookquote">``You cannot deny that you
entered my house of your own accord, in contempt of his (<font color='blue'><b>papa</b></font>) injunctions to
the contrary. And it is quite natural that you should desire amusement
at your age; and that you would weary of nursing a sick man, and that man
_only_ your father. Catherine, his (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) happiest days were over when your
days began. He (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) cursed you, I dare say, for coming into the world -LRB-I did,
at least-RRB-; and it would just do if he (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) cursed you as _he (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>)_ went out of it.
I'd join him (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>). I don't love you! How should I? Weep away. As far as I
can see, it will be your chief diversion hereafter; unless Linton make
amends for other losses: and your provident parent appears to fancy he (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>)
may. His (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) letters of advice and consolation entertained me vastly. In
his (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) last he (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) recommended my jewel to be careful of his (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>); and kind to her (<font color='blue'><b>Linton</b></font>)
when he (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) got her (<font color='blue'><b>Linton</b></font>). Careful and kind--that's paternal. But Linton requires
his (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) whole stock of care and kindness for himself. Linton can play the
little tyrant well. He (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>)'ll undertake to torture any number of cats, if
their teeth be drawn and their claws pared. You'll be able to tell his (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>)
uncle fine tales of his (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) _kindness_, when you get home again, I assure
you.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``You're right there!''  (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div>I said; `explain your son's character. Show his (<font color='blue'><b>Heathcliff</b></font>)
resemblance to yourself: and then, I hope, Miss Cathy will think twice
before she (<font color='blue'><b>Cathy</b></font>) takes the cockatrice!''

<p/><div class="bookquote">``I don't much mind speaking of his (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) amiable qualities now,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Heathcliff</b></font>) answered;
`because she (<font color='blue'><b>Cathy</b></font>) must either accept him (<font color='blue'><b>Heathcliff</b></font>) or remain a prisoner, and you along
with her (<font color='blue'><b>Cathy</b></font>), till your master dies. I can detain you both, quite concealed,
here. If you doubt, encourage her (<font color='blue'><b>Cathy</b></font>) to retract her (<font color='blue'><b>Cathy</b></font>) word, and you'll have
an opportunity of judging!''

<p/><div class="bookquote">``I'll not retract my word,''  (<font color='red'><b>Catherine/Earnshaw/Catherine Earnshaw</b></font>)</div>said Catherine. <div class="bookquote">``I'll marry him (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) within this
hour, if I may go to Thrushcross Grange afterwards. Mr. Heathcliff,
you're a cruel man, but you're not a fiend; and you won't, from _mere_
malice, destroy irrevocably all my happiness. If papa thought I had left
him (<font color='blue'><b>papa</b></font>) on purpose, and if he (<font color='blue'><b>papa</b></font>) died before I returned, could I bear to live?
I've given over crying: but I'm going to kneel here, at your knee; and
I'll not get up, and I'll not take my eyes from your face till you look
back at me! No, don't turn away! _do look_! you'll see nothing to
provoke you. I don't hate you. I'm not angry that you struck me. Have
you never loved _anybody_ in all your life, uncle? _never_? Ah! you must
look once. I'm so wretched, you can't help being sorry and pitying me.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Keep your eft's fingers off; and move, or I'll kick you!''  (<font color='red'><b>Heathcliff/Mr. Heathcliff</b></font>)</div>cried
Heathcliff, brutally repulsing her (<font color='blue'><b>Catherine</b></font>). <div class="bookquote">``I'd rather be hugged by a snake.
How the devil can you dream of fawning on me? I _detest_ you!''

 (<font color='red'><b>He</b></font>)</div><p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Heathcliff</b></font>) shrugged his (<font color='blue'><b>Heathcliff</b></font>) shoulders: shook himself, indeed, as if his (<font color='blue'><b>Heathcliff</b></font>) flesh crept
with aversion; and thrust back his (<font color='blue'><b>Heathcliff</b></font>) chair; while I got up, and opened my
mouth, to commence a downright torrent of abuse. But I was rendered dumb
in the middle of the first sentence, by a threat that I should be shown
into a room by myself the very next syllable I uttered. It was growing
dark--we heard a sound of voices at the garden-gate. Our host hurried
out instantly: _he (<font color='blue'><b>Heathcliff</b></font>)_ had his (<font color='blue'><b>Heathcliff</b></font>) wits about him (<font color='blue'><b>Heathcliff</b></font>); _we_ had not. There was a
talk of two or three minutes, and he (<font color='blue'><b>Heathcliff</b></font>) returned alone.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``I thought it had been your cousin Hareton,''  (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div>I observed to Catherine. <div class="bookquote">``I
wish he (<font color='blue'><b>Hareton</b></font>) would arrive! Who knows but he (<font color='blue'><b>Hareton</b></font>) might take our part?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``It was three servants sent to seek you from the Grange,''  (<font color='red'><b>Heathcliff/Mr. Heathcliff</b></font>)</div>said
Heathcliff, overhearing me. <div class="bookquote">``You should have opened a lattice and called
out: but I could swear that chit is glad you didn't. She (<font color='blue'><b>Hareton</b></font>)'s glad to be
obliged to stay, I'm certain.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/>At learning the chance we had missed, we both gave vent to our grief
without control; and he (<font color='blue'><b>Heathcliff</b></font>) allowed us to wail on till nine o'clock. Then he (<font color='blue'><b>Heathcliff</b></font>)
bid us go upstairs, through the kitchen, to Zillah's chamber; and I
whispered my companion to obey: perhaps we might contrive to get through
the window there, or into a garret, and out by its skylight. The window,
however, was narrow, like those below, and the garret trap was safe from
our attempts; for we were fastened in as before. We neither of us lay
down: Catherine took her (<font color='blue'><b>Catherine</b></font>) station by the lattice, and watched anxiously
for morning; a deep sigh being the only answer I could obtain to my
frequent entreaties that she (<font color='blue'><b>Catherine</b></font>) would try to rest. I seated myself in a
chair, and rocked to and fro, passing harsh judgment on my many
derelictions of duty; from which, it struck me then, all the misfortunes
of my employers sprang. It was not the case, in reality, I am aware; but
it was, in my imagination, that dismal night; and I thought Heathcliff
himself less guilty than I.

<p/>At seven o'clock he (<font color='blue'><b>Heathcliff</b></font>) came, and inquired if Miss Linton had risen. She (<font color='blue'><b>Linton</b></font>) ran
to the door immediately, and answered, <div class="bookquote">``Yes.''  (<font color='red'><b>She</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``Here, then,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Heathcliff</b></font>) said,
opening it, and pulling her (<font color='blue'><b>Linton</b></font>) out. I rose to follow, but he (<font color='blue'><b>Heathcliff</b></font>) turned the
lock again. I demanded my release.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Be patient,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Heathcliff</b></font>) replied; <div class="bookquote">``I'll send up your breakfast in a while.''

 (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div><p/>I thumped on the panels, and rattled the latch angrily and Catherine
asked why I was still shut up? He (<font color='blue'><b>Heathcliff</b></font>) answered, I must try to endure it
another hour, and they went away. I endured it two or three hours; at
length, I heard a footstep: not Heathcliff's.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``I've brought you something to eat,''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>said a voice; `oppen t' door!''

<p/>Complying eagerly, I beheld Hareton, laden with food enough to last me
all day.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Tak' it,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Heathcliff</b></font>) added, thrusting the tray into my hand.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Stay one minute,''  (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div>I began.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Nay,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>cried he (<font color='blue'><b>Heathcliff</b></font>), and retired, regardless of any prayers I could pour
forth to detain him (<font color='blue'><b>Heathcliff</b></font>).

<p/>And there I remained enclosed the whole day, and the whole of the next
night; and another, and another. Five nights and four days I remained,
altogether, seeing nobody but Hareton once every morning; and he (<font color='blue'><b>Hareton</b></font>) was a
model of a jailor: surly, and dumb, and deaf to every attempt at moving
his (<font color='blue'><b>Hareton</b></font>) sense of justice or compassion.




<p/>CHAPTER XXVIII


<p/>On the fifth morning, or rather afternoon, a different step
approached--lighter and shorter; and, this time, the person entered the
room. It was Zillah; donned in her (<font color='blue'><b>Zillah</b></font>) scarlet shawl, with a black silk
bonnet on her (<font color='blue'><b>Zillah</b></font>) head, and a willow-basket swung to her (<font color='blue'><b>Zillah</b></font>) arm.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Eh, dear! Mrs. Dean!''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Zillah</b></font>) exclaimed. <div class="bookquote">``Well! there is a talk about you
at Gimmerton. I never thought but you were sunk in the Blackhorse marsh,
and missy with you, till master told me you'd been found, and he (<font color='blue'><b>master</b></font>)'d lodged
you here! What! and you must have got on an island, sure? And how long
were you in the hole? Did master save you, Mrs. Dean? But you're not so
thin--you've not been so poorly, have you?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Your master is a true scoundrel!''  (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div>I replied. <div class="bookquote">``But he (<font color='blue'><b>master</b></font>) shall answer for
it. He (<font color='blue'><b>master</b></font>) needn't have raised that tale: it shall all be laid bare!''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``What do you mean?''  (<font color='red'><b>Zillah</b></font>)</div>asked Zillah. ``It's not his (<font color='blue'><b>master</b></font>) tale: they tell that in
the village--about your being lost in the marsh; and I calls to Earnshaw,
when I come in--``Eh, they's queer things, Mr. Hareton, happened since I
went off. It's a sad pity of that likely young lass, and cant Nelly
Dean.'' He (<font color='blue'><b>Hareton</b></font>) stared. I thought he (<font color='blue'><b>Hareton</b></font>) had not heard aught, so I told him (<font color='blue'><b>Hareton</b></font>) the
rumour. The master listened, and he (<font color='blue'><b>master</b></font>) just smiled to himself, and said,
<div class="bookquote">``If they have been in the marsh, they are out now, Zillah. Nelly Dean is
lodged, at this minute, in your room. You can tell her (<font color='blue'><b>lass</b></font>) to flit, when you
go up; here is the key. The bog-water got into her (<font color='blue'><b>lass</b></font>) head, and she (<font color='blue'><b>lass</b></font>) would
have run home quite flighty; but I fixed her (<font color='blue'><b>lass</b></font>) till she (<font color='blue'><b>lass</b></font>) came round to her (<font color='blue'><b>lass</b></font>)
senses. You can bid her (<font color='blue'><b>lass</b></font>) go to the Grange at once, if she (<font color='blue'><b>lass</b></font>) be able, and
carry a message from me, that her (<font color='blue'><b>lass</b></font>) young lady will follow in time to
attend the squire's funeral.'' (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>'

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Mr. Edgar is not dead?''  (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div>I gasped. <div class="bookquote">``Oh! Zillah, Zillah!''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``No, no; sit you down, my good mistress,''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Zillah</b></font>) replied; `you're right
sickly yet. He (<font color='blue'><b>master</b></font>)'s not dead; Doctor Kenneth thinks he (<font color='blue'><b>Kenneth</b></font>) may last another
day. I met him (<font color='blue'><b>Kenneth</b></font>) on the road and asked.''

<p/>Instead of sitting down, I snatched my outdoor things, and hastened
below, for the way was free. On entering the house, I looked about for
some one to give information of Catherine. The place was filled with
sunshine, and the door stood wide open; but nobody seemed at hand. As I
hesitated whether to go off at once, or return and seek my mistress, a
slight cough drew my attention to the hearth. Linton lay on the settle,
sole tenant, sucking a stick of sugar-candy, and pursuing my movements
with apathetic eyes. <div class="bookquote">``Where is Miss Catherine?''  (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div>I demanded sternly,
supposing I could frighten him (<font color='blue'><b>mistress</b></font>) into giving intelligence, by catching him (<font color='blue'><b>mistress</b></font>)
thus, alone. He (<font color='blue'><b>mistress</b></font>) sucked on like an innocent.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Is she (<font color='blue'><b>Catherine</b></font>) gone?''  (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div>I said.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``No,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>mistress</b></font>) replied; `she (<font color='blue'><b>Linton</b></font>)'s upstairs: she (<font color='blue'><b>Linton</b></font>)'s not to go; we won't let her (<font color='blue'><b>Linton</b></font>).''

<p/><div class="bookquote">``You won't let her (<font color='blue'><b>Catherine</b></font>), little idiot!''  (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div>I exclaimed. <div class="bookquote">``Direct me to her (<font color='blue'><b>Catherine</b></font>) room
immediately, or I'll make you sing out sharply.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Papa would make you sing out, if you attempted to get there,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>mistress</b></font>)
answered. <div class="bookquote">``He (<font color='blue'><b>Papa</b></font>) says I'm not to be soft with Catherine: she (<font color='blue'><b>Catherine</b></font>)'s my wife, and
it's shameful that she (<font color='blue'><b>Catherine</b></font>) should wish to leave me. He (<font color='blue'><b>Papa</b></font>) says she (<font color='blue'><b>Catherine</b></font>) hates me and
wants me to die, that she (<font color='blue'><b>Catherine</b></font>) may have my money; but she (<font color='blue'><b>Catherine</b></font>) shan't have it: and
she (<font color='blue'><b>Catherine</b></font>) shan't go home! She (<font color='blue'><b>Catherine</b></font>) never shall!--she (<font color='blue'><b>Catherine</b></font>) may cry, and be sick as much
as she (<font color='blue'><b>Catherine</b></font>) pleases!''

 (<font color='red'><b>He</b></font>)</div><p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>mistress</b></font>) resumed his (<font color='blue'><b>mistress</b></font>) former occupation, closing his (<font color='blue'><b>mistress</b></font>) lids, as if he (<font color='blue'><b>mistress</b></font>) meant to
drop asleep.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Master Heathcliff,''  (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div>I resumed, `have you forgotten all Catherine's
kindness to you last winter, when you affirmed you loved her (<font color='blue'><b>Catherine</b></font>), and when
she (<font color='blue'><b>Catherine</b></font>) brought you books and sung you songs, and came many a time through
wind and snow to see you? She (<font color='blue'><b>Catherine</b></font>) wept to miss one evening, because you
would be disappointed; and you felt then that she (<font color='blue'><b>Catherine</b></font>) was a hundred times too
good to you: and now you believe the lies your father tells, though you
know he (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) detests you both. And you join him (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) against her (<font color='blue'><b>Catherine</b></font>). That's fine
gratitude, is it not?''

<p/>The corner of Linton's mouth fell, and he (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) took the sugar-candy from his (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>)
lips.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Did she (<font color='blue'><b>Catherine</b></font>) come to Wuthering Heights because she (<font color='blue'><b>Catherine</b></font>) hated you?''  (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div>I continued.
<div class="bookquote">``Think for yourself! As to your money, she (<font color='blue'><b>Catherine</b></font>) does not even know that you
will have any. And you say she (<font color='blue'><b>Catherine</b></font>)'s sick; and yet you leave her (<font color='blue'><b>Catherine</b></font>) alone, up
there in a strange house! You who have felt what it is to be so
neglected! You could pity your own sufferings; and she (<font color='blue'><b>Catherine</b></font>) pitied them, too;
but you won't pity hers! I shed tears, Master Heathcliff, you see--an
elderly woman, and a servant merely--and you, after pretending such
affection, and having reason to worship her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) almost, store every tear you
have for yourself, and lie there quite at ease. Ah! you're a heartless,
selfish boy!''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I can't stay with her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>),''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) answered crossly. <div class="bookquote">``I'll not stay by myself.
She (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) cries so I can't bear it. And she (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) won't give over, though I say I'll
call my father. I did call him (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) once, and he (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) threatened to strangle her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>)
if she (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) was not quiet; but she (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) began again the instant he (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) left the room,
moaning and grieving all night long, though I screamed for vexation that
I couldn't sleep.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Is Mr. Heathcliff out?''  (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div>I inquired, perceiving that the wretched
creature had no power to sympathize with his (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) cousin's mental tortures.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``He (<font color='blue'><b>Heathcliff</b></font>)'s in the court,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) replied, `talking to Doctor Kenneth; who says
uncle is dying, truly, at last. I'm glad, for I shall be master of the
Grange after him (<font color='blue'><b>master</b></font>). Catherine always spoke of it as her (<font color='blue'><b>Catherine</b></font>) house. It isn't
hers! It's mine: papa says everything she (<font color='blue'><b>Catherine</b></font>) has is mine. All her (<font color='blue'><b>Catherine</b></font>) nice
books are mine; she (<font color='blue'><b>Catherine</b></font>) offered to give me them, and her (<font color='blue'><b>Catherine</b></font>) pretty birds, and
her (<font color='blue'><b>Catherine</b></font>) pony Minny, if I would get the key of our room, and let her (<font color='blue'><b>Catherine</b></font>) out; but
I told her (<font color='blue'><b>Catherine</b></font>) she (<font color='blue'><b>Catherine</b></font>) had nothing to give, they were all, all mine. And then
she (<font color='blue'><b>Catherine</b></font>) cried, and took a little picture from her (<font color='blue'><b>Catherine</b></font>) neck, and said I should
have that; two pictures in a gold case, on one side her (<font color='blue'><b>Catherine</b></font>) mother, and on
the other uncle, when they were young. That was yesterday--I said they
were mine, too; and tried to get them from her (<font color='blue'><b>Catherine</b></font>). The spiteful thing
wouldn't let me: she (<font color='blue'><b>Catherine</b></font>) pushed me off, and hurt me. I shrieked out--that
frightens her (<font color='blue'><b>Catherine</b></font>)--she (<font color='blue'><b>Catherine</b></font>) heard papa coming, and she (<font color='blue'><b>Catherine</b></font>) broke the hinges and
divided the case, and gave me her (<font color='blue'><b>Catherine</b></font>) mother's portrait; the other she (<font color='blue'><b>Catherine</b></font>)
attempted to hide: but papa asked what was the matter, and I explained
it. He (<font color='blue'><b>papa</b></font>) took the one I had away, and ordered her (<font color='blue'><b>Catherine</b></font>) to resign hers to me;
she (<font color='blue'><b>Catherine</b></font>) refused, and he (<font color='blue'><b>papa</b></font>)--he (<font color='blue'><b>papa</b></font>) struck her (<font color='blue'><b>Catherine</b></font>) down, and wrenched it off the chain,
and crushed it with his (<font color='blue'><b>papa</b></font>) foot.''

<p/><div class="bookquote">``And were you pleased to see her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) struck?''  (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div>I asked: having my designs in
encouraging his (<font color='blue'><b>papa</b></font>) talk.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``I winked,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>papa</b></font>) answered: <div class="bookquote">``I wink to see my father strike a dog or a
horse, he (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) does it so hard. Yet I was glad at first--she (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) deserved
punishing for pushing me: but when papa was gone, she (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) made me come to the
window and showed me her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) cheek cut on the inside, against her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) teeth, and
her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) mouth filling with blood; and then she (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) gathered up the bits of the
picture, and went and sat down with her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) face to the wall, and she (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) has
never spoken to me since: and I sometimes think she (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) can't speak for pain.
I don't like to think so; but she (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>)'s a naughty thing for crying
continually; and she (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) looks so pale and wild, I'm afraid of her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>).''

 (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``And you can get the key if you choose?''  (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div>I said.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Yes, when I am up-stairs,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>papa</b></font>) answered; `but I can't walk up-stairs
now.''

<p/><div class="bookquote">``In what apartment is it?''  (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div>I asked.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Oh,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>papa</b></font>) cried, <div class="bookquote">``I shan't tell _you_ where it is. It is our secret.
Nobody, neither Hareton nor Zillah, is to know. There! you've tired
me--go away, go away!''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>And he (<font color='blue'><b>papa</b></font>) turned his (<font color='blue'><b>papa</b></font>) face on to his (<font color='blue'><b>papa</b></font>) arm, and shut
his (<font color='blue'><b>papa</b></font>) eyes again.

<p/>I considered it best to depart without seeing Mr. Heathcliff, and bring a
rescue for my young lady from the Grange. On reaching it, the
astonishment of my fellow-servants to see me, and their joy also, was
intense; and when they heard that their little mistress was safe, two or
three were about to hurry up and shout the news at Mr. Edgar's door: but
I bespoke the announcement of it myself. How changed I found him (<font color='blue'><b>Edgar</b></font>), even
in those few days! He (<font color='blue'><b>Edgar</b></font>) lay an image of sadness and resignation awaiting
his (<font color='blue'><b>Edgar</b></font>) death. Very young he (<font color='blue'><b>Edgar</b></font>) looked: though his (<font color='blue'><b>Edgar</b></font>) actual age was thirty-nine,
one would have called him (<font color='blue'><b>Edgar</b></font>) ten years younger, at least. He (<font color='blue'><b>Edgar</b></font>) thought of
Catherine; for he (<font color='blue'><b>Edgar</b></font>) murmured her (<font color='blue'><b>Catherine</b></font>) name. I touched his (<font color='blue'><b>Edgar</b></font>) hand, and spoke.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Catherine is coming, dear master!''  (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div>I whispered; `she (<font color='blue'><b>Catherine</b></font>) is alive and well;
and will be here, I hope, to-night.''

<p/>I trembled at the first effects of this intelligence: he (<font color='blue'><b>Edgar</b></font>) half rose up,
looked eagerly round the apartment, and then sank back in a swoon. As
soon as he (<font color='blue'><b>Edgar</b></font>) recovered, I related our compulsory visit, and detention at
the Heights. I said Heathcliff forced me to go in: which was not quite
true. I uttered as little as possible against Linton; nor did I describe
all his (<font color='blue'><b>Heathcliff</b></font>) father's brutal conduct--my intentions being to add no
bitterness, if I could help it, to his (<font color='blue'><b>Heathcliff</b></font>) already over-flowing cup.

<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Heathcliff</b></font>) divined that one of his (<font color='blue'><b>Heathcliff</b></font>) enemy's purposes was to secure the personal
property, as well as the estate, to his (<font color='blue'><b>Heathcliff</b></font>) son: or rather himself; yet why
he (<font color='blue'><b>Heathcliff</b></font>) did not wait till his (<font color='blue'><b>Heathcliff</b></font>) decease was a puzzle to my master, because
ignorant how nearly he (<font color='blue'><b>Heathcliff</b></font>) and his (<font color='blue'><b>Heathcliff</b></font>) nephew would quit the world together.
However, he (<font color='blue'><b>Heathcliff</b></font>) felt that his (<font color='blue'><b>Heathcliff</b></font>) will had better be altered: instead of leaving
Catherine's fortune at her (<font color='blue'><b>Catherine</b></font>) own disposal, he (<font color='blue'><b>Heathcliff</b></font>) determined to put it in the
hands of trustees for her (<font color='blue'><b>Catherine</b></font>) use during life, and for her (<font color='blue'><b>Catherine</b></font>) children, if she (<font color='blue'><b>Catherine</b></font>)
had any, after her (<font color='blue'><b>Catherine</b></font>). By that means, it could not fall to Mr. Heathcliff
should Linton die.

<p/>Having received his (<font color='blue'><b>Heathcliff</b></font>) orders, I despatched a man to fetch the attorney, and
four more, provided with serviceable weapons, to demand my young lady of
her (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) jailor. Both parties were delayed very late. The single servant
returned first. He (<font color='blue'><b>servant</b></font>) said Mr. Green, the lawyer, was out when he (<font color='blue'><b>Green</b></font>) arrived
at his (<font color='blue'><b>Green</b></font>) house, and he (<font color='blue'><b>Green</b></font>) had to wait two hours for his (<font color='blue'><b>Green</b></font>) re-entrance; and then
Mr. Green told him (<font color='blue'><b>Green</b></font>) he (<font color='blue'><b>Green</b></font>) had a little business in the village that must be
done; but he (<font color='blue'><b>Green</b></font>) would be at Thrushcross Grange before morning. The four men
came back unaccompanied also. They brought word that Catherine was ill:
too ill to quit her (<font color='blue'><b>Catherine</b></font>) room; and Heathcliff would not suffer them to see
her (<font color='blue'><b>Catherine</b></font>). I scolded the stupid fellows well for listening to that tale, which
I would not carry to my master; resolving to take a whole bevy up to the
Heights, at day-light, and storm it literally, unless the prisoner were
quietly surrendered to us. Her (<font color='blue'><b>Catherine</b></font>) father _shall_ see her (<font color='blue'><b>Catherine</b></font>), I vowed, and
vowed again, if that devil be killed on his (<font color='blue'><b>devil</b></font>) own doorstones in trying to
prevent it!

<p/>Happily, I was spared the journey and the trouble. I had gone
down-stairs at three o'clock to fetch a jug of water; and was passing
through the hall with it in my hand, when a sharp knock at the front door
made me jump. <div class="bookquote">``Oh! it is Green,''  (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div>I said, recollecting myself--`only
Green,'' and I went on, intending to send somebody else to open it; but
the knock was repeated: not loud, and still importunately. I put the jug
on the banister and hastened to admit him (<font color='blue'><b>Green</b></font>) myself. The harvest moon shone
clear outside. It was not the attorney. My own sweet little mistress
sprang on my neck sobbing, <div class="bookquote">``Ellen, Ellen! Is papa alive?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Yes,''  (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div>I cried: `yes, my angel, he (<font color='blue'><b>angel</b></font>) is, God be thanked, you are safe with
us again!''

<p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>mistress</b></font>) wanted to run, breathless as she (<font color='blue'><b>mistress</b></font>) was, up-stairs to Mr. Linton's room;
but I compelled her (<font color='blue'><b>mistress</b></font>) to sit down on a chair, and made her (<font color='blue'><b>mistress</b></font>) drink, and
washed her (<font color='blue'><b>mistress</b></font>) pale face, chafing it into a faint colour with my apron. Then
I said I must go first, and tell of her (<font color='blue'><b>mistress</b></font>) arrival; imploring her (<font color='blue'><b>mistress</b></font>) to say,
she (<font color='blue'><b>mistress</b></font>) should be happy with young Heathcliff. She (<font color='blue'><b>mistress</b></font>) stared, but soon
comprehending why I counselled her (<font color='blue'><b>mistress</b></font>) to utter the falsehood, she (<font color='blue'><b>mistress</b></font>) assured me
she (<font color='blue'><b>mistress</b></font>) would not complain.

<p/>I couldn't abide to be present at their meeting. I stood outside the
chamber-door a quarter of an hour, and hardly ventured near the bed,
then. All was composed, however: Catherine's despair was as silent as
her (<font color='blue'><b>Catherine</b></font>) father's joy. She (<font color='blue'><b>Catherine</b></font>) supported him (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) calmly, in appearance; and he (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) fixed
on her (<font color='blue'><b>Catherine</b></font>) features his (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) raised eyes that seemed dilating with ecstasy.

<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) died blissfully, Mr. Lockwood: he (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) died so. Kissing her (<font color='blue'><b>Catherine</b></font>) cheek, he (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>)
murmured,--<div class="bookquote">``I am going to her (<font color='blue'><b>Ellen</b></font>); and you, darling child, shall come to us!''
 (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>and never stirred or spoke again; but continued that rapt, radiant gaze,
till his (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) pulse imperceptibly stopped and his (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) soul departed. None could
have noticed the exact minute of his (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) death, it was so entirely without a
struggle.

<p/>Whether Catherine had spent her (<font color='blue'><b>Catherine</b></font>) tears, or whether the grief were too
weighty to let them flow, she (<font color='blue'><b>Catherine</b></font>) sat there dry-eyed till the sun rose: she (<font color='blue'><b>Catherine</b></font>)
sat till noon, and would still have remained brooding over that deathbed,
but I insisted on her (<font color='blue'><b>Catherine</b></font>) coming away and taking some repose. It was well I
succeeded in removing her (<font color='blue'><b>Catherine</b></font>), for at dinner-time appeared the lawyer, having
called at Wuthering Heights to get his (<font color='blue'><b>lawyer</b></font>) instructions how to behave. He (<font color='blue'><b>lawyer</b></font>)
had sold himself to Mr. Heathcliff: that was the cause of his (<font color='blue'><b>Heathcliff</b></font>) delay in
obeying my master's summons. Fortunately, no thought of worldly affairs
crossed the latter's mind, to disturb him (<font color='blue'><b>Heathcliff</b></font>), after his (<font color='blue'><b>Heathcliff</b></font>) daughter's arrival.

<p/>Mr. Green took upon himself to order everything and everybody about the
place. He (<font color='blue'><b>Green</b></font>) gave all the servants but me, notice to quit. He (<font color='blue'><b>Green</b></font>) would have
carried his (<font color='blue'><b>Green</b></font>) delegated authority to the point of insisting that Edgar
Linton should not be buried beside his (<font color='blue'><b>Linton</b></font>) wife, but in the chapel, with his (<font color='blue'><b>Linton</b></font>)
family. There was the will, however, to hinder that, and my loud
protestations against any infringement of its directions. The funeral
was hurried over; Catherine, Mrs. Linton Heathcliff now, was suffered to
stay at the Grange till her (<font color='blue'><b>Catherine</b></font>) father's corpse had quitted it.

<p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>Catherine</b></font>) told me that her (<font color='blue'><b>Catherine</b></font>) anguish had at last spurred Linton to incur the risk
of liberating her (<font color='blue'><b>Linton</b></font>). She (<font color='blue'><b>Linton</b></font>) heard the men I sent disputing at the door, and
she (<font color='blue'><b>Linton</b></font>) gathered the sense of Heathcliff's answer. It drove her (<font color='blue'><b>Linton</b></font>) desperate.
Linton who had been conveyed up to the little parlour soon after I left,
was terrified into fetching the key before his (<font color='blue'><b>Heathcliff</b></font>) father re-ascended. He (<font color='blue'><b>Heathcliff</b></font>)
had the cunning to unlock and re-lock the door, without shutting it; and
when he (<font color='blue'><b>Heathcliff</b></font>) should have gone to bed, he (<font color='blue'><b>Heathcliff</b></font>) begged to sleep with Hareton, and his (<font color='blue'><b>Heathcliff</b></font>)
petition was granted for once. Catherine stole out before break of day.
She (<font color='blue'><b>Catherine</b></font>) dared not try the doors lest the dogs should raise an alarm; she (<font color='blue'><b>Catherine</b></font>)
visited the empty chambers and examined their windows; and, luckily,
lighting on her (<font color='blue'><b>Catherine</b></font>) mother's, she (<font color='blue'><b>Catherine</b></font>) got easily out of its lattice, and on to
the ground, by means of the fir-tree close by. Her (<font color='blue'><b>Catherine</b></font>) accomplice suffered
for his (<font color='blue'><b>accomplice</b></font>) share in the escape, notwithstanding his (<font color='blue'><b>accomplice</b></font>) timid contrivances.




<p/>CHAPTER XXIX


<p/>The evening after the funeral, my young lady and I were seated in the
library; now musing mournfully--one of us despairingly--on our loss, now
venturing conjectures as to the gloomy future.

<p/>We had just agreed the best destiny which could await Catherine would be
a permission to continue resident at the Grange; at least during Linton's
life: he (<font color='blue'><b>resident</b></font>) being allowed to join her (<font color='blue'><b>Linton</b></font>) there, and I to remain as housekeeper.
That seemed rather too favourable an arrangement to be hoped for; and yet
I did hope, and began to cheer up under the prospect of retaining my home
and my employment, and, above all, my beloved young mistress; when a
servant--one of the discarded ones, not yet departed--rushed hastily in,
and said `that devil Heathcliff' was coming through the court: should he (<font color='blue'><b>Heathcliff</b></font>)
fasten the door in his (<font color='blue'><b>Heathcliff</b></font>) face?

<p/>If we had been mad enough to order that proceeding, we had not time. He (<font color='blue'><b>Heathcliff</b></font>)
made no ceremony of knocking or announcing his (<font color='blue'><b>Heathcliff</b></font>) name: he (<font color='blue'><b>Heathcliff</b></font>) was master, and
availed himself of the master's privilege to walk straight in, without
saying a word. The sound of our informant's voice directed him (<font color='blue'><b>informant</b></font>) to the
library; he (<font color='blue'><b>informant</b></font>) entered and motioning him (<font color='blue'><b>informant</b></font>) out, shut the door.

<p/>It was the same room into which he (<font color='blue'><b>informant</b></font>) had been ushered, as a guest, eighteen
years before: the same moon shone through the window; and the same autumn
landscape lay outside. We had not yet lighted a candle, but all the
apartment was visible, even to the portraits on the wall: the splendid
head of Mrs. Linton, and the graceful one of her (<font color='blue'><b>Linton</b></font>) husband. Heathcliff
advanced to the hearth. Time had little altered his (<font color='blue'><b>Heathcliff</b></font>) person either. There
was the same man: his (<font color='blue'><b>Heathcliff</b></font>) dark face rather sallower and more composed, his (<font color='blue'><b>Heathcliff</b></font>)
frame a stone or two heavier, perhaps, and no other difference. Catherine
had risen with an impulse to dash out, when she (<font color='blue'><b>Catherine</b></font>) saw him (<font color='blue'><b>Heathcliff</b></font>).

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Stop!''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Heathcliff</b></font>) said, arresting her (<font color='blue'><b>Catherine</b></font>) by the arm. <div class="bookquote">``No more runnings away! Where
would you go? I'm come to fetch you home; and I hope you'll be a dutiful
daughter and not encourage my son to further disobedience. I was
embarrassed how to punish him (<font color='blue'><b>son</b></font>) when I discovered his (<font color='blue'><b>son</b></font>) part in the business:
he (<font color='blue'><b>son</b></font>)'s such a cobweb, a pinch would annihilate him (<font color='blue'><b>son</b></font>); but you'll see by his (<font color='blue'><b>son</b></font>)
look that he (<font color='blue'><b>son</b></font>) has received his (<font color='blue'><b>son</b></font>) due! I brought him (<font color='blue'><b>son</b></font>) down one evening, the
day before yesterday, and just set him (<font color='blue'><b>son</b></font>) in a chair, and never touched him (<font color='blue'><b>son</b></font>)
afterwards. I sent Hareton out, and we had the room to ourselves. In
two hours, I called Joseph to carry him (<font color='blue'><b>Joseph</b></font>) up again; and since then my
presence is as potent on his (<font color='blue'><b>Joseph</b></font>) nerves as a ghost; and I fancy he (<font color='blue'><b>Joseph</b></font>) sees me
often, though I am not near. Hareton says he (<font color='blue'><b>Hareton</b></font>) wakes and shrieks in the
night by the hour together, and calls you to protect him (<font color='blue'><b>Hareton</b></font>) from me; and,
whether you like your precious mate, or not, you must come: he (<font color='blue'><b>mate</b></font>)'s your
concern now; I yield all my interest in him (<font color='blue'><b>mate</b></font>) to you.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Why not let Catherine continue here,''  (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div>I pleaded, `and send Master Linton
to her (<font color='blue'><b>Catherine</b></font>)? As you hate them both, you'd not miss them: they can only be a
daily plague to your unnatural heart.''

<p/><div class="bookquote">``I'm seeking a tenant for the Grange,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Linton</b></font>) answered; `and I want my
children about me, to be sure. Besides, that lass owes me her (<font color='blue'><b>lass</b></font>) services
for her (<font color='blue'><b>lass</b></font>) bread. I'm not going to nurture her (<font color='blue'><b>lass</b></font>) in luxury and idleness after
Linton is gone. Make haste and get ready, now; and don't oblige me to
compel you.''

<p/><div class="bookquote">``I shall,''  (<font color='red'><b>Catherine/Earnshaw/Catherine Earnshaw</b></font>)</div>said Catherine. <div class="bookquote">``Linton is all I have to love in the world,
and though you have done what you could to make him (<font color='blue'><b>mate</b></font>) hateful to me, and me
to him (<font color='blue'><b>mate</b></font>), you cannot make us hate each other. And I defy you to hurt him (<font color='blue'><b>mate</b></font>)
when I am by, and I defy you to frighten me!''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``You are a boastful champion,''  (<font color='red'><b>Heathcliff/Mr. Heathcliff</b></font>)</div>replied Heathcliff; `but I don't like you
well enough to hurt him (<font color='blue'><b>Heathcliff</b></font>): you shall get the full benefit of the torment,
as long as it lasts. It is not I who will make him (<font color='blue'><b>Heathcliff</b></font>) hateful to you--it is
his (<font color='blue'><b>Heathcliff</b></font>) own sweet spirit. He (<font color='blue'><b>Heathcliff</b></font>)'s as bitter as gall at your desertion and its
consequences: don't expect thanks for this noble devotion. I heard him (<font color='blue'><b>Heathcliff</b></font>)
draw a pleasant picture to Zillah of what he (<font color='blue'><b>Heathcliff</b></font>) would do if he (<font color='blue'><b>Heathcliff</b></font>) were as
strong as I: the inclination is there, and his (<font color='blue'><b>Heathcliff</b></font>) very weakness will sharpen
his (<font color='blue'><b>Heathcliff</b></font>) wits to find a substitute for strength.''

<p/><div class="bookquote">``I know he (<font color='blue'><b>champion</b></font>) has a bad nature,''  (<font color='red'><b>Catherine/Earnshaw/Catherine Earnshaw</b></font>)</div>said Catherine: `he (<font color='blue'><b>Heathcliff</b></font>)'s your son. But I'm
glad I've a better, to forgive it; and I know he (<font color='blue'><b>Heathcliff</b></font>) loves me, and for that
reason I love him (<font color='blue'><b>Heathcliff</b></font>). Mr. Heathcliff _you_ have _nobody_ to love you; and,
however miserable you make us, we shall still have the revenge of
thinking that your cruelty arises from your greater misery. You _are_
miserable, are you not? Lonely, like the devil, and envious like him (<font color='blue'><b>devil</b></font>)?
_Nobody_ loves you--_nobody_ will cry for you when you die! I wouldn't
be you!''

<p/>Catherine spoke with a kind of dreary triumph: she (<font color='blue'><b>Catherine</b></font>) seemed to have made up
her (<font color='blue'><b>Catherine</b></font>) mind to enter into the spirit of her (<font color='blue'><b>Catherine</b></font>) future family, and draw pleasure
from the griefs of her (<font color='blue'><b>Catherine</b></font>) enemies.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``You shall be sorry to be yourself presently,''  (<font color='red'><b>father-in-law</b></font>)</div>said her (<font color='blue'><b>Catherine</b></font>) father-in-law,
`if you stand there another minute. Begone, witch, and get your things!''

<p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>Catherine</b></font>) scornfully withdrew. In her (<font color='blue'><b>Catherine</b></font>) absence I began to beg for Zillah's
place at the Heights, offering to resign mine to her (<font color='blue'><b>Catherine</b></font>); but he (<font color='blue'><b>father-in-law</b></font>) would suffer
it on no account. He (<font color='blue'><b>father-in-law</b></font>) bid me be silent; and then, for the first time,
allowed himself a glance round the room and a look at the pictures.
Having studied Mrs. Linton's, he (<font color='blue'><b>father-in-law</b></font>) said--``I shall have that home. Not
because I need it, but--' He (<font color='blue'><b>champion</b></font>) turned abruptly to the fire, and continued,
with what, for lack of a better word, I must call a smile--<div class="bookquote">``I'll tell you
what I did yesterday! I got the sexton, who was digging Linton's grave,
to remove the earth off her (<font color='blue'><b>Linton</b></font>) coffin lid, and I opened it. I thought,
once, I would have stayed there: when I saw her (<font color='blue'><b>Linton</b></font>) face again--it is hers
yet!--he (<font color='blue'><b>sexton</b></font>) had hard work to stir me; but he (<font color='blue'><b>sexton</b></font>) said it would change if the air
blew on it, and so I struck one side of the coffin loose, and covered it
up: not Linton's side, damn him (<font color='blue'><b>sexton</b></font>)! I wish he (<font color='blue'><b>sexton</b></font>)'d been soldered in lead. And
I bribed the sexton to pull it away when I'm laid there, and slide mine
out too; I'll have it made so: and then by the time Linton gets to us
he (<font color='blue'><b>sexton</b></font>)'ll not know which is which!''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``You were very wicked, Mr. Heathcliff!''  (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div>I exclaimed; `were you not
ashamed to disturb the dead?''

<p/><div class="bookquote">``I disturbed nobody, Nelly,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>father-in-law</b></font>) replied; `and I gave some ease to myself.
I shall be a great deal more comfortable now; and you'll have a better
chance of keeping me underground, when I get there. Disturbed her (<font color='blue'><b>Linton</b></font>)? No!
she (<font color='blue'><b>Linton</b></font>) has disturbed me, night and day, through eighteen
years--incessantly--remorselessly--till yesternight; and yesternight I
was tranquil. I dreamt I was sleeping the last sleep by that sleeper,
with my heart stopped and my cheek frozen against hers.''

<p/><div class="bookquote">``And if she (<font color='blue'><b>Linton</b></font>) had been dissolved into earth, or worse, what would you have
dreamt of then?''  (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div>I said.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Of dissolving with her (<font color='blue'><b>Linton</b></font>), and being more happy still!''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>father-in-law</b></font>) answered. ``Do
you suppose I dread any change of that sort? I expected such a
transformation on raising the lid--but I'm better pleased that it should
not commence till I share it. Besides, unless I had received a distinct
impression of her (<font color='blue'><b>Linton</b></font>) passionless features, that strange feeling would hardly
have been removed. It began oddly. You know I was wild after she (<font color='blue'><b>Linton</b></font>) died;
and eternally, from dawn to dawn, praying her (<font color='blue'><b>Linton</b></font>) to return to me her (<font color='blue'><b>Linton</b></font>) spirit!
I have a strong faith in ghosts: I have a conviction that they can, and
do, exist among us! The day she (<font color='blue'><b>Linton</b></font>) was buried, there came a fall of snow.
In the evening I went to the churchyard. It blew bleak as winter--all
round was solitary. I didn't fear that her (<font color='blue'><b>Linton</b></font>) fool of a husband would
wander up the glen so late; and no one else had business to bring them
there. Being alone, and conscious two yards of loose earth was the sole
barrier between us, I said to myself--``I'll have her (<font color='blue'><b>Linton</b></font>) in my arms again! If
she (<font color='blue'><b>Linton</b></font>) be cold, I'll think it is this north wind that chills _me_; and if
she (<font color='blue'><b>Linton</b></font>) be motionless, it is sleep.'' I got a spade from the tool-house, and
began to delve with all my might--it scraped the coffin; I fell to work
with my hands; the wood commenced cracking about the screws; I was on the
point of attaining my object, when it seemed that I heard a sigh from
some one above, close at the edge of the grave, and bending down. ``If I
can only get this off,'' I muttered, ``I wish they may shovel in the earth
over us both!<div class="bookquote">'' and I wrenched at it more desperately still. There was
another sigh, close at my ear. I appeared to feel the warm breath of it
displacing the sleet-laden wind. I knew no living thing in flesh and
blood was by; but, as certainly as you perceive the approach to some
substantial body in the dark, though it cannot be discerned, so certainly
I felt that Cathy was there: not under me, but on the earth. A sudden
sense of relief flowed from my heart through every limb. I relinquished
my labour of agony, and turned consoled at once: unspeakably consoled.
Her (<font color='blue'><b>Cathy</b></font>) presence was with me: it remained while I re-filled the grave, and
led me home. You may laugh, if you will; but I was sure I should see her (<font color='blue'><b>Cathy</b></font>)
there. I was sure she (<font color='blue'><b>Cathy</b></font>) was with me, and I could not help talking to her (<font color='blue'><b>Cathy</b></font>).
Having reached the Heights, I rushed eagerly to the door. It was
fastened; and, I remember, that accursed Earnshaw and my wife opposed my
entrance. I remember stopping to kick the breath out of him (<font color='blue'><b>Cathy</b></font>), and then
hurrying up-stairs, to my room and hers. I looked round impatiently--I
felt her (<font color='blue'><b>Earnshaw</b></font>) by me--I could _almost_ see her (<font color='blue'><b>Earnshaw</b></font>), and yet I _could not_! I ought
to have sweat blood then, from the anguish of my yearning--from the
fervour of my supplications to have but one glimpse! I had not one. She (<font color='blue'><b>Earnshaw</b></font>)
showed herself, as she (<font color='blue'><b>Earnshaw</b></font>) often was in life, a devil to me! And, since
then, sometimes more and sometimes less, I've been the sport of that
intolerable torture! Infernal! keeping my nerves at such a stretch that,
if they had not resembled catgut, they would long ago have relaxed to the
feebleness of Linton's. When I sat in the house with Hareton, it seemed
that on going out I should meet her (<font color='blue'><b>Linton</b></font>); when I walked on the moors I should
meet her (<font color='blue'><b>Linton</b></font>) coming in. When I went from home I hastened to return; she (<font color='blue'><b>Linton</b></font>)
_must_ be somewhere at the Heights, I was certain! And when I slept in
her (<font color='blue'><b>Linton</b></font>) chamber--I was beaten out of that. I couldn't lie there; for the
moment I closed my eyes, she (<font color='blue'><b>Linton</b></font>) was either outside the window, or sliding
back the panels, or entering the room, or even resting her (<font color='blue'><b>Linton</b></font>) darling head
on the same pillow as she (<font color='blue'><b>Linton</b></font>) did when a child; and I must open my lids to
see. And so I opened and closed them a hundred times a night--to be
always disappointed! It racked me! I've often groaned aloud, till that
old rascal Joseph no doubt believed that my conscience was playing the
fiend inside of me. Now, since I've seen her (<font color='blue'><b>Linton</b></font>), I'm pacified--a little. It
was a strange way of killing: not by inches, but by fractions of
hairbreadths, to beguile me with the spectre of a hope through eighteen
years!''

 (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div><p/>Mr. Heathcliff paused and wiped his (<font color='blue'><b>Heathcliff</b></font>) forehead; his (<font color='blue'><b>Heathcliff</b></font>) hair clung to it, wet
with perspiration; his (<font color='blue'><b>Heathcliff</b></font>) eyes were fixed on the red embers of the fire, the
brows not contracted, but raised next the temples; diminishing the grim
aspect of his (<font color='blue'><b>Heathcliff</b></font>) countenance, but imparting a peculiar look of trouble, and
a painful appearance of mental tension towards one absorbing subject. He (<font color='blue'><b>Heathcliff</b></font>)
only half addressed me, and I maintained silence. I didn't like to hear
him (<font color='blue'><b>Heathcliff</b></font>) talk! After a short period he (<font color='blue'><b>Heathcliff</b></font>) resumed his (<font color='blue'><b>Heathcliff</b></font>) meditation on the picture,
took it down and leant it against the sofa to contemplate it at better
advantage; and while so occupied Catherine entered, announcing that she (<font color='blue'><b>Catherine</b></font>)
was ready, when her (<font color='blue'><b>Catherine</b></font>) pony should be saddled.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Send that over to-morrow,''  (<font color='red'><b>Heathcliff/Mr. Heathcliff</b></font>)</div>said Heathcliff to me; then turning to her (<font color='blue'><b>Catherine</b></font>),
he (<font color='blue'><b>Heathcliff</b></font>) added: <div class="bookquote">``You may do without your pony: it is a fine evening, and you'll
need no ponies at Wuthering Heights; for what journeys you take, your own
feet will serve you. Come along.''

 (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Good-bye, Ellen!''  (<font color='red'><b>mistress</b></font>)</div>whispered my dear little mistress.

<p/>As she (<font color='blue'><b>mistress</b></font>) kissed me, her (<font color='blue'><b>mistress</b></font>) lips felt like ice. <div class="bookquote">``Come and see me, Ellen; don't
forget.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Take care you do no such thing, Mrs. Dean!''  (<font color='red'><b>father</b></font>)</div>said her (<font color='blue'><b>mistress</b></font>) new father. <div class="bookquote">``When
I wish to speak to you I'll come here. I want none of your prying at my
house!''

 (<font color='red'><b>He</b></font>)</div><p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) signed her (<font color='blue'><b>mistress</b></font>) to precede him (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>); and casting back a look that cut my heart,
she (<font color='blue'><b>mistress</b></font>) obeyed. I watched them, from the window, walk down the garden.
Heathcliff fixed Catherine's arm under his (<font color='blue'><b>Heathcliff</b></font>): though she (<font color='blue'><b>Catherine</b></font>) disputed the act
at first evidently; and with rapid strides he (<font color='blue'><b>Heathcliff</b></font>) hurried her (<font color='blue'><b>Catherine</b></font>) into the alley,
whose trees concealed them.




<p/>CHAPTER XXX


<p/>I have paid a visit to the Heights, but I have not seen her (<font color='blue'><b>Catherine</b></font>) since she (<font color='blue'><b>Catherine</b></font>)
left: Joseph held the door in his (<font color='blue'><b>Joseph</b></font>) hand when I called to ask after her (<font color='blue'><b>Catherine</b></font>),
and wouldn't let me pass. He (<font color='blue'><b>Joseph</b></font>) said Mrs. Linton was <div class="bookquote">``thrang,''  (<font color='red'><b>Linton/Mrs. Linton/Mrs. Heathcliff</b></font>)</div>and the
master was not in. Zillah has told me something of the way they go on,
otherwise I should hardly know who was dead and who living. She (<font color='blue'><b>Linton</b></font>) thinks
Catherine haughty, and does not like her (<font color='blue'><b>Linton</b></font>), I can guess by her (<font color='blue'><b>Linton</b></font>) talk. My
young lady asked some aid of her (<font color='blue'><b>Linton</b></font>) when she (<font color='blue'><b>Linton</b></font>) first came; but Mr. Heathcliff
told her (<font color='blue'><b>Linton</b></font>) to follow her (<font color='blue'><b>Linton</b></font>) own business, and let his (<font color='blue'><b>Heathcliff</b></font>) daughter-in-law look
after herself; and Zillah willingly acquiesced, being a narrow-minded,
selfish woman. Catherine evinced a child's annoyance at this neglect;
repaid it with contempt, and thus enlisted my informant among her (<font color='blue'><b>Catherine</b></font>)
enemies, as securely as if she (<font color='blue'><b>Catherine</b></font>) had done her (<font color='blue'><b>Catherine</b></font>) some great wrong. I had a
long talk with Zillah about six weeks ago, a little before you came, one
day when we foregathered on the moor; and this is what she (<font color='blue'><b>Catherine</b></font>) told me.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``The first thing Mrs. Linton did,''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Catherine</b></font>) said, `on her (<font color='blue'><b>Catherine</b></font>) arrival at the
Heights, was to run up-stairs, without even wishing good-evening to me
and Joseph; she (<font color='blue'><b>Catherine</b></font>) shut herself into Linton's room, and remained till
morning. Then, while the master and Earnshaw were at breakfast, she (<font color='blue'><b>Earnshaw</b></font>)
entered the house, and asked all in a quiver if the doctor might be sent
for? her (<font color='blue'><b>Earnshaw</b></font>) cousin was very ill.

<p/>'<div class="bookquote">``We know that!''  (<font color='red'><b>Heathcliff/Mr. Heathcliff</b></font>)</div>answered Heathcliff; <div class="bookquote">``but his (<font color='blue'><b>you</b></font>) life is not worth a
farthing, and I won't spend a farthing on him (<font color='blue'><b>you</b></font>).''

 (<font color='red'><b>Heathcliff/Mr. Heathcliff</b></font>)</div><p/>'<div class="bookquote">``But I cannot tell how to do,''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Earnshaw</b></font>) said; <div class="bookquote">``and if nobody will help me,
he (<font color='blue'><b>you</b></font>)'ll die!''

 (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div><p/>'<div class="bookquote">``Walk out of the room,''  (<font color='red'><b>the master</b></font>)</div>cried the master, <div class="bookquote">``and let me never hear a word
more about him (<font color='blue'><b>you</b></font>)! None here care what becomes of him (<font color='blue'><b>you</b></font>); if you do, act the
nurse; if you do not, lock him (<font color='blue'><b>you</b></font>) up and leave him (<font color='blue'><b>you</b></font>).''

 (<font color='red'><b>the master</b></font>)</div><p/>``Then she (<font color='blue'><b>nurse</b></font>) began to bother me, and I said I'd had enough plague with the
tiresome thing; we each had our tasks, and hers was to wait on Linton:
Mr. Heathcliff bid me leave that labour to her (<font color='blue'><b>Linton</b></font>).

<p/>``How they managed together, I can't tell. I fancy he (<font color='blue'><b>Heathcliff</b></font>) fretted a great
deal, and moaned hisseln night and day; and she (<font color='blue'><b>Linton</b></font>) had precious little rest:
one could guess by her (<font color='blue'><b>Linton</b></font>) white face and heavy eyes. She (<font color='blue'><b>Linton</b></font>) sometimes came
into the kitchen all wildered like, and looked as if she (<font color='blue'><b>Linton</b></font>) would fain beg
assistance; but I was not going to disobey the master: I never dare
disobey him (<font color='blue'><b>master</b></font>), Mrs. Dean; and, though I thought it wrong that Kenneth
should not be sent for, it was no concern of mine either to advise or
complain, and I always refused to meddle. Once or twice, after we had
gone to bed, I've happened to open my door again and seen her (<font color='blue'><b>Dean</b></font>) sitting
crying on the stairs'-top; and then I've shut myself in quick, for fear
of being moved to interfere. I did pity her (<font color='blue'><b>Dean</b></font>) then, I'm sure: still I
didn't wish to lose my place, you know.

<p/>``At last, one night she (<font color='blue'><b>Dean</b></font>) came boldly into my chamber, and frightened me
out of my wits, by saying, <div class="bookquote">``Tell Mr. Heathcliff that his (<font color='blue'><b>Heathcliff</b></font>) son is dying--I'm
sure he (<font color='blue'><b>Heathcliff</b></font>) is, this time. Get up, instantly, and tell him (<font color='blue'><b>Heathcliff</b></font>).''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/>``Having uttered this speech, she (<font color='blue'><b>Dean</b></font>) vanished again. I lay a quarter of an
hour listening and trembling. Nothing stirred--the house was quiet.

<p/>``She (<font color='blue'><b>Dean</b></font>)'s mistaken, I said to myself. He (<font color='blue'><b>Heathcliff</b></font>)'s got over it. I needn't disturb
them; and I began to doze. But my sleep was marred a second time by a
sharp ringing of the bell--the only bell we have, put up on purpose for
Linton; and the master called to me to see what was the matter, and
inform them that he (<font color='blue'><b>master</b></font>) wouldn't have that noise repeated.

<p/>``I delivered Catherine's message. He (<font color='blue'><b>master</b></font>) cursed to himself, and in a few
minutes came out with a lighted candle, and proceeded to their room. I
followed. Mrs. Heathcliff was seated by the bedside, with her (<font color='blue'><b>Heathcliff</b></font>) hands
folded on her (<font color='blue'><b>Heathcliff</b></font>) knees. Her (<font color='blue'><b>Heathcliff</b></font>) father-in-law went up, held the light to
Linton's face, looked at him (<font color='blue'><b>father-in-law</b></font>), and touched him (<font color='blue'><b>father-in-law</b></font>); afterwards he (<font color='blue'><b>father-in-law</b></font>) turned to
her (<font color='blue'><b>Linton</b></font>).

<p/>'<div class="bookquote">``Now--Catherine,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>master</b></font>) said, <div class="bookquote">``how do you feel?''

 (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div><p/>``She (<font color='blue'><b>Catherine</b></font>) was dumb.

<p/>'<div class="bookquote">``How do you feel, Catherine?''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>master</b></font>) repeated.

<p/>'<div class="bookquote">``He (<font color='blue'><b>father-in-law</b></font>)'s safe, and I'm free,''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Earnshaw</b></font>) answered: <div class="bookquote">``I should feel well--but,''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Earnshaw</b></font>)
continued, with a bitterness she (<font color='blue'><b>Earnshaw</b></font>) couldn't conceal, <div class="bookquote">``you have left me so
long to struggle against death alone, that I feel and see only death! I
feel like death!''

 (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div><p/>``And she (<font color='blue'><b>Catherine</b></font>) looked like it, too! I gave her (<font color='blue'><b>Catherine</b></font>) a little wine. Hareton and
Joseph, who had been wakened by the ringing and the sound of feet, and
heard our talk from outside, now entered. Joseph was fain, I believe, of
the lad's removal; Hareton seemed a thought bothered: though he (<font color='blue'><b>Hareton</b></font>) was more
taken up with staring at Catherine than thinking of Linton. But the
master bid him (<font color='blue'><b>master</b></font>) get off to bed again: we didn't want his (<font color='blue'><b>master</b></font>) help. He (<font color='blue'><b>master</b></font>)
afterwards made Joseph remove the body to his (<font color='blue'><b>Joseph</b></font>) chamber, and told me to
return to mine, and Mrs. Heathcliff remained by herself.

<p/>``In the morning, he (<font color='blue'><b>Joseph</b></font>) sent me to tell her (<font color='blue'><b>Heathcliff</b></font>) she (<font color='blue'><b>Heathcliff</b></font>) must come down to breakfast:
she (<font color='blue'><b>Heathcliff</b></font>) had undressed, and appeared going to sleep, and said she (<font color='blue'><b>Heathcliff</b></font>) was ill; at
which I hardly wondered. I informed Mr. Heathcliff, and he (<font color='blue'><b>Heathcliff</b></font>)
replied,--<div class="bookquote">``Well, let her (<font color='blue'><b>Heathcliff</b></font>) be till after the funeral; and go up now and
then to get her (<font color='blue'><b>Heathcliff</b></font>) what is needful; and, as soon as she (<font color='blue'><b>Heathcliff</b></font>) seems better, tell
me.'' (<font color='red'><b>Cathy/Miss Cathy</b></font>)</div>'

<p/>Cathy stayed upstairs a fortnight, according to Zillah; who visited her (<font color='blue'><b>Cathy</b></font>)
twice a day, and would have been rather more friendly, but her (<font color='blue'><b>Cathy</b></font>) attempts
at increasing kindness were proudly and promptly repelled.

<p/>Heathcliff went up once, to show her (<font color='blue'><b>Cathy</b></font>) Linton's will. He (<font color='blue'><b>Heathcliff</b></font>) had bequeathed
the whole of his (<font color='blue'><b>Heathcliff</b></font>), and what had been her (<font color='blue'><b>Cathy</b></font>), moveable property, to his (<font color='blue'><b>Heathcliff</b></font>)
father: the poor creature was threatened, or coaxed, into that act during
her (<font color='blue'><b>Cathy</b></font>) week's absence, when his (<font color='blue'><b>Heathcliff</b></font>) uncle died. The lands, being a minor, he (<font color='blue'><b>Heathcliff</b></font>)
could not meddle with. However, Mr. Heathcliff has claimed and kept them
in his (<font color='blue'><b>Heathcliff</b></font>) wife's right and his (<font color='blue'><b>Heathcliff</b></font>) also: I suppose legally; at any rate,
Catherine, destitute of cash and friends, cannot disturb his (<font color='blue'><b>Heathcliff</b></font>) possession.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Nobody,''  (<font color='red'><b>Zillah</b></font>)</div>said Zillah, `ever approached her (<font color='blue'><b>Catherine</b></font>) door, except that once, but
I; and nobody asked anything about her (<font color='blue'><b>Catherine</b></font>). The first occasion of her (<font color='blue'><b>Catherine</b></font>) coming
down into the house was on a Sunday afternoon. She (<font color='blue'><b>Catherine</b></font>) had cried out, when I
carried up her (<font color='blue'><b>Catherine</b></font>) dinner, that she (<font color='blue'><b>Catherine</b></font>) couldn't bear any longer being in the
cold; and I told her (<font color='blue'><b>Catherine</b></font>) the master was going to Thrushcross Grange, and
Earnshaw and I needn't hinder her (<font color='blue'><b>Earnshaw</b></font>) from descending; so, as soon as she (<font color='blue'><b>Earnshaw</b></font>)
heard Heathcliff's horse trot off, she (<font color='blue'><b>Earnshaw</b></font>) made her (<font color='blue'><b>Earnshaw</b></font>) appearance, donned in
black, and her (<font color='blue'><b>Earnshaw</b></font>) yellow curls combed back behind her (<font color='blue'><b>Earnshaw</b></font>) ears as plain as a
Quaker: she (<font color='blue'><b>Earnshaw</b></font>) couldn't comb them out.

<p/>``Joseph and I generally go to chapel on Sundays:' the kirk, you know, has
no minister now, explained Mrs. Dean; and they call the Methodists' or
Baptists' place -LRB-I can't say which it is-RRB- at Gimmerton, a chapel. <div class="bookquote">``Joseph
had gone,''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Earnshaw</b></font>) continued, `but I thought proper to bide at home. Young
folks are always the better for an elder's over-looking; and Hareton,
with all his (<font color='blue'><b>Hareton</b></font>) bashfulness, isn't a model of nice behaviour. I let him (<font color='blue'><b>Hareton</b></font>)
know that his (<font color='blue'><b>Hareton</b></font>) cousin would very likely sit with us, and she (<font color='blue'><b>Earnshaw</b></font>) had been
always used to see the Sabbath respected; so he (<font color='blue'><b>Hareton</b></font>) had as good leave his (<font color='blue'><b>Hareton</b></font>)
guns and bits of indoor work alone, while she (<font color='blue'><b>Earnshaw</b></font>) stayed. He (<font color='blue'><b>Hareton</b></font>) coloured up at
the news, and cast his (<font color='blue'><b>Hareton</b></font>) eyes over his (<font color='blue'><b>Hareton</b></font>) hands and clothes. The train-oil
and gunpowder were shoved out of sight in a minute. I saw he (<font color='blue'><b>Hareton</b></font>) meant to
give her (<font color='blue'><b>Earnshaw</b></font>) his (<font color='blue'><b>Hareton</b></font>) company; and I guessed, by his (<font color='blue'><b>Hareton</b></font>) way, he (<font color='blue'><b>Hareton</b></font>) wanted to be
presentable; so, laughing, as I durst not laugh when the master is by, I
offered to help him (<font color='blue'><b>master</b></font>), if he (<font color='blue'><b>master</b></font>) would, and joked at his (<font color='blue'><b>master</b></font>) confusion. He (<font color='blue'><b>master</b></font>) grew
sullen, and began to swear.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Now, Mrs. Dean,''  (<font color='red'><b>Zillah</b></font>)</div>Zillah went on, seeing me not pleased by her (<font color='blue'><b>Earnshaw</b></font>) manner,
`you happen think your young lady too fine for Mr. Hareton; and happen
you're right: but I own I should love well to bring her (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) pride a peg
lower. And what will all her (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) learning and her (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) daintiness do for her (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>),
now? She (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>)'s as poor as you or I: poorer, I'll be bound: you're saying,
and I'm doing my little all that road.''

<p/>Hareton allowed Zillah to give him (<font color='blue'><b>Hareton</b></font>) her (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) aid; and she (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) flattered him (<font color='blue'><b>Hareton</b></font>) into a
good humour; so, when Catherine came, half forgetting her (<font color='blue'><b>Catherine</b></font>) former insults,
he (<font color='blue'><b>Hareton</b></font>) tried to make himself agreeable, by the housekeeper's account.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Missis walked in,''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Catherine</b></font>) said, `as chill as an icicle, and as high as a
princess. I got up and offered her (<font color='blue'><b>princess</b></font>) my seat in the arm-chair. No, she (<font color='blue'><b>princess</b></font>)
turned up her (<font color='blue'><b>princess</b></font>) nose at my civility. Earnshaw rose, too, and bid her (<font color='blue'><b>Earnshaw</b></font>) come
to the settle, and sit close by the fire: he (<font color='blue'><b>Hareton</b></font>) was sure she (<font color='blue'><b>Earnshaw</b></font>) was starved.

<p/>'<div class="bookquote">``I've been starved a month and more,''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Earnshaw</b></font>) answered, resting on the word
as scornful as she (<font color='blue'><b>Earnshaw</b></font>) could.

<p/>``And she (<font color='blue'><b>Dean</b></font>) got a chair for herself, and placed it at a distance from both
of us. Having sat till she (<font color='blue'><b>Dean</b></font>) was warm, she (<font color='blue'><b>Dean</b></font>) began to look round, and
discovered a number of books on the dresser; she (<font color='blue'><b>Dean</b></font>) was instantly upon her (<font color='blue'><b>Dean</b></font>)
feet again, stretching to reach them: but they were too high up. Her (<font color='blue'><b>Dean</b></font>)
cousin, after watching her (<font color='blue'><b>Dean</b></font>) endeavours a while, at last summoned courage
to help her (<font color='blue'><b>Dean</b></font>); she (<font color='blue'><b>Dean</b></font>) held her (<font color='blue'><b>Dean</b></font>) frock, and he (<font color='blue'><b>cousin</b></font>) filled it with the first that
came to hand.

<p/>``That was a great advance for the lad. She (<font color='blue'><b>Dean</b></font>) didn't thank him (<font color='blue'><b>lad</b></font>); still, he (<font color='blue'><b>lad</b></font>)
felt gratified that she (<font color='blue'><b>Dean</b></font>) had accepted his (<font color='blue'><b>lad</b></font>) assistance, and ventured to
stand behind as she (<font color='blue'><b>Dean</b></font>) examined them, and even to stoop and point out what
struck his (<font color='blue'><b>lad</b></font>) fancy in certain old pictures which they contained; nor was he (<font color='blue'><b>lad</b></font>)
daunted by the saucy style in which she (<font color='blue'><b>Dean</b></font>) jerked the page from his (<font color='blue'><b>lad</b></font>) finger:
he (<font color='blue'><b>lad</b></font>) contented himself with going a bit farther back and looking at her (<font color='blue'><b>Dean</b></font>)
instead of the book. She (<font color='blue'><b>Dean</b></font>) continued reading, or seeking for something to
read. His (<font color='blue'><b>lad</b></font>) attention became, by degrees, quite centred in the study of
her (<font color='blue'><b>Dean</b></font>) thick silky curls: her (<font color='blue'><b>Dean</b></font>) face he (<font color='blue'><b>lad</b></font>) couldn't see, and she (<font color='blue'><b>Dean</b></font>) couldn't see
him (<font color='blue'><b>lad</b></font>). And, perhaps, not quite awake to what he (<font color='blue'><b>lad</b></font>) did, but attracted like a
child to a candle, at last he (<font color='blue'><b>lad</b></font>) proceeded from staring to touching; he (<font color='blue'><b>lad</b></font>) put
out his (<font color='blue'><b>lad</b></font>) hand and stroked one curl, as gently as if it were a bird. He (<font color='blue'><b>lad</b></font>)
might have stuck a knife into her (<font color='blue'><b>Dean</b></font>) neck, she (<font color='blue'><b>Dean</b></font>) started round in such a
taking.

<p/>'<div class="bookquote">``Get away this moment! How dare you touch me? Why are you stopping
there?''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Earnshaw</b></font>) cried, in a tone of disgust. <div class="bookquote">``I can't endure you! I'll go
upstairs again, if you come near me.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/>``Mr. Hareton recoiled, looking as foolish as he (<font color='blue'><b>Hareton</b></font>) could do: he (<font color='blue'><b>Hareton</b></font>) sat down in
the settle very quiet, and she (<font color='blue'><b>Dean</b></font>) continued turning over her (<font color='blue'><b>Dean</b></font>) volumes another
half hour; finally, Earnshaw crossed over, and whispered to me.

<p/>'<div class="bookquote">``Will you ask her (<font color='blue'><b>Earnshaw</b></font>) to read to us, Zillah? I'm stalled of doing naught;
and I do like--I could like to hear her (<font color='blue'><b>Earnshaw</b></font>)! Dunnot say I wanted it, but ask
of yourseln.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/>'<div class="bookquote">``Mr. Hareton wishes you would read to us, ma'am,''  (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div>I said, immediately.
<div class="bookquote">``He (<font color='blue'><b>Hareton</b></font>)'d take it very kind--he (<font color='blue'><b>Hareton</b></font>)'d be much obliged.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/>``She (<font color='blue'><b>Earnshaw</b></font>) frowned; and looking up, answered--

<p/>'<div class="bookquote">``Mr. Hareton, and the whole set of you, will be good enough to
understand that I reject any pretence at kindness you have the hypocrisy
to offer! I despise you, and will have nothing to say to any of you!
When I would have given my life for one kind word, even to see one of
your faces, you all kept off. But I won't complain to you! I'm driven
down here by the cold; not either to amuse you or enjoy your society.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/>'<div class="bookquote">``What could I ha' done?''  (<font color='red'><b>Catherine/Earnshaw/Catherine Earnshaw</b></font>)</div>began Earnshaw. <div class="bookquote">``How was I to blame?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/>'<div class="bookquote">``Oh! you are an exception,''  (<font color='red'><b>Linton/Mrs. Linton/Mrs. Heathcliff</b></font>)</div>answered Mrs. Heathcliff. <div class="bookquote">``I never missed
such a concern as you.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/>'<div class="bookquote">``But I offered more than once, and asked,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Hareton</b></font>) said, kindling up at her (<font color='blue'><b>Heathcliff</b></font>)
pertness, <div class="bookquote">``I asked Mr. Heathcliff to let me wake for you--''

 (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div><p/>'<div class="bookquote">``Be silent! I'll go out of doors, or anywhere, rather than have your
disagreeable voice in my ear!''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>said my lady.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Hareton muttered she (<font color='blue'><b>your</b></font>) might go to hell, for him (<font color='blue'><b>Hareton</b></font>)! and unslinging his (<font color='blue'><b>Hareton</b></font>) gun,
restrained himself from his (<font color='blue'><b>Hareton</b></font>) Sunday occupations no longer. He (<font color='blue'><b>Hareton</b></font>) talked now,
freely enough; and she (<font color='blue'><b>your</b></font>) presently saw fit to retreat to her (<font color='blue'><b>your</b></font>) solitude: but
the frost had set in, and, in spite of her (<font color='blue'><b>your</b></font>) pride, she (<font color='blue'><b>your</b></font>) was forced to
condescend to our company, more and more. However, I took care there
should be no further scorning at my good nature: ever since, I've been as
stiff as herself; and she (<font color='blue'><b>your</b></font>) has no lover or liker among us: and she (<font color='blue'><b>your</b></font>) does
not deserve one; for, let them say the least word to her (<font color='blue'><b>your</b></font>), and she (<font color='blue'><b>your</b></font>)'ll curl
back without respect of any one. She (<font color='blue'><b>your</b></font>)'ll snap at the master himself, and
as good as dares him (<font color='blue'><b>master</b></font>) to thrash her (<font color='blue'><b>your</b></font>); and the more hurt she (<font color='blue'><b>your</b></font>) gets, the more
venomous she (<font color='blue'><b>your</b></font>) grows.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Zillah</b></font>)</div><p/>At first, on hearing this account from Zillah, I determined to leave my
situation, take a cottage, and get Catherine to come and live with me:
but Mr. Heathcliff would as soon permit that as he (<font color='blue'><b>Heathcliff</b></font>) would set up Hareton
in an independent house; and I can see no remedy, at present, unless she (<font color='blue'><b>Catherine</b></font>)
could marry again; and that scheme it does not come within my province to
arrange.

<p/>* * * * *

<p/>Thus ended Mrs. Dean's story. Notwithstanding the doctor's prophecy, I
am rapidly recovering strength; and though it be only the second week in
January, I propose getting out on horseback in a day or two, and riding
over to Wuthering Heights, to inform my landlord that I shall spend the
next six months in London; and, if he (<font color='blue'><b>doctor</b></font>) likes, he (<font color='blue'><b>doctor</b></font>) may look out for another
tenant to take the place after October. I would not pass another winter
here for much.




<p/>CHAPTER XXXI


<p/>Yesterday was bright, calm, and frosty. I went to the Heights as I
proposed: my housekeeper entreated me to bear a little note from her (<font color='blue'><b>housekeeper</b></font>) to
her (<font color='blue'><b>housekeeper</b></font>) young lady, and I did not refuse, for the worthy woman was not
conscious of anything odd in her (<font color='blue'><b>housekeeper</b></font>) request. The front door stood open, but
the jealous gate was fastened, as at my last visit; I knocked and invoked
Earnshaw from among the garden-beds; he (<font color='blue'><b>housekeeper</b></font>) unchained it, and I entered. The
fellow is as handsome a rustic as need be seen. I took particular notice
of him (<font color='blue'><b>fellow</b></font>) this time; but then he (<font color='blue'><b>fellow</b></font>) does his (<font color='blue'><b>fellow</b></font>) best apparently to make the least
of his (<font color='blue'><b>fellow</b></font>) advantages.

<p/>I asked if Mr. Heathcliff were at home? He (<font color='blue'><b>Heathcliff</b></font>) answered, No; but he (<font color='blue'><b>Heathcliff</b></font>) would be
in at dinner-time. It was eleven o'clock, and I announced my intention
of going in and waiting for him (<font color='blue'><b>Heathcliff</b></font>); at which he (<font color='blue'><b>Heathcliff</b></font>) immediately flung down his (<font color='blue'><b>Heathcliff</b></font>)
tools and accompanied me, in the office of watchdog, not as a substitute
for the host.

<p/>We entered together; Catherine was there, making herself useful in
preparing some vegetables for the approaching meal; she (<font color='blue'><b>Catherine</b></font>) looked more
sulky and less spirited than when I had seen her (<font color='blue'><b>Catherine</b></font>) first. She (<font color='blue'><b>Catherine</b></font>) hardly
raised her (<font color='blue'><b>Catherine</b></font>) eyes to notice me, and continued her (<font color='blue'><b>Catherine</b></font>) employment with the same
disregard to common forms of politeness as before; never returning my
bow and good-morning by the slightest acknowledgment.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``She (<font color='blue'><b>your</b></font>) does not seem so amiable,''  (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div>I thought, `as Mrs. Dean would persuade
me to believe. She (<font color='blue'><b>Dean</b></font>)'s a beauty, it is true; but not an angel.''

<p/>Earnshaw surlily bid her (<font color='blue'><b>Earnshaw</b></font>) remove her (<font color='blue'><b>Earnshaw</b></font>) things to the kitchen. <div class="bookquote">``Remove them
yourself,''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Earnshaw</b></font>) said, pushing them from her (<font color='blue'><b>Earnshaw</b></font>) as soon as she (<font color='blue'><b>Earnshaw</b></font>) had done; and
retiring to a stool by the window, where she (<font color='blue'><b>Earnshaw</b></font>) began to carve figures of
birds and beasts out of the turnip-parings in her (<font color='blue'><b>Earnshaw</b></font>) lap. I approached her (<font color='blue'><b>Earnshaw</b></font>),
pretending to desire a view of the garden; and, as I fancied, adroitly
dropped Mrs. Dean's note on to her (<font color='blue'><b>Dean</b></font>) knee, unnoticed by Hareton--but she (<font color='blue'><b>Dean</b></font>)
asked aloud, <div class="bookquote">``What is that?''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>And chucked it off.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``A letter from your old acquaintance, the housekeeper at the Grange,''  (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div>I
answered; annoyed at her (<font color='blue'><b>Dean</b></font>) exposing my kind deed, and fearful lest it
should be imagined a missive of my own. She (<font color='blue'><b>Dean</b></font>) would gladly have gathered
it up at this information, but Hareton beat her (<font color='blue'><b>Dean</b></font>); he (<font color='blue'><b>Hareton</b></font>) seized and put it in
his (<font color='blue'><b>Hareton</b></font>) waistcoat, saying Mr. Heathcliff should look at it first. Thereat,
Catherine silently turned her (<font color='blue'><b>Catherine</b></font>) face from us, and, very stealthily, drew
out her (<font color='blue'><b>Catherine</b></font>) pocket-handkerchief and applied it to her (<font color='blue'><b>Catherine</b></font>) eyes; and her (<font color='blue'><b>Catherine</b></font>) cousin,
after struggling awhile to keep down his (<font color='blue'><b>cousin</b></font>) softer feelings, pulled out the
letter and flung it on the floor beside her (<font color='blue'><b>Catherine</b></font>), as ungraciously as he (<font color='blue'><b>cousin</b></font>) could.
Catherine caught and perused it eagerly; then she (<font color='blue'><b>Catherine</b></font>) put a few questions to
me concerning the inmates, rational and irrational, of her (<font color='blue'><b>Catherine</b></font>) former home;
and gazing towards the hills, murmured in soliloquy:

<p/><div class="bookquote">``I should like to be riding Minny down there! I should like to be
climbing up there! Oh! I'm tired--I'm _stalled_, Hareton!''  (<font color='red'><b>the inmates</b></font>)</div>And she (<font color='blue'><b>Catherine</b></font>)
leant her (<font color='blue'><b>Catherine</b></font>) pretty head back against the sill, with half a yawn and half a
sigh, and lapsed into an aspect of abstracted sadness: neither caring nor
knowing whether we remarked her (<font color='blue'><b>Catherine</b></font>).

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Mrs. Heathcliff,''  (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div>I said, after sitting some time mute, `you are not
aware that I am an acquaintance of yours? so intimate that I think it
strange you won't come and speak to me. My housekeeper never wearies of
talking about and praising you; and she (<font color='blue'><b>housekeeper</b></font>)'ll be greatly disappointed if I
return with no news of or from you, except that you received her (<font color='blue'><b>housekeeper</b></font>) letter
and said nothing!''

<p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>housekeeper</b></font>) appeared to wonder at this speech, and asked,--

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Does Ellen like you?''

 (<font color='red'><b>She</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Yes, very well,''  (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div>I replied, hesitatingly.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``You must tell her (<font color='blue'><b>Heathcliff</b></font>),''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>housekeeper</b></font>) continued, `that I would answer her (<font color='blue'><b>housekeeper</b></font>) letter, but
I have no materials for writing: not even a book from which I might tear
a leaf.''

<p/><div class="bookquote">``No books!''  (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div>I exclaimed. <div class="bookquote">``How do you contrive to live here without them?
if I may take the liberty to inquire. Though provided with a large
library, I'm frequently very dull at the Grange; take my books away, and
I should be desperate!''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I was always reading, when I had them,''  (<font color='red'><b>Catherine/Earnshaw/Catherine Earnshaw</b></font>)</div>said Catherine; `and Mr.
Heathcliff never reads; so he (<font color='blue'><b>Heathcliff</b></font>) took it into his (<font color='blue'><b>Heathcliff</b></font>) head to destroy my books.
I have not had a glimpse of one for weeks. Only once, I searched through
Joseph's store of theology, to his (<font color='blue'><b>Joseph</b></font>) great irritation; and once, Hareton, I
came upon a secret stock in your room--some Latin and Greek, and some
tales and poetry: all old friends. I brought the last here--and you
gathered them, as a magpie gathers silver spoons, for the mere love of
stealing! They are of no use to you; or else you concealed them in the
bad spirit that, as you cannot enjoy them, nobody else shall. Perhaps
_your_ envy counselled Mr. Heathcliff to rob me of my treasures? But
I've most of them written on my brain and printed in my heart, and you
cannot deprive me of those!''

<p/>Earnshaw blushed crimson when his (<font color='blue'><b>Heathcliff</b></font>) cousin made this revelation of his (<font color='blue'><b>Heathcliff</b></font>)
private literary accumulations, and stammered an indignant denial of her (<font color='blue'><b>Earnshaw</b></font>)
accusations.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Mr. Hareton is desirous of increasing his (<font color='blue'><b>Hareton</b></font>) amount of knowledge,''  (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div>I said,
coming to his (<font color='blue'><b>Heathcliff</b></font>) rescue. <div class="bookquote">``He (<font color='blue'><b>Hareton</b></font>) is not _envious_, but _emulous_ of your
attainments. He (<font color='blue'><b>Hareton</b></font>)'ll be a clever scholar in a few years.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``And he (<font color='blue'><b>Hareton</b></font>) wants me to sink into a dunce, meantime,''  (<font color='red'><b>Catherine/Earnshaw/Catherine Earnshaw</b></font>)</div>answered Catherine.
<div class="bookquote">``Yes, I hear him (<font color='blue'><b>Hareton</b></font>) trying to spell and read to himself, and pretty blunders
he (<font color='blue'><b>Hareton</b></font>) makes! I wish you would repeat Chevy Chase as you did yesterday: it
was extremely funny. I heard you; and I heard you turning over the
dictionary to seek out the hard words, and then cursing because you
couldn't read their explanations!''

 (<font color='red'><b>The man</b></font>)</div><p/>The young man evidently thought it too bad that he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) should be laughed at
for his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) ignorance, and then laughed at for trying to remove it. I had a
similar notion; and, remembering Mrs. Dean's anecdote of his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) first
attempt at enlightening the darkness in which he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) had been reared, I
observed,--<div class="bookquote">``But, Mrs. Heathcliff, we have each had a commencement, and
each stumbled and tottered on the threshold; had our teachers scorned
instead of aiding us, we should stumble and totter yet.''

 (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Oh!''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Dean</b></font>) replied, <div class="bookquote">``I don't wish to limit his (<font color='blue'><b>Chase</b></font>) acquirements: still, he (<font color='blue'><b>Chase</b></font>) has
no right to appropriate what is mine, and make it ridiculous to me with
his (<font color='blue'><b>Chase</b></font>) vile mistakes and mispronunciations! Those books, both prose and
verse, are consecrated to me by other associations; and I hate to have
them debased and profaned in his (<font color='blue'><b>Chase</b></font>) mouth! Besides, of all, he (<font color='blue'><b>Chase</b></font>) has selected
my favourite pieces that I love the most to repeat, as if out of
deliberate malice.''

 (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div><p/>Hareton's chest heaved in silence a minute: he (<font color='blue'><b>Hareton</b></font>) laboured under a severe
sense of mortification and wrath, which it was no easy task to suppress.
I rose, and, from a gentlemanly idea of relieving his (<font color='blue'><b>Hareton</b></font>) embarrassment, took
up my station in the doorway, surveying the external prospect as I stood.
He (<font color='blue'><b>Hareton</b></font>) followed my example, and left the room; but presently reappeared,
bearing half a dozen volumes in his (<font color='blue'><b>Hareton</b></font>) hands, which he (<font color='blue'><b>Hareton</b></font>) threw into
Catherine's lap, exclaiming,--<div class="bookquote">``Take them! I never want to hear, or read,
or think of them again!''

 (<font color='red'><b>Catherine/Earnshaw/Catherine Earnshaw</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I won't have them now,''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Catherine</b></font>) answered. <div class="bookquote">``I shall connect them with you,
and hate them.''

 (<font color='red'><b>She</b></font>)</div><p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>Catherine</b></font>) opened one that had obviously been often turned over, and read a
portion in the drawling tone of a beginner; then laughed, and threw it
from her (<font color='blue'><b>Catherine</b></font>). <div class="bookquote">``And listen,''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Catherine</b></font>) continued, provokingly, commencing a verse
of an old ballad in the same fashion.

<p/>But his (<font color='blue'><b>Hareton</b></font>) self-love would endure no further torment: I heard, and not
altogether disapprovingly, a manual check given to her (<font color='blue'><b>Catherine</b></font>) saucy tongue. The
little wretch had done her (<font color='blue'><b>Catherine</b></font>) utmost to hurt her (<font color='blue'><b>Catherine</b></font>) cousin's sensitive though
uncultivated feelings, and a physical argument was the only mode he (<font color='blue'><b>cousin</b></font>) had
of balancing the account, and repaying its effects on the inflictor. He (<font color='blue'><b>cousin</b></font>)
afterwards gathered the books and hurled them on the fire. I read in his (<font color='blue'><b>cousin</b></font>)
countenance what anguish it was to offer that sacrifice to spleen. I
fancied that as they consumed, he (<font color='blue'><b>cousin</b></font>) recalled the pleasure they had already
imparted, and the triumph and ever-increasing pleasure he (<font color='blue'><b>cousin</b></font>) had anticipated
from them; and I fancied I guessed the incitement to his (<font color='blue'><b>cousin</b></font>) secret studies
also. He (<font color='blue'><b>cousin</b></font>) had been content with daily labour and rough animal enjoyments,
till Catherine crossed his (<font color='blue'><b>cousin</b></font>) path. Shame at her (<font color='blue'><b>Catherine</b></font>) scorn, and hope of her (<font color='blue'><b>Catherine</b></font>)
approval, were his (<font color='blue'><b>cousin</b></font>) first prompters to higher pursuits; and instead of
guarding him (<font color='blue'><b>cousin</b></font>) from one and winning him (<font color='blue'><b>cousin</b></font>) to the other, his (<font color='blue'><b>cousin</b></font>) endeavours to
raise himself had produced just the contrary result.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Yes that's all the good that such a brute as you can get from them!''
 (<font color='red'><b>Catherine/Earnshaw/Catherine Earnshaw</b></font>)</div>cried Catherine, sucking her (<font color='blue'><b>Catherine</b></font>) damaged lip, and watching the conflagration
with indignant eyes.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``You'd _better_ hold your tongue, now,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>lip</b></font>) answered fiercely.

<p/>And his (<font color='blue'><b>lip</b></font>) agitation precluded further speech; he (<font color='blue'><b>lip</b></font>) advanced hastily to the
entrance, where I made way for him (<font color='blue'><b>lip</b></font>) to pass. But ere he (<font color='blue'><b>lip</b></font>) had crossed the
door-stones, Mr. Heathcliff, coming up the causeway, encountered him (<font color='blue'><b>Heathcliff</b></font>), and
laying hold of his (<font color='blue'><b>Heathcliff</b></font>) shoulder asked,--<div class="bookquote">``What's to do now, my lad?''

 (<font color='red'><b>him</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Naught, naught,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Heathcliff</b></font>) said, and broke away to enjoy his (<font color='blue'><b>Heathcliff</b></font>) grief and anger in
solitude.

<p/>Heathcliff gazed after him (<font color='blue'><b>Heathcliff</b></font>), and sighed.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``It will be odd if I thwart myself,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Heathcliff</b></font>) muttered, unconscious that I was
behind him (<font color='blue'><b>Heathcliff</b></font>). <div class="bookquote">``But when I look for his (<font color='blue'><b>lad</b></font>) father in his (<font color='blue'><b>lad</b></font>) face, I find _her (<font color='blue'><b>I</b></font>)_
every day more! How the devil is he (<font color='blue'><b>devil</b></font>) so like? I can hardly bear to see
him (<font color='blue'><b>devil</b></font>).''

 (<font color='red'><b>He</b></font>)</div><p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Heathcliff</b></font>) bent his (<font color='blue'><b>Heathcliff</b></font>) eyes to the ground, and walked moodily in. There was a
restless, anxious expression in his (<font color='blue'><b>Heathcliff</b></font>) countenance. I had never remarked
there before; and he (<font color='blue'><b>Heathcliff</b></font>) looked sparer in person. His (<font color='blue'><b>Heathcliff</b></font>) daughter-in-law, on
perceiving him (<font color='blue'><b>Heathcliff</b></font>) through the window, immediately escaped to the kitchen, so
that I remained alone.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``I'm glad to see you out of doors again, Mr. Lockwood,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Heathcliff</b></font>) said, in reply
to my greeting; `from selfish motives partly: I don't think I could
readily supply your loss in this desolation. I've wondered more than
once what brought you here.''

<p/><div class="bookquote">``An idle whim, I fear, sir,''  (<font color='red'><b>me</b></font>)</div>was my answer; `or else an idle whim is
going to spirit me away. I shall set out for London next week; and I
must give you warning that I feel no disposition to retain Thrushcross
Grange beyond the twelve months I agreed to rent it. I believe I shall
not live there any more.''

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Oh, indeed; you're tired of being banished from the world, are you?''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>I</b></font>)
said. <div class="bookquote">``But if you be coming to plead off paying for a place you won't
occupy, your journey is useless: I never relent in exacting my due from
any one.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I'm coming to plead off nothing about it,''  (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div>I exclaimed, considerably
irritated. <div class="bookquote">``Should you wish it, I'll settle with you now,''  (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div>and I drew my
note-book from my pocket.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``No, no,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>I</b></font>) replied, coolly; `you'll leave sufficient behind to cover
your debts, if you fail to return: I'm not in such a hurry. Sit down and
take your dinner with us; a guest that is safe from repeating his (<font color='blue'><b>guest</b></font>) visit
can generally be made welcome. Catherine! bring the things in: where are
you?''

<p/>Catherine reappeared, bearing a tray of knives and forks.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``You may get your dinner with Joseph,''  (<font color='red'><b>Heathcliff/Mr. Heathcliff</b></font>)</div>muttered Heathcliff, aside, `and
remain in the kitchen till he (<font color='blue'><b>Heathcliff</b></font>) is gone.''

<p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>Catherine</b></font>) obeyed his (<font color='blue'><b>Heathcliff</b></font>) directions very punctually: perhaps she (<font color='blue'><b>Catherine</b></font>) had no temptation
to transgress. Living among clowns and misanthropists, she (<font color='blue'><b>Catherine</b></font>) probably
cannot appreciate a better class of people when she (<font color='blue'><b>Catherine</b></font>) meets them.

<p/>With Mr. Heathcliff, grim and saturnine, on the one hand, and Hareton,
absolutely dumb, on the other, I made a somewhat cheerless meal, and bade
adieu early. I would have departed by the back way, to get a last
glimpse of Catherine and annoy old Joseph; but Hareton received orders to
lead up my horse, and my host himself escorted me to the door, so I could
not fulfil my wish.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``How dreary life gets over in that house!''  (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div>I reflected, while riding down
the road. <div class="bookquote">``What a realisation of something more romantic than a fairy
tale it would have been for Mrs. Linton Heathcliff, had she (<font color='blue'><b>Heathcliff</b></font>) and I struck
up an attachment, as her (<font color='blue'><b>Heathcliff</b></font>) good nurse desired, and migrated together into
the stirring atmosphere of the town!''




 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/>CHAPTER XXXII


<p/>1802.--This September I was invited to devastate the moors of a friend in
the north, and on my journey to his (<font color='blue'><b>friend</b></font>) abode, I unexpectedly came within
fifteen miles of Gimmerton. The ostler at a roadside public-house was
holding a pail of water to refresh my horses, when a cart of very green
oats, newly reaped, passed by, and he (<font color='blue'><b>ostler</b></font>) remarked,--<div class="bookquote">``Yon's frough Gimmerton,
nah! They're allas three wick' after other folk wi' ther harvest.''

 (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Gimmerton?''  (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div>I repeated--my residence in that locality had already grown
dim and dreamy. <div class="bookquote">``Ah! I know. How far is it from this?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Happen fourteen mile o'er th' hills; and a rough road,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>ostler</b></font>) answered.

<p/>A sudden impulse seized me to visit Thrushcross Grange. It was scarcely
noon, and I conceived that I might as well pass the night under my own
roof as in an inn. Besides, I could spare a day easily to arrange
matters with my landlord, and thus save myself the trouble of invading
the neighbourhood again. Having rested awhile, I directed my servant to
inquire the way to the village; and, with great fatigue to our beasts, we
managed the distance in some three hours.

<p/>I left him (<font color='blue'><b>servant</b></font>) there, and proceeded down the valley alone. The grey church
looked greyer, and the lonely churchyard lonelier. I distinguished a
moor-sheep cropping the short turf on the graves. It was sweet, warm
weather--too warm for travelling; but the heat did not hinder me from
enjoying the delightful scenery above and below: had I seen it nearer
August, I'm sure it would have tempted me to waste a month among its
solitudes. In winter nothing more dreary, in summer nothing more divine,
than those glens shut in by hills, and those bluff, bold swells of heath.

<p/>I reached the Grange before sunset, and knocked for admittance; but the
family had retreated into the back premises, I judged, by one thin, blue
wreath, curling from the kitchen chimney, and they did not hear. I rode
into the court. Under the porch, a girl of nine or ten sat knitting, and
an old woman reclined on the housesteps, smoking a meditative pipe.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Is Mrs. Dean within?''  (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div>I demanded of the dame.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Mistress Dean? Nay!''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) answered, `she (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) doesn't bide here: shoo's up at
th' Heights.''

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Are you the housekeeper, then?''  (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div>I continued.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Eea, aw keep th' hause,''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) replied.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Well, I'm Mr. Lockwood, the master. Are there any rooms to lodge me in,
I wonder? I wish to stay all night.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``T' maister!''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) cried in astonishment. ``Whet, whoiver knew yah wur
coming? Yah sud ha' send word. They's nowt norther dry nor mensful
abaht t' place: nowt there isn<div class="bookquote">``t!''

 (<font color='red'><b>She</b></font>)</div><p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) threw down her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) pipe and bustled in, the girl followed, and I entered
too; soon perceiving that her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) report was true, and, moreover, that I had
almost upset her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) wits by my unwelcome apparition, I bade her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) be composed.
I would go out for a walk; and, meantime she (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) must try to prepare a corner
of a sitting-room for me to sup in, and a bedroom to sleep in. No
sweeping and dusting, only good fire and dry sheets were necessary. She (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>)
seemed willing to do her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) best; though she (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) thrust the hearth-brush into
the grates in mistake for the poker, and malappropriated several other
articles of her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) craft: but I retired, confiding in her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) energy for a
resting-place against my return. Wuthering Heights was the goal of my
proposed excursion. An afterthought brought me back, when I had quitted
the court.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``All well at the Heights?''  (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div>I inquired of the woman.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Eea, f'r owt ee knaw!''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) answered, skurrying away with a pan of hot
cinders.

<p/>I would have asked why Mrs. Dean had deserted the Grange, but it was
impossible to delay her (<font color='blue'><b>Dean</b></font>) at such a crisis, so I turned away and made my
exit, rambling leisurely along, with the glow of a sinking sun behind,
and the mild glory of a rising moon in front--one fading, and the other
brightening--as I quitted the park, and climbed the stony by-road
branching off to Mr. Heathcliff's dwelling. Before I arrived in sight of
it, all that remained of day was a beamless amber light along the west:
but I could see every pebble on the path, and every blade of grass, by
that splendid moon. I had neither to climb the gate nor to knock--it
yielded to my hand. That is an improvement, I thought. And I noticed
another, by the aid of my nostrils; a fragrance of stocks and wallflowers
wafted on the air from amongst the homely fruit-trees.

<p/>Both doors and lattices were open; and yet, as is usually the case in a
coal-district, a fine red fire illumined the chimney: the comfort which
the eye derives from it renders the extra heat endurable. But the house
of Wuthering Heights is so large that the inmates have plenty of space
for withdrawing out of its influence; and accordingly what inmates there
were had stationed themselves not far from one of the windows. I could
both see them and hear them talk before I entered, and looked and
listened in consequence; being moved thereto by a mingled sense of
curiosity and envy, that grew as I lingered.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Con-_trary_!''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>said a voice as sweet as a silver bell. <div class="bookquote">``That for the
third time, you dunce! I'm not going to tell you again. Recollect, or
I'll pull your hair!''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Contrary, then,''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>answered another, in deep but softened tones. <div class="bookquote">``And now,
kiss me, for minding so well.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``No, read it over first correctly, without a single mistake.''

 (<font color='red'><b>The speaker</b></font>)</div><p/>The male speaker began to read: he (<font color='blue'><b>speaker</b></font>) was a young man, respectably dressed
and seated at a table, having a book before him (<font color='blue'><b>speaker</b></font>). His (<font color='blue'><b>speaker</b></font>) handsome features
glowed with pleasure, and his (<font color='blue'><b>speaker</b></font>) eyes kept impatiently wandering from the
page to a small white hand over his (<font color='blue'><b>speaker</b></font>) shoulder, which recalled him (<font color='blue'><b>speaker</b></font>) by a
smart slap on the cheek, whenever its owner detected such signs of
inattention. Its owner stood behind; her (<font color='blue'><b>speaker</b></font>) light, shining ringlets
blending, at intervals, with his (<font color='blue'><b>owner</b></font>) brown looks, as she (<font color='blue'><b>speaker</b></font>) bent to superintend
his (<font color='blue'><b>owner</b></font>) studies; and her (<font color='blue'><b>speaker</b></font>) face--it was lucky he (<font color='blue'><b>owner</b></font>) could not see her (<font color='blue'><b>speaker</b></font>) face, or he (<font color='blue'><b>owner</b></font>)
would never have been so steady. I could; and I bit my lip in spite, at
having thrown away the chance I might have had of doing something besides
staring at its smiting beauty.

<p/>The task was done, not free from further blunders; but the pupil claimed
a reward, and received at least five kisses; which, however, he (<font color='blue'><b>pupil</b></font>)
generously returned. Then they came to the door, and from their
conversation I judged they were about to issue out and have a walk on the
moors. I supposed I should be condemned in Hareton Earnshaw's heart, if
not by his (<font color='blue'><b>pupil</b></font>) mouth, to the lowest pit in the infernal regions if I showed
my unfortunate person in his (<font color='blue'><b>pupil</b></font>) neighbourhood then; and feeling very mean
and malignant, I skulked round to seek refuge in the kitchen. There was
unobstructed admittance on that side also; and at the door sat my old
friend Nelly Dean, sewing and singing a song; which was often interrupted
from within by harsh words of scorn and intolerance, uttered in far from
musical accents.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``I'd rayther, by th' haulf, hev' 'em swearing i' my lugs fro'h morn to
neeght, nor hearken ye hahsiver!''  (<font color='red'><b>the tenant</b></font>)</div>said the tenant of the kitchen, in
answer to an unheard speech of Nelly's. <div class="bookquote">``It's a blazing shame, that I
cannot oppen t' blessed Book, but yah set up them glories to sattan, and
all t' flaysome wickednesses that iver were born into th' warld! Oh!
ye're a raight nowt; and shoo's another; and that poor lad 'll be lost
atween ye. Poor lad!''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Nelly</b></font>) added, with a groan; `he (<font color='blue'><b>Nelly</b></font>)'s witched: I'm sartin
on't. Oh, Lord, judge 'em, for there's norther law nor justice among wer
rullers!''

<p/><div class="bookquote">``No! or we should be sitting in flaming fagots, I suppose,''  (<font color='red'><b>the singer</b></font>)</div>retorted the
singer. ``But wisht, old man, and read your Bible like a Christian, and
never mind me. This is ``Fairy Annie's Wedding<div class="bookquote">''--a bonny tune--it goes to
a dance.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Fairy Annie</b></font>)</div><p/>Mrs. Dean was about to recommence, when I advanced; and recognising me
directly, she (<font color='blue'><b>Dean</b></font>) jumped to her (<font color='blue'><b>Dean</b></font>) feet, crying--<div class="bookquote">``Why, bless you, Mr. Lockwood!
How could you think of returning in this way? All's shut up at
Thrushcross Grange. You should have given us notice!''

 (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I've arranged to be accommodated there, for as long as I shall stay,''  (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div>I
answered. <div class="bookquote">``I depart again to-morrow. And how are you transplanted here,
Mrs. Dean? tell me that.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Zillah left, and Mr. Heathcliff wished me to come, soon after you went
to London, and stay till you returned. But, step in, pray! Have you
walked from Gimmerton this evening?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``From the Grange,''  (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div>I replied; `and while they make me lodging room there,
I want to finish my business with your master; because I don't think of
having another opportunity in a hurry.''

<p/><div class="bookquote">``What business, sir?''  (<font color='red'><b>Nelly/Nelly Dean</b></font>)</div>said Nelly, conducting me into the house. <div class="bookquote">``He (<font color='blue'><b>Heathcliff</b></font>)'s
gone out at present, and won't return soon.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``About the rent,''  (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div>I answered.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Oh! then it is with Mrs. Heathcliff you must settle,''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Dean</b></font>) observed; `or
rather with me. She (<font color='blue'><b>Dean</b></font>) has not learnt to manage her (<font color='blue'><b>Dean</b></font>) affairs yet, and I act
for her (<font color='blue'><b>Dean</b></font>): there's nobody else.''

<p/>I looked surprised.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Ah! you have not heard of Heathcliff's death, I see,''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Dean</b></font>) continued.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Heathcliff dead!''  (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div>I exclaimed, astonished. <div class="bookquote">``How long ago?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Three months since: but sit down, and let me take your hat, and I'll
tell you all about it. Stop, you have had nothing to eat, have you?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I want nothing: I have ordered supper at home. You sit down too. I
never dreamt of his (<font color='blue'><b>Heathcliff</b></font>) dying! Let me hear how it came to pass. You say you
don't expect them back for some time--the young people?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``No--I have to scold them every evening for their late rambles: but they
don't care for me. At least, have a drink of our old ale; it will do you
good: you seem weary.''

 (<font color='red'><b>She</b></font>)</div><p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>Dean</b></font>) hastened to fetch it before I could refuse, and I heard Joseph asking
whether `it warn't a crying scandal that she (<font color='blue'><b>Dean</b></font>) should have followers at her (<font color='blue'><b>Dean</b></font>)
time of life? And then, to get them jocks out o' t' maister's cellar! He (<font color='blue'><b>Joseph</b></font>)
fair shaamed to `bide still and see it.''

<p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>Dean</b></font>) did not stay to retaliate, but re-entered in a minute, bearing a
reaming silver pint, whose contents I lauded with becoming earnestness.
And afterwards she (<font color='blue'><b>Dean</b></font>) furnished me with the sequel of Heathcliff's history.
He (<font color='blue'><b>Heathcliff</b></font>) had a `queer' end, as she (<font color='blue'><b>Dean</b></font>) expressed it.

<p/>I was summoned to Wuthering Heights, within a fortnight of your leaving
us, she (<font color='blue'><b>Dean</b></font>) said; and I obeyed joyfully, for Catherine's sake. My first
interview with her (<font color='blue'><b>Catherine</b></font>) grieved and shocked me: she (<font color='blue'><b>Catherine</b></font>) had altered so much since
our separation. Mr. Heathcliff did not explain his (<font color='blue'><b>Heathcliff</b></font>) reasons for taking a
new mind about my coming here; he (<font color='blue'><b>Heathcliff</b></font>) only told me he (<font color='blue'><b>Heathcliff</b></font>) wanted me, and he (<font color='blue'><b>Heathcliff</b></font>) was
tired of seeing Catherine: I must make the little parlour my
sitting-room, and keep her (<font color='blue'><b>Catherine</b></font>) with me. It was enough if he (<font color='blue'><b>Heathcliff</b></font>) were obliged to
see her (<font color='blue'><b>Catherine</b></font>) once or twice a day. She (<font color='blue'><b>Catherine</b></font>) seemed pleased at this arrangement; and,
by degrees, I smuggled over a great number of books, and other articles,
that had formed her (<font color='blue'><b>Catherine</b></font>) amusement at the Grange; and flattered myself we
should get on in tolerable comfort. The delusion did not last long.
Catherine, contented at first, in a brief space grew irritable and
restless. For one thing, she (<font color='blue'><b>Catherine</b></font>) was forbidden to move out of the garden, and
it fretted her (<font color='blue'><b>Catherine</b></font>) sadly to be confined to its narrow bounds as spring drew
on; for another, in following the house, I was forced to quit her (<font color='blue'><b>Catherine</b></font>)
frequently, and she (<font color='blue'><b>Catherine</b></font>) complained of loneliness: she (<font color='blue'><b>Catherine</b></font>) preferred quarrelling
with Joseph in the kitchen to sitting at peace in her (<font color='blue'><b>Catherine</b></font>) solitude. I did
not mind their skirmishes: but Hareton was often obliged to seek the
kitchen also, when the master wanted to have the house to himself! and
though in the beginning she (<font color='blue'><b>Catherine</b></font>) either left it at his (<font color='blue'><b>master</b></font>) approach, or quietly
joined in my occupations, and shunned remarking or addressing him (<font color='blue'><b>master</b></font>)--and
though he (<font color='blue'><b>master</b></font>) was always as sullen and silent as possible--after a while, she (<font color='blue'><b>Catherine</b></font>)
changed her (<font color='blue'><b>Catherine</b></font>) behaviour, and became incapable of letting him (<font color='blue'><b>master</b></font>) alone: talking
at him (<font color='blue'><b>master</b></font>); commenting on his (<font color='blue'><b>master</b></font>) stupidity and idleness; expressing her (<font color='blue'><b>Catherine</b></font>) wonder
how he (<font color='blue'><b>master</b></font>) could endure the life he (<font color='blue'><b>master</b></font>) lived--how he (<font color='blue'><b>master</b></font>) could sit a whole evening
staring into the fire, and dozing.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``He (<font color='blue'><b>Heathcliff</b></font>)'s just like a dog, is he (<font color='blue'><b>Heathcliff</b></font>) not, Ellen?''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Catherine</b></font>) once observed, `or a
cart-horse? He (<font color='blue'><b>master</b></font>) does his (<font color='blue'><b>master</b></font>) work, eats his (<font color='blue'><b>master</b></font>) food, and sleeps eternally! What
a blank, dreary mind he (<font color='blue'><b>master</b></font>) must have! Do you ever dream, Hareton? And, if
you do, what is it about? But you can't speak to me!''

<p/>Then she (<font color='blue'><b>Catherine</b></font>) looked at him (<font color='blue'><b>Hareton</b></font>); but he (<font color='blue'><b>Hareton</b></font>) would neither open his (<font color='blue'><b>Hareton</b></font>) mouth nor look
again.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``He (<font color='blue'><b>Heathcliff</b></font>)'s, perhaps, dreaming now,''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Catherine</b></font>) continued. <div class="bookquote">``He (<font color='blue'><b>Heathcliff</b></font>) twitched his (<font color='blue'><b>Heathcliff</b></font>) shoulder
as Juno twitches hers. Ask him (<font color='blue'><b>Heathcliff</b></font>), Ellen.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Mr. Hareton will ask the master to send you up-stairs, if you don't
behave!''  (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div>I said. He (<font color='blue'><b>Hareton</b></font>) had not only twitched his (<font color='blue'><b>Hareton</b></font>) shoulder but clenched his (<font color='blue'><b>Hareton</b></font>)
fist, as if tempted to use it.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``I know why Hareton never speaks, when I am in the kitchen,''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Catherine</b></font>)
exclaimed, on another occasion. <div class="bookquote">``He (<font color='blue'><b>Hareton</b></font>) is afraid I shall laugh at him (<font color='blue'><b>Hareton</b></font>).
Ellen, what do you think? He (<font color='blue'><b>Hareton</b></font>) began to teach himself to read once; and,
because I laughed, he (<font color='blue'><b>Hareton</b></font>) burned his (<font color='blue'><b>Hareton</b></font>) books, and dropped it: was he (<font color='blue'><b>Hareton</b></font>) not a
fool?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Were not you naughty?''  (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div>I said; `answer me that.''

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Perhaps I was,''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Catherine</b></font>) went on; `but I did not expect him (<font color='blue'><b>Hareton</b></font>) to be so silly.
Hareton, if I gave you a book, would you take it now? I'll try!''

<p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>Catherine</b></font>) placed one she (<font color='blue'><b>Catherine</b></font>) had been perusing on his (<font color='blue'><b>Hareton</b></font>) hand; he (<font color='blue'><b>Hareton</b></font>) flung it off, and
muttered, if she (<font color='blue'><b>Catherine</b></font>) did not give over, he (<font color='blue'><b>Hareton</b></font>) would break her (<font color='blue'><b>Catherine</b></font>) neck.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Well, I shall put it here,''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Catherine</b></font>) said, `in the table-drawer; and I'm
going to bed.''

<p/>Then she (<font color='blue'><b>Catherine</b></font>) whispered me to watch whether he (<font color='blue'><b>Hareton</b></font>) touched it, and departed. But
he (<font color='blue'><b>Hareton</b></font>) would not come near it; and so I informed her (<font color='blue'><b>Catherine</b></font>) in the morning, to her (<font color='blue'><b>Catherine</b></font>)
great disappointment. I saw she (<font color='blue'><b>Catherine</b></font>) was sorry for his (<font color='blue'><b>Hareton</b></font>) persevering sulkiness
and indolence: her (<font color='blue'><b>Catherine</b></font>) conscience reproved her (<font color='blue'><b>Catherine</b></font>) for frightening him (<font color='blue'><b>Hareton</b></font>) off
improving himself: she (<font color='blue'><b>Catherine</b></font>) had done it effectually. But her (<font color='blue'><b>Catherine</b></font>) ingenuity was at
work to remedy the injury: while I ironed, or pursued other such
stationary employments as I could not well do in the parlour, she (<font color='blue'><b>Catherine</b></font>) would
bring some pleasant volume and read it aloud to me. When Hareton was
there, she (<font color='blue'><b>Catherine</b></font>) generally paused in an interesting part, and left the book
lying about: that she (<font color='blue'><b>Catherine</b></font>) did repeatedly; but he (<font color='blue'><b>Hareton</b></font>) was as obstinate as a mule,
and, instead of snatching at her (<font color='blue'><b>Catherine</b></font>) bait, in wet weather he (<font color='blue'><b>Hareton</b></font>) took to smoking
with Joseph; and they sat like automatons, one on each side of the fire,
the elder happily too deaf to understand her (<font color='blue'><b>Catherine</b></font>) wicked nonsense, as he (<font color='blue'><b>Hareton</b></font>) would
have called it, the younger doing his (<font color='blue'><b>Hareton</b></font>) best to seem to disregard it. On
fine evenings the latter followed his (<font color='blue'><b>Hareton</b></font>) shooting expeditions, and Catherine
yawned and sighed, and teased me to talk to her (<font color='blue'><b>Catherine</b></font>), and ran off into the
court or garden the moment I began; and, as a last resource, cried, and
said she (<font color='blue'><b>Catherine</b></font>) was tired of living: her (<font color='blue'><b>Catherine</b></font>) life was useless.

<p/>Mr. Heathcliff, who grew more and more disinclined to society, had almost
banished Earnshaw from his (<font color='blue'><b>Heathcliff</b></font>) apartment. Owing to an accident at the
commencement of March, he (<font color='blue'><b>Heathcliff</b></font>) became for some days a fixture in the kitchen.
His (<font color='blue'><b>Heathcliff</b></font>) gun burst while out on the hills by himself; a splinter cut his (<font color='blue'><b>Heathcliff</b></font>) arm,
and he (<font color='blue'><b>Heathcliff</b></font>) lost a good deal of blood before he (<font color='blue'><b>Heathcliff</b></font>) could reach home. The
consequence was that, perforce, he (<font color='blue'><b>Heathcliff</b></font>) was condemned to the fireside and
tranquillity, till he (<font color='blue'><b>Heathcliff</b></font>) made it up again. It suited Catherine to have him (<font color='blue'><b>Heathcliff</b></font>)
there: at any rate, it made her (<font color='blue'><b>Catherine</b></font>) hate her (<font color='blue'><b>Catherine</b></font>) room up-stairs more than ever:
and she (<font color='blue'><b>Catherine</b></font>) would compel me to find out business below, that she (<font color='blue'><b>Catherine</b></font>) might
accompany me.

<p/>On Easter Monday, Joseph went to Gimmerton fair with some cattle; and, in
the afternoon, I was busy getting up linen in the kitchen. Earnshaw sat,
morose as usual, at the chimney corner, and my little mistress was
beguiling an idle hour with drawing pictures on the window-panes, varying
her (<font color='blue'><b>mistress</b></font>) amusement by smothered bursts of songs, and whispered ejaculations,
and quick glances of annoyance and impatience in the direction of her (<font color='blue'><b>mistress</b></font>)
cousin, who steadfastly smoked, and looked into the grate. At a notice
that I could do with her (<font color='blue'><b>mistress</b></font>) no longer intercepting my light, she (<font color='blue'><b>mistress</b></font>) removed to
the hearthstone. I bestowed little attention on her (<font color='blue'><b>mistress</b></font>) proceedings, but,
presently, I heard her (<font color='blue'><b>mistress</b></font>) begin--<div class="bookquote">``I've found out, Hareton, that I want--that
I'm glad--that I should like you to be my cousin now, if you had not
grown so cross to me, and so rough.''

 (<font color='red'><b>her</b></font>)</div><p/>Hareton returned no answer.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Hareton, Hareton, Hareton! do you hear?''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>mistress</b></font>) continued.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Get off wi' ye!''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Hareton</b></font>) growled, with uncompromising gruffness.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Let me take that pipe,''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>mistress</b></font>) said, cautiously advancing her (<font color='blue'><b>mistress</b></font>) hand and
abstracting it from his (<font color='blue'><b>Hareton</b></font>) mouth.

<p/>Before he (<font color='blue'><b>Hareton</b></font>) could attempt to recover it, it was broken, and behind the
fire. He (<font color='blue'><b>Hareton</b></font>) swore at her (<font color='blue'><b>mistress</b></font>) and seized another.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Stop,''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>mistress</b></font>) cried, `you must listen to me first; and I can't speak while
those clouds are floating in my face.''

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Will you go to the devil!''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Hareton</b></font>) exclaimed, ferociously, `and let me be!''

<p/><div class="bookquote">``No,''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>mistress</b></font>) persisted, <div class="bookquote">``I won't: I can't tell what to do to make you talk
to me; and you are determined not to understand. When I call you stupid,
I don't mean anything: I don't mean that I despise you. Come, you shall
take notice of me, Hareton: you are my cousin, and you shall own me.''

 (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I shall have naught to do wi' you and your mucky pride, and your damned
mocking tricks!''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Hareton</b></font>) answered. <div class="bookquote">``I'll go to hell, body and soul, before I
look sideways after you again. Side out o' t' gate, now, this minute!''

 (<font color='red'><b>Catherine/Earnshaw/Catherine Earnshaw</b></font>)</div><p/>Catherine frowned, and retreated to the window-seat chewing her (<font color='blue'><b>Catherine</b></font>) lip, and
endeavouring, by humming an eccentric tune, to conceal a growing tendency
to sob.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``You should be friends with your cousin, Mr. Hareton,''  (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div>I interrupted,
`since she (<font color='blue'><b>Catherine</b></font>) repents of her (<font color='blue'><b>Catherine</b></font>) sauciness. It would do you a great deal of
good: it would make you another man to have her (<font color='blue'><b>Catherine</b></font>) for a companion.''

<p/><div class="bookquote">``A companion!''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>companion</b></font>) cried; `when she (<font color='blue'><b>Catherine</b></font>) hates me, and does not think me fit to
wipe her (<font color='blue'><b>Catherine</b></font>) shoon! Nay, if it made me a king, I'd not be scorned for
seeking her (<font color='blue'><b>Catherine</b></font>) good-will any more.''

<p/><div class="bookquote">``It is not I who hate you, it is you who hate me!''  (<font color='red'><b>Cathy/Miss Cathy</b></font>)</div>wept Cathy, no longer
disguising her (<font color='blue'><b>Catherine</b></font>) trouble. <div class="bookquote">``You hate me as much as Mr. Heathcliff does, and
more.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``You're a damned liar,''  (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div>began Earnshaw: `why have I made him (<font color='blue'><b>king</b></font>) angry, by
taking your part, then, a hundred times? and that when you sneered at and
despised me, and--Go on plaguing me, and I'll step in yonder, and say you
worried me out of the kitchen!''

<p/><div class="bookquote">``I didn't know you took my part,''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Catherine</b></font>) answered, drying her (<font color='blue'><b>Catherine</b></font>) eyes; `and I
was miserable and bitter at everybody; but now I thank you, and beg you
to forgive me: what can I do besides?''

<p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>Catherine</b></font>) returned to the hearth, and frankly extended her (<font color='blue'><b>Catherine</b></font>) hand. He (<font color='blue'><b>king</b></font>) blackened
and scowled like a thunder-cloud, and kept his (<font color='blue'><b>king</b></font>) fists resolutely clenched,
and his (<font color='blue'><b>king</b></font>) gaze fixed on the ground. Catherine, by instinct, must have
divined it was obdurate perversity, and not dislike, that prompted this
dogged conduct; for, after remaining an instant undecided, she (<font color='blue'><b>Catherine</b></font>) stooped
and impressed on his (<font color='blue'><b>king</b></font>) cheek a gentle kiss. The little rogue thought I had
not seen her (<font color='blue'><b>Catherine</b></font>), and, drawing back, she (<font color='blue'><b>Catherine</b></font>) took her (<font color='blue'><b>Catherine</b></font>) former station by the
window, quite demurely. I shook my head reprovingly, and then she (<font color='blue'><b>Catherine</b></font>)
blushed and whispered--<div class="bookquote">``Well! what should I have done, Ellen? He (<font color='blue'><b>Heathcliff</b></font>)
wouldn't shake hands, and he (<font color='blue'><b>Heathcliff</b></font>) wouldn't look: I must show him (<font color='blue'><b>Heathcliff</b></font>) some way that
I like him (<font color='blue'><b>Heathcliff</b></font>)--that I want to be friends.''

 (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div><p/>Whether the kiss convinced Hareton, I cannot tell: he (<font color='blue'><b>Hareton</b></font>) was very careful,
for some minutes, that his (<font color='blue'><b>Hareton</b></font>) face should not be seen, and when he (<font color='blue'><b>Hareton</b></font>) did raise
it, he (<font color='blue'><b>Hareton</b></font>) was sadly puzzled where to turn his (<font color='blue'><b>Hareton</b></font>) eyes.

<p/>Catherine employed herself in wrapping a handsome book neatly in white
paper, and having tied it with a bit of ribbon, and addressed it to <div class="bookquote">``Mr.
Hareton Earnshaw,''  (<font color='red'><b>Catherine/Earnshaw/Catherine Earnshaw</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Catherine</b></font>) desired me to be her (<font color='blue'><b>Catherine</b></font>) ambassadress, and convey the
present to its destined recipient.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``And tell him (<font color='blue'><b>Mr.</b></font>), if he (<font color='blue'><b>Mr.</b></font>)'ll take it, I'll come and teach him (<font color='blue'><b>Mr.</b></font>) to read it
right,''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Catherine</b></font>) said; `and, if he (<font color='blue'><b>Hareton</b></font>) refuse it, I'll go upstairs, and never
tease him (<font color='blue'><b>Hareton</b></font>) again.''

<p/>I carried it, and repeated the message; anxiously watched by my employer.
Hareton would not open his (<font color='blue'><b>Hareton</b></font>) fingers, so I laid it on his (<font color='blue'><b>Hareton</b></font>) knee. He (<font color='blue'><b>Hareton</b></font>) did not
strike it off, either. I returned to my work. Catherine leaned her (<font color='blue'><b>Catherine</b></font>) head
and arms on the table, till she (<font color='blue'><b>Catherine</b></font>) heard the slight rustle of the covering
being removed; then she (<font color='blue'><b>Catherine</b></font>) stole away, and quietly seated herself beside her (<font color='blue'><b>Catherine</b></font>)
cousin. He (<font color='blue'><b>cousin</b></font>) trembled, and his (<font color='blue'><b>cousin</b></font>) face glowed: all his (<font color='blue'><b>cousin</b></font>) rudeness and all his (<font color='blue'><b>cousin</b></font>)
surly harshness had deserted him (<font color='blue'><b>cousin</b></font>): he (<font color='blue'><b>cousin</b></font>) could not summon courage, at first,
to utter a syllable in reply to her (<font color='blue'><b>Catherine</b></font>) questioning look, and her (<font color='blue'><b>Catherine</b></font>) murmured
petition.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Say you forgive me, Hareton, do. You can make me so happy by speaking
that little word.''

 (<font color='red'><b>He</b></font>)</div><p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>cousin</b></font>) muttered something inaudible.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``And you'll be my friend?''  (<font color='red'><b>Catherine/Earnshaw/Catherine Earnshaw</b></font>)</div>added Catherine, interrogatively.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Nay, you'll be ashamed of me every day of your life,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>cousin</b></font>) answered; `and
the more ashamed, the more you know me; and I cannot bide it.''

<p/><div class="bookquote">``So you won't be my friend?''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Catherine</b></font>) said, smiling as sweet as honey, and
creeping close up.

<p/>I overheard no further distinguishable talk, but, on looking round again,
I perceived two such radiant countenances bent over the page of the
accepted book, that I did not doubt the treaty had been ratified on both
sides; and the enemies were, thenceforth, sworn allies.

<p/>The work they studied was full of costly pictures; and those and their
position had charm enough to keep them unmoved till Joseph came home. He (<font color='blue'><b>Joseph</b></font>),
poor man, was perfectly aghast at the spectacle of Catherine seated on
the same bench with Hareton Earnshaw, leaning her (<font color='blue'><b>Catherine</b></font>) hand on his (<font color='blue'><b>Earnshaw</b></font>) shoulder;
and confounded at his (<font color='blue'><b>Earnshaw</b></font>) favourite's endurance of her (<font color='blue'><b>Catherine</b></font>) proximity: it affected
him (<font color='blue'><b>Earnshaw</b></font>) too deeply to allow an observation on the subject that night. His (<font color='blue'><b>Earnshaw</b></font>)
emotion was only revealed by the immense sighs he (<font color='blue'><b>Earnshaw</b></font>) drew, as he (<font color='blue'><b>Earnshaw</b></font>) solemnly
spread his (<font color='blue'><b>Earnshaw</b></font>) large Bible on the table, and overlaid it with dirty
bank-notes from his (<font color='blue'><b>Earnshaw</b></font>) pocket-book, the produce of the day's transactions.
At length he (<font color='blue'><b>Earnshaw</b></font>) summoned Hareton from his (<font color='blue'><b>Hareton</b></font>) seat.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Tak' these in to t' maister, lad,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Hareton</b></font>) said, `and bide there. I's gang
up to my own rahm. This hoile's neither mensful nor seemly for us: we
mun side out and seearch another.''

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Come, Catherine,''  (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div>I said, `we must <div class="bookquote">``side out''  (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div>too: I've done my ironing.
Are you ready to go?''

<p/>``It is not eight o<div class="bookquote">``clock!''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>we</b></font>) answered, rising unwillingly.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Hareton, I'll leave this book upon the chimney-piece, and I'll bring
some more to-morrow.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Ony books that yah leave, I shall tak' into th' hahse,''  (<font color='red'><b>Joseph</b></font>)</div>said Joseph,
`and it'll be mitch if yah find 'em agean; soa, yah may plase yerseln!''

<p/>Cathy threatened that his (<font color='blue'><b>Joseph</b></font>) library should pay for hers; and, smiling as
she (<font color='blue'><b>Cathy</b></font>) passed Hareton, went singing up-stairs: lighter of heart, I venture
to say, than ever she (<font color='blue'><b>Cathy</b></font>) had been under that roof before; except, perhaps,
during her (<font color='blue'><b>Cathy</b></font>) earliest visits to Linton.

<p/>The intimacy thus commenced grew rapidly; though it encountered temporary
interruptions. Earnshaw was not to be civilized with a wish, and my
young lady was no philosopher, and no paragon of patience; but both their
minds tending to the same point--one loving and desiring to esteem, and
the other loving and desiring to be esteemed--they contrived in the end
to reach it.

<p/>You see, Mr. Lockwood, it was easy enough to win Mrs. Heathcliff's heart.
But now, I'm glad you did not try. The crown of all my wishes will be
the union of those two. I shall envy no one on their wedding day: there
won't be a happier woman than myself in England!




<p/>CHAPTER XXXIII


<p/>On the morrow of that Monday, Earnshaw being still unable to follow his (<font color='blue'><b>Lockwood</b></font>)
ordinary employments, and therefore remaining about the house, I speedily
found it would be impracticable to retain my charge beside me, as
heretofore. She (<font color='blue'><b>Earnshaw</b></font>) got downstairs before me, and out into the garden, where
she (<font color='blue'><b>Earnshaw</b></font>) had seen her (<font color='blue'><b>Earnshaw</b></font>) cousin performing some easy work; and when I went to bid
them come to breakfast, I saw she (<font color='blue'><b>Earnshaw</b></font>) had persuaded him (<font color='blue'><b>cousin</b></font>) to clear a large
space of ground from currant and gooseberry bushes, and they were busy
planning together an importation of plants from the Grange.

<p/>I was terrified at the devastation which had been accomplished in a brief
half-hour; the black-currant trees were the apple of Joseph's eye, and
she (<font color='blue'><b>Earnshaw</b></font>) had just fixed her (<font color='blue'><b>Earnshaw</b></font>) choice of a flower-bed in the midst of them.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``There! That will be all shown to the master,''  (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div>I exclaimed, `the minute
it is discovered. And what excuse have you to offer for taking such
liberties with the garden? We shall have a fine explosion on the head of
it: see if we don't! Mr. Hareton, I wonder you should have no more wit
than to go and make that mess at her (<font color='blue'><b>Earnshaw</b></font>) bidding!''

<p/>``I'd forgotten they were Joseph``s,<div class="bookquote">'' answered Earnshaw, rather puzzled;
`but I'll tell him (<font color='blue'><b>Hareton</b></font>) I did it.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Heathcliff/Mr. Heathcliff</b></font>)</div><p/>We always ate our meals with Mr. Heathcliff. I held the mistress's post
in making tea and carving; so I was indispensable at table. Catherine
usually sat by me, but to-day she (<font color='blue'><b>Catherine</b></font>) stole nearer to Hareton; and I
presently saw she (<font color='blue'><b>Catherine</b></font>) would have no more discretion in her (<font color='blue'><b>Catherine</b></font>) friendship than
she (<font color='blue'><b>Catherine</b></font>) had in her (<font color='blue'><b>Catherine</b></font>) hostility.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Now, mind you don't talk with and notice your cousin too much,''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>were my
whispered instructions as we entered the room. <div class="bookquote">``It will certainly annoy
Mr. Heathcliff, and he (<font color='blue'><b>Heathcliff</b></font>)'ll be mad at you both.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I'm not going to,''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Catherine</b></font>) answered.

<p/>The minute after, she (<font color='blue'><b>Catherine</b></font>) had sidled to him (<font color='blue'><b>Heathcliff</b></font>), and was sticking primroses in
his (<font color='blue'><b>Heathcliff</b></font>) plate of porridge.

<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Heathcliff</b></font>) dared not speak to her (<font color='blue'><b>Catherine</b></font>) there: he (<font color='blue'><b>Heathcliff</b></font>) dared hardly look; and yet she (<font color='blue'><b>Catherine</b></font>) went
on teasing, till he (<font color='blue'><b>Heathcliff</b></font>) was twice on the point of being provoked to laugh. I
frowned, and then she (<font color='blue'><b>Catherine</b></font>) glanced towards the master: whose mind was occupied
on other subjects than his (<font color='blue'><b>master</b></font>) company, as his (<font color='blue'><b>master</b></font>) countenance evinced; and she (<font color='blue'><b>Catherine</b></font>)
grew serious for an instant, scrutinizing him (<font color='blue'><b>master</b></font>) with deep gravity.
Afterwards she (<font color='blue'><b>Catherine</b></font>) turned, and recommenced her (<font color='blue'><b>Catherine</b></font>) nonsense; at last, Hareton
uttered a smothered laugh. Mr. Heathcliff started; his (<font color='blue'><b>Heathcliff</b></font>) eye rapidly
surveyed our faces, Catherine met it with her (<font color='blue'><b>Catherine</b></font>) accustomed look of
nervousness and yet defiance, which he (<font color='blue'><b>Heathcliff</b></font>) abhorred.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``It is well you are out of my reach,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Heathcliff</b></font>) exclaimed. <div class="bookquote">``What fiend
possesses you to stare back at me, continually, with those infernal eyes?
Down with them! and don't remind me of your existence again. I thought I
had cured you of laughing.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``It was me,''  (<font color='red'><b>Hareton/Hareton Earnshaw/Earnshaw</b></font>)</div>muttered Hareton.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``What do you say?''  (<font color='red'><b>the master</b></font>)</div>demanded the master.

<p/>Hareton looked at his (<font color='blue'><b>Hareton</b></font>) plate, and did not repeat the confession. Mr.
Heathcliff looked at him (<font color='blue'><b>Heathcliff</b></font>) a bit, and then silently resumed his (<font color='blue'><b>Heathcliff</b></font>) breakfast
and his (<font color='blue'><b>Heathcliff</b></font>) interrupted musing. We had nearly finished, and the two young
people prudently shifted wider asunder, so I anticipated no further
disturbance during that sitting: when Joseph appeared at the door,
revealing by his (<font color='blue'><b>Joseph</b></font>) quivering lip and furious eyes that the outrage
committed on his (<font color='blue'><b>Joseph</b></font>) precious shrubs was detected. He (<font color='blue'><b>Joseph</b></font>) must have seen Cathy
and her (<font color='blue'><b>Cathy</b></font>) cousin about the spot before he (<font color='blue'><b>Joseph</b></font>) examined it, for while his (<font color='blue'><b>Joseph</b></font>) jaws
worked like those of a cow chewing its cud, and rendered his (<font color='blue'><b>Joseph</b></font>) speech
difficult to understand, he (<font color='blue'><b>Joseph</b></font>) began:--

<p/><div class="bookquote">``I mun hev' my wage, and I mun goa! I _hed_ aimed to dee wheare I'd
sarved fur sixty year; and I thowt I'd lug my books up into t' garret,
and all my bits o' stuff, and they sud hev' t' kitchen to theirseln; for
t' sake o' quietness. It wur hard to gie up my awn hearthstun, but I

 (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Now, now, idiot!''  (<font color='red'><b>Heathcliff/Mr. Heathcliff</b></font>)</div>interrupted Heathcliff, `cut it short! What's your
grievance? I'll interfere in no quarrels between you and Nelly. She (<font color='blue'><b>Cathy</b></font>) may
thrust you into the coal-hole for anything I care.''

<p/><div class="bookquote">``It's noan Nelly!''  (<font color='red'><b>Joseph</b></font>)</div>answered Joseph. <div class="bookquote">``I sudn't shift for Nelly--nasty ill

forgotten all I've done for him (<font color='blue'><b>lad</b></font>), and made on him (<font color='blue'><b>lad</b></font>), and goan and riven up a
whole row o' t' grandest currant-trees i' t' garden!''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>and here he (<font color='blue'><b>Joseph</b></font>)
lamented outright; unmanned by a sense of his (<font color='blue'><b>Joseph</b></font>) bitter injuries, and
Earnshaw's ingratitude and dangerous condition.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Is the fool drunk?''  (<font color='red'><b>Heathcliff/Mr. Heathcliff</b></font>)</div>asked Mr. Heathcliff. <div class="bookquote">``Hareton, is it you he (<font color='blue'><b>fool</b></font>)'s
finding fault with?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I've pulled up two or three bushes,''  (<font color='red'><b>the man</b></font>)</div>replied the young man; `but I'm
going to set 'em again.''

<p/><div class="bookquote">``And why have you pulled them up?''  (<font color='red'><b>the master</b></font>)</div>said the master.

<p/>Catherine wisely put in her (<font color='blue'><b>Catherine</b></font>) tongue.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``We wanted to plant some flowers there,''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Catherine</b></font>) cried. <div class="bookquote">``I'm the only person
to blame, for I wished him (<font color='blue'><b>fool</b></font>) to do it.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``And who the devil gave _you_ leave to touch a stick about the place?''
 (<font color='red'><b>father-in-law</b></font>)</div>demanded her (<font color='blue'><b>Catherine</b></font>) father-in-law, much surprised. <div class="bookquote">``And who ordered _you_ to
obey her (<font color='blue'><b>it</b></font>)?''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>father-in-law</b></font>) added, turning to Hareton.

<p/>The latter was speechless; his (<font color='blue'><b>father-in-law</b></font>) cousin replied--<div class="bookquote">``You shouldn't grudge a
few yards of earth for me to ornament, when you have taken all my land!''

 (<font color='red'><b>cousin</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Your land, insolent slut! You never had any,''  (<font color='red'><b>Heathcliff/Mr. Heathcliff</b></font>)</div>said Heathcliff.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``And my money,''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Catherine</b></font>) continued; returning his (<font color='blue'><b>Heathcliff</b></font>) angry glare, and meantime
biting a piece of crust, the remnant of her (<font color='blue'><b>Catherine</b></font>) breakfast.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Silence!''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Heathcliff</b></font>) exclaimed. <div class="bookquote">``Get done, and begone!''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``And Hareton's land, and his (<font color='blue'><b>Hareton</b></font>) money,''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>pursued the reckless thing. <div class="bookquote">``Hareton
and I are friends now; and I shall tell him (<font color='blue'><b>Hareton</b></font>) all about you!''

 (<font color='red'><b>The master</b></font>)</div><p/>The master seemed confounded a moment: he (<font color='blue'><b>master</b></font>) grew pale, and rose up, eyeing
her (<font color='blue'><b>Catherine</b></font>) all the while, with an expression of mortal hate.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``If you strike me, Hareton will strike you,''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Catherine</b></font>) said; `so you may as
well sit down.''

<p/><div class="bookquote">``If Hareton does not turn you out of the room, I'll strike him (<font color='blue'><b>Hareton</b></font>) to hell,''
 (<font color='red'><b>Heathcliff/Mr. Heathcliff</b></font>)</div>thundered Heathcliff. <div class="bookquote">``Damnable witch! dare you pretend to rouse him (<font color='blue'><b>Hareton</b></font>)
against me? Off with her (<font color='blue'><b>witch</b></font>)! Do you hear? Fling her (<font color='blue'><b>witch</b></font>) into the kitchen!
I'll kill her (<font color='blue'><b>witch</b></font>), Ellen Dean, if you let her (<font color='blue'><b>Dean</b></font>) come into my sight again!''

 (<font color='red'><b>Hareton/Hareton Earnshaw/Earnshaw</b></font>)</div><p/>Hareton tried, under his (<font color='blue'><b>Hareton</b></font>) breath, to persuade her (<font color='blue'><b>Catherine</b></font>) to go.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Drag her (<font color='blue'><b>Dean</b></font>) away!''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Hareton</b></font>) cried, savagely. <div class="bookquote">``Are you staying to talk?''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>And he (<font color='blue'><b>Hareton</b></font>)
approached to execute his (<font color='blue'><b>Hareton</b></font>) own command.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``He (<font color='blue'><b>Hareton</b></font>)'ll not obey you, wicked man, any more,''  (<font color='red'><b>Catherine/Earnshaw/Catherine Earnshaw</b></font>)</div>said Catherine; `and he (<font color='blue'><b>Hareton</b></font>)'ll
soon detest you as much as I do.''

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Wisht! wisht!''  (<font color='red'><b>the man</b></font>)</div>muttered the young man, reproachfully; <div class="bookquote">``I will not hear
you speak so to him (<font color='blue'><b>Hareton</b></font>). Have done.''

 (<font color='red'><b>the man</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``But you won't let him (<font color='blue'><b>Hareton</b></font>) strike me?''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Catherine</b></font>) cried.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Come, then,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) whispered earnestly.

<p/>It was too late: Heathcliff had caught hold of her (<font color='blue'><b>Catherine</b></font>).

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Now, _you_ go!''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Heathcliff</b></font>) said to Earnshaw. <div class="bookquote">``Accursed witch! this time she (<font color='blue'><b>witch</b></font>) has
provoked me when I could not bear it; and I'll make her (<font color='blue'><b>witch</b></font>) repent it for
ever!''

 (<font color='red'><b>He</b></font>)</div><p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Heathcliff</b></font>) had his (<font color='blue'><b>Heathcliff</b></font>) hand in her (<font color='blue'><b>Catherine</b></font>) hair; Hareton attempted to release her (<font color='blue'><b>Catherine</b></font>) locks,
entreating him (<font color='blue'><b>Hareton</b></font>) not to hurt her (<font color='blue'><b>Catherine</b></font>) that once. Heathcliff's black eyes
flashed; he (<font color='blue'><b>Heathcliff</b></font>) seemed ready to tear Catherine in pieces, and I was just
worked up to risk coming to the rescue, when of a sudden his (<font color='blue'><b>Heathcliff</b></font>) fingers
relaxed; he (<font color='blue'><b>Heathcliff</b></font>) shifted his (<font color='blue'><b>Heathcliff</b></font>) grasp from her (<font color='blue'><b>Catherine</b></font>) head to her (<font color='blue'><b>Catherine</b></font>) arm, and gazed
intently in her (<font color='blue'><b>Catherine</b></font>) face. Then he (<font color='blue'><b>Heathcliff</b></font>) drew his (<font color='blue'><b>Heathcliff</b></font>) hand over his (<font color='blue'><b>Heathcliff</b></font>) eyes, stood a
moment to collect himself apparently, and turning anew to Catherine,
said, with assumed calmness--<div class="bookquote">``You must learn to avoid putting me in a
passion, or I shall really murder you some time! Go with Mrs. Dean, and
keep with her (<font color='blue'><b>Dean</b></font>); and confine your insolence to her (<font color='blue'><b>Dean</b></font>) ears. As to Hareton
Earnshaw, if I see him (<font color='blue'><b>Earnshaw</b></font>) listen to you, I'll send him (<font color='blue'><b>Earnshaw</b></font>) seeking his (<font color='blue'><b>Earnshaw</b></font>) bread
where he (<font color='blue'><b>Earnshaw</b></font>) can get it! Your love will make him (<font color='blue'><b>Earnshaw</b></font>) an outcast and a beggar.
Nelly, take her (<font color='blue'><b>Dean</b></font>); and leave me, all of you! Leave me!''

 (<font color='red'><b>Catherine/Earnshaw/Catherine Earnshaw</b></font>)</div><p/>I led my young lady out: she (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) was too glad of her (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) escape to resist; the
other followed, and Mr. Heathcliff had the room to himself till dinner. I
had counselled Catherine to dine up-stairs; but, as soon as he (<font color='blue'><b>Heathcliff</b></font>) perceived
her (<font color='blue'><b>Catherine</b></font>) vacant seat, he (<font color='blue'><b>Heathcliff</b></font>) sent me to call her (<font color='blue'><b>Catherine</b></font>). He (<font color='blue'><b>Heathcliff</b></font>) spoke to none of us, ate
very little, and went out directly afterwards, intimating that he (<font color='blue'><b>Heathcliff</b></font>) should
not return before evening.

<p/>The two new friends established themselves in the house during his (<font color='blue'><b>Heathcliff</b></font>)
absence; where I heard Hareton sternly check his (<font color='blue'><b>Hareton</b></font>) cousin, on her (<font color='blue'><b>Catherine</b></font>) offering
a revelation of her (<font color='blue'><b>Catherine</b></font>) father-in-law's conduct to his (<font color='blue'><b>Hareton</b></font>) father. He (<font color='blue'><b>Hareton</b></font>) said he (<font color='blue'><b>Hareton</b></font>)
wouldn't suffer a word to be uttered in his (<font color='blue'><b>Hareton</b></font>) disparagement: if he (<font color='blue'><b>Hareton</b></font>) were the
devil, it didn't signify; he (<font color='blue'><b>Hareton</b></font>) would stand by him (<font color='blue'><b>Hareton</b></font>); and he (<font color='blue'><b>Hareton</b></font>)'d rather she (<font color='blue'><b>Catherine</b></font>)
would abuse himself, as she (<font color='blue'><b>Catherine</b></font>) used to, than begin on Mr. Heathcliff.
Catherine was waxing cross at this; but he (<font color='blue'><b>Heathcliff</b></font>) found means to make her (<font color='blue'><b>Catherine</b></font>) hold
her (<font color='blue'><b>Catherine</b></font>) tongue, by asking how she (<font color='blue'><b>Catherine</b></font>) would like _him (<font color='blue'><b>Heathcliff</b></font>)_ to speak ill of her (<font color='blue'><b>Catherine</b></font>)
father? Then she (<font color='blue'><b>Catherine</b></font>) comprehended that Earnshaw took the master's reputation
home to himself; and was attached by ties stronger than reason could
break--chains, forged by habit, which it would be cruel to attempt to
loosen. She (<font color='blue'><b>Earnshaw</b></font>) showed a good heart, thenceforth, in avoiding both
complaints and expressions of antipathy concerning Heathcliff; and
confessed to me her (<font color='blue'><b>Earnshaw</b></font>) sorrow that she (<font color='blue'><b>Earnshaw</b></font>) had endeavoured to raise a bad spirit
between him (<font color='blue'><b>Heathcliff</b></font>) and Hareton: indeed, I don't believe she (<font color='blue'><b>Earnshaw</b></font>) has ever breathed a
syllable, in the latter's hearing, against her (<font color='blue'><b>Earnshaw</b></font>) oppressor since.

<p/>When this slight disagreement was over, they were friends again, and as
busy as possible in their several occupations of pupil and teacher. I
came in to sit with them, after I had done my work; and I felt so soothed
and comforted to watch them, that I did not notice how time got on. You
know, they both appeared in a measure my children: I had long been proud
of one; and now, I was sure, the other would be a source of equal
satisfaction. His (<font color='blue'><b>pupil</b></font>) honest, warm, and intelligent nature shook off rapidly
the clouds of ignorance and degradation in which it had been bred; and
Catherine's sincere commendations acted as a spur to his (<font color='blue'><b>pupil</b></font>) industry. His (<font color='blue'><b>pupil</b></font>)
brightening mind brightened his (<font color='blue'><b>pupil</b></font>) features, and added spirit and nobility
to their aspect: I could hardly fancy it the same individual I had beheld
on the day I discovered my little lady at Wuthering Heights, after her (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>)
expedition to the Crags. While I admired and they laboured, dusk drew
on, and with it returned the master. He (<font color='blue'><b>master</b></font>) came upon us quite unexpectedly,
entering by the front way, and had a full view of the whole three, ere we
could raise our heads to glance at him (<font color='blue'><b>master</b></font>). Well, I reflected, there was
never a pleasanter, or more harmless sight; and it will be a burning
shame to scold them. The red fire-light glowed on their two bonny heads,
and revealed their faces animated with the eager interest of children;
for, though he (<font color='blue'><b>master</b></font>) was twenty-three and she (<font color='blue'><b>it</b></font>) eighteen, each had so much of
novelty to feel and learn, that neither experienced nor evinced the
sentiments of sober disenchanted maturity.

<p/>They lifted their eyes together, to encounter Mr. Heathcliff: perhaps you
have never remarked that their eyes are precisely similar, and they are
those of Catherine Earnshaw. The present Catherine has no other likeness
to her (<font color='blue'><b>Catherine</b></font>), except a breadth of forehead, and a certain arch of the nostril
that makes her (<font color='blue'><b>Catherine</b></font>) appear rather haughty, whether she (<font color='blue'><b>Catherine</b></font>) will or not. With
Hareton the resemblance is carried farther: it is singular at all times,
_then_ it was particularly striking; because his (<font color='blue'><b>Hareton</b></font>) senses were alert, and
his (<font color='blue'><b>Hareton</b></font>) mental faculties wakened to unwonted activity. I suppose this
resemblance disarmed Mr. Heathcliff: he (<font color='blue'><b>Heathcliff</b></font>) walked to the hearth in evident
agitation; but it quickly subsided as he (<font color='blue'><b>Heathcliff</b></font>) looked at the young man: or, I
should say, altered its character; for it was there yet. He (<font color='blue'><b>character</b></font>) took the
book from his (<font color='blue'><b>character</b></font>) hand, and glanced at the open page, then returned it
without any observation; merely signing Catherine away: her (<font color='blue'><b>Catherine</b></font>) companion
lingered very little behind her (<font color='blue'><b>Catherine</b></font>), and I was about to depart also, but he (<font color='blue'><b>companion</b></font>)
bid me sit still.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``It is a poor conclusion, is it not?''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>companion</b></font>) observed, having brooded awhile
on the scene he (<font color='blue'><b>companion</b></font>) had just witnessed: `an absurd termination to my violent
exertions? I get levers and mattocks to demolish the two houses, and
train myself to be capable of working like Hercules, and when everything
is ready and in my power, I find the will to lift a slate off either roof
has vanished! My old enemies have not beaten me; now would be the
precise time to revenge myself on their representatives: I could do it;
and none could hinder me. But where is the use? I don't care for
striking: I can't take the trouble to raise my hand! That sounds as if I
had been labouring the whole time only to exhibit a fine trait of
magnanimity. It is far from being the case: I have lost the faculty of
enjoying their destruction, and I am too idle to destroy for nothing.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Nelly, there is a strange change approaching; I'm in its shadow at
present. I take so little interest in my daily life that I hardly
remember to eat and drink. Those two who have left the room are the only
objects which retain a distinct material appearance to me; and that
appearance causes me pain, amounting to agony. About _her (<font color='blue'><b>Dean</b></font>)_ I won't
speak; and I don't desire to think; but I earnestly wish she (<font color='blue'><b>Dean</b></font>) were
invisible: her (<font color='blue'><b>Dean</b></font>) presence invokes only maddening sensations. _He (<font color='blue'><b>Nelly</b></font>)_ moves me
differently: and yet if I could do it without seeming insane, I'd never
see him (<font color='blue'><b>Nelly</b></font>) again! You'll perhaps think me rather inclined to become so,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>me</b></font>)
added, making an effort to smile, `if I try to describe the thousand
forms of past associations and ideas he (<font color='blue'><b>me</b></font>) awakens or embodies. But you'll
not talk of what I tell you; and my mind is so eternally secluded in
itself, it is tempting at last to turn it out to another.

<p/>``Five minutes ago Hareton seemed a personification of my youth, not a
human being; I felt to him (<font color='blue'><b>Hareton</b></font>) in such a variety of ways, that it would have
been impossible to have accosted him (<font color='blue'><b>Hareton</b></font>) rationally. In the first place, his (<font color='blue'><b>Hareton</b></font>)
startling likeness to Catherine connected him (<font color='blue'><b>Hareton</b></font>) fearfully with her (<font color='blue'><b>Catherine</b></font>). That,
however, which you may suppose the most potent to arrest my imagination,
is actually the least: for what is not connected with her (<font color='blue'><b>Catherine</b></font>) to me? and what
does not recall her (<font color='blue'><b>Catherine</b></font>)? I cannot look down to this floor, but her (<font color='blue'><b>Catherine</b></font>) features
are shaped in the flags! In every cloud, in every tree--filling the air
at night, and caught by glimpses in every object by day--I am surrounded
with her (<font color='blue'><b>Catherine</b></font>) image! The most ordinary faces of men and women--my own
features--mock me with a resemblance. The entire world is a dreadful
collection of memoranda that she (<font color='blue'><b>Catherine</b></font>) did exist, and that I have lost her (<font color='blue'><b>Catherine</b></font>)!
Well, Hareton's aspect was the ghost of my immortal love; of my wild
endeavours to hold my right; my degradation, my pride, my happiness, and
my anguish--

<p/><div class="bookquote">``But it is frenzy to repeat these thoughts to you: only it will let you
know why, with a reluctance to be always alone, his (<font color='blue'><b>Hareton</b></font>) society is no
benefit; rather an aggravation of the constant torment I suffer: and it
partly contributes to render me regardless how he (<font color='blue'><b>Hareton</b></font>) and his (<font color='blue'><b>Hareton</b></font>) cousin go on
together. I can give them no attention any more.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``But what do you mean by a _change_, Mr. Heathcliff?''  (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div>I said, alarmed at
his (<font color='blue'><b>me</b></font>) manner: though he (<font color='blue'><b>me</b></font>) was neither in danger of losing his (<font color='blue'><b>me</b></font>) senses, nor
dying, according to my judgment: he (<font color='blue'><b>me</b></font>) was quite strong and healthy; and, as
to his (<font color='blue'><b>me</b></font>) reason, from childhood he (<font color='blue'><b>me</b></font>) had a delight in dwelling on dark
things, and entertaining odd fancies. He (<font color='blue'><b>me</b></font>) might have had a monomania on
the subject of his (<font color='blue'><b>me</b></font>) departed idol; but on every other point his (<font color='blue'><b>me</b></font>) wits were
as sound as mine.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``I shall not know that till it comes,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>me</b></font>) said; <div class="bookquote">``I'm only half conscious
of it now.''

 (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``You have no feeling of illness, have you?''  (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div>I asked.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``No, Nelly, I have not,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>me</b></font>) answered.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Then you are not afraid of death?''  (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div>I pursued.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Afraid? No!''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>me</b></font>) replied. <div class="bookquote">``I have neither a fear, nor a presentiment,
nor a hope of death. Why should I? With my hard constitution and
temperate mode of living, and unperilous occupations, I ought to, and
probably _shall_, remain above ground till there is scarcely a black hair
on my head. And yet I cannot continue in this condition! I have to
remind myself to breathe--almost to remind my heart to beat! And it is
like bending back a stiff spring: it is by compulsion that I do the
slightest act not prompted by one thought; and by compulsion that I
notice anything alive or dead, which is not associated with one universal
idea. I have a single wish, and my whole being and faculties are
yearning to attain it. They have yearned towards it so long, and so
unwaveringly, that I'm convinced it will be reached--and soon--because it
has devoured my existence: I am swallowed up in the anticipation of its
fulfilment. My confessions have not relieved me; but they may account
for some otherwise unaccountable phases of humour which I show. O God!
It is a long fight; I wish it were over!''

 (<font color='red'><b>He</b></font>)</div><p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>me</b></font>) began to pace the room, muttering terrible things to himself, till I
was inclined to believe, as he (<font color='blue'><b>me</b></font>) said Joseph did, that conscience had
turned his (<font color='blue'><b>Joseph</b></font>) heart to an earthly hell. I wondered greatly how it would
end. Though he (<font color='blue'><b>Joseph</b></font>) seldom before had revealed this state of mind, even by
looks, it was his (<font color='blue'><b>Joseph</b></font>) habitual mood, I had no doubt: he (<font color='blue'><b>Joseph</b></font>) asserted it himself;
but not a soul, from his (<font color='blue'><b>Joseph</b></font>) general bearing, would have conjectured the
fact. You did not when you saw him (<font color='blue'><b>Joseph</b></font>), Mr. Lockwood: and at the period of
which I speak, he (<font color='blue'><b>Lockwood</b></font>) was just the same as then; only fonder of continued
solitude, and perhaps still more laconic in company.




<p/>CHAPTER XXXIV


<p/>For some days after that evening Mr. Heathcliff shunned meeting us at
meals; yet he (<font color='blue'><b>Heathcliff</b></font>) would not consent formally to exclude Hareton and Cathy. He (<font color='blue'><b>Heathcliff</b></font>)
had an aversion to yielding so completely to his (<font color='blue'><b>Heathcliff</b></font>) feelings, choosing
rather to absent himself; and eating once in twenty-four hours seemed
sufficient sustenance for him (<font color='blue'><b>Heathcliff</b></font>).

<p/>One night, after the family were in bed, I heard him (<font color='blue'><b>Heathcliff</b></font>) go downstairs, and
out at the front door. I did not hear him (<font color='blue'><b>Heathcliff</b></font>) re-enter, and in the morning I
found he (<font color='blue'><b>Heathcliff</b></font>) was still away. We were in April then: the weather was sweet
and warm, the grass as green as showers and sun could make it, and the
two dwarf apple-trees near the southern wall in full bloom. After
breakfast, Catherine insisted on my bringing a chair and sitting with my
work under the fir-trees at the end of the house; and she (<font color='blue'><b>Catherine</b></font>) beguiled
Hareton, who had perfectly recovered from his (<font color='blue'><b>Hareton</b></font>) accident, to dig and
arrange her (<font color='blue'><b>Catherine</b></font>) little garden, which was shifted to that corner by the
influence of Joseph's complaints. I was comfortably revelling in the
spring fragrance around, and the beautiful soft blue overhead, when my
young lady, who had run down near the gate to procure some primrose roots
for a border, returned only half laden, and informed us that Mr.
Heathcliff was coming in. <div class="bookquote">``And he (<font color='blue'><b>God</b></font>) spoke to me,''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) added, with a
perplexed countenance.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``What did he (<font color='blue'><b>God</b></font>) say?''  (<font color='red'><b>Hareton/Hareton Earnshaw/Earnshaw</b></font>)</div>asked Hareton.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``He (<font color='blue'><b>God</b></font>) told me to begone as fast as I could,''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) answered. <div class="bookquote">``But he (<font color='blue'><b>God</b></font>) looked
so different from his (<font color='blue'><b>God</b></font>) usual look that I stopped a moment to stare at
him (<font color='blue'><b>God</b></font>).''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``How?''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Hareton</b></font>) inquired.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Why, almost bright and cheerful. No, _almost_ nothing--_very much_
excited, and wild, and glad!''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) replied.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Night-walking amuses him (<font color='blue'><b>God</b></font>), then,''  (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div>I remarked, affecting a careless
manner: in reality as surprised as she (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) was, and anxious to ascertain the
truth of her (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) statement; for to see the master looking glad would not be
an every-day spectacle. I framed an excuse to go in. Heathcliff stood
at the open door; he (<font color='blue'><b>Heathcliff</b></font>) was pale, and he (<font color='blue'><b>Heathcliff</b></font>) trembled: yet, certainly, he (<font color='blue'><b>Heathcliff</b></font>) had a
strange joyful glitter in his (<font color='blue'><b>Heathcliff</b></font>) eyes, that altered the aspect of his (<font color='blue'><b>Heathcliff</b></font>) whole
face.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Will you have some breakfast?''  (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div>I said. <div class="bookquote">``You must be hungry, rambling
about all night!''  (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div>I wanted to discover where he (<font color='blue'><b>Heathcliff</b></font>) had been, but I did not
like to ask directly.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``No, I'm not hungry,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Heathcliff</b></font>) answered, averting his (<font color='blue'><b>Heathcliff</b></font>) head, and speaking rather
contemptuously, as if he (<font color='blue'><b>Heathcliff</b></font>) guessed I was trying to divine the occasion of
his (<font color='blue'><b>Heathcliff</b></font>) good humour.

<p/>I felt perplexed: I didn't know whether it were not a proper opportunity
to offer a bit of admonition.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``I don't think it right to wander out of doors,''  (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div>I observed, `instead of
being in bed: it is not wise, at any rate this moist season. I daresay
you'll catch a bad cold or a fever: you have something the matter with
you now!''

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Nothing but what I can bear,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Heathcliff</b></font>) replied; `and with the greatest
pleasure, provided you'll leave me alone: get in, and don't annoy me.''

<p/>I obeyed: and, in passing, I noticed he (<font color='blue'><b>Heathcliff</b></font>) breathed as fast as a cat.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Yes!''  (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div>I reflected to myself, `we shall have a fit of illness. I cannot
conceive what he (<font color='blue'><b>Heathcliff</b></font>) has been doing.''

<p/>That noon he (<font color='blue'><b>Heathcliff</b></font>) sat down to dinner with us, and received a heaped-up plate
from my hands, as if he (<font color='blue'><b>Heathcliff</b></font>) intended to make amends for previous fasting.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``I've neither cold nor fever, Nelly,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Heathcliff</b></font>) remarked, in allusion to my
morning's speech; `and I'm ready to do justice to the food you give me.''

<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Heathcliff</b></font>) took his (<font color='blue'><b>Heathcliff</b></font>) knife and fork, and was going to commence eating, when the
inclination appeared to become suddenly extinct. He (<font color='blue'><b>Heathcliff</b></font>) laid them on the
table, looked eagerly towards the window, then rose and went out. We saw
him (<font color='blue'><b>Heathcliff</b></font>) walking to and fro in the garden while we concluded our meal, and
Earnshaw said he (<font color='blue'><b>Heathcliff</b></font>)'d go and ask why he (<font color='blue'><b>Heathcliff</b></font>) would not dine: he (<font color='blue'><b>Heathcliff</b></font>) thought we had
grieved him (<font color='blue'><b>Heathcliff</b></font>) some way.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Well, is he (<font color='blue'><b>Nelly</b></font>) coming?''  (<font color='red'><b>Catherine/Earnshaw/Catherine Earnshaw</b></font>)</div>cried Catherine, when her (<font color='blue'><b>Catherine</b></font>) cousin returned.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Nay,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>cousin</b></font>) answered; `but he (<font color='blue'><b>cousin</b></font>)'s not angry: he (<font color='blue'><b>cousin</b></font>) seemed rarely pleased indeed;
only I made him (<font color='blue'><b>cousin</b></font>) impatient by speaking to him (<font color='blue'><b>cousin</b></font>) twice; and then he (<font color='blue'><b>cousin</b></font>) bid me be
off to you: he (<font color='blue'><b>cousin</b></font>) wondered how I could want the company of anybody else.''

<p/>I set his (<font color='blue'><b>cousin</b></font>) plate to keep warm on the fender; and after an hour or two he (<font color='blue'><b>cousin</b></font>)
re-entered, when the room was clear, in no degree calmer: the same
unnatural--it was unnatural--appearance of joy under his (<font color='blue'><b>cousin</b></font>) black brows; the
same bloodless hue, and his (<font color='blue'><b>cousin</b></font>) teeth visible, now and then, in a kind of
smile; his (<font color='blue'><b>cousin</b></font>) frame shivering, not as one shivers with chill or weakness,
but as a tight-stretched cord vibrates--a strong thrilling, rather than
trembling.

<p/>I will ask what is the matter, I thought; or who should? And I
exclaimed--<div class="bookquote">``Have you heard any good news, Mr. Heathcliff? You look
uncommonly animated.''

 (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Where should good news come from to me?''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>cousin</b></font>) said. <div class="bookquote">``I'm animated with
hunger; and, seemingly, I must not eat.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Your dinner is here,''  (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div>I returned; `why won't you get it?''

<p/><div class="bookquote">``I don't want it now,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>cousin</b></font>) muttered, hastily: <div class="bookquote">``I'll wait till supper. And,
Nelly, once for all, let me beg you to warn Hareton and the other away
from me. I wish to be troubled by nobody: I wish to have this place to
myself.''

 (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Is there some new reason for this banishment?''  (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div>I inquired. ``Tell me why
you are so queer, Mr. Heathcliff? Where were you last night? I'm not
putting the question through idle curiosity, but--'

<p/><div class="bookquote">``You are putting the question through very idle curiosity,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>cousin</b></font>)
interrupted, with a laugh. <div class="bookquote">``Yet I'll answer it. Last night I was on the
threshold of hell. To-day, I am within sight of my heaven. I have my
eyes on it: hardly three feet to sever me! And now you'd better go!
You'll neither see nor hear anything to frighten you, if you refrain from
prying.''

 (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div><p/>Having swept the hearth and wiped the table, I departed; more perplexed
than ever.

<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>cousin</b></font>) did not quit the house again that afternoon, and no one intruded on
his (<font color='blue'><b>cousin</b></font>) solitude; till, at eight o'clock, I deemed it proper, though
unsummoned, to carry a candle and his (<font color='blue'><b>cousin</b></font>) supper to him (<font color='blue'><b>cousin</b></font>). He (<font color='blue'><b>cousin</b></font>) was leaning
against the ledge of an open lattice, but not looking out: his (<font color='blue'><b>cousin</b></font>) face was
turned to the interior gloom. The fire had smouldered to ashes; the room
was filled with the damp, mild air of the cloudy evening; and so still,
that not only the murmur of the beck down Gimmerton was distinguishable,
but its ripples and its gurgling over the pebbles, or through the large
stones which it could not cover. I uttered an ejaculation of discontent
at seeing the dismal grate, and commenced shutting the casements, one
after another, till I came to his (<font color='blue'><b>Gimmerton</b></font>).

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Must I close this?''  (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div>I asked, in order to rouse him (<font color='blue'><b>Gimmerton</b></font>); for he (<font color='blue'><b>Gimmerton</b></font>) would not
stir.

<p/>The light flashed on his (<font color='blue'><b>Gimmerton</b></font>) features as I spoke. Oh, Mr. Lockwood, I cannot
express what a terrible start I got by the momentary view! Those deep
black eyes! That smile, and ghastly paleness! It appeared to me, not
Mr. Heathcliff, but a goblin; and, in my terror, I let the candle bend
towards the wall, and it left me in darkness.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Yes, close it,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Heathcliff</b></font>) replied, in his (<font color='blue'><b>Heathcliff</b></font>) familiar voice. <div class="bookquote">``There, that is pure
awkwardness! Why did you hold the candle horizontally? Be quick, and
bring another.''

 (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div><p/>I hurried out in a foolish state of dread, and said to Joseph--<div class="bookquote">``The
master wishes you to take him (<font color='blue'><b>master</b></font>) a light and rekindle the fire.''  (<font color='red'><b>Joseph</b></font>)</div>For I
dared not go in myself again just then.

<p/>Joseph rattled some fire into the shovel, and went: but he (<font color='blue'><b>Joseph</b></font>) brought it
back immediately, with the supper-tray in his (<font color='blue'><b>Joseph</b></font>) other hand, explaining that
Mr. Heathcliff was going to bed, and he (<font color='blue'><b>Heathcliff</b></font>) wanted nothing to eat till
morning. We heard him (<font color='blue'><b>Heathcliff</b></font>) mount the stairs directly; he (<font color='blue'><b>Heathcliff</b></font>) did not proceed to
his (<font color='blue'><b>Heathcliff</b></font>) ordinary chamber, but turned into that with the panelled bed: its
window, as I mentioned before, is wide enough for anybody to get through;
and it struck me that he (<font color='blue'><b>Heathcliff</b></font>) plotted another midnight excursion, of which he (<font color='blue'><b>Heathcliff</b></font>)
had rather we had no suspicion.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Is he (<font color='blue'><b>master</b></font>) a ghoul or a vampire?''  (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div>I mused. I had read of such hideous
incarnate demons. And then I set myself to reflect how I had tended him (<font color='blue'><b>Heathcliff</b></font>)
in infancy, and watched him (<font color='blue'><b>Heathcliff</b></font>) grow to youth, and followed him (<font color='blue'><b>Heathcliff</b></font>) almost
through his (<font color='blue'><b>Heathcliff</b></font>) whole course; and what absurd nonsense it was to yield to
that sense of horror. <div class="bookquote">``But where did he (<font color='blue'><b>master</b></font>) come from, the little dark
thing, harboured by a good man to his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) bane?''  (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div>muttered Superstition, as I
dozed into unconsciousness. And I began, half dreaming, to weary myself
with imagining some fit parentage for him (<font color='blue'><b>Heathcliff</b></font>); and, repeating my waking
meditations, I tracked his (<font color='blue'><b>Heathcliff</b></font>) existence over again, with grim variations; at
last, picturing his (<font color='blue'><b>Heathcliff</b></font>) death and funeral: of which, all I can remember is,
being exceedingly vexed at having the task of dictating an inscription
for his (<font color='blue'><b>Heathcliff</b></font>) monument, and consulting the sexton about it; and, as he (<font color='blue'><b>Heathcliff</b></font>) had no
surname, and we could not tell his (<font color='blue'><b>Heathcliff</b></font>) age, we were obliged to content
ourselves with the single word, <div class="bookquote">``Heathcliff.''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>That came true: we were.
If you enter the kirkyard, you'll read, on his (<font color='blue'><b>Heathcliff</b></font>) headstone, only that, and
the date of his (<font color='blue'><b>Heathcliff</b></font>) death.

<p/>Dawn restored me to common sense. I rose, and went into the garden, as
soon as I could see, to ascertain if there were any footmarks under his (<font color='blue'><b>Heathcliff</b></font>)
window. There were none. <div class="bookquote">``He (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) has stayed at home,''  (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div>I thought, `and he (<font color='blue'><b>Heathcliff</b></font>)'ll
be all right to-day.'' I prepared breakfast for the household, as was my
usual custom, but told Hareton and Catherine to get theirs ere the master
came down, for he (<font color='blue'><b>master</b></font>) lay late. They preferred taking it out of doors, under
the trees, and I set a little table to accommodate them.

<p/>On my re-entrance, I found Mr. Heathcliff below. He (<font color='blue'><b>Heathcliff</b></font>) and Joseph were
conversing about some farming business; he (<font color='blue'><b>Heathcliff</b></font>) gave clear, minute directions
concerning the matter discussed, but he (<font color='blue'><b>Heathcliff</b></font>) spoke rapidly, and turned his (<font color='blue'><b>Heathcliff</b></font>)
head continually aside, and had the same excited expression, even more
exaggerated. When Joseph quitted the room he (<font color='blue'><b>Joseph</b></font>) took his (<font color='blue'><b>Joseph</b></font>) seat in the place
he (<font color='blue'><b>Joseph</b></font>) generally chose, and I put a basin of coffee before him (<font color='blue'><b>Joseph</b></font>). He (<font color='blue'><b>Joseph</b></font>) drew it
nearer, and then rested his (<font color='blue'><b>Joseph</b></font>) arms on the table, and looked at the opposite
wall, as I supposed, surveying one particular portion, up and down, with
glittering, restless eyes, and with such eager interest that he (<font color='blue'><b>Joseph</b></font>) stopped
breathing during half a minute together.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Come now,''  (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div>I exclaimed, pushing some bread against his (<font color='blue'><b>Joseph</b></font>) hand, `eat and
drink that, while it is hot: it has been waiting near an hour.''

<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Joseph</b></font>) didn't notice me, and yet he (<font color='blue'><b>Joseph</b></font>) smiled. I'd rather have seen him (<font color='blue'><b>Joseph</b></font>) gnash
his (<font color='blue'><b>Joseph</b></font>) teeth than smile so.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Mr. Heathcliff! master!''  (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div>I cried, `don't, for God's sake, stare as if
you saw an unearthly vision.''

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Don't, for God's sake, shout so loud,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>God</b></font>) replied. <div class="bookquote">``Turn round, and
tell me, are we by ourselves?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Of course,''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>was my answer; `of course we are.''

<p/>Still, I involuntarily obeyed him (<font color='blue'><b>God</b></font>), as if I was not quite sure. With a
sweep of his (<font color='blue'><b>God</b></font>) hand he (<font color='blue'><b>God</b></font>) cleared a vacant space in front among the breakfast
things, and leant forward to gaze more at his (<font color='blue'><b>God</b></font>) ease.

<p/>Now, I perceived he (<font color='blue'><b>God</b></font>) was not looking at the wall; for when I regarded him (<font color='blue'><b>God</b></font>)
alone, it seemed exactly that he (<font color='blue'><b>God</b></font>) gazed at something within two yards'
distance. And whatever it was, it communicated, apparently, both
pleasure and pain in exquisite extremes: at least the anguished, yet
raptured, expression of his (<font color='blue'><b>God</b></font>) countenance suggested that idea. The fancied
object was not fixed, either: his (<font color='blue'><b>God</b></font>) eyes pursued it with unwearied
diligence, and, even in speaking to me, were never weaned away. I vainly
reminded him (<font color='blue'><b>God</b></font>) of his (<font color='blue'><b>God</b></font>) protracted abstinence from food: if he (<font color='blue'><b>God</b></font>) stirred to
touch anything in compliance with my entreaties, if he (<font color='blue'><b>God</b></font>) stretched his (<font color='blue'><b>God</b></font>) hand
out to get a piece of bread, his (<font color='blue'><b>God</b></font>) fingers clenched before they reached it,
and remained on the table, forgetful of their aim.

<p/>I sat, a model of patience, trying to attract his (<font color='blue'><b>God</b></font>) absorbed attention from
its engrossing speculation; till he (<font color='blue'><b>God</b></font>) grew irritable, and got up, asking
why I would not allow him (<font color='blue'><b>God</b></font>) to have his (<font color='blue'><b>God</b></font>) own time in taking his (<font color='blue'><b>God</b></font>) meals? and
saying that on the next occasion I needn't wait: I might set the things
down and go. Having uttered these words he (<font color='blue'><b>God</b></font>) left the house, slowly
sauntered down the garden path, and disappeared through the gate.

<p/>The hours crept anxiously by: another evening came. I did not retire to
rest till late, and when I did, I could not sleep. He (<font color='blue'><b>God</b></font>) returned after
midnight, and, instead of going to bed, shut himself into the room
beneath. I listened, and tossed about, and, finally, dressed and
descended. It was too irksome to lie there, harassing my brain with a
hundred idle misgivings.

<p/>I distinguished Mr. Heathcliff's step, restlessly measuring the floor,
and he (<font color='blue'><b>Heathcliff</b></font>) frequently broke the silence by a deep inspiration, resembling a
groan. He (<font color='blue'><b>Heathcliff</b></font>) muttered detached words also; the only one I could catch was
the name of Catherine, coupled with some wild term of endearment or
suffering; and spoken as one would speak to a person present; low and
earnest, and wrung from the depth of his (<font color='blue'><b>Heathcliff</b></font>) soul. I had not courage to walk
straight into the apartment; but I desired to divert him (<font color='blue'><b>Heathcliff</b></font>) from his (<font color='blue'><b>Heathcliff</b></font>)
reverie, and therefore fell foul of the kitchen fire, stirred it, and
began to scrape the cinders. It drew him (<font color='blue'><b>Heathcliff</b></font>) forth sooner than I expected.
He (<font color='blue'><b>Heathcliff</b></font>) opened the door immediately, and said--<div class="bookquote">``Nelly, come here--is it
morning? Come in with your light.''

 (<font color='red'><b>He</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``It is striking four,''  (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div>I answered. <div class="bookquote">``You want a candle to take up-stairs:
you might have lit one at this fire.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``No, I don't wish to go up-stairs,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Heathcliff</b></font>) said. <div class="bookquote">``Come in, and kindle _me_ a
fire, and do anything there is to do about the room.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I must blow the coals red first, before I can carry any,''  (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div>I replied,
getting a chair and the bellows.

<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Heathcliff</b></font>) roamed to and fro, meantime, in a state approaching distraction; his (<font color='blue'><b>Heathcliff</b></font>)
heavy sighs succeeding each other so thick as to leave no space for
common breathing between.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``When day breaks I'll send for Green,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Heathcliff</b></font>) said; <div class="bookquote">``I wish to make some
legal inquiries of him (<font color='blue'><b>Green</b></font>) while I can bestow a thought on those matters, and
while I can act calmly. I have not written my will yet; and how to leave
my property I cannot determine. I wish I could annihilate it from the
face of the earth.''

 (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I would not talk so, Mr. Heathcliff,''  (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div>I interposed. <div class="bookquote">``Let your will be a
while: you'll be spared to repent of your many injustices yet! I never
expected that your nerves would be disordered: they are, at present,
marvellously so, however; and almost entirely through your own fault.
The way you've passed these three last days might knock up a Titan. Do
take some food, and some repose. You need only look at yourself in a
glass to see how you require both. Your cheeks are hollow, and your eyes
blood-shot, like a person starving with hunger and going blind with loss
of sleep.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``It is not my fault that I cannot eat or rest,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Heathcliff</b></font>) replied. <div class="bookquote">``I assure
you it is through no settled designs. I'll do both, as soon as I
possibly can. But you might as well bid a man struggling in the water
rest within arms' length of the shore! I must reach it first, and then
I'll rest. Well, never mind Mr. Green: as to repenting of my injustices,
I've done no injustice, and I repent of nothing. I'm too happy; and yet
I'm not happy enough. My soul's bliss kills my body, but does not
satisfy itself.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Happy, master?''  (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div>I cried. <div class="bookquote">``Strange happiness! If you would hear me
without being angry, I might offer some advice that would make you
happier.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``What is that?''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Heathcliff</b></font>) asked. <div class="bookquote">``Give it.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``You are aware, Mr. Heathcliff,''  (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div>I said, `that from the time you were
thirteen years old you have lived a selfish, unchristian life; and
probably hardly had a Bible in your hands during all that period. You
must have forgotten the contents of the book, and you may not have space
to search it now. Could it be hurtful to send for some one--some
minister of any denomination, it does not matter which--to explain it,
and show you how very far you have erred from its precepts; and how unfit
you will be for its heaven, unless a change takes place before you die?''

<p/><div class="bookquote">``I'm rather obliged than angry, Nelly,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>minister</b></font>) said, `for you remind me of
the manner in which I desire to be buried. It is to be carried to the
churchyard in the evening. You and Hareton may, if you please, accompany
me: and mind, particularly, to notice that the sexton obeys my directions
concerning the two coffins! No minister need come; nor need anything be
said over me.--I tell you I have nearly attained _my_ heaven; and that of
others is altogether unvalued and uncoveted by me.''

<p/><div class="bookquote">``And supposing you persevered in your obstinate fast, and died by that
means, and they refused to bury you in the precincts of the kirk?''  (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div>I
said, shocked at his (<font color='blue'><b>minister</b></font>) godless indifference. <div class="bookquote">``How would you like it?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``They won't do that,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>minister</b></font>) replied: `if they did, you must have me removed
secretly; and if you neglect it you shall prove, practically, that the
dead are not annihilated!''

<p/>As soon as he (<font color='blue'><b>minister</b></font>) heard the other members of the family stirring he (<font color='blue'><b>minister</b></font>) retired
to his (<font color='blue'><b>minister</b></font>) den, and I breathed freer. But in the afternoon, while Joseph and
Hareton were at their work, he (<font color='blue'><b>Joseph</b></font>) came into the kitchen again, and, with a
wild look, bid me come and sit in the house: he (<font color='blue'><b>Joseph</b></font>) wanted somebody with him (<font color='blue'><b>Joseph</b></font>).
I declined; telling him (<font color='blue'><b>Joseph</b></font>) plainly that his (<font color='blue'><b>Joseph</b></font>) strange talk and manner
frightened me, and I had neither the nerve nor the will to be his (<font color='blue'><b>Joseph</b></font>)
companion alone.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``I believe you think me a fiend,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Joseph</b></font>) said, with his (<font color='blue'><b>Joseph</b></font>) dismal laugh:
`something too horrible to live under a decent roof.'' Then turning to
Catherine, who was there, and who drew behind me at his (<font color='blue'><b>Joseph</b></font>) approach, he (<font color='blue'><b>Joseph</b></font>)
added, half sneeringly,--<div class="bookquote">``Will _you_ come, chuck? I'll not hurt you. No!
to you I've made myself worse than the devil. Well, there is _one_ who
won't shrink from my company! By God! she (<font color='blue'><b>you</b></font>)'s relentless. Oh, damn it!
It's unutterably too much for flesh and blood to bear--even mine.''

 (<font color='red'><b>He</b></font>)</div><p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Joseph</b></font>) solicited the society of no one more. At dusk he (<font color='blue'><b>Joseph</b></font>) went into his (<font color='blue'><b>Joseph</b></font>)
chamber. Through the whole night, and far into the morning, we heard him (<font color='blue'><b>Joseph</b></font>)
groaning and murmuring to himself. Hareton was anxious to enter; but I
bid him (<font color='blue'><b>Hareton</b></font>) fetch Mr. Kenneth, and he (<font color='blue'><b>Hareton</b></font>) should go in and see him (<font color='blue'><b>Hareton</b></font>). When he (<font color='blue'><b>Hareton</b></font>)
came, and I requested admittance and tried to open the door, I found it
locked; and Heathcliff bid us be damned. He (<font color='blue'><b>Heathcliff</b></font>) was better, and would be
left alone; so the doctor went away.

<p/>The following evening was very wet: indeed, it poured down till day-dawn;
and, as I took my morning walk round the house, I observed the master's
window swinging open, and the rain driving straight in. He (<font color='blue'><b>master</b></font>) cannot be in
bed, I thought: those showers would drench him (<font color='blue'><b>master</b></font>) through. He (<font color='blue'><b>master</b></font>) must either
be up or out. But I'll make no more ado, I'll go boldly and look.''

<p/>Having succeeded in obtaining entrance with another key, I ran to unclose
the panels, for the chamber was vacant; quickly pushing them aside, I
peeped in. Mr. Heathcliff was there--laid on his (<font color='blue'><b>Heathcliff</b></font>) back. His (<font color='blue'><b>Heathcliff</b></font>) eyes met
mine so keen and fierce, I started; and then he (<font color='blue'><b>Heathcliff</b></font>) seemed to smile. I could
not think him (<font color='blue'><b>Heathcliff</b></font>) dead: but his (<font color='blue'><b>Heathcliff</b></font>) face and throat were washed with rain; the
bed-clothes dripped, and he (<font color='blue'><b>Heathcliff</b></font>) was perfectly still. The lattice, flapping
to and fro, had grazed one hand that rested on the sill; no blood
trickled from the broken skin, and when I put my fingers to it, I could
doubt no more: he (<font color='blue'><b>Heathcliff</b></font>) was dead and stark!

<p/>I hasped the window; I combed his (<font color='blue'><b>Heathcliff</b></font>) black long hair from his (<font color='blue'><b>Heathcliff</b></font>) forehead; I
tried to close his (<font color='blue'><b>Heathcliff</b></font>) eyes: to extinguish, if possible, that frightful,
life-like gaze of exultation before any one else beheld it. They would
not shut: they seemed to sneer at my attempts; and his (<font color='blue'><b>Heathcliff</b></font>) parted lips and
sharp white teeth sneered too! Taken with another fit of cowardice, I
cried out for Joseph. Joseph shuffled up and made a noise, but
resolutely refused to meddle with him (<font color='blue'><b>Joseph</b></font>).

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Th' divil's harried off his (<font color='blue'><b>God</b></font>) soul,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Joseph</b></font>) cried, `and he (<font color='blue'><b>Joseph</b></font>) may hev' his (<font color='blue'><b>Joseph</b></font>)
carcass into t' bargin, for aught I care! Ech! what a wicked `un he (<font color='blue'><b>Joseph</b></font>)
looks, girning at death!'' and the old sinner grinned in mockery. I
thought he (<font color='blue'><b>sinner</b></font>) intended to cut a caper round the bed; but suddenly composing
himself, he (<font color='blue'><b>sinner</b></font>) fell on his (<font color='blue'><b>sinner</b></font>) knees, and raised his (<font color='blue'><b>sinner</b></font>) hands, and returned thanks
that the lawful master and the ancient stock were restored to their
rights.

<p/>I felt stunned by the awful event; and my memory unavoidably recurred to
former times with a sort of oppressive sadness. But poor Hareton, the
most wronged, was the only one who really suffered much. He (<font color='blue'><b>Hareton</b></font>) sat by the
corpse all night, weeping in bitter earnest. He (<font color='blue'><b>Hareton</b></font>) pressed its hand, and
kissed the sarcastic, savage face that every one else shrank from
contemplating; and bemoaned him (<font color='blue'><b>Hareton</b></font>) with that strong grief which springs
naturally from a generous heart, though it be tough as tempered steel.

<p/>Mr. Kenneth was perplexed to pronounce of what disorder the master died.
I concealed the fact of his (<font color='blue'><b>master</b></font>) having swallowed nothing for four days,
fearing it might lead to trouble, and then, I am persuaded, he (<font color='blue'><b>master</b></font>) did not
abstain on purpose: it was the consequence of his (<font color='blue'><b>master</b></font>) strange illness, not
the cause.

<p/>We buried him (<font color='blue'><b>master</b></font>), to the scandal of the whole neighbourhood, as he (<font color='blue'><b>master</b></font>) wished.
Earnshaw and I, the sexton, and six men to carry the coffin, comprehended
the whole attendance. The six men departed when they had let it down
into the grave: we stayed to see it covered. Hareton, with a streaming
face, dug green sods, and laid them over the brown mould himself: at
present it is as smooth and verdant as its companion mounds--and I hope
its tenant sleeps as soundly. But the country folks, if you ask them,
would swear on the Bible that he (<font color='blue'><b>companion</b></font>) _walks_: there are those who speak to
having met him (<font color='blue'><b>companion</b></font>) near the church, and on the moor, and even within this
house. Idle tales, you'll say, and so say I. Yet that old man by the
kitchen fire affirms he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) has seen two on 'em looking out of his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) chamber
window on every rainy night since his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) death:--and an odd thing happened
to me about a month ago. I was going to the Grange one evening--a dark
evening, threatening thunder--and, just at the turn of the Heights, I
encountered a little boy with a sheep and two lambs before him (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>); he (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>) was
crying terribly; and I supposed the lambs were skittish, and would not be
guided.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``What is the matter, my little man?''  (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div>I asked.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``There's Heathcliff and a woman yonder, under t' nab,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>) blubbered, `un'
I darnut pass <div class="bookquote">``em.''

 (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div><p/>I saw nothing; but neither the sheep nor he (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>) would go on so I bid him (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>) take
the road lower down. He (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>) probably raised the phantoms from thinking, as
he (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>) traversed the moors alone, on the nonsense he (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>) had heard his (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>) parents
and companions repeat. Yet, still, I don't like being out in the dark
now; and I don't like being left by myself in this grim house: I cannot
help it; I shall be glad when they leave it, and shift to the Grange.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``They are going to the Grange, then?''  (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div>I said.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Yes,''  (<font color='red'><b>Mrs. Dean</b></font>)</div>answered Mrs. Dean, `as soon as they are married, and that will be
on New Year's Day.''

<p/><div class="bookquote">``And who will live here then?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Why, Joseph will take care of the house, and, perhaps, a lad to keep him (<font color='blue'><b>lad</b></font>)
company. They will live in the kitchen, and the rest will be shut up.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``For the use of such ghosts as choose to inhabit it?''  (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div>I observed.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``No, Mr. Lockwood,''  (<font color='red'><b>Nelly/Nelly Dean</b></font>)</div>said Nelly, shaking her (<font color='blue'><b>Dean</b></font>) head. <div class="bookquote">``I believe the dead
are at peace: but it is not right to speak of them with levity.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/>At that moment the garden gate swung to; the ramblers were returning.

<p/>'_They_ are afraid of nothing,'' I grumbled, watching their approach
through the window. <div class="bookquote">``Together, they would brave Satan and all his (<font color='blue'><b>Satan</b></font>)
legions.''

 (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div><p/>As they stepped on to the door-stones, and halted to take a last look at
the moon--or, more correctly, at each other by her (<font color='blue'><b>Dean</b></font>) light--I felt
irresistibly impelled to escape them again; and, pressing a remembrance
into the hand of Mrs. Dean, and disregarding her (<font color='blue'><b>Dean</b></font>) expostulations at my
rudeness, I vanished through the kitchen as they opened the house-door;
and so should have confirmed Joseph in his (<font color='blue'><b>Joseph</b></font>) opinion of his (<font color='blue'><b>Joseph</b></font>)
fellow-servant's gay indiscretions, had he (<font color='blue'><b>Joseph</b></font>) not fortunately recognised me
for a respectable character by the sweet ring of a sovereign at his (<font color='blue'><b>Joseph</b></font>) feet.

<p/>My walk home was lengthened by a diversion in the direction of the kirk.
When beneath its walls, I perceived decay had made progress, even in
seven months: many a window showed black gaps deprived of glass; and
slates jutted off here and there, beyond the right line of the roof, to
be gradually worked off in coming autumn storms.

<p/>I sought, and soon discovered, the three headstones on the slope next the
moor: the middle one grey, and half buried in the heath; Edgar Linton's
only harmonized by the turf and moss creeping up its foot; Heathcliff's
still bare.

<p/>I lingered round them, under that benign sky: watched the moths
fluttering among the heath and harebells, listened to the soft wind
breathing through the grass, and wondered how any one could ever imagine
unquiet slumbers for the sleepers in that quiet earth.

<p/>1.F.

<p/>1.F.1. Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable
effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread
public domain works in creating the Project Gutenberg-tm
collection. Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may contain
<div class="bookquote">``Defects,''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate or
corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other intellectual
property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or other medium, a
computer virus, or computer codes that damage or cannot be read by
your equipment.

<p/>1.F.2. LIMITED WARRANTY, DISCLAIMER OF DAMAGES - Except for the <div class="bookquote">``Right
of Replacement or Refund''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>described in paragraph 1.F.3, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation, the owner of the Project
Gutenberg-tm trademark, and any other party distributing a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work under this agreement, disclaim all
liability to you for damages, costs and expenses, including legal

LIABILITY, BREACH OF WARRANTY OR BREACH OF CONTRACT EXCEPT THOSE
PROVIDED IN PARAGRAPH F3. YOU AGREE THAT THE FOUNDATION, THE

defect in this electronic work within 90 days of receiving it, you can
receive a refund of the money -LRB-if any-RRB- you paid for it by sending a
written explanation to the person you received the work from. If you
received the work on a physical medium, you must return the medium with
your written explanation. The person or entity that provided you with
the defective work may elect to provide a replacement copy in lieu of a
refund. If you received the work electronically, the person or entity
providing it to you may choose to give you a second opportunity to
receive the work electronically in lieu of a refund. If the second copy
is also defective, you may demand a refund in writing without further

warranties or the exclusion or limitation of certain types of damages.
If any disclaimer or limitation set forth in this agreement violates the
law of the state applicable to this agreement, the agreement shall be

the applicable state law. The invalidity or unenforceability of any
provision of this agreement shall not void the remaining provisions.

or cause to occur: -LRB-a-RRB- distribution of this or any Project Gutenberg-tm
work, -LRB-b-RRB- alteration, modification, or additions or deletions to any
Project Gutenberg-tm work, and -LRB-c-RRB- any Defect you cause.


<p/>Section 2. Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

<p/>Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of computers
including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers. It exists
because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations from
people in all walks of life.

<p/>Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need, is critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come. In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future generations.
To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation
and how your efforts and donations can help, see Sections 3 and 4
and the Foundation web page at http://www.gutenberg.org/fundraising/pglaf.

<p/>Section 4. Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

<p/>Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment. Many small donations
-LRB-$1 to $5,000-RRB- are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

<p/>The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States. Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements. We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance. To
SEND DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any
particular state visit http://www.gutenberg.org/fundraising/donate

<p/>While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

<p/>International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States. U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

<p/>Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses. Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations.

<p/>Section 5. General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works.

<p/>Professor Michael S. Hart is the originator of the Project Gutenberg-tm
concept of a library of electronic works that could be freely shared
with anyone. For thirty years, he (<font color='blue'><b>Hart</b></font>) produced and distributed Project
Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of volunteer support.

<p/>Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as Public Domain in the U.S.
unless a copyright notice is included. Thus, we do not necessarily
keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper edition.

<p/>Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search facility:

<p/>http://www.gutenberg.org

<p/>This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
