<p/>TOM BROWN'S SCHOOLDAYS

<p/>By Thomas Hughes




<p/>PART I.



<p/>CHAPTER I--THE BROWN FAMILY

<p/><div class="bookquote">``I'm the Poet of White Horse Vale, sir,
With liberal notions under my cap.'' (<font color='red'><b>THE BROWN FAMILY Poet</b></font>)</div>--Ballad

<p/>The Browns have become illustrious by the pen of Thackeray and the
pencil of Doyle, within the memory of the young gentlemen who are now
matriculating at the universities. Notwithstanding the well-merited but
late fame which has now fallen upon them, any one at all acquainted with
the family must feel that much has yet to be written and said before the
British nation will be properly sensible of how much of its greatness it
owes to the Browns. For centuries, in their quiet, dogged, homespun way,
they have been subduing the earth in most English counties, and leaving
their mark in American forests and Australian uplands. Wherever the
fleets and armies of England have won renown, there stalwart sons of the
Browns have done yeomen's work. With the yew bow and cloth-yard shaft at
Cressy and Agincourt--with the brown bill and pike under the brave
Lord Willoughby--with culverin and demi-culverin against Spaniards and
Dutchmen--with hand-grenade and sabre, and musket and bayonet, under
Rodney and St. Vincent, Wolfe and Moore, Nelson and Wellington, they
have carried their lives in their hands, getting hard knocks and hard
work in plenty--which was on the whole what they looked for, and the
best thing for them--and little praise or pudding, which indeed they,
and most of us, are better without. Talbots and Stanleys, St. Maurs,
and such-like folk, have led armies and made laws time out of mind; but
those noble families would be somewhat astounded--if the accounts ever
came to be fairly taken--to find how small their work for England has
been by the side of that of the Browns.

<p/>These latter, indeed, have, until the present generation, rarely been
sung by poet, or chronicled by sage. They have wanted their sacer vates,
having been too solid to rise to the top by themselves, and not having
been largely gifted with the talent of catching hold of, and holding on
tight to, whatever good things happened to be going--the foundation of
the fortunes of so many noble families. But the world goes on its way,
and the wheel turns, and the wrongs of the Browns, like other wrongs,
seem in a fair way to get righted. And this present writer, having for
many years of his (<font color='blue'><b>writer</b></font>) life been a devout Brown-worshipper, and, moreover,
having the honour of being nearly connected with an eminently
respectable branch of the great Brown family, is anxious, so far as in
him (<font color='blue'><b>Brown</b></font>) lies, to help the wheel over, and throw his (<font color='blue'><b>Brown</b></font>) stone on to the pile.

<p/>However, gentle reader, or simple reader, whichever you may be, lest you
should be led to waste your precious time upon these pages, I make so
bold as at once to tell you the sort of folk you'll have to meet and put
up with, if you and I are to jog on comfortably together. You shall hear
at once what sort of folk the Browns are--at least my branch of them;
and then, if you don't like the sort, why, cut the concern at once, and
let you and I cry quits before either of us can grumble at the other.

<p/>In the first place, the Browns are a fighting family. One may question
their wisdom, or wit, or beauty, but about their fight there can be no
question. Wherever hard knocks of any kind, visible or invisible, are
going; there the Brown who is nearest must shove in his (<font color='blue'><b>Brown</b></font>) carcass.
And these carcasses, for the most part, answer very well to the
characteristic propensity: they are a squareheaded and snake-necked
generation, broad in the shoulder, deep in the chest, and thin in
the flank, carrying no lumber. Then for clanship, they are as bad as
Highlanders; it is amazing the belief they have in one another.
With them there is nothing like the Browns, to the third and fourth
generation. <div class="bookquote">``Blood is thicker than water,''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>is one of their pet sayings.
They can't be happy unless they are always meeting one another. Never
were such people for family gatherings; which, were you a stranger, or
sensitive, you might think had better not have been gathered together.
For during the whole time of their being together they luxuriate in
telling one another their minds on whatever subject turns up; and their
minds are wonderfully antagonistic, and all their opinions are downright
beliefs. Till you've been among them some time and understand them, you
can't think but that they are quarrelling. Not a bit of it. They love
and respect one another ten times the more after a good set family
arguing bout, and go back, one to his (<font color='blue'><b>family</b></font>) curacy, another to his (<font color='blue'><b>family</b></font>) chambers,
and another to his (<font color='blue'><b>family</b></font>) regiment, freshened for work, and more than ever
convinced that the Browns are the height of company.

<p/>This family training, too, combined with their turn for combativeness,
makes them eminently quixotic. They can't let anything alone which they
think going wrong. They must speak their mind about it, annoying all
easy-going folk, and spend their time and money in having a tinker at
it, however hopeless the job. It is an impossibility to a Brown to leave
the most disreputable lame dog on the other side of a stile. Most other
folk get tired of such work. The old Browns, with red faces, white
whiskers, and bald heads, go on believing and fighting to a green old
age. They have always a crotchet going, till the old man with the scythe
reaps and garners them away for troublesome old boys as they are.

<p/>And the most provoking thing is, that no failures knock them up, or make
them hold their hands, or think you, or me, or other sane people in
the right. Failures slide off them like July rain off a duck's back
feathers. Jem and his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) whole family turn out bad, and cheat them one
week, and the next they are doing the same thing for Jack; and when he (<font color='blue'><b>Jack</b></font>)
goes to the treadmill, and his (<font color='blue'><b>Jack</b></font>) wife and children to the workhouse, they
will be on the lookout for Bill to take his (<font color='blue'><b>Bill</b></font>) place.

<p/>However, it is time for us to get from the general to the particular;
so, leaving the great army of Browns, who are scattered over the whole
empire on which the sun never sets, and whose general diffusion I take
to be the chief cause of that empire's stability; let us at once fix our
attention upon the small nest of Browns in which our hero was hatched,
and which dwelt in that portion of the royal county of Berks which is
called the Vale of White Horse.

<p/>Most of you have probably travelled down the Great Western Railway as
far as Swindon. Those of you who did so with their eyes open have been
aware, soon after leaving the Didcot station, of a fine range of chalk
hills running parallel with the railway on the left-hand side as you go
down, and distant some two or three miles, more or less, from the line.
The highest point in the range is the White Horse Hill, which you come
in front of just before you stop at the Shrivenham station. If you love
English scenery, and have a few hours to spare, you can't do better,
the next time you pass, than stop at the Farringdon Road or Shrivenham
station, and make your way to that highest point. And those who care for
the vague old stories that haunt country-sides all about England, will
not, if they are wise, be content with only a few hours' stay; for,
glorious as the view is, the neighbourhood is yet more interesting
for its relics of bygone times. I only know two English neighbourhoods
thoroughly, and in each, within a circle of five miles, there is enough
of interest and beauty to last any reasonable man his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) life. I believe
this to be the case almost throughout the country, but each has a
special attraction, and none can be richer than the one I am speaking of
and going to introduce you to very particularly, for on this subject I
must be prosy; so those that don't care for England in detail may skip
the chapter.

<p/>O young England! young England! you who are born into these racing
railroad times, when there's a Great Exhibition, or some monster sight,
every year, and you can get over a couple of thousand miles of ground
for three pound ten in a five-weeks' holiday, why don't you know more of
your own birthplaces? You're all in the ends of the earth, it seems to
me, as soon as you get your necks out of the educational collar, for
midsummer holidays, long vacations, or what not--going round Ireland,
with a return ticket, in a fortnight; dropping your copies of Tennyson
on the tops of Swiss mountains; or pulling down the Danube in Oxford
racing boats. And when you get home for a quiet fortnight, you turn the
steam off, and lie on your backs in the paternal garden, surrounded by
the last batch of books from Mudie's library, and half bored to death.
Well, well! I know it has its good side. You all patter French more or
less, and perhaps German; you have seen men and cities, no doubt, and
have your opinions, such as they are, about schools of painting, high
art, and all that; have seen the pictures of Dresden and the Louvre,
and know the taste of sour krout. All I say is, you don't know your own
lanes and woods and fields. Though you may be choke-full of science, not
one in twenty of you knows where to find the wood-sorrel, or bee-orchis,
which grow in the next wood, or on the down three miles off, or what the
bog-bean and wood-sage are good for. And as for the country legends,
the stories of the old gable-ended farmhouses, the place where the last
skirmish was fought in the civil wars, where the parish butts stood,
where the last highwayman turned to bay, where the last ghost was laid
by the parson, they're gone out of date altogether.

<p/>Now, in my time, when we got home by the old coach, which put us down at
the cross-roads with our boxes, the first day of the holidays, and had
been driven off by the family coachman, singing <div class="bookquote">``Dulce Domum''  (<font color='red'><b>the family coachman</b></font>)</div>at the top
of our voices, there we were, fixtures, till black Monday came round. We
had to cut out our own amusements within a walk or a ride of home. And
so we got to know all the country folk and their ways and songs and
stories by heart, and went over the fields and woods and hills, again
and again, till we made friends of them all. We were Berkshire, or
Gloucestershire, or Yorkshire boys; and you're young cosmopolites,
belonging to all countries and no countries. No doubt it's all right; I
dare say it is. This is the day of large views, and glorious humanity,
and all that; but I wish back-sword play hadn't gone out in the Vale of
White Horse, and that that confounded Great Western hadn't carried away
Alfred's Hill to make an embankment.

<p/>But to return to the said Vale of White Horse, the country in which the
first scenes of this true and interesting story are laid. As I said, the
Great Western now runs right through it, and it is a land of large, rich
pastures bounded by ox-fences, and covered with fine hedgerow timber,
with here and there a nice little gorse or spinney, where abideth poor
Charley, having no other cover to which to betake himself for miles and
miles, when pushed out some fine November morning by the old Berkshire.
Those who have been there, and well mounted, only know how he (<font color='blue'><b>Charley</b></font>) and the
stanch little pack who dash after him (<font color='blue'><b>Charley</b></font>)--heads high and sterns low, with
a breast-high scent--can consume the ground at such times. There being
little ploughland, and few woods, the Vale is only an average sporting
country, except for hunting. The villages are straggling, queer,
old-fashioned places, the houses being dropped down without the least
regularity, in nooks and out-of-the-way corners, by the sides of shadowy
lanes and footpaths, each with its patch of garden. They are built
chiefly of good gray stone, and thatched; though I see that within the
last year or two the red-brick cottages are multiplying, for the Vale is
beginning to manufacture largely both bricks and tiles. There are lots
of waste ground by the side of the roads in every village, amounting
often to village greens, where feed the pigs and ganders of the people;
and these roads are old-fashioned, homely roads, very dirty and badly
made, and hardly endurable in winter, but still pleasant jog-trot roads
running through the great pasture-lands, dotted here and there with
little clumps of thorns, where the sleek kine are feeding, with no fence
on either side of them, and a gate at the end of each field, which makes
you get out of your gig -LRB-if you keep one-RRB-, and gives you a chance of
looking about you every quarter of a mile.

<p/>One of the moralists whom we sat under in our youth--was it the great
Richard Swiveller, or Mr. Stiggins--says, <div class="bookquote">``We are born in a vale, and
must take the consequences of being found in such a situation.''  (<font color='red'><b>Mr.</b></font>)</div>These
consequences I, for one, am ready to encounter. I pity people who
weren't born in a vale. I don't mean a flat country; but a vale--that
is, a flat country bounded by hills. The having your hill always in view
if you choose to turn towards him (<font color='blue'><b>Mr.</b></font>)--that's the essence of a vale. There
he (<font color='blue'><b>Mr.</b></font>) is for ever in the distance, your friend and companion. You never
lose him (<font color='blue'><b>friend</b></font>) as you do in hilly districts.

<p/>And then what a hill is the White Horse Hill! There it stands right up
above all the rest, nine hundred feet above the sea, and the boldest,
bravest shape for a chalk hill that you ever saw. Let us go up to the
top of him (<font color='blue'><b>White</b></font>), and see what is to be found there. Ay, you may well wonder
and think it odd you never heard of this before; but wonder or not, as
you please, there are hundreds of such things lying about England, which
wiser folk than you know nothing of, and care nothing for. Yes, it's a
magnificent Roman camp, and no mistake, with gates and ditch and mounds,
all as complete as it was twenty years after the strong old rogues left
it. Here, right up on the highest point, from which they say you can see
eleven counties, they trenched round all the table-land, some twelve or
fourteen acres, as was their custom, for they couldn't bear anybody to
overlook them, and made their eyrie. The ground falls away rapidly on
all sides. Was there ever such turf in the whole world? You sink up to
your ankles at every step, and yet the spring of it is delicious. There
is always a breeze in the <div class="bookquote">``camp,''  (<font color='red'><b>the Romans</b></font>)</div>as it is called; and here it lies,
just as the Romans left it, except that cairn on the east side, left by
her (<font color='blue'><b>You</b></font>) Majesty's corps of sappers and miners the other day, when they and
the engineer officer had finished their sojourn there, and their surveys
for the ordnance map of Berkshire. It is altogether a place that you
won't forget, a place to open a man's soul, and make him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) prophesy, as
he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) looks down on that great Vale spread out as the garden of the Lord
before him (<font color='blue'><b>Lord</b></font>), and wave on wave of the mysterious downs behind, and to the
right and left the chalk hills running away into the distance, along
which he (<font color='blue'><b>Lord</b></font>) can trace for miles the old Roman road, <div class="bookquote">``the Ridgeway''  (<font color='red'><b>Roman</b></font>)</div>-LRB-<div class="bookquote">``the
Rudge,''  (<font color='red'><b>Roman</b></font>)</div>as the country folk call it-RRB-, keeping straight along the highest
back of the hills--such a place as Balak brought Balaam to, and told him (<font color='blue'><b>Roman</b></font>)
to prophesy against the people in the valley beneath. And he (<font color='blue'><b>Roman</b></font>) could not,
neither shall you, for they are a people of the Lord who abide there.

<p/>And now we leave the camp, and descend towards the west, and are on
the Ashdown. We are treading on heroes. It is sacred ground for
Englishmen--more sacred than all but one or two fields where their bones
lie whitening. For this is the actual place where our Alfred won his (<font color='blue'><b>Alfred</b></font>)
great battle, the battle of Ashdown -LRB-<div class="bookquote">``Aescendum''  (<font color='red'><b>Ashdown</b></font>)</div>in the chroniclers-RRB-,
which broke the Danish power, and made England a Christian land. The
Danes held the camp and the slope where we are standing--the whole crown
of the hill, in fact. <div class="bookquote">``The heathen had beforehand seized the higher
ground,''  (<font color='red'><b>Vale</b></font>)</div>as old Asser says, having wasted everything behind them from
London, and being just ready to burst down on the fair Vale, Alfred's
own birthplace and heritage. And up the heights came the Saxons, as
they did at the Alma. <div class="bookquote">``The Christians led up their line from the
lower ground. There stood also on that same spot a single thorn-tree,
marvellous stumpy -LRB-which we ourselves with our very own eyes have
seen-RRB-.''  (<font color='red'><b>the chronicler</b></font>)</div>Bless the old chronicler! Does he (<font color='blue'><b>Alfred</b></font>) think nobody ever saw the
<div class="bookquote">``single thorn-tree''  (<font color='red'><b>nobody</b></font>)</div>but himself? Why, there it stands to this very day,
just on the edge of the slope, and I saw it not three weeks since--an
old single thorn-tree, <div class="bookquote">``marvellous stumpy.''  (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div>At least, if it isn't the
same tree it ought to have been, for it's just in the place where the
battle must have been won or lost--<div class="bookquote">``around which, as I was saying, the
two lines of foemen came together in battle with a huge shout. And in
this place one of the two kings of the heathen and five of his (<font color='blue'><b>heathen</b></font>) earls
fell down and died, and many thousands of the heathen side in the same
place.''  (<font color='red'><b>the king</b></font>)</div>* After which crowning mercy, the pious king, that there might
never be wanting a sign and a memorial to the country-side, carved out
on the northern side of the chalk hill, under the camp, where it is
almost precipitous, the great Saxon White Horse, which he (<font color='blue'><b>White</b></font>) who will may
see from the railway, and which gives its name to the Vale, over which
it has looked these thousand years and more.

<p/>* <div class="bookquote">``Pagani editiorem Iocum praeoccupaverant. Christiani ab

unica spinosa arbor, brevis admodum -LRB-quam nos ipsi nostris
propriis oculis vidimus-RRB-. Circa quam ergo hostiles inter se

Recensuit Franciscus Wise. Oxford, 1722, p.23.

<p/>Right down below the White Horse is a curious deep and broad gully
called <div class="bookquote">``the Manger,''  (<font color='red'><b>White</b></font>)</div>into one side of which the hills fall with a series
of the most lovely sweeping curves, known as <div class="bookquote">``the Giant's Stairs.''  (<font color='red'><b>White</b></font>)</div>They
are not a bit like stairs, but I never saw anything like them anywhere
else, with their short green turf, and tender bluebells, and gossamer
and thistle-down gleaming in the sun and the sheep-paths running along
their sides like ruled lines.

<p/>The other side of the Manger is formed by the Dragon's Hill, a curious
little round self-confident fellow, thrown forward from the range,
utterly unlike everything round him (<font color='blue'><b>Hill</b></font>). On this hill some deliverer of
mankind--St. George, the country folk used to tell me--killed a dragon.
Whether it were St. George, I cannot say; but surely a dragon was killed
there, for you may see the marks yet where his (<font color='blue'><b>George</b></font>) blood ran down, and more
by token the place where it ran down is the easiest way up the hillside.

<p/>Passing along the Ridgeway to the west for about a mile, we come to a
little clump of young beech and firs, with a growth of thorn and privet
underwood. Here you may find nests of the strong down partridge and
peewit, but take care that the keeper isn't down upon you; and in the
middle of it is an old cromlech, a huge flat stone raised on seven or
eight others, and led up to by a path, with large single stones set up
on each side. This is Wayland Smith's cave, a place of classic fame now;
but as Sir Walter has touched it, I may as well let it alone, and refer
you to <div class="bookquote">``Kenilworth''  (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div>for the legend.

<p/>The thick, deep wood which you see in the hollow, about a mile off,
surrounds Ashdown Park, built by Inigo Jones. Four broad alleys are cut
through the wood from circumference to centre, and each leads to one
face of the house. The mystery of the downs hangs about house and wood,
as they stand there alone, so unlike all around, with the green slopes
studded with great stones just about this part, stretching away on all
sides. It was a wise Lord Craven, I think, who pitched his (<font color='blue'><b>Craven</b></font>) tent there.

<p/>Passing along the Ridgeway to the east, we soon come to cultivated land.
The downs, strictly so called, are no more. Lincolnshire farmers have
been imported, and the long, fresh slopes are sheep-walks no more, but
grow famous turnips and barley. One of these improvers lives over there
at the <div class="bookquote">``Seven Barrows''  (<font color='red'><b>these improvers</b></font>)</div>farm, another mystery of the great downs. There
are the barrows still, solemn and silent, like ships in the calm sea,
the sepulchres of some sons of men. But of whom? It is three miles from
the White Horse--too far for the slain of Ashdown to be buried there.
Who shall say what heroes are waiting there? But we must get down into
the Vale again, and so away by the Great Western Railway to town,
for time and the printer's devil press, and it is a terrible long and
slippery descent, and a shocking bad road. At the bottom, however, there
is a pleasant public; whereat we must really take a modest quencher, for
the down air is provocative of thirst. So we pull up under an old oak
which stands before the door.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``What is the name of your hill, landlord?''

<p/><div class="bookquote">``What queer names!''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>say we, sighing at the end of our draught, and

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Bean't queer at all, as I can see, sir,''  (<font color='red'><b>queer</b></font>)</div>says mine host, handing back

perforated with two or three queer holes, like petrified antediluvian

are more than ever puzzled, and drink our second glass of ale, wondering
what will come next. <div class="bookquote">``Like to hear un, sir?''  (<font color='red'><b>Toby/Toby Philpot</b></font>)</div>says mine host, setting

mouth to one of the ratholes. Something must come of it, if he (<font color='blue'><b>Philpot</b></font>) doesn't
burst. Good heavens! I hope he (<font color='blue'><b>Philpot</b></font>) has no apoplectic tendencies. Yes, here
it comes, sure enough, a gruesome sound between a moan and a roar, and
spreads itself away over the valley, and up the hillside, and into the
woods at the back of the house, a ghost-like, awful voice. <div class="bookquote">``Um do say,
sir,''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>says mine host, rising purple-faced, while the moan is still
coming out of the Stwun, <div class="bookquote">``as they used in old times to warn the

 (<font color='red'><b>boys</b></font>)</div><p/>And now, my boys, you whom I want to get for readers, have you had
enough? Will you give in at once, and say you're convinced, and let me
begin my story, or will you have more of it? Remember, I've only been
over a little bit of the hillside yet--what you could ride round easily
on your ponies in an hour. I'm only just come down into the Vale, by
Blowing Stone Hill; and if I once begin about the Vale, what's to stop
me? You'll have to hear all about Wantage, the birthplace of Alfred, and
Farringdon, which held out so long for Charles the First -LRB-the Vale was
near Oxford, and dreadfully malignant--full of Throgmortons, Puseys,
and Pyes, and such like; and their brawny retainers-RRB-. Did you ever read
Thomas Ingoldsby's <div class="bookquote">``Legend of Hamilton Tighe'' (<font color='red'><b>Thomas</b></font>)</div>? If you haven't, you ought
to have. Well, Farringdon is where he (<font color='blue'><b>Thomas</b></font>) lived, before he (<font color='blue'><b>Thomas</b></font>) went to sea;
his (<font color='blue'><b>Thomas</b></font>) real name was Hamden Pye, and the Pyes were the great folk at
Farringdon. Then there's Pusey. You've heard of the Pusey horn, which
King Canute gave to the Puseys of that day, and which the gallant old
squire, lately gone to his (<font color='blue'><b>squire</b></font>) rest -LRB-whom Berkshire freeholders turned out
of last Parliament, to their eternal disgrace, for voting according to
his (<font color='blue'><b>squire</b></font>) conscience-RRB-, used to bring out on high days, holidays, and bonfire
nights. And the splendid old cross church at Uffington, the Uffingas
town. How the whole countryside teems with Saxon names and memories!
And the old moated grange at Compton, nestled close under the hillside,
where twenty Marianas may have lived, with its bright water-lilies
in the moat, and its yew walk, <div class="bookquote">``the cloister walk,''  (<font color='red'><b>Compton</b></font>)</div>and its peerless
terraced gardens. There they all are, and twenty things beside, for
those who care about them, and have eyes. And these are the sort of
things you may find, I believe, every one of you, in any common English
country neighbourhood.

<p/>Will you look for them under your own noses, or will you not? Well,
well, I've done what I can to make you; and if you will go gadding over
half Europe now, every holidays, I can't help it. I was born and bred
a west-country man, thank God! a Wessex man, a citizen of the noblest
Saxon kingdom of Wessex, a regular <div class="bookquote">``Angular Saxon,''  (<font color='red'><b>Wessex</b></font>)</div>the very soul of me
adscriptus glebae. There's nothing like the old country-side for me,
and no music like the twang of the real old Saxon tongue, as one gets
it fresh from the veritable chaw in the White Horse Vale; and I say with
<div class="bookquote">``Gaarge Ridler,''  (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div>the old west-country yeoman,--

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Throo aall the waarld owld Gaarge would bwoast,
Commend me to merry owld England mwoast;
While vools gwoes prating vur and nigh,
We stwops at whum, my dog and I.''

 (<font color='red'><b>the yeoman</b></font>)</div><p/>Here, at any rate, lived and stopped at home Squire Brown, J.P. for the
county of Berks, in a village near the foot of the White Horse range.
And here he (<font color='blue'><b>White</b></font>) dealt out justice and mercy in a rough way, and begat sons
and daughters, and hunted the fox, and grumbled at the badness of
the roads and the times. And his (<font color='blue'><b>fox</b></font>) wife dealt out stockings, and calico
shirts, and smock frocks, and comforting drinks to the old folks with
the <div class="bookquote">``rheumatiz,''  (<font color='red'><b>the folks</b></font>)</div>and good counsel to all; and kept the coal and clothes'
clubs going, for yule-tide, when the bands of mummers came round,
dressed out in ribbons and coloured paper caps, and stamped round the
Squire's kitchen, repeating in true sing-song vernacular the legend of
St. George and his (<font color='blue'><b>George</b></font>) fight, and the ten-pound doctor, who plays his (<font color='blue'><b>George</b></font>)
part at healing the Saint--a relic, I believe, of the old Middle-age
mysteries. It was the first dramatic representation which greeted the
eyes of little Tom, who was brought down into the kitchen by his (<font color='blue'><b>Tom</b></font>) nurse
to witness it, at the mature age of three years. Tom was the eldest
child of his (<font color='blue'><b>Tom</b></font>) parents, and from his (<font color='blue'><b>Tom</b></font>) earliest babyhood exhibited the
family characteristics in great strength. He (<font color='blue'><b>Tom</b></font>) was a hearty, strong boy
from the first, given to fighting with and escaping from his (<font color='blue'><b>Tom</b></font>) nurse, and
fraternizing with all the village boys, with whom he (<font color='blue'><b>Tom</b></font>) made expeditions
all round the neighbourhood. And here, in the quiet old-fashioned
country village, under the shadow of the everlasting hills, Tom Brown
was reared, and never left it till he (<font color='blue'><b>Brown</b></font>) went first to school, when nearly
eight years of age, for in those days change of air twice a year was not
thought absolutely necessary for the health of all her (<font color='blue'><b>nurse</b></font>) Majesty's lieges.

<p/>I have been credibly informed, and am inclined to believe, that the
various boards of directors of railway companies, those gigantic jobbers
and bribers, while quarrelling about everything else, agreed together
some ten years back to buy up the learned profession of medicine, body
and soul. To this end they set apart several millions of money, which
they continually distribute judiciously among the doctors, stipulating
only this one thing, that they shall prescribe change of air to every
patient who can pay, or borrow money to pay, a railway fare, and see
their prescription carried out. If it be not for this, why is it that
none of us can be well at home for a year together? It wasn't so twenty
years ago, not a bit of it. The Browns didn't go out of the country once
in five years. A visit to Reading or Abingdon twice a year, at assizes
or quarter sessions, which the Squire made on his (<font color='blue'><b>Squire</b></font>) horse with a pair
of saddle-bags containing his (<font color='blue'><b>Squire</b></font>) wardrobe, a stay of a day or two at some
country neighbour's, or an expedition to a county ball or the yeomanry
review, made up the sum of the Brown locomotion in most years. A stray
Brown from some distant county dropped in every now and then; or from
Oxford, on grave nag, an old don, contemporary of the Squire; and were
looked upon by the Brown household and the villagers with the same sort
of feeling with which we now regard a man who has crossed the Rocky
Mountains, or launched a boat on the Great Lake in Central Africa. The
White Horse Vale, remember, was traversed by no great road--nothing but
country parish roads, and these very bad. Only one coach ran there, and
this one only from Wantage to London, so that the western part of the
Vale was without regular means of moving on, and certainly didn't
seem to want them. There was the canal, by the way, which supplied the
country-side with coal, and up and down which continually went the long
barges, with the big black men lounging by the side of the horses along
the towing-path, and the women in bright-coloured handkerchiefs standing
in the sterns steering. Standing I say, but you could never see whether
they were standing or sitting, all but their heads and shoulders being
out of sight in the cozy little cabins which occupied some eight feet of
the stern, and which Tom Brown pictured to himself as the most desirable
of residences. His (<font color='blue'><b>Brown</b></font>) nurse told him (<font color='blue'><b>Brown</b></font>) that those good-natured-looking women
were in the constant habit of enticing children into the barges, and
taking them up to London and selling them, which Tom wouldn't
believe, and which made him (<font color='blue'><b>Tom</b></font>) resolve as soon as possible to accept the
oft-proffered invitation of these sirens to <div class="bookquote">``young master''  (<font color='red'><b>him</b></font>)</div>to come in
and have a ride. But as yet the nurse was too much for Tom.

<p/>Yet why should I, after all, abuse the gadabout propensities of my
countrymen? We are a vagabond nation now, that's certain, for better
for worse. I am a vagabond; I have been away from home no less than five
distinct times in the last year. The Queen sets us the example: we are
moving on from top to bottom. Little dirty Jack, who abides in Clement's
Inn gateway, and blacks my boots for a penny, takes his (<font color='blue'><b>Jack</b></font>) month's
hop-picking every year as a matter of course. Why shouldn't he (<font color='blue'><b>Jack</b></font>)? I'm
delighted at it. I love vagabonds, only I prefer poor to rich ones.
Couriers and ladies'-maids, imperials and travelling carriages, are an
abomination unto me; I cannot away with them. But for dirty Jack, and
every good fellow who, in the words of the capital French song, moves
about,

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Comme le limacon,
Portant tout son bagage,
Ses meubles, sa maison,''

 (<font color='red'><b>every fellow meubles maison luck adventure supper chalets kraals</b></font>)</div><p/>on his (<font color='blue'><b>Jack</b></font>) own back, why, good luck to them, and many a merry roadside
adventure, and steaming supper in the chimney corners of roadside inns,
Swiss chalets, Hottentot kraals, or wherever else they like to go. So,
having succeeded in contradicting myself in my first chapter -LRB-which
gives me great hopes that you will all go on, and think me a good fellow
notwithstanding my crotchets-RRB-, I shall here shut up for the present,
and consider my ways; having resolved to <div class="bookquote">``sar' it out,''  (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div>as we say in the
Vale, <div class="bookquote">``holus bolus''  (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div>just as it comes, and then you'll probably get the
truth out of me.



<p/>CHAPTER II--THE <div class="bookquote">``VEAST.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``And the King commandeth and forbiddeth, that from
henceforth neither fairs nor markets be kept in Churchyards,
for the honour of the Church.'' (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>--STATUTES : 13 Edw. I. Stat.
II. cap. vi.

<p/>As that venerable and learned poet -LRB-whose voluminous works we all think
it the correct thing to admire and talk about, but don't read often-RRB-
most truly says, <div class="bookquote">``The child is father to the man;''  (<font color='red'><b>that poet</b></font>)</div>a fortiori,
therefore, he (<font color='blue'><b>poet</b></font>) must be father to the boy. So as we are going at any rate
to see Tom Brown through his (<font color='blue'><b>Brown</b></font>) boyhood, supposing we never get any farther
-LRB-which, if you show a proper sense of the value of this history, there
is no knowing but what we may-RRB-, let us have a look at the life and
environments of the child in the quiet country village to which we were
introduced in the last chapter.

<p/>Tom, as has been already said, was a robust and combative urchin, and at
the age of four began to struggle against the yoke and authority of his (<font color='blue'><b>Tom</b></font>)
nurse. That functionary was a good-hearted, tearful, scatter-brained
girl, lately taken by Tom's mother, Madam Brown, as she (<font color='blue'><b>Brown</b></font>) was called, from
the village school to be trained as nurserymaid. Madam Brown was a rare
trainer of servants, and spent herself freely in the profession; for
profession it was, and gave her (<font color='blue'><b>Brown</b></font>) more trouble by half than many people
take to earn a good income. Her (<font color='blue'><b>Brown</b></font>) servants were known and sought after for
miles round. Almost all the girls who attained a certain place in the
village school were taken by her (<font color='blue'><b>Brown</b></font>), one or two at a time, as housemaids,
laundrymaids, nurserymaids, or kitchenmaids, and after a year or two's
training were started in life amongst the neighbouring families, with
good principles and wardrobes. One of the results of this system was the
perpetual despair of Mrs. Brown's cook and own maid, who no sooner had
a notable girl made to their hands than missus was sure to find a good
place for her (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) and send her (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) off, taking in fresh importations from the
school. Another was, that the house was always full of young girls, with
clean, shining faces, who broke plates and scorched linen, but made an
atmosphere of cheerful, homely life about the place, good for every one
who came within its influence. Mrs. Brown loved young people, and in
fact human creatures in general, above plates and linen. They were more
like a lot of elder children than servants, and felt to her (<font color='blue'><b>Brown</b></font>) more as a
mother or aunt than as a mistress.

<p/>Tom's nurse was one who took in her (<font color='blue'><b>nurse</b></font>) instruction very slowly--she (<font color='blue'><b>nurse</b></font>) seemed
to have two left hands and no head; and so Mrs. Brown kept her (<font color='blue'><b>Brown</b></font>) on longer
than usual, that she (<font color='blue'><b>Brown</b></font>) might expend her (<font color='blue'><b>Brown</b></font>) awkwardness and forgetfulness upon
those who would not judge and punish her (<font color='blue'><b>Brown</b></font>) too strictly for them.

<p/>Charity Lamb was her (<font color='blue'><b>Brown</b></font>) name. It had been the immemorial habit of the
village to christen children either by Bible names, or by those of the
cardinal and other virtues; so that one was for ever hearing in the
village street or on the green, shrill sounds of <div class="bookquote">``Prudence! Prudence!
thee cum' out o' the gutter;''  (<font color='red'><b>the cardinal virtues</b></font>)</div>or, <div class="bookquote">``Mercy! drat the girl, what bist thee
a-doin' wi' little Faith?''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>and there were Ruths, Rachels, Keziahs,
in every corner. The same with the boys: they were Benjamins, Jacobs,
Noahs, Enochs. I suppose the custom has come down from Puritan times.
There it is, at any rate, very strong still in the Vale.

<p/>Well, from early morning till dewy eve, when she (<font color='blue'><b>children</b></font>) had it out of him (<font color='blue'><b>Jacobs</b></font>) in
the cold tub before putting him (<font color='blue'><b>Jacobs</b></font>) to bed, Charity and Tom were pitted
against one another. Physical power was as yet on the side of Charity,
but she (<font color='blue'><b>children</b></font>) hadn't a chance with him (<font color='blue'><b>Tom</b></font>) wherever headwork was wanted. This
war of independence began every morning before breakfast, when Charity
escorted her (<font color='blue'><b>children</b></font>) charge to a neighbouring farmhouse, which supplied the
Browns, and where, by his (<font color='blue'><b>Tom</b></font>) mother's wish, Master Tom went to drink whey
before breakfast. Tom had no sort of objection to whey, but he (<font color='blue'><b>Tom</b></font>) had a
decided liking for curds, which were forbidden as unwholesome; and there
was seldom a morning that he (<font color='blue'><b>Tom</b></font>) did not manage to secure a handful of hard
curds, in defiance of Charity and of the farmer's wife. The latter good
soul was a gaunt, angular woman, who, with an old black bonnet on the
top of her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) head, the strings dangling about her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) shoulders, and her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>)
gown tucked through her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) pocket-holes, went clattering about the dairy,
cheese-room, and yard, in high pattens. Charity was some sort of niece
of the old lady's, and was consequently free of the farmhouse and
garden, into which she (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) could not resist going for the purposes of gossip
and flirtation with the heir-apparent, who was a dawdling fellow, never
out at work as he (<font color='blue'><b>fellow</b></font>) ought to have been. The moment Charity had found her (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>)
cousin, or any other occupation, Tom would slip away; and in a minute
shrill cries would be heard from the dairy, <div class="bookquote">``Charity, Charity, thee lazy
huzzy, where bist?''  (<font color='red'><b>Tom/Brown/Tom Brown</b></font>)</div>and Tom would break cover, hands and mouth full of
curds, and take refuge on the shaky surface of the great muck reservoir
in the middle of the yard, disturbing the repose of the great pigs. Here
he (<font color='blue'><b>Tom</b></font>) was in safety, as no grown person could follow without getting over
their knees; and the luckless Charity, while her (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) aunt scolded her (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) from
the dairy door, for being <div class="bookquote">``allus hankering about arter our Willum,
instead of minding Master Tom,''  (<font color='red'><b>aunt</b></font>)</div>would descend from threats to coaxing,
to lure Tom out of the muck, which was rising over his (<font color='blue'><b>Tom</b></font>) shoes, and would
soon tell a tale on his (<font color='blue'><b>Tom</b></font>) stockings, for which she (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) would be sure to catch
it from missus's maid.

<p/>Tom had two abettors, in the shape of a couple of old boys, Noah and
Benjamin by name, who defended him (<font color='blue'><b>Benjamin</b></font>) from Charity, and expended much time
upon his (<font color='blue'><b>Benjamin</b></font>) education. They were both of them retired servants of former
generations of the Browns. Noah Crooke was a keen, dry old man of almost
ninety, but still able to totter about. He (<font color='blue'><b>Crooke</b></font>) talked to Tom quite as if he (<font color='blue'><b>Tom</b></font>)
were one of his (<font color='blue'><b>Tom</b></font>) own family, and indeed had long completely identified
the Browns with himself. In some remote age he (<font color='blue'><b>Tom</b></font>) had been the attendant
of a Miss Brown, and had conveyed her (<font color='blue'><b>Brown</b></font>) about the country on a pillion. He (<font color='blue'><b>Tom</b></font>)
had a little round picture of the identical gray horse, caparisoned
with the identical pillion, before which he (<font color='blue'><b>Tom</b></font>) used to do a sort of
fetish worship, and abuse turnpike-roads and carriages. He (<font color='blue'><b>Tom</b></font>) wore an old
full-bottomed wig, the gift of some dandy old Brown whom he (<font color='blue'><b>Brown</b></font>) had valeted
in the middle of last century, which habiliment Master Tom looked upon
with considerable respect, not to say fear; and indeed his (<font color='blue'><b>Tom</b></font>) whole feeling
towards Noah was strongly tainted with awe. And when the old gentleman
was gathered to his (<font color='blue'><b>gentleman</b></font>) fathers, Tom's lamentation over him (<font color='blue'><b>Tom</b></font>) was not
unaccompanied by a certain joy at having seen the last of the wig. <div class="bookquote">``Poor
old Noah, dead and gone,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>said he (<font color='blue'><b>Tom</b></font>); <div class="bookquote">``Tom Brown so sorry. Put him (<font color='blue'><b>Brown</b></font>) in the
coffin, wig and all.''

 (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div><p/>But old Benjy was young master's real delight and refuge. He (<font color='blue'><b>Tom</b></font>) was a
youth by the side of Noah, scarce seventy years old--a cheery, humorous,
kind-hearted old man, full of sixty years of Vale gossip, and of all
sorts of helpful ways for young and old, but above all for children.
It was he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) who bent the first pin with which Tom extracted his (<font color='blue'><b>Tom</b></font>) first
stickleback out of <div class="bookquote">``Pebbly Brook,''  (<font color='red'><b>Tom/Brown/Tom Brown</b></font>)</div>the little stream which ran through
the village. The first stickleback was a splendid fellow, with fabulous
red and blue gills. Tom kept him (<font color='blue'><b>Tom</b></font>) in a small basin till the day of his (<font color='blue'><b>Tom</b></font>)
death, and became a fisherman from that day. Within a month from the
taking of the first stickleback, Benjy had carried off our hero to
the canal, in defiance of Charity; and between them, after a whole
afternoon's popjoying, they had caught three or four small, coarse fish
and a perch, averaging perhaps two and a half ounces each, which Tom
bore home in rapture to his (<font color='blue'><b>Tom</b></font>) mother as a precious gift, and which she (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>)
received like a true mother with equal rapture, instructing the cook
nevertheless, in a private interview, not to prepare the same for the
Squire's dinner. Charity had appealed against old Benjy in the meantime,
representing the dangers of the canal banks; but Mrs. Brown, seeing the
boy's inaptitude for female guidance, had decided in Benjy's favour, and
from thenceforth the old man was Tom's dry nurse. And as they sat by the
canal watching their little green-and-white float, Benjy would instruct
him (<font color='blue'><b>Tom</b></font>) in the doings of deceased Browns. How his (<font color='blue'><b>Tom</b></font>) grandfather, in the early
days of the great war, when there was much distress and crime in the
Vale, and the magistrates had been threatened by the mob, had ridden in
with a big stick in his (<font color='blue'><b>Tom</b></font>) hand, and held the petty sessions by himself.
How his (<font color='blue'><b>Tom</b></font>) great-uncle, the rector, had encountered and laid the last
ghost, who had frightened the old women, male and female, of the
parish out of their senses, and who turned out to be the blacksmith's
apprentice disguised in drink and a white sheet. It was Benjy, too,
who saddled Tom's first pony, and instructed him (<font color='blue'><b>Tom</b></font>) in the mysteries of
horsemanship, teaching him (<font color='blue'><b>Tom</b></font>) to throw his (<font color='blue'><b>Tom</b></font>) weight back and keep his (<font color='blue'><b>Tom</b></font>) hand
low, and who stood chuckling outside the door of the girls' school when
Tom rode his (<font color='blue'><b>Tom</b></font>) little Shetland into the cottage and round the table, where
the old dame and her (<font color='blue'><b>blacksmith</b></font>) pupils were seated at their work.

<p/>Benjy himself was come of a family distinguished in the Vale for their
prowess in all athletic games. Some half-dozen of his (<font color='blue'><b>Tom</b></font>) brothers and
kinsmen had gone to the wars, of whom only one had survived to come
home, with a small pension, and three bullets in different parts of his (<font color='blue'><b>Tom</b></font>)
body; he (<font color='blue'><b>Tom</b></font>) had shared Benjy's cottage till his (<font color='blue'><b>Tom</b></font>) death, and had left him (<font color='blue'><b>Tom</b></font>) his (<font color='blue'><b>Tom</b></font>)
old dragoon's sword and pistol, which hung over the mantelpiece, flanked
by a pair of heavy single-sticks with which Benjy himself had won renown
long ago as an old gamester, against the picked men of Wiltshire and
Somersetshire, in many a good bout at the revels and pastimes of the
country-side. For he (<font color='blue'><b>Tom</b></font>) had been a famous back-swordman in his (<font color='blue'><b>Tom</b></font>) young days,
and a good wrestler at elbow and collar.

<p/>Back-swording and wrestling were the most serious holiday pursuits of
the Vale--those by which men attained fame--and each village had its
champion. I suppose that, on the whole, people were less worked then
than they are now; at any rate, they seemed to have more time and energy
for the old pastimes. The great times for back-swording came round once
a year in each village; at the feast. The Vale <div class="bookquote">``veasts''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>were not
the common statute feasts, but much more ancient business. They are
literally, so far as one can ascertain, feasts of the dedication--that
is, they were first established in the churchyard on the day on which
the village church was opened for public worship, which was on the wake
or festival of the patron saint, and have been held on the same day in
every year since that time.

<p/>There was no longer any remembrance of why the <div class="bookquote">``veast''  (<font color='red'><b>a character</b></font>)</div>had been
instituted, but nevertheless it had a pleasant and almost sacred
character of its own; for it was then that all the children of the
village, wherever they were scattered, tried to get home for a holiday
to visit their fathers and mothers and friends, bringing with them their
wages or some little gift from up the country for the old folk. Perhaps
for a day or two before, but at any rate on <div class="bookquote">``veast day''  (<font color='red'><b>men women</b></font>)</div>and the day
after, in our village, you might see strapping, healthy young men and
women from all parts of the country going round from house to house in
their best clothes, and finishing up with a call on Madam Brown,
whom they would consult as to putting out their earnings to the best
advantage, or how best to expend the same for the benefit of the old
folk. Every household, however poor, managed to raise a <div class="bookquote">``feast-cake''
 (<font color='red'><b>all comers</b></font>)</div>and a bottle of ginger or raisin wine, which stood on the cottage table
ready for all comers, and not unlikely to make them remember feast-time,
for feast-cake is very solid, and full of huge raisins. Moreover,
feast-time was the day of reconciliation for the parish. If Job Higgins
and Noah Freeman hadn't spoken for the last six months, their <div class="bookquote">``old
women''  (<font color='red'><b>Noah Freeman</b></font>)</div>would be sure to get it patched up by that day. And though there
was a good deal of drinking and low vice in the booths of an evening,
it was pretty well confined to those who would have been doing the like,
<div class="bookquote">``veast or no veast;''  (<font color='red'><b>Christian</b></font>)</div>and on the whole, the effect was humanising and
Christian. In fact, the only reason why this is not the case still is
that gentlefolk and farmers have taken to other amusements, and have, as
usual, forgotten the poor. They don't attend the feasts themselves, and
call them disreputable; whereupon the steadiest of the poor leave them
also, and they become what they are called. Class amusements, be
they for dukes or ploughboys, always become nuisances and curses to a
country. The true charm of cricket and hunting is that they are still
more or less sociable and universal; there's a place for every man who
will come and take his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) part.

<p/>No one in the village enjoyed the approach of <div class="bookquote">``veast day''  (<font color='red'><b>Tom/Brown/Tom Brown</b></font>)</div>more than Tom,
in the year in which he (<font color='blue'><b>Tom</b></font>) was taken under old Benjy's tutelage. The feast
was held in a large green field at the lower end of the village. The
road to Farringdon ran along one side of it, and the brook by the side
of the road; and above the brook was another large, gentle, sloping
pasture-land, with a footpath running down it from the churchyard; and
the old church, the originator of all the mirth, towered up with its
gray walls and lancet windows, overlooking and sanctioning the whole,
though its own share therein had been forgotten. At the point where the
footpath crossed the brook and road, and entered on the field where the
feast was held, was a long, low roadside inn; and on the opposite side
of the field was a large white thatched farmhouse, where dwelt an old
sporting farmer, a great promoter of the revels.

<p/>Past the old church, and down the footpath, pottered the old man and the
child hand-in-hand early on the afternoon of the day before the feast,
and wandered all round the ground, which was already being occupied
by the <div class="bookquote">``cheap Jacks,''  (<font color='red'><b>the child</b></font>)</div>with their green-covered carts and marvellous
assortment of wares; and the booths of more legitimate small traders,
with their tempting arrays of fairings and eatables; and penny
peep-shows and other shows, containing pink-eyed ladies, and dwarfs, and
boa-constrictors, and wild Indians. But the object of most interest to
Benjy, and of course to his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) pupil also, was the stage of rough planks
some four feet high, which was being put up by the village carpenter for
the back-swording and wrestling. And after surveying the whole tenderly,
old Benjy led his (<font color='blue'><b>carpenter</b></font>) charge away to the roadside inn, where he (<font color='blue'><b>carpenter</b></font>) ordered a
glass of ale and a long pipe for himself, and discussed these unwonted
luxuries on the bench outside in the soft autumn evening with mine
host, another old servant of the Browns, and speculated with him (<font color='blue'><b>servant</b></font>) on the
likelihood of a good show of old gamesters to contend for the morrow's
prizes, and told tales of the gallant bouts of forty years back, to
which Tom listened with all his (<font color='blue'><b>Tom</b></font>) ears and eyes.

<p/>But who shall tell the joy of the next morning, when the church bells
were ringing a merry peal, and old Benjy appeared in the servants' hall,
resplendent in a long blue coat and brass buttons, and a pair of old
yellow buckskins and top-boots which he (<font color='blue'><b>Tom</b></font>) had cleaned for and inherited
from Tom's grandfather, a stout thorn stick in his (<font color='blue'><b>Tom</b></font>) hand, and a nosegay
of pinks and lavender in his (<font color='blue'><b>Tom</b></font>) buttonhole, and led away Tom in his (<font color='blue'><b>Tom</b></font>) best
clothes, and two new shillings in his (<font color='blue'><b>Tom</b></font>) breeches-pockets? Those two, at
any rate, look like enjoying the day's revel.

<p/>They quicken their pace when they get into the churchyard, for already
they see the field thronged with country folk; the men in clean, white
smocks or velveteen or fustian coats, with rough plush waistcoats of
many colours, and the women in the beautiful, long scarlet cloak--the
usual out-door dress of west-country women in those days, and which
often descended in families from mother to daughter--or in new-fashioned
stuff shawls, which, if they would but believe it, don't become them
half so well. The air resounds with the pipe and tabor, and the drums
and trumpets of the showmen shouting at the doors of their caravans,
over which tremendous pictures of the wonders to be seen within hang
temptingly; while through all rises the shrill <div class="bookquote">``root-too-too-too''  (<font color='red'><b>the showmen</b></font>)</div>of Mr.
Punch, and the unceasing pan-pipe of his (<font color='blue'><b>Mr.</b></font>) satellite.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Lawk a' massey, Mr. Benjamin,''  (<font color='red'><b>woman</b></font>)</div>cries a stout, motherly woman in a red
cloak, as they enter the field, <div class="bookquote">``be that you? Well, I never! You do look
purely. And how's the Squire, and madam, and the family?''

 (<font color='red'><b>woman</b></font>)</div><p/>Benjy graciously shakes hands with the speaker, who has left our village
for some years, but has come over for <div class="bookquote">``veast''  (<font color='red'><b>the speaker</b></font>)</div>day on a visit to an old
gossip, and gently indicates the heir-apparent of the Browns.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Bless his (<font color='blue'><b>Benjamin</b></font>) little heart! I must gi' un a kiss.--Here, Susannah,
Susannah!''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>cries she (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>), raising herself from the embrace, <div class="bookquote">``come and see
Mr. Benjamin and young Master Tom.--You minds our Sukey, Mr. Benjamin;
she (<font color='blue'><b>Sukey</b></font>) be growed a rare slip of a wench since you seen her (<font color='blue'><b>Sukey</b></font>), though her (<font color='blue'><b>Sukey</b></font>)'ll
be sixteen come Martinmas. I do aim to take her (<font color='blue'><b>Sukey</b></font>) to see madam to get her (<font color='blue'><b>Sukey</b></font>)
a place.''

 (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div><p/>And Sukey comes bouncing away from a knot of old school-fellows, and
drops a curtsey to Mr. Benjamin. And elders come up from all parts to
salute Benjy, and girls who have been madam's pupils to kiss Master
Tom. And they carry him (<font color='blue'><b>Tom</b></font>) off to load him (<font color='blue'><b>Tom</b></font>) with fairings; and he (<font color='blue'><b>Tom</b></font>) returns
to Benjy, his (<font color='blue'><b>Tom</b></font>) hat and coat covered with ribbons, and his (<font color='blue'><b>Tom</b></font>) pockets crammed
with wonderful boxes which open upon ever new boxes, and popguns, and
trumpets, and apples, and gilt gingerbread from the stall of Angel
Heavens, sole vender thereof, whose booth groans with kings and queens,
and elephants and prancing steeds, all gleaming with gold. There
was more gold on Angel's cakes than there is ginger in those of
this degenerate age. Skilled diggers might yet make a fortune in the
churchyards of the Vale, by carefully washing the dust of the consumers
of Angel's gingerbread. Alas! he (<font color='blue'><b>Angel</b></font>) is with his (<font color='blue'><b>Angel</b></font>) namesakes, and his (<font color='blue'><b>Angel</b></font>) receipts
have, I fear, died with him (<font color='blue'><b>Angel</b></font>).

<p/>And then they inspect the penny peep-show--at least Tom does--while old
Benjy stands outside and gossips and walks up the steps, and enters the
mysterious doors of the pink-eyed lady and the Irish giant, who do not
by any means come up to their pictures; and the boa will not swallow his (<font color='blue'><b>Tom</b></font>)
rabbit, but there the rabbit is waiting to be swallowed; and what can
you expect for tuppence? We are easily pleased in the Vale. Now there
is a rush of the crowd, and a tinkling bell is heard, and shouts of
laughter; and Master Tom mounts on Benjy's shoulders, and beholds a
jingling match in all its glory. The games are begun, and this is the
opening of them. It is a quaint game, immensely amusing to look at;
and as I don't know whether it is used in your counties, I had better
describe it. A large roped ring is made, into which are introduced
a dozen or so of big boys and young men who mean to play; these are
carefully blinded and turned loose into the ring, and then a man is
introduced not blindfolded; with a bell hung round his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) neck, and his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) two
hands tied behind him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>). Of course every time he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) moves the bell must ring,
as he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) has no hand to hold it; and so the dozen blindfolded men have to
catch him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>). This they cannot always manage if he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) is a lively fellow, but
half of them always rush into the arms of the other half, or drive their
heads together, or tumble over; and then the crowd laughs vehemently,
and invents nicknames for them on the spur of the moment; and they, if
they be choleric, tear off the handkerchiefs which blind them, and not
unfrequently pitch into one another, each thinking that the other must
have run against him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) on purpose. It is great fun to look at a jingling
match certainly, and Tom shouts and jumps on old Benjy's shoulders at
the sight, until the old man feels weary, and shifts him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) to the strong
young shoulders of the groom, who has just got down to the fun.

<p/>And now, while they are climbing the pole in another part of the field,
and muzzling in a flour-tub in another, the old farmer whose house, as
has been said, overlooks the field, and who is master of the revels,
gets up the steps on to the stage, and announces to all whom it may
concern that a half-sovereign in money will be forthcoming to the old
gamester who breaks most heads; to which the Squire and he (<font color='blue'><b>Squire</b></font>) have added a
new hat.

<p/>The amount of the prize is sufficient to stimulate the men of the
immediate neighbourhood, but not enough to bring any very high talent
from a distance; so, after a glance or two round, a tall fellow, who is
a down shepherd, chucks his (<font color='blue'><b>fellow</b></font>) hat on to the stage and climbs up the steps,
looking rather sheepish. The crowd, of course, first cheer, and then
chaff as usual, as he (<font color='blue'><b>fellow</b></font>) picks up his (<font color='blue'><b>fellow</b></font>) hat and begins handling the sticks to
see which will suit him (<font color='blue'><b>fellow</b></font>).

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Wooy, Willum Smith, thee canst plaay wi' he (<font color='blue'><b>Smith</b></font>) arra daay,''  (<font color='red'><b>companion fellow</b></font>)</div>says his (<font color='blue'><b>fellow</b></font>)
companion to the blacksmith's apprentice, a stout young fellow of
nineteen or twenty. Willum's sweetheart is in the <div class="bookquote">``veast''  (<font color='red'><b>Willum sweetheart</b></font>)</div>somewhere, and
has strictly enjoined him (<font color='blue'><b>Willum</b></font>) not to get his (<font color='blue'><b>Willum</b></font>) head broke at back-swording, on
pain of her (<font color='blue'><b>sweetheart</b></font>) highest displeasure; but as she (<font color='blue'><b>sweetheart</b></font>) is not to be seen -LRB-the women
pretend not to like to see the backsword play, and keep away from the
stage-RRB-, and as his (<font color='blue'><b>Willum</b></font>) hat is decidedly getting old, he (<font color='blue'><b>Willum</b></font>) chucks it on to the
stage, and follows himself, hoping that he (<font color='blue'><b>Willum</b></font>) will only have to break other
people's heads, or that, after all, Rachel won't really mind.

<p/>Then follows the greasy cap lined with fur of a half-gipsy, poaching,
loafing fellow, who travels the Vale not for much good, I fancy:

<p/><div class="bookquote">``For twenty times was Peter feared
For once that Peter was respected,''

 (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div><p/>in fact. And then three or four other hats, including the glossy
castor of Joe Willis, the self-elected and would-be champion of
the neighbourhood, a well-to-do young butcher of twenty-eight or
thereabouts, and a great strapping fellow, with his (<font color='blue'><b>fellow</b></font>) full allowance of
bluster. This is a capital show of gamesters, considering the amount
of the prize; so, while they are picking their sticks and drawing their
lots, I think I must tell you, as shortly as I can, how the noble old
game of back-sword is played; for it is sadly gone out of late, even in
the Vale, and maybe you have never seen it.

<p/>The weapon is a good stout ash stick with a large basket handle, heavier
and somewhat shorter than a common single-stick. The players are called
<div class="bookquote">``old gamesters'' (<font color='red'><b>The players</b></font>)</div>--why, I can't tell you--and their object is simply
to break one another's heads; for the moment that blood runs an inch
anywhere above the eyebrow, the old gamester to whom it belongs is
beaten, and has to stop. A very slight blow with the sticks will fetch
blood, so that it is by no means a punishing pastime, if the men don't
play on purpose and savagely at the body and arms of their adversaries.
The old gamester going into action only takes off his (<font color='blue'><b>players</b></font>) hat and coat, and
arms himself with a stick; he (<font color='blue'><b>players</b></font>) then loops the fingers of his (<font color='blue'><b>players</b></font>) left hand in
a handkerchief or strap, which he (<font color='blue'><b>players</b></font>) fastens round his (<font color='blue'><b>players</b></font>) left leg, measuring
the length, so that when he (<font color='blue'><b>players</b></font>) draws it tight with his (<font color='blue'><b>players</b></font>) left elbow in the
air, that elbow shall just reach as high as his (<font color='blue'><b>players</b></font>) crown. Thus you see, so
long as he (<font color='blue'><b>players</b></font>) chooses to keep his (<font color='blue'><b>players</b></font>) left elbow up, regardless of cuts, he (<font color='blue'><b>players</b></font>)
has a perfect guard for the left side of his (<font color='blue'><b>players</b></font>) head. Then he (<font color='blue'><b>players</b></font>) advances his (<font color='blue'><b>players</b></font>)
right hand above and in front of his (<font color='blue'><b>players</b></font>) head, holding his (<font color='blue'><b>players</b></font>) stick across, so
that its point projects an inch or two over his (<font color='blue'><b>players</b></font>) left elbow; and thus
his (<font color='blue'><b>players</b></font>) whole head is completely guarded, and he (<font color='blue'><b>players</b></font>) faces his (<font color='blue'><b>players</b></font>) man armed in like
manner; and they stand some three feet apart, often nearer, and feint,
and strike, and return at one another's heads, until one cries <div class="bookquote">``hold,''
 (<font color='red'><b>man</b></font>)</div>or blood flows. In the first case they are allowed a minute's time; and
go on again; in the latter another pair of gamesters are called on. If
good men are playing, the quickness of the returns is marvellous: you
hear the rattle like that a boy makes drawing his (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>) stick along palings,
only heavier; and the closeness of the men in action to one another
gives it a strange interest, and makes a spell at back-swording a very
noble sight.

<p/>They are all suited now with sticks, and Joe Willis and the gipsy man
have drawn the first lot. So the rest lean against the rails of the
stage, and Joe and the dark man meet in the middle, the boards having
been strewed with sawdust, Joe's white shirt and spotless drab breeches
and boots contrasting with the gipsy's coarse blue shirt and dirty green
velveteen breeches and leather gaiters. Joe is evidently turning up his (<font color='blue'><b>Joe</b></font>)
nose at the other, and half insulted at having to break his (<font color='blue'><b>Joe</b></font>) head.

<p/>The gipsy is a tough, active fellow, but not very skilful with his (<font color='blue'><b>Joe</b></font>)
weapon, so that Joe's weight and strength tell in a minute; he (<font color='blue'><b>Joe</b></font>) is too
heavy metal for him (<font color='blue'><b>Joe</b></font>). Whack, whack, whack, come his (<font color='blue'><b>Joe</b></font>) blows, breaking down
the gipsy's guard, and threatening to reach his (<font color='blue'><b>Joe</b></font>) head every moment. There
it is at last. <div class="bookquote">``Blood, blood!''  (<font color='red'><b>the spectators</b></font>)</div>shout the spectators, as a thin stream
oozes out slowly from the roots of his (<font color='blue'><b>Joe</b></font>) hair, and the umpire calls to
them to stop. The gipsy scowls at Joe under his (<font color='blue'><b>Joe</b></font>) brows in no pleasant
manner, while Master Joe swaggers about, and makes attitudes, and thinks
himself, and shows that he (<font color='blue'><b>Joe</b></font>) thinks himself, the greatest man in the
field.

<p/>Then follow several stout sets-to between the other candidates for the
new hat, and at last come the shepherd and Willum Smith. This is the
crack set-to of the day. They are both in famous wind, and there is no
crying <div class="bookquote">``hold.''  (<font color='red'><b>The shepherd</b></font>)</div>The shepherd is an old hand, and up to all the dodges. He (<font color='blue'><b>shepherd</b></font>)
tries them one after another, and very nearly gets at Willum's head
by coming in near, and playing over his (<font color='blue'><b>Willum</b></font>) guard at the half-stick; but
somehow Willum blunders through, catching the stick on his (<font color='blue'><b>Willum</b></font>) shoulders,
neck, sides, every now and then, anywhere but on his (<font color='blue'><b>Willum</b></font>) head, and his (<font color='blue'><b>Willum</b></font>)
returns are heavy and straight, and he (<font color='blue'><b>Willum</b></font>) is the youngest gamester and a
favourite in the parish, and his (<font color='blue'><b>Willum</b></font>) gallant stand brings down shouts and
cheers, and the knowing ones think he (<font color='blue'><b>Willum</b></font>)'ll win if he (<font color='blue'><b>Willum</b></font>) keeps steady; and
Tom, on the groom's shoulder, holds his (<font color='blue'><b>Tom</b></font>) hands together, and can hardly
breathe for excitement.

<p/>Alas for Willum! His (<font color='blue'><b>Tom</b></font>) sweetheart, getting tired of female companionship,
has been hunting the booths to see where he (<font color='blue'><b>Tom</b></font>) can have got to, and now
catches sight of him (<font color='blue'><b>Tom</b></font>) on the stage in full combat. She (<font color='blue'><b>sweetheart</b></font>) flushes and turns
pale; her (<font color='blue'><b>sweetheart</b></font>) old aunt catches hold of her (<font color='blue'><b>sweetheart</b></font>), saying, <div class="bookquote">``Bless `ee, child,
doan't `ee go a’nigst it;''  (<font color='red'><b>her</b></font>)</div>but she (<font color='blue'><b>sweetheart</b></font>) breaks away and runs towards the
stage calling his (<font color='blue'><b>Tom</b></font>) name. Willum keeps up his (<font color='blue'><b>Willum</b></font>) guard stoutly, but glances
for a moment towards the voice. No guard will do it, Willum, without the
eye. The shepherd steps round and strikes, and the point of his (<font color='blue'><b>guard</b></font>) stick
just grazes Willum's forehead, fetching off the skin, and the blood
flows, and the umpire cries, <div class="bookquote">``Hold!''  (<font color='red'><b>the umpire</b></font>)</div>and poor Willum's chance is up for
the day. But he (<font color='blue'><b>Willum</b></font>) takes it very well, and puts on his (<font color='blue'><b>Willum</b></font>) old hat and coat,
and goes down to be scolded by his (<font color='blue'><b>Willum</b></font>) sweetheart, and led away out of
mischief. Tom hears him (<font color='blue'><b>Tom</b></font>) say coaxingly, as he (<font color='blue'><b>Tom</b></font>) walks off,--

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Now doan't `ee, Rachel! I wouldn't ha' done it, only I wanted summut
to buy `ee a fairing wi', and I be as vlush o' money as a twod o'
feathers.''

 (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Thee mind what I tells `ee,''  (<font color='red'><b>Rachel</b></font>)</div>rejoins Rachel saucily, <div class="bookquote">``and doan't `ee
kep blethering about fairings.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Rachel</b></font>)</div><p/>Tom resolves in his (<font color='blue'><b>Tom</b></font>) heart to give Willum the remainder of his (<font color='blue'><b>Willum</b></font>) two
shillings after the back-swording.

<p/>Joe Willis has all the luck to-day. His (<font color='blue'><b>Willis</b></font>) next bout ends in an easy
victory, while the shepherd has a tough job to break his (<font color='blue'><b>shepherd</b></font>) second head;
and when Joe and the shepherd meet, and the whole circle expect and hope
to see him (<font color='blue'><b>Joe</b></font>) get a broken crown, the shepherd slips in the first round and
falls against the rails, hurting himself so that the old farmer will not
let him (<font color='blue'><b>farmer</b></font>) go on, much as he (<font color='blue'><b>farmer</b></font>) wishes to try; and that impostor Joe -LRB-for he (<font color='blue'><b>Joe</b></font>)
is certainly not the best man-RRB- struts and swaggers about the stage the
conquering gamester, though he (<font color='blue'><b>Joe</b></font>) hasn't had five minutes' really trying
play.

<p/>Joe takes the new hat in his (<font color='blue'><b>Joe</b></font>) hand, and puts the money into it, and then,
as if a thought strikes him (<font color='blue'><b>Joe</b></font>), and he (<font color='blue'><b>Joe</b></font>) doesn't think his (<font color='blue'><b>Joe</b></font>) victory quite
acknowledged down below, walks to each face of the stage, and looks
down, shaking the money, and chaffing, as how he (<font color='blue'><b>Joe</b></font>)'ll stake hat and money
and another half-sovereign <div class="bookquote">``agin any gamester as hasn't played already.''
 (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>Cunning Joe! he (<font color='blue'><b>Joe</b></font>) thus gets rid of Willum and the shepherd, who is quite
fresh again.

<p/>No one seems to like the offer, and the umpire is just coming down,
when a queer old hat, something like a doctor of divinity's shovel, is
chucked on to the stage and an elderly, quiet man steps out, who has
been watching the play, saying he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) should like to cross a stick wi' the
prodigalish young chap.

<p/>The crowd cheer, and begin to chaff Joe, who turns up his (<font color='blue'><b>Joe</b></font>) nose and
swaggers across to the sticks. <div class="bookquote">``Imp'dent old wosbird!''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>says he (<font color='blue'><b>Joe</b></font>); <div class="bookquote">``I'll
break the bald head on un to the truth.''

 (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div><p/>The old boy is very bald, certainly, and the blood will show fast enough
if you can touch him (<font color='blue'><b>Joe</b></font>), Joe.

<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Joe</b></font>) takes off his (<font color='blue'><b>Joe</b></font>) long-flapped coat, and stands up in a long-flapped
waistcoat, which Sir Roger de Coverley might have worn when it was new,
picks out a stick, and is ready for Master Joe, who loses no time, but
begins his (<font color='blue'><b>Joe</b></font>) old game, whack, whack, whack, trying to break down the old
man's guard by sheer strength. But it won't do; he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) catches every blow
close by the basket, and though he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) is rather stiff in his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) returns,
after a minute walks Joe about the stage, and is clearly a stanch old
gamester. Joe now comes in, and making the most of his (<font color='blue'><b>Joe</b></font>) height, tries to
get over the old man's guard at half-stick, by which he (<font color='blue'><b>Joe</b></font>) takes a smart
blow in the ribs and another on the elbow, and nothing more. And now he (<font color='blue'><b>Joe</b></font>)
loses wind and begins to puff, and the crowd laugh. <div class="bookquote">``Cry `hold,' Joe;
thee'st met thy match!''  (<font color='red'><b>Joe/Joe Willis/Willis</b></font>)</div>Instead of taking good advice and getting his (<font color='blue'><b>Joe</b></font>)
wind, Joe loses his (<font color='blue'><b>Joe</b></font>) temper, and strikes at the old man's body.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Blood, blood!''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>shout the crowd; <div class="bookquote">``Joe's head's broke!''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/>Who'd have thought it? How did it come? That body-blow left Joe's head
unguarded for a moment; and with one turn of the wrist the old gentleman
has picked a neat little bit of skin off the middle of his (<font color='blue'><b>gentleman</b></font>) forehead; and
though he (<font color='blue'><b>gentleman</b></font>) won't believe it, and hammers on for three more blows despite
of the shouts, is then convinced by the blood trickling into his (<font color='blue'><b>gentleman</b></font>) eye.
Poor Joe is sadly crestfallen, and fumbles in his (<font color='blue'><b>Joe</b></font>) pocket for the other
half-sovereign, but the old gamester won't have it. <div class="bookquote">``Keep thy money,
man, and gi's thy hand,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>says he (<font color='blue'><b>Joe</b></font>); and they shake hands. But the old
gamester gives the new hat to the shepherd, and, soon after, the
half-sovereign to Willum, who thereout decorates his (<font color='blue'><b>Willum</b></font>) sweetheart with
ribbons to his (<font color='blue'><b>Willum</b></font>) heart's content.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Who can a be?''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``Wur do a cum from?''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>ask the crowd. And it soon flies
about that the old west-country champion, who played a tie with Shaw the
Lifeguardsman at <div class="bookquote">``Vizes''  (<font color='red'><b>Shaw</b></font>)</div>twenty years before, has broken Joe Willis's
crown for him (<font color='blue'><b>Willis</b></font>).

<p/>How my country fair is spinning out! I see I must skip the wrestling;
and the boys jumping in sacks, and rolling wheelbarrows blindfolded;
and the donkey-race, and the fight which arose thereout, marring the
otherwise peaceful <div class="bookquote">``veast;''  (<font color='red'><b>the boys</b></font>)</div>and the frightened scurrying away of the
female feast-goers, and descent of Squire Brown, summoned by the wife of
one of the combatants to stop it; which he (<font color='blue'><b>Brown</b></font>) wouldn't start to do till he (<font color='blue'><b>Brown</b></font>)
had got on his (<font color='blue'><b>Brown</b></font>) top-boots. Tom is carried away by old Benjy, dog-tired
and surfeited with pleasure, as the evening comes on and the dancing
begins in the booths; and though Willum, and Rachel in her (<font color='blue'><b>Rachel</b></font>) new ribbons,
and many another good lad and lass don't come away just yet, but have
a good step out, and enjoy it, and get no harm thereby, yet we, being
sober folk, will just stroll away up through the churchyard, and by the
old yew-tree, and get a quiet dish of tea and a parley with our gossips,
as the steady ones of our village do, and so to bed.

<p/>That's the fair, true sketch, as far as it goes, of one of the larger
village feasts in the Vale of Berks, when I was a little boy. They
are much altered for the worse, I am told. I haven't been at one these
twenty years, but I have been at the statute fairs in some west-country
towns, where servants are hired, and greater abominations cannot be
found. What village feasts have come to, I fear, in many cases, may
be read in the pages of <div class="bookquote">``Yeast''  (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div>-LRB-though I never saw one so bad--thank
God!-RRB-.

<p/>Do you want to know why? It is because, as I said before, gentlefolk and
farmers have left off joining or taking an interest in them. They don't
either subscribe to the prizes, or go down and enjoy the fun.

<p/>Is this a good or a bad sign? I hardly know. Bad, sure enough, if it
only arises from the further separation of classes consequent on twenty
years of buying cheap and selling dear, and its accompanying overwork;
or because our sons and daughters have their hearts in London club-life,
or so-called <div class="bookquote">``society,''  (<font color='red'><b>daughters</b></font>)</div>instead of in the old English home-duties;
because farmers' sons are apeing fine gentlemen, and farmers' daughters
caring more to make bad foreign music than good English cheeses. Good,
perhaps, if it be that the time for the old <div class="bookquote">``veast''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>has gone by; that
it is no longer the healthy, sound expression of English country
holiday-making; that, in fact, we, as a nation, have got beyond it,
and are in a transition state, feeling for and soon likely to find some
better substitute.

<p/>Only I have just got this to say before I quit the text. Don't let
reformers of any sort think that they are going really to lay hold of
the working boys and young men of England by any educational grapnel
whatever, which isn't some bona fide equivalent for the games of the
old country <div class="bookquote">``veast''  (<font color='red'><b>men</b></font>)</div>in it; something to put in the place of the
back-swording and wrestling and racing; something to try the muscles
of men's bodies, and the endurance of their hearts, and to make them
rejoice in their strength. In all the new-fangled comprehensive plans
which I see, this is all left out; and the consequence is, that your
great mechanics' institutes end in intellectual priggism, and your
Christian young men's societies in religious Pharisaism.

<p/>Well, well, we must bide our time. Life isn't all beer and skittles;
but beer and skittles, or something better of the same sort, must form
a good part of every Englishman's education. If I could only drive this
into the heads of you rising parliamentary lords, and young swells
who <div class="bookquote">``have your ways made for you,''  (<font color='red'><b>lords</b></font>)</div>as the saying is, you, who frequent
palaver houses and West-end clubs, waiting always ready to strap
yourselves on to the back of poor dear old John, as soon as the present
used-up lot -LRB-your fathers and uncles-RRB-, who sit there on the great
parliamentary-majorities' pack-saddle, and make believe they're guiding
him (<font color='blue'><b>John</b></font>) with their red-tape bridle, tumble, or have to be lifted off!

<p/>I don't think much of you yet--I wish I could--though you do go talking
and lecturing up and down the country to crowded audiences, and are
busy with all sorts of philanthropic intellectualism, and circulating
libraries and museums, and Heaven only knows what besides, and try to
make us think, through newspaper reports, that you are, even as we, of
the working classes. But bless your hearts, we <div class="bookquote">``ain't so green,''  (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div>though
lots of us of all sorts toady you enough certainly, and try to make you
think so.

<p/>I'll tell you what to do now: instead of all this trumpeting and fuss,
which is only the old parliamentary-majority dodge over again, just you
go, each of you -LRB-you've plenty of time for it, if you'll only give
up t'other line-RRB-, and quietly make three or four friends--real
friends--among us. You'll find a little trouble in getting at the right
sort, because such birds don't come lightly to your lure; but found
they may be. Take, say, two out of the professions, lawyer, parson,
doctor--which you will; one out of trade; and three or four out of the
working classes--tailors, engineers, carpenters, engravers. There's
plenty of choice. Let them be men of your own ages, mind, and ask
them to your homes; introduce them to your wives and sisters, and get
introduced to theirs; give them good dinners, and talk to them about
what is really at the bottom of your hearts; and box, and run, and row
with them, when you have a chance. Do all this honestly as man to
man, and by the time you come to ride old John, you'll be able to do
something more than sit on his (<font color='blue'><b>John</b></font>) back, and may feel his (<font color='blue'><b>John</b></font>) mouth with some
stronger bridle than a red-tape one.

<p/>Ah, if you only would! But you have got too far out of the right rut, I
fear. Too much over-civilization, and the deceitfulness of riches. It is
easier for a camel to go through the eye of a needle. More's the pity. I
never came across but two of you who could value a man wholly and solely
for what was in him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>)--who thought themselves verily and indeed of the
same flesh and blood as John Jones the attorney's clerk, and Bill Smith
the costermonger, and could act as if they thought so.



<p/>CHAPTER III--SUNDRY WARS AND ALLIANCES.


<p/>Poor old Benjy! The <div class="bookquote">``rheumatiz''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>has much to answer for all through
English country-sides, but it never played a scurvier trick than in
laying thee by the heels, when thou wast yet in a green old age. The
enemy, which had long been carrying on a sort of border warfare, and
trying his (<font color='blue'><b>Smith</b></font>) strength against Benjy's on the battlefield of his (<font color='blue'><b>Smith</b></font>) hands and
legs, now, mustering all his (<font color='blue'><b>Smith</b></font>) forces, began laying siege to the citadel,
and overrunning the whole country. Benjy was seized in the back and
loins; and though he (<font color='blue'><b>Smith</b></font>) made strong and brave fight, it was soon clear
enough that all which could be beaten of poor old Benjy would have to
give in before long.

<p/>It was as much as he (<font color='blue'><b>Smith</b></font>) could do now, with the help of his (<font color='blue'><b>Smith</b></font>) big stick and
frequent stops, to hobble down to the canal with Master Tom, and bait
his (<font color='blue'><b>Tom</b></font>) hook for him (<font color='blue'><b>Tom</b></font>), and sit and watch his (<font color='blue'><b>Tom</b></font>) angling, telling him (<font color='blue'><b>Tom</b></font>) quaint old
country stories; and when Tom had no sport, and detecting a rat some
hundred yards or so off along the bank, would rush off with Toby the
turnspit terrier, his (<font color='blue'><b>Toby</b></font>) other faithful companion, in bootless pursuit, he (<font color='blue'><b>Toby</b></font>)
might have tumbled in and been drowned twenty times over before Benjy
could have got near him (<font color='blue'><b>Toby</b></font>).

<p/>Cheery and unmindful of himself, as Benjy was, this loss of locomotive
power bothered him (<font color='blue'><b>Toby</b></font>) greatly. He (<font color='blue'><b>Toby</b></font>) had got a new object in his (<font color='blue'><b>Toby</b></font>) old age, and
was just beginning to think himself useful again in the world. He (<font color='blue'><b>Toby</b></font>) feared
much, too, lest Master Tom should fall back again into the hands of
Charity and the women. So he (<font color='blue'><b>Tom</b></font>) tried everything he (<font color='blue'><b>Tom</b></font>) could think of to get
set up. He (<font color='blue'><b>Tom</b></font>) even went an expedition to the dwelling of one of those queer
mortals, who--say what we will, and reason how we will--do cure simple
people of diseases of one kind or another without the aid of physic,
and so get to themselves the reputation of using charms, and inspire for
themselves and their dwellings great respect, not to say fear, amongst a
simple folk such as the dwellers in the Vale of White Horse. Where this
power, or whatever else it may be, descends upon the shoulders of a
man whose ways are not straight, he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) becomes a nuisance to the
neighbourhood--a receiver of stolen goods, giver of love-potions, and
deceiver of silly women--the avowed enemy of law and order, of justices
of the peace, head-boroughs, and gamekeepers,--such a man, in fact, as
was recently caught tripping, and deservedly dealt with by the Leeds
justices, for seducing a girl who had come to him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) to get back a
faithless lover, and has been convicted of bigamy since then. Sometimes,
however, they are of quite a different stamp--men who pretend to
nothing, and are with difficulty persuaded to exercise their occult arts
in the simplest cases.

<p/>Of this latter sort was old Farmer Ives, as he (<font color='blue'><b>Ives</b></font>) was called, the <div class="bookquote">``wise
man''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>to whom Benjy resorted -LRB-taking Tom with him (<font color='blue'><b>Tom</b></font>) as usual-RRB-, in the early
spring of the year next after the feast described in the last chapter.
Why he (<font color='blue'><b>Tom</b></font>) was called <div class="bookquote">``farmer''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>I cannot say, unless it be that he (<font color='blue'><b>Tom</b></font>) was the
owner of a cow, a pig or two, and some poultry, which he (<font color='blue'><b>Tom</b></font>) maintained
on about an acre of land inclosed from the middle of a wild common, on
which probably his (<font color='blue'><b>Tom</b></font>) father had squatted before lords of manors looked as
keenly after their rights as they do now. Here he (<font color='blue'><b>Tom</b></font>) had lived no one knew
how long, a solitary man. It was often rumoured that he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) was to be turned
out and his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) cottage pulled down, but somehow it never came to pass; and
his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) pigs and cow went grazing on the common, and his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) geese hissed at the
passing children and at the heels of the horse of my lord's steward, who
often rode by with a covetous eye on the inclosure still unmolested. His (<font color='blue'><b>steward</b></font>)
dwelling was some miles from our village; so Benjy, who was half ashamed
of his (<font color='blue'><b>steward</b></font>) errand, and wholly unable to walk there, had to exercise much
ingenuity to get the means of transporting himself and Tom thither
without exciting suspicion. However, one fine May morning he (<font color='blue'><b>Tom</b></font>) managed to
borrow the old blind pony of our friend the publican, and Tom persuaded
Madam Brown to give him (<font color='blue'><b>Tom</b></font>) a holiday to spend with old Benjy, and to lend
them the Squire's light cart, stored with bread and cold meat and a
bottle of ale. And so the two in high glee started behind old Dobbin,
and jogged along the deep-rutted plashy roads, which had not been mended
after their winter's wear, towards the dwelling of the wizard. About
noon they passed the gate which opened on to the large common, and old
Dobbin toiled slowly up the hill, while Benjy pointed out a little deep
dingle on the left, out of which welled a tiny stream. As they crept
up the hill the tops of a few birch-trees came in sight, and blue smoke
curling up through their delicate light boughs; and then the little
white thatched home and inclosed ground of Farmer Ives, lying cradled in
the dingle, with the gay gorse common rising behind and on both sides;
while in front, after traversing a gentle slope, the eye might travel
for miles and miles over the rich vale. They now left the main road and
struck into a green track over the common marked lightly with wheel and
horse-shoe, which led down into the dingle and stopped at the rough gate
of Farmer Ives. Here they found the farmer, an iron-gray old man, with a
bushy eyebrow and strong aquiline nose, busied in one of his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) vocations.
He (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) was a horse and cow doctor, and was tending a sick beast which had
been sent up to be cured. Benjy hailed him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) as an old friend, and he (<font color='blue'><b>friend</b></font>)
returned the greeting cordially enough, looking however hard for a
moment both at Benjy and Tom, to see whether there was more in their
visit than appeared at first sight. It was a work of some difficulty and
danger for Benjy to reach the ground, which, however, he (<font color='blue'><b>Tom</b></font>) managed to do
without mishap; and then he (<font color='blue'><b>Tom</b></font>) devoted himself to unharnessing Dobbin and
turning him (<font color='blue'><b>Dobbin</b></font>) out for a graze -LRB-<div class="bookquote">``a run''  (<font color='red'><b>him</b></font>)</div>one could not say of that virtuous
steed-RRB- on the common. This done, he (<font color='blue'><b>Dobbin</b></font>) extricated the cold provisions from
the cart, and they entered the farmer's wicket; and he (<font color='blue'><b>farmer</b></font>), shutting up the
knife with which he (<font color='blue'><b>farmer</b></font>) was taking maggots out of the cow's back and sides,
accompanied them towards the cottage. A big old lurcher got up slowly
from the door-stone, stretching first one hind leg and then the other,
and taking Tom's caresses and the presence of Toby, who kept, however,
at a respectful distance, with equal indifference.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Us be cum to pay `ee a visit. I've a been long minded to do't for old
sake's sake, only I vinds I dwon't get about now as I'd used to't. I be
so plaguy bad wi' th' rheumatiz in my back.''  (<font color='red'><b>Benjy</b></font>)</div>Benjy paused, in hopes
of drawing the farmer at once on the subject of his (<font color='blue'><b>farmer</b></font>) ailments without
further direct application.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Ah, I see as you bean't quite so lissom as you was,''  (<font color='red'><b>the farmer</b></font>)</div>replied the
farmer, with a grim smile, as he (<font color='blue'><b>farmer</b></font>) lifted the latch of his (<font color='blue'><b>farmer</b></font>) door; <div class="bookquote">``we
bean't so young as we was, nother on us, wuss luck.''

 (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div><p/>The farmer's cottage was very like those of the better class of
peasantry in general. A snug chimney corner with two seats, and a small
carpet on the hearth, an old flint gun and a pair of spurs over the
fireplace, a dresser with shelves on which some bright pewter plates
and crockeryware were arranged, an old walnut table, a few chairs and
settles, some framed samplers, and an old print or two, and a bookcase
with some dozen volumes on the walls, a rack with flitches of bacon, and
other stores fastened to the ceiling, and you have the best part of the
furniture. No sign of occult art is to be seen, unless the bundles of
dried herbs hanging to the rack and in the ingle and the row of labelled
phials on one of the shelves betoken it.

<p/>Tom played about with some kittens who occupied the hearth, and with a
goat who walked demurely in at the open door--while their host and Benjy
spread the table for dinner--and was soon engaged in conflict with the
cold meat, to which he (<font color='blue'><b>Tom</b></font>) did much honour. The two old men's talk was of
old comrades and their deeds, mute inglorious Miltons of the Vale, and
of the doings thirty years back, which didn't interest him (<font color='blue'><b>Tom</b></font>) much, except
when they spoke of the making of the canal; and then indeed he (<font color='blue'><b>Tom</b></font>) began to
listen with all his (<font color='blue'><b>Tom</b></font>) ears, and learned, to his (<font color='blue'><b>Tom</b></font>) no small wonder, that his (<font color='blue'><b>Tom</b></font>)
dear and wonderful canal had not been there always--was not, in fact,
so old as Benjy or Farmer Ives, which caused a strange commotion in his (<font color='blue'><b>Farmer</b></font>)
small brain.

<p/>After dinner Benjy called attention to a wart which Tom had on the
knuckles of his (<font color='blue'><b>Tom</b></font>) hand, and which the family doctor had been trying his (<font color='blue'><b>doctor</b></font>)
skill on without success, and begged the farmer to charm it away. Farmer
Ives looked at it, muttered something or another over it, and cut
some notches in a short stick, which he (<font color='blue'><b>Ives</b></font>) handed to Benjy, giving him (<font color='blue'><b>Ives</b></font>)
instructions for cutting it down on certain days, and cautioning Tom not
to meddle with the wart for a fortnight. And then they strolled out and
sat on a bench in the sun with their pipes, and the pigs came up and
grunted sociably and let Tom scratch them; and the farmer, seeing how he (<font color='blue'><b>farmer</b></font>)
liked animals, stood up and held his (<font color='blue'><b>farmer</b></font>) arms in the air, and gave a call,
which brought a flock of pigeons wheeling and dashing through the
birch-trees. They settled down in clusters on the farmer's arms and
shoulders, making love to him (<font color='blue'><b>farmer</b></font>) and scrambling over one another's backs
to get to his (<font color='blue'><b>farmer</b></font>) face; and then he (<font color='blue'><b>farmer</b></font>) threw them all off, and they fluttered
about close by, and lighted on him (<font color='blue'><b>farmer</b></font>) again and again when he (<font color='blue'><b>farmer</b></font>) held up his (<font color='blue'><b>farmer</b></font>)
arms. All the creatures about the place were clean and fearless, quite
unlike their relations elsewhere; and Tom begged to be taught how to
make all the pigs and cows and poultry in our village tame, at which the
farmer only gave one of his (<font color='blue'><b>farmer</b></font>) grim chuckles.

<p/>It wasn't till they were just ready to go, and old Dobbin was harnessed,
that Benjy broached the subject of his (<font color='blue'><b>Dobbin</b></font>) rheumatism again, detailing his (<font color='blue'><b>Dobbin</b></font>)
symptoms one by one. Poor old boy! He (<font color='blue'><b>Dobbin</b></font>) hoped the farmer could charm it
away as easily as he (<font color='blue'><b>farmer</b></font>) could Tom's wart, and was ready with equal faith to
put another notched stick into his (<font color='blue'><b>Tom</b></font>) other pocket, for the cure of his (<font color='blue'><b>Tom</b></font>)
own ailments. The physician shook his (<font color='blue'><b>Tom</b></font>) head, but nevertheless produced a
bottle, and handed it to Benjy, with instructions for use. <div class="bookquote">``Not as `t'll
do `ee much good--leastways I be afeard not,''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>shading his (<font color='blue'><b>Tom</b></font>) eyes with his (<font color='blue'><b>Tom</b></font>)
hand, and looking up at them in the cart. <div class="bookquote">``There's only one thing as I
knows on as'll cure old folks like you and I o' th' rheumatiz.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Wot be that then, farmer?''  (<font color='red'><b>Benjy</b></font>)</div>inquired Benjy.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Churchyard mould,''  (<font color='red'><b>the man</b></font>)</div>said the old iron-gray man, with another chuckle.
And so they said their good-byes and went their ways home. Tom's wart
was gone in a fortnight, but not so Benjy's rheumatism, which laid him (<font color='blue'><b>Tom</b></font>)
by the heels more and more. And though Tom still spent many an hour with
him (<font color='blue'><b>Tom</b></font>), as he (<font color='blue'><b>Tom</b></font>) sat on a bench in the sunshine, or by the chimney corner when
it was cold, he (<font color='blue'><b>Tom</b></font>) soon had to seek elsewhere for his (<font color='blue'><b>Tom</b></font>) regular companions.

<p/>Tom had been accustomed often to accompany his (<font color='blue'><b>Tom</b></font>) mother in her (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) visits to
the cottages, and had thereby made acquaintance with many of the village
boys of his (<font color='blue'><b>Tom</b></font>) own age. There was Job Rudkin, son of widow Rudkin, the most
bustling woman in the parish. How she (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) could ever have had such a stolid
boy as Job for a child must always remain a mystery. The first time
Tom went to their cottage with his (<font color='blue'><b>Tom</b></font>) mother, Job was not indoors; but he (<font color='blue'><b>Tom</b></font>)
entered soon after, and stood with both hands in his (<font color='blue'><b>Tom</b></font>) pockets, staring
at Tom. Widow Rudkin, who would have had to cross madam to get at
young Hopeful--a breach of good manners of which she (<font color='blue'><b>Widow</b></font>) was wholly
incapable--began a series of pantomime signs, which only puzzled him (<font color='blue'><b>Tom</b></font>);
and at last, unable to contain herself longer, burst out with, <div class="bookquote">``Job!
Job! where's thy cap?''

 (<font color='red'><b>him</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``What! bean't `ee on ma head, mother?''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>replied Job, slowly extricating
one hand from a pocket, and feeling for the article in question; which
he (<font color='blue'><b>Tom</b></font>) found on his (<font color='blue'><b>Tom</b></font>) head sure enough, and left there, to his (<font color='blue'><b>Tom</b></font>) mother's horror
and Tom's great delight.

<p/>Then there was poor Jacob Dodson, the half-witted boy, who ambled about
cheerfully, undertaking messages and little helpful odds and ends for
every one, which, however, poor Jacob managed always hopelessly to
imbrangle. Everything came to pieces in his (<font color='blue'><b>Jacob</b></font>) hands, and nothing would
stop in his (<font color='blue'><b>Jacob</b></font>) head. They nicknamed him (<font color='blue'><b>Jacob</b></font>) Jacob Doodle-calf.

<p/>But above all there was Harry Winburn, the quickest and best boy in the
parish. He (<font color='blue'><b>Winburn</b></font>) might be a year older than Tom, but was very little bigger,
and he (<font color='blue'><b>Tom</b></font>) was the Crichton of our village boys. He (<font color='blue'><b>Tom</b></font>) could wrestle and climb
and run better than all the rest, and learned all that the schoolmaster
could teach him (<font color='blue'><b>Tom</b></font>) faster than that worthy at all liked. He (<font color='blue'><b>Tom</b></font>) was a boy to
be proud of, with his (<font color='blue'><b>Tom</b></font>) curly brown hair, keen gray eye, straight active
figure, and little ears and hands and feet, <div class="bookquote">``as fine as a lord's,''  (<font color='red'><b>a boy eye figure ears hands feet</b></font>)</div>as
Charity remarked to Tom one day, talking, as usual, great nonsense.
Lords' hands and ears and feet are just as ugly as other folk's when
they are children, as any one may convince himself if he (<font color='blue'><b>Tom</b></font>) likes to look.
Tight boots and gloves, and doing nothing with them, I allow make a
difference by the time they are twenty.

<p/>Now that Benjy was laid on the shelf, and his (<font color='blue'><b>Tom</b></font>) young brothers were still
under petticoat government, Tom, in search of companions, began to
cultivate the village boys generally more and more. Squire Brown, be it
said, was a true-blue Tory to the backbone, and believed honestly that
the powers which be were ordained of God, and that loyalty and steadfast
obedience were men's first duties. Whether it were in consequence or in
spite of his (<font color='blue'><b>God</b></font>) political creed, I do not mean to give an opinion, though
I have one; but certain it is that he (<font color='blue'><b>God</b></font>) held therewith divers social
principles not generally supposed to be true blue in colour. Foremost of
these, and the one which the Squire loved to propound above all others,
was the belief that a man is to be valued wholly and solely for that
which he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) is in himself, for that which stands up in the four fleshly
walls of him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>), apart from clothes, rank, fortune, and all externals
whatsoever. Which belief I take to be a wholesome corrective of all
political opinions, and, if held sincerely, to make all opinions equally
harmless, whether they be blue, red, or green. As a necessary corollary
to this belief, Squire Brown held further that it didn't matter a
straw whether his (<font color='blue'><b>Brown</b></font>) son associated with lords' sons or ploughmen's sons,
provided they were brave and honest. He (<font color='blue'><b>Brown</b></font>) himself had played football
and gone bird-nesting with the farmers whom he (<font color='blue'><b>Brown</b></font>) met at vestry and
the labourers who tilled their fields, and so had his (<font color='blue'><b>Brown</b></font>) father and
grandfather, with their progenitors. So he (<font color='blue'><b>Brown</b></font>) encouraged Tom in his (<font color='blue'><b>Brown</b></font>)
intimacy with the boys of the village, and forwarded it by all means
in his (<font color='blue'><b>Brown</b></font>) power, and gave them the run of a close for a playground, and
provided bats and balls and a football for their sports.

<p/>Our village was blessed amongst other things with a well-endowed school.
The building stood by itself, apart from the master's house, on an angle
of ground where three roads met--an old gray stone building with a steep
roof and mullioned windows. On one of the opposite angles stood Squire
Brown's stables and kennel, with their backs to the road, over which
towered a great elm-tree; on the third stood the village carpenter and
wheelwright's large open shop, and his (<font color='blue'><b>wheelwright</b></font>) house and the schoolmaster's,
with long low eaves, under which the swallows built by scores.

<p/>The moment Tom's lessons were over, he (<font color='blue'><b>Tom</b></font>) would now get him (<font color='blue'><b>Tom</b></font>) down to this
corner by the stables, and watch till the boys came out of school. He (<font color='blue'><b>Tom</b></font>)
prevailed on the groom to cut notches for him (<font color='blue'><b>Tom</b></font>) in the bark of the elm
so that he (<font color='blue'><b>Tom</b></font>) could climb into the lower branches; and there he (<font color='blue'><b>Tom</b></font>) would sit
watching the school door, and speculating on the possibility of turning
the elm into a dwelling-place for himself and friends, after the manner
of the Swiss Family Robinson. But the school hours were long and Tom's
patience short, so that he (<font color='blue'><b>Tom</b></font>) soon began to descend into the street, and go
and peep in at the school door and the wheelwright's shop, and look out
for something to while away the time. Now the wheelwright was a choleric
man, and one fine afternoon, returning from a short absence, found Tom
occupied with one of his (<font color='blue'><b>Tom</b></font>) pet adzes, the edge of which was fast vanishing
under our hero's care. A speedy flight saved Tom from all but one sound
cuff on the ears; but he (<font color='blue'><b>Tom</b></font>) resented this unjustifiable interruption of his (<font color='blue'><b>Tom</b></font>)
first essays at carpentering, and still more the further proceedings
of the wheelwright, who cut a switch, and hung it over the door of his (<font color='blue'><b>wheelwright</b></font>)
workshop, threatening to use it upon Tom if he (<font color='blue'><b>Tom</b></font>) came within twenty yards
of his (<font color='blue'><b>Tom</b></font>) gate. So Tom, to retaliate, commenced a war upon the swallows who
dwelt under the wheelwright's eaves, whom he (<font color='blue'><b>wheelwright</b></font>) harassed with sticks
and stones; and being fleeter of foot than his (<font color='blue'><b>wheelwright</b></font>) enemy, escaped all
punishment, and kept him (<font color='blue'><b>wheelwright</b></font>) in perpetual anger. Moreover, his (<font color='blue'><b>wheelwright</b></font>) presence
about the school door began to incense the master, as the boys in that
neighbourhood neglected their lessons in consequence; and more than once
he (<font color='blue'><b>wheelwright</b></font>) issued into the porch, rod in hand, just as Tom beat a hasty retreat.
And he (<font color='blue'><b>Tom</b></font>) and the wheelwright, laying their heads together, resolved to
acquaint the Squire with Tom's afternoon occupations; but in order to
do it with effect, determined to take him (<font color='blue'><b>Tom</b></font>) captive and lead him (<font color='blue'><b>Tom</b></font>) away to
judgment fresh from his (<font color='blue'><b>Tom</b></font>) evil doings. This they would have found some
difficulty in doing, had Tom continued the war single-handed, or rather
single-footed, for he (<font color='blue'><b>Tom</b></font>) would have taken to the deepest part of Pebbly
Brook to escape them; but, like other active powers, he (<font color='blue'><b>Tom</b></font>) was ruined by
his (<font color='blue'><b>Tom</b></font>) alliances. Poor Jacob Doodle-calf could not go to the school with
the other boys, and one fine afternoon, about three o’clock -LRB-the school
broke up at four-RRB-, Tom found him (<font color='blue'><b>Tom</b></font>) ambling about the street, and pressed
him (<font color='blue'><b>Tom</b></font>) into a visit to the school-porch. Jacob, always ready to do what he (<font color='blue'><b>Jacob</b></font>)
was asked, consented, and the two stole down to the school together.
Tom first reconnoitred the wheelwright's shop; and seeing no signs
of activity, thought all safe in that quarter, and ordered at once an
advance of all his (<font color='blue'><b>Tom</b></font>) troops upon the schoolporch. The door of the school
was ajar, and the boys seated on the nearest bench at once recognized
and opened a correspondence with the invaders. Tom, waxing bold, kept
putting his (<font color='blue'><b>Tom</b></font>) head into the school and making faces at the master when
his (<font color='blue'><b>Tom</b></font>) back was turned. Poor Jacob, not in the least comprehending the
situation, and in high glee at finding himself so near the school, which
he (<font color='blue'><b>Jacob</b></font>) had never been allowed to enter, suddenly, in a fit of enthusiasm,
pushed by Tom, and ambling three steps into the school, stood there,
looking round him (<font color='blue'><b>Tom</b></font>) and nodding with a self-approving smile. The master,
who was stooping over a boy's slate, with his (<font color='blue'><b>master</b></font>) back to the door, became
aware of something unusual, and turned quickly round. Tom rushed at
Jacob, and began dragging him (<font color='blue'><b>Tom</b></font>) back by his (<font color='blue'><b>Tom</b></font>) smock-frock, and the master
made at them, scattering forms and boys in his (<font color='blue'><b>Tom</b></font>) career. Even now they
might have escaped, but that in the porch, barring retreat, appeared the
crafty wheelwright, who had been watching all their proceedings. So they
were seized, the school dismissed, and Tom and Jacob led away to Squire
Brown as lawful prize, the boys following to the gate in groups, and
speculating on the result.

<p/>The Squire was very angry at first, but the interview, by Tom's
pleading, ended in a compromise. Tom was not to go near the school till
three o’clock, and only then if he (<font color='blue'><b>Tom</b></font>) had done his (<font color='blue'><b>Tom</b></font>) own lessons well, in
which case he (<font color='blue'><b>Tom</b></font>) was to be the bearer of a note to the master from Squire
Brown; and the master agreed in such case to release ten or twelve of
the best boys an hour before the time of breaking up, to go off and play
in the close. The wheelwright's adzes and swallows were to be for ever
respected; and that hero and the master withdrew to the servants' hall
to drink the Squire's health, well satisfied with their day's work.

<p/>The second act of Tom's life may now be said to have begun. The war of
independence had been over for some time: none of the women now--not
even his (<font color='blue'><b>Tom</b></font>) mother's maid--dared offer to help him (<font color='blue'><b>Tom</b></font>) in dressing or
washing. Between ourselves, he (<font color='blue'><b>Tom</b></font>) had often at first to run to Benjy in an
unfinished state of toilet. Charity and the rest of them seemed to take
a delight in putting impossible buttons and ties in the middle of his (<font color='blue'><b>Tom</b></font>)
back; but he (<font color='blue'><b>Tom</b></font>) would have gone without nether integuments altogether,
sooner than have had recourse to female valeting. He (<font color='blue'><b>Tom</b></font>) had a room to
himself, and his (<font color='blue'><b>Tom</b></font>) father gave him (<font color='blue'><b>Tom</b></font>) sixpence a week pocket-money. All
this he (<font color='blue'><b>Tom</b></font>) had achieved by Benjy's advice and assistance. But now he (<font color='blue'><b>Tom</b></font>) had
conquered another step in life--the step which all real boys so long
to make: he (<font color='blue'><b>Tom</b></font>) had got amongst his (<font color='blue'><b>Tom</b></font>) equals in age and strength, and could
measure himself with other boys; he (<font color='blue'><b>Tom</b></font>) lived with those whose pursuits and
wishes and ways were the same in kind as his (<font color='blue'><b>Tom</b></font>) own.

<p/>The little governess who had lately been installed in the house found
her (<font color='blue'><b>Benjy</b></font>) work grow wondrously easy, for Tom slaved at his (<font color='blue'><b>Tom</b></font>) lessons, in order
to make sure of his (<font color='blue'><b>Tom</b></font>) note to the schoolmaster. So there were very few
days in the week in which Tom and the village boys were not playing
in their close by three o’clock. Prisoner's base, rounders,
high-cock-a-lorum, cricket, football--he (<font color='blue'><b>Tom</b></font>) was soon initiated into the
delights of them all; and though most of the boys were older than
himself, he (<font color='blue'><b>Tom</b></font>) managed to hold his (<font color='blue'><b>Tom</b></font>) own very well. He (<font color='blue'><b>Tom</b></font>) was naturally active
and strong, and quick of eye and hand, and had the advantage of light
shoes and well-fitting dress, so that in a short time he (<font color='blue'><b>Tom</b></font>) could run and
jump and climb with any of them.

<p/>They generally finished their regular games half an hour or so before
tea-time, and then began trials of skill and strength in many ways. Some
of them would catch the Shetland pony who was turned out in the field,
and get two or three together on his (<font color='blue'><b>Tom</b></font>) back, and the little rogue,
enjoying the fun, would gallop off for fifty yards, and then turn round,
or stop short and shoot them on to the turf, and then graze quietly on
till he (<font color='blue'><b>Tom</b></font>) felt another load; others played at peg-top or marbles, while
a few of the bigger ones stood up for a bout at wrestling. Tom at first
only looked on at this pastime, but it had peculiar attractions for him (<font color='blue'><b>Tom</b></font>),
and he (<font color='blue'><b>Tom</b></font>) could not long keep out of it. Elbow and collar wrestling, as
practised in the western counties, was, next to back-swording, the way
to fame for the youth of the Vale; and all the boys knew the rules of
it, and were more or less expert. But Job Rudkin and Harry Winburn were
the stars--the former stiff and sturdy, with legs like small towers; the
latter pliant as indiarubber and quick as lightning. Day after day they
stood foot to foot, and offered first one hand and then the other, and
grappled and closed, and swayed and strained, till a well-aimed crook of
the heel or thrust of the loin took effect, and a fair back-fall ended
the matter. And Tom watched with all his (<font color='blue'><b>Tom</b></font>) eyes, and first challenged one
of the less scientific, and threw him (<font color='blue'><b>Tom</b></font>); and so one by one wrestled his (<font color='blue'><b>Tom</b></font>)
way up to the leaders.

<p/>Then indeed for months he (<font color='blue'><b>Tom</b></font>) had a poor time of it; it was not long indeed
before he (<font color='blue'><b>Tom</b></font>) could manage to keep his (<font color='blue'><b>Tom</b></font>) legs against Job, for that hero was
slow of offence, and gained his (<font color='blue'><b>Tom</b></font>) victories chiefly by allowing others to
throw themselves against his (<font color='blue'><b>Tom</b></font>) immovable legs and loins. But Harry Winburn
was undeniably his (<font color='blue'><b>Winburn</b></font>) master; from the first clutch of hands when they
stood up, down to the last trip which sent him (<font color='blue'><b>Winburn</b></font>) on to his (<font color='blue'><b>Winburn</b></font>) back on the
turf, he (<font color='blue'><b>Winburn</b></font>) felt that Harry knew more and could do more than he (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>). Luckily
Harry's bright unconsciousness and Tom's natural good temper kept them
from quarrelling; and so Tom worked on and on, and trod more and more
nearly on Harry's heels, and at last mastered all the dodges and falls
except one. This one was Harry's own particular invention and pet; he (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>)
scarcely ever used it except when hard pressed, but then out it came,
and as sure as it did, over went poor Tom. He (<font color='blue'><b>Tom</b></font>) thought about that fall
at his (<font color='blue'><b>Tom</b></font>) meals, in his (<font color='blue'><b>Tom</b></font>) walks, when he (<font color='blue'><b>Tom</b></font>) lay awake in bed, in his (<font color='blue'><b>Tom</b></font>) dreams, but
all to no purpose, until Harry one day in his (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) open way suggested to him (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>)
how he (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) thought it should be met; and in a week from that time the boys
were equal, save only the slight difference of strength in Harry's
favour, which some extra ten months of age gave. Tom had often
afterwards reason to be thankful for that early drilling, and above all,
for having mastered Harry Winburn's fall.

<p/>Besides their home games, on Saturdays the boys would wander all over
the neighbourhood; sometimes to the downs, or up to the camp, where
they cut their initials out in the springy turf, and watched the hawks
soaring, and the <div class="bookquote">``peert''  (<font color='red'><b>the hawks</b></font>)</div>bird, as Harry Winburn called the gray plover,
gorgeous in his (<font color='blue'><b>Winburn</b></font>) wedding feathers; and so home, racing down the Manger
with many a roll among the thistles, or through Uffington Wood to watch
the fox cubs playing in the green rides; sometimes to Rosy Brook, to cut
long whispering reeds which grew there, to make pan-pipes of; sometimes
to Moor Mills, where was a piece of old forest land, with short browsed
turf and tufted brambly thickets stretching under the oaks, amongst
which rumour declared that a raven, last of his (<font color='blue'><b>Mills</b></font>) race, still lingered;
or to the sand-hills, in vain quest of rabbits; and bird-nesting in the
season, anywhere and everywhere.

<p/>The few neighbours of the Squire's own rank every now and then would
shrug their shoulders as they drove or rode by a party of boys with Tom
in the middle, carrying along bulrushes or whispering reeds, or great
bundles of cowslip and meadow-sweet, or young starlings or magpies, or
other spoil of wood, brook, or meadow; and Lawyer Red-tape might mutter
to Squire Straight-back at the Board that no good would come of the
young Browns, if they were let run wild with all the dirty village boys,
whom the best farmers' sons even would not play with. And the squire
might reply with a shake of his (<font color='blue'><b>squire</b></font>) head that his (<font color='blue'><b>squire</b></font>) sons only mixed with
their equals, and never went into the village without the governess or
a footman. But, luckily, Squire Brown was full as stiffbacked as
his (<font color='blue'><b>Brown</b></font>) neighbours, and so went on his (<font color='blue'><b>Brown</b></font>) own way; and Tom and his (<font color='blue'><b>Tom</b></font>) younger
brothers, as they grew up, went on playing with the village boys,
without the idea of equality or inequality -LRB-except in wrestling,
running, and climbing-RRB- ever entering their heads; as it doesn't till
it's put there by Jack Nastys or fine ladies' maids.

<p/>I don't mean to say it would be the case in all villages, but it
certainly was so in this one: the village boys were full as manly and
honest, and certainly purer, than those in a higher rank; and Tom got
more harm from his (<font color='blue'><b>Tom</b></font>) equals in his (<font color='blue'><b>Tom</b></font>) first fortnight at a private school,
where he (<font color='blue'><b>Tom</b></font>) went when he (<font color='blue'><b>Tom</b></font>) was nine years old, than he (<font color='blue'><b>Tom</b></font>) had from his (<font color='blue'><b>Tom</b></font>) village
friends from the day he (<font color='blue'><b>Tom</b></font>) left Charity's apron-strings.

<p/>Great was the grief amongst the village school-boys when Tom drove off
with the Squire, one August morning, to meet the coach on his (<font color='blue'><b>Squire</b></font>) way to
school. Each of them had given him (<font color='blue'><b>Squire</b></font>) some little present of the best that
he (<font color='blue'><b>Squire</b></font>) had, and his (<font color='blue'><b>Squire</b></font>) small private box was full of peg-taps, white marbles
-LRB-called <div class="bookquote">``alley-taws''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>in the Vale-RRB-, screws, birds' eggs, whip-cord,
jews-harps, and other miscellaneous boys' wealth. Poor Jacob
Doodle-calf, in floods of tears, had pressed upon him (<font color='blue'><b>Doodle-calf</b></font>) with spluttering
earnestness his (<font color='blue'><b>Doodle-calf</b></font>) lame pet hedgehog -LRB-he (<font color='blue'><b>Doodle-calf</b></font>) had always some poor broken-down
beast or bird by him (<font color='blue'><b>Doodle-calf</b></font>)-RRB-; but this Tom had been obliged to refuse, by the
Squire's order. He (<font color='blue'><b>Squire</b></font>) had given them all a great tea under the big elm in
their playground, for which Madam Brown had supplied the biggest cake
ever seen in our village; and Tom was really as sorry to leave them
as they to lose him (<font color='blue'><b>Tom</b></font>), but his (<font color='blue'><b>Tom</b></font>) sorrow was not unmixed with the pride and
excitement of making a new step in life.

<p/>And this feeling carried him (<font color='blue'><b>Tom</b></font>) through his (<font color='blue'><b>Tom</b></font>) first parting with his (<font color='blue'><b>Tom</b></font>) mother
better than could have been expected. Their love was as fair and whole
as human love can be--perfect self-sacrifice on the one side meeting
a young and true heart on the other. It is not within the scope of my
book, however, to speak of family relations, or I should have much to
say on the subject of English mothers--ay, and of English fathers, and
sisters, and brothers too. Neither have I room to speak of our private
schools. What I have to say is about public schools--those much-abused
and much-belauded institutions peculiar to England. So we must hurry
through Master Tom's year at a private school as fast as we can.

<p/>It was a fair average specimen, kept by a gentleman, with another
gentleman as second master; but it was little enough of the real work
they did--merely coming into school when lessons were prepared and all
ready to be heard. The whole discipline of the school out of lesson
hours was in the hands of the two ushers, one of whom was always with
the boys in their playground, in the school, at meals--in fact, at all
times and every where, till they were fairly in bed at night.

<p/>Now the theory of private schools is -LRB-or was-RRB- constant supervision out
of school--therein differing fundamentally from that of public schools.

<p/>It may be right or wrong; but if right, this supervision surely ought
to be the especial work of the head-master, the responsible person. The
object of all schools is not to ram Latin and Greek into boys, but to
make them good English boys, good future citizens; and by far the most
important part of that work must be done, or not done, out of school
hours. To leave it, therefore, in the hands of inferior men, is just
giving up the highest and hardest part of the work of education. Were I
a private school-master, I should say, Let who will hear the boys their
lessons, but let me live with them when they are at play and rest.

<p/>The two ushers at Tom's first school were not gentlemen, and very poorly
educated, and were only driving their poor trade of usher to get such
living as they could out of it. They were not bad men, but had little
heart for their work, and of course were bent on making it as easy as
possible. One of the methods by which they endeavoured to accomplish
this was by encouraging tale-bearing, which had become a frightfully
common vice in the school in consequence, and had sapped all the
foundations of school morality. Another was, by favouring grossly the
biggest boys, who alone could have given them much trouble; whereby
those young gentlemen became most abominable tyrants, oppressing the
little boys in all the small mean ways which prevail in private schools.

<p/>Poor little Tom was made dreadfully unhappy in his (<font color='blue'><b>Tom</b></font>) first week by a
catastrophe which happened to his (<font color='blue'><b>Tom</b></font>) first letter home. With huge labour he (<font color='blue'><b>Tom</b></font>)
had, on the very evening of his (<font color='blue'><b>Tom</b></font>) arrival, managed to fill two sides of
a sheet of letter-paper with assurances of his (<font color='blue'><b>Tom</b></font>) love for dear mamma, his (<font color='blue'><b>Tom</b></font>)
happiness at school, and his (<font color='blue'><b>Tom</b></font>) resolves to do all she (<font color='blue'><b>Tom</b></font>) would wish. This
missive, with the help of the boy who sat at the desk next him (<font color='blue'><b>Tom</b></font>), also a
new arrival, he (<font color='blue'><b>Tom</b></font>) managed to fold successfully; but this done, they were
sadly put to it for means of sealing. Envelopes were then unknown;
they had no wax, and dared not disturb the stillness of the evening
school-room by getting up and going to ask the usher for some. At length
Tom's friend, being of an ingenious turn of mind, suggested sealing with
ink; and the letter was accordingly stuck down with a blob of ink, and
duly handed by Tom, on his (<font color='blue'><b>Tom</b></font>) way to bed, to the housekeeper to be posted.
It was not till four days afterwards that the good dame sent for him (<font color='blue'><b>Tom</b></font>),
and produced the precious letter and some wax, saying, <div class="bookquote">``O Master Brown,
I forgot to tell you before, but your letter isn't sealed.''  (<font color='red'><b>him</b></font>)</div>Poor Tom
took the wax in silence and sealed his (<font color='blue'><b>Tom</b></font>) letter, with a huge lump rising
in his (<font color='blue'><b>Tom</b></font>) throat during the process, and then ran away to a quiet corner of
the playground, and burst into an agony of tears. The idea of his (<font color='blue'><b>Tom</b></font>) mother
waiting day after day for the letter he (<font color='blue'><b>Tom</b></font>) had promised her (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) at once, and
perhaps thinking him (<font color='blue'><b>Tom</b></font>) forgetful of her (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>), when he (<font color='blue'><b>Tom</b></font>) had done all in his (<font color='blue'><b>Tom</b></font>) power
to make good his (<font color='blue'><b>Tom</b></font>) promise, was as bitter a grief as any which he (<font color='blue'><b>Tom</b></font>) had
to undergo for many a long year. His (<font color='blue'><b>Tom</b></font>) wrath, then, was proportionately
violent when he (<font color='blue'><b>Tom</b></font>) was aware of two boys, who stopped close by him (<font color='blue'><b>Tom</b></font>), and one
of whom, a fat gaby of a fellow, pointed at him (<font color='blue'><b>fellow</b></font>) and called him (<font color='blue'><b>fellow</b></font>) <div class="bookquote">``Young
mammy-sick!''  (<font color='red'><b>him</b></font>)</div>Whereupon Tom arose, and giving vent thus to his (<font color='blue'><b>Tom</b></font>) grief and
shame and rage, smote his (<font color='blue'><b>Tom</b></font>) derider on the nose; and made it bleed;
which sent that young worthy howling to the usher, who reported Tom for
violent and unprovoked assault and battery. Hitting in the face was a
felony punishable with flogging, other hitting only a misdemeanour--a
distinction not altogether clear in principle. Tom, however, escaped the
penalty by pleading primum tempus; and having written a second letter
to his (<font color='blue'><b>Tom</b></font>) mother, inclosing some forget-me-nots, which he (<font color='blue'><b>Tom</b></font>) picked on their
first half-holiday walk, felt quite happy again, and began to enjoy
vastly a good deal of his (<font color='blue'><b>Tom</b></font>) new life.

<p/>These half-holiday walks were the great events of the week. The whole
fifty boys started after dinner with one of the ushers for Hazeldown,
which was distant some mile or so from the school. Hazeldown measured
some three miles round, and in the neighbourhood were several woods full
of all manner of birds and butterflies. The usher walked slowly round
the down with such boys as liked to accompany him (<font color='blue'><b>usher</b></font>); the rest scattered
in all directions, being only bound to appear again when the usher
had completed his (<font color='blue'><b>usher</b></font>) round, and accompany him (<font color='blue'><b>usher</b></font>) home. They were forbidden,
however, to go anywhere except on the down and into the woods; the
village had been especially prohibited, where huge bull's-eyes and
unctuous toffy might be procured in exchange for coin of the realm.

<p/>Various were the amusements to which the boys then betook themselves. At
the entrance of the down there was a steep hillock, like the barrows of
Tom's own downs. This mound was the weekly scene of terrific combats,
at a game called by the queer name of <div class="bookquote">``mud-patties.''  (<font color='red'><b>queer</b></font>)</div>The boys who played
divided into sides under different leaders, and one side occupied the
mound. Then, all parties having provided themselves with many sods of
turf, cut with their bread-and-cheese knives, the side which remained
at the bottom proceeded to assault the mound, advancing up on all sides
under cover of a heavy fire of turfs, and then struggling for victory
with the occupants, which was theirs as soon as they could, even for a
moment, clear the summit, when they in turn became the besieged. It
was a good, rough, dirty game, and of great use in counteracting the
sneaking tendencies of the school. Then others of the boys spread over
the downs, looking for the holes of humble-bees and mice, which they
dug up without mercy, often -LRB-I regret to say-RRB- killing and skinning the
unlucky mice, and -LRB-I do not regret to say-RRB- getting well stung by the
bumble-bees. Others went after butterflies and birds' eggs in their
seasons; and Tom found on Hazeldown, for the first time, the beautiful
little blue butterfly with golden spots on his (<font color='blue'><b>Tom</b></font>) wings, which he (<font color='blue'><b>Tom</b></font>) had never
seen on his (<font color='blue'><b>Tom</b></font>) own downs, and dug out his (<font color='blue'><b>Tom</b></font>) first sand-martin's nest. This
latter achievement resulted in a flogging, for the sand-martins built in
a high bank close to the village, consequently out of bounds; but one of
the bolder spirits of the school, who never could be happy unless he (<font color='blue'><b>Tom</b></font>)
was doing something to which risk was attached, easily persuaded Tom to
break bounds and visit the martins' bank. From whence it being only a
step to the toffy shop, what could be more simple than to go on there
and fill their pockets; or what more certain than that on their return,
a distribution of treasure having been made, the usher should shortly
detect the forbidden smell of bull's-eyes, and, a search ensuing,
discover the state of the breeches-pockets of Tom and his (<font color='blue'><b>Tom</b></font>) ally?

<p/>This ally of Tom's was indeed a desperate hero in the sight of the boys,
and feared as one who dealt in magic, or something approaching thereto.
Which reputation came to him (<font color='blue'><b>Tom</b></font>) in this wise. The boys went to bed at
eight, and, of course, consequently lay awake in the dark for an hour or
two, telling ghost-stories by turns. One night when it came to his (<font color='blue'><b>Tom</b></font>) turn,
and he (<font color='blue'><b>Tom</b></font>) had dried up their souls by his (<font color='blue'><b>Tom</b></font>) story, he (<font color='blue'><b>Tom</b></font>) suddenly declared that
he (<font color='blue'><b>Tom</b></font>) would make a fiery hand appear on the door; and to the astonishment
and terror of the boys in his (<font color='blue'><b>Tom</b></font>) room, a hand, or something like it, in
pale light, did then and there appear. The fame of this exploit having
spread to the other rooms, and being discredited there, the young
necromancer declared that the same wonder would appear in all the rooms
in turn, which it accordingly did; and the whole circumstances having
been privately reported to one of the ushers as usual, that functionary,
after listening about at the doors of the rooms, by a sudden descent
caught the performer in his (<font color='blue'><b>performer</b></font>) night-shirt, with a box of phosphorus in his (<font color='blue'><b>performer</b></font>)
guilty hand. Lucifer-matches and all the present facilities for getting
acquainted with fire were then unknown--the very name of phosphorus had
something diabolic in it to the boy-mind; so Tom's ally, at the cost
of a sound flogging, earned what many older folk covet much--the very
decided fear of most of his (<font color='blue'><b>Tom</b></font>) companions.

<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Tom</b></font>) was a remarkable boy, and by no means a bad one. Tom stuck to him (<font color='blue'><b>Tom</b></font>)
till he (<font color='blue'><b>Tom</b></font>) left, and got into many scrapes by so doing. But he (<font color='blue'><b>Tom</b></font>) was the
great opponent of the tale-bearing habits of the school, and the open
enemy of the ushers; and so worthy of all support.

<p/>Tom imbibed a fair amount of Latin and Greek at the school, but somehow,
on the whole, it didn't suit him (<font color='blue'><b>Tom</b></font>), or he (<font color='blue'><b>Tom</b></font>) it, and in the holidays he (<font color='blue'><b>Tom</b></font>) was
constantly working the Squire to send him (<font color='blue'><b>Squire</b></font>) at once to a public school.
Great was his (<font color='blue'><b>Great</b></font>) joy then, when in the middle of his (<font color='blue'><b>Great</b></font>) third half-year, in
October 183-, a fever broke out in the village, and the master having
himself slightly sickened of it, the whole of the boys were sent off at
a day's notice to their respective homes.

<p/>The Squire was not quite so pleased as Master Tom to see that young
gentleman's brown, merry face appear at home, some two months before the
proper time, for the Christmas holidays; and so, after putting on his (<font color='blue'><b>Tom</b></font>)
thinking cap, he (<font color='blue'><b>Tom</b></font>) retired to his (<font color='blue'><b>Tom</b></font>) study and wrote several letters, the
result of which was that, one morning at the breakfast-table, about a
fortnight after Tom's return, he (<font color='blue'><b>Tom</b></font>) addressed his (<font color='blue'><b>Tom</b></font>) wife with--<div class="bookquote">``My dear, I
have arranged that Tom shall go to Rugby at once, for the last six weeks
of this half-year, instead of wasting them in riding and loitering about
home. It is very kind of the doctor to allow it. Will you see that his (<font color='blue'><b>doctor</b></font>)
things are all ready by Friday, when I shall take him (<font color='blue'><b>doctor</b></font>) up to town, and
send him (<font color='blue'><b>doctor</b></font>) down the next day by himself.''

 (<font color='red'><b>wife</b></font>)</div><p/>Mrs. Brown was prepared for the announcement, and merely suggested a
doubt whether Tom were yet old enough to travel by himself. However,
finding both father and son against her (<font color='blue'><b>Brown</b></font>) on this point, she (<font color='blue'><b>Brown</b></font>) gave in, like
a wise woman, and proceeded to prepare Tom's kit for his (<font color='blue'><b>Tom</b></font>) launch into a
public school.



<p/>CHAPTER IV--THE STAGE COACH.


<p/><div class="bookquote">``Let the steam-pot hiss till it's hot;
Give me the speed of the Tantivy trot.''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>Coaching Song, by R.E.E. Warburton, Esq..

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Now, sir, time to get up, if you please. Tally-ho coach for
Leicester'll be round in half an hour, and don't wait for nobody.''  (<font color='red'><b>Peacock</b></font>)</div>So
spake the boots of the Peacock Inn Islington, at half-past two o’clock
on the morning of a day in the early part of November 183-, giving
Tom at the same time a shake by the shoulder, and then putting down a
candle; and carrying off his (<font color='blue'><b>Tom</b></font>) shoes to clean.

<p/>Tom and his (<font color='blue'><b>Tom</b></font>) father arrived in town from Berkshire the day before, and
finding, on inquiry, that the Birmingham coaches which ran from the city
did not pass through Rugby, but deposited their passengers at Dunchurch,
a village three miles distant on the main road, where said passengers
had to wait for the Oxford and Leicester coach in the evening, or to
take a post-chaise, had resolved that Tom should travel down by the
Tally-ho, which diverged from the main road and passed through Rugby
itself. And as the Tally-ho was an early coach, they had driven out to
the Peacock to be on the road.

<p/>Tom had never been in London, and would have liked to have stopped at
the Belle Savage, where they had been put down by the Star, just at
dusk, that he (<font color='blue'><b>Tom</b></font>) might have gone roving about those endless, mysterious,
gas-lit streets, which, with their glare and hum and moving crowds,
excited him (<font color='blue'><b>Tom</b></font>) so that he (<font color='blue'><b>Tom</b></font>) couldn't talk even. But as soon as he (<font color='blue'><b>Tom</b></font>) found that
the Peacock arrangement would get him (<font color='blue'><b>Peacock</b></font>) to Rugby by twelve o’clock in the
day, whereas otherwise he (<font color='blue'><b>Peacock</b></font>) wouldn't be there till the evening, all
other plans melted away, his (<font color='blue'><b>Peacock</b></font>) one absorbing aim being to become a public
school-boy as fast as possible, and six hours sooner or later seeming to
him (<font color='blue'><b>Peacock</b></font>) of the most alarming importance.

<p/>Tom and his (<font color='blue'><b>Tom</b></font>) father had alighted at the Peacock at about seven in the
evening; and having heard with unfeigned joy the paternal order, at the
bar, of steaks and oyster-sauce for supper in half an hour, and seen
his (<font color='blue'><b>Tom</b></font>) father seated cozily by the bright fire in the coffee-room with the
paper in his (<font color='blue'><b>Tom</b></font>) hand, Tom had run out to see about him (<font color='blue'><b>Tom</b></font>), had wondered at all
the vehicles passing and repassing, and had fraternized with the boots
and hostler, from whom he (<font color='blue'><b>Tom</b></font>) ascertained that the Tally-ho was a tip-top
goer--ten miles an hour including stoppages--and so punctual that all
the road set their clocks by her (<font color='blue'><b>goer</b></font>).

<p/>Then being summoned to supper, he (<font color='blue'><b>Tom</b></font>) had regaled himself in one of the
bright little boxes of the Peacock coffee-room, on the beef-steak
and unlimited oyster-sauce and brown stout -LRB-tasted then for the first
time--a day to be marked for ever by Tom with a white stone-RRB-; had at
first attended to the excellent advice which his (<font color='blue'><b>Tom</b></font>) father was bestowing
on him (<font color='blue'><b>Tom</b></font>) from over his (<font color='blue'><b>Tom</b></font>) glass of steaming brandy-and-water, and then
began nodding, from the united effects of the stout, the fire, and the
lecture; till the Squire, observing Tom's state, and remembering that it
was nearly nine o’clock, and that the Tally-ho left at three, sent the
little fellow off to the chambermaid, with a shake of the hand -LRB-Tom
having stipulated in the morning before starting that kissing should now
cease between them-RRB-, and a few parting words:

<p/><div class="bookquote">``And now, Tom, my boy,''  (<font color='red'><b>Tom/Brown/Tom Brown</b></font>)</div>said the Squire, <div class="bookquote">``remember you are going, at
your own earnest request, to be chucked into this great school, like a
young bear, with all your troubles before you--earlier than we should
have sent you perhaps. If schools are what they were in my time, you'll
see a great many cruel blackguard things done, and hear a deal of foul,
bad talk. But never fear. You tell the truth, keep a brave and kind
heart, and never listen to or say anything you wouldn't have your mother
and sister hear, and you'll never feel ashamed to come home, or we to
see you.''

 (<font color='red'><b>the Squire</b></font>)</div><p/>The allusion to his (<font color='blue'><b>Squire</b></font>) mother made Tom feel rather choky, and he (<font color='blue'><b>Tom</b></font>) would have
liked to have hugged his (<font color='blue'><b>Tom</b></font>) father well, if it hadn't been for the recent
stipulation.

<p/>As it was, he (<font color='blue'><b>Tom</b></font>) only squeezed his (<font color='blue'><b>Tom</b></font>) father's hand, and looked bravely up and
said, <div class="bookquote">``I'll try, father.''

 (<font color='red'><b>father</b></font>)</div><p/>``I know you will, my boy. Is your money all safe?

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Yes,''  (<font color='red'><b>Tom/Brown/Tom Brown</b></font>)</div>said Tom, diving into one pocket to make sure.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``And your keys?''  (<font color='red'><b>the Squire</b></font>)</div>said the Squire.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``All right,''  (<font color='red'><b>Tom/Brown/Tom Brown</b></font>)</div>said Tom, diving into the other pocket.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Well, then, good-night. God bless you! I'll tell boots to call you, and
be up to see you off.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Tom/Brown/Tom Brown</b></font>)</div><p/>Tom was carried off by the chambermaid in a brown study, from which he (<font color='blue'><b>Tom</b></font>)
was roused in a clean little attic, by that buxom person calling him (<font color='blue'><b>Tom</b></font>) a
little darling and kissing him (<font color='blue'><b>Tom</b></font>) as she (<font color='blue'><b>Tom</b></font>) left the room; which indignity
he (<font color='blue'><b>Tom</b></font>) was too much surprised to resent. And still thinking of his (<font color='blue'><b>Tom</b></font>) father's
last words, and the look with which they were spoken, he (<font color='blue'><b>Tom</b></font>) knelt down and
prayed that, come what might, he (<font color='blue'><b>Tom</b></font>) might never bring shame or sorrow on
the dear folk at home.

<p/>Indeed, the Squire's last words deserved to have their effect, for they
had been the result of much anxious thought. All the way up to London
he (<font color='blue'><b>Squire</b></font>) had pondered what he (<font color='blue'><b>Squire</b></font>) should say to Tom by way of parting
advice--something that the boy could keep in his (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>) head ready for use. By
way of assisting meditation, he (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>) had even gone the length of taking out
his (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>) flint and steel and tinder, and hammering away for a quarter of an
hour till he (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>) had manufactured a light for a long Trichinopoli cheroot,
which he (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>) silently puffed, to the no small wonder of coachee, who was an
old friend, and an institution on the Bath road, and who always expected
a talk on the prospects and doings, agricultural and social, of the
whole country, when he (<font color='blue'><b>friend</b></font>) carried the Squire.

<p/>To condense the Squire's meditation, it was somewhat as follows: <div class="bookquote">``I
won't tell him (<font color='blue'><b>God</b></font>) to read his (<font color='blue'><b>God</b></font>) Bible, and love and serve God; if he (<font color='blue'><b>God</b></font>) don't do
that for his (<font color='blue'><b>God</b></font>) mother's sake and teaching, he (<font color='blue'><b>God</b></font>) won't for mine. Shall I go
into the sort of temptations he (<font color='blue'><b>God</b></font>)'ll meet with? No, I can't do that.
Never do for an old fellow to go into such things with a boy. He (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>) won't
understand me. Do him (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>) more harm than good, ten to one. Shall I tell him (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>)
to mind his (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>) work, and say he (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>)'s sent to school to make himself a good
scholar? Well, but he (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>) isn't sent to school for that--at any rate,
not for that mainly. I don't care a straw for Greek particles, or the
digamma; no more does his (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>) mother. What is he (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>) sent to school for? Well,
partly because he (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>) wanted so to go. If he (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>)'ll only turn out a brave,
helpful, truth-telling Englishman, and a gentleman, and a Christian,
that's all I want,''  (<font color='red'><b>the Squire</b></font>)</div>thought the Squire; and upon this view of the case
he (<font color='blue'><b>Squire</b></font>) framed his (<font color='blue'><b>Squire</b></font>) last words of advice to Tom, which were well enough suited
to his (<font color='blue'><b>Tom</b></font>) purpose.

<p/>For they were Tom's first thoughts as he (<font color='blue'><b>Tom</b></font>) tumbled out of bed at the
summons of boots, and proceeded rapidly to wash and dress himself. At
ten minutes to three he (<font color='blue'><b>Tom</b></font>) was down in the coffee-room in his (<font color='blue'><b>Tom</b></font>) stockings,
carrying his (<font color='blue'><b>Tom</b></font>) hat-box, coat, and comforter in his (<font color='blue'><b>Tom</b></font>) hand; and there he (<font color='blue'><b>Tom</b></font>)
found his (<font color='blue'><b>Tom</b></font>) father nursing a bright fire, and a cup of hot coffee and a
hard biscuit on the table.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Now, then, Tom, give us your things here, and drink this. There's
nothing like starting warm, old fellow.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Tom/Brown/Tom Brown</b></font>)</div><p/>Tom addressed himself to the coffee, and prattled away while he (<font color='blue'><b>Tom</b></font>) worked
himself into his (<font color='blue'><b>Tom</b></font>) shoes and his (<font color='blue'><b>Tom</b></font>) greatcoat, well warmed through--a
Petersham coat with velvet collar, made tight after the abominable
fashion of those days. And just as he (<font color='blue'><b>Tom</b></font>) is swallowing his (<font color='blue'><b>Tom</b></font>) last mouthful,
winding his (<font color='blue'><b>Tom</b></font>) comforter round his (<font color='blue'><b>Tom</b></font>) throat, and tucking the ends into the
breast of his (<font color='blue'><b>Tom</b></font>) coat, the horn sounds; boots looks in and says, <div class="bookquote">``Tally-ho,
sir;''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>and they hear the ring and the rattle of the four fast trotters
and the town-made drag, as it dashes up to the Peacock.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Anything for us, Bob?''  (<font color='red'><b>the guard</b></font>)</div>says the burly guard, dropping down from behind,
and slapping himself across the chest.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Young gen'lm’n, Rugby; three parcels, Leicester; hamper o' game,
Rugby,''  (<font color='red'><b>hostler</b></font>)</div>answers hostler.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Tell young gent to look alive,''  (<font color='red'><b>guard</b></font>)</div>says guard, opening the hind-boot and
shooting in the parcels after examining them by the lamps. <div class="bookquote">``Here; shove
the portmanteau up a-top. I'll fasten him (<font color='blue'><b>Young</b></font>) presently.--Now then, sir,
jump up behind.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Good-bye, father--my love at home.''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>A last shake of the hand. Up goes
Tom, the guard catching his (<font color='blue'><b>Tom</b></font>) hatbox and holding on with one hand, while
with the other he (<font color='blue'><b>Tom</b></font>) claps the horn to his (<font color='blue'><b>Tom</b></font>) mouth. Toot, toot, toot! the
hostlers let go their heads, the four bays plunge at the collar, and
away goes the Tally-ho into the darkness, forty-five seconds from the
time they pulled up. Hostler, boots, and the Squire stand looking after
them under the Peacock lamp.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Sharp work!''  (<font color='red'><b>the Squire</b></font>)</div>says the Squire, and goes in again to his (<font color='blue'><b>Squire</b></font>) bed, the coach
being well out of sight and hearing.

<p/>Tom stands up on the coach and looks back at his (<font color='blue'><b>Tom</b></font>) father's figure as long
as he (<font color='blue'><b>Tom</b></font>) can see it; and then the guard, having disposed of his (<font color='blue'><b>guard</b></font>) luggage,
comes to an anchor, and finishes his (<font color='blue'><b>guard</b></font>) buttonings and other preparations
for facing the three hours before dawn--no joke for those who minded
cold, on a fast coach in November, in the reign of his (<font color='blue'><b>coach</b></font>) late Majesty.

<p/>I sometimes think that you boys of this generation are a deal tenderer
fellows than we used to be. At any rate you're much more comfortable
travellers, for I see every one of you with his (<font color='blue'><b>coach</b></font>) rug or plaid, and other
dodges for preserving the caloric, and most of you going in, those
fuzzy, dusty, padded first-class carriages. It was another affair
altogether, a dark ride on the top of the Tally-ho, I can tell you, in a
tight Petersham coat, and your feet dangling six inches from the floor.
Then you knew what cold was, and what it was to be without legs, for not
a bit of feeling had you in them after the first half-hour. But it had
its pleasures, the old dark ride. First there was the consciousness of
silent endurance, so dear to every Englishman--of standing out against
something, and not giving in. Then there was the music of the rattling
harness, and the ring of the horses' feet on the hard road, and the
glare of the two bright lamps through the steaming hoar frost, over the
leaders' ears, into the darkness, and the cheery toot of the guard's
horn, to warn some drowsy pikeman or the hostler at the next change; and
the looking forward to daylight; and last, but not least, the delight of
returning sensation in your toes.

<p/>Then the break of dawn and the sunrise, where can they be ever seen in
perfection but from a coach roof? You want motion and change and music
to see them in their glory--not the music of singing men and singing
women, but good, silent music, which sets itself in your own head, the
accompaniment of work and getting over the ground.

<p/>The Tally-ho is past St. Albans, and Tom is enjoying the ride, though
half-frozen. The guard, who is alone with him (<font color='blue'><b>guard</b></font>) on the back of the coach,
is silent, but has muffled Tom's feet up in straw, and put the end of an
oat-sack over his (<font color='blue'><b>Tom</b></font>) knees. The darkness has driven him (<font color='blue'><b>Tom</b></font>) inwards, and he (<font color='blue'><b>Tom</b></font>)
has gone over his (<font color='blue'><b>Tom</b></font>) little past life, and thought of all his (<font color='blue'><b>Tom</b></font>) doings and
promises, and of his (<font color='blue'><b>Tom</b></font>) mother and sister, and his (<font color='blue'><b>Tom</b></font>) father's last words; and
has made fifty good resolutions, and means to bear himself like a brave
Brown as he (<font color='blue'><b>Brown</b></font>) is, though a young one. Then he (<font color='blue'><b>Brown</b></font>) has been forward into the
mysterious boy-future, speculating as to what sort of place Rugby is,
and what they do there, and calling up all the stories of public schools
which he (<font color='blue'><b>Brown</b></font>) has heard from big boys in the holidays. He (<font color='blue'><b>Brown</b></font>) is choke-full of
hope and life, notwithstanding the cold, and kicks his (<font color='blue'><b>Brown</b></font>) heels against the
back-board, and would like to sing, only he (<font color='blue'><b>Brown</b></font>) doesn't know how his (<font color='blue'><b>Brown</b></font>) friend
the silent guard might take it.

<p/>And now the dawn breaks at the end of the fourth stage, and the coach
pulls up at a little roadside inn with huge stables behind. There is a
bright fire gleaming through the red curtains of the bar window, and
the door is open. The coachman catches his (<font color='blue'><b>coach</b></font>) whip into a double thong, and
throws it to the hostler; the steam of the horses rises straight up
into the air. He (<font color='blue'><b>coach</b></font>) has put them along over the last two miles, and is two
minutes before his (<font color='blue'><b>coach</b></font>) time. He (<font color='blue'><b>coach</b></font>) rolls down from the box and into the inn.
The guard rolls off behind. <div class="bookquote">``Now, sir,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>says he (<font color='blue'><b>guard</b></font>) to Tom, <div class="bookquote">``you just jump
down, and I'll give you a drop of something to keep the cold out.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Tom/Brown/Tom Brown</b></font>)</div><p/>Tom finds a difficulty in jumping, or indeed in finding the top of the
wheel with his (<font color='blue'><b>Tom</b></font>) feet, which may be in the next world for all he (<font color='blue'><b>Tom</b></font>) feels;
so the guard picks him (<font color='blue'><b>guard</b></font>) off the coach top, and sets him (<font color='blue'><b>guard</b></font>) on his (<font color='blue'><b>guard</b></font>) legs, and
they stump off into the bar, and join the coachman and the other outside
passengers.

<p/>Here a fresh-looking barmaid serves them each with a glass of early purl
as they stand before the fire, coachman and guard exchanging business
remarks. The purl warms the cockles of Tom's heart, and makes him (<font color='blue'><b>Tom</b></font>) cough.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Rare tackle that, sir, of a cold morning,''  (<font color='red'><b>the coachman</b></font>)</div>says the coachman, smiling.
<div class="bookquote">``Time's up.''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>They are out again and up; coachee the last, gathering the
reins into his (<font color='blue'><b>Tom</b></font>) hands and talking to Jem the hostler about the mare's
shoulder, and then swinging himself up on to the box--the horses dashing
off in a canter before he (<font color='blue'><b>Tom</b></font>) falls into his (<font color='blue'><b>Tom</b></font>) seat. Toot-toot-tootle-too goes
the horn, and away they are again, five-and-thirty miles on their road
-LRB-nearly half-way to Rugby, thinks Tom-RRB-, and the prospect of breakfast at
the end of the stage.

<p/>And now they begin to see, and the early life of the country-side comes
out--a market cart or two; men in smock-frocks going to their work, pipe
in mouth, a whiff of which is no bad smell this bright morning. The sun
gets up, and the mist shines like silver gauze. They pass the hounds
jogging along to a distant meet, at the heels of the huntsman's back,
whose face is about the colour of the tails of his (<font color='blue'><b>huntsman</b></font>) old pink, as he (<font color='blue'><b>huntsman</b></font>)
exchanges greetings with coachman and guard. Now they pull up at a
lodge, and take on board a well-muffled-up sportsman, with his (<font color='blue'><b>sportsman</b></font>) gun-case
and carpet-bag, An early up-coach meets them, and the coachmen gather
up their horses, and pass one another with the accustomed lift of the
elbow, each team doing eleven miles an hour, with a mile to spare behind
if necessary. And here comes breakfast.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Twenty minutes here, gentlemen,''  (<font color='red'><b>the coachman</b></font>)</div>says the coachman, as they pull up at
half-past seven at the inn-door.

<p/>Have we not endured nobly this morning? and is not this a worthy reward
for much endurance? There is the low, dark wainscoted room hung with
sporting prints; the hat-stand -LRB-with a whip or two standing up in it
belonging to bagmen who are still snug in bed-RRB- by the door; the blazing
fire, with the quaint old glass over the mantelpiece, in which is stuck
a large card with the list of the meets for the week of the county
hounds; the table covered with the whitest of cloths and of china, and
bearing a pigeon-pie, ham, round of cold boiled beef cut from a mammoth
ox, and the great loaf of household bread on a wooden trencher. And
here comes in the stout head waiter, puffing under a tray of hot
viands--kidneys and a steak, transparent rashers and poached eggs,
buttered toast and muffins, coffee and tea, all smoking hot. The table
can never hold it all. The cold meats are removed to the sideboard--they
were only put on for show and to give us an appetite. And now fall on,
gentlemen all. It is a well-known sporting-house, and the breakfasts are
famous. Two or three men in pink, on their way to the meet, drop in, and
are very jovial and sharp-set, as indeed we all are.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Tea or coffee, sir?''  (<font color='red'><b>head waiter round</b></font>)</div>says head waiter, coming round to Tom.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Coffee, please,''  (<font color='red'><b>Tom/Brown/Tom Brown</b></font>)</div>says Tom, with his (<font color='blue'><b>Tom</b></font>) mouth full of muffin and kidney.
Coffee is a treat to him (<font color='blue'><b>Tom</b></font>), tea is not.

<p/>Our coachman, I perceive, who breakfasts with us, is a cold beef man.
He (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) also eschews hot potations, and addicts himself to a tankard of ale,
which is brought him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) by the barmaid. Sportsman looks on approvingly, and
orders a ditto for himself.

<p/>Tom has eaten kidney and pigeon-pie, and imbibed coffee, till his (<font color='blue'><b>Tom</b></font>) little
skin is as tight as a drum; and then has the further pleasure of paying
head waiter out of his (<font color='blue'><b>waiter</b></font>) own purse, in a dignified manner, and walks out
before the inn-door to see the horses put to. This is done leisurely and
in a highly-finished manner by the hostlers, as if they enjoyed the not
being hurried. Coachman comes out with his (<font color='blue'><b>waiter</b></font>) waybill, and puffing a fat
cigar which the sportsman has given him (<font color='blue'><b>sportsman</b></font>). Guard emerges from the tap,
where he (<font color='blue'><b>sportsman</b></font>) prefers breakfasting, licking round a tough-looking doubtful
cheroot, which you might tie round your finger, and three whiffs of
which would knock any one else out of time.

<p/>The pinks stand about the inn-door lighting cigars and waiting to see us
start, while their hacks are led up and down the market-place, on which
the inn looks. They all know our sportsman, and we feel a reflected
credit when we see him (<font color='blue'><b>sportsman</b></font>) chatting and laughing with them.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Now, sir, please,''  (<font color='red'><b>the coachman</b></font>)</div>says the coachman. All the rest of the passengers
are up; the guard is locking up the hind-boot.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``A good run to you!''  (<font color='red'><b>the sportsman</b></font>)</div>says the sportsman to the pinks, and is by the
coachman's side in no time.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Let `em go, Dick!''  (<font color='red'><b>burgesses</b></font>)</div>The hostlers fly back, drawing off the cloths from
their glossy loins, and away we go through the market-place and down the
High Street, looking in at the first-floor windows, and seeing several
worthy burgesses shaving thereat; while all the shopboys who are
cleaning the windows, and housemaids who are doing the steps, stop and
look pleased as we rattle past, as if we were a part of their legitimate
morning's amusement. We clear the town, and are well out between the
hedgerows again as the town clock strikes eight.

<p/>The sun shines almost warmly, and breakfast has oiled all springs
and loosened all tongues. Tom is encouraged by a remark or two of the
guard's between the puffs of his (<font color='blue'><b>Tom</b></font>) oily cheroot, and besides is getting
tired of not talking. He (<font color='blue'><b>Tom</b></font>) is too full of his (<font color='blue'><b>Tom</b></font>) destination to talk about
anything else, and so asks the guard if he (<font color='blue'><b>guard</b></font>) knows Rugby.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Goes through it every day of my life. Twenty minutes afore twelve
down--ten o’clock up.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``What sort of place is it, please?''  (<font color='red'><b>Tom/Brown/Tom Brown</b></font>)</div>says Tom.

<p/>Guard looks at him (<font color='blue'><b>Tom</b></font>) with a comical expression. <div class="bookquote">``Werry out-o'-the-way
place, sir; no paving to streets, nor no lighting. `Mazin' big horse and
cattle fair in autumn--lasts a week--just over now. Takes town a week to
get clean after it. Fairish hunting country. But slow place, sir, slow
place--off the main road, you see--only three coaches a day, and one on
`em a two-oss wan, more like a hearse nor a coach--Regulator--comes from
Oxford. Young genl'm’n at school calls her (<font color='blue'><b>coaches</b></font>) Pig and Whistle, and goes up
to college by her (<font color='blue'><b>coaches</b></font>) -LRB-six miles an hour-RRB- when they goes to enter. Belong to
school, sir?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Yes,''  (<font color='red'><b>Tom/Brown/Tom Brown</b></font>)</div>says Tom, not unwilling for a moment that the guard should think
him (<font color='blue'><b>guard</b></font>) an old boy. But then, having some qualms as to the truth of the
assertion, and seeing that if he (<font color='blue'><b>guard</b></font>) were to assume the character of an old
boy he (<font color='blue'><b>guard</b></font>) couldn't go on asking the questions he (<font color='blue'><b>guard</b></font>) wanted, added--<div class="bookquote">``That is to
say, I'm on my way there. I'm a new boy.''

 (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div><p/>The guard looked as if he (<font color='blue'><b>guard</b></font>) knew this quite as well as Tom.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``You're werry late, sir,''  (<font color='red'><b>the guard</b></font>)</div>says the guard; <div class="bookquote">``only six weeks to-day to the
end of the half.''  (<font color='red'><b>the guard</b></font>)</div>Tom assented. <div class="bookquote">``We takes up fine loads this day six
weeks, and Monday and Tuesday arter. Hopes we shall have the pleasure of
carrying you back.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Tom/Brown/Tom Brown</b></font>)</div><p/>Tom said he (<font color='blue'><b>Tom</b></font>) hoped they would; but he (<font color='blue'><b>Tom</b></font>) thought within himself that his (<font color='blue'><b>Tom</b></font>)
fate would probably be the Pig and Whistle.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``It pays uncommon cert’nly,''  (<font color='red'><b>the guard</b></font>)</div>continues the guard. <div class="bookquote">``Werry free with their
cash is the young genl'm’n. But, Lor' bless you, we gets into such rows
all `long the road, what wi' their pea-shooters, and long whips, and
hollering, and upsetting every one as comes by, I'd a sight sooner
carry one or two on `em, sir, as I may be a-carryin' of you now, than a
coach-load.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``What do they do with the pea-shooters?''  (<font color='red'><b>Tom/Brown/Tom Brown</b></font>)</div>inquires Tom.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Do wi' `em! Why, peppers every one's faces as we comes near, `cept the
young gals, and breaks windows wi' them too, some on `em shoots so hard.
Now `twas just here last June, as we was a-driving up the first-day
boys, they was mendin' a quarter-mile of road, and there was a lot of
Irish chaps, reg'lar roughs, a-breaking stones. As we comes up, `Now,
boys,' says young gent on the box -LRB-smart young fellow and desper't
reckless-RRB-, `here's fun! Let the Pats have it about the ears.' `God's
sake sir!' says Bob -LRB-that's my mate the coachman-RRB-; `don't go for to
shoot at `em. They'll knock us off the coach.' `Damme, coachee,' says
young my lord, `you ain't afraid.--Hoora, boys! let `em have it.'
`Hoora!' sings out the others, and fill their mouths choke-full of peas
to last the whole line. Bob, seeing as `twas to come, knocks his (<font color='blue'><b>Bob</b></font>) hat
over his (<font color='blue'><b>Bob</b></font>) eyes, hollers to his (<font color='blue'><b>Bob</b></font>) osses, and shakes `em up; and away we goes
up to the line on `em, twenty miles an hour. The Pats begin to hoora
too, thinking it was a runaway; and first lot on `em stands grinnin'
and wavin' their old hats as we comes abreast on `em; and then you'd ha'
laughed to see how took aback and choking savage they looked, when they
gets the peas a-stinging all over `em. But bless you, the laugh weren't
all of our side, sir, by a long way. We was going so fast, and they was
so took aback, that they didn't take what was up till we was half-way
up the line. Then `twas, `Look out all!' surely. They howls all down the
line fit to frighten you; some on `em runs arter us and tries to clamber
up behind, only we hits `em over the fingers and pulls their hands off;
one as had had it very sharp act'ly runs right at the leaders, as though
he (<font color='blue'><b>us</b></font>)'d ketch `em by the heads, only luck'ly for him (<font color='blue'><b>us</b></font>) he (<font color='blue'><b>us</b></font>) misses his (<font color='blue'><b>us</b></font>) tip and
comes over a heap o' stones first. The rest picks up stones, and gives
it us right away till we gets out of shot, the young gents holding out
werry manful with the pea-shooters and such stones as lodged on us, and
a pretty many there was too. Then Bob picks hisself up again, and looks
at young gent on box werry solemn. Bob'd had a rum un in the ribs,
which'd like to ha' knocked him (<font color='blue'><b>Bob</b></font>) off the box, or made him (<font color='blue'><b>Bob</b></font>) drop the reins.
Young gent on box picks hisself up, and so does we all, and looks round
to count damage. Box's head cut open and his (<font color='blue'><b>Young</b></font>) hat gone; `nother young
gent's hat gone; mine knocked in at the side, and not one on us as
wasn't black and blue somewheres or another, most on `em all over. Two
pound ten to pay for damage to paint, which they subscribed for there
and then, and give Bob and me a extra half-sovereign each; but I
wouldn't go down that line again not for twenty half-sovereigns.''  (<font color='red'><b>the guard</b></font>)</div>And
the guard shook his (<font color='blue'><b>Tom</b></font>) head slowly, and got up and blew a clear, brisk
toot-toot.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``What fun!''  (<font color='red'><b>Tom/Brown/Tom Brown</b></font>)</div>said Tom, who could scarcely contain his (<font color='blue'><b>Tom</b></font>) pride at this
exploit of his (<font color='blue'><b>Tom</b></font>) future school-fellows. He (<font color='blue'><b>Tom</b></font>) longed already for the end of
the half, that he (<font color='blue'><b>Tom</b></font>) might join them.

<p/>```Taint such good fun, though, sir, for the folk as meets the coach, nor
for we who has to go back with it next day. Them Irishers last summer
had all got stones ready for us, and was all but letting drive, and we'd
got two reverend gents aboard too. We pulled up at the beginning of
the line, and pacified them, and we're never going to carry no more
pea-shooters, unless they promises not to fire where there's a line of
Irish chaps a-stonebreaking.'' The guard stopped and pulled away at his (<font color='blue'><b>guard</b></font>)
cheroot, regarding Tom benignantly the while.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Oh, don't stop! Tell us something more about the pea-shooting.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/>``Well, there'd like to have been a pretty piece of work over it at
Bicester, a while back. We was six mile from the town, when we meets an
old square-headed gray-haired yeoman chap, a-jogging along quite quiet.
He (<font color='blue'><b>yeoman</b></font>) looks up at the coach, and just then a pea hits him (<font color='blue'><b>yeoman</b></font>) on the nose, and
some catches his (<font color='blue'><b>yeoman</b></font>) cob behind and makes him (<font color='blue'><b>yeoman</b></font>) dance up on his (<font color='blue'><b>yeoman</b></font>) hind legs. I
see'd the old boy's face flush and look plaguy awkward, and I thought we
was in for somethin’ nasty.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``He (<font color='blue'><b>yeoman</b></font>) turns his (<font color='blue'><b>yeoman</b></font>) cob's head and rides quietly after us just out of shot.
How that `ere cob did step! We never shook him (<font color='blue'><b>yeoman</b></font>) off not a dozen yards
in the six miles. At first the young gents was werry lively on him (<font color='blue'><b>yeoman</b></font>); but
afore we got in, seeing how steady the old chap come on, they was quite
quiet, and laid their heads together what they should do. Some was for
fighting, some for axing his (<font color='blue'><b>chap</b></font>) pardon. He (<font color='blue'><b>chap</b></font>) rides into the town close after
us, comes up when we stops, and says the two as shot at him (<font color='blue'><b>chap</b></font>) must come
before a magistrate; and a great crowd comes round, and we couldn't get
the osses to. But the young uns they all stand by one another, and says
all or none must go, and as how they'd fight it out, and have to be
carried. Just as `twas gettin' serious, and the old boy and the mob was
going to pull `em off the coach, one little fellow jumps up and says,
`Here--I'll stay. I'm only going three miles farther. My father's name's
Davis; he (<font color='blue'><b>Davis</b></font>)'s known about here, and I'll go before the magistrate with
this gentleman.' `What! be thee parson Davis's son?' says the old boy.
`Yes,' says the young un. `Well, I be mortal sorry to meet thee in such
company; but for thy father's sake and thine -LRB-for thee bist a brave
young chap-RRB- I'll say no more about it.' Didn't the boys cheer him (<font color='blue'><b>chap</b></font>), and
the mob cheered the young chap; and then one of the biggest gets down,
and begs his (<font color='blue'><b>chap</b></font>) pardon werry gentlemanly for all the rest, saying as they
all had been plaguy vexed from the first, but didn't like to ax his (<font color='blue'><b>chap</b></font>)
pardon till then, `cause they felt they hadn't ought to shirk the
consequences of their joke. And then they all got down, and shook hands
with the old boy, and asked him (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>) to all parts of the country, to their
homes; and we drives off twenty minutes behind time, with cheering and
hollering as if we was county `members. But, Lor' bless you, sir,''  (<font color='red'><b>the guard</b></font>)</div>says
the guard, smacking his (<font color='blue'><b>guard</b></font>) hand down on his (<font color='blue'><b>guard</b></font>) knee and looking full into
Tom's face, <div class="bookquote">``ten minutes arter they was all as bad as ever.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Tom/Brown/Tom Brown</b></font>)</div><p/>Tom showed such undisguised and open-mouthed interest in his (<font color='blue'><b>Tom</b></font>) narrations
that the old guard rubbed up his (<font color='blue'><b>Tom</b></font>) memory, and launched out into a graphic
history of all the performances of the boys on the roads for the last
twenty years. Off the road he (<font color='blue'><b>Tom</b></font>) couldn't go; the exploit must have been
connected with horses or vehicles to hang in the old fellow's head. Tom
tried him (<font color='blue'><b>Tom</b></font>) off his (<font color='blue'><b>Tom</b></font>) own ground once or twice, but found he (<font color='blue'><b>Tom</b></font>) knew nothing
beyond, and so let him (<font color='blue'><b>Tom</b></font>) have his (<font color='blue'><b>Tom</b></font>) head, and the rest of the road bowled
easily away; for old Blow-hard -LRB-as the boys called him (<font color='blue'><b>Tom</b></font>)-RRB- was a dry old
file, with much kindness and humour, and a capital spinner of a yarn
when he (<font color='blue'><b>Tom</b></font>) had broken the neck of his (<font color='blue'><b>Tom</b></font>) day's work, and got plenty of ale
under his (<font color='blue'><b>Tom</b></font>) belt.

<p/>What struck Tom's youthful imagination most was the desperate and
lawless character of most of the stories. Was the guard hoaxing him (<font color='blue'><b>guard</b></font>)? He (<font color='blue'><b>guard</b></font>)
couldn't help hoping that they were true. It's very odd how almost all
English boys love danger. You can get ten to join a game, or climb a
tree, or swim a stream, when there's a chance of breaking their limbs or
getting drowned, for one who'll stay on level ground, or in his (<font color='blue'><b>guard</b></font>) depth,
or play quoits or bowls.

<p/>The guard had just finished an account of a desperate fight which had
happened at one of the fairs between the drovers and the farmers with
their whips, and the boys with cricket-bats and wickets, which arose out
of a playful but objectionable practice of the boys going round to the
public-houses and taking the linch-pins out of the wheels of the gigs,
and was moralizing upon the way in which the Doctor, <div class="bookquote">``a terrible stern
man he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>)'d heard tell,''  (<font color='red'><b>the Doctor man</b></font>)</div>had come down upon several of the performers,
<div class="bookquote">``sending three on `em off next morning in a po-shay with a parish
constable,''  (<font color='red'><b>the performers</b></font>)</div>when they turned a corner and neared the milestone, the
third from Rugby. By the stone two boys stood, their jackets buttoned
tight, waiting for the coach.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Look here, sir,''  (<font color='red'><b>the guard</b></font>)</div>says the guard, after giving a sharp toot-toot;
<div class="bookquote">``there's two on `em; out-and-out runners they be. They comes out about
twice or three times a week, and spirts a mile alongside of us.''

 (<font color='red'><b>the guard</b></font>)</div><p/>And as they came up, sure enough, away went two boys along the footpath,
keeping up with the horses--the first a light, clean-made fellow going
on springs; the other stout and round-shouldered, labouring in his (<font color='blue'><b>fellow</b></font>) pace,
but going as dogged as a bull-terrier.

<p/>Old Blow-hard looked on admiringly. <div class="bookquote">``See how beautiful that there un
holds hisself together, and goes from his (<font color='blue'><b>constable</b></font>) hips, sir,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>said he (<font color='blue'><b>fellow</b></font>); <div class="bookquote">``he (<font color='blue'><b>constable</b></font>)'s a
`mazin' fine runner. Now many coachmen as drives a first-rate team'd
put it on, and try and pass `em. But Bob, sir, bless you, he (<font color='blue'><b>Bob</b></font>)'s
tender-hearted; he (<font color='blue'><b>Bob</b></font>)'d sooner pull in a bit if he (<font color='blue'><b>Bob</b></font>) see'd `em a-gettin'
beat. I do b'lieve, too, as that there un'd sooner break his (<font color='blue'><b>Bob</b></font>) heart than
let us go by him (<font color='blue'><b>Bob</b></font>) afore next milestone.''

 (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div><p/>At the second milestone the boys pulled up short, and waved their
hats to the guard, who had his (<font color='blue'><b>guard</b></font>) watch out and shouted <div class="bookquote">``4.56,''  (<font color='red'><b>the guard</b></font>)</div>thereby
indicating that the mile had been done in four seconds under the five
minutes. They passed several more parties of boys, all of them objects
of the deepest interest to Tom, and came in sight of the town at ten
minutes before twelve. Tom fetched a long breath, and thought he (<font color='blue'><b>Tom</b></font>) had
never spent a pleasanter day. Before he (<font color='blue'><b>Tom</b></font>) went to bed he (<font color='blue'><b>Tom</b></font>) had quite settled
that it must be the greatest day he (<font color='blue'><b>Tom</b></font>) should ever spend, and didn't alter
his (<font color='blue'><b>Tom</b></font>) opinion for many a long year--if he (<font color='blue'><b>Tom</b></font>) has yet.



<p/>CHAPTER V--RUGBY AND FOOTBALL.


<p/><div class="bookquote">``Foot and eye opposed
In dubious strife.'' (<font color='red'><b>Scott</b></font>)</div>--Scott.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``And so here's Rugby, sir, at last, and you'll be in plenty of time
for dinner at the School-house, as I telled you,''  (<font color='red'><b>the guard</b></font>)</div>said the old guard,
pulling his (<font color='blue'><b>guard</b></font>) horn out of its case and tootle-tooing away, while the
coachman shook up his (<font color='blue'><b>guard</b></font>) horses, and carried them along the side of the
school close, round Dead-man's corner, past the school-gates, and down
the High Street to the Spread Eagle, the wheelers in a spanking trot,
and leaders cantering, in a style which would not have disgraced <div class="bookquote">``Cherry
Bob,''  (<font color='red'><b>leaders</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``ramping, stamping, tearing, swearing Billy Harwood,''  (<font color='red'><b>leaders</b></font>)</div>or any other
of the old coaching heroes.

<p/>Tom's heart beat quick as he (<font color='blue'><b>Tom</b></font>) passed the great schoolfield or close, with
its noble elms, in which several games at football were going on, and
tried to take in at once the long line of gray buildings, beginning
with the chapel, and ending with the School-house, the residence of the
head-master, where the great flag was lazily waving from the highest
round tower. And he (<font color='blue'><b>Tom</b></font>) began already to be proud of being a Rugby boy, as
he (<font color='blue'><b>Tom</b></font>) passed the schoolgates, with the oriel window above, and saw the boys
standing there, looking as if the town belonged to them, and nodding in
a familiar manner to the coachman, as if any one of them would be quite
equal to getting on the box, and working the team down street as well as
he (<font color='blue'><b>Tom</b></font>).

<p/>One of the young heroes, however, ran out from the rest, and scrambled
up behind; where, having righted himself, and nodded to the guard, with
<div class="bookquote">``How do, Jem?''  (<font color='red'><b>the guard</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>guard</b></font>) turned short round to Tom, and after looking him (<font color='blue'><b>Tom</b></font>) over
for a minute, began,--

<p/><div class="bookquote">``I say, you fellow, is your name Brown?''

 (<font color='red'><b>him</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Yes,''  (<font color='red'><b>Tom/Brown/Tom Brown</b></font>)</div>said Tom, in considerable astonishment, glad, however, to have
lighted on some one already who seemed to know him (<font color='blue'><b>Tom</b></font>).

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Ah, I thought so. You know my old aunt, Miss East. She (<font color='blue'><b>aunt</b></font>) lives somewhere
down your way in Berkshire. She (<font color='blue'><b>aunt</b></font>) wrote to me that you were coming to-day,
and asked me to give you a lift.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Tom/Brown/Tom Brown</b></font>)</div><p/>Tom was somewhat inclined to resent the patronizing air of his (<font color='blue'><b>Tom</b></font>) new
friend, a boy of just about his (<font color='blue'><b>Tom</b></font>) own height and age, but gifted with
the most transcendent coolness and assurance, which Tom felt to be
aggravating and hard to bear, but couldn't for the life of him (<font color='blue'><b>Tom</b></font>) help
admiring and envying--especially when young my lord begins hectoring
two or three long loafing fellows, half porter, half stableman, with
a strong touch of the blackguard, and in the end arranges with one of
them, nicknamed Cooey, to carry Tom's luggage up to the School-house for
sixpence.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``And hark `ee, Cooey; it must be up in ten minutes, or no more jobs from
me. Come along, Brown.''  (<font color='red'><b>the potentate</b></font>)</div>And away swaggers the young potentate, with his (<font color='blue'><b>Tom</b></font>)
hands in his (<font color='blue'><b>Tom</b></font>) pockets, and Tom at his (<font color='blue'><b>Tom</b></font>) side.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``All right, sir,''  (<font color='red'><b>Cooey</b></font>)</div>says Cooey, touching his (<font color='blue'><b>Cooey</b></font>) hat, with a leer and a wink
at his (<font color='blue'><b>Cooey</b></font>) companions.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Hullo though,''  (<font color='red'><b>Tom/Brown/Tom Brown</b></font>)</div>says East, pulling up, and taking another look at Tom;
<div class="bookquote">``this'll never do. Haven't you got a hat? We never wear caps here. Only
the louts wear caps. Bless you, if you were to go into the quadrangle
with that thing on, I don't know what'd happen.''  (<font color='red'><b>Tom/Brown/Tom Brown</b></font>)</div>The very idea was quite
beyond young Master East, and he (<font color='blue'><b>Tom</b></font>) looked unutterable things.

<p/>Tom thought his (<font color='blue'><b>Tom</b></font>) cap a very knowing affair, but confessed that he (<font color='blue'><b>Tom</b></font>) had
a hat in his (<font color='blue'><b>Tom</b></font>) hat-box; which was accordingly at once extracted from the
hind-boot, and Tom equipped in his (<font color='blue'><b>Tom</b></font>) go-to-meeting roof, as his (<font color='blue'><b>Tom</b></font>) new friend
called it. But this didn't quite suit his (<font color='blue'><b>Tom</b></font>) fastidious taste in another
minute, being too shiny; so, as they walk up the town, they dive into
Nixon's the hatter's, and Tom is arrayed, to his (<font color='blue'><b>Tom</b></font>) utter astonishment, and
without paying for it, in a regulation cat-skin at seven-and-sixpence,
Nixon undertaking to send the best hat up to the matron's room,
School-house, in half an hour.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``You can send in a note for a tile on Monday, and make it all right, you
know,''  (<font color='red'><b>Mentor</b></font>)</div>said Mentor; <div class="bookquote">``we're allowed two seven-and-sixers a half, besides
what we bring from home.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Mentor</b></font>)</div><p/>Tom by this time began to be conscious of his (<font color='blue'><b>Tom</b></font>) new social position and
dignities, and to luxuriate in the realized ambition of being a public
school-boy at last, with a vested right of spoiling two seven-and-sixers
in half a year.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``You see,''  (<font color='red'><b>friend</b></font>)</div>said his (<font color='blue'><b>Tom</b></font>) friend, as they strolled up towards the
school-gates, in explanation of his (<font color='blue'><b>Tom</b></font>) conduct, <div class="bookquote">``a great deal depends on
how a fellow cuts up at first. If he (<font color='blue'><b>louts</b></font>)'s got nothing odd about him (<font color='blue'><b>louts</b></font>), and
answers straightforward, and holds his (<font color='blue'><b>louts</b></font>) head up, he (<font color='blue'><b>louts</b></font>) gets on. Now, you'll
do very well as to rig, all but that cap. You see I'm doing the handsome
thing by you, because my father knows yours; besides, I want to please
the old lady. She (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) gave me half a sov. this half, and perhaps'll double
it next, if I keep in her (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) good books.''

 (<font color='red'><b>friend</b></font>)</div><p/>There's nothing for candour like a lower-school boy, and East was a
genuine specimen--frank, hearty, and good-natured, well-satisfied with
himself and his (<font color='blue'><b>Tom</b></font>) position, and choke-full of life and spirits, and
all the Rugby prejudices and traditions which he (<font color='blue'><b>Tom</b></font>) had been able to get
together in the long course of one half-year during which he (<font color='blue'><b>Tom</b></font>) had been at
the School-house.

<p/>And Tom, notwithstanding his (<font color='blue'><b>Tom</b></font>) bumptiousness, felt friends with him (<font color='blue'><b>Tom</b></font>) at
once, and began sucking in all his (<font color='blue'><b>Tom</b></font>) ways and prejudices, as fast as he (<font color='blue'><b>Tom</b></font>)
could understand them.

<p/>East was great in the character of cicerone. He (<font color='blue'><b>Tom</b></font>) carried Tom through
the great gates, where were only two or three boys. These satisfied
themselves with the stock questions, <div class="bookquote">``You fellow, what's your name?
Where do you come from? How old are you? Where do you board?''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>and, <div class="bookquote">``What
form are you in?''  (<font color='red'><b>him</b></font>)</div>And so they passed on through the quadrangle and
a small courtyard, upon which looked down a lot of little windows
-LRB-belonging, as his (<font color='blue'><b>Tom</b></font>) guide informed him (<font color='blue'><b>Tom</b></font>), to some of the School-house
studies-RRB-, into the matron's room, where East introduced Tom to that
dignitary; made him (<font color='blue'><b>Tom</b></font>) give up the key of his (<font color='blue'><b>Tom</b></font>) trunk, that the matron might
unpack his (<font color='blue'><b>Tom</b></font>) linen, and told the story of the hat and of his (<font color='blue'><b>Tom</b></font>) own presence
of mind: upon the relation whereof the matron laughingly scolded him (<font color='blue'><b>Tom</b></font>) for
the coolest new boy in the house; and East, indignant at the accusation
of newness, marched Tom off into the quadrangle, and began showing
him (<font color='blue'><b>Tom</b></font>) the schools, and examining him (<font color='blue'><b>Tom</b></font>) as to his (<font color='blue'><b>Tom</b></font>) literary attainments; the
result of which was a prophecy that they would be in the same form, and
could do their lessons together.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``And now come in and see my study--we shall have just time before
dinner; and afterwards, before calling over, we'll do the close.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Tom/Brown/Tom Brown</b></font>)</div><p/>Tom followed his (<font color='blue'><b>Tom</b></font>) guide through the School-house hall, which opens into
the quadrangle. It is a great room, thirty feet long and eighteen high,
or thereabouts, with two great tables running the whole length, and
two large fireplaces at the side, with blazing fires in them, at one of
which some dozen boys were standing and lounging, some of whom shouted
to East to stop; but he (<font color='blue'><b>Tom</b></font>) shot through with his (<font color='blue'><b>Tom</b></font>) convoy, and landed him (<font color='blue'><b>Tom</b></font>)
in the long, dark passages, with a large fire at the end of each, upon
which the studies opened. Into one of these, in the bottom passage, East
bolted with our hero, slamming and bolting the door behind them, in
case of pursuit from the hall, and Tom was for the first time in a Rugby
boy's citadel.

<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Tom</b></font>) hadn't been prepared for separate studies, and was not a little
astonished and delighted with the palace in question.

<p/>It wasn't very large, certainly, being about six feet long by four
broad. It couldn't be called light, as there were bars and a grating to
the window; which little precautions were necessary in the studies on
the ground-floor looking out into the close, to prevent the exit of
small boys after locking up, and the entrance of contraband articles.
But it was uncommonly comfortable to look at, Tom thought. The space
under the window at the farther end was occupied by a square table
covered with a reasonably clean and whole red and blue check tablecloth;
a hard-seated sofa covered with red stuff occupied one side, running up
to the end, and making a seat for one, or by sitting close, for two, at
the table and a good stout wooden chair afforded a seat to another boy,
so that three could sit and work together. The walls were wainscoted
half-way up, the wainscot being covered with green baize, the remainder
with a bright-patterned paper, on which hung three or four prints of
dogs' heads; Grimaldi winning the Aylesbury steeple-chase; Amy Robsart,
the reigning Waverley beauty of the day; and Tom Crib, in a posture
of defence, which did no credit to the science of that hero, if truly
represented. Over the door were a row of hat-pegs, and on each side
bookcases with cupboards at the bottom, shelves and cupboards being
filled indiscriminately with school-books, a cup or two, a
mouse-trap and candlesticks, leather straps, a fustian bag, and some
curious-looking articles which puzzled Tom not a little, until his (<font color='blue'><b>Tom</b></font>)
friend explained that they were climbing-irons, and showed their use. A
cricket-bat and small fishing-rod stood up in one corner.

<p/>This was the residence of East and another boy in the same form, and had
more interest for Tom than Windsor Castle, or any other residence in
the British Isles. For was he (<font color='blue'><b>Tom</b></font>) not about to become the joint owner of a
similar home, the first place he (<font color='blue'><b>Tom</b></font>) could call his (<font color='blue'><b>Tom</b></font>) own? One's own! What a
charm there is in the words! How long it takes boy and man to find
out their worth! How fast most of us hold on to them--faster and more
jealously, the nearer we are to that general home into which we can
take nothing, but must go naked as we came into the world! When shall we
learn that he (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>) who multiplieth possessions multiplieth troubles, and that
the one single use of things which we call our own is that they may be
his (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>) who hath need of them?

<p/><div class="bookquote">``And shall I have a study like this too?''  (<font color='red'><b>Tom/Brown/Tom Brown</b></font>)</div>said Tom.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Yes, of course; you'll be chummed with some fellow on Monday, and you
can sit here till then.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``What nice places!''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``They're well enough,''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>answered East, patronizingly, <div class="bookquote">``only uncommon cold
at nights sometimes. Gower--that's my chum--and I make a fire with paper
on the floor after supper generally, only that makes it so smoky.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``But there's a big fire out in the passage,''  (<font color='red'><b>Tom/Brown/Tom Brown</b></font>)</div>said Tom.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Precious little we get out of that, though,''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>said East. <div class="bookquote">``Jones the
praepostor has the study at the fire end, and he (<font color='blue'><b>Jones</b></font>) has rigged up an iron
rod and green baize curtain across the passage, which he (<font color='blue'><b>Jones</b></font>) draws at night,
and sits there with his (<font color='blue'><b>Jones</b></font>) door open; so he (<font color='blue'><b>Jones</b></font>) gets all the fire, and hears if
we come out of our studies after eight, or make a noise. However, he (<font color='blue'><b>Jones</b></font>)'s
taken to sitting in the fifth-form room lately, so we do get a bit of
fire now sometimes; only to keep a sharp lookout that he (<font color='blue'><b>Jones</b></font>) don't catch you
behind his (<font color='blue'><b>Jones</b></font>) curtain when he (<font color='blue'><b>Jones</b></font>) comes down--that's all.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/>A quarter past one now struck, and the bell began tolling for dinner; so
they went into the hall and took their places, Tom at the very bottom
of the second table, next to the praepostor -LRB-who sat at the end to keep
order there-RRB-, and East a few paces higher. And now Tom for the first
time saw his (<font color='blue'><b>Tom</b></font>) future school-fellows in a body. In they came, some hot
and ruddy from football or long walks, some pale and chilly from hard
reading in their studies, some from loitering over the fire at
the pastrycook's, dainty mortals, bringing with them pickles and
saucebottles to help them with their dinners. And a great big-bearded
man, whom Tom took for a master, began calling over the names, while the
great joints were being rapidly carved on the third table in the
corner by the old verger and the housekeeper. Tom's turn came last, and
meanwhile he (<font color='blue'><b>Tom</b></font>) was all eyes, looking first with awe at the great man, who
sat close to him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>), and was helped first, and who read a hard-looking book
all the time he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) was eating; and when he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) got up and walked off to the
fire, at the small boys round him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>), some of whom were reading, and the
rest talking in whispers to one another, or stealing one another's
bread, or shooting pellets, or digging their forks through the
tablecloth. However, notwithstanding his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) curiosity, he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) managed to make
a capital dinner by the time the big man called <div class="bookquote">``Stand up!''  (<font color='red'><b>the man</b></font>)</div>and said
grace.

<p/>As soon as dinner was over, and Tom had been questioned by such of his (<font color='blue'><b>Tom</b></font>)
neighbours as were curious as to his (<font color='blue'><b>Tom</b></font>) birth, parentage, education, and
other like matters, East, who evidently enjoyed his (<font color='blue'><b>Tom</b></font>) new dignity of
patron and mentor, proposed having a look at the close, which Tom,
athirst for knowledge, gladly assented to; and they went out through the
quadrangle and past the big fives court, into the great playground.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``That's the chapel, you see,''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>said East; <div class="bookquote">``and there, just behind it, is
the place for fights. You see it's most out of the way of the masters,
who all live on the other side, and don't come by here after first
lesson or callings-over. That's when the fights come off. And all this
part where we are is the little-side ground, right up to the trees; and
on the other side of the trees is the big-side ground, where the great
matches are played. And there's the island in the farthest corner;
you'll know that well enough next half, when there's island fagging. I
say, it's horrid cold; let's have a run across.''  (<font color='red'><b>Tom/Brown/Tom Brown</b></font>)</div>And away went East, Tom
close behind him (<font color='blue'><b>Tom</b></font>). East was evidently putting his (<font color='blue'><b>Tom</b></font>) best foot foremost; and
Tom, who was mighty proud of his (<font color='blue'><b>Tom</b></font>) running, and not a little anxious
to show his (<font color='blue'><b>Tom</b></font>) friend that, although a new boy, he (<font color='blue'><b>Tom</b></font>) was no milksop, laid
himself down to work in his (<font color='blue'><b>Tom</b></font>) very best style. Right across the close they
went, each doing all he (<font color='blue'><b>Tom</b></font>) knew, and there wasn't a yard between them when
they pulled up at the island moat.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``I say,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>said East, as soon as he (<font color='blue'><b>Tom</b></font>) got his (<font color='blue'><b>Tom</b></font>) wind, looking with much
increased respect at Tom, <div class="bookquote">``you ain't a bad scud, not by no means. Well,
I'm as warm as a toast now.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Tom/Brown/Tom Brown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``But why do you wear white trousers in November?''  (<font color='red'><b>Tom/Brown/Tom Brown</b></font>)</div>said Tom. He (<font color='blue'><b>Tom</b></font>) had been
struck by this peculiarity in the costume of almost all the School-house
boys.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Why, bless us, don't you know? No; I forgot. Why, to-day's the
School-house match. Our house plays the whole of the School at football.
And we all wear white trousers, to show `em we don't care for hacks.
You're in luck to come to-day. You just will see a match; and Brooke's
going to let me play in quarters. That's more than he (<font color='blue'><b>I</b></font>)'ll do for any
other lower-school boy, except James, and he (<font color='blue'><b>James</b></font>)'s fourteen.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Who's Brooke?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Why, that big fellow who called over at dinner, to be sure. He (<font color='blue'><b>fellow</b></font>)'s cock
of the school, and head of the School-house side, and the best kick and
charger in Rugby.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Oh, but do show me where they play. And tell me about it. I love
football so, and have played all my life. Won't Brooke let me play?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Not he (<font color='blue'><b>fellow</b></font>),''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>said East, with some indignation. <div class="bookquote">``Why, you don't know the
rules; you'll be a month learning them. And then it's no joke playing-up
in a match, I can tell you--quite another thing from your private school
games. Why, there's been two collar-bones broken this half, and a dozen
fellows lamed. And last year a fellow had his (<font color='blue'><b>fellow</b></font>) leg broken.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Tom/Brown/Tom Brown</b></font>)</div><p/>Tom listened with the profoundest respect to this chapter of accidents,
and followed East across the level ground till they came to a sort of
gigantic gallows of two poles, eighteen feet high, fixed upright in the
ground some fourteen feet apart, with a cross-bar running from one to
the other at the height of ten feet or thereabouts.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``This is one of the goals,''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>said East, <div class="bookquote">``and you see the other, across
there, right opposite, under the Doctor's wall. Well, the match is for
the best of three goals; whichever side kicks two goals wins: and it
won't do, you see, just to kick the ball through these posts--it must go
over the cross-bar; any height'll do, so long as it's between the posts.
You'll have to stay in goal to touch the ball when it rolls behind the
posts, because if the other side touch it they have a try at goal. Then
we fellows in quarters, we play just about in front of goal here, and
have to turn the ball and kick it back before the big fellows on the
other side can follow it up. And in front of us all the big fellows
play, and that's where the scrummages are mostly.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Tom/Brown/Tom Brown</b></font>)</div><p/>Tom's respect increased as he (<font color='blue'><b>Tom</b></font>) struggled to make out his (<font color='blue'><b>Tom</b></font>) friend's
technicalities, and the other set to work to explain the mysteries
of <div class="bookquote">``off your side,''  (<font color='red'><b>friend</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``drop-kicks,''  (<font color='red'><b>friend</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``punts,''  (<font color='red'><b>friend</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``places,''  (<font color='red'><b>friend</b></font>)</div>and the other
intricacies of the great science of football.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``But how do you keep the ball between the goals?''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>said he (<font color='blue'><b>Tom</b></font>); <div class="bookquote">``I can't see
why it mightn't go right down to the chapel.''

 (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Why; that's out of play,''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>answered East. <div class="bookquote">``You see this gravel-walk
running down all along this side of the playing-ground, and the line
of elms opposite on the other? Well, they're the bounds. As soon as the
ball gets past them, it's in touch, and out of play. And then whoever
first touches it has to knock it straight out amongst the players-up,
who make two lines with a space between them, every fellow going on his (<font color='blue'><b>fellow</b></font>)
own side. Ain't there just fine scrummages then! And the three trees you
see there which come out into the play, that's a tremendous place when
the ball hangs there, for you get thrown against the trees, and that's
worse than any hack.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Tom/Brown/Tom Brown</b></font>)</div><p/>Tom wondered within himself, as they strolled back again towards the
fives court, whether the matches were really such break-neck affairs as
East represented, and whether, if they were, he (<font color='blue'><b>Tom</b></font>) should ever get to like
them and play up well.

<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Tom</b></font>) hadn't long to wonder, however, for next minute East cried out,
<div class="bookquote">``Hurrah! here's the punt-about; come along and try your hand at a kick.''
 (<font color='red'><b>He</b></font>)</div>The punt-about is the practice-ball, which is just brought out and
kicked about anyhow from one boy to another before callings-over and
dinner, and at other odd times. They joined the boys who had brought it
out, all small School-house fellows, friends of East; and Tom had the
pleasure of trying his (<font color='blue'><b>Tom</b></font>) skill, and performed very creditably, after first
driving his (<font color='blue'><b>Tom</b></font>) foot three inches into the ground, and then nearly kicking
his (<font color='blue'><b>Tom</b></font>) leg into the air, in vigorous efforts to accomplish a drop-kick
after the manner of East.

<p/>Presently more boys and bigger came out, and boys from other houses
on their way to calling-over, and more balls were sent for. The crowd
thickened as three o’clock approached; and when the hour struck, one
hundred and fifty boys were hard at work. Then the balls were held, the
master of the week came down in cap and gown to calling-over, and the
whole school of three hundred boys swept into the big school to answer
to their names.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``I may come in, mayn't I?''  (<font color='red'><b>Tom/Brown/Tom Brown</b></font>)</div>said Tom, catching East by the arm, and
longing to feel one of them.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Yes, come along; nobody'll say anything. You won't be so eager to get
into calling-over after a month,''  (<font color='red'><b>friend</b></font>)</div>replied his (<font color='blue'><b>Tom</b></font>) friend; and they marched
into the big school together, and up to the farther end, where that
illustrious form, the lower fourth, which had the honour of East's
patronage for the time being, stood.

<p/>The master mounted into the high desk by the door, and one of the
praepostors of the week stood by him (<font color='blue'><b>master</b></font>) on the steps, the other three
marching up and down the middle of the school with their canes, calling
out, <div class="bookquote">``Silence, silence!''  (<font color='red'><b>him</b></font>)</div>The sixth form stood close by the door on the
left, some thirty in number, mostly great big grown men, as Tom thought,
surveying them from a distance with awe; the fifth form behind them,
twice their number, and not quite so big. These on the left; and on the
right the lower fifth, shell, and all the junior forms in order; while
up the middle marched the three praepostors.

<p/>Then the praepostor who stands by the master calls out the names,
beginning with the sixth form; and as he (<font color='blue'><b>master</b></font>) calls each boy answers <div class="bookquote">``here''
 (<font color='red'><b>each boy</b></font>)</div>to his (<font color='blue'><b>master</b></font>) name, and walks out. Some of the sixth stop at the door to turn
the whole string of boys into the close. It is a great match-day, and
every boy in the school, will he (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>), nill he (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>), must be there. The rest of
the sixth go forwards into the close, to see that no one escapes by any
of the side gates.

<p/>To-day, however, being the School-house match, none of the School-house
praepostors stay by the door to watch for truants of their side; there
is carte blanche to the School-house fags to go where they like. <div class="bookquote">``They
trust to our honour,''  (<font color='red'><b>Tom/Brown/Tom Brown</b></font>)</div>as East proudly informs Tom; <div class="bookquote">``they know very well
that no School-house boy would cut the match. If he (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>) did, we'd very soon
cut him (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>), I can tell you.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Tom/Brown/Tom Brown</b></font>)</div><p/>The master of the week being short-sighted, and the praepostors of the
week small and not well up to their work, the lower-school boys employ
the ten minutes which elapse before their names are called in pelting
one another vigorously with acorns, which fly about in all directions.
The small praepostors dash in every now and then, and generally chastise
some quiet, timid boy who is equally afraid of acorns and canes,
while the principal performers get dexterously out of the way. And so
calling-over rolls on somehow, much like the big world, punishments
lighting on wrong shoulders, and matters going generally in a queer,
cross-grained way, but the end coming somehow, which is, after all, the
great point. And now the master of the week has finished, and locked up
the big school; and the praepostors of the week come out, sweeping the
last remnant of the school fags, who had been loafing about the corners
by the fives court, in hopes of a chance of bolting, before them into
the close.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Hold the punt-about!''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``To the goals!''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>are the cries; and all stray
balls are impounded by the authorities, and the whole mass of boys moves
up towards the two goals, dividing as they go into three bodies. That
little band on the left, consisting of from fifteen to twenty boys, Tom
amongst them, who are making for the goal under the School-house wall,
are the School-house boys who are not to play up, and have to stay in
goal. The larger body moving to the island goal are the School boys in a
like predicament. The great mass in the middle are the players-up, both
sides mingled together; they are hanging their jackets -LRB-and all who mean
real work-RRB-, their hats, waistcoats, neck-handkerchiefs, and braces, on
the railings round the small trees; and there they go by twos and
threes up to their respective grounds. There is none of the colour and
tastiness of get-up, you will perceive, which lends such a life to
the present game at Rugby, making the dullest and worst-fought match a
pretty sight. Now each house has its own uniform of cap and jersey, of
some lively colour; but at the time we are speaking of plush caps have
not yet come in, or uniforms of any sort, except the School-house
white trousers, which are abominably cold to-day. Let us get to work,
bare-headed, and girded with our plain leather straps. But we mean
business, gentlemen.

<p/>And now that the two sides have fairly sundered, and each occupies its
own ground, and we get a good look at them, what absurdity is this? You
don't mean to say that those fifty or sixty boys in white trousers, many
of them quite small, are going to play that huge mass opposite? Indeed I
do, gentlemen. They're going to try, at any rate, and won't make such
a bad fight of it either, mark my word; for hasn't old Brooke won the
toss, with his (<font color='blue'><b>its</b></font>) lucky halfpenny, and got choice of goals and kick-off?
The new ball you may see lie there quite by itself, in the middle,
pointing towards the School or island goal; in another minute it will be
well on its way there. Use that minute in remarking how the Schoolhouse
side is drilled. You will see, in the first place, that the sixth-form
boy, who has the charge of goal, has spread his (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>) force -LRB-the goalkeepers-RRB-
so as to occupy the whole space behind the goal-posts, at distances of
about five yards apart. A safe and well-kept goal is the foundation of
all good play. Old Brooke is talking to the captain of quarters, and
now he (<font color='blue'><b>captain</b></font>) moves away. See how that youngster spreads his (<font color='blue'><b>youngster</b></font>) men -LRB-the light
brigade-RRB- carefully over the ground, half-way between their own goal and
the body of their own players-up -LRB-the heavy brigade-RRB-. These again play
in several bodies. There is young Brooke and the bull-dogs. Mark them
well. They are the <div class="bookquote">``fighting brigade,''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>the <div class="bookquote">``die-hards,''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>larking about
at leap-frog to keep themselves warm, and playing tricks on one another.
And on each side of old Brooke, who is now standing in the middle of
the ground and just going to kick off, you see a separate wing of
players-up, each with a boy of acknowledged prowess to look to--here
Warner, and there Hedge; but over all is old Brooke, absolute as he (<font color='blue'><b>Warner</b></font>)
of Russia, but wisely and bravely ruling over willing and worshipping
subjects, a true football king. His (<font color='blue'><b>king</b></font>) face is earnest and careful as he (<font color='blue'><b>king</b></font>)
glances a last time over his (<font color='blue'><b>king</b></font>) array, but full of pluck and hope--the sort
of look I hope to see in my general when I go out to fight.

<p/>The School side is not organized in the same way. The goal-keepers
are all in lumps, anyhow and nohow; you can't distinguish between the
players-up and the boys in quarters, and there is divided leadership.
But with such odds in strength and weight it must take more than that to
hinder them from winning; and so their leaders seem to think, for they
let the players-up manage themselves.

<p/>But now look! there is a slight move forward of the School-house wings,
a shout of <div class="bookquote">``Are you ready?''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>and loud affirmative reply. Old Brooke takes
half a dozen quick steps, and away goes the ball spinning towards the
School goal, seventy yards before it touches ground, and at no
point above twelve or fifteen feet high, a model kick-off; and the
School-house cheer and rush on. The ball is returned, and they meet it
and drive it back amongst the masses of the School already in motion.
Then the two sides close, and you can see nothing for minutes but a
swaying crowd of boys, at one point violently agitated. That is where
the ball is, and there are the keen players to be met, and the glory and
the hard knocks to be got. You hear the dull thud, thud of the ball, and
the shouts of <div class="bookquote">``Off your side,''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``Down with him (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>),''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``Put him (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>) over,''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``Bravo.''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>This is what we call <div class="bookquote">``a scrummage,''  (<font color='red'><b>gentlemen joke</b></font>)</div>gentlemen, and the first scrummage
in a School-house match was no joke in the consulship of Plancus.

<p/>But see! it has broken; the ball is driven out on the School-house side,
and a rush of the School carries it past the School-house players-up.
<div class="bookquote">``Look out in quarters,''  (<font color='red'><b>Brooke</b></font>)</div>Brooke's and twenty other voices ring out. No
need to call, though: the School-house captain of quarters has caught it
on the bound, dodges the foremost School boys, who are heading the rush,
and sends it back with a good drop-kick well into the enemy's country.
And then follows rush upon rush, and scrummage upon scrummage, the ball
now driven through into the School-house quarters, and now into the
School goal; for the School-house have not lost the advantage which the
kick-off and a slight wind gave them at the outset, and are slightly
<div class="bookquote">``penning''  (<font color='red'><b>adversaries</b></font>)</div>their adversaries. You say you don't see much in it
all--nothing but a struggling mass of boys, and a leather ball which
seems to excite them all to great fury, as a red rag does a bull. My
dear sir, a battle would look much the same to you, except that the
boys would be men, and the balls iron; but a battle would be worth
your looking at for all that, and so is a football match. You can't be
expected to appreciate the delicate strokes of play, the turns by which
a game is lost and won--it takes an old player to do that; but the broad
philosophy of football you can understand if you will. Come along with
me a little nearer, and let us consider it together.

<p/>The ball has just fallen again where the two sides are thickest, and
they close rapidly around it in a scrummage. It must be driven through
now by force or skill, till it flies out on one side or the other.
Look how differently the boys face it! Here come two of the bulldogs,
bursting through the outsiders; in they go, straight to the heart of the
scrummage, bent on driving that ball out on the opposite side. That is
what they mean to do. My sons, my sons! you are too hot; you have gone
past the ball, and must struggle now right through the scrummage, and
get round and back again to your own side, before you can be of any
further use. Here comes young Brooke; he (<font color='blue'><b>outsiders</b></font>) goes in as straight as you, but
keeps his (<font color='blue'><b>outsiders</b></font>) head, and backs and bends, holding himself still behind the
ball, and driving it furiously when he (<font color='blue'><b>outsiders</b></font>) gets the chance. Take a leaf out
of his (<font color='blue'><b>outsiders</b></font>) book, you young chargers. Here comes Speedicut, and Flashman the
School-house bully, with shouts and great action. Won't you two come up
to young Brooke, after locking-up, by the School-house fire, with <div class="bookquote">``Old
fellow, wasn't that just a splendid scrummage by the three trees?''  (<font color='red'><b>Brooke</b></font>)</div>But
he (<font color='blue'><b>bully</b></font>) knows you, and so do we. You don't really want to drive that
ball through that scrummage, chancing all hurt for the glory of the
School-house, but to make us think that's what you want--a vastly
different thing; and fellows of your kidney will never go through more
than the skirts of a scrummage, where it's all push and no kicking. We
respect boys who keep out of it, and don't sham going in; but you--we
had rather not say what we think of you.

<p/>Then the boys who are bending and watching on the outside, mark them:
they are most useful players, the dodgers, who seize on the ball the
moment it rolls out from amongst the chargers, and away with it across
to the opposite goal. They seldom go into the scrummage, but must have
more coolness than the chargers. As endless as are boys' characters, so
are their ways of facing or not facing a scrummage at football.

<p/>Three-quarters of an hour are gone; first winds are failing, and weight
and numbers beginning to tell. Yard by yard the School-house have been
driven back, contesting every inch of ground. The bull-dogs are the
colour of mother earth from shoulder to ankle, except young Brooke, who
has a marvellous knack of keeping his (<font color='blue'><b>characters</b></font>) legs. The School-house are being
penned in their turn, and now the ball is behind their goal, under the
Doctor's wall. The Doctor and some of his (<font color='blue'><b>Doctor</b></font>) family are there looking on,
and seem as anxious as any boy for the success of the School-house. We
get a minute's breathing-time before old Brooke kicks out, and he (<font color='blue'><b>Doctor</b></font>) gives
the word to play strongly for touch, by the three trees. Away goes the
ball, and the bull-dogs after it, and in another minute there is shout
of <div class="bookquote">``In touch!''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``Our ball!''  (<font color='red'><b>Brooke</b></font>)</div>Now's your time, old Brooke, while your men
are still fresh. He (<font color='blue'><b>Doctor</b></font>) stands with the ball in his (<font color='blue'><b>Doctor</b></font>) hand, while the two
sides form in deep lines opposite one another; he (<font color='blue'><b>Doctor</b></font>) must strike it
straight out between them. The lines are thickest close to him (<font color='blue'><b>Doctor</b></font>), but
young Brooke and two or three of his (<font color='blue'><b>Doctor</b></font>) men are shifting up farther,
where the opposite line is weak. Old Brooke strikes it out straight and
strong, and it falls opposite his (<font color='blue'><b>Doctor</b></font>) brother. Hurrah! that rush has taken
it right through the School line, and away past the three trees, far
into their quarters, and young Brooke and the bull-dogs are close upon
it. The School leaders rush back, shouting, <div class="bookquote">``Look out in goal!''  (<font color='red'><b>The School leaders</b></font>)</div>and
strain every nerve to catch him (<font color='blue'><b>Doctor</b></font>), but they are after the fleetest foot
in Rugby. There they go straight for the School goal-posts, quarters
scattering before them. One after another the bull-dogs go down, but
young Brooke holds on. <div class="bookquote">``He (<font color='blue'><b>fellow</b></font>) is down.''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>No! a long stagger, but the danger
is past. That was the shock of Crew, the most dangerous of dodgers. And
now he (<font color='blue'><b>Doctor</b></font>) is close to the School goal, the ball not three yards before
him (<font color='blue'><b>Doctor</b></font>). There is a hurried rush of the School fags to the spot, but no
one throws himself on the ball, the only chance, and young Brooke has
touched it right under the School goal-posts.

<p/>The School leaders come up furious, and administer toco to the wretched
fags nearest at hand. They may well be angry, for it is all Lombard
Street to a china orange that the School-house kick a goal with the ball
touched in such a good place. Old Brooke, of course, will kick it
out, but who shall catch and place it? Call Crab Jones. Here he (<font color='blue'><b>Jones</b></font>) comes,
sauntering along with a straw in his (<font color='blue'><b>Jones</b></font>) mouth, the queerest, coolest fish
in Rugby. If he (<font color='blue'><b>Jones</b></font>) were tumbled into the moon this minute, he (<font color='blue'><b>Jones</b></font>) would just
pick himself up without taking his (<font color='blue'><b>Jones</b></font>) hands out of his (<font color='blue'><b>Jones</b></font>) pockets or turning
a hair. But it is a moment when the boldest charger's heart beats quick.
Old Brooke stands with the ball under his (<font color='blue'><b>Jones</b></font>) arm motioning the School back;
he (<font color='blue'><b>Jones</b></font>) will not kick out till they are all in goal, behind the posts. They
are all edging forwards, inch by inch, to get nearer for the rush at
Crab Jones, who stands there in front of old Brooke to catch the ball.
If they can reach and destroy him (<font color='blue'><b>Jones</b></font>) before he (<font color='blue'><b>Jones</b></font>) catches, the danger is over;
and with one and the same rush they will carry it right away to the
School-house goal. Fond hope! it is kicked out and caught beautifully.
Crab strikes his (<font color='blue'><b>Jones</b></font>) heel into the ground, to mark the spot where the ball
was caught, beyond which the school line may not advance; but there they
stand, five deep, ready to rush the moment the ball touches the ground.
Take plenty of room. Don't give the rush a chance of reaching you. Place
it true and steady. Trust Crab Jones. He (<font color='blue'><b>Jones</b></font>) has made a small hole with his (<font color='blue'><b>Jones</b></font>)
heel for the ball to lie on, by which he (<font color='blue'><b>Jones</b></font>) is resting on one knee, with
his (<font color='blue'><b>Jones</b></font>) eye on old Brooke. <div class="bookquote">``Now!''  (<font color='red'><b>Brooke</b></font>)</div>Crab places the ball at the word, old
Brooke kicks, and it rises slowly and truly as the School rush forward.

<p/>Then a moment's pause, while both sides look up at the spinning ball.
There it flies, straight between the two posts, some five feet above the
cross-bar, an unquestioned goal; and a shout of real, genuine joy rings
out from the School-house players-up, and a faint echo of it comes over
the close from the goal-keepers under the Doctor's wall. A goal in the
first hour--such a thing hasn't been done in the School-house match
these five years.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Over!''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>is the cry. The two sides change goals, and the School-house
goal-keepers come threading their way across through the masses of
the School, the most openly triumphant of them--amongst whom is Tom, a
School-house boy of two hours' standing--getting their ears boxed in
the transit. Tom indeed is excited beyond measure, and it is all the
sixth-form boy, kindest and safest of goal-keepers, has been able to do,
to keep him (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>) from rushing out whenever the ball has been near their
goal. So he (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>) holds him (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>) by his (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>) side, and instructs him (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>) in the science of
touching.

<p/>At this moment Griffith, the itinerant vender of oranges from Hill
Morton, enters the close with his (<font color='blue'><b>Griffith</b></font>) heavy baskets. There is a rush of
small boys upon the little pale-faced man, the two sides mingling
together, subdued by the great goddess Thirst, like the English and
French by the streams in the Pyrenees. The leaders are past oranges and
apples, but some of them visit their coats, and apply innocent-looking
ginger-beer bottles to their mouths. It is no ginger-beer though, I
fear, and will do you no good. One short mad rush, and then a stitch in
the side, and no more honest play. That's what comes of those bottles.

<p/>But now Griffith's baskets are empty, the ball is placed again midway,
and the School are going to kick off. Their leaders have sent their
lumber into goal, and rated the rest soundly, and one hundred and twenty
picked players-up are there, bent on retrieving the game. They are to
keep the ball in front of the School-house goal, and then to drive it in
by sheer strength and weight. They mean heavy play and no mistake, and
so old Brooke sees, and places Crab Jones in quarters just before the
goal, with four or five picked players who are to keep the ball away to
the sides, where a try at goal, if obtained, will be less dangerous than
in front. He (<font color='blue'><b>Jones</b></font>) himself, and Warner and Hedge, who have saved themselves
till now, will lead the charges.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Are you ready?''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``Yes.''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>And away comes the ball, kicked high in the air,
to give the School time to rush on and catch it as it falls. And here
they are amongst us. Meet them like Englishmen, you Schoolhouse boys,
and charge them home. Now is the time to show what mettle is in you;
and there shall be a warm seat by the hall fire, and honour, and lots of
bottled beer to-night for him (<font color='blue'><b>Jones</b></font>) who does his (<font color='blue'><b>Jones</b></font>) duty in the next half-hour.
And they are well met. Again and again the cloud of their players-up
gathers before our goal, and comes threatening on, and Warner or Hedge,
with young Brooke and the relics of the bull-dogs, break through
and carry the ball back; and old Brooke ranges the field like Job's
war-horse. The thickest scrummage parts asunder before his (<font color='blue'><b>Warner</b></font>) rush, like
the waves before a clipper's bows; his (<font color='blue'><b>Warner</b></font>) cheery voice rings out over the
field, and his (<font color='blue'><b>Warner</b></font>) eye is everywhere. And if these miss the ball, and it
rolls dangerously in front of our goal, Crab Jones and his (<font color='blue'><b>Jones</b></font>) men
have seized it and sent it away towards the sides with the unerring
drop-kick. This is worth living for--the whole sum of school-boy
existence gathered up into one straining, struggling half-hour, a
half-hour worth a year of common life.

<p/>The quarter to five has struck, and the play slackens for a minute
before goal; but there is Crew, the artful dodger, driving the ball in
behind our goal, on the island side, where our quarters are weakest. Is
there no one to meet him (<font color='blue'><b>Jones</b></font>)? Yes; look at little East! The ball is just at
equal distances between the two, and they rush together, the young man
of seventeen and the boy of twelve, and kick it at the same moment. Crew
passes on without a stagger; East is hurled forward by the shock, and
plunges on his (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>) shoulder, as if he (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>) would bury himself in the ground;
but the ball rises straight into the air, and falls behind Crew's back,
while the <div class="bookquote">``bravoes''  (<font color='red'><b>Crew</b></font>)</div>of the School-house attest the pluckiest charge of
all that hard-fought day. Warner picks East up lame and half stunned,
and he (<font color='blue'><b>Warner</b></font>) hobbles back into goal, conscious of having played the man.

<p/>And now the last minutes are come, and the School gather for their last
rush, every boy of the hundred and twenty who has a run left in him (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>).
Reckless of the defence of their own goal, on they come across the level
big-side ground, the ball well down amongst them, straight for our goal,
like the column of the Old Guard up the slope at Waterloo. All former
charges have been child's play to this. Warner and Hedge have met them,
but still on they come. The bull-dogs rush in for the last time; they
are hurled over or carried back, striving hand, foot, and eyelids. Old
Brooke comes sweeping round the skirts of the play, and turning short
round, picks out the very heart of the scrummage, and plunges in. It
wavers for a moment; he (<font color='blue'><b>Warner</b></font>) has the ball. No, it has passed him (<font color='blue'><b>Warner</b></font>), and his (<font color='blue'><b>Warner</b></font>)
voice rings out clear over the advancing tide, <div class="bookquote">``Look out in goal!''  (<font color='red'><b>him</b></font>)</div>Crab
Jones catches it for a moment; but before he (<font color='blue'><b>Jones</b></font>) can kick, the rush is upon
him (<font color='blue'><b>Jones</b></font>) and passes over him (<font color='blue'><b>Jones</b></font>); and he (<font color='blue'><b>Jones</b></font>) picks himself up behind them with his (<font color='blue'><b>Jones</b></font>)
straw in his (<font color='blue'><b>Jones</b></font>) mouth, a little dirtier, but as cool as ever.

<p/>The ball rolls slowly in behind the School-house goal, not three yards
in front of a dozen of the biggest School players-up.

<p/>There stands the School-house praepostor, safest of goal-keepers, and Tom
Brown by his (<font color='blue'><b>Brown</b></font>) side, who has learned his (<font color='blue'><b>Brown</b></font>) trade by this time. Now is
your time, Tom. The blood of all the Browns is up, and the two rush in
together, and throw themselves on the ball, under the very feet of the
advancing column--the praepostor on his (<font color='blue'><b>Tom</b></font>) hands and knees, arching his (<font color='blue'><b>Tom</b></font>)
back, and Tom all along on his (<font color='blue'><b>Tom</b></font>) face. Over them topple the leaders of the
rush, shooting over the back of the praepostor, but falling flat on Tom,
and knocking all the wind out of his (<font color='blue'><b>Tom</b></font>) small carcass. <div class="bookquote">``Our ball,''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>says the
praepostor, rising with his (<font color='blue'><b>Tom</b></font>) prize; <div class="bookquote">``but get up there; there's a little
fellow under you.''  (<font color='red'><b>him</b></font>)</div>They are hauled and roll off him (<font color='blue'><b>Tom</b></font>), and Tom is
discovered, a motionless body.

<p/>Old Brooke picks him (<font color='blue'><b>Tom</b></font>) up. <div class="bookquote">``Stand back, give him (<font color='blue'><b>fellow</b></font>) air,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Tom</b></font>) says; and then
feeling his (<font color='blue'><b>Tom</b></font>) limbs, adds, <div class="bookquote">``No bones broken.--How do you feel, young un?''

 (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Hah-hah!''  (<font color='red'><b>Tom/Brown/Tom Brown</b></font>)</div>gasps Tom, as his (<font color='blue'><b>Tom</b></font>) wind comes back; <div class="bookquote">``pretty well, thank
you--all right.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Tom/Brown/Tom Brown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Who is he (<font color='blue'><b>fellow</b></font>)?''  (<font color='red'><b>Brooke</b></font>)</div>says Brooke.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Oh, it's Brown; he (<font color='blue'><b>Brown</b></font>)'s a new boy; I know him (<font color='blue'><b>Brown</b></font>),''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>says East, coming up.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Well, he (<font color='blue'><b>Brown</b></font>) is a plucky youngster, and will make a player,''  (<font color='red'><b>Brooke</b></font>)</div>says Brooke.

<p/>And five o’clock strikes. <div class="bookquote">``No side''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>is called, and the first day of the
School-house match is over.



<p/>CHAPTER VI--AFTER THE MATCH.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Some food we had.'' (<font color='red'><b>Shakespeare/SHAKESPEARE</b></font>)</div>--Shakespeare.
-LSB-Greek text-RSB---Theocr. Id.

<p/>As the boys scattered away from the ground, and East, leaning on Tom's
arm, and limping along, was beginning to consider what luxury they
should go and buy for tea to celebrate that glorious victory, the two
Brookes came striding by. Old Brooke caught sight of East, and stopped;
put his (<font color='blue'><b>Brookes</b></font>) hand kindly on his (<font color='blue'><b>Brookes</b></font>) shoulder, and said, <div class="bookquote">``Bravo, youngster; you
played famously. Not much the matter, I hope?''

 (<font color='red'><b>Brooke</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``No, nothing at all,''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>said East--<div class="bookquote">``only a little twist from that
charge.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Well, mind and get all right for next Saturday.''  (<font color='red'><b>the leader</b></font>)</div>And the leader passed
on, leaving East better for those few words than all the opodeldoc in
England would have made him (<font color='blue'><b>leader</b></font>), and Tom ready to give one of his (<font color='blue'><b>Tom</b></font>) ears for
as much notice. Ah! light words of those whom we love and honour, what
a power ye are, and how carelessly wielded by those who can use you!
Surely for these things also God will ask an account.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Tea's directly after locking-up, you see,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>said East, hobbling along as
fast as he (<font color='blue'><b>God</b></font>) could, <div class="bookquote">``so you come along down to Sally Harrowell's; that's
our School-house tuck-shop. She (<font color='blue'><b>Harrowell</b></font>) bakes such stunning murphies, we'll have
a penn'orth each for tea. Come along, or they'll all be gone.''

 (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div><p/>Tom's new purse and money burnt in his (<font color='blue'><b>Tom</b></font>) pocket; he (<font color='blue'><b>Tom</b></font>) wondered, as they
toddled through the quadrangle and along the street, whether East
would be insulted if he (<font color='blue'><b>Tom</b></font>) suggested further extravagance, as he (<font color='blue'><b>Tom</b></font>) had not
sufficient faith in a pennyworth of potatoes. At last he (<font color='blue'><b>Tom</b></font>) blurted out,--

<p/><div class="bookquote">``I say, East, can't we get something else besides potatoes? I've got
lots of money, you know.''

 (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Bless us, yes; I forgot,''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>said East, <div class="bookquote">``you've only just come. You see
all my tin's been gone this twelve weeks--it hardly ever lasts beyond
the first fortnight; and our allowances were all stopped this morning
for broken windows, so I haven't got a penny. I've got a tick at
Sally's, of course; but then I hate running it high, you see, towards
the end of the half, `cause one has to shell out for it all directly one
comes back, and that's a bore.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Tom/Brown/Tom Brown</b></font>)</div><p/>Tom didn't understand much of this talk, but seized on the fact that
East had no money, and was denying himself some little pet luxury in
consequence. <div class="bookquote">``Well, what shall I buy?''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>said he (<font color='blue'><b>Tom</b></font>), <div class="bookquote">``I'm uncommon hungry.''

 (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I say,''  (<font color='red'><b>him</b></font>)</div>said East, stopping to look at him (<font color='blue'><b>Tom</b></font>) and rest his (<font color='blue'><b>Tom</b></font>) leg, <div class="bookquote">``you're a
trump, Brown. I'll do the same by you next half. Let's have a pound of
sausages then. That's the best grub for tea I know of.''

 (<font color='red'><b>him</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Very well,''  (<font color='red'><b>Tom/Brown/Tom Brown</b></font>)</div>said Tom, as pleased as possible; <div class="bookquote">``where do they sell
them?''

 (<font color='red'><b>Tom/Brown/Tom Brown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Oh, over here, just opposite.''  (<font color='red'><b>Mrs. Porter</b></font>)</div>And they crossed the street and walked
into the cleanest little front room of a small house, half parlour,
half shop, and bought a pound of most particular sausages, East talking
pleasantly to Mrs. Porter while she (<font color='blue'><b>Porter</b></font>) put them in paper, and Tom doing the
paying part.

<p/>From Porter's they adjourned to Sally Harrowell's, where they found a
lot of School-house boys waiting for the roast potatoes, and relating
their own exploits in the day's match at the top of their voices. The
street opened at once into Sally's kitchen, a low brick-floored room,
with large recess for fire, and chimney-corner seats. Poor little Sally,
the most good-natured and much-enduring of womankind, was bustling
about, with a napkin in her (<font color='blue'><b>Sally</b></font>) hand, from her (<font color='blue'><b>Sally</b></font>) own oven to those of the
neighbours' cottages up the yard at the back of the house. Stumps, her (<font color='blue'><b>Sally</b></font>)
husband, a short, easy-going shoemaker, with a beery, humorous eye and
ponderous calves, who lived mostly on his (<font color='blue'><b>shoemaker</b></font>) wife's earnings, stood in
a corner of the room, exchanging shots of the roughest description of
repartee with every boy in turn. <div class="bookquote">``Stumps, you lout, you've had too
much beer again to-day.''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>```Twasn't of your paying for, then.'' ``Stumps's
calves are running down into his (<font color='blue'><b>Brown</b></font>) ankles; they want to get to grass.''
``Better be doing that than gone altogether like yours,'' etc.. Very poor
stuff it was, but it served to make time pass; and every now and then
Sally arrived in the middle with a smoking tin of potatoes, which was
cleared off in a few seconds, each boy as he (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>) seized his (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>) lot running
off to the house with ``Put me down two-penn'orth, Sally;'' <div class="bookquote">``Put down
three-penn'orth between me and Davis,''  (<font color='red'><b>Sally/Harrowell/Sally Harrowell</b></font>)</div>etc.. How she (<font color='blue'><b>Sally</b></font>) ever kept the
accounts so straight as she (<font color='blue'><b>Sally</b></font>) did, in her (<font color='blue'><b>Sally</b></font>) head and on her (<font color='blue'><b>Sally</b></font>) slate, was a
perfect wonder.

<p/>East and Tom got served at last, and started back for the School-house,
just as the locking-up bell began to ring, East on the way recounting
the life and adventures of Stumps, who was a character. Amongst his (<font color='blue'><b>character</b></font>)
other small avocations, he (<font color='blue'><b>character</b></font>) was the hind carrier of a sedan-chair, the
last of its race, in which the Rugby ladies still went out to tea, and
in which, when he (<font color='blue'><b>character</b></font>) was fairly harnessed and carrying a load, it was the
delight of small and mischievous boys to follow him (<font color='blue'><b>character</b></font>) and whip his (<font color='blue'><b>character</b></font>) calves.
This was too much for the temper even of Stumps, and he (<font color='blue'><b>character</b></font>) would pursue his (<font color='blue'><b>character</b></font>)
tormentors in a vindictive and apoplectic manner when released, but was
easily pacified by twopence to buy beer with.

<p/>The lower-school boys of the School-house, some fifteen in number, had
tea in the lower-fifth school, and were presided over by the old verger
or head-porter. Each boy had a quarter of a loaf of bread and pat of
butter, and as much tea as he (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>) pleased; and there was scarcely one
who didn't add to this some further luxury, such as baked potatoes, a
herring, sprats, or something of the sort. But few at this period of the
half-year could live up to a pound of Porter's sausages, and East was
in great magnificence upon the strength of theirs. He (<font color='blue'><b>Porter</b></font>) had produced a
toasting-fork from his (<font color='blue'><b>Porter</b></font>) study, and set Tom to toast the sausages,
while he (<font color='blue'><b>Porter</b></font>) mounted guard over their butter and potatoes. ```Cause,'' as he (<font color='blue'><b>Porter</b></font>)
explained, <div class="bookquote">``you're a new boy, and they'll play you some trick and get
our butter; but you can toast just as well as I.''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>So Tom, in the midst
of three or four more urchins similarly employed, toasted his (<font color='blue'><b>Tom</b></font>) face and
the sausages at the same time before the huge fire, till the latter
cracked; when East from his (<font color='blue'><b>Tom</b></font>) watch-tower shouted that they were done, and
then the feast proceeded, and the festive cups of tea were filled
and emptied, and Tom imparted of the sausages in small bits to many
neighbours, and thought he (<font color='blue'><b>Tom</b></font>) had never tasted such good potatoes or seen
such jolly boys. They on their parts waived all ceremony, and pegged
away at the sausages and potatoes, and remembering Tom's performance in
goal, voted East's new crony a brick. After tea, and while the things
were being cleared away, they gathered round the fire, and the talk on
the match still went on; and those who had them to show pulled up their
trousers and showed the hacks they had received in the good cause.

<p/>They were soon, however, all turned out of the school; and East
conducted Tom up to his (<font color='blue'><b>Tom</b></font>) bedroom, that he (<font color='blue'><b>Tom</b></font>) might get on clean things, and
wash himself before singing.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``What's singing?''  (<font color='red'><b>Tom/Brown/Tom Brown</b></font>)</div>said Tom, taking his (<font color='blue'><b>Tom</b></font>) head out of his (<font color='blue'><b>Tom</b></font>) basin, where he (<font color='blue'><b>Tom</b></font>)
had been plunging it in cold water.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Well, you are jolly green,''  (<font color='red'><b>friend</b></font>)</div>answered his (<font color='blue'><b>Tom</b></font>) friend, from a neighbouring
basin. <div class="bookquote">``Why, the last six Saturdays of every half we sing of course; and
this is the first of them. No first lesson to do, you know, and lie in
bed to-morrow morning.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``But who sings?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Why, everybody, of course; you'll see soon enough. We begin directly
after supper, and sing till bed-time. It ain't such good fun now,
though, as in the summer half; `cause then we sing in the little fives
court, under the library, you know. We take out tables, and the big boys
sit round and drink beer--double allowance on Saturday nights; and we
cut about the quadrangle between the songs, and it looks like a lot of
robbers in a cave. And the louts come and pound at the great gates, and
we pound back again, and shout at them. But this half we only sing in
the hall. Come along down to my study.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/>Their principal employment in the study was to clear out East's table;
removing the drawers and ornaments and tablecloth; for he (<font color='blue'><b>Tom</b></font>) lived in the
bottom passage, and his (<font color='blue'><b>Tom</b></font>) table was in requisition for the singing.

<p/>Supper came in due course at seven o’clock, consisting of bread and
cheese and beer, which was all saved for the singing; and directly
afterwards the fags went to work to prepare the hall. The School-house
hall, as has been said, is a great long high room, with two large fires
on one side, and two large iron-bound tables, one running down the
middle, and the other along the wall opposite the fireplaces. Around the
upper fire the fags placed the tables in the form of a horse-shoe, and
upon them the jugs with the Saturday night's allowance of beer. Then
the big boys used to drop in and take their seats, bringing with them
bottled beer and song books; for although they all knew the songs by
heart, it was the thing to have an old manuscript book descended from
some departed hero, in which they were all carefully written out.

<p/>The sixth-form boys had not yet appeared; so, to fill up the gap, an
interesting and time-honoured ceremony was gone through. Each new boy
was placed on the table in turn, and made to sing a solo, under the
penalty of drinking a large mug of salt and water if he (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>) resisted or
broke down. However, the new boys all sing like nightingales to-night,
and the salt water is not in requisition--Tom, as his (<font color='blue'><b>Tom</b></font>) part, performing
the old west-country song of <div class="bookquote">``The Leather Bottel''  (<font color='red'><b>Tom/Brown/Tom Brown</b></font>)</div>with considerable
applause. And at the half-hour down come the sixth and fifth form boys,
and take their places at the tables, which are filled up by the next
biggest boys, the rest, for whom there is no room at the table, standing
round outside.

<p/>The glasses and mugs are filled, and then the fugleman strikes up the
old sea-song,

<p/><div class="bookquote">``A wet sheet and a flowing sea,
And a wind that follows fast,''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>etc.,

<p/>which is the invariable first song in the School-house; and all the
seventy voices join in, not mindful of harmony, but bent on noise, which
they attain decidedly, but the general effect isn't bad. And then follow
<div class="bookquote">``The British Grenadiers,''  (<font color='red'><b>Brooke</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``Billy Taylor,''  (<font color='red'><b>Brooke</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``The Siege of Seringapatam,''
 (<font color='red'><b>Brooke</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``Three Jolly Postboys,''  (<font color='red'><b>Brooke</b></font>)</div>and other vociferous songs in rapid succession,
including <div class="bookquote">``The Chesapeake and Shannon,''  (<font color='red'><b>Brooke</b></font>)</div>a song lately introduced in
honour of old Brooke; and when they come to the words,

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Brave Broke he (<font color='blue'><b>Shannon</b></font>) waved his (<font color='blue'><b>Shannon</b></font>) sword, crying, Now, my lads, aboard,
And we'll stop their playing Yankee-doodle-dandy oh!''

 (<font color='red'><b>Brooke</b></font>)</div><p/>you expect the roof to come down. The sixth and fifth know that <div class="bookquote">``brave
Broke''  (<font color='red'><b>Shannon</b></font>)</div>of the Shannon was no sort of relation to our old Brooke. The
fourth form are uncertain in their belief, but for the most part hold
that old Brooke was a midshipman then on board his (<font color='blue'><b>midshipman</b></font>) uncle's ship. And the
lower school never doubt for a moment that it was our old Brooke who led
the boarders, in what capacity they care not a straw. During the pauses
the bottled-beer corks fly rapidly, and the talk is fast and merry, and
the big boys--at least all of them who have a fellow-feeling for dry
throats--hand their mugs over their shoulders to be emptied by the small
ones who stand round behind.

<p/>Then Warner, the head of the house, gets up and wants to speak; but he (<font color='blue'><b>Warner</b></font>)
can't, for every boy knows what's coming. And the big boys who sit at
the tables pound them and cheer; and the small boys who stand behind
pound one another, and cheer, and rush about the hall cheering. Then
silence being made, Warner reminds them of the old School-house custom
of drinking the healths, on the first night of singing, of those who are
going to leave at the end of the half. <div class="bookquote">``He (<font color='blue'><b>Shannon</b></font>) sees that they know what he (<font color='blue'><b>Shannon</b></font>)
is going to say already''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>-LRB-loud cheers-RRB-, <div class="bookquote">``and so won't keep them, but
only ask them to treat the toast as it deserves. It is the head of the
eleven, the head of big-side football, their leader on this glorious
day--Pater Brooke!''

 (<font color='red'><b>Brooke</b></font>)</div><p/>And away goes the pounding and cheering again, becoming deafening when
old Brooke gets on his (<font color='blue'><b>Warner</b></font>) legs; till, a table having broken down, and a
gallon or so of beer been upset, and all throats getting dry, silence
ensues, and the hero speaks, leaning his (<font color='blue'><b>hero</b></font>) hands on the table, and bending
a little forwards. No action, no tricks of oratory--plain, strong, and
straight, like his (<font color='blue'><b>hero</b></font>) play.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Gentlemen of the School-house! I am very proud of the way in which
you have received my name, and I wish I could say all I should like in
return. But I know I shan't. However, I'll do the best I can to say what
seems to me ought to be said by a fellow who's just going to leave,
and who has spent a good slice of his (<font color='blue'><b>fellow</b></font>) life here. Eight years it is, and
eight such years as I can never hope to have again. So now I hope you'll
all listen to me''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>-LRB-loud cheers of <div class="bookquote">``That we will'' (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>-RRB-, <div class="bookquote">``for I'm going to
talk seriously. You're bound to listen to me for what's the use of
calling me `pater,' and all that, if you don't mind what I say? And
I'm going to talk seriously, because I feel so. It's a jolly time,

<div class="bookquote">``But half a dozen fellows can't keep it up for two hours against two

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Now, I'm as proud of the house as any one. I believe it's the best
house in the school, out and out.''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>-LRB-Cheers.-RRB- <div class="bookquote">``But it's a long way from
what I want to see it. First, there's a deal of bullying going on. I
know it well. I don't pry about and interfere; that only makes it
more underhand, and encourages the small boys to come to us with their
fingers in their eyes telling tales, and so we should be worse off than
ever. It's very little kindness for the sixth to meddle generally--you
youngsters mind that. You'll be all the better football players for
learning to stand it, and to take your own parts, and fight it through.
But depend on it, there's nothing breaks up a house like bullying.
Bullies are cowards, and one coward makes many; so good-bye to the
School-house match if bullying gets ahead here.''  (<font color='red'><b>the boys</b></font>)</div>-LRB-Loud applause from
the small boys, who look meaningly at Flashman and other boys at the
tables.-RRB- ``Then there's fuddling about in the public-house, and drinking
bad spirits, and punch, and such rot-gut stuff. That won't make good
drop-kicks or chargers of you, take my word for it. You get plenty of
good beer here, and that's enough for you; and drinking isn't fine or
manly, whatever some of you may think of it.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``One other thing I must have a word about. A lot of you think and say,
for I've heard you, `There's this new Doctor hasn't been here so long
as some of us, and he (<font color='blue'><b>Doctor</b></font>)'s changing all the old customs. Rugby, and the
Schoolhouse especially, are going to the dogs. Stand up for the good old
ways, and down with the Doctor!' Now I'm as fond of old Rugby customs
and ways as any of you, and I've been here longer than any of you, and
I'll give you a word of advice in time, for I shouldn't like to see any
of you getting sacked. `Down with the Doctor's' easier said than done.
You'll find him (<font color='blue'><b>Doctor</b></font>) pretty tight on his (<font color='blue'><b>Doctor</b></font>) perch, I take it, and an awkwardish
customer to handle in that line. Besides now, what customs has he (<font color='blue'><b>Doctor</b></font>) put
down? There was the good old custom of taking the linchpins out of the
farmers' and bagmen's gigs at the fairs, and a cowardly, blackguard
custom it was. We all know what came of it, and no wonder the Doctor

down.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``The hounds,''  (<font color='red'><b>a boy leader</b></font>)</div>calls out a fifth-form boy, clad in a green cutaway with
brass buttons and cord trousers, the leader of the sporting interest,
and reputed a great rider and keen hand generally.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Well, we had six or seven mangy harriers and beagles belonging to the
house, I'll allow, and had had them for years, and that the Doctor
put them down. But what good ever came of them? Only rows with all the

ten times over. What else?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/>No answer.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Well, I won't go on. Think it over for yourselves. You'll find, I
believe, that he (<font color='blue'><b>Doctor</b></font>) don't meddle with any one that's worth keeping. And
mind now, I say again, look out for squalls if you will go your own way,
and that way ain't the Doctor's, for it'll lead to grief. You all know
that I'm not the fellow to back a master through thick and thin. If I
saw him (<font color='blue'><b>master</b></font>) stopping football, or cricket, or bathing, or sparring, I'd be
as ready as any fellow to stand up about it. But he (<font color='blue'><b>fellow</b></font>) don't; he (<font color='blue'><b>fellow</b></font>) encourages

done. But it's a solemn thing to be thinking of leaving a place which
one has lived in and loved for eight years; and if one can say a word
for the good of the old house at such a time, why, it should be said,
whether bitter or sweet. If I hadn't been proud of the house and
you--ay, no one knows how proud--I shouldn't be blowing you up. And now
let's get to singing. But before I sit down I must give you a toast to
be drunk with three-times-three and all the honours. It's a toast which
I hope every one of us, wherever he (<font color='blue'><b>It</b></font>) may go hereafter, will never fail
to drink when he (<font color='blue'><b>It</b></font>) thinks of the brave, bright days of his (<font color='blue'><b>It</b></font>) boyhood. It's a
toast which should bind us all together, and to those who've gone before
and who'll come after us here. It is the dear old School-house--the best
house of the best school in England!''

 (<font color='red'><b>boys</b></font>)</div><p/>My dear boys, old and young, you who have belonged, or do belong, to
other schools and other houses, don't begin throwing my poor little book
about the room, and abusing me and it, and vowing you'll read no more
when you get to this point. I allow you've provocation for it. But come
now--would you, any of you, give a fig for a fellow who didn't believe
in and stand up for his (<font color='blue'><b>fellow</b></font>) own house and his (<font color='blue'><b>fellow</b></font>) own school? You know you
wouldn't. Then don't object to me cracking up the old School house,
Rugby. Haven't I a right to do it, when I'm taking all the trouble
of writing this true history for all of your benefits? If you ain't
satisfied, go and write the history of your own houses in your own
times, and say all you know for your own schools and houses, provided
it's true, and I'll read it without abusing you.

<p/>The last few words hit the audience in their weakest place. They had
been not altogether enthusiastic at several parts of old Brooke's
speech; but <div class="bookquote">``the best house of the best school in England''  (<font color='red'><b>Brooke</b></font>)</div>was too much
for them all, and carried even the sporting and drinking interests off
their legs into rapturous applause, and -LRB-it is to be hoped-RRB- resolutions
to lead a new life and remember old Brooke's words--which, however, they
didn't altogether do, as will appear hereafter.

<p/>But it required all old Brooke's popularity to carry down parts of his (<font color='blue'><b>their</b></font>)
speech--especially that relating to the Doctor. For there are no such
bigoted holders by established forms and customs, be they never so
foolish or meaningless, as English school-boys--at least, as the
school-boys of our generation. We magnified into heroes every boy who
had left, and looked upon him (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>) with awe and reverence when he (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>) revisited
the place a year or so afterwards, on his (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>) way to or from Oxford or
Cambridge; and happy was the boy who remembered him (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>), and sure of an
audience as he (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>) expounded what he (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>) used to do and say, though it were sad
enough stuff to make angels, not to say head-masters, weep.

<p/>We looked upon every trumpery little custom and habit which had obtained
in the School as though it had been a law of the Medes and Persians, and
regarded the infringement or variation of it as a sort of sacrilege. And
the Doctor, than whom no man or boy had a stronger liking for old school
customs which were good and sensible, had, as has already been hinted,
come into most decided collision with several which were neither the one
nor the other. And as old Brooke had said, when he (<font color='blue'><b>Doctor</b></font>) came into collision
with boys or customs, there was nothing for them but to give in or take
themselves off; because what he (<font color='blue'><b>Doctor</b></font>) said had to be done, and no mistake
about it. And this was beginning to be pretty clearly understood. The
boys felt that there was a strong man over them, who would have things
his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) own way, and hadn't yet learnt that he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) was a wise and loving man
also. His (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) personal character and influence had not had time to make
itself felt, except by a very few of the bigger boys with whom he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) came
more directly into contact; and he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) was looked upon with great fear and
dislike by the great majority even of his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) own house. For he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) had found
School and School-house in a state of monstrous license and misrule,
and was still employed in the necessary but unpopular work of setting up
order with a strong hand.

<p/>However, as has been said, old Brooke triumphed, and the boys cheered
him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) and then the Doctor. And then more songs came, and the healths of
the other boys about to leave, who each made a speech, one flowery,
another maudlin, a third prosy, and so on, which are not necessary to be
here recorded.

<p/>Half-past nine struck in the middle of the performance of <div class="bookquote">``Auld Lang
Syne,''  (<font color='red'><b>the youths</b></font>)</div>a most obstreperous proceeding, during which there was an immense
amount of standing with one foot on the table, knocking mugs together
and shaking hands, without which accompaniments it seems impossible
for the youths of Britain to take part in that famous old song. The
under-porter of the School-house entered during the performance, bearing
five or six long wooden candlesticks with lighted dips in them, which he (<font color='blue'><b>it</b></font>)
proceeded to stick into their holes in such part of the great tables
as he (<font color='blue'><b>it</b></font>) could get at; and then stood outside the ring till the end of the
song, when he (<font color='blue'><b>it</b></font>) was hailed with shouts.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Bill you old muff, the half-hour hasn't struck.''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``Here, Bill, drink
some cocktail.''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``Sing us a song, old boy.''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``Don't you wish you may
get the table?''  (<font color='red'><b>Bill</b></font>)</div>Bill drank the proffered cocktail not unwillingly, and
putting down the empty glass, remonstrated. <div class="bookquote">``Now gentlemen, there's only
ten minutes to prayers, and we must get the hall straight.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/>Shouts of <div class="bookquote">``No, no!''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>and a violent effort to strike up <div class="bookquote">``Billy Taylor''  (<font color='red'><b>Bill</b></font>)</div>for
the third time. Bill looked appealingly to old Brooke, who got up and
stopped the noise. <div class="bookquote">``Now then, lend a hand, you youngsters, and get the
tables back; clear away the jugs and glasses. Bill's right. Open
the windows, Warner.''  (<font color='red'><b>The boy</b></font>)</div>The boy addressed, who sat by the long ropes,
proceeded to pull up the great windows, and let in a clear, fresh rush
of night air, which made the candles flicker and gutter, and the fires
roar. The circle broke up, each collaring his (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>) own jug, glass, and
song-book; Bill pounced on the big table, and began to rattle it away to
its place outside the buttery door. The lower-passage boys carried off
their small tables, aided by their friends; while above all, standing
on the great hall-table, a knot of untiring sons of harmony made night
doleful by a prolonged performance of <div class="bookquote">``God Save the King.''  (<font color='red'><b>sons</b></font>)</div>His (<font color='blue'><b>Bill</b></font>) Majesty
King William the Fourth then reigned over us, a monarch deservedly
popular amongst the boys addicted to melody, to whom he (<font color='blue'><b>monarch</b></font>) was chiefly
known from the beginning of that excellent if slightly vulgar song in
which they much delighted,--

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Come, neighbours all, both great and small,
Perform your duties here,
And loudly sing, `Live Billy, our king,'
For bating the tax upon beer.''

 (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div><p/>Others of the more learned in songs also celebrated his (<font color='blue'><b>monarch</b></font>) praises in
a sort of ballad, which I take to have been written by some Irish
loyalist. I have forgotten all but the chorus, which ran,--

<p/><div class="bookquote">``God save our good King William,
Be his (<font color='blue'><b>William</b></font>) name for ever blest;
He (<font color='blue'><b>William</b></font>)'s the father of all his (<font color='blue'><b>William</b></font>) people,
And the guardian of all the rest.''

 (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div><p/>In troth we were loyal subjects in those days, in a rough way. I trust
that our successors make as much of her (<font color='blue'><b>Others</b></font>) present Majesty, and, having
regard to the greater refinement of the times, have adopted or written
other songs equally hearty, but more civilized, in her (<font color='blue'><b>Others</b></font>) honour.

<p/>Then the quarter to ten struck, and the prayer-bell rang. The sixth and
fifth form boys ranged themselves in their school order along the wall,
on either side of the great fires, the middle-fifth and upper-school
boys round the long table in the middle of the hall, and the
lower-school boys round the upper part of the second long table, which
ran down the side of the hall farthest from the fires. Here Tom found
himself at the bottom of all, in a state of mind and body not at all fit
for prayers, as he (<font color='blue'><b>Tom</b></font>) thought; and so tried hard to make himself serious,
but couldn't, for the life of him (<font color='blue'><b>Tom</b></font>), do anything but repeat in his (<font color='blue'><b>Tom</b></font>) head
the choruses of some of the songs, and stare at all the boys opposite,
wondering at the brilliancy of their waistcoats, and speculating what
sort of fellows they were. The steps of the head-porter are heard on the
stairs, and a light gleams at the door. <div class="bookquote">``Hush!''  (<font color='red'><b>the boys</b></font>)</div>from the fifth-form boys
who stand there, and then in strides the Doctor, cap on head, book
in one hand, and gathering up his (<font color='blue'><b>Doctor</b></font>) gown in the other. He (<font color='blue'><b>Doctor</b></font>) walks up the
middle, and takes his (<font color='blue'><b>Doctor</b></font>) post by Warner, who begins calling over the names.
The Doctor takes no notice of anything, but quietly turns over his (<font color='blue'><b>Doctor</b></font>) book
and finds the place, and then stands, cap in hand and finger in book,
looking straight before his (<font color='blue'><b>Doctor</b></font>) nose. He (<font color='blue'><b>Doctor</b></font>) knows better than any one when to
look, and when to see nothing. To-night is singing night, and there's
been lots of noise and no harm done--nothing but beer drunk, and nobody
the worse for it, though some of them do look hot and excited. So the
Doctor sees nothing, but fascinates Tom in a horrible manner as he (<font color='blue'><b>Tom</b></font>)
stands there, and reads out the psalm, in that deep, ringing, searching
voice of his (<font color='blue'><b>Tom</b></font>). Prayers are over, and Tom still stares open-mouthed after
the Doctor's retiring figure, when he (<font color='blue'><b>Tom</b></font>) feels a pull at his (<font color='blue'><b>Tom</b></font>) sleeve, and
turning round, sees East.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``I say, were you ever tossed in a blanket?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``No,''  (<font color='red'><b>Tom/Brown/Tom Brown</b></font>)</div>said Tom; <div class="bookquote">``why?''

 (<font color='red'><b>Tom/Brown/Tom Brown</b></font>)</div><p/>```Cause there'll be tossing to-night, most likely, before the sixth come
up to bed. So if you funk, you just come along and hide, or else they'll
catch you and toss you.''

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Were you ever tossed? Does it hurt?''  (<font color='red'><b>Tom/Brown/Tom Brown</b></font>)</div>inquired Tom.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Oh yes, bless you, a dozen times,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>said East, as he (<font color='blue'><b>Tom</b></font>) hobbled along by
Tom's side upstairs. <div class="bookquote">``It don't hurt unless you fall on the floor. But
most fellows don't like it.''

 (<font color='red'><b>boys</b></font>)</div><p/>They stopped at the fireplace in the top passage, where were a crowd of
small boys whispering together, and evidently unwilling to go up
into the bedrooms. In a minute, however, a study door opened, and a
sixth-form boy came out, and off they all scuttled up the stairs, and
then noiselessly dispersed to their different rooms. Tom's heart beat
rather quick as he (<font color='blue'><b>Tom</b></font>) and East reached their room, but he (<font color='blue'><b>Tom</b></font>) had made up his (<font color='blue'><b>Tom</b></font>)
mind. <div class="bookquote">``I shan't hide, East,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>said he (<font color='blue'><b>Tom</b></font>).

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Very well, old fellow,''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>replied East, evidently pleased; <div class="bookquote">``no more shall
I. They'll be here for us directly.''

 (<font color='red'><b>dozen</b></font>)</div><p/>The room was a great big one, with a dozen beds in it, but not a boy
that Tom could see except East and himself. East pulled off his (<font color='blue'><b>Tom</b></font>) coat and
waistcoat, and then sat on the bottom of his (<font color='blue'><b>Tom</b></font>) bed whistling and pulling
off his (<font color='blue'><b>Tom</b></font>) boots. Tom followed his (<font color='blue'><b>Tom</b></font>) example.

<p/>A noise and steps are heard in the passage, the door opens, and in rush
four or five great fifth-form boys, headed by Flashman in his (<font color='blue'><b>Tom</b></font>) glory.

<p/>Tom and East slept in the farther corner of the room, and were not seen
at first.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Gone to ground, eh?''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>roared Flashman. <div class="bookquote">``Push `em out then, boys; look
under the beds.''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>And he (<font color='blue'><b>Tom</b></font>) pulled up the little white curtain of the one
nearest him (<font color='blue'><b>Tom</b></font>). <div class="bookquote">``Who-o-op!''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Tom</b></font>) roared, pulling away at the leg of a small
boy, who held on tight to the leg of the bed, and sang out lustily for
mercy.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Here, lend a hand, one of you, and help me pull out this young howling
brute.--Hold your tongue, sir, or I'll kill you.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Oh, please, Flashman, please, Walker, don't toss me! I'll fag for
you--I'll do anything--only don't toss me.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``You be hanged,''  (<font color='red'><b>Flashman</b></font>)</div>said Flashman, lugging the wretched boy along; ```twon't
hurt you,--you!--Come along, boys; here he (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>) is.''

<p/><div class="bookquote">``I say, Flashey,''  (<font color='red'><b>the boys</b></font>)</div>sang out another of the big boys; <div class="bookquote">``drop that; you
heard what old Pater Brooke said to-night. I'll be hanged if we'll toss
any one against their will. No more bullying. Let him (<font color='blue'><b>Walker</b></font>) go, I say.''

 (<font color='red'><b>the boys</b></font>)</div><p/>Flashman, with an oath and a kick, released his (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>) prey, who rushed
headlong under his (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>) bed again, for fear they should change their minds,
and crept along underneath the other beds, till he (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>) got under that of the
sixth-form boy, which he (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>) knew they daren't disturb.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``There's plenty of youngsters don't care about it,''  (<font color='red'><b>Walker</b></font>)</div>said Walker. <div class="bookquote">``Here,
here's Scud East--you'll be tossed, won't you, young un?''  (<font color='red'><b>Black</b></font>)</div>Scud was
East's nickname, or Black, as we called it, gained by his (<font color='blue'><b>Black</b></font>) fleetness of
foot.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Yes,''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>said East, <div class="bookquote">``if you like, only mind my foot.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``And here's another who didn't hide.--Hullo! new boy; what's your name,
sir?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Brown.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Well, Whitey Brown, you don't mind being tossed?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``No,''  (<font color='red'><b>Tom/Brown/Tom Brown</b></font>)</div>said Tom, setting his (<font color='blue'><b>Tom</b></font>) teeth.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Come along then, boys,''  (<font color='red'><b>Walker</b></font>)</div>sang out Walker; and away they all went,
carrying along Tom and East, to the intense relief of four or five other
small boys, who crept out from under the beds and behind them.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``What a trump Scud is!''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>said one. <div class="bookquote">``They won't come back here now.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``And that new boy, too; he (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>) must be a good-plucked one.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Ah! wait till he (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>) has been tossed on to the floor; see how he (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>)'ll like it
then!''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/>Meantime the procession went down the passage to Number 7, the largest
room, and the scene of the tossing, in the middle of which was a great
open space. Here they joined other parties of the bigger boys, each
with a captive or two, some willing to be tossed, some sullen, and some
frightened to death. At Walker's suggestion all who were afraid were let
off, in honour of Pater Brooke's speech.

<p/>Then a dozen big boys seized hold of a blanket, dragged from one of the
beds. <div class="bookquote">``In with Scud; quick! there's no time to lose.''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>East was chucked
into the blanket. <div class="bookquote">``Once, twice, thrice, and away!''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>Up he (<font color='blue'><b>Walker</b></font>) went like a
shuttlecock, but not quite up to the ceiling.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Now, boys, with a will,''  (<font color='red'><b>Walker</b></font>)</div>cried Walker; <div class="bookquote">``once, twice, thrice, and away!''
 (<font color='red'><b>Walker</b></font>)</div>This time he (<font color='blue'><b>Walker</b></font>) went clean up, and kept himself from touching the ceiling
with his (<font color='blue'><b>Walker</b></font>) hand, and so again a third time, when he (<font color='blue'><b>Walker</b></font>) was turned out, and
up went another boy. And then came Tom's turn. He (<font color='blue'><b>Tom</b></font>) lay quite still, by
East's advice, and didn't dislike the <div class="bookquote">``once, twice, thrice;''  (<font color='red'><b>He</b></font>)</div>but the
<div class="bookquote">``away''  (<font color='red'><b>He</b></font>)</div>wasn't so pleasant. They were in good wind now, and sent him (<font color='blue'><b>Tom</b></font>)
slap up to the ceiling first time, against which his (<font color='blue'><b>Tom</b></font>) knees came rather
sharply. But the moment's pause before descending was the rub--the
feeling of utter helplessness and of leaving his (<font color='blue'><b>Tom</b></font>) whole inside behind him (<font color='blue'><b>Tom</b></font>)
sticking to the ceiling. Tom was very near shouting to be set down when
he (<font color='blue'><b>Tom</b></font>) found himself back in the blanket, but thought of East, and didn't;
and so took his (<font color='blue'><b>Tom</b></font>) three tosses without a kick or a cry, and was called a
young trump for his (<font color='blue'><b>Tom</b></font>) pains.

<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Tom</b></font>) and East, having earned it, stood now looking on. No catastrophe
happened, as all the captives were cool hands, and didn't struggle. This
didn't suit Flashman. What your real bully likes in tossing is when the
boys kick and struggle, or hold on to one side of the blanket, and so
get pitched bodily on to the floor; it's no fun to him (<font color='blue'><b>bully</b></font>) when no one is
hurt or frightened.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Let's toss two of them together, Walker,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>suggested he (<font color='blue'><b>bully</b></font>).

<p/><div class="bookquote">``What a cursed bully you are, Flashey!''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>rejoined the other. <div class="bookquote">``Up with
another one.''

 (<font color='red'><b>boys</b></font>)</div><p/>And so now two boys were tossed together, the peculiar hardship of which
is, that it's too much for human nature to lie still then and share
troubles; and so the wretched pair of small boys struggle in the air
which shall fall a-top in the descent, to the no small risk of both
falling out of the blanket, and the huge delight of brutes like
Flashman.

<p/>But now there's a cry that the praepostor of the room is coming; so the
tossing stops, and all scatter to their different rooms; and Tom is
left to turn in, with the first day's experience of a public school to
meditate upon.



<p/>CHAPTER VII--SETTLING TO THE COLLAR.

<p/>``Says Giles, `'Tis mortal hard to go,
But if so be's I must
I means to follow arter he (<font color='blue'><b>Giles</b></font>)
As goes hisself the fust.'''--Ballad.

<p/>Everybody, I suppose, knows the dreamy, delicious state in which one
lies, half asleep, half awake, while consciousness begins to return
after a sound night's rest in a new place which we are glad to be in,
following upon a day of unwonted excitement and exertion. There are
few pleasanter pieces of life. The worst of it is that they last such
a short time; for nurse them as you will, by lying perfectly passive
in mind and body, you can't make more than five minutes or so of them.
After which time the stupid, obtrusive, wakeful entity which we call
<div class="bookquote">``I'' (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>, as impatient as he (<font color='blue'><b>Tom</b></font>) is stiff-necked, spite of our teeth will force
himself back again, and take possession of us down to our very toes.

<p/>It was in this state that Master Tom lay at half-past seven on the
morning following the day of his (<font color='blue'><b>Tom</b></font>) arrival, and from his (<font color='blue'><b>Tom</b></font>) clean little
white bed watched the movements of Bogle -LRB-the generic name by which the
successive shoeblacks of the School-house were known-RRB-, as he (<font color='blue'><b>Bogle</b></font>) marched
round from bed to bed, collecting the dirty shoes and boots, and
depositing clean ones in their places.

<p/>There he (<font color='blue'><b>Bogle</b></font>) lay, half doubtful as to where exactly in the universe he (<font color='blue'><b>Bogle</b></font>) was,
but conscious that he (<font color='blue'><b>Bogle</b></font>) had made a step in life which he (<font color='blue'><b>Bogle</b></font>) had been anxious
to make. It was only just light as he (<font color='blue'><b>Bogle</b></font>) looked lazily out of the wide
windows, and saw the tops of the great elms, and the rooks circling
about and cawing remonstrances to the lazy ones of their commonwealth
before starting in a body for the neighbouring ploughed fields. The
noise of the room-door closing behind Bogle, as he (<font color='blue'><b>Bogle</b></font>) made his (<font color='blue'><b>Bogle</b></font>) exit with
the shoebasket under his (<font color='blue'><b>Bogle</b></font>) arm, roused him (<font color='blue'><b>Bogle</b></font>) thoroughly, and he (<font color='blue'><b>Bogle</b></font>) sat up in
bed and looked round the room. What in the world could be the matter
with his (<font color='blue'><b>Bogle</b></font>) shoulders and loins? He (<font color='blue'><b>Bogle</b></font>) felt as if he (<font color='blue'><b>Bogle</b></font>) had been severely beaten
all down his (<font color='blue'><b>Bogle</b></font>) back--the natural results of his (<font color='blue'><b>Bogle</b></font>) performance at his (<font color='blue'><b>Bogle</b></font>) first
match. He (<font color='blue'><b>Bogle</b></font>) drew up his (<font color='blue'><b>Bogle</b></font>) knees and rested his (<font color='blue'><b>Bogle</b></font>) chin on them, and went over
all the events of yesterday, rejoicing in his (<font color='blue'><b>Bogle</b></font>) new life, what he (<font color='blue'><b>Bogle</b></font>) had seen
of it, and all that was to come.

<p/>Presently one or two of the other boys roused themselves, and began to
sit up and talk to one another in low tones. Then East, after a roll
or two, came to an anchor also, and nodding to Tom, began examining his (<font color='blue'><b>Tom</b></font>)
ankle.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``What a pull,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>said he (<font color='blue'><b>Tom</b></font>), <div class="bookquote">``that it's lie-in-bed, for I shall be as lame as
a tree, I think.''

 (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div><p/>It was Sunday morning, and Sunday lectures had not yet been established;
so that nothing but breakfast intervened between bed and eleven o’clock
chapel--a gap by no means easy to fill up: in fact, though received with
the correct amount of grumbling, the first lecture instituted by
the Doctor shortly afterwards was a great boon to the School. It was
lie-in-bed, and no one was in a hurry to get up, especially in rooms
where the sixth-form boy was a good-tempered fellow, as was the case in
Tom's room, and allowed the small boys to talk and laugh and do pretty
much what they pleased, so long as they didn't disturb him (<font color='blue'><b>Tom</b></font>). His (<font color='blue'><b>Tom</b></font>) bed was
a bigger one than the rest, standing in the corner by the fireplace,
with a washing-stand and large basin by the side, where he (<font color='blue'><b>Tom</b></font>) lay in state
with his (<font color='blue'><b>Tom</b></font>) white curtains tucked in so as to form a retiring place--an
awful subject of contemplation to Tom, who slept nearly opposite, and
watched the great man rouse himself and take a book from under his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>)
pillow, and begin reading, leaning his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) head on his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) hand, and turning his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>)
back to the room. Soon, however, a noise of striving urchins arose, and
muttered encouragements from the neighbouring boys of <div class="bookquote">``Go it, Tadpole!''
 (<font color='red'><b>the boys</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``Now, young Green!''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``Haul away his (<font color='blue'><b>Green</b></font>) blanket!''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``Slipper him (<font color='blue'><b>Green</b></font>) on the hands!''
 (<font color='red'><b>Young</b></font>)</div>Young Green and little Hall, commonly called Tadpole, from his (<font color='blue'><b>Green</b></font>) great
black head and thin legs, slept side by side far away by the door, and
were for ever playing one another tricks, which usually ended, as on
this morning, in open and violent collision; and now, unmindful of all
order and authority, there they were, each hauling away at the other's
bedclothes with one hand, and with the other, armed with a slipper,
belabouring whatever portion of the body of his (<font color='blue'><b>Green</b></font>) adversary came within
reach.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Hold that noise up in the corner,''  (<font color='red'><b>Green</b></font>)</div>called out the praepostor, sitting
up and looking round his (<font color='blue'><b>Green</b></font>) curtains; and the Tadpole and young Green sank
down into their disordered beds; and then, looking at his (<font color='blue'><b>Green</b></font>) watch, added,
<div class="bookquote">``Hullo! past eight. Whose turn for hot water?''

 (<font color='red'><b>Green</b></font>)</div><p/>-LRB-Where the praepostor was particular in his (<font color='blue'><b>Green</b></font>) ablutions, the fags in his (<font color='blue'><b>Green</b></font>)
room had to descend in turn to the kitchen, and beg or steal hot water
for him (<font color='blue'><b>Green</b></font>); and often the custom extended farther, and two boys went down
every morning to get a supply for the whole room.-RRB-

<p/><div class="bookquote">``East's and Tadpole's,''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>answered the senior fag, who kept the rota.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``I can't go,''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>said East; <div class="bookquote">``I'm dead lame.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Well, be quick some of you, that's all,''  (<font color='red'><b>the man</b></font>)</div>said the great man, as he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>)
turned out of bed, and putting on his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) slippers, went out into the great
passage, which runs the whole length of the bedrooms, to get his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) Sunday
habiliments out of his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) portmanteau.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Let me go for you,''  (<font color='red'><b>Tom/Brown/Tom Brown</b></font>)</div>said Tom to East; <div class="bookquote">``I should like it.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Tom/Brown/Tom Brown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Well, thank `ee, that's a good fellow. Just pull on your trousers, and
take your jug and mine. Tadpole will show you the way.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Tom/Brown/Tom Brown</b></font>)</div><p/>And so Tom and the Tadpole, in nightshirts and trousers, started off
downstairs, and through <div class="bookquote">``Thos's hole,''  (<font color='red'><b>Tom/Brown/Tom Brown</b></font>)</div>as the little buttery, where
candles and beer and bread and cheese were served out at night, was
called, across the School-house court, down a long passage, and into the
kitchen; where, after some parley with the stalwart, handsome cook, who
declared that she (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) had filled a dozen jugs already, they got their hot
water, and returned with all speed and great caution. As it was, they
narrowly escaped capture by some privateers from the fifth-form rooms,
who were on the lookout for the hot-water convoys, and pursued them up
to the very door of their room, making them spill half their load in the
passage.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Better than going down again though,''  (<font color='red'><b>Tadpole</b></font>)</div>as Tadpole remarked, <div class="bookquote">``as we
should have had to do if those beggars had caught us.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Tadpole</b></font>)</div><p/>By the time that the calling-over bell rang, Tom and his (<font color='blue'><b>Tom</b></font>) new
comrades were all down, dressed in their best clothes, and he (<font color='blue'><b>Tom</b></font>) had the
satisfaction of answering <div class="bookquote">``here''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>to his (<font color='blue'><b>Tom</b></font>) name for the first time, the
praepostor of the week having put it in at the bottom of his (<font color='blue'><b>Tom</b></font>) list. And
then came breakfast and a saunter about the close and town with East,
whose lameness only became severe when any fagging had to be done. And
so they whiled away the time until morning chapel.

<p/>It was a fine November morning, and the close soon became alive with
boys of all ages, who sauntered about on the grass, or walked round the
gravel walk, in parties of two or three. East, still doing the cicerone,
pointed out all the remarkable characters to Tom as they passed: Osbert,
who could throw a cricket-ball from the little-side ground over
the rook-trees to the Doctor's wall; Gray, who had got the Balliol
scholarship, and, what East evidently thought of much more importance,
a half-holiday for the School by his (<font color='blue'><b>Gray</b></font>) success; Thorne, who had run ten
miles in two minutes over the hour; Black, who had held his (<font color='blue'><b>Black</b></font>) own against
the cock of the town in the last row with the louts; and many more
heroes, who then and there walked about and were worshipped, all trace
of whom has long since vanished from the scene of their fame. And the
fourth-form boy who reads their names rudely cut on the old hall tables,
or painted upon the big-side cupboard -LRB-if hall tables and big-side
cupboards still exist-RRB-, wonders what manner of boys they were. It will
be the same with you who wonder, my sons, whatever your prowess may be
in cricket, or scholarship, or football. Two or three years, more or
less, and then the steadily advancing, blessed wave will pass over your
names as it has passed over ours. Nevertheless, play your games and do
your work manfully--see only that that be done--and let the remembrance
of it take care of itself.

<p/>The chapel-bell began to ring at a quarter to eleven, and Tom got in
early and took his (<font color='blue'><b>Tom</b></font>) place in the lowest row, and watched all the other
boys come in and take their places, filling row after row; and tried
to construe the Greek text which was inscribed over the door with the
slightest possible success, and wondered which of the masters, who
walked down the chapel and took their seats in the exalted boxes at the
end, would be his (<font color='blue'><b>Tom</b></font>) lord. And then came the closing of the doors, and the
Doctor in his (<font color='blue'><b>Doctor</b></font>) robes, and the service, which, however, didn't impress him (<font color='blue'><b>Doctor</b></font>)
much, for his (<font color='blue'><b>Doctor</b></font>) feeling of wonder and curiosity was too strong. And the
boy on one side of him (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>) was scratching his (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>) name on the oak panelling
in front, and he (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>) couldn't help watching to see what the name was, and
whether it was well scratched; and the boy on the other side went to
sleep, and kept falling against him (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>); and on the whole, though many boys
even in that part of the school were serious and attentive, the general
atmosphere was by no means devotional; and when he (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>) got out into the
close again, he (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>) didn't feel at all comfortable, or as if he (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>) had been to
church.

<p/>But at afternoon chapel it was quite another thing. He (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>) had spent the
time after dinner in writing home to his (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>) mother, and so was in a better
frame of mind; and his (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>) first curiosity was over, and he (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>) could attend
more to the service. As the hymn after the prayers was being sung, and
the chapel was getting a little dark, he (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>) was beginning to feel that he (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>)
had been really worshipping. And then came that great event in his (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>), as
in every Rugby boy's life of that day--the first sermon from the Doctor.

<p/>More worthy pens than mine have described that scene--the oak pulpit
standing out by itself above the School seats; the tall, gallant form,
the kindling eye, the voice, now soft as the low notes of a flute, now
clear and stirring as the call of the light-infantry bugle, of him (<font color='blue'><b>Doctor</b></font>) who
stood there Sunday after Sunday, witnessing and pleading for his (<font color='blue'><b>Doctor</b></font>) Lord,
the King of righteousness and love and glory, with whose Spirit he (<font color='blue'><b>Doctor</b></font>) was
filled, and in whose power he (<font color='blue'><b>Doctor</b></font>) spoke; the long lines of young faces,
rising tier above tier down the whole length of the chapel, from the
little boy's who had just left his (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>) mother to the young man's who was
going out next week into the great world, rejoicing in his (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>) strength.
It was a great and solemn sight, and never more so than at this time of
year, when the only lights in the chapel were in the pulpit and at the
seats of the praepostors of the week, and the soft twilight stole over
the rest of the chapel, deepening into darkness in the high gallery
behind the organ.

<p/>But what was it, after all, which seized and held these three hundred
boys, dragging them out of themselves, willing or unwilling, for twenty
minutes, on Sunday afternoons? True, there always were boys scattered up
and down the School, who in heart and head were worthy to hear and able
to carry away the deepest and wisest words there spoken. But these were
a minority always, generally a very small one, often so small a one as
to be countable on the fingers of your hand. What was it that moved
and held us, the rest of the three hundred reckless, childish boys, who
feared the Doctor with all our hearts, and very little besides in heaven
or earth; who thought more of our sets in the School than of the Church
of Christ, and put the traditions of Rugby and the public opinion of
boys in our daily life above the laws of God? We couldn't enter into
half that we heard; we hadn't the knowledge of our own hearts or the
knowledge of one another, and little enough of the faith, hope, and love
needed to that end. But we listened, as all boys in their better moods
will listen -LRB-ay, and men too for the matter of that-RRB-, to a man whom we
felt to be, with all his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) heart and soul and strength, striving against
whatever was mean and unmanly and unrighteous in our little world. It
was not the cold, clear voice of one giving advice and warning from
serene heights to those who were struggling and sinning below, but the
warm, living voice of one who was fighting for us and by our sides, and
calling on us to help him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) and ourselves and one another. And so, wearily
and little by little, but surely and steadily on the whole, was brought
home to the young boy, for the first time, the meaning of his (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>) life--that
it was no fool's or sluggard's paradise into which he (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>) had wandered
by chance, but a battlefield ordained from of old, where there are no
spectators, but the youngest must take his (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>) side, and the stakes are life
and death. And he (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>) who roused this consciousness in them showed them at
the same time, by every word he (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>) spoke in the pulpit, and by his (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>) whole
daily life, how that battle was to be fought, and stood there before
them their fellow-soldier and the captain of their band--the true sort
of captain, too, for a boy's army--one who had no misgivings, and gave
no uncertain word of command, and, let who would yield or make truce,
would fight the fight out -LRB-so every boy felt-RRB- to the last gasp and the
last drop of blood. Other sides of his (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>) character might take hold of
and influence boys here and there; but it was this thoroughness and
undaunted courage which, more than anything else, won his (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>) way to the
hearts of the great mass of those on whom he (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>) left his (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>) mark, and made
them believe first in him (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>) and then in his (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>) Master.

<p/>It was this quality above all others which moved such boys as our
hero, who had nothing whatever remarkable about him (<font color='blue'><b>hero</b></font>) except excess of
boyishness--by which I mean animal life in its fullest measure, good
nature and honest impulses, hatred of injustice and meanness, and
thoughtlessness enough to sink a three-decker. And so, during the next
two years, in which it was more than doubtful whether he (<font color='blue'><b>hero</b></font>) would get good
or evil from the School, and before any steady purpose or principle grew
up in him (<font color='blue'><b>hero</b></font>), whatever his (<font color='blue'><b>hero</b></font>) week's sins and shortcomings might have been, he (<font color='blue'><b>hero</b></font>)
hardly ever left the chapel on Sunday evenings without a serious resolve
to stand by and follow the Doctor, and a feeling that it was only
cowardice -LRB-the incarnation of all other sins in such a boy's mind-RRB- which
hindered him (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>) from doing so with all his (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>) heart.

<p/>The next day Tom was duly placed in the third form, and began his (<font color='blue'><b>Tom</b></font>)
lessons in a corner of the big School. He (<font color='blue'><b>Tom</b></font>) found the work very easy, as
he (<font color='blue'><b>Tom</b></font>) had been well grounded, and knew his (<font color='blue'><b>Tom</b></font>) grammar by heart; and, as he (<font color='blue'><b>Tom</b></font>) had
no intimate companions to make him (<font color='blue'><b>Tom</b></font>) idle -LRB-East and his (<font color='blue'><b>Tom</b></font>) other School-house
friends being in the lower fourth, the form above him (<font color='blue'><b>Tom</b></font>)-RRB-, soon gained
golden opinions from his (<font color='blue'><b>Tom</b></font>) master, who said he (<font color='blue'><b>Tom</b></font>) was placed too low, and
should be put out at the end of the half-year. So all went well with him (<font color='blue'><b>Tom</b></font>)
in School, and he (<font color='blue'><b>Tom</b></font>) wrote the most flourishing letters home to his (<font color='blue'><b>Tom</b></font>) mother,
full of his (<font color='blue'><b>Tom</b></font>) own success and the unspeakable delights of a public school.

<p/>In the house, too, all went well. The end of the half-year was drawing
near, which kept everybody in a good humour, and the house was ruled
well and strongly by Warner and Brooke. True, the general system was
rough and hard, and there was bullying in nooks and corners--bad signs
for the future; but it never got farther, or dared show itself openly,
stalking about the passages and hall and bedrooms, and making the life
of the small boys a continual fear.

<p/>Tom, as a new boy, was of right excused fagging for the first month, but
in his (<font color='blue'><b>Tom</b></font>) enthusiasm for his (<font color='blue'><b>Tom</b></font>) new life this privilege hardly pleased him (<font color='blue'><b>Tom</b></font>);
and East and others of his (<font color='blue'><b>Tom</b></font>) young friends, discovering this, kindly
allowed him (<font color='blue'><b>Tom</b></font>) to indulge his (<font color='blue'><b>Tom</b></font>) fancy, and take their turns at night fagging
and cleaning studies. These were the principal duties of the fags in the
house. From supper until nine o’clock three fags taken in order stood in
the passages, and answered any praepostor who called <div class="bookquote">``Fag,''  (<font color='red'><b>fags</b></font>)</div>racing to the
door, the last comer having to do the work. This consisted generally of
going to the buttery for beer and bread and cheese -LRB-for the great men
did not sup with the rest, but had each his (<font color='blue'><b>Tom</b></font>) own allowance in his (<font color='blue'><b>Tom</b></font>) study
or the fifth-form room-RRB-, cleaning candlesticks and putting in new
candles, toasting cheese, bottling beer, and carrying messages about the
house; and Tom, in the first blush of his (<font color='blue'><b>Tom</b></font>) hero-worship, felt it a high
privilege to receive orders from and be the bearer of the supper of old
Brooke. And besides this night-work, each praepostor had three or four
fags specially allotted to him (<font color='blue'><b>Tom</b></font>), of whom he (<font color='blue'><b>Tom</b></font>) was supposed to be the guide,
philosopher, and friend, and who in return for these good offices had to
clean out his (<font color='blue'><b>Tom</b></font>) study every morning by turns, directly after first lesson
and before he (<font color='blue'><b>Tom</b></font>) returned from breakfast. And the pleasure of seeing the
great men's studies, and looking at their pictures, and peeping into
their books, made Tom a ready substitute for any boy who was too lazy to
do his (<font color='blue'><b>Tom</b></font>) own work. And so he (<font color='blue'><b>Tom</b></font>) soon gained the character of a good-natured,
willing fellow, who was ready to do a turn for any one.

<p/>In all the games, too, he (<font color='blue'><b>Tom</b></font>) joined with all his (<font color='blue'><b>Tom</b></font>) heart, and soon became
well versed in all the mysteries of football, by continual practice at
the School-house little-side, which played daily.

<p/>The only incident worth recording here, however, was his (<font color='blue'><b>Tom</b></font>) first run at
hare-and-hounds. On the last Tuesday but one of the half-year he (<font color='blue'><b>Tom</b></font>) was
passing through the hall after dinner, when he (<font color='blue'><b>Tom</b></font>) was hailed with shouts
from Tadpole and several other fags seated at one of the long tables,
the chorus of which was, <div class="bookquote">``Come and help us tear up scent.''

 (<font color='red'><b>fags</b></font>)</div><p/>Tom approached the table in obedience to the mysterious summons, always
ready to help, and found the party engaged in tearing up old newspapers,
copy-books, and magazines, into small pieces, with which they were
filling four large canvas bags.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``It's the turn of our house to find scent for big-side hare-and-hounds,''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>exclaimed Tadpole. <div class="bookquote">``Tear away; there's no time to lose before
calling-over.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I think it's a great shame,''  (<font color='red'><b>another boy</b></font>)</div>said another small boy, <div class="bookquote">``to have such a
hard run for the last day.''

 (<font color='red'><b>another boy</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Which run is it?''  (<font color='red'><b>Tadpole</b></font>)</div>said Tadpole.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Oh, the Barby run, I hear,''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>answered the other; <div class="bookquote">``nine miles at least,
and hard ground; no chance of getting in at the finish, unless you're a
first-rate scud.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Well, I'm going to have a try,''  (<font color='red'><b>Tadpole</b></font>)</div>said Tadpole; <div class="bookquote">``it's the last run of the
half, and if a fellow gets in at the end big-side stands ale and bread
and cheese and a bowl of punch; and the Cock's such a famous place for
ale.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Tadpole</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I should like to try too,''  (<font color='red'><b>Tom/Brown/Tom Brown</b></font>)</div>said Tom.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Well, then, leave your waistcoat behind, and listen at the door, after
calling-over, and you'll hear where the meet is.''

 (<font color='red'><b>boys</b></font>)</div><p/>After calling-over, sure enough there were two boys at the door, calling
out, <div class="bookquote">``Big-side hare-and-hounds meet at White Hall;''  (<font color='red'><b>boys</b></font>)</div>and Tom, having
girded himself with leather strap, and left all superfluous clothing
behind, set off for White Hall, an old gable-ended house some quarter
of a mile from the town, with East, whom he (<font color='blue'><b>White</b></font>) had persuaded to join,
notwithstanding his (<font color='blue'><b>White</b></font>) prophecy that they could never get in, as it was the
hardest run of the year.

<p/>At the meet they found some forty or fifty boys, and Tom felt sure, from
having seen many of them run at football, that he (<font color='blue'><b>Tom</b></font>) and East were more
likely to get in than they.

<p/>After a few minutes' waiting, two well-known runners, chosen for the
hares, buckled on the four bags filled with scent, compared their
watches with those of young Brooke and Thorne, and started off at a
long, slinging trot across the fields in the direction of Barby.

<p/>Then the hounds clustered round Thorne, who explained shortly, <div class="bookquote">``They're
to have six minutes' law. We run into the Cock, and every one who comes
in within a quarter of an hour of the hares'll be counted, if he (<font color='blue'><b>White</b></font>) has
been round Barby church.''  (<font color='red'><b>Thorne</b></font>)</div>Then came a minute's pause or so, and then the
watches are pocketed, and the pack is led through the gateway into the
field which the hares had first crossed. Here they break into a trot,
scattering over the field to find the first traces of the scent which
the hares throw out as they go along. The old hounds make straight for
the likely points, and in a minute a cry of <div class="bookquote">``Forward''  (<font color='red'><b>the boy</b></font>)</div>comes from one
of them, and the whole pack, quickening their pace, make for the spot,
while the boy who hit the scent first, and the two or three nearest to
him (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>), are over the first fence, and making play along the hedgerow in the
long grass-field beyond. The rest of the pack rush at the gap already
made, and scramble through, jostling one another. <div class="bookquote">``Forward''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>again,
before they are half through. The pace quickens into a sharp run, the
tail hounds all straining to get up to the lucky leaders. They are
gallant hares, and the scent lies thick right across another meadow and
into a ploughed field, where the pace begins to tell; then over a good
wattle with a ditch on the other side, and down a large pasture studded
with old thorns, which slopes down to the first brook. The great
Leicestershire sheep charge away across the field as the pack comes
racing down the slope. The brook is a small one, and the scent lies
right ahead up the opposite slope, and as thick as ever--not a turn or
a check to favour the tail hounds, who strain on, now trailing in a long
line, many a youngster beginning to drag his (<font color='blue'><b>youngster</b></font>) legs heavily, and feel his (<font color='blue'><b>youngster</b></font>)
heart beat like a hammer, and the bad-plucked ones thinking that after
all it isn't worth while to keep it up.

<p/>Tom, East, and the Tadpole had a good start, and are well up for such
young hands, and after rising the slope and crossing the next field,
find themselves up with the leading hounds, who have overrun the scent,
and are trying back. They have come a mile and a half in about eleven
minutes, a pace which shows that it is the last day. About twenty-five
of the original starters only show here, the rest having already given
in; the leaders are busy making casts into the fields on the left and
right, and the others get their second winds.

<p/>Then comes the cry of <div class="bookquote">``Forward''  (<font color='red'><b>Brooke</b></font>)</div>again from young Brooke, from the
extreme left, and the pack settles down to work again steadily and
doggedly, the whole keeping pretty well together. The scent, though
still good, is not so thick; there is no need of that, for in this part
of the run every one knows the line which must be taken, and so there
are no casts to be made, but good downright running and fencing to be
done. All who are now up mean coming in, and they come to the foot of
Barby Hill without losing more than two or three more of the pack. This
last straight two miles and a half is always a vantage ground for the
hounds, and the hares know it well; they are generally viewed on the
side of Barby Hill, and all eyes are on the lookout for them to-day. But
not a sign of them appears, so now will be the hard work for the hounds,
and there is nothing for it but to cast about for the scent, for it is
now the hares' turn, and they may baffle the pack dreadfully in the next
two miles.

<p/>Ill fares it now with our youngsters, that they are School-house boys,
and so follow young Brooke, for he (<font color='blue'><b>it</b></font>) takes the wide casts round to the
left, conscious of his (<font color='blue'><b>it</b></font>) own powers, and loving the hard work. For if you
would consider for a moment, you small boys, you would remember that the
Cock, where the run ends and the good ale will be going, lies far out to
the right on the Dunchurch road, so that every cast you take to the left
is so much extra work. And at this stage of the run, when the evening is
closing in already, no one remarks whether you run a little cunning or
not; so you should stick to those crafty hounds who keep edging away to
the right, and not follow a prodigal like young Brooke, whose legs are
twice as long as yours and of cast-iron, wholly indifferent to one or
two miles more or less. However, they struggle after him (<font color='blue'><b>you</b></font>), sobbing and
plunging along, Tom and East pretty close, and Tadpole, whose big head
begins to pull him (<font color='blue'><b>Tom</b></font>) down, some thirty yards behind.

<p/>Now comes a brook, with stiff clay banks, from which they can hardly
drag their legs, and they hear faint cries for help from the wretched
Tadpole, who has fairly stuck fast. But they have too little run left
in themselves to pull up for their own brothers. Three fields more, and
another check, and then <div class="bookquote">``Forward''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>called away to the extreme right.

<p/>The two boys' souls die within them; they can never do it. Young Brooke
thinks so too, and says kindly, <div class="bookquote">``You'll cross a lane after next field;
keep down it, and you'll hit the Dunchurch road below the Cock,''  (<font color='red'><b>Brooke</b></font>)</div>and
then steams away for the run in, in which he (<font color='blue'><b>Young</b></font>)'s sure to be first, as
if he (<font color='blue'><b>Young</b></font>) were just starting. They struggle on across the next field, the
<div class="bookquote">``forwards''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>getting fainter and fainter, and then ceasing. The whole hunt
is out of ear-shot, and all hope of coming in is over.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Hang it all!''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>broke out East, as soon as he (<font color='blue'><b>Young</b></font>) had got wind enough,
pulling off his (<font color='blue'><b>Young</b></font>) hat and mopping at his (<font color='blue'><b>Young</b></font>) face, all spattered with dirt and
lined with sweat, from which went up a thick steam into the still, cold
air. <div class="bookquote">``I told you how it would be. What a thick I was to come! Here we
are, dead beat, and yet I know we're close to the run in, if we knew the
country.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Well,''  (<font color='red'><b>Tom/Brown/Tom Brown</b></font>)</div>said Tom, mopping away, and gulping down his (<font color='blue'><b>Tom</b></font>) disappointment,
<div class="bookquote">``it can't be helped. We did our best anyhow. Hadn't we better find this
lane, and go down it, as young Brooke told us?''

 (<font color='red'><b>Tom/Brown/Tom Brown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I suppose so--nothing else for it,''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>grunted East. <div class="bookquote">``If ever I go out
last day again.''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>Growl, growl, growl.

<p/>So they tried back slowly and sorrowfully, and found the lane, and went
limping down it, plashing in the cold puddly ruts, and beginning to feel
how the run had taken it out of them. The evening closed in fast, and
clouded over, dark, cold, and dreary.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``I say, it must be locking-up, I should think,''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>remarked East, breaking
the silence--<div class="bookquote">``it's so dark.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``What if we're late?''  (<font color='red'><b>Tom/Brown/Tom Brown</b></font>)</div>said Tom.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``No tea, and sent up to the Doctor,''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>answered East.

<p/>The thought didn't add to their cheerfulness. Presently a faint halloo
was heard from an adjoining field. They answered it and stopped, hoping
for some competent rustic to guide them, when over a gate some twenty
yards ahead crawled the wretched Tadpole, in a state of collapse. He (<font color='blue'><b>Tom</b></font>) had
lost a shoe in the brook, and had been groping after it up to his (<font color='blue'><b>Tom</b></font>) elbows
in the stiff, wet clay, and a more miserable creature in the shape of
boy seldom has been seen.

<p/>The sight of him (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>), notwithstanding, cheered them, for he (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>) was some degrees
more wretched than they. They also cheered him (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>), as he (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>) was no longer
under the dread of passing his (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>) night alone in the fields. And so, in
better heart, the three plashed painfully down the never-ending lane. At
last it widened, just as utter darkness set in, and they came out on
a turnpike road, and there paused, bewildered, for they had lost all
bearings, and knew not whether to turn to the right or left.

<p/>Luckily for them they had not to decide, for lumbering along the road,
with one lamp lighted and two spavined horses in the shafts, came a
heavy coach, which after a moment's suspense they recognized as the
Oxford coach, the redoubtable Pig and Whistle.

<p/>It lumbered slowly up, and the boys, mustering their last run, caught
it as it passed, and began clambering up behind, in which exploit East
missed his (<font color='blue'><b>coach</b></font>) footing and fell flat on his (<font color='blue'><b>coach</b></font>) nose along the road. Then the
others hailed the old scarecrow of a coachman, who pulled up and agreed
to take them in for a shilling; so there they sat on the back seat,
drubbing with their heels, and their teeth chattering with cold, and
jogged into Rugby some forty minutes after locking-up.

<p/>Five minutes afterwards three small, limping, shivering figures steal
along through the Doctor's garden, and into the house by the servants'
entrance -LRB-all the other gates have been closed long since-RRB-, where the
first thing they light upon in the passage is old Thomas, ambling along,
candle in one hand and keys in the other.

<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Thomas</b></font>) stops and examines their condition with a grim smile. <div class="bookquote">``Ah! East,
Hall, and Brown, late for locking-up. Must go up to the Doctor's study
at once.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Well but, Thomas, mayn't we go and wash first? You can put down the
time, you know.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Doctor's study d’rectly you come in--that's the orders,''  (<font color='red'><b>Thomas/Thomas Hughes</b></font>)</div>replied old
Thomas, motioning towards the stairs at the end of the passage which led
up into the Doctor's house; and the boys turned ruefully down it, not
cheered by the old verger's muttered remark, <div class="bookquote">``What a pickle they boys be
in!''  (<font color='red'><b>the verger</b></font>)</div>Thomas referred to their faces and habiliments, but they construed
it as indicating the Doctor's state of mind. Upon the short flight of
stairs they paused to hold counsel.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Who'll go in first?''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>inquires Tadpole.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``You--you're the senior,''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>answered East.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Catch me. Look at the state I'm in,''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>rejoined Hall, showing the arms of
his (<font color='blue'><b>counsel</b></font>) jacket. <div class="bookquote">``I must get behind you two.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Well, but look at me,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>said East, indicating the mass of clay behind
which he (<font color='blue'><b>counsel</b></font>) was standing; <div class="bookquote">``I'm worse than you, two to one. You might grow
cabbages on my trousers.''

 (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``That's all down below, and you can keep your legs behind the sofa,''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>said Hall.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Here, Brown; you're the show-figure. You must lead.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``But my face is all muddy,''  (<font color='red'><b>Tom/Brown/Tom Brown</b></font>)</div>argued Tom.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Oh, we're all in one boat for that matter; but come on; we're only
making it worse, dawdling here.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Well, just give us a brush then,''  (<font color='red'><b>Tom/Brown/Tom Brown</b></font>)</div>said Tom. And they began trying to
rub off the superfluous dirt from each other's jackets; but it was not
dry enough, and the rubbing made them worse; so in despair they pushed
through the swing-door at the head of the stairs, and found themselves
in the Doctor's hall.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``That's the library door,''  (<font color='red'><b>Tom/Brown/Tom Brown</b></font>)</div>said East in a whisper, pushing Tom forwards.
The sound of merry voices and laughter came from within, and his (<font color='blue'><b>Tom</b></font>) first
hesitating knock was unanswered. But at the second, the Doctor's voice
said, <div class="bookquote">``Come in;''  (<font color='red'><b>the Doctor</b></font>)</div>and Tom turned the handle, and he (<font color='blue'><b>Tom</b></font>), with the others
behind him (<font color='blue'><b>Tom</b></font>), sidled into the room.

<p/>The Doctor looked up from his (<font color='blue'><b>Doctor</b></font>) task; he (<font color='blue'><b>Doctor</b></font>) was working away with a great
chisel at the bottom of a boy's sailing boat, the lines of which he (<font color='blue'><b>Doctor</b></font>) was
no doubt fashioning on the model of one of Nicias's galleys. Round him (<font color='blue'><b>Doctor</b></font>)
stood three or four children; the candles burnt brightly on a large
table at the farther end, covered with books and papers, and a great
fire threw a ruddy glow over the rest of the room. All looked so kindly,
and homely, and comfortable that the boys took heart in a moment, and
Tom advanced from behind the shelter of the great sofa. The Doctor
nodded to the children, who went out, casting curious and amused glances
at the three young scarecrows.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Well, my little fellows,''  (<font color='red'><b>the Doctor</b></font>)</div>began the Doctor, drawing himself up with
his (<font color='blue'><b>Doctor</b></font>) back to the fire, the chisel in one hand and his (<font color='blue'><b>Doctor</b></font>) coat-tails in the
other, and his (<font color='blue'><b>Doctor</b></font>) eyes twinkling as he (<font color='blue'><b>Doctor</b></font>) looked them over; <div class="bookquote">``what makes you so
late?''

 (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Please, sir, we've been out big-side hare-and-hounds, and lost our
way.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Hah! you couldn't keep up, I suppose?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Well, sir,''  (<font color='red'><b>the Doctor</b></font>)</div>said East, stepping out, and not liking that the Doctor
should think lightly of his (<font color='blue'><b>Doctor</b></font>) running powers, <div class="bookquote">``we got round Barby all
right; but then--''

 (<font color='red'><b>the Doctor</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Why, what a state you're in, my boy!''  (<font color='red'><b>the Doctor</b></font>)</div>interrupted the Doctor, as the
pitiful condition of East's garments was fully revealed to him (<font color='blue'><b>Doctor</b></font>).

<p/><div class="bookquote">``That's the fall I got, sir, in the road,''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>said East, looking down at
himself; <div class="bookquote">``the Old Pig came by--''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``The what?''  (<font color='red'><b>the Doctor</b></font>)</div>said the Doctor.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``The Oxford coach, sir,''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>explained Hall.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Hah! yes, the Regulator,''  (<font color='red'><b>the Doctor</b></font>)</div>said the Doctor.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``And I tumbled on my face, trying to get up behind,''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>went on East.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``You're not hurt, I hope?''  (<font color='red'><b>the Doctor</b></font>)</div>said the Doctor.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Oh no, sir.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Well now, run upstairs, all three of you, and get clean things on, and
then tell the housekeeper to give you some tea. You're too young to try
such long runs. Let Warner know I've seen you. Good-night.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Good-night, sir.''  (<font color='red'><b>the boys</b></font>)</div>And away scuttled the three boys in high glee.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``What a brick, not to give us even twenty lines to learn!''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>said the
Tadpole, as they reached their bedroom; and in half an hour afterwards
they were sitting by the fire in the housekeeper's room at a sumptuous
tea, with cold meat--<div class="bookquote">``Twice as good a grub as we should have got in the
hall,''  (<font color='red'><b>the housekeeper</b></font>)</div>as the Tadpole remarked with a grin, his (<font color='blue'><b>Doctor</b></font>) mouth full of buttered
toast. All their grievances were forgotten, and they were resolving to
go out the first big-side next half, and thinking hare-and-hounds the
most delightful of games.

<p/>A day or two afterwards the great passage outside the bedrooms was
cleared of the boxes and portmanteaus, which went down to be packed by
the matron, and great games of chariot-racing, and cock-fighting, and
bolstering went on in the vacant space, the sure sign of a closing
half-year.

<p/>Then came the making up of parties for the journey home, and Tom joined
a party who were to hire a coach, and post with four horses to Oxford.

<p/>Then the last Saturday, on which the Doctor came round to each form to
give out the prizes, and hear the master's last reports of how they
and their charges had been conducting themselves; and Tom, to his (<font color='blue'><b>Tom</b></font>) huge
delight, was praised, and got his (<font color='blue'><b>Tom</b></font>) remove into the lower fourth, in which
all his (<font color='blue'><b>Tom</b></font>) School-house friends were.

<p/>On the next Tuesday morning at four o’clock hot coffee was going on in
the housekeeper's and matron's rooms; boys wrapped in great-coats and
mufflers were swallowing hasty mouthfuls, rushing about, tumbling over
luggage, and asking questions all at once of the matron; outside the
School-gates were drawn up several chaises and the four-horse coach
which Tom's party had chartered, the postboys in their best jackets and
breeches, and a cornopean player, hired for the occasion, blowing away
<div class="bookquote">``A southerly wind and a cloudy sky,''  (<font color='red'><b>a player</b></font>)</div>waking all peaceful inhabitants
half-way down the High Street.

<p/>Every minute the bustle and hubbub increased: porters staggered about
with boxes and bags, the cornopean played louder. Old Thomas sat in
his (<font color='blue'><b>Thomas</b></font>) den with a great yellow bag by his (<font color='blue'><b>Thomas</b></font>) side, out of which he (<font color='blue'><b>Thomas</b></font>) was paying
journey-money to each boy, comparing by the light of a solitary dip the
dirty, crabbed little list in his (<font color='blue'><b>Thomas</b></font>) own handwriting with the Doctor's list
and the amount of his (<font color='blue'><b>Thomas</b></font>) cash; his (<font color='blue'><b>Thomas</b></font>) head was on one side, his (<font color='blue'><b>Thomas</b></font>) mouth screwed
up, and his (<font color='blue'><b>Thomas</b></font>) spectacles dim from early toil. He (<font color='blue'><b>Thomas</b></font>) had prudently locked the
door, and carried on his (<font color='blue'><b>Thomas</b></font>) operations solely through the window, or he (<font color='blue'><b>Thomas</b></font>)
would have been driven wild and lost all his (<font color='blue'><b>Thomas</b></font>) money.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Thomas, do be quick; we shall never catch the Highflyer at Dunchurch.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``That's your money all right, Green.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Hullo, Thomas, the Doctor said I was to have two pound ten; you've only
given me two pound.''  (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div>-LRB-I fear that Master Green is not confining himself
strictly to truth.-RRB- Thomas turns his (<font color='blue'><b>Thomas</b></font>) head more on one side than ever,
and spells away at the dirty list. Green is forced away from the window.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Here, Thomas--never mind him (<font color='blue'><b>Thomas</b></font>); mine's thirty shillings.''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``And mine too,''
 (<font color='red'><b>others</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``And mine,''  (<font color='red'><b>others</b></font>)</div>shouted others.

<p/>One way or another, the party to which Tom belonged all got packed and
paid, and sallied out to the gates, the cornopean playing frantically
<div class="bookquote">``Drops of Brandy,''  (<font color='red'><b>Tom/Brown/Tom Brown</b></font>)</div>in allusion, probably, to the slight potations in
which the musician and postboys had been already indulging. All luggage
was carefully stowed away inside the coach and in the front and hind
boots, so that not a hat-box was visible outside. Five or six small
boys, with pea-shooters, and the cornopean player, got up behind; in
front the big boys, mostly smoking, not for pleasure, but because they
are now gentlemen at large, and this is the most correct public method
of notifying the fact.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Robinson's coach will be down the road in a minute; it has gone up to
Bird's to pick up. We'll wait till they're close, and make a race of
it,''  (<font color='red'><b>the leader</b></font>)</div>says the leader. <div class="bookquote">``Now, boys, half a sovereign apiece if you beat
`em into Dunchurch by one hundred yards.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``All right, sir,''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>shouted the grinning postboys.

<p/>Down comes Robinson's coach in a minute or two, with a rival cornopean,
and away go the two vehicles, horses galloping, boys cheering, horns
playing loud. There is a special providence over school-boys as well
as sailors, or they must have upset twenty times in the first five
miles--sometimes actually abreast of one another, and the boys on the
roofs exchanging volleys of peas; now nearly running over a post-chaise
which had started before them; now half-way up a bank; now with a wheel
and a half over a yawning ditch: and all this in a dark morning, with
nothing but their own lamps to guide them. However, it's all over at
last, and they have run over nothing but an old pig in Southam Street.
The last peas are distributed in the Corn Market at Oxford, where they
arrive between eleven and twelve, and sit down to a sumptuous breakfast
at the Angel, which they are made to pay for accordingly. Here the party
breaks up, all going now different ways; and Tom orders out a chaise and
pair as grand as a lord, though he (<font color='blue'><b>lord</b></font>) has scarcely five shillings left in
his (<font color='blue'><b>lord</b></font>) pocket, and more than twenty miles to get home.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Where to, sir?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Red Lion, Farringdon,''  (<font color='red'><b>Tom/Brown/Tom Brown</b></font>)</div>says Tom, giving hostler a shilling.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``All right, sir.--Red Lion, Jem,''  (<font color='red'><b>Tom/Brown/Tom Brown</b></font>)</div>to the postboy; and Tom rattles away
towards home. At Farringdon, being known to the innkeeper, he (<font color='blue'><b>Tom</b></font>) gets that
worthy to pay for the Oxford horses, and forward him (<font color='blue'><b>Tom</b></font>) in another chaise
at once; and so the gorgeous young gentleman arrives at the paternal
mansion, and Squire Brown looks rather blue at having to pay two pound
ten shillings for the posting expenses from Oxford. But the boy's
intense joy at getting home, and the wonderful health he (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>) is in, and the
good character he (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>) brings, and the brave stories he (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>) tells of Rugby, its
doings and delights, soon mollify the Squire, and three happier people
didn't sit down to dinner that day in England -LRB-it is the boy's first
dinner at six o’clock at home--great promotion already-RRB- than the Squire
and his (<font color='blue'><b>Squire</b></font>) wife and Tom Brown, at the end of his (<font color='blue'><b>Squire</b></font>) first half-year at Rugby.



<p/>CHAPTER VIII--THE WAR OF INDEPENDENCE.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``They are slaves who will not choose
Hatred, scoffing, and abuse,
Rather than in silence shrink
From the truth they needs must think;
They are slaves who dare not be
In the right with two or three.''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>--LOWELL, Stanzas on Freedom.

<p/>The lower-fourth form, in which Tom found himself at the beginning
of the next half-year, was the largest form in the lower school, and
numbered upwards of forty boys. Young gentlemen of all ages from nine to
fifteen were to be found there, who expended such part of their energies
as was devoted to Latin and Greek upon a book of Livy, the <div class="bookquote">``Bucolics''
 (<font color='red'><b>Livy Bucolics</b></font>)</div>of Virgil, and the <div class="bookquote">``Hecuba''  (<font color='red'><b>Virgil</b></font>)</div>of Euripides, which were ground out in small
daily portions. The driving of this unlucky lower-fourth must have been
grievous work to the unfortunate master, for it was the most unhappily
constituted of any in the school. Here stuck the great stupid boys,
who, for the life of them, could never master the accidence--the objects
alternately of mirth and terror to the youngsters, who were daily taking
them up and laughing at them in lesson, and getting kicked by them for
so doing in play-hours. There were no less than three unhappy fellows in
tail coats, with incipient down on their chins, whom the Doctor and
the master of the form were always endeavouring to hoist into the upper
school, but whose parsing and construing resisted the most well-meant
shoves. Then came the mass of the form, boys of eleven and twelve, the
most mischievous and reckless age of British youth, of whom East and Tom
Brown were fair specimens. As full of tricks as monkeys, and of excuses
as Irishwomen, making fun of their master, one another, and their
lessons, Argus himself would have been puzzled to keep an eye on them;
and as for making them steady or serious for half an hour together,
it was simply hopeless. The remainder of the form consisted of young
prodigies of nine and ten, who were going up the school at the rate of
a form a half-year, all boys' hands and wits being against them in their
progress. It would have been one man's work to see that the precocious
youngsters had fair play; and as the master had a good deal besides
to do, they hadn't, and were for ever being shoved down three or four
places, their verses stolen, their books inked, their jackets whitened,
and their lives otherwise made a burden to them.

<p/>The lower-fourth, and all the forms below it, were heard in the great
school, and were not trusted to prepare their lessons before coming in,
but were whipped into school three-quarters of an hour before the lesson
began by their respective masters, and there, scattered about on the
benches, with dictionary and grammar, hammered out their twenty lines
of Virgil and Euripides in the midst of babel. The masters of the
lower school walked up and down the great school together during this
three-quarters of an hour, or sat in their desks reading or looking over
copies, and keeping such order as was possible. But the lower-fourth
was just now an overgrown form, too large for any one man to attend
to properly, and consequently the elysium or ideal form of the young
scapegraces who formed the staple of it.

<p/>Tom, as has been said, had come up from the third with a good character,
but the temptations of the lower-fourth soon proved too strong for him (<font color='blue'><b>character</b></font>),
and he (<font color='blue'><b>character</b></font>) rapidly fell away, and became as unmanageable as the rest.
For some weeks, indeed, he (<font color='blue'><b>character</b></font>) succeeded in maintaining the appearance of
steadiness, and was looked upon favourably by his (<font color='blue'><b>character</b></font>) new master, whose eyes
were first opened by the following little incident.

<p/>Besides the desk which the master himself occupied, there was another
large unoccupied desk in the corner of the great school, which was
untenanted. To rush and seize upon this desk, which was ascended by
three steps and held four boys, was the great object of ambition of the
lower-fourthers; and the contentions for the occupation of it bred such
disorder that at last the master forbade its use altogether. This, of
course, was a challenge to the more adventurous spirits to occupy it;
and as it was capacious enough for two boys to lie hid there completely,
it was seldom that it remained empty, notwithstanding the veto. Small
holes were cut in the front, through which the occupants watched the
masters as they walked up and down; and as lesson time approached, one
boy at a time stole out and down the steps, as the masters' backs were
turned, and mingled with the general crowd on the forms below. Tom and
East had successfully occupied the desk some half-dozen times, and were
grown so reckless that they were in the habit of playing small games
with fives balls inside when the masters were at the other end of the
big school. One day, as ill-luck would have it, the game became more
exciting than usual, and the ball slipped through East's fingers, and
rolled slowly down the steps and out into the middle of the school, just
as the masters turned in their walk and faced round upon the desk. The
young delinquents watched their master, through the lookout holes, march
slowly down the school straight upon their retreat, while all the boys
in the neighbourhood, of course, stopped their work to look on; and not
only were they ignominiously drawn out, and caned over the hand then
and there, but their characters for steadiness were gone from that time.
However, as they only shared the fate of some three-fourths of the rest
of the form, this did not weigh heavily upon them.

<p/>In fact, the only occasions on which they cared about the matter were
the monthly examinations, when the Doctor came round to examine their
form, for one long, awful hour, in the work which they had done in the
preceding month. The second monthly examination came round soon after
Tom's fall, and it was with anything but lively anticipations that he (<font color='blue'><b>Tom</b></font>)
and the other lower-fourth boys came in to prayers on the morning of the
examination day.

<p/>Prayers and calling-over seemed twice as short as usual, and before they
could get construes of a tithe of the hard passages marked in the margin
of their books, they were all seated round, and the Doctor was standing
in the middle, talking in whispers to the master. Tom couldn't hear a
word which passed, and never lifted his (<font color='blue'><b>Tom</b></font>) eyes from his (<font color='blue'><b>Tom</b></font>) book; but he (<font color='blue'><b>Tom</b></font>) knew
by a sort of magnetic instinct that the Doctor's under-lip was coming
out, and his (<font color='blue'><b>Doctor</b></font>) eye beginning to burn, and his (<font color='blue'><b>Doctor</b></font>) gown getting gathered up
more and more tightly in his (<font color='blue'><b>Doctor</b></font>) left hand. The suspense was agonizing, and
Tom knew that he (<font color='blue'><b>Tom</b></font>) was sure on such occasions to make an example of the
School-house boys. <div class="bookquote">``If he (<font color='blue'><b>Lion</b></font>) would only begin,''  (<font color='red'><b>Tom/Brown/Tom Brown</b></font>)</div>thought Tom, <div class="bookquote">``I shouldn't
mind.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Tom/Brown/Tom Brown</b></font>)</div><p/>At last the whispering ceased, and the name which was called out was not
Brown. He (<font color='blue'><b>Brown</b></font>) looked up for a moment, but the Doctor's face was too awful;
Tom wouldn't have met his (<font color='blue'><b>Tom</b></font>) eye for all he (<font color='blue'><b>Tom</b></font>) was worth, and buried himself
in his (<font color='blue'><b>Tom</b></font>) book again.

<p/>The boy who was called up first was a clever, merry School-house boy,
one of their set; he (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>) was some connection of the Doctor's, and a great
favourite, and ran in and out of his (<font color='blue'><b>Doctor</b></font>) house as he (<font color='blue'><b>Doctor</b></font>) liked, and so was
selected for the first victim.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Triste lupus stabulis,''  (<font color='red'><b>the youngster</b></font>)</div>began the luckless youngster, and stammered
through some eight or ten lines.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``There, that will do,''  (<font color='red'><b>the Doctor</b></font>)</div>said the Doctor; <div class="bookquote">``now construe.''

 (<font color='red'><b>the Doctor</b></font>)</div><p/>On common occasions the boy could have construed the passage well enough
probably, but now his (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>) head was gone.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Triste lupus, the sorrowful wolf,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>) began.

<p/>A shudder ran through the whole form, and the Doctor's wrath fairly
boiled over. He (<font color='blue'><b>Doctor</b></font>) made three steps up to the construer, and gave him (<font color='blue'><b>Doctor</b></font>) a
good box on the ear. The blow was not a hard one, but the boy was so
taken by surprise that he (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>) started back; the form caught the back of his (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>)
knees, and over he (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>) went on to the floor behind. There was a dead silence
over the whole school. Never before and never again while Tom was at
school did the Doctor strike a boy in lesson. The provocation must have
been great. However, the victim had saved his (<font color='blue'><b>victim</b></font>) form for that occasion,
for the Doctor turned to the top bench, and put on the best boys for the
rest of the hour and though, at the end of the lesson, he (<font color='blue'><b>Doctor</b></font>) gave them all
such a rating as they did not forget, this terrible field-day passed
over without any severe visitations in the shape of punishments or
floggings. Forty young scapegraces expressed their thanks to the
<div class="bookquote">``sorrowful wolf''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>in their different ways before second lesson.

<p/>But a character for steadiness once gone is not easily recovered, as Tom
found; and for years afterwards he (<font color='blue'><b>Tom</b></font>) went up the school without it,
and the masters' hands were against him (<font color='blue'><b>Tom</b></font>), and his (<font color='blue'><b>Tom</b></font>) against them. And he (<font color='blue'><b>Tom</b></font>)
regarded them, as a matter of course, as his (<font color='blue'><b>Tom</b></font>) natural enemies.

<p/>Matters were not so comfortable, either, in the house as they had
been; for old Brooke left at Christmas, and one or two others of the
sixth-form boys at the following Easter. Their rule had been rough, but
strong and just in the main, and a higher standard was beginning to be
set up; in fact, there had been a short foretaste of the good time which
followed some years later. Just now, however, all threatened to return
into darkness and chaos again. For the new praepostors were either small
young boys, whose cleverness had carried them up to the top of the
school, while in strength of body and character they were not yet
fit for a share in the government; or else big fellows of the wrong
sort--boys whose friendships and tastes had a downward tendency, who had
not caught the meaning of their position and work, and felt none of its
responsibilities. So under this no-government the School-house began to
see bad times. The big fifth-form boys, who were a sporting and drinking
set, soon began to usurp power, and to fag the little boys as if they
were praepostors, and to bully and oppress any who showed signs of
resistance. The bigger sort of sixth-form boys just described soon made
common cause with the fifth, while the smaller sort, hampered by their
colleagues' desertion to the enemy, could not make head against them.
So the fags were without their lawful masters and protectors, and ridden
over rough-shod by a set of boys whom they were not bound to obey, and
whose only right over them stood in their bodily powers; and, as old
Brooke had prophesied, the house by degrees broke up into small sets and
parties, and lost the strong feeling of fellowship which he (<font color='blue'><b>boys</b></font>) set so much
store by, and with it much of the prowess in games and the lead in all
school matters which he (<font color='blue'><b>boys</b></font>) had done so much to keep up.

<p/>In no place in the world has individual character more weight than at
a public school. Remember this, I beseech you, all you boys who are
getting into the upper forms. Now is the time in all your lives,
probably, when you may have more wide influence for good or evil on the
society you live in than you ever can have again. Quit yourselves like
men, then; speak up, and strike out if necessary, for whatsoever
is true, and manly, and lovely, and of good report; never try to be
popular, but only to do your duty and help others to do theirs, and you
may leave the tone of feeling in the school higher than you found it,
and so be doing good which no living soul can measure to generations of
your countrymen yet unborn. For boys follow one another in herds like
sheep, for good or evil; they hate thinking, and have rarely any settled
principles. Every school, indeed, has its own traditionary standard of
right and wrong, which cannot be transgressed with impunity, marking
certain things as low and blackguard, and certain others as lawful and
right. This standard is ever varying, though it changes only slowly and
little by little; and, subject only to such standard, it is the leading
boys for the time being who give the tone to all the rest, and make
the School either a noble institution for the training of Christian
Englishmen, or a place where a young boy will get more evil than he (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>)
would if he (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>) were turned out to make his (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>) way in London streets, or
anything between these two extremes.

<p/>The change for the worse in the School-house, however, didn't press very
heavily on our youngsters for some time. They were in a good bedroom,
where slept the only praepostor left who was able to keep thorough order,
and their study was in his (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>) passage. So, though they were fagged more or
less, and occasionally kicked or cuffed by the bullies, they were, on
the whole, well off; and the fresh, brave school-life, so full of games,
adventures, and good-fellowship, so ready at forgetting, so capacious
at enjoying, so bright at forecasting, outweighed a thousand-fold their
troubles with the master of their form, and the occasional ill-usage
of the big boys in the house. It wasn't till some year or so after the
events recorded above that the praepostor of their room and passage left.
None of the other sixth-form boys would move into their passage, and, to
the disgust and indignation of Tom and East, one morning after breakfast
they were seized upon by Flashman, and made to carry down his (<font color='blue'><b>Tom</b></font>) books and
furniture into the unoccupied study, which he (<font color='blue'><b>Tom</b></font>) had taken. From this
time they began to feel the weight of the tyranny of Flashman and his (<font color='blue'><b>Tom</b></font>)
friends, and, now that trouble had come home to their own doors, began
to look out for sympathizers and partners amongst the rest of the fags;
and meetings of the oppressed began to be held, and murmurs to arise,
and plots to be laid as to how they should free themselves and be
avenged on their enemies.

<p/>While matters were in this state, East and Tom were one evening sitting
in their study. They had done their work for first lesson, and Tom was
in a brown study, brooding, like a young William Tell, upon the wrongs
of fags in general, and his (<font color='blue'><b>William</b></font>) own in particular.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``I say, Scud,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>said he (<font color='blue'><b>William</b></font>) at last, rousing himself to snuff the candle,
<div class="bookquote">``what right have the fifth-form boys to fag us as they do?''

 (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``No more right than you have to fag them,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>answered East, without
looking up from an early number of <div class="bookquote">``Pickwick,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>which was just coming
out, and which he (<font color='blue'><b>William</b></font>) was luxuriously devouring, stretched on his (<font color='blue'><b>William</b></font>) back on
the sofa.

<p/>Tom relapsed into his (<font color='blue'><b>Tom</b></font>) brown study, and East went on reading and
chuckling. The contrast of the boys' faces would have given infinite
amusement to a looker-on--the one so solemn and big with mighty purpose,
the other radiant and bubbling over with fun.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Do you know, old fellow, I've been thinking it over a good deal,''  (<font color='red'><b>Tom/Brown/Tom Brown</b></font>)</div>began
Tom again.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Oh yes, I know--fagging you are thinking of. Hang it all! But listen
here, Tom--here's fun. Mr. Winkle's horse--''

 (<font color='red'><b>Tom/Brown/Tom Brown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``And I've made up my mind,''  (<font color='red'><b>Tom/Brown/Tom Brown</b></font>)</div>broke in Tom, <div class="bookquote">``that I won't fag except for
the sixth.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Tom/Brown/Tom Brown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Quite right too, my boy,''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>cried East, putting his (<font color='blue'><b>Tom</b></font>) finger on the place
and looking up; <div class="bookquote">``but a pretty peck of troubles you'll get into, if
you're going to play that game. However, I'm all for a strike myself, if
we can get others to join. It's getting too bad.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Can't we get some sixth-form fellow to take it up?''  (<font color='red'><b>Tom/Brown/Tom Brown</b></font>)</div>asked Tom.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Well, perhaps we might. Morgan would interfere, I think. Only,''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>added
East, after a moment's pause, <div class="bookquote">``you see, we should have to tell him (<font color='blue'><b>Morgan</b></font>) about
it, and that's against School principles. Don't you remember what old
Brooke said about learning to take our own parts?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Ah, I wish old Brooke were back again. It was all right in his (<font color='blue'><b>Morgan</b></font>) time.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Why, yes, you see, then the strongest and best fellows were in the
sixth, and the fifth-form fellows were afraid of them, and they kept
good order; but now our sixth-form fellows are too small, and the fifth
don't care for them, and do what they like in the house.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``And so we get a double set of masters,''  (<font color='red'><b>Tom/Brown/Tom Brown</b></font>)</div>cried Tom indignantly--<div class="bookquote">``the
lawful ones, who are responsible to the Doctor at any rate, and the
unlawful, the tyrants, who are responsible to nobody.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Tom/Brown/Tom Brown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Down with the tyrants!''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>cried East; <div class="bookquote">``I'm all for law and order, and
hurrah for a revolution.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I shouldn't mind if it were only for young Brooke now,''  (<font color='red'><b>Tom/Brown/Tom Brown</b></font>)</div>said Tom; <div class="bookquote">``he (<font color='blue'><b>Doctor</b></font>)'s
such a good-hearted, gentlemanly fellow, and ought to be in the sixth.
I'd do anything for him (<font color='blue'><b>Doctor</b></font>). But that blackguard Flashman, who never speaks
to one without a kick or an oath--''

 (<font color='red'><b>Tom/Brown/Tom Brown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``The cowardly brute,''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>broke in East--<div class="bookquote">``how I hate him (<font color='blue'><b>Doctor</b></font>)! And he (<font color='blue'><b>Doctor</b></font>) knows it
too; he (<font color='blue'><b>Doctor</b></font>) knows that you and I think him (<font color='blue'><b>Doctor</b></font>) a coward. What a bore that he (<font color='blue'><b>Doctor</b></font>)'s
got a study in this passage! Don't you hear them now at supper in his (<font color='blue'><b>Doctor</b></font>)
den? Brandy-punch going, I'll bet. I wish the Doctor would come out and
catch him (<font color='blue'><b>Doctor</b></font>). We must change our study as soon as we can.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Change or no change, I'll never fag for him (<font color='blue'><b>Doctor</b></font>) again,''  (<font color='red'><b>Tom/Brown/Tom Brown</b></font>)</div>said Tom, thumping
the table.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Fa-a-a-ag!''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>sounded along the passage from Flashman's study. The
two boys looked at one another in silence. It had struck nine, so the
regular night-fags had left duty, and they were the nearest to the
supper-party. East sat up, and began to look comical, as he (<font color='blue'><b>Tom</b></font>) always did
under difficulties.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Fa-a-a-ag!''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>again. No answer.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Here, Brown! East! you cursed young skulks,''  (<font color='red'><b>Flashman</b></font>)</div>roared out Flashman,
coming to his (<font color='blue'><b>Tom</b></font>) open door; <div class="bookquote">``I know you're in; no shirking.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Flashman</b></font>)</div><p/>Tom stole to their door, and drew the bolts as noiselessly as he (<font color='blue'><b>Tom</b></font>) could;
East blew out the candle.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Barricade the first,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>whispered he (<font color='blue'><b>Tom</b></font>). <div class="bookquote">``Now, Tom, mind, no surrender.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Trust me for that,''  (<font color='red'><b>Tom/Brown/Tom Brown</b></font>)</div>said Tom between his (<font color='blue'><b>Tom</b></font>) teeth.

<p/>In another minute they heard the supper-party turn out and come down the
passage to their door. They held their breaths, and heard whispering, of
which they only made out Flashman's words, <div class="bookquote">``I know the young brutes are
in.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/>Then came summonses to open, which being unanswered, the assault
commenced. Luckily the door was a good strong oak one, and resisted the
united weight of Flashman's party. A pause followed, and they heard a
besieger remark, <div class="bookquote">``They're in safe enough. Don't you see how the door
holds at top and bottom? So the bolts must be drawn. We should have
forced the lock long ago.''  (<font color='red'><b>Tom/Brown/Tom Brown</b></font>)</div>East gave Tom a nudge, to call attention to
this scientific remark.

<p/>Then came attacks on particular panels, one of which at last gave way
to the repeated kicks; but it broke inwards, and the broken pieces got
jammed across -LRB-the door being lined with green baize-RRB-, and couldn't
easily be removed from outside: and the besieged, scorning further
concealment, strengthened their defences by pressing the end of their
sofa against the door. So, after one or two more ineffectual efforts,
Flashman and Company retired, vowing vengeance in no mild terms.

<p/>The first danger over, it only remained for the besieged to effect a
safe retreat, as it was now near bed-time. They listened intently, and
heard the supper-party resettle themselves, and then gently drew back
first one bolt and then the other. Presently the convivial noises began
again steadily. <div class="bookquote">``Now then, stand by for a run,''  (<font color='red'><b>Tom/Brown/Tom Brown</b></font>)</div>said East, throwing the
door wide open and rushing into the passage, closely followed by Tom.
They were too quick to be caught; but Flashman was on the lookout, and
sent an empty pickle-jar whizzing after them, which narrowly missed
Tom's head, and broke into twenty pieces at the end of the passage.
<div class="bookquote">``He (<font color='blue'><b>Tom</b></font>) wouldn't mind killing one, if he (<font color='blue'><b>Tom</b></font>) wasn't caught,''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>said East, as they
turned the corner.

<p/>There was no pursuit, so the two turned into the hall, where they found
a knot of small boys round the fire. Their story was told. The war of
independence had broken out. Who would join the revolutionary forces?
Several others present bound themselves not to fag for the fifth form
at once. One or two only edged off, and left the rebels. What else could
they do? <div class="bookquote">``I've a good mind to go to the Doctor straight,''  (<font color='red'><b>Tom/Brown/Tom Brown</b></font>)</div>said Tom.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``That'll never do. Don't you remember the levy of the school last half?''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>put in another.

<p/>In fact, the solemn assembly, a levy of the School, had been held, at
which the captain of the School had got up, and after premising that
several instances had occurred of matters having been reported to the
masters; that this was against public morality and School tradition;
that a levy of the sixth had been held on the subject, and they had
resolved that the practice must be stopped at once; and given out that
any boy, in whatever form, who should thenceforth appeal to a master,
without having first gone to some praepostor and laid the case before
him (<font color='blue'><b>master</b></font>), should be thrashed publicly, and sent to Coventry.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Well, then, let's try the sixth. Try Morgan,''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>suggested another. <div class="bookquote">``No
use'' (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>--<div class="bookquote">``Blabbing won't do,''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>was the general feeling.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``I'll give you fellows a piece of advice,''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>said a voice from the end
of the hall. They all turned round with a start, and the speaker got up
from a bench on which he (<font color='blue'><b>speaker</b></font>) had been lying unobserved, and gave himself a
shake. He (<font color='blue'><b>speaker</b></font>) was a big, loose-made fellow, with huge limbs which had grown
too far through his (<font color='blue'><b>speaker</b></font>) jacket and trousers. <div class="bookquote">``Don't you go to anybody at
all--you just stand out; say you won't fag. They'll soon get tired of
licking you. I've tried it on years ago with their forerunners.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``No! Did you? Tell us how it was?''  (<font color='red'><b>him</b></font>)</div>cried a chorus of voices, as they
clustered round him (<font color='blue'><b>speaker</b></font>).

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Well, just as it is with you. The fifth form would fag us, and I and
some more struck, and we beat `em. The good fellows left off directly,
and the bullies who kept on soon got afraid.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Was Flashman here then?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Yes; and a dirty, little, snivelling, sneaking fellow he (<font color='blue'><b>fellow</b></font>) was too. He (<font color='blue'><b>fellow</b></font>)
never dared join us, and used to toady the bullies by offering to fag
for them, and peaching against the rest of us.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Why wasn't he (<font color='blue'><b>fellow</b></font>) cut, then?''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>said East.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Oh, toadies never get cut; they're too useful. Besides, he (<font color='blue'><b>fellow</b></font>) has no end
of great hampers from home, with wine and game in them; so he (<font color='blue'><b>fellow</b></font>) toadied
and fed himself into favour.''

 (<font color='red'><b>the boys</b></font>)</div><p/>The quarter-to-ten bell now rang, and the small boys went off upstairs,
still consulting together, and praising their new counsellor, who
stretched himself out on the bench before the hall fire again. There
he (<font color='blue'><b>speaker</b></font>) lay, a very queer specimen of boyhood, by name Diggs, and familiarly
called <div class="bookquote">``the Mucker.''  (<font color='red'><b>Diggs</b></font>)</div>He (<font color='blue'><b>speaker</b></font>) was young for his (<font color='blue'><b>speaker</b></font>) size, and a very clever
fellow, nearly at the top of the fifth. His (<font color='blue'><b>speaker</b></font>) friends at home, having
regard, I suppose, to his (<font color='blue'><b>speaker</b></font>) age, and not to his (<font color='blue'><b>speaker</b></font>) size and place in the
school, hadn't put him (<font color='blue'><b>speaker</b></font>) into tails; and even his (<font color='blue'><b>speaker</b></font>) jackets were always too
small; and he (<font color='blue'><b>speaker</b></font>) had a talent for destroying clothes and making himself
look shabby. He (<font color='blue'><b>speaker</b></font>) wasn't on terms with Flashman's set, who sneered at his (<font color='blue'><b>speaker</b></font>)
dress and ways behind his (<font color='blue'><b>speaker</b></font>) back; which he (<font color='blue'><b>speaker</b></font>) knew, and revenged himself
by asking Flashman the most disagreeable questions, and treating him (<font color='blue'><b>speaker</b></font>)
familiarly whenever a crowd of boys were round him (<font color='blue'><b>speaker</b></font>). Neither was he (<font color='blue'><b>speaker</b></font>)
intimate with any of the other bigger boys, who were warned off by
his (<font color='blue'><b>speaker</b></font>) oddnesses, for he (<font color='blue'><b>speaker</b></font>) was a very queer fellow; besides, amongst other
failings, he (<font color='blue'><b>speaker</b></font>) had that of impecuniosity in a remarkable degree. He (<font color='blue'><b>speaker</b></font>)
brought as much money as other boys to school, but got rid of it in no
time, no one knew how; and then, being also reckless, borrowed from any
one; and when his (<font color='blue'><b>speaker</b></font>) debts accumulated and creditors pressed, would have
an auction in the hall of everything he (<font color='blue'><b>speaker</b></font>) possessed in the world, selling
even his (<font color='blue'><b>speaker</b></font>) school-books, candlestick, and study table. For weeks after
one of these auctions, having rendered his (<font color='blue'><b>speaker</b></font>) study uninhabitable, he (<font color='blue'><b>speaker</b></font>) would
live about in the fifth-form room and hall, doing his (<font color='blue'><b>speaker</b></font>) verses on old
letter-backs and odd scraps of paper, and learning his (<font color='blue'><b>speaker</b></font>) lessons no one
knew how. He (<font color='blue'><b>speaker</b></font>) never meddled with any little boy, and was popular with
them, though they all looked on him (<font color='blue'><b>speaker</b></font>) with a sort of compassion, and
called him (<font color='blue'><b>speaker</b></font>) <div class="bookquote">``Poor Diggs,''  (<font color='red'><b>him</b></font>)</div>not being able to resist appearances, or to
disregard wholly even the sneers of their enemy Flashman. However, he (<font color='blue'><b>speaker</b></font>)
seemed equally indifferent to the sneers of big boys and the pity of
small ones, and lived his (<font color='blue'><b>speaker</b></font>) own queer life with much apparent enjoyment to
himself. It is necessary to introduce Diggs thus particularly, as he (<font color='blue'><b>Diggs</b></font>) not
only did Tom and East good service in their present warfare, as is about
to be told, but soon afterwards, when he (<font color='blue'><b>Diggs</b></font>) got into the sixth, chose them
for his (<font color='blue'><b>Diggs</b></font>) fags, and excused them from study-fagging, thereby earning unto
himself eternal gratitude from them and all who are interested in their
history.

<p/>And seldom had small boys more need of a friend, for the morning after
the siege the storm burst upon the rebels in all its violence. Flashman
laid wait, and caught Tom before second lesson, and receiving a
point-blank <div class="bookquote">``No''  (<font color='red'><b>Tom/Brown/Tom Brown</b></font>)</div>when told to fetch his (<font color='blue'><b>Tom</b></font>) hat, seized him (<font color='blue'><b>Tom</b></font>) and twisted his (<font color='blue'><b>Tom</b></font>)
arm, and went through the other methods of torture in use. <div class="bookquote">``He (<font color='blue'><b>Diggs</b></font>) couldn't
make me cry, though,''  (<font color='red'><b>Tom/Brown/Tom Brown</b></font>)</div>as Tom said triumphantly to the rest of the
rebels; <div class="bookquote">``and I kicked his (<font color='blue'><b>Diggs</b></font>) shins well, I know.''  (<font color='red'><b>the rebels</b></font>)</div>And soon it crept
out that a lot of the fags were in league, and Flashman excited his (<font color='blue'><b>Tom</b></font>)
associates to join him (<font color='blue'><b>Tom</b></font>) in bringing the young vagabonds to their senses;
and the house was filled with constant chasings, and sieges, and
lickings of all sorts; and in return, the bullies' beds were pulled to
pieces and drenched with water, and their names written up on the walls
with every insulting epithet which the fag invention could furnish. The
war, in short, raged fiercely; but soon, as Diggs had told them, all
the better fellows in the fifth gave up trying to fag them, and public
feeling began to set against Flashman and his (<font color='blue'><b>Diggs</b></font>) two or three intimates,
and they were obliged to keep their doings more secret, but being
thorough bad fellows, missed no opportunity of torturing in private.
Flashman was an adept in all ways, but above all in the power of saying
cutting and cruel things, and could often bring tears to the eyes of
boys in this way, which all the thrashings in the world wouldn't have
wrung from them.

<p/>And as his (<font color='blue'><b>Diggs</b></font>) operations were being cut short in other directions, he (<font color='blue'><b>Diggs</b></font>) now
devoted himself chiefly to Tom and East, who lived at his (<font color='blue'><b>Tom</b></font>) own door, and
would force himself into their study whenever he (<font color='blue'><b>Tom</b></font>) found a chance, and sit
there, sometimes alone, and sometimes with a companion, interrupting all
their work, and exulting in the evident pain which every now and then he (<font color='blue'><b>companion</b></font>)
could see he (<font color='blue'><b>companion</b></font>) was inflicting on one or the other.

<p/>The storm had cleared the air for the rest of the house, and a better
state of things now began than there had been since old Brooke had left;
but an angry, dark spot of thunder-cloud still hung over the end of the
passage where Flashman's study and that of East and Tom lay.

<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Tom</b></font>) felt that they had been the first rebels, and that the rebellion had
been to a great extent successful; but what above all stirred the
hatred and bitterness of his (<font color='blue'><b>Tom</b></font>) heart against them was that in the frequent
collisions which there had been of late they had openly called him (<font color='blue'><b>Tom</b></font>)
coward and sneak. The taunts were too true to be forgiven. While he (<font color='blue'><b>Tom</b></font>)
was in the act of thrashing them, they would roar out instances of his (<font color='blue'><b>Tom</b></font>)
funking at football, or shirking some encounter with a lout of half his (<font color='blue'><b>Tom</b></font>)
own size. These things were all well enough known in the house, but
to have his (<font color='blue'><b>Tom</b></font>) own disgrace shouted out by small boys, to feel that they
despised him (<font color='blue'><b>Tom</b></font>), to be unable to silence them by any amount of torture, and
to see the open laugh and sneer of his (<font color='blue'><b>Tom</b></font>) own associates -LRB-who were looking
on, and took no trouble to hide their scorn from him (<font color='blue'><b>Tom</b></font>), though they
neither interfered with his (<font color='blue'><b>Tom</b></font>) bullying nor lived a bit the less intimately
with him (<font color='blue'><b>Tom</b></font>)-RRB-, made him (<font color='blue'><b>Tom</b></font>) beside himself. Come what might, he (<font color='blue'><b>Tom</b></font>) would make those
boys' lives miserable. So the strife settled down into a personal affair
between Flashman and our youngsters--a war to the knife, to be fought
out in the little cockpit at the end of the bottom passage.

<p/>Flashman, be it said, was about seventeen years old, and big and strong
of his (<font color='blue'><b>Tom</b></font>) age. He (<font color='blue'><b>Tom</b></font>) played well at all games where pluck wasn't much wanted,
and managed generally to keep up appearances where it was; and having
a bluff, off-hand manner, which passed for heartiness, and considerable
powers of being pleasant when he (<font color='blue'><b>Tom</b></font>) liked, went down with the school in
general for a good fellow enough. Even in the School-house, by dint of
his (<font color='blue'><b>fellow</b></font>) command of money, the constant supply of good things which he (<font color='blue'><b>fellow</b></font>) kept
up, and his (<font color='blue'><b>fellow</b></font>) adroit toadyism, he (<font color='blue'><b>fellow</b></font>) had managed to make himself not only
tolerated, but rather popular amongst his (<font color='blue'><b>fellow</b></font>) own contemporaries; although
young Brooke scarcely spoke to him (<font color='blue'><b>fellow</b></font>), and one or two others of the right
sort showed their opinions of him (<font color='blue'><b>fellow</b></font>) whenever a chance offered. But the
wrong sort happened to be in the ascendant just now, and so Flashman
was a formidable enemy for small boys. This soon became plain enough.
Flashman left no slander unspoken, and no deed undone, which could in
any way hurt his (<font color='blue'><b>fellow</b></font>) victims, or isolate them from the rest of the
house. One by one most of the other rebels fell away from them, while
Flashman's cause prospered, and several other fifth-form boys began to
look black at them and ill-treat them as they passed about the house. By
keeping out of bounds, or at all events out of the house and quadrangle,
all day, and carefully barring themselves in at night, East and Tom
managed to hold on without feeling very miserable; but it was as much as
they could do. Greatly were they drawn then towards old Diggs, who, in
an uncouth way, began to take a good deal of notice of them, and once
or twice came to their study when Flashman was there, who immediately
decamped in consequence. The boys thought that Diggs must have been
watching.

<p/>When therefore, about this time, an auction was one night announced to
take place in the hall, at which, amongst the superfluities of other
boys, all Diggs's penates for the time being were going to the hammer,
East and Tom laid their heads together, and resolved to devote their
ready cash -LRB-some four shillings sterling-RRB- to redeem such articles as
that sum would cover. Accordingly, they duly attended to bid, and
Tom became the owner of two lots of Diggs's things:--Lot 1, price
one-and-threepence, consisting -LRB-as the auctioneer remarked-RRB- of a
<div class="bookquote">``valuable assortment of old metals,''  (<font color='red'><b>the auctioneer</b></font>)</div>in the shape of a mouse-trap, a
cheese-toaster without a handle, and a saucepan: Lot 2, of a
villainous dirty table-cloth and green-baize curtain; while East, for
one-and-sixpence, purchased a leather paper-case, with a lock but no
key, once handsome, but now much the worse for wear. But they had still
the point to settle of how to get Diggs to take the things without
hurting his (<font color='blue'><b>Diggs</b></font>) feelings. This they solved by leaving them in his (<font color='blue'><b>Diggs</b></font>) study,
which was never locked when he (<font color='blue'><b>Diggs</b></font>) was out. Diggs, who had attended the
auction, remembered who had bought the lots, and came to their study
soon after, and sat silent for some time, cracking his (<font color='blue'><b>Diggs</b></font>) great red
finger-joints. Then he (<font color='blue'><b>Diggs</b></font>) laid hold of their verses, and began looking over
and altering them, and at last got up, and turning his (<font color='blue'><b>Diggs</b></font>) back to them,
said, <div class="bookquote">``You're uncommon good-hearted little beggars, you two. I value
that paper-case; my sister gave it to me last holidays. I won't
forget.''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>And so he (<font color='blue'><b>Diggs</b></font>) tumbled out into the passage, leaving them somewhat
embarrassed, but not sorry that he (<font color='blue'><b>Diggs</b></font>) knew what they had done.

<p/>The next morning was Saturday, the day on which the allowances of one
shilling a week were paid--an important event to spendthrift youngsters;
and great was the disgust amongst the small fry to hear that all the
allowances had been impounded for the Derby lottery. That great event
in the English year, the Derby, was celebrated at Rugby in those days
by many lotteries. It was not an improving custom, I own, gentle reader,
and led to making books, and betting, and other objectionable results;
but when our great Houses of Palaver think it right to stop the nation's
business on that day and many of the members bet heavily themselves, can
you blame us boys for following the example of our betters? At any rate
we did follow it. First there was the great school lottery, where the
first prize was six or seven pounds; then each house had one or more
separate lotteries. These were all nominally voluntary, no boy being
compelled to put in his (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>) shilling who didn't choose to do so. But besides
Flashman, there were three or four other fast, sporting young gentlemen
in the Schoolhouse, who considered subscription a matter of duty and
necessity; and so, to make their duty come easy to the small
boys, quietly secured the allowances in a lump when given out for
distribution, and kept them. It was no use grumbling--so many fewer
tartlets and apples were eaten and fives balls bought on that Saturday;
and after locking-up, when the money would otherwise have been spent,
consolation was carried to many a small boy by the sound of the
night-fags shouting along the passages, <div class="bookquote">``Gentlemen sportsmen of the
School-house; the lottery's going to be drawn in the hall.''  (<font color='red'><b>a boy</b></font>)</div>It was
pleasant to be called a gentleman sportsman, also to have a chance of
drawing a favourite horse.

<p/>The hall was full of boys, and at the head of one of the long tables
stood the sporting interest, with a hat before them, in which were the
tickets folded up. One of them then began calling out the list of the
house. Each boy as his (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>) name was called drew a ticket from the hat, and
opened it; and most of the bigger boys, after drawing, left the hall
directly to go back to their studies or the fifth-form room. The
sporting interest had all drawn blanks, and they were sulky accordingly;
neither of the favourites had yet been drawn, and it had come down to
the upper-fourth. So now, as each small boy came up and drew his (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>) ticket,
it was seized and opened by Flashman, or some other of the standers-by.
But no great favourite is drawn until it comes to the Tadpole's turn,
and he (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>) shuffles up and draws, and tries to make off, but is caught, and
his (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>) ticket is opened like the rest.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Here you are! Wanderer--the third favourite!''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>shouts the opener.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``I say, just give me my ticket, please,''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>remonstrates Tadpole.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Hullo! don't be in a hurry,''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>breaks in Flashman; <div class="bookquote">``what'll you sell
Wanderer for now?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I don't want to sell,''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>rejoins Tadpole.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Oh, don't you! Now listen, you young fool: you don't know anything
about it; the horse is no use to you. He (<font color='blue'><b>fool</b></font>) won't win, but I want him (<font color='blue'><b>fool</b></font>) as a
hedge. Now, I'll give you half a crown for him (<font color='blue'><b>fool</b></font>).''  (<font color='red'><b>Tadpole</b></font>)</div>Tadpole holds out, but
between threats and cajoleries at length sells half for one shilling and
sixpence--about a fifth of its fair market value; however, he (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>) is glad to
realize anything, and, as he (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>) wisely remarks, <div class="bookquote">``Wanderer mayn't win, and
the tizzy is safe anyhow.''

 (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div><p/>East presently comes up and draws a blank. Soon after comes Tom's turn.
His (<font color='blue'><b>Tom</b></font>) ticket, like the others, is seized and opened. <div class="bookquote">``Here you are then,''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>shouts the opener, holding it up--<div class="bookquote">``Harkaway!--By Jove, Flashey, your
young friend's in luck.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Give me the ticket,''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>says Flashman, with an oath, leaning across the
table with open hand and his (<font color='blue'><b>Tom</b></font>) face black with rage.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Wouldn't you like it?''  (<font color='red'><b>a fellow</b></font>)</div>replies the opener, not a bad fellow at the
bottom, and no admirer of Flashman. <div class="bookquote">``Here, Brown, catch hold.''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>And he (<font color='blue'><b>admirer</b></font>)
hands the ticket to Tom, who pockets it. Whereupon Flashman makes for
the door at once, that Tom and the ticket may not escape, and there
keeps watch until the drawing is over and all the boys are gone, except
the sporting set of five or six, who stay to compare books, make bets,
and so on; Tom, who doesn't choose to move while Flashman is at the
door; and East, who stays by his (<font color='blue'><b>Tom</b></font>) friend, anticipating trouble. The
sporting set now gathered round Tom. Public opinion wouldn't allow them
actually to rob him (<font color='blue'><b>Tom</b></font>) of his (<font color='blue'><b>Tom</b></font>) ticket, but any humbug or intimidation by
which he (<font color='blue'><b>Tom</b></font>) could be driven to sell the whole or part at an undervalue was
lawful.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Now, young Brown, come, what'll you sell me Harkaway for? I hear he (<font color='blue'><b>Brown</b></font>)
isn't going to start. I'll give you five shillings for him (<font color='blue'><b>Brown</b></font>),''  (<font color='red'><b>the boy</b></font>)</div>begins
the boy who had opened the ticket. Tom, remembering his (<font color='blue'><b>Tom</b></font>) good deed, and
moreover in his (<font color='blue'><b>Tom</b></font>) forlorn state wishing to make a friend, is about
to accept the offer, when another cries out, <div class="bookquote">``I'll give you seven
shillings.''  (<font color='red'><b>a friend</b></font>)</div>Tom hesitated and looked from one to the other.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``No, no!''  (<font color='red'><b>Flashman</b></font>)</div>said Flashman, pushing in, <div class="bookquote">``leave me to deal with him (<font color='blue'><b>Brown</b></font>); we'll
draw lots for it afterwards. Now sir, you know me: you'll sell Harkaway
to us for five shillings, or you'll repent it.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Flashman</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I won't sell a bit of him (<font color='blue'><b>Brown</b></font>),''  (<font color='red'><b>Tom/Brown/Tom Brown</b></font>)</div>answered Tom shortly.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``You hear that now!''  (<font color='red'><b>Flashman</b></font>)</div>said Flashman, turning to the others. <div class="bookquote">``He (<font color='blue'><b>Brown</b></font>)'s the
coxiest young blackguard in the house. I always told you so. We're
to have all the trouble and risk of getting up the lotteries for the
benefit of such fellows as he (<font color='blue'><b>Brown</b></font>).''

 (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div><p/>Flashman forgets to explain what risk they ran, but he (<font color='blue'><b>Tom</b></font>) speaks to willing
ears. Gambling makes boys selfish and cruel as well as men.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``That's true. We always draw blanks,''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>cried one.--<div class="bookquote">``Now, sir, you shall
sell half, at any rate.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I won't,''  (<font color='red'><b>Tom/Brown/Tom Brown</b></font>)</div>said Tom, flushing up to his (<font color='blue'><b>Tom</b></font>) hair, and lumping them all in
his (<font color='blue'><b>Tom</b></font>) mind with his (<font color='blue'><b>Tom</b></font>) sworn enemy.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Very well then; let's roast him (<font color='blue'><b>Brown</b></font>),''  (<font color='red'><b>Tom/Brown/Tom Brown</b></font>)</div>cried Flashman, and catches hold of
Tom by the collar. One or two boys hesitate, but the rest join in. East
seizes Tom's arm, and tries to pull him (<font color='blue'><b>Tom</b></font>) away, but is knocked back by
one of the boys, and Tom is dragged along struggling. His (<font color='blue'><b>Tom</b></font>) shoulders are
pushed against the mantelpiece, and he (<font color='blue'><b>Tom</b></font>) is held by main force before the
fire, Flashman drawing his (<font color='blue'><b>Tom</b></font>) trousers tight by way of extra torture. Poor
East, in more pain even than Tom, suddenly thinks of Diggs, and darts
off to find him (<font color='blue'><b>Tom</b></font>). <div class="bookquote">``Will you sell now for ten shillings?''  (<font color='red'><b>boy</b></font>)</div>says one boy who
is relenting.

<p/>Tom only answers by groans and struggles.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``I say, Flashey, he (<font color='blue'><b>Brown</b></font>) has had enough,''  (<font color='red'><b>the boy</b></font>)</div>says the same boy, dropping the arm
he (<font color='blue'><b>Tom</b></font>) holds.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``No, no; another turn'll do it,''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>answers Flashman. But poor Tom is done
already, turns deadly pale, and his (<font color='blue'><b>Tom</b></font>) head falls forward on his (<font color='blue'><b>Tom</b></font>) breast,
just as Diggs, in frantic excitement, rushes into the hall with East at
his (<font color='blue'><b>Diggs</b></font>) heels.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``You cowardly brutes!''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>is all he (<font color='blue'><b>Diggs</b></font>) can say, as he (<font color='blue'><b>Diggs</b></font>) catches Tom from them
and supports him (<font color='blue'><b>Tom</b></font>) to the hall table. <div class="bookquote">``Good God! he (<font color='blue'><b>God</b></font>)'s dying. Here, get
some cold water--run for the housekeeper.''

 (<font color='red'><b>others</b></font>)</div><p/>Flashman and one or two others slink away; the rest, ashamed and
sorry, bend over Tom or run for water, while East darts off for the
housekeeper. Water comes, and they throw it on his (<font color='blue'><b>Tom</b></font>) hands and face, and
he (<font color='blue'><b>Tom</b></font>) begins to come to. <div class="bookquote">``Mother!'' (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>--the words came feebly and slowly--<div class="bookquote">``it's
very cold to-night.''  (<font color='red'><b>Diggs</b></font>)</div>Poor old Diggs is blubbering like a child. <div class="bookquote">``Where
am I?''  (<font color='red'><b>Tom/Brown/Tom Brown</b></font>)</div>goes on Tom, opening his (<font color='blue'><b>Tom</b></font>) eyes, <div class="bookquote">``Ah! I remember now.''  (<font color='red'><b>Tom/Brown/Tom Brown</b></font>)</div>And he (<font color='blue'><b>Tom</b></font>) shut
his (<font color='blue'><b>Tom</b></font>) eyes again and groaned.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``I say,''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>is whispered, <div class="bookquote">``we can't do any good, and the housekeeper will
be here in a minute.''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>And all but one steal away. He (<font color='blue'><b>Tom</b></font>) stays with Diggs,
silent and sorrowful, and fans Tom's face.

<p/>The housekeeper comes in with strong salts, and Tom soon recovers enough
to sit up. There is a smell of burning. She (<font color='blue'><b>housekeeper</b></font>) examines his (<font color='blue'><b>Tom</b></font>) clothes, and
looks up inquiringly. The boys are silent.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``How did he (<font color='blue'><b>God</b></font>) come so?''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>No answer. <div class="bookquote">``There's been some bad work here,''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>housekeeper</b></font>)
adds, looking very serious, <div class="bookquote">``and I shall speak to the Doctor about it.''
 (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>Still no answer.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Hadn't we better carry him (<font color='blue'><b>Doctor</b></font>) to the sick-room?''  (<font color='red'><b>Diggs</b></font>)</div>suggests Diggs.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Oh, I can walk now,''  (<font color='red'><b>Tom/Brown/Tom Brown</b></font>)</div>says Tom; and, supported by East and the
housekeeper, goes to the sick-room. The boy who held his (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>) ground is soon
amongst the rest, who are all in fear of their lives. <div class="bookquote">``Did he (<font color='blue'><b>Doctor</b></font>) peach?''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``Does she (<font color='blue'><b>housekeeper</b></font>) know about it?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Not a word; he (<font color='blue'><b>Doctor</b></font>)'s a stanch little fellow.''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>And pausing a moment, he (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>)
adds, <div class="bookquote">``I'm sick of this work; what brutes we've been!''

 (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div><p/>Meantime Tom is stretched on the sofa in the housekeeper's room, with
East by his (<font color='blue'><b>Tom</b></font>) side, while she (<font color='blue'><b>housekeeper</b></font>) gets wine and water and other restoratives.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Are you much hurt, dear old boy?''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>whispers East.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Only the back of my legs,''  (<font color='red'><b>Tom/Brown/Tom Brown</b></font>)</div>answers Tom. They are indeed badly scorched,
and part of his (<font color='blue'><b>Tom</b></font>) trousers burnt through. But soon he (<font color='blue'><b>Tom</b></font>) is in bed with
cold bandages. At first he (<font color='blue'><b>Tom</b></font>) feels broken, and thinks of writing home and
getting taken away; and the verse of a hymn he (<font color='blue'><b>Tom</b></font>) had learned years ago
sings through his (<font color='blue'><b>Tom</b></font>) head, and he (<font color='blue'><b>Tom</b></font>) goes to sleep, murmuring,--


<p/><div class="bookquote">``Where the wicked cease from troubling, And the weary are at rest.''


 (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div><p/>But after a sound night's rest, the old boy-spirit comes back again.
East comes in, reporting that the whole house is with him (<font color='blue'><b>Tom</b></font>); and he (<font color='blue'><b>Tom</b></font>)
forgets everything, except their old resolve never to be beaten by that
bully Flashman.

<p/>Not a word could the housekeeper extract from either of them, and though
the Doctor knew all that she (<font color='blue'><b>housekeeper</b></font>) knew that morning, he (<font color='blue'><b>Doctor</b></font>) never knew any more.

<p/>I trust and believe that such scenes are not possible now at school,
and that lotteries and betting-books have gone out; but I am writing of
schools as they were in our time, and must give the evil with the good.



<p/>CHAPTER IX--A CHAPTER OF ACCIDENTS.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Wherein I -LSB-speak-RSB- of most disastrous chances,
Of moving accidents by flood and field,
Of hair-breadth `scapes.'' (<font color='red'><b>Shakespeare/SHAKESPEARE</b></font>)</div>--SHAKESPEARE.

<p/>When Tom came back into school after a couple of days in the sick-room,
he (<font color='blue'><b>Tom</b></font>) found matters much changed for the better, as East had led him (<font color='blue'><b>Tom</b></font>) to
expect. Flashman's brutality had disgusted most even of his (<font color='blue'><b>Tom</b></font>) intimate
friends, and his (<font color='blue'><b>Tom</b></font>) cowardice had once more been made plain to the house;
for Diggs had encountered him (<font color='blue'><b>Diggs</b></font>) on the morning after the lottery, and
after high words on both sides, had struck him (<font color='blue'><b>Diggs</b></font>), and the blow was not
returned. However, Flashey was not unused to this sort of thing, and had
lived through as awkward affairs before, and, as Diggs had said, fed and
toadied himself back into favour again. Two or three of the boys who had
helped to roast Tom came up and begged his (<font color='blue'><b>Tom</b></font>) pardon, and thanked him (<font color='blue'><b>Tom</b></font>) for
not telling anything. Morgan sent for him (<font color='blue'><b>Morgan</b></font>), and was inclined to take the
matter up warmly, but Tom begged him (<font color='blue'><b>Tom</b></font>) not to do it; to which he (<font color='blue'><b>Tom</b></font>) agreed,
on Tom's promising to come to him (<font color='blue'><b>Tom</b></font>) at once in future--a promise which, I
regret to say, he (<font color='blue'><b>Tom</b></font>) didn't keep. Tom kept Harkaway all to himself, and
won the second prize in the lottery, some thirty shillings, which he (<font color='blue'><b>Tom</b></font>) and
East contrived to spend in about three days in the purchase of pictures
for their study, two new bats and a cricket-ball--all the best that
could be got--and a supper of sausages, kidneys, and beef-steak pies
to all the rebels. Light come, light go; they wouldn't have been
comfortable with money in their pockets in the middle of the half.

<p/>The embers of Flashman's wrath, however, were still smouldering, and
burst out every now and then in sly blows and taunts, and they both
felt that they hadn't quite done with him (<font color='blue'><b>they</b></font>) yet. It wasn't long, however,
before the last act of that drama came, and with it the end of bullying
for Tom and East at Rugby. They now often stole out into the hall at
nights, incited thereto partly by the hope of finding Diggs there and
having a talk with him (<font color='blue'><b>Diggs</b></font>), partly by the excitement of doing something
which was against rules; for, sad to say, both of our youngsters, since
their loss of character for steadiness in their form, had got into
the habit of doing things which were forbidden, as a matter of
adventure,--just in the same way, I should fancy, as men fall into
smuggling, and for the same sort of reasons--thoughtlessness in the
first place. It never occurred to them to consider why such and such
rules were laid down: the reason was nothing to them, and they only
looked upon rules as a sort of challenge from the rule-makers, which it
would be rather bad pluck in them not to accept; and then again, in the
lower parts of the school they hadn't enough to do. The work of the form
they could manage to get through pretty easily, keeping a good enough
place to get their regular yearly remove; and not having much ambition
beyond this, their whole superfluous steam was available for games and
scrapes. Now, one rule of the house which it was a daily pleasure of all
such boys to break was that after supper all fags, except the three
on duty in the passages, should remain in their own studies until nine
o’clock; and if caught about the passages or hall, or in one another's
studies, they were liable to punishments or caning. The rule was
stricter than its observance; for most of the sixth spent their evenings
in the fifth-form room, where the library was, and the lessons were
learnt in common. Every now and then, however, a praepostor would be
seized with a fit of district visiting, and would make a tour of
the passages and hall and the fags' studies. Then, if the owner were
entertaining a friend or two, the first kick at the door and ominous
<div class="bookquote">``Open here''  (<font color='red'><b>a friend kick</b></font>)</div>had the effect of the shadow of a hawk over a chicken-yard:
every one cut to cover--one small boy diving under the sofa, another
under the table, while the owner would hastily pull down a book or
two and open them, and cry out in a meek voice, <div class="bookquote">``Hullo, who's there?''
 (<font color='red'><b>the owner</b></font>)</div>casting an anxious eye round to see that no protruding leg or elbow
could betray the hidden boys. <div class="bookquote">``Open, sir, directly; it's Snooks.''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``Oh, I'm very sorry; I didn't know it was you, Snooks.''  (<font color='red'><b>Snooks</b></font>)</div>And then with
well-feigned zeal the door would be opened, young hopeful praying that
that beast Snooks mightn't have heard the scuffle caused by his (<font color='blue'><b>Snooks</b></font>) coming.
If a study was empty, Snooks proceeded to draw the passages and hall to
find the truants.

<p/>Well, one evening, in forbidden hours, Tom and East were in the hall.
They occupied the seats before the fire nearest the door, while Diggs
sprawled as usual before the farther fire. He (<font color='blue'><b>Diggs</b></font>) was busy with a copy of
verses, and East and Tom were chatting together in whispers by the light
of the fire, and splicing a favourite old fives bat which had sprung.
Presently a step came down the bottom passage. They listened a moment,
assured themselves that it wasn't a praepostor, and then went on with
their work, and the door swung open, and in walked Flashman. He (<font color='blue'><b>Tom</b></font>) didn't
see Diggs, and thought it a good chance to keep his (<font color='blue'><b>Tom</b></font>) hand in; and as the
boys didn't move for him (<font color='blue'><b>Tom</b></font>), struck one of them, to make them get out of
his (<font color='blue'><b>Tom</b></font>) way.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``What's that for?''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>growled the assaulted one.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Because I choose. You've no business here. Go to your study.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``You can't send us.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Can't I? Then I'll thrash you if you stay,''  (<font color='red'><b>Flashman</b></font>)</div>said Flashman savagely.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``I say, you two,''  (<font color='red'><b>Diggs</b></font>)</div>said Diggs, from the end of the hall, rousing up and
resting himself on his (<font color='blue'><b>Diggs</b></font>) elbow--<div class="bookquote">``you'll never get rid of that fellow till
you lick him (<font color='blue'><b>Snooks</b></font>). Go in at him (<font color='blue'><b>Snooks</b></font>), both of you. I'll see fair play.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Diggs</b></font>)</div><p/>Flashman was taken aback, and retreated two steps. East looked at
Tom. <div class="bookquote">``Shall we try!''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>said he (<font color='blue'><b>Tom</b></font>). <div class="bookquote">``Yes,''  (<font color='red'><b>Tom/Brown/Tom Brown</b></font>)</div>said Tom desperately. So the two
advanced on Flashman, with clenched fists and beating hearts. They were
about up to his (<font color='blue'><b>Tom</b></font>) shoulder, but tough boys of their age, and in perfect
training; while he (<font color='blue'><b>Tom</b></font>), though strong and big, was in poor condition from
his (<font color='blue'><b>Tom</b></font>) monstrous habit of stuffing and want of exercise. Coward as he (<font color='blue'><b>Tom</b></font>) was,
however, Flashman couldn't swallow such an insult as this; besides, he (<font color='blue'><b>Tom</b></font>)
was confident of having easy work, and so faced the boys, saying, <div class="bookquote">``You
impudent young blackguards!''  (<font color='red'><b>the boys</b></font>)</div>Before he (<font color='blue'><b>Tom</b></font>) could finish his (<font color='blue'><b>Tom</b></font>) abuse, they
rushed in on him (<font color='blue'><b>Tom</b></font>), and began pummelling at all of him (<font color='blue'><b>Tom</b></font>) which they could
reach. He (<font color='blue'><b>Tom</b></font>) hit out wildly and savagely; but the full force of his (<font color='blue'><b>Tom</b></font>) blows
didn't tell--they were too near to him (<font color='blue'><b>Tom</b></font>). It was long odds, though, in
point of strength; and in another minute Tom went spinning backwards
over a form, and Flashman turned to demolish East with a savage grin.
But now Diggs jumped down from the table on which he (<font color='blue'><b>Diggs</b></font>) had seated himself.
<div class="bookquote">``Stop there,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>shouted he (<font color='blue'><b>Diggs</b></font>); <div class="bookquote">``the round's over--half-minute time allowed.''

 (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``What the -- is it to you?''  (<font color='red'><b>Flashman</b></font>)</div>faltered Flashman, who began to lose heart.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``I'm going to see fair, I tell you,''  (<font color='red'><b>Diggs</b></font>)</div>said Diggs, with a grin, and
snapping his (<font color='blue'><b>Diggs</b></font>) great red fingers; ```taint fair for you to be fighting one
of them at a time.--Are you ready, Brown? Time's up.''

<p/>The small boys rushed in again. Closing, they saw, was their best
chance, and Flashman was wilder and more flurried than ever: he (<font color='blue'><b>Brown</b></font>) caught
East by the throat, and tried to force him (<font color='blue'><b>Brown</b></font>) back on the iron-bound table.
Tom grasped his (<font color='blue'><b>Tom</b></font>) waist, and remembering the old throw he (<font color='blue'><b>Tom</b></font>) had learned
in the Vale from Harry Winburn, crooked his (<font color='blue'><b>Winburn</b></font>) leg inside Flashman's, and
threw his (<font color='blue'><b>Winburn</b></font>) whole weight forward. The three tottered for a moment, and
then over they went on to the floor, Flashman striking his (<font color='blue'><b>Winburn</b></font>) head against
a form in the hall.

<p/>The two youngsters sprang to their legs, but he (<font color='blue'><b>Winburn</b></font>) lay there still. They
began to be frightened. Tom stooped down, and then cried out, scared
out of his (<font color='blue'><b>Tom</b></font>) wits, <div class="bookquote">``He (<font color='blue'><b>Snooks</b></font>)'s bleeding awfully. Come here, East! Diggs, he (<font color='blue'><b>Diggs</b></font>)'s
dying!''

 (<font color='red'><b>Tom/Brown/Tom Brown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Not he (<font color='blue'><b>Diggs</b></font>),''  (<font color='red'><b>Diggs</b></font>)</div>said Diggs, getting leisurely off the table; <div class="bookquote">``it's all sham;
he (<font color='blue'><b>Diggs</b></font>)'s only afraid to fight it out.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Diggs</b></font>)</div><p/>East was as frightened as Tom. Diggs lifted Flashman's head, and he (<font color='blue'><b>Tom</b></font>)
groaned.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``What's the matter?''  (<font color='red'><b>Diggs</b></font>)</div>shouted Diggs.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``My skull's fractured,''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>sobbed Flashman.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Oh, let me run for the housekeeper!''  (<font color='red'><b>Tom/Brown/Tom Brown</b></font>)</div>cried Tom. <div class="bookquote">``What shall we do?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Fiddlesticks! It's nothing but the skin broken,''  (<font color='red'><b>Diggs</b></font>)</div>said the relentless
Diggs, feeling his (<font color='blue'><b>Diggs</b></font>) head. <div class="bookquote">``Cold water and a bit of rag's all he (<font color='blue'><b>Diggs</b></font>)'ll want.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Let me go,''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>said Flashman surlily, sitting up; <div class="bookquote">``I don't want your
help.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``We're really very sorry--''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>began East.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Hang your sorrow!''  (<font color='red'><b>Flashman</b></font>)</div>answered Flashman, holding his (<font color='blue'><b>Diggs</b></font>) handkerchief to the
place; <div class="bookquote">``you shall pay for this, I can tell you, both of you.''  (<font color='red'><b>Flashman</b></font>)</div>And he (<font color='blue'><b>Diggs</b></font>)
walked out of the hall.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``He (<font color='blue'><b>Diggs</b></font>) can't be very bad,''  (<font color='red'><b>Tom/Brown/Tom Brown</b></font>)</div>said Tom, with a deep sigh, much relieved to see
his (<font color='blue'><b>Tom</b></font>) enemy march so well.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Not he (<font color='blue'><b>Diggs</b></font>),''  (<font color='red'><b>Diggs</b></font>)</div>said Diggs; <div class="bookquote">``and you'll see you won't be troubled with him (<font color='blue'><b>Diggs</b></font>) any
more. But, I say, your head's broken too; your collar is covered with
blood.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Diggs</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Is it though?''  (<font color='red'><b>Tom/Brown/Tom Brown</b></font>)</div>said Tom, putting up his (<font color='blue'><b>Diggs</b></font>) hand; <div class="bookquote">``I didn't know it.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Tom/Brown/Tom Brown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Well, mop it up, or you'll have your jacket spoilt. And you have got a
nasty eye, Scud. You'd better go and bathe it well in cold water.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Cheap enough too, if we're done with our old friend Flashey,''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>said
East, as they made off upstairs to bathe their wounds.

<p/>They had done with Flashman in one sense, for he (<font color='blue'><b>Diggs</b></font>) never laid finger on
either of them again; but whatever harm a spiteful heart and venomous
tongue could do them, he (<font color='blue'><b>Diggs</b></font>) took care should be done. Only throw dirt
enough, and some of it is sure to stick; and so it was with the fifth
form and the bigger boys in general, with whom he (<font color='blue'><b>Diggs</b></font>) associated more or
less, and they not at all. Flashman managed to get Tom and East into
disfavour, which did not wear off for some time after the author of it
had disappeared from the School world. This event, much prayed for
by the small fry in general, took place a few months after the above
encounter. One fine summer evening Flashman had been regaling himself on
gin-punch, at Brownsover; and, having exceeded his (<font color='blue'><b>author</b></font>) usual limits, started
home uproarious. He (<font color='blue'><b>author</b></font>) fell in with a friend or two coming back from
bathing, proposed a glass of beer, to which they assented, the weather
being hot, and they thirsty souls, and unaware of the quantity of drink
which Flashman had already on board. The short result was, that Flashey
became beastly drunk. They tried to get him (<font color='blue'><b>author</b></font>) along, but couldn't; so they
chartered a hurdle and two men to carry him (<font color='blue'><b>author</b></font>). One of the masters came
upon them, and they naturally enough fled. The flight of the rest raised
the master's suspicions, and the good angel of the fags incited him (<font color='blue'><b>angel</b></font>)
to examine the freight, and, after examination, to convoy the hurdle
himself up to the School-house; and the Doctor, who had long had his (<font color='blue'><b>Doctor</b></font>) eye
on Flashman, arranged for his (<font color='blue'><b>Doctor</b></font>) withdrawal next morning.

<p/>The evil that men and boys too do lives after them: Flashman was gone,
but our boys, as hinted above, still felt the effects of his (<font color='blue'><b>Doctor</b></font>) hate.
Besides, they had been the movers of the strike against unlawful
fagging. The cause was righteous--the result had been triumphant to a
great extent; but the best of the fifth--even those who had never fagged
the small boys, or had given up the practice cheerfully--couldn't help
feeling a small grudge against the first rebels. After all, their form
had been defied, on just grounds, no doubt--so just, indeed, that they
had at once acknowledged the wrong, and remained passive in the strife.
Had they sided with Flashman and his (<font color='blue'><b>boys</b></font>) set, the rebels must have given way
at once. They couldn't help, on the whole, being glad that they had so
acted, and that the resistance had been successful against such of their
own form as had shown fight; they felt that law and order had gained
thereby, but the ringleaders they couldn't quite pardon at once.
<div class="bookquote">``Confoundedly coxy those young rascals will get, if we don't mind,''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>was
the general feeling.

<p/>So it is, and must be always, my dear boys. If the angel Gabriel were
to come down from heaven, and head a successful rise against the most
abominable and unrighteous vested interest which this poor old world
groans under, he (<font color='blue'><b>Gabriel</b></font>) would most certainly lose his (<font color='blue'><b>Gabriel</b></font>) character for many years,
probably for centuries, not only with the upholders of said vested
interest, but with the respectable mass of the people whom he (<font color='blue'><b>Gabriel</b></font>) had
delivered. They wouldn't ask him (<font color='blue'><b>Gabriel</b></font>) to dinner, or let their names appear
with his (<font color='blue'><b>Gabriel</b></font>) in the papers; they would be very careful how they spoke of
him (<font color='blue'><b>Gabriel</b></font>) in the Palaver, or at their clubs. What can we expect, then, when we
have only poor gallant blundering men like Kossuth, Garibaldi, Mazzini,
and righteous causes which do not triumph in their hands--men who
have holes enough in their armour, God knows, easy to be hit by
respectabilities sitting in their lounging chairs, and having large
balances at their bankers'? But you are brave, gallant boys, who hate
easy-chairs, and have no balances or bankers. You only want to have
your heads set straight, to take the right side; so bear in mind that
majorities, especially respectable ones, are nine times out of ten in
the wrong; and that if you see a man or boy striving earnestly on the
weak side, however wrong-headed or blundering he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) may be, you are not to
go and join the cry against him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>). If you can't join him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) and help him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>), and
make him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) wiser, at any rate remember that he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) has found something in the
world which he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) will fight and suffer for, which is just what you have
got to do for yourselves; and so think and speak of him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) tenderly.

<p/>So East and Tom, the Tadpole, and one or two more, became a sort of
young Ishmaelites, their hands against every one, and every one's hand
against them. It has been already told how they got to war with the
masters and the fifth form, and with the sixth it was much the same.
They saw the praepostors cowed by or joining with the fifth and shirking
their own duties; so they didn't respect them, and rendered no willing
obedience. It had been one thing to clean out studies for sons of heroes
like old Brooke, but was quite another to do the like for Snooks and
Green, who had never faced a good scrummage at football, and couldn't
keep the passages in order at night. So they only slurred through their
fagging just well enough to escape a licking, and not always that, and
got the character of sulky, unwilling fags. In the fifth-form room,
after supper, when such matters were often discussed and arranged, their
names were for ever coming up.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``I say, Green,''  (<font color='red'><b>Snooks</b></font>)</div>Snooks began one night, <div class="bookquote">``isn't that new boy, Harrison,
your fag?''

 (<font color='red'><b>Snooks</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Yes; why?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Oh, I know something of him (<font color='blue'><b>Harrison</b></font>) at home, and should like to excuse him (<font color='blue'><b>Harrison</b></font>).
Will you swop?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Who will you give me?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Well, let's see. There's Willis, Johnson. No, that won't do. Yes, I
have it. There's young East; I'll give you him (<font color='blue'><b>Willis</b></font>).''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Don't you wish you may get it?''  (<font color='red'><b>Green</b></font>)</div>replied Green. <div class="bookquote">``I'll give you two for
Willis, if you like.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Who, then?''  (<font color='red'><b>Snooks</b></font>)</div>asked Snooks. <div class="bookquote">``Hall and Brown.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Wouldn't have `em at a gift.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Better than East, though; for they ain't quite so sharp,''  (<font color='red'><b>Green</b></font>)</div>said Green,
getting up and leaning his (<font color='blue'><b>Green</b></font>) back against the mantelpiece. He (<font color='blue'><b>Green</b></font>) wasn't a bad
fellow, and couldn't help not being able to put down the unruly fifth
form. His (<font color='blue'><b>Green</b></font>) eye twinkled as he (<font color='blue'><b>Green</b></font>) went on, <div class="bookquote">``Did I ever tell you how the young
vagabond sold me last half?''

 (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``No; how?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Well, he (<font color='blue'><b>Brown</b></font>) never half cleaned my study out--only just stuck the
candlesticks in the cupboard, and swept the crumbs on to the floor. So
at last I was mortal angry, and had him (<font color='blue'><b>Brown</b></font>) up, and made him (<font color='blue'><b>Brown</b></font>) go through the
whole performance under my eyes. The dust the young scamp made nearly
choked me, and showed that he (<font color='blue'><b>Brown</b></font>) hadn't swept the carpet before. Well, when
it was all finished, `Now, young gentleman,' says I, `mind, I expect
this to be done every morning--floor swept, table-cloth taken off and
shaken, and everything dusted.' `Very well,' grunts he (<font color='blue'><b>gentleman</b></font>). Not a bit of
it though. I was quite sure, in a day or two, that he (<font color='blue'><b>gentleman</b></font>) never took the
table-cloth off even. So I laid a trap for him (<font color='blue'><b>gentleman</b></font>). I tore up some paper,
and put half a dozen bits on my table one night, and the cloth over them
as usual. Next morning after breakfast up I came, pulled off the cloth,
and, sure enough, there was the paper, which fluttered down on to the
floor. I was in a towering rage. `I've got you now,' thought I, and sent
for him (<font color='blue'><b>gentleman</b></font>), while I got out my cane. Up he (<font color='blue'><b>gentleman</b></font>) came as cool as you please, with
his (<font color='blue'><b>gentleman</b></font>) hands in his (<font color='blue'><b>gentleman</b></font>) pockets. `Didn't I tell you to shake my table-cloth
every morning?' roared I. `Yes,' says he (<font color='blue'><b>gentleman</b></font>). `Did you do it this morning?'
`Yes.' `You young liar! I put these pieces of paper on the table last
night, and if you'd taken the table-cloth off you'd have seen them, so
I'm going to give you a good licking.' Then my youngster takes one hand
out of his (<font color='blue'><b>youngster</b></font>) pocket, and just stoops down and picks up two of the bits
of paper, and holds them out to me. There was written on each, in great
round text, `Harry East, his (<font color='blue'><b>East</b></font>) mark.' The young rogue had found my
trap out, taken away my paper, and put some of his (<font color='blue'><b>East</b></font>) there, every bit
ear-marked. I'd a great mind to lick him (<font color='blue'><b>East</b></font>) for his (<font color='blue'><b>East</b></font>) impudence; but, after
all, one has no right to be laying traps, so I didn't. Of course I was
at his (<font color='blue'><b>East</b></font>) mercy till the end of the half, and in his (<font color='blue'><b>East</b></font>) weeks my study was so
frowzy I couldn't sit in it.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``They spoil one's things so, too,''  (<font color='red'><b>a boy</b></font>)</div>chimed in a third boy. <div class="bookquote">``Hall and
Brown were night-fags last week. I called `fag,' and gave them my
candlesticks to clean. Away they went, and didn't appear again. When
they'd had time enough to clean them three times over, I went out to
look after them. They weren't in the passages so down I went into the
hall, where I heard music; and there I found them sitting on the table,
listening to Johnson, who was playing the flute, and my candlesticks
stuck between the bars well into the fire, red-hot, clean spoiled.
They've never stood straight since, and I must get some more. However, I
gave them a good licking; that's one comfort.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/>Such were the sort of scrapes they were always getting into; and so,
partly by their own faults, partly from circumstances, partly from the
faults of others, they found themselves outlaws, ticket-of-leave men, or
what you will in that line--in short, dangerous parties--and lived the
sort of hand-to-mouth, wild, reckless life which such parties generally
have to put up with. Nevertheless they never quite lost favour with
young Brooke, who was now the cock of the house, and just getting into
the sixth; and Diggs stuck to them like a man, and gave them store of
good advice, by which they never in the least profited.

<p/>And even after the house mended, and law and order had been restored,
which soon happened after young Brooke and Diggs got into the sixth,
they couldn't easily or at once return into the paths of steadiness, and
many of the old, wild, out-of-bounds habits stuck to them as firmly as
ever. While they had been quite little boys, the scrapes they got into
in the School hadn't much mattered to any one; but now they were in the
upper school, all wrong-doers from which were sent up straight to the
Doctor at once. So they began to come under his (<font color='blue'><b>Doctor</b></font>) notice; and as they were
a sort of leaders in a small way amongst their own contemporaries, his (<font color='blue'><b>Doctor</b></font>)
eye, which was everywhere, was upon them.

<p/>It was a toss-up whether they turned out well or ill, and so they were
just the boys who caused most anxiety to such a master. You have been
told of the first occasion on which they were sent up to the Doctor, and
the remembrance of it was so pleasant that they had much less fear of
him (<font color='blue'><b>Doctor</b></font>) than most boys of their standing had. <div class="bookquote">``It's all his (<font color='blue'><b>Johnson</b></font>) look,''  (<font color='red'><b>Tom/Brown/Tom Brown</b></font>)</div>Tom used
to say to East, <div class="bookquote">``that frightens fellows. Don't you remember, he (<font color='blue'><b>Johnson</b></font>) never
said anything to us my first half-year for being an hour late for
locking-up?''

 (<font color='red'><b>Tom/Brown/Tom Brown</b></font>)</div><p/>The next time that Tom came before him (<font color='blue'><b>Tom</b></font>), however, the interview was of
a very different kind. It happened just about the time at which we have
now arrived, and was the first of a series of scrapes into which our
hero managed now to tumble.

<p/>The river Avon at Rugby is a slow and not very clear stream, in which
chub, dace, roach, and other coarse fish are -LRB-or were-RRB- plentiful
enough, together with a fair sprinkling of small jack, but no fish worth
sixpence either for sport or food. It is, however, a capital river for
bathing, as it has many nice small pools and several good reaches for
swimming, all within about a mile of one another, and at an easy twenty
minutes' walk from the school. This mile of water is rented, or used to
be rented, for bathing purposes by the trustees of the School, for the
boys. The footpath to Brownsover crosses the river by <div class="bookquote">``the Planks,''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>a
curious old single-plank bridge running for fifty or sixty yards into
the flat meadows on each side of the river--for in the winter there
are frequent floods. Above the Planks were the bathing-places for the
smaller boys--Sleath's, the first bathing-place, where all new boys
had to begin, until they had proved to the bathing men -LRB-three steady
individuals, who were paid to attend daily through the summer to prevent
accidents-RRB- that they could swim pretty decently, when they were allowed
to go on to Anstey's, about one hundred and fifty yards below. Here
there was a hole about six feet deep and twelve feet across, over which
the puffing urchins struggled to the opposite side, and thought no small
beer of themselves for having been out of their depths. Below the Planks
came larger and deeper holes, the first of which was Wratislaw's, and
the last Swift's, a famous hole, ten or twelve feet deep in parts, and
thirty yards across, from which there was a fine swimming reach right
down to the mill. Swift's was reserved for the sixth and fifth forms,
and had a spring board and two sets of steps: the others had one set of
steps each, and were used indifferently by all the lower boys, though
each house addicted itself more to one hole than to another. The
School-house at this time affected Wratislaw's hole, and Tom and East,
who had learnt to swim like fishes, were to be found there as regular as
the clock through the summer, always twice, and often three times a day.

<p/>Now the boys either had, or fancied they had, a right also to fish at
their pleasure over the whole of this part of the river, and would not
understand that the right -LRB-if any-RRB- only extended to the Rugby side. As
ill-luck would have it, the gentleman who owned the opposite bank, after
allowing it for some time without interference, had ordered his (<font color='blue'><b>gentleman</b></font>) keepers
not to let the boys fish on his (<font color='blue'><b>gentleman</b></font>) side--the consequence of which had been
that there had been first wranglings and then fights between the keepers
and boys; and so keen had the quarrel become that the landlord and his (<font color='blue'><b>gentleman</b></font>)
keepers, after a ducking had been inflicted on one of the latter, and
a fierce fight ensued thereon, had been up to the great school at
calling-over to identify the delinquents, and it was all the Doctor
himself and five or six masters could do to keep the peace. Not even his (<font color='blue'><b>Doctor</b></font>)
authority could prevent the hissing; and so strong was the feeling that
the four praepostors of the week walked up the school with their canes,
shouting <div class="bookquote">``S-s-s-s-i-lenc-c-c-c-e''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>at the top of their voices. However,
the chief offenders for the time were flogged and kept in bounds; but
the victorious party had brought a nice hornet's nest about their ears.
The landlord was hissed at the School-gates as he (<font color='blue'><b>chief</b></font>) rode past, and when he (<font color='blue'><b>chief</b></font>)
charged his (<font color='blue'><b>chief</b></font>) horse at the mob of boys, and tried to thrash them with
his (<font color='blue'><b>chief</b></font>) whip, was driven back by cricket-bats and wickets, and pursued with
pebbles and fives balls; while the wretched keepers' lives were a burden
to them, from having to watch the waters so closely.

<p/>The School-house boys of Tom's standing, one and all, as a protest
against this tyranny and cutting short of their lawful amusements, took
to fishing in all ways, and especially by means of night-lines. The
little tacklemaker at the bottom of the town would soon have made his (<font color='blue'><b>Tom</b></font>)
fortune had the rage lasted, and several of the barbers began to lay in
fishing-tackle. The boys had this great advantage over their enemies,
that they spent a large portion of the day in nature's garb by the
river-side, and so, when tired of swimming, would get out on the other
side and fish, or set night-lines, till the keepers hove in sight, and
then plunge in and swim back and mix with the other bathers, and the
keepers were too wise to follow across the stream.

<p/>While things were in this state, one day Tom and three or four others
were bathing at Wratislaw's, and had, as a matter of course, been taking
up and re-setting night-lines. They had all left the water, and were
sitting or standing about at their toilets, in all costumes, from
a shirt upwards, when they were aware of a man in a velveteen
shooting-coat approaching from the other side. He (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) was a new keeper, so
they didn't recognize or notice him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>), till he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) pulled up right opposite,
and began:

<p/><div class="bookquote">``I see'd some of you young gentlemen over this side a-fishing just now.''

 (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Hullo! who are you? What business is that of yours, old Velveteens?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I'm the new under-keeper, and master's told me to keep a sharp lookout
on all o' you young chaps. And I tells `ee I means business, and you'd
better keep on your own side, or we shall fall out.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Well, that's right, Velveteens; speak out, and let's know your mind at
once.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Look here, old boy,''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>cried East, holding up a miserable, coarse fish
or two and a small jack; <div class="bookquote">``would you like to smell `em and see which bank
they lived under?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I'll give you a bit of advice, keeper,''  (<font color='red'><b>Tom/Brown/Tom Brown</b></font>)</div>shouted Tom, who was sitting
in his (<font color='blue'><b>Tom</b></font>) shirt paddling with his (<font color='blue'><b>Tom</b></font>) feet in the river: <div class="bookquote">``you'd better go down
there to Swift's, where the big boys are; they're beggars at setting
lines, and'll put you up to a wrinkle or two for catching the
five-pounders.''  (<font color='red'><b>Tom/Brown/Tom Brown</b></font>)</div>Tom was nearest to the keeper, and that officer, who was
getting angry at the chaff, fixed his (<font color='blue'><b>Tom</b></font>) eyes on our hero, as if to take a
note of him (<font color='blue'><b>Tom</b></font>) for future use. Tom returned his (<font color='blue'><b>Tom</b></font>) gaze with a steady stare,
and then broke into a laugh, and struck into the middle of a favourite
School-house song,--

<p/><div class="bookquote">``As I and my companions
Were setting of a snare
The gamekeeper was watching us;
For him (<font color='blue'><b>Swift</b></font>) we did not care:
For we can wrestle and fight, my boys,
And jump out anywhere.
For it's my delight of a likely night,
In the season of the year.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Tom/Brown/Tom Brown</b></font>)</div><p/>The chorus was taken up by the other boys with shouts of laughter, and
the keeper turned away with a grunt, but evidently bent on mischief. The
boys thought no more of the matter.

<p/>But now came on the May-fly season; the soft, hazy summer weather lay
sleepily along the rich meadows by Avon side, and the green and gray
flies flickered with their graceful, lazy up-and-down flight over
the reeds and the water and the meadows, in myriads upon myriads.
The May-flies must surely be the lotus-eaters of the ephemerae--the
happiest, laziest, carelessest fly that dances and dreams out his (<font color='blue'><b>keeper</b></font>) few
hours of sunshiny life by English rivers.

<p/>Every little pitiful, coarse fish in the Avon was on the alert for
the flies, and gorging his (<font color='blue'><b>keeper</b></font>) wretched carcass with hundreds daily, the
gluttonous rogues! and every lover of the gentle craft was out to avenge
the poor May-flies.

<p/>So one fine Thursday afternoon, Tom, having borrowed East's new rod,
started by himself to the river. He (<font color='blue'><b>Tom</b></font>) fished for some time with small
success--not a fish would rise at him (<font color='blue'><b>Tom</b></font>); but as he (<font color='blue'><b>Tom</b></font>) prowled along the bank,
he (<font color='blue'><b>Tom</b></font>) was presently aware of mighty ones feeding in a pool on the opposite
side, under the shade of a huge willow-tree. The stream was deep
here, but some fifty yards below was a shallow, for which he (<font color='blue'><b>Tom</b></font>) made off
hot-foot; and forgetting landlords, keepers, solemn prohibitions of the
Doctor, and everything else, pulled up his (<font color='blue'><b>Doctor</b></font>) trousers, plunged across, and
in three minutes was creeping along on all fours towards the clump of
willows.

<p/>It isn't often that great chub, or any other coarse fish, are in earnest
about anything; but just then they were thoroughly bent on feeding, and
in half an hour Master Tom had deposited three thumping fellows at the
foot of the giant willow. As he (<font color='blue'><b>Tom</b></font>) was baiting for a fourth pounder, and
just going to throw in again, he (<font color='blue'><b>Tom</b></font>) became aware of a man coming up the
bank not one hundred yards off. Another look told him (<font color='blue'><b>Tom</b></font>) that it was the
under-keeper. Could he (<font color='blue'><b>Tom</b></font>) reach the shallow before him (<font color='blue'><b>Tom</b></font>)? No, not carrying
his (<font color='blue'><b>Tom</b></font>) rod. Nothing for it but the tree. So Tom laid his (<font color='blue'><b>Tom</b></font>) bones to it,
shinning up as fast as he (<font color='blue'><b>Tom</b></font>) could, and dragging up his (<font color='blue'><b>Tom</b></font>) rod after him (<font color='blue'><b>Tom</b></font>). He (<font color='blue'><b>Tom</b></font>)
had just time to reach and crouch along upon a huge branch some ten feet
up, which stretched out over the river, when the keeper arrived at the
clump. Tom's heart beat fast as he (<font color='blue'><b>Tom</b></font>) came under the tree; two steps more
and he (<font color='blue'><b>Tom</b></font>) would have passed, when, as ill-luck would have it, the gleam on
the scales of the dead fish caught his (<font color='blue'><b>Tom</b></font>) eye, and he (<font color='blue'><b>Tom</b></font>) made a dead point
at the foot of the tree. He (<font color='blue'><b>Tom</b></font>) picked up the fish one by one; his (<font color='blue'><b>Tom</b></font>) eye and
touch told him (<font color='blue'><b>Tom</b></font>) that they had been alive and feeding within the hour. Tom
crouched lower along the branch, and heard the keeper beating the clump.
<div class="bookquote">``If I could only get the rod hidden,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>thought he (<font color='blue'><b>Tom</b></font>), and began gently
shifting it to get it alongside of him (<font color='blue'><b>Tom</b></font>); <div class="bookquote">``willowtrees don't throw out
straight hickory shoots twelve feet long, with no leaves, worse luck.''
 (<font color='red'><b>him</b></font>)</div>Alas! the keeper catches the rustle, and then a sight of the rod, and
then of Tom's hand and arm.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Oh, be up ther', be `ee?''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>says he (<font color='blue'><b>Tom</b></font>), running under the tree. <div class="bookquote">``Now you
come down this minute.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Tree'd at last,''  (<font color='red'><b>Tom/Brown/Tom Brown</b></font>)</div>thinks Tom, making no answer, and keeping as close as
possible, but working away at the rod, which he (<font color='blue'><b>Tom</b></font>) takes to pieces. <div class="bookquote">``I'm
in for it, unless I can starve him (<font color='blue'><b>you</b></font>) out.''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>And then he (<font color='blue'><b>Tom</b></font>) begins to meditate
getting along the branch for a plunge, and scramble to the other side;
but the small branches are so thick, and the opposite bank so difficult,
that the keeper will have lots of time to get round by the ford before
he (<font color='blue'><b>keeper</b></font>) can get out, so he (<font color='blue'><b>keeper</b></font>) gives that up. And now he (<font color='blue'><b>keeper</b></font>) hears the keeper
beginning to scramble up the trunk. That will never do; so he (<font color='blue'><b>keeper</b></font>) scrambles
himself back to where his (<font color='blue'><b>keeper</b></font>) branch joins the trunk; and stands with lifted
rod.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Hullo, Velveteens; mind your fingers if you come any higher.''

 (<font color='red'><b>The keeper</b></font>)</div><p/>The keeper stops and looks up, and then with a grin says, <div class="bookquote">``Oh! be you,
be it, young measter? Well, here's luck. Now I tells `ee to come down at
once, and `t'll be best for `ee.''

 (<font color='red'><b>The keeper</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Thank `ee, Velveteens; I'm very comfortable,''  (<font color='red'><b>Tom/Brown/Tom Brown</b></font>)</div>said Tom, shortening the
rod in his (<font color='blue'><b>Tom</b></font>) hand, and preparing for battle.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Werry well; please yourself,''  (<font color='red'><b>the keeper</b></font>)</div>says the keeper, descending, however,
to the ground again, and taking his (<font color='blue'><b>keeper</b></font>) seat on the bank. <div class="bookquote">``I bean't in no
hurry, so you may take your time. I'll l’arn `ee to gee honest folk
names afore I've done with `ee.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``My luck as usual,''  (<font color='red'><b>Tom/Brown/Tom Brown</b></font>)</div>thinks Tom; <div class="bookquote">``what a fool I was to give him (<font color='blue'><b>fool</b></font>) a black!
If I'd called him (<font color='blue'><b>fool</b></font>) `keeper,' now, I might get off. The return match is
all his (<font color='blue'><b>keeper</b></font>) way.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Tom/Brown/Tom Brown</b></font>)</div><p/>The keeper quietly proceeded to take out his (<font color='blue'><b>keeper</b></font>) pipe, fill, and light it,
keeping an eye on Tom, who now sat disconsolately across the branch,
looking at keeper--a pitiful sight for men and fishes. The more he (<font color='blue'><b>keeper</b></font>)
thought of it the less he (<font color='blue'><b>keeper</b></font>) liked it. <div class="bookquote">``It must be getting near second
calling-over,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>thinks he (<font color='blue'><b>keeper</b></font>). Keeper smokes on stolidly. <div class="bookquote">``If he (<font color='blue'><b>keeper</b></font>) takes me up,
I shall be flogged safe enough. I can't sit here all night. Wonder if
he (<font color='blue'><b>keeper</b></font>)'ll rise at silver.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I say, keeper,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>said he (<font color='blue'><b>Keeper</b></font>) meekly, <div class="bookquote">``let me go for two bob?''

 (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Not for twenty neither,''  (<font color='red'><b>persecutor</b></font>)</div>grunts his (<font color='blue'><b>Keeper</b></font>) persecutor.

<p/>And so they sat on till long past second calling-over, and the sun came
slanting in through the willow-branches, and telling of locking-up near
at hand.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``I'm coming down, keeper,''  (<font color='red'><b>Tom/Brown/Tom Brown</b></font>)</div>said Tom at last, with a sigh, fairly tired
out. <div class="bookquote">``Now what are you going to do?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Walk `ee up to School, and give `ee over to the Doctor; them's my
orders,''  (<font color='red'><b>Velveteens</b></font>)</div>says Velveteens, knocking the ashes out of his (<font color='blue'><b>Tom</b></font>) fourth pipe, and
standing up and shaking himself.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Very good,''  (<font color='red'><b>Tom/Brown/Tom Brown</b></font>)</div>said Tom; <div class="bookquote">``but hands off, you know. I'll go with you
quietly, so no collaring or that sort of thing.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Tom/Brown/Tom Brown</b></font>)</div><p/>Keeper looked at him (<font color='blue'><b>Keeper</b></font>) a minute. <div class="bookquote">``Werry good,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>said he (<font color='blue'><b>Keeper</b></font>) at last. And so Tom
descended, and wended his (<font color='blue'><b>Tom</b></font>) way drearily by the side of the keeper, up to
the Schoolhouse, where they arrived just at locking-up. As they passed
the School-gates, the Tadpole and several others who were standing there
caught the state of things, and rushed out, crying, <div class="bookquote">``Rescue!''  (<font color='red'><b>others</b></font>)</div>But Tom
shook his (<font color='blue'><b>Tom</b></font>) head; so they only followed to the Doctor's gate, and went
back sorely puzzled.

<p/>How changed and stern the Doctor seemed from the last time that Tom was
up there, as the keeper told the story, not omitting to state how Tom
had called him (<font color='blue'><b>Tom</b></font>) blackguard names. <div class="bookquote">``Indeed, sir,''  (<font color='red'><b>the culprit</b></font>)</div>broke in the culprit,
<div class="bookquote">``it was only Velveteens.''  (<font color='red'><b>the culprit</b></font>)</div>The Doctor only asked one question.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``You know the rule about the banks, Brown?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Yes, sir.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Then wait for me to-morrow, after first lesson.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I thought so,''  (<font color='red'><b>Tom/Brown/Tom Brown</b></font>)</div>muttered Tom.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``And about the rod, sir?''  (<font color='red'><b>the keeper</b></font>)</div>went on the keeper. <div class="bookquote">``Master's told we as we
might have all the rods--''

 (<font color='red'><b>Tom/Brown/Tom Brown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Oh, please, sir,''  (<font color='red'><b>Tom/Brown/Tom Brown</b></font>)</div>broke in Tom, <div class="bookquote">``the rod isn't mine.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Tom/Brown/Tom Brown</b></font>)</div><p/>The Doctor looked puzzled; but the keeper, who was a good-hearted
fellow, and melted at Tom's evident distress, gave up his (<font color='blue'><b>Tom</b></font>) claim. Tom
was flogged next morning, and a few days afterwards met Velveteens, and
presented him (<font color='blue'><b>Tom</b></font>) with half a crown for giving up the rod claim, and they
became sworn friends; and I regret to say that Tom had many more fish
from under the willow that May-fly season, and was never caught again by
Velveteens.

<p/>It wasn't three weeks before Tom, and now East by his (<font color='blue'><b>Tom</b></font>) side, were
again in the awful presence. This time, however, the Doctor was not so
terrible. A few days before, they had been fagged at fives to fetch the
balls that went off the court. While standing watching the game, they
saw five or six nearly new balls hit on the top of the School. <div class="bookquote">``I say,
Tom,''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>said East, when they were dismissed, <div class="bookquote">``couldn't we get those balls
somehow?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Let's try, anyhow.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/>So they reconnoitred the walls carefully, borrowed a coal-hammer from
old Stumps, bought some big nails, and after one or two attempts, scaled
the Schools, and possessed themselves of huge quantities of fives balls.
The place pleased them so much that they spent all their spare time
there, scratching and cutting their names on the top of every tower; and
at last, having exhausted all other places, finished up with inscribing
H.EAST, T.BROWN, on the minute-hand of the great clock; in the doing of
which they held the minute-hand, and disturbed the clock's economy. So
next morning, when masters and boys came trooping down to prayers, and
entered the quadrangle, the injured minute-hand was indicating three
minutes to the hour. They all pulled up, and took their time. When the
hour struck, doors were closed, and half the school late. Thomas being
set to make inquiry, discovers their names on the minute-hand, and
reports accordingly; and they are sent for, a knot of their friends
making derisive and pantomimic allusions to what their fate will be as
they walk off.

<p/>But the Doctor, after hearing their story, doesn't make much of it, and
only gives them thirty lines of Homer to learn by heart, and a lecture
on the likelihood of such exploits ending in broken bones.

<p/>Alas! almost the next day was one of the great fairs in the town; and as
several rows and other disagreeable accidents had of late taken place
on these occasions, the Doctor gives out, after prayers in the morning,
that no boy is to go down into the town. Wherefore East and Tom, for
no earthly pleasure except that of doing what they are told not to do,
start away, after second lesson, and making a short circuit through the
fields, strike a back lane which leads into the town, go down it, and
run plump upon one of the masters as they emerge into the High Street.
The master in question, though a very clever, is not a righteous man.
He (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) has already caught several of his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) own pupils, and gives them lines
to learn, while he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) sends East and Tom, who are not his (<font color='blue'><b>Tom</b></font>) pupils, up to the
Doctor, who, on learning that they had been at prayers in the morning,
flogs them soundly.

<p/>The flogging did them no good at the time, for the injustice of their
captor was rankling in their minds; but it was just the end of the half,
and on the next evening but one Thomas knocks at their door, and says
the Doctor wants to see them. They look at one another in silent dismay.
What can it be now? Which of their countless wrong-doings can he (<font color='blue'><b>Doctor</b></font>) have
heard of officially? However, it's no use delaying, so up they go to the
study. There they find the Doctor, not angry, but very graver. <div class="bookquote">``He (<font color='blue'><b>Tom</b></font>) has
sent for them to speak to very seriously before they go home. They have
each been flogged several times in the half-year for direct and
wilful breaches of rules. This cannot go on. They are doing no good to
themselves or others, and now they are getting up in the School, and
have influence. They seem to think that rules are made capriciously, and
for the pleasure of the masters; but this is not so. They are made for
the good of the whole School, and must and shall be obeyed. Those who
thoughtlessly or wilfully break them will not be allowed to stay at the
School. He (<font color='blue'><b>them</b></font>) should be sorry if they had to leave, as the School might
do them both much good, and wishes them to think very seriously in the
holidays over what he (<font color='blue'><b>them</b></font>) has said. Good-night.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/>And so the two hurry off horribly scared; the idea of having to leave
has never crossed their minds, and is quite unbearable.

<p/>As they go out, they meet at the door old Holmes, a sturdy, cheery
praepostor of another house, who goes in to the Doctor; and they hear
his (<font color='blue'><b>Doctor</b></font>) genial, hearty greeting of the newcomer, so different to their own
reception, as the door closes, and return to their study with heavy
hearts, and tremendous resolves to break no more rules.

<p/>Five minutes afterwards the master of their form--a late arrival and a
model young master--knocks at the Doctor's study-door. <div class="bookquote">``Come in!''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>And
as he (<font color='blue'><b>Doctor</b></font>) enters, the Doctor goes on, to Holmes--<div class="bookquote">``You see, I do not know
anything of the case officially, and if I take any notice of it at all,
I must publicly expel the boy. I don't wish to do that, for I think
there is some good in him (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>). There's nothing for it but a good sound
thrashing.''  (<font color='red'><b>Holmes</b></font>)</div>He (<font color='blue'><b>Doctor</b></font>) paused to shake hands with the master, which Holmes does
also, and then prepares to leave.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``I understand. Good-night, sir.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Good-night, Holmes. And remember,''  (<font color='red'><b>the Doctor</b></font>)</div>added the Doctor, emphasizing the
words, <div class="bookquote">``a good sound thrashing before the whole house.''

 (<font color='red'><b>the Doctor</b></font>)</div><p/>The door closed on Holmes; and the Doctor, in answer to the puzzled
look of his (<font color='blue'><b>Doctor</b></font>) lieutenant, explained shortly. <div class="bookquote">``A gross case of bullying.
Wharton, the head of the house, is a very good fellow, but slight and
weak, and severe physical pain is the only way to deal with such a
case; so I have asked Holmes to take it up. He (<font color='blue'><b>Holmes</b></font>) is very careful and
trustworthy, and has plenty of strength. I wish all the sixth had as
much. We must have it here, if we are to keep order at all.''

 (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div><p/>Now I don't want any wiseacres to read this book, but if they should, of
course they will prick up their long ears, and howl, or rather bray, at
the above story. Very good--I don't object; but what I have to add for
you boys is this, that Holmes called a levy of his (<font color='blue'><b>Holmes</b></font>) house after breakfast
next morning, made them a speech on the case of bullying in question,
and then gave the bully a <div class="bookquote">``good sound thrashing;''  (<font color='red'><b>the bully</b></font>)</div>and that years
afterwards, that boy sought out Holmes, and thanked him (<font color='blue'><b>Holmes</b></font>), saying it
had been the kindest act which had ever been done upon him (<font color='blue'><b>Holmes</b></font>), and the
turning-point in his (<font color='blue'><b>Holmes</b></font>) character; and a very good fellow he (<font color='blue'><b>Holmes</b></font>) became, and a
credit to his (<font color='blue'><b>Holmes</b></font>) School.

<p/>After some other talk between them, the Doctor said, <div class="bookquote">``I want to speak
to you about two boys in your form, East and Brown. I have just been
speaking to them. What do you think of them?''

 (<font color='red'><b>the Doctor</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Well, they are not hard workers, and very thoughtless and full of
spirits; but I can't help liking them. I think they are sound, good
fellows at the bottom.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I'm glad of it. I think so too: But they make me very uneasy. They are
taking the lead a good deal amongst the fags in my house, for they are
very active, bold fellows. I should be sorry to lose them, but I shan't
let them stay if I don't see them gaining character and manliness. In
another year they may do great harm to all the younger boys.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Oh, I hope you won't send them away,''  (<font color='red'><b>master</b></font>)</div>pleaded their master.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Not if I can help it. But now I never feel sure, after any
half-holiday, that I shan't have to flog one of them next morning, for
some foolish, thoughtless scrape. I quite dread seeing either of them.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/>They were both silent for a minute. Presently the Doctor began again:--

<p/><div class="bookquote">``They don't feel that they have any duty or work to do in the school,
and how is one to make them feel it?''

 (<font color='red'><b>the Doctor</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I think if either of them had some little boy to take care of, it would
steady them. Brown is the most reckless of the two, I should say. East
wouldn't get into so many scrapes without him (<font color='blue'><b>Brown</b></font>).''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Well,''  (<font color='red'><b>the Doctor</b></font>)</div>said the Doctor, with something like a sigh, <div class="bookquote">``I'll think of it.''
 (<font color='red'><b>the Doctor</b></font>)</div>And they went on to talk of other subjects.




<p/>PART II.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``I -LSB-hold-RSB- it truth, with him (<font color='blue'><b>Brown</b></font>) who sings,
To one clear harp in divers tones,
That men may rise on stepping-stones
Of their dead selves to higher things.''
 (<font color='red'><b>TENNYSON</b></font>)</div>--TENNYSON.




<p/>CHAPTER I--HOW THE TIDE TURNED.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Once to every man and nation comes the moment to decide,
In the strife of Truth with Falsehood, for the good or evil side.
...
Then it is the brave man chooses, while the coward stands aside,
Doubting in his (<font color='blue'><b>coward</b></font>) abject spirit, till his (<font color='blue'><b>coward</b></font>) Lord is crucified.''
 (<font color='red'><b>LOWELL</b></font>)</div>--LOWELL.

<p/>The turning-point in our hero's school career had now come, and the
manner of it was as follows. On the evening of the first day of the next
half-year, Tom, East, and another School-house boy, who had just been
dropped at the Spread Eagle by the old Regulator, rushed into the
matron's room in high spirits, such as all real boys are in when they
first get back, however fond they may be of home.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Well, Mrs. Wixie,''  (<font color='red'><b>the woman</b></font>)</div>shouted one, seizing on the methodical, active,
little dark-eyed woman, who was busy stowing away the linen of the boys
who had already arrived into their several pigeon-holes, <div class="bookquote">``here we are
again, you see, as jolly as ever. Let us help you put the things away.''

 (<font color='red'><b>the boys</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``And, Mary,''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>cried another -LRB-she (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) was called indifferently by either
name-RRB-, <div class="bookquote">``who's come back? Has the Doctor made old Jones leave? How many
new boys are there?''

 (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Am I and East to have Gray's study? You know you promised to get it for
us if you could,''  (<font color='red'><b>Tom/Brown/Tom Brown</b></font>)</div>shouted Tom.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``And am I to sleep in Number 4?''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>roared East.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``How's old Sam, and Bogle, and Sally?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Bless the boys!''  (<font color='red'><b>Mary</b></font>)</div>cries Mary, at last getting in a word; <div class="bookquote">``why, you'll
shake me to death. There, now, do go away up to the housekeeper's room
and get your suppers; you know I haven't time to talk. You'll find
plenty more in the house.--Now, Master East, do let those things alone.
You're mixing up three new boys' things.''  (<font color='red'><b>Mary</b></font>)</div>And she (<font color='blue'><b>Mary</b></font>) rushed at East, who
escaped round the open trunks holding up a prize.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Hullo! look here, Tommy,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>shouted he (<font color='blue'><b>Tom</b></font>); <div class="bookquote">``here's fun!''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>and he (<font color='blue'><b>Tom</b></font>) brandished
above his (<font color='blue'><b>Tom</b></font>) head some pretty little night-caps, beautifully made and
marked, the work of loving fingers in some distant country home. The
kind mother and sisters who sewed that delicate stitching with aching
hearts little thought of the trouble they might be bringing on the
young head for which they were meant. The little matron was wiser, and
snatched the caps from East before he (<font color='blue'><b>Tom</b></font>) could look at the name on them.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Now, Master East, I shall be very angry if you don't go,''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>said she (<font color='blue'><b>matron</b></font>);
<div class="bookquote">``there's some capital cold beef and pickles upstairs, and I won't have
you old boys in my room first night.''

 (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Hurrah for the pickles! Come along, Tommy--come along, Smith. We shall
find out who the young count is, I'll be bound. I hope he (<font color='blue'><b>Tommy</b></font>)'ll sleep in my
room. Mary's always vicious first week.''

 (<font color='red'><b>the boys</b></font>)</div><p/>As the boys turned to leave the room, the matron touched Tom's arm, and
said, <div class="bookquote">``Master Brown, please stop a minute; I want to speak to you.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Tom/Brown/Tom Brown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Very well, Mary. I'll come in a minute, East. Don't finish the
pickles.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``O Master Brown,''  (<font color='red'><b>the matron</b></font>)</div>went on the little matron, when the rest had gone,
<div class="bookquote">``you're to have Gray's study, Mrs. Arnold says. And she (<font color='blue'><b>Arnold</b></font>) wants you to
take in this young gentleman. He (<font color='blue'><b>gentleman</b></font>)'s a new boy, and thirteen years old
though he (<font color='blue'><b>gentleman</b></font>) don't look it. He (<font color='blue'><b>gentleman</b></font>)'s very delicate, and has never been from
home before. And I told Mrs. Arnold I thought you'd be kind to him (<font color='blue'><b>gentleman</b></font>), and
see that they don't bully him (<font color='blue'><b>bully</b></font>) at first. He (<font color='blue'><b>bully</b></font>)'s put into your form, and
I've given him (<font color='blue'><b>bully</b></font>) the bed next to yours in Number 4; so East can't sleep
there this half.''

 (<font color='red'><b>the matron</b></font>)</div><p/>Tom was rather put about by this speech. He (<font color='blue'><b>Tom</b></font>) had got the double study
which he (<font color='blue'><b>Tom</b></font>) coveted, but here were conditions attached which greatly
moderated his (<font color='blue'><b>Tom</b></font>) joy. He (<font color='blue'><b>Tom</b></font>) looked across the room, and in the far corner of
the sofa was aware of a slight, pale boy, with large blue eyes and light
fair hair, who seemed ready to shrink through the floor. He (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>) saw at a
glance that the little stranger was just the boy whose first half-year
at a public school would be misery to himself if he (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>) were left alone, or
constant anxiety to any one who meant to see him (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>) through his (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>) troubles.
Tom was too honest to take in the youngster, and then let him (<font color='blue'><b>Tom</b></font>) shift for
himself; and if he (<font color='blue'><b>Tom</b></font>) took him (<font color='blue'><b>Tom</b></font>) as his (<font color='blue'><b>Tom</b></font>) chum instead of East, where were
all his (<font color='blue'><b>Tom</b></font>) pet plans of having a bottled-beer cellar under his (<font color='blue'><b>Tom</b></font>) window, and
making night-lines and slings, and plotting expeditions to Brownsover
Mills and Caldecott's Spinney? East and he (<font color='blue'><b>Spinney</b></font>) had made up their minds to
get this study, and then every night from locking-up till ten they would
be together to talk about fishing, drink bottled-beer, read Marryat's
novels, and sort birds' eggs. And this new boy would most likely never
go out of the close, and would be afraid of wet feet, and always getting
laughed at, and called Molly, or Jenny, or some derogatory feminine
nickname.

<p/>The matron watched him (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>) for a moment, and saw what was passing in his (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>)
mind, and so, like a wise negotiator, threw in an appeal to his (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>) warm
heart. <div class="bookquote">``Poor little fellow,''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>said she (<font color='blue'><b>matron</b></font>), in almost a whisper; <div class="bookquote">``his (<font color='blue'><b>fellow</b></font>)
father's dead, and he (<font color='blue'><b>fellow</b></font>)'s got no brothers. And his (<font color='blue'><b>fellow</b></font>) mamma--such a kind,
sweet lady--almost broke her (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) heart at leaving him (<font color='blue'><b>fellow</b></font>) this morning; and she (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>)
said one of his (<font color='blue'><b>fellow</b></font>) sisters was like to die of decline, and so--''

 (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Well, well,''  (<font color='red'><b>Tom/Brown/Tom Brown</b></font>)</div>burst in Tom, with something like a sigh at the effort,
<div class="bookquote">``I suppose I must give up East.--Come along, young un. What's your name?
We'll go and have some supper, and then I'll show you our study.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Tom/Brown/Tom Brown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``His (<font color='blue'><b>fellow</b></font>) name's George Arthur,''  (<font color='red'><b>the matron</b></font>)</div>said the matron, walking up to him (<font color='blue'><b>Tom</b></font>) with Tom,
who grasped his (<font color='blue'><b>Tom</b></font>) little delicate hand as the proper preliminary to making
a chum of him (<font color='blue'><b>Tom</b></font>), and felt as if he (<font color='blue'><b>Tom</b></font>) could have blown him (<font color='blue'><b>Tom</b></font>) away. <div class="bookquote">``I've had
his (<font color='blue'><b>Arthur</b></font>) books and things put into the study, which his (<font color='blue'><b>Arthur</b></font>) mamma has had new
papered, and the sofa covered, and new green-baize curtains over the
door''  (<font color='red'><b>the matron</b></font>)</div>-LRB-the diplomatic matron threw this in, to show that the new boy was
contributing largely to the partnership comforts-RRB-. <div class="bookquote">``And Mrs. Arnold told
me to say,''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>matron</b></font>) added, <div class="bookquote">``that she (<font color='blue'><b>Arnold</b></font>) should like you both to come up to tea
with her (<font color='blue'><b>Arnold</b></font>). You know the way, Master Brown, and the things are just gone
up, I know.''

 (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div><p/>Here was an announcement for Master Tom! He (<font color='blue'><b>Tom</b></font>) was to go up to tea the
first night, just as if he (<font color='blue'><b>Tom</b></font>) were a sixth or fifth form boy, and of
importance in the School world, instead of the most reckless young
scapegrace amongst the fags. He (<font color='blue'><b>Tom</b></font>) felt himself lifted on to a higher
social and moral platform at once. Nevertheless he (<font color='blue'><b>Tom</b></font>) couldn't give up
without a sigh the idea of the jolly supper in the housekeeper's room
with East and the rest, and a rush round to all the studies of his (<font color='blue'><b>Tom</b></font>)
friends afterwards, to pour out the deeds and wonders of the holidays,
to plot fifty plans for the coming half-year, and to gather news of who
had left and what new boys had come, who had got who's study, and where
the new praepostors slept. However, Tom consoled himself with thinking
that he (<font color='blue'><b>Tom</b></font>) couldn't have done all this with the new boy at his (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>) heels, and
so marched off along the passages to the Doctor's private house with his (<font color='blue'><b>Doctor</b></font>)
young charge in tow, in monstrous good-humour with himself and all the
world.

<p/>It is needless, and would be impertinent, to tell how the two young boys
were received in that drawing-room. The lady who presided there is still
living, and has carried with her (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) to her (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) peaceful home in the north the
respect and love of all those who ever felt and shared that gentle and
high-bred hospitality. Ay, many is the brave heart, now doing its work
and bearing its load in country curacies, London chambers, under the
Indian sun, and in Australian towns and clearings, which looks back with
fond and grateful memory to that School-house drawing-room, and dates
much of its highest and best training to the lessons learnt there.

<p/>Besides Mrs. Arnold and one or two of the elder children, there were one
of the younger masters, young Brooke -LRB-who was now in the sixth, and
had succeeded to his (<font color='blue'><b>Brooke</b></font>) brother's position and influence-RRB-, and another
sixth-form boy, talking together before the fire. The master and young
Brooke, now a great strapping fellow six feet high, eighteen years old,
and powerful as a coal-heaver, nodded kindly to Tom, to his (<font color='blue'><b>Tom</b></font>) intense
glory, and then went on talking. The other did not notice them.
The hostess, after a few kind words, which led the boys at once and
insensibly to feel at their ease and to begin talking to one another,
left them with her (<font color='blue'><b>hostess</b></font>) own children while she (<font color='blue'><b>hostess</b></font>) finished a letter. The young
ones got on fast and well, Tom holding forth about a prodigious pony he (<font color='blue'><b>Tom</b></font>)
had been riding out hunting, and hearing stories of the winter glories
of the lakes, when tea came in, and immediately after the Doctor
himself.

<p/>How frank, and kind, and manly was his (<font color='blue'><b>Doctor</b></font>) greeting to the party by the
fire! It did Tom's heart good to see him (<font color='blue'><b>Tom</b></font>) and young Brooke shake hands,
and look one another in the face; and he (<font color='blue'><b>Tom</b></font>) didn't fail to remark that
Brooke was nearly as tall and quite as broad as the Doctor. And his (<font color='blue'><b>Doctor</b></font>) cup
was full when in another moment his (<font color='blue'><b>Doctor</b></font>) master turned to him (<font color='blue'><b>Doctor</b></font>) with another
warm shake of the hand, and, seemingly oblivious of all the late scrapes
which he (<font color='blue'><b>Doctor</b></font>) had been getting into, said, <div class="bookquote">``Ah, Brown, you here! I hope you
left your father and all well at home?''

 (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Yes, sir, quite well.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``And this is the little fellow who is to share your study. Well, he (<font color='blue'><b>fellow</b></font>)
doesn't look as we should like to see him (<font color='blue'><b>fellow</b></font>). He (<font color='blue'><b>fellow</b></font>) wants some Rugby air, and
cricket. And you must take him (<font color='blue'><b>fellow</b></font>) some good long walks, to Bilton Grange,
and Caldecott's Spinney, and show him (<font color='blue'><b>Spinney</b></font>) what a little pretty country we
have about here.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Tom/Brown/Tom Brown</b></font>)</div><p/>Tom wondered if the Doctor knew that his (<font color='blue'><b>Doctor</b></font>) visits to Bilton Grange
were for the purpose of taking rooks' nests -LRB-a proceeding strongly
discountenanced by the owner thereof-RRB-, and those to Caldecott's Spinney
were prompted chiefly by the conveniences for setting night-lines. What
didn't the Doctor know? And what a noble use he (<font color='blue'><b>Doctor</b></font>) always made of it! He (<font color='blue'><b>Doctor</b></font>)
almost resolved to abjure rook-pies and night-lines for ever. The tea
went merrily off, the Doctor now talking of holiday doings, and then of
the prospects of the half-year--what chance there was for the Balliol
scholarship, whether the eleven would be a good one. Everybody was at
his (<font color='blue'><b>Doctor</b></font>) ease, and everybody felt that he (<font color='blue'><b>Doctor</b></font>), young as he (<font color='blue'><b>Doctor</b></font>) might be, was of some
use in the little School world, and had a work to do there.

<p/>Soon after tea the Doctor went off to his (<font color='blue'><b>Doctor</b></font>) study, and the young boys a
few minutes afterwards took their leave and went out of the private door
which led from the Doctor's house into the middle passage.

<p/>At the fire, at the farther end of the passage, was a crowd of boys in
loud talk and laughter. There was a sudden pause when the door opened,
and then a great shout of greeting, as Tom was recognized marching down
the passage.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Hullo, Brown! where do you come from?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Oh, I've been to tea with the Doctor,''  (<font color='red'><b>Tom/Brown/Tom Brown</b></font>)</div>says Tom, with great dignity.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``My eye!''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>cried East, <div class="bookquote">``Oh! so that's why Mary called you back, and you
didn't come to supper. You lost something. That beef and pickles was no
end good.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I say, young fellow,''  (<font color='red'><b>Arthur/George/George Arthur</b></font>)</div>cried Hall, detecting Arthur and catching him (<font color='blue'><b>Arthur</b></font>) by
the collar, <div class="bookquote">``what's your name? Where do you come from? How old are you?''

 (<font color='red'><b>him</b></font>)</div><p/>Tom saw Arthur shrink back and look scared as all the group turned to
him (<font color='blue'><b>Tom</b></font>), but thought it best to let him (<font color='blue'><b>Tom</b></font>) answer, just standing by his (<font color='blue'><b>Tom</b></font>) side to
support in case of need.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Arthur, sir. I come from Devonshire.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Don't call me `sir,' you young muff. How old are you?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Thirteen.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Can you sing?''

 (<font color='red'><b>The boy</b></font>)</div><p/>The poor boy was trembling and hesitating. Tom struck in--<div class="bookquote">``You be
hanged, Tadpole. He (<font color='blue'><b>Arthur</b></font>)'ll have to sing, whether he (<font color='blue'><b>Arthur</b></font>) can or not, Saturday
twelve weeks, and that's long enough off yet.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Tom/Brown/Tom Brown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Do you know him (<font color='blue'><b>Arthur</b></font>) at home, Brown?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``No; but he (<font color='blue'><b>Brown</b></font>)'s my chum in Gray's old study, and it's near prayer-time,
and I haven't had a look at it yet.--Come along, Arthur.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Tom/Brown/Tom Brown</b></font>)</div><p/>Away went the two, Tom longing to get his (<font color='blue'><b>Tom</b></font>) charge safe under cover, where
he (<font color='blue'><b>Tom</b></font>) might advise him (<font color='blue'><b>Tom</b></font>) on his (<font color='blue'><b>Tom</b></font>) deportment.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``What a queer chum for Tom Brown,''  (<font color='red'><b>Tom/Brown/Tom Brown</b></font>)</div>was the comment at the fire; and it
must be confessed so thought Tom himself, as he (<font color='blue'><b>Tom</b></font>) lighted his (<font color='blue'><b>Tom</b></font>) candle, and
surveyed the new green-baize curtains and the carpet and sofa with much
satisfaction.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``I say, Arthur, what a brick your mother is to make us so cozy! But look
here now; you must answer straight up when the fellows speak to you, and
don't be afraid. If you're afraid, you'll get bullied. And don't you
say you can sing; and don't you ever talk about home, or your mother and
sisters.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Arthur/George/George Arthur</b></font>)</div><p/>Poor little Arthur looked ready to cry.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``But, please,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>said he (<font color='blue'><b>Arthur</b></font>), <div class="bookquote">``mayn't I talk about--about home to you?''

 (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Oh yes; I like it. But don't talk to boys you don't know, or they'll
call you home-sick, or mamma's darling, or some such stuff. What a jolly
desk! Is that yours? And what stunning binding! Why, your school-books
look like novels.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Tom/Brown/Tom Brown</b></font>)</div><p/>And Tom was soon deep in Arthur's goods and chattels, all new, and good
enough for a fifth-form boy, and hardly thought of his (<font color='blue'><b>Tom</b></font>) friends outside
till the prayer-bell rang.

<p/>I have already described the School-house prayers. They were the same on
the first night as on the other nights, save for the gaps caused by the
absence of those boys who came late, and the line of new boys who stood
all together at the farther table--of all sorts and sizes, like young
bears with all their troubles to come, as Tom's father had said to him (<font color='blue'><b>Tom</b></font>)
when he (<font color='blue'><b>Tom</b></font>) was in the same position. He (<font color='blue'><b>Tom</b></font>) thought of it as he (<font color='blue'><b>Tom</b></font>) looked at the
line, and poor little slight Arthur standing with them, and as he (<font color='blue'><b>Arthur</b></font>) was
leading him (<font color='blue'><b>Arthur</b></font>) upstairs to Number 4, directly after prayers, and showing
him (<font color='blue'><b>Arthur</b></font>) his (<font color='blue'><b>Arthur</b></font>) bed. It was a huge, high, airy room, with two large windows
looking on to the School close. There were twelve beds in the room. The
one in the farthest corner by the fireplace, occupied by the sixth-form
boy, who was responsible for the discipline of the room, and the rest
by boys in the lower-fifth and other junior forms, all fags -LRB-for the
fifth-form boys, as has been said, slept in rooms by themselves-RRB-. Being
fags, the eldest of them was not more than about sixteen years old, and
were all bound to be up and in bed by ten. The sixth-form boys came to
bed from ten to a quarter-past -LRB-at which time the old verger came round
to put the candles out-RRB-, except when they sat up to read.

<p/>Within a few minutes therefore of their entry, all the other boys who
slept in Number 4 had come up. The little fellows went quietly to their
own beds, and began undressing, and talking to each other in whispers;
while the elder, amongst whom was Tom, sat chatting about on one
another's beds, with their jackets and waistcoats off. Poor little
Arthur was overwhelmed with the novelty of his (<font color='blue'><b>Arthur</b></font>) position. The idea of
sleeping in the room with strange boys had clearly never crossed his (<font color='blue'><b>Arthur</b></font>)
mind before, and was as painful as it was strange to him (<font color='blue'><b>Arthur</b></font>). He (<font color='blue'><b>Arthur</b></font>) could
hardly bear to take his (<font color='blue'><b>Arthur</b></font>) jacket off; however, presently, with an effort,
off it came, and then he (<font color='blue'><b>Arthur</b></font>) paused and looked at Tom, who was sitting at
the bottom of his (<font color='blue'><b>Tom</b></font>) bed talking and laughing.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Please, Brown,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Tom</b></font>) whispered, <div class="bookquote">``may I wash my face and hands?''

 (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Of course, if you like,''  (<font color='red'><b>Tom/Brown/Tom Brown</b></font>)</div>said Tom, staring; <div class="bookquote">``that's your
washhand-stand, under the window, second from your bed. You'll have to
go down for more water in the morning if you use it all.''  (<font color='red'><b>Tom/Brown/Tom Brown</b></font>)</div>And on he (<font color='blue'><b>Tom</b></font>) went
with his (<font color='blue'><b>Tom</b></font>) talk, while Arthur stole timidly from between the beds out
to his (<font color='blue'><b>Arthur</b></font>) washhand-stand, and began his (<font color='blue'><b>Arthur</b></font>) ablutions, thereby drawing for a
moment on himself the attention of the room.

<p/>On went the talk and laughter. Arthur finished his (<font color='blue'><b>Arthur</b></font>) washing and
undressing, and put on his (<font color='blue'><b>Arthur</b></font>) night-gown. He (<font color='blue'><b>Arthur</b></font>) then looked round more
nervously than ever. Two or three of the little boys were already in
bed, sitting up with their chins on their knees. The light burned clear,
the noise went on. It was a trying moment for the poor little lonely
boy; however, this time he (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>) didn't ask Tom what he (<font color='blue'><b>Tom</b></font>) might or might not do,
but dropped on his (<font color='blue'><b>Tom</b></font>) knees by his (<font color='blue'><b>Tom</b></font>) bedside, as he (<font color='blue'><b>Tom</b></font>) had done every day from
his (<font color='blue'><b>Tom</b></font>) childhood, to open his (<font color='blue'><b>Tom</b></font>) heart to Him (<font color='blue'><b>Tom</b></font>) who heareth the cry and beareth
the sorrows of the tender child, and the strong man in agony.

<p/>Tom was sitting at the bottom of his (<font color='blue'><b>Tom</b></font>) bed unlacing his (<font color='blue'><b>Tom</b></font>) boots, so that his (<font color='blue'><b>Tom</b></font>)
back was towards Arthur, and he (<font color='blue'><b>Arthur</b></font>) didn't see what had happened, and looked
up in wonder at the sudden silence. Then two or three boys laughed and
sneered, and a big, brutal fellow who was standing in the middle of the
room picked up a slipper, and shied it at the kneeling boy, calling him (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>)
a snivelling young shaver. Then Tom saw the whole, and the next moment
the boot he (<font color='blue'><b>Tom</b></font>) had just pulled off flew straight at the head of the bully,
who had just time to throw up his (<font color='blue'><b>Tom</b></font>) arm and catch it on his (<font color='blue'><b>Tom</b></font>) elbow.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Confound you, Brown! what's that for?''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>roared he (<font color='blue'><b>Tom</b></font>), stamping with pain.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Never mind what I mean,''  (<font color='red'><b>Tom/Brown/Tom Brown</b></font>)</div>said Tom, stepping on to the floor, every drop
of blood in his (<font color='blue'><b>Tom</b></font>) body tingling; <div class="bookquote">``if any fellow wants the other boot, he (<font color='blue'><b>Brown</b></font>)
knows how to get it.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Tom/Brown/Tom Brown</b></font>)</div><p/>What would have been the result is doubtful, for at this moment the
sixth-form boy came in, and not another word could be said. Tom and
the rest rushed into bed and finished their unrobing there, and the
old verger, as punctual as the clock, had put out the candle in another
minute, and toddled on to the next room, shutting their door with his (<font color='blue'><b>Tom</b></font>)
usual <div class="bookquote">``Good-night, gen'lm’n.''

 (<font color='red'><b>the verger</b></font>)</div><p/>There were many boys in the room by whom that little scene was taken to
heart before they slept. But sleep seemed to have deserted the pillow of
poor Tom. For some time his (<font color='blue'><b>Tom</b></font>) excitement, and the flood of memories
which chased one another through his (<font color='blue'><b>Tom</b></font>) brain, kept him (<font color='blue'><b>Tom</b></font>) from thinking or
resolving. His (<font color='blue'><b>Tom</b></font>) head throbbed, his (<font color='blue'><b>Tom</b></font>) heart leapt, and he (<font color='blue'><b>Tom</b></font>) could hardly keep
himself from springing out of bed and rushing about the room. Then the
thought of his (<font color='blue'><b>Tom</b></font>) own mother came across him (<font color='blue'><b>Tom</b></font>), and the promise he (<font color='blue'><b>Tom</b></font>) had made
at her (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) knee, years ago, never to forget to kneel by his (<font color='blue'><b>Tom</b></font>) bedside, and
give himself up to his (<font color='blue'><b>Tom</b></font>) Father, before he (<font color='blue'><b>Tom</b></font>) laid his (<font color='blue'><b>Tom</b></font>) head on the pillow,
from which it might never rise; and he (<font color='blue'><b>Tom</b></font>) lay down gently, and cried as if
his (<font color='blue'><b>Tom</b></font>) heart would break. He (<font color='blue'><b>Tom</b></font>) was only fourteen years old.

<p/>It was no light act of courage in those days, my dear boys, for a little
fellow to say his (<font color='blue'><b>fellow</b></font>) prayers publicly, even at Rugby. A few years later,
when Arnold's manly piety had begun to leaven the School, the tables
turned; before he (<font color='blue'><b>fellow</b></font>) died, in the School-house at least, and I believe in
the other house, the rule was the other way. But poor Tom had come to
school in other times. The first few nights after he (<font color='blue'><b>Tom</b></font>) came he (<font color='blue'><b>Tom</b></font>) did not
kneel down because of the noise, but sat up in bed till the candle was
out, and then stole out and said his (<font color='blue'><b>Tom</b></font>) prayers, in fear lest some one
should find him (<font color='blue'><b>Tom</b></font>) out. So did many another poor little fellow. Then he (<font color='blue'><b>fellow</b></font>)
began to think that he (<font color='blue'><b>fellow</b></font>) might just as well say his (<font color='blue'><b>fellow</b></font>) prayers in bed, and
then that it didn't matter whether he (<font color='blue'><b>fellow</b></font>) was kneeling, or sitting, or lying
down. And so it had come to pass with Tom, as with all who will not
confess their Lord before men; and for the last year he (<font color='blue'><b>Tom</b></font>) had probably not
said his (<font color='blue'><b>Tom</b></font>) prayers in earnest a dozen times.

<p/>Poor Tom! the first and bitterest feeling which was like to break his (<font color='blue'><b>Tom</b></font>)
heart was the sense of his (<font color='blue'><b>Tom</b></font>) own cowardice. The vice of all others which
he (<font color='blue'><b>Tom</b></font>) loathed was brought in and burnt in on his (<font color='blue'><b>Tom</b></font>) own soul. He (<font color='blue'><b>Tom</b></font>) had lied to
his (<font color='blue'><b>Tom</b></font>) mother, to his (<font color='blue'><b>Tom</b></font>) conscience, to his (<font color='blue'><b>Tom</b></font>) God. How could he (<font color='blue'><b>Tom</b></font>) bear it? And
then the poor little weak boy, whom he (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>) had pitied and almost scorned for
his (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>) weakness, had done that which he (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>), braggart as he (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>) was, dared not do.
The first dawn of comfort came to him (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>) in swearing to himself that he (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>)
would stand by that boy through thick and thin, and cheer him (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>), and help
him (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>), and bear his (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>) burdens for the good deed done that night. Then he (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>)
resolved to write home next day and tell his (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>) mother all, and what a
coward her (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) son had been. And then peace came to him (<font color='blue'><b>son</b></font>) as he (<font color='blue'><b>son</b></font>) resolved,
lastly, to bear his (<font color='blue'><b>son</b></font>) testimony next morning. The morning would be harder
than the night to begin with, but he (<font color='blue'><b>son</b></font>) felt that he (<font color='blue'><b>son</b></font>) could not afford to
let one chance slip. Several times he (<font color='blue'><b>son</b></font>) faltered, for the devil showed him (<font color='blue'><b>son</b></font>)
first all his (<font color='blue'><b>son</b></font>) old friends calling him (<font color='blue'><b>son</b></font>) <div class="bookquote">``Saint''  (<font color='red'><b>him</b></font>)</div>and <div class="bookquote">``Square-toes,''  (<font color='red'><b>him</b></font>)</div>and
a dozen hard names, and whispered to him (<font color='blue'><b>son</b></font>) that his (<font color='blue'><b>son</b></font>) motives would be
misunderstood, and he (<font color='blue'><b>son</b></font>) would only be left alone with the new boy; whereas
it was his (<font color='blue'><b>son</b></font>) duty to keep all means of influence, that he (<font color='blue'><b>son</b></font>) might do good to
the largest number. And then came the more subtle temptation, <div class="bookquote">``Shall I
not be showing myself braver than others by doing this? Have I any right
to begin it now? Ought I not rather to pray in my own study, letting
other boys know that I do so, and trying to lead them to it, while in
public at least I should go on as I have done?''  (<font color='red'><b>angel</b></font>)</div>However, his (<font color='blue'><b>son</b></font>) good angel
was too strong that night, and he (<font color='blue'><b>son</b></font>) turned on his (<font color='blue'><b>son</b></font>) side and slept, tired of
trying to reason, but resolved to follow the impulse which had been so
strong, and in which he (<font color='blue'><b>son</b></font>) had found peace.

<p/>Next morning he (<font color='blue'><b>son</b></font>) was up and washed and dressed, all but his (<font color='blue'><b>son</b></font>) jacket and
waistcoat, just as the ten minutes' bell began to ring, and then in
the face of the whole room knelt down to pray. Not five words could
he (<font color='blue'><b>son</b></font>) say--the bell mocked him (<font color='blue'><b>son</b></font>); he (<font color='blue'><b>son</b></font>) was listening for every whisper in
the room--what were they all thinking of him (<font color='blue'><b>son</b></font>)? He (<font color='blue'><b>son</b></font>) was ashamed to go on
kneeling, ashamed to rise from his (<font color='blue'><b>son</b></font>) knees. At last, as it were from his (<font color='blue'><b>son</b></font>)
inmost heart, a still, small voice seemed to breathe forth the words of
the publican, <div class="bookquote">``God be merciful to me a sinner!''  (<font color='red'><b>the publican</b></font>)</div>He (<font color='blue'><b>publican</b></font>) repeated them over
and over, clinging to them as for his (<font color='blue'><b>publican</b></font>) life, and rose from his (<font color='blue'><b>publican</b></font>) knees
comforted and humbled, and ready to face the whole world. It was not
needed: two other boys besides Arthur had already followed his (<font color='blue'><b>Arthur</b></font>) example,
and he (<font color='blue'><b>Arthur</b></font>) went down to the great School with a glimmering of another lesson
in his (<font color='blue'><b>Arthur</b></font>) heart--the lesson that he (<font color='blue'><b>Arthur</b></font>) who has conquered his (<font color='blue'><b>Arthur</b></font>) own coward spirit
has conquered the whole outward world; and that other one which the old
prophet learnt in the cave in Mount Horeb, when he (<font color='blue'><b>prophet</b></font>) hid his (<font color='blue'><b>prophet</b></font>) face, and the
still, small voice asked, <div class="bookquote">``What doest thou here, Elijah?''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>that however
we may fancy ourselves alone on the side of good, the King and Lord
of men is nowhere without His (<font color='blue'><b>King</b></font>) witnesses; for in every society, however
seemingly corrupt and godless, there are those who have not bowed the
knee to Baal.

<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>King</b></font>) found, too, how greatly he (<font color='blue'><b>King</b></font>) had exaggerated the effect to be produced
by his (<font color='blue'><b>King</b></font>) act. For a few nights there was a sneer or a laugh when he (<font color='blue'><b>King</b></font>) knelt
down, but this passed off soon, and one by one all the other boys but
three or four followed the lead. I fear that this was in some measure
owing to the fact that Tom could probably have thrashed any boy in the
room except the praepostor; at any rate, every boy knew that he (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>) would
try upon very slight provocation, and didn't choose to run the risk of a
hard fight because Tom Brown had taken a fancy to say his (<font color='blue'><b>Brown</b></font>) prayers. Some
of the small boys of Number 4 communicated the new state of things to
their chums, and in several other rooms the poor little fellows tried
it on--in one instance or so, where the praepostor heard of it and
interfered very decidedly, with partial success; but in the rest, after
a short struggle, the confessors were bullied or laughed down, and the
old state of things went on for some time longer. Before either Tom
Brown or Arthur left the School-house, there was no room in which it had
not become the regular custom. I trust it is so still, and that the old
heathen state of things has gone out for ever.



<p/>CHAPTER II--THE NEW BOY.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``And Heaven's rich instincts in him (<font color='blue'><b>Elijah</b></font>) grew
As effortless as woodland nooks
Send violets up and paint them blue.'' (<font color='red'><b>LOWELL</b></font>)</div>--LOWELL.

<p/>I do not mean to recount all the little troubles and annoyances which
thronged upon Tom at the beginning of this half-year, in his (<font color='blue'><b>Tom</b></font>) new
character of bear-leader to a gentle little boy straight from home. He (<font color='blue'><b>Tom</b></font>)
seemed to himself to have become a new boy again, without any of the
long-suffering and meekness indispensable for supporting that character
with moderate success. From morning till night he (<font color='blue'><b>character</b></font>) had the feeling of
responsibility on his (<font color='blue'><b>character</b></font>) mind, and even if he (<font color='blue'><b>character</b></font>) left Arthur in their study
or in the close for an hour, was never at ease till he (<font color='blue'><b>character</b></font>) had him (<font color='blue'><b>character</b></font>) in sight
again. He (<font color='blue'><b>character</b></font>) waited for him (<font color='blue'><b>character</b></font>) at the doors of the school after every lesson
and every calling-over; watched that no tricks were played him (<font color='blue'><b>character</b></font>), and none
but the regulation questions asked; kept his (<font color='blue'><b>character</b></font>) eye on his (<font color='blue'><b>character</b></font>) plate at dinner
and breakfast, to see that no unfair depredations were made upon his (<font color='blue'><b>character</b></font>)
viands; in short, as East remarked, cackled after him (<font color='blue'><b>character</b></font>) like a hen with
one chick.

<p/>Arthur took a long time thawing, too, which made it all the harder work;
was sadly timid; scarcely ever spoke unless Tom spoke to him (<font color='blue'><b>Tom</b></font>) first; and,
worst of all, would agree with him (<font color='blue'><b>Tom</b></font>) in everything--the hardest thing in
the world for a Brown to bear. He (<font color='blue'><b>Tom</b></font>) got quite angry sometimes, as they
sat together of a night in their study, at this provoking habit of
agreement, and was on the point of breaking out a dozen times with a
lecture upon the propriety of a fellow having a will of his (<font color='blue'><b>Tom</b></font>) own and
speaking out, but managed to restrain himself by the thought that he (<font color='blue'><b>Tom</b></font>)
might only frighten Arthur, and the remembrance of the lesson he (<font color='blue'><b>Arthur</b></font>) had
learnt from him (<font color='blue'><b>Arthur</b></font>) on his (<font color='blue'><b>Arthur</b></font>) first night at Number 4. Then he (<font color='blue'><b>Arthur</b></font>) would resolve to
sit still and not say a word till Arthur began; but he (<font color='blue'><b>Arthur</b></font>) was always beat
at that game, and had presently to begin talking in despair, fearing
lest Arthur might think he (<font color='blue'><b>Arthur</b></font>) was vexed at something if he (<font color='blue'><b>Arthur</b></font>) didn't, and
dog-tired of sitting tongue-tied.

<p/>It was hard work. But Tom had taken it up, and meant to stick to it, and
go through with it so as to satisfy himself; in which resolution he (<font color='blue'><b>Tom</b></font>)
was much assisted by the chafing of East and his (<font color='blue'><b>Tom</b></font>) other old friends, who
began to call him (<font color='blue'><b>Tom</b></font>) <div class="bookquote">``dry-nurse,''  (<font color='red'><b>him</b></font>)</div>and otherwise to break their small wit
on him (<font color='blue'><b>Tom</b></font>). But when they took other ground, as they did every now and then,
Tom was sorely puzzled.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Tell you what, Tommy,''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>East would say; <div class="bookquote">``you'll spoil young Hopeful with
too much coddling. Why can't you let him (<font color='blue'><b>Tommy</b></font>) go about by himself and find
his (<font color='blue'><b>Tommy</b></font>) own level? He (<font color='blue'><b>Tommy</b></font>)'ll never be worth a button if you go on keeping him (<font color='blue'><b>Tommy</b></font>)
under your skirts.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Well, but he (<font color='blue'><b>Tommy</b></font>) ain't fit to fight his (<font color='blue'><b>Tommy</b></font>) own way yet; I'm trying to get him (<font color='blue'><b>Tommy</b></font>)
to it every day, but he (<font color='blue'><b>Tommy</b></font>)'s very odd. Poor little beggar! I can't make him (<font color='blue'><b>Tommy</b></font>)
out a bit. He (<font color='blue'><b>Tommy</b></font>) ain't a bit like anything I've ever seen or heard of--he (<font color='blue'><b>Tommy</b></font>)
seems all over nerves; anything you say seems to hurt him (<font color='blue'><b>Tommy</b></font>) like a cut or
a blow.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``That sort of boy's no use here,''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>said East; <div class="bookquote">``he (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>)'ll only spoil. Now I'll
tell you what to do, Tommy. Go and get a nice large band-box made, and
put him (<font color='blue'><b>Tommy</b></font>) in with plenty of cotton-wool and a pap-bottle, labelled `With
care--this side up,' and send him (<font color='blue'><b>Tommy</b></font>) back to mamma.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I think I shall make a hand of him (<font color='blue'><b>Tommy</b></font>) though,''  (<font color='red'><b>Tom/Brown/Tom Brown</b></font>)</div>said Tom, smiling, <div class="bookquote">``say
what you will. There's something about him (<font color='blue'><b>Tommy</b></font>), every now and then, which
shows me he (<font color='blue'><b>Tommy</b></font>)'s got pluck somewhere in him (<font color='blue'><b>Tommy</b></font>). That's the only thing after
all that'll wash, ain't it, old Scud? But how to get at it and bring it
out?''

 (<font color='red'><b>Tom/Brown/Tom Brown</b></font>)</div><p/>Tom took one hand out of his (<font color='blue'><b>Tom</b></font>) breeches-pocket and stuck it in his (<font color='blue'><b>Tom</b></font>) back
hair for a scratch, giving his (<font color='blue'><b>Tom</b></font>) hat a tilt over his (<font color='blue'><b>Tom</b></font>) nose, his (<font color='blue'><b>Tom</b></font>) one method
of invoking wisdom. He (<font color='blue'><b>Tom</b></font>) stared at the ground with a ludicrously puzzled
look, and presently looked up and met East's eyes. That young gentleman
slapped him (<font color='blue'><b>gentleman</b></font>) on the back, and then put his (<font color='blue'><b>gentleman</b></font>) arm round his (<font color='blue'><b>gentleman</b></font>) shoulder, as
they strolled through the quadrangle together. <div class="bookquote">``Tom,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>said he (<font color='blue'><b>gentleman</b></font>), <div class="bookquote">``blest if
you ain't the best old fellow ever was. I do like to see you go into a
thing. Hang it, I wish I could take things as you do; but I never
can get higher than a joke. Everything's a joke. If I was going to be
flogged next minute, I should be in a blue funk, but I couldn't help
laughing at it for the life of me.''

 (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Brown and East, you go and fag for Jones on the great fives court.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Hullo, though, that's past a joke,''  (<font color='red'><b>the gentleman</b></font>)</div>broke out East, springing at
the young gentleman who addressed them, and catching him (<font color='blue'><b>gentleman</b></font>) by the
collar.--<div class="bookquote">``Here, Tommy, catch hold of him (<font color='blue'><b>Tommy</b></font>) t'other side before he (<font color='blue'><b>Tommy</b></font>) can
holla.''

 (<font color='red'><b>The youth</b></font>)</div><p/>The youth was seized, and dragged, struggling, out of the quadrangle
into the School-house hall. He (<font color='blue'><b>gentleman</b></font>) was one of the miserable little pretty
white-handed, curly-headed boys, petted and pampered by some of the big
fellows, who wrote their verses for them, taught them to drink and use
bad language, and did all they could to spoil them for everything *
in this world and the next. One of the avocations in which these young
gentlemen took particular delight was in going about and getting fags
for their protectors, when those heroes were playing any game. They
carried about pencil and paper with them, putting down the names of all
the boys they sent, always sending five times as many as were wanted,
and getting all those thrashed who didn't go. The present youth belonged
to a house which was very jealous of the School-house, and always picked
out School-house fags when he (<font color='blue'><b>They</b></font>) could find them. However, this time he (<font color='blue'><b>They</b></font>)'d
got the wrong sow by the ear. His (<font color='blue'><b>They</b></font>) captors slammed the great door of the
hall, and East put his (<font color='blue'><b>They</b></font>) back against it, while Tom gave the prisoner a
shake up, took away his (<font color='blue'><b>Tom</b></font>) list, and stood him (<font color='blue'><b>Tom</b></font>) up on the floor, while he (<font color='blue'><b>Tom</b></font>)
proceeded leisurely to examine that document.

<p/>* A kind and wise critic, an old Rugboean, notes here in the
margin: <div class="bookquote">``The small friend system was not so utterly bad from
1841-1847.''  (<font color='red'><b>critic</b></font>)</div>Before that, too, there were many noble
friendships between big and little boys; but I can't strike
out the passage. Many boys will know why it is left in.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Let me out, let me go!''  (<font color='red'><b>the boy</b></font>)</div>screamed the boy, in a furious passion. <div class="bookquote">``I'll
go and tell Jones this minute, and he (<font color='blue'><b>Jones</b></font>)'ll give you both the -- thrashing
you ever had.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Pretty little dear,''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>said East, patting the top of his (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>) hat.--<div class="bookquote">``Hark how
he (<font color='blue'><b>Jones</b></font>) swears, Tom. Nicely brought up young man, ain't he (<font color='blue'><b>Jones</b></font>), I don't think.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Let me alone, -- you,''  (<font color='red'><b>the boy</b></font>)</div>roared the boy, foaming with rage, and kicking
at East, who quietly tripped him (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>) up, and deposited him (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>) on the floor in a
place of safety.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Gently, young fellow,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>said he (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>); ```tain't improving for little
whippersnappers like you to be indulging in blasphemy; so you stop that,
or you'll get something you won't like.''

<p/><div class="bookquote">``I'll have you both licked when I get out, that I will,''  (<font color='red'><b>the boy</b></font>)</div>rejoined the
boy, beginning to snivel.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Two can play at that game, mind you,''  (<font color='red'><b>Tom/Brown/Tom Brown</b></font>)</div>said Tom, who had finished his (<font color='blue'><b>Tom</b></font>)
examination of the list. <div class="bookquote">``Now you just listen here. We've just come
across the fives court, and Jones has four fags there already--two
more than he (<font color='blue'><b>Jones</b></font>) wants. If he (<font color='blue'><b>Jones</b></font>)'d wanted us to change, he (<font color='blue'><b>Jones</b></font>)'d have stopped us
himself. And here, you little blackguard, you've got seven names down on
your list besides ours, and five of them School-house.''  (<font color='red'><b>Tom/Brown/Tom Brown</b></font>)</div>Tom walked up to
him (<font color='blue'><b>Tom</b></font>), and jerked him (<font color='blue'><b>Tom</b></font>) on to his (<font color='blue'><b>Tom</b></font>) legs; he (<font color='blue'><b>Tom</b></font>) was by this time whining like a
whipped puppy. <div class="bookquote">``Now just listen to me. We ain't going to fag for
Jones. If you tell him (<font color='blue'><b>Jones</b></font>) you've sent us, we'll each of us give you such
a thrashing as you'll remember.''  (<font color='red'><b>Tom/Brown/Tom Brown</b></font>)</div>And Tom tore up the list and threw the
pieces into the fire.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``And mind you, too,''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>said East, <div class="bookquote">``don't let me catch you again sneaking
about the School-house, and picking up our fags. You haven't got the
sort of hide to take a sound licking kindly.''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>And he (<font color='blue'><b>Tom</b></font>) opened the door and
sent the young gentleman flying into the quadrangle with a parting kick.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Nice boy, Tommy,''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>said East, shoving his (<font color='blue'><b>Tom</b></font>) hands in his (<font color='blue'><b>Tom</b></font>) pockets, and
strolling to the fire.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Worst sort we breed,''  (<font color='red'><b>Tom/Brown/Tom Brown</b></font>)</div>responded Tom, following his (<font color='blue'><b>Tom</b></font>) example. <div class="bookquote">``Thank
goodness, no big fellow ever took to petting me.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``You'd never have been like that,''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>said East. <div class="bookquote">``I should like to have put
him (<font color='blue'><b>fellow</b></font>) in a museum: Christian young gentleman, nineteenth century, highly
educated. Stir him (<font color='blue'><b>Christian</b></font>) up with a long pole, Jack, and hear him (<font color='blue'><b>Jack</b></font>) swear like a
drunken sailor. He (<font color='blue'><b>Jack</b></font>)'d make a respectable public open its eyes, I think.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Think he (<font color='blue'><b>Jack</b></font>)'ll tell Jones?''  (<font color='red'><b>Tom/Brown/Tom Brown</b></font>)</div>said Tom.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``No,''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>said East. <div class="bookquote">``Don't care if he (<font color='blue'><b>Jack</b></font>) does.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Nor I,''  (<font color='red'><b>Tom/Brown/Tom Brown</b></font>)</div>said Tom. And they went back to talk about Arthur.

<p/>The young gentleman had brains enough not to tell Jones, reasoning
that East and Brown, who were noted as some of the toughest fags in
the School, wouldn't care three straws for any licking Jones might give
them, and would be likely to keep their words as to passing it on with
interest.

<p/>After the above conversation, East came a good deal to their study, and
took notice of Arthur, and soon allowed to Tom that he (<font color='blue'><b>Tom</b></font>) was a thorough
little gentleman, and would get over his (<font color='blue'><b>Tom</b></font>) shyness all in good time; which
much comforted our hero. He (<font color='blue'><b>Tom</b></font>) felt every day, too, the value of having an
object in his (<font color='blue'><b>Tom</b></font>) life--something that drew him (<font color='blue'><b>Tom</b></font>) out of himself; and it being
the dull time of the year, and no games going about for which he (<font color='blue'><b>Tom</b></font>) much
cared, was happier than he (<font color='blue'><b>Tom</b></font>) had ever yet been at school, which was saying
a great deal.

<p/>The time which Tom allowed himself away from his (<font color='blue'><b>Tom</b></font>) charge was from
locking-up till supper-time. During this hour or hour and a half he (<font color='blue'><b>Tom</b></font>) used
to take his (<font color='blue'><b>Tom</b></font>) fling, going round to the studies of all his (<font color='blue'><b>Tom</b></font>) acquaintance,
sparring or gossiping in the hall, now jumping the old iron-bound
tables, or carving a bit of his (<font color='blue'><b>Tom</b></font>) name on them, then joining in some
chorus of merry voices--in fact, blowing off his (<font color='blue'><b>Tom</b></font>) steam, as we should now
call it.

<p/>This process was so congenial to his (<font color='blue'><b>Tom</b></font>) temper, and Arthur showed himself
so pleased at the arrangement, that it was several weeks before Tom was
ever in their study before supper. One evening, however, he (<font color='blue'><b>Tom</b></font>) rushed in to
look for an old chisel, or some corks, or other article essential to his (<font color='blue'><b>Tom</b></font>)
pursuit for the time being, and while rummaging about in the cupboards,
looked up for a moment, and was caught at once by the figure of poor
little Arthur. The boy was sitting with his (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>) elbows on the table, and
his (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>) head leaning on his (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>) hands, and before him (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>) an open book, on which his (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>)
tears were falling fast. Tom shut the door at once, and sat down on the
sofa by Arthur, putting his (<font color='blue'><b>Arthur</b></font>) arm round his (<font color='blue'><b>Arthur</b></font>) neck.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Why, young un, what's the matter?''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>said he (<font color='blue'><b>Arthur</b></font>) kindly; <div class="bookquote">``you ain't unhappy,
are you?''

 (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Oh no, Brown,''  (<font color='red'><b>the boy</b></font>)</div>said the little boy, looking up with the great tears in
his (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>) eyes; <div class="bookquote">``you are so kind to me, I'm very happy.''

 (<font color='red'><b>the boy</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Why don't you call me Tom? Lots of boys do that I don't like half so
much as you. What are you reading, then? Hang it! you must come about
with me, and not mope yourself.''  (<font color='red'><b>Tom/Brown/Tom Brown</b></font>)</div>And Tom cast down his (<font color='blue'><b>Tom</b></font>) eyes on the book,
and saw it was the Bible. He (<font color='blue'><b>Tom</b></font>) was silent for a minute, and thought to
himself, <div class="bookquote">``Lesson Number 2, Tom Brown;''  (<font color='red'><b>He</b></font>)</div>and then said gently, <div class="bookquote">``I'm very
glad to see this, Arthur, and ashamed that I don't read the Bible more
myself. Do you read it every night before supper while I'm out?''

 (<font color='red'><b>He</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Yes.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Well, I wish you'd wait till afterwards, and then we'd read together.
But, Arthur, why does it make you cry?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Oh, it isn't that I'm unhappy. But at home, while my father was alive,
we always read the lessons after tea; and I love to read them over now,
and try to remember what he (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) said about them. I can't remember all and I
think I scarcely understand a great deal of what I do remember. But
it all comes back to me so fresh that I can't help crying sometimes to
think I shall never read them again with him (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>).''

 (<font color='red'><b>Arthur/George/George Arthur</b></font>)</div><p/>Arthur had never spoken of his (<font color='blue'><b>Arthur</b></font>) home before, and Tom hadn't encouraged
him (<font color='blue'><b>Tom</b></font>) to do so, as his (<font color='blue'><b>Tom</b></font>) blundering schoolboy reasoning made him (<font color='blue'><b>Tom</b></font>) think that
Arthur would be softened and less manly for thinking of home. But now
he (<font color='blue'><b>Arthur</b></font>) was fairly interested, and forgot all about chisels and bottled
beer; while with very little encouragement Arthur launched into his (<font color='blue'><b>Arthur</b></font>) home
history, and the prayer-bell put them both out sadly when it rang to
call them to the hall.

<p/>From this time Arthur constantly spoke of his (<font color='blue'><b>Arthur</b></font>) home, and above all, of
his (<font color='blue'><b>Arthur</b></font>) father, who had been dead about a year, and whose memory Tom soon
got to love and reverence almost as much as his (<font color='blue'><b>Tom</b></font>) own son did.

<p/>Arthur's father had been the clergyman of a parish in the Midland
counties, which had risen into a large town during the war, and upon
which the hard years which followed had fallen with fearful weight. The
trade had been half ruined; and then came the old, sad story, of masters
reducing their establishments, men turned off and wandering about,
hungry and wan in body, and fierce in soul, from the thought of wives
and children starving at home, and the last sticks of furniture going to
the pawnshop; children taken from school, and lounging about the dirty
streets and courts, too listless almost to play, and squalid in rags
and misery; and then the fearful struggle between the employers and
men--lowerings of wages, strikes, and the long course of oft-repeated
crime, ending every now and then with a riot, a fire, and the county
yeomanry. There is no need here to dwell upon such tales: the Englishman
into whose soul they have not sunk deep is not worthy the name. You
English boys, for whom this book is meant -LRB-God bless your bright faces
and kind hearts!-RRB-, will learn it all soon enough.

<p/>Into such a parish and state of society Arthur's father had been thrown
at the age of twenty-five--a young married parson, full of faith,
hope, and love. He (<font color='blue'><b>parson</b></font>) had battled with it like a man, and had lots of fine
Utopian ideas about the perfectibility of mankind, glorious humanity,
and such-like, knocked out of his (<font color='blue'><b>parson</b></font>) head, and a real, wholesome Christian
love for the poor, struggling, sinning men, of whom he (<font color='blue'><b>parson</b></font>) felt himself one,
and with and for whom he (<font color='blue'><b>parson</b></font>) spent fortune, and strength, and life, driven
into his (<font color='blue'><b>parson</b></font>) heart. He (<font color='blue'><b>parson</b></font>) had battled like a man, and gotten a man's reward--no
silver tea-pots or salvers, with flowery inscriptions setting forth
his (<font color='blue'><b>parson</b></font>) virtues and the appreciation of a genteel parish; no fat living or
stall, for which he (<font color='blue'><b>parson</b></font>) never looked, and didn't care; no sighs and praises
of comfortable dowagers and well-got-up young women, who worked him (<font color='blue'><b>parson</b></font>)
slippers, sugared his (<font color='blue'><b>parson</b></font>) tea, and adored him (<font color='blue'><b>parson</b></font>) as <div class="bookquote">``a devoted man;''  (<font color='red'><b>him</b></font>)</div>but a
manly respect, wrung from the unwilling souls of men who fancied his (<font color='blue'><b>parson</b></font>)
order their natural enemies; the fear and hatred of every one who was
false or unjust in the district, were he (<font color='blue'><b>parson</b></font>) master or man; and the blessed
sight of women and children daily becoming more human and more homely, a
comfort to themselves and to their husbands and fathers.

<p/>These things, of course, took time, and had to be fought for with toil
and sweat of brain and heart, and with the life-blood poured out. All
that, Arthur had laid his (<font color='blue'><b>Arthur</b></font>) account to give, and took as a matter of
course, neither pitying himself, nor looking on himself as a martyr,
when he (<font color='blue'><b>martyr</b></font>) felt the wear and tear making him (<font color='blue'><b>martyr</b></font>) feel old before his (<font color='blue'><b>martyr</b></font>) time, and
the stifling air of fever-dens telling on his (<font color='blue'><b>martyr</b></font>) health. His (<font color='blue'><b>martyr</b></font>) wife seconded
him (<font color='blue'><b>martyr</b></font>) in everything. She (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>) had been rather fond of society, and much admired
and run after before her (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>) marriage; and the London world to which she (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>) had
belonged pitied poor Fanny Evelyn when she (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>) married the young clergyman,
and went to settle in that smoky hole Turley; a very nest of Chartism
and Atheism, in a part of the country which all the decent families had
had to leave for years. However, somehow or other she (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>) didn't seem to
care. If her (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>) husband's living had been amongst green fields and near
pleasant neighbours she (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>) would have liked it better--that she (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>) never
pretended to deny. But there they were. The air wasn't bad, after all;
the people were very good sort of people--civil to you if you were civil
to them, after the first brush; and they didn't expect to work miracles,
and convert them all off-hand into model Christians. So he (<font color='blue'><b>husband</b></font>) and she (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>) went
quietly among the folk, talking to and treating them just as they would
have done people of their own rank. They didn't feel that they were
doing anything out of the common way, and so were perfectly natural,
and had none of that condescension or consciousness of manner which so
outrages the independent poor. And thus they gradually won respect and
confidence; and after sixteen years he (<font color='blue'><b>husband</b></font>) was looked up to by the whole
neighbourhood as the just man, the man to whom masters and men could
go in their strikes, and in all their quarrels and difficulties, and by
whom the right and true word would be said without fear or favour. And
the women had come round to take her (<font color='blue'><b>women</b></font>) advice, and go to her (<font color='blue'><b>women</b></font>) as a friend
in all their troubles; while the children all worshipped the very ground
she (<font color='blue'><b>women</b></font>) trod on.

<p/>They had three children, two daughters and a son, little Arthur, who
came between his (<font color='blue'><b>Arthur</b></font>) sisters. He (<font color='blue'><b>Arthur</b></font>) had been a very delicate boy from his (<font color='blue'><b>Arthur</b></font>)
childhood; they thought he (<font color='blue'><b>Arthur</b></font>) had a tendency to consumption, and so he (<font color='blue'><b>Arthur</b></font>) had
been kept at home and taught by his (<font color='blue'><b>Arthur</b></font>) father, who had made a companion of
him (<font color='blue'><b>Arthur</b></font>), and from whom he (<font color='blue'><b>Arthur</b></font>) had gained good scholarship, and a knowledge of
and interest in many subjects which boys in general never come across
till they are many years older.

<p/>Just as he (<font color='blue'><b>Arthur</b></font>) reached his (<font color='blue'><b>Arthur</b></font>) thirteenth year, and his (<font color='blue'><b>Arthur</b></font>) father had settled that
he (<font color='blue'><b>Arthur</b></font>) was strong enough to go to school, and, after much debating with
himself, had resolved to send him (<font color='blue'><b>Arthur</b></font>) there, a desperate typhus fever broke
out in the town. Most of the other clergy, and almost all the doctors,
ran away; the work fell with tenfold weight on those who stood to their
work. Arthur and his (<font color='blue'><b>Arthur</b></font>) wife both caught the fever, of which he (<font color='blue'><b>Arthur</b></font>) died in a
few days; and she (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>) recovered, having been able to nurse him (<font color='blue'><b>Arthur</b></font>) to the end,
and store up his (<font color='blue'><b>Arthur</b></font>) last words. He (<font color='blue'><b>Arthur</b></font>) was sensible to the last, and calm and
happy, leaving his (<font color='blue'><b>Arthur</b></font>) wife and children with fearless trust for a few years
in the hands of the Lord and Friend who had lived and died for him (<font color='blue'><b>Lord</b></font>), and
for whom he (<font color='blue'><b>Lord</b></font>), to the best of his (<font color='blue'><b>Lord</b></font>) power, had lived and died. His (<font color='blue'><b>Lord</b></font>) widow's
mourning was deep and gentle. She (<font color='blue'><b>widow</b></font>) was more affected by the request of
the committee of a freethinking club, established in the town by some of
the factory hands -LRB-which he (<font color='blue'><b>Lord</b></font>) had striven against with might and main, and
nearly suppressed-RRB-, that some of their number might be allowed to help
bear the coffin, than by anything else. Two of them were chosen, who,
with six other labouring men, his (<font color='blue'><b>Lord</b></font>) own fellow-workmen and friends, bore
him (<font color='blue'><b>Lord</b></font>) to his (<font color='blue'><b>Lord</b></font>) grave--a man who had fought the Lord's fight even unto the
death. The shops were closed and the factories shut that day in the
parish, yet no master stopped the day's wages; but for many a year
afterwards the townsfolk felt the want of that brave, hopeful, loving
parson and his (<font color='blue'><b>parson</b></font>) wife, who had lived to teach them mutual forbearance and
helpfulness, and had almost at last given them a glimpse of what this
old world would be if people would live for God and each other instead
of for themselves.

<p/>What has all this to do with our story? Well, my dear boys, let a fellow
go on his (<font color='blue'><b>God</b></font>) own way, or you won't get anything out of him (<font color='blue'><b>God</b></font>) worth having.
I must show you what sort of a man it was who had begotten and trained
little Arthur, or else you won't believe in him (<font color='blue'><b>Arthur</b></font>), which I am resolved you
shall do; and you won't see how he (<font color='blue'><b>Arthur</b></font>), the timid, weak boy, had points in
him (<font color='blue'><b>Arthur</b></font>) from which the bravest and strongest recoiled, and made his (<font color='blue'><b>Arthur</b></font>) presence
and example felt from the first on all sides, unconsciously to himself,
and without the least attempt at proselytizing. The spirit of his (<font color='blue'><b>Arthur</b></font>) father
was in him (<font color='blue'><b>Arthur</b></font>), and the Friend to whom his (<font color='blue'><b>Friend</b></font>) father had left him (<font color='blue'><b>Friend</b></font>) did not
neglect the trust.

<p/>After supper that night, and almost nightly for years afterwards,
Tom and Arthur, and by degrees East occasionally, and sometimes one,
sometimes another, of their friends, read a chapter of the Bible
together, and talked it over afterwards. Tom was at first utterly
astonished, and almost shocked, at the sort of way in which Arthur read
the book and talked about the men and women whose lives were there told.
The first night they happened to fall on the chapters about the famine
in Egypt, and Arthur began talking about Joseph as if he (<font color='blue'><b>Arthur</b></font>) were a living
statesman--just as he (<font color='blue'><b>Arthur</b></font>) might have talked about Lord Grey and the Reform
Bill, only that they were much more living realities to him (<font color='blue'><b>Bill</b></font>). The book
was to him (<font color='blue'><b>Bill</b></font>), Tom saw, the most vivid and delightful history of real
people, who might do right or wrong, just like any one who was walking
about in Rugby--the Doctor, or the masters, or the sixth-form boys. But
the astonishment soon passed off, the scales seemed to drop from his (<font color='blue'><b>Doctor</b></font>)
eyes, and the book became at once and for ever to him (<font color='blue'><b>Doctor</b></font>) the great human
and divine book, and the men and women, whom he (<font color='blue'><b>Doctor</b></font>) had looked upon
as something quite different from himself, became his (<font color='blue'><b>Doctor</b></font>) friends and
counsellors.

<p/>For our purposes, however, the history of one night's reading will be
sufficient, which must be told here, now we are on the subject, though
it didn't happen till a year afterwards, and long after the events
recorded in the next chapter of our story.

<p/>Arthur, Tom, and East were together one night, and read the story of
Naaman coming to Elisha to be cured of his (<font color='blue'><b>Elisha</b></font>) leprosy. When the chapter was
finished, Tom shut his (<font color='blue'><b>Tom</b></font>) Bible with a slap.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``I can't stand that fellow Naaman,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>said he (<font color='blue'><b>Tom</b></font>), <div class="bookquote">``after what he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>)'d seen and
felt, going back and bowing himself down in the house of Rimmon, because
his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) effeminate scoundrel of a master did it. I wonder Elisha took the
trouble to heal him (<font color='blue'><b>Elisha</b></font>). How he (<font color='blue'><b>Elisha</b></font>) must have despised him (<font color='blue'><b>Elisha</b></font>)!''

 (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Yes; there you go off as usual, with a shell on your head,''  (<font color='red'><b>Tom/Brown/Tom Brown</b></font>)</div>struck
in East, who always took the opposite side to Tom, half from love of
argument, half from conviction. <div class="bookquote">``How do you know he (<font color='blue'><b>Elisha</b></font>) didn't think better
of it? How do you know his (<font color='blue'><b>Elisha</b></font>) master was a scoundrel? His (<font color='blue'><b>Elisha</b></font>) letter don't look
like it, and the book don't say so.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I don't care,''  (<font color='red'><b>Tom/Brown/Tom Brown</b></font>)</div>rejoined Tom; <div class="bookquote">``why did Naaman talk about bowing down,
then, if he (<font color='blue'><b>Elisha</b></font>) didn't mean to do it? He (<font color='blue'><b>Elisha</b></font>) wasn't likely to get more in
earnest when he (<font color='blue'><b>Elisha</b></font>) got back to court, and away from the prophet.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Tom/Brown/Tom Brown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Well, but, Tom,''  (<font color='red'><b>Arthur/George/George Arthur</b></font>)</div>said Arthur, <div class="bookquote">``look what Elisha says to him (<font color='blue'><b>Elisha</b></font>)--`Go in
peace.' He (<font color='blue'><b>Tom</b></font>) wouldn't have said that if Naaman had been in the wrong.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Arthur/George/George Arthur</b></font>)</div><p/>``I don't see that that means more than saying, `You're not the man I
took you for.'''

<p/><div class="bookquote">``No, no; that won't do at all,''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>said East. <div class="bookquote">``Read the words fairly, and
take men as you find them. I like Naaman, and think he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) was a very fine
fellow.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I don't,''  (<font color='red'><b>Tom/Brown/Tom Brown</b></font>)</div>said Tom positively.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Well, I think East is right,''  (<font color='red'><b>Arthur/George/George Arthur</b></font>)</div>said Arthur; <div class="bookquote">``I can't see but what it's
right to do the best you can, though it mayn't be the best absolutely.
Every man isn't born to be a martyr.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Arthur/George/George Arthur</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Of course, of course,''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>said East; <div class="bookquote">``but he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>)'s on one of his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) pet
hobbies.--How often have I told you, Tom, that you must drive a nail
where it'll go.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``And how often have I told you,''  (<font color='red'><b>Tom/Brown/Tom Brown</b></font>)</div>rejoined Tom, <div class="bookquote">``that it'll always go
where you want, if you only stick to it and hit hard enough. I hate
half-measures and compromises.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Tom/Brown/Tom Brown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Yes, he (<font color='blue'><b>Tom</b></font>)'s a whole-hog man, is Tom. Must have the whole animal-hair and
teeth, claws and tail,''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>laughed East. <div class="bookquote">``Sooner have no bread any day than
half the loaf.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I don't know;''  (<font color='red'><b>Arthur/George/George Arthur</b></font>)</div>said Arthur--<div class="bookquote">``it's rather puzzling; but ain't most right
things got by proper compromises--I mean where the principle isn't given
up?''

 (<font color='red'><b>Arthur/George/George Arthur</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``That's just the point,''  (<font color='red'><b>Tom/Brown/Tom Brown</b></font>)</div>said Tom; <div class="bookquote">``I don't object to a compromise,
where you don't give up your principle.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Tom/Brown/Tom Brown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Not you,''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>said East laughingly.--<div class="bookquote">``I know him (<font color='blue'><b>Tom</b></font>) of old, Arthur, and you'll
find him (<font color='blue'><b>Arthur</b></font>) out some day. There isn't such a reasonable fellow in the
world, to hear him (<font color='blue'><b>fellow</b></font>) talk. He (<font color='blue'><b>fellow</b></font>) never wants anything but what's right
and fair; only when you come to settle what's right and fair, it's
everything that he (<font color='blue'><b>fellow</b></font>) wants, and nothing that you want. And that's his (<font color='blue'><b>fellow</b></font>) idea
of a compromise. Give me the Brown compromise when I'm on his (<font color='blue'><b>fellow</b></font>) side.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Now, Harry,''  (<font color='red'><b>Tom/Brown/Tom Brown</b></font>)</div>said Tom, <div class="bookquote">``no more chaff. I'm serious. Look here. This is
what makes my blood tingle.''  (<font color='red'><b>Tom/Brown/Tom Brown</b></font>)</div>And he (<font color='blue'><b>Tom</b></font>) turned over the pages of his (<font color='blue'><b>Tom</b></font>) Bible
and read, <div class="bookquote">``Shadrach, Meshach, and Abed-nego answered and said to the
king, O Nebuchadnezzar, we are not careful to answer thee in this
matter. If it be so, our God whom we serve is able to deliver us from
the burning fiery furnace, and he (<font color='blue'><b>God</b></font>) will deliver us out of thine hand, O
king. But if not, be it known unto thee, O king, that we will not serve
thy gods, nor worship the golden image which thou hast set up.''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>He (<font color='blue'><b>Tom</b></font>) read
the last verse twice, emphasizing the nots, and dwelling on them as if
they gave him (<font color='blue'><b>Tom</b></font>) actual pleasure, and were hard to part with.

<p/>They were silent a minute, and then Arthur said, <div class="bookquote">``Yes, that's a glorious
story, but it don't prove your point, Tom, I think. There are times when
there is only one way, and that the highest, and then the men are found
to stand in the breach.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Arthur/George/George Arthur</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``There's always a highest way, and it's always the right one,''  (<font color='red'><b>Tom/Brown/Tom Brown</b></font>)</div>said Tom.
<div class="bookquote">``How many times has the Doctor told us that in his (<font color='blue'><b>Doctor</b></font>) sermons in the last
year, I should like to know?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Well, you ain't going to convince us--is he (<font color='blue'><b>Doctor</b></font>), Arthur? No Brown
compromise to-night,''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>said East, looking at his (<font color='blue'><b>Tom</b></font>) watch. <div class="bookquote">``But it's past
eight, and we must go to first lesson. What a bore!''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/>So they took down their books and fell to work; but Arthur didn't
forget, and thought long and often over the conversation.



<p/>CHAPTER III--ARTHUR MAKES A FRIEND.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Let Nature be your teacher:
Sweet is the lore which Nature brings.
Our meddling intellect
Misshapes the beauteous forms of things.
We murder to dissect.
Enough of Science and of Art:
Close up those barren leaves;
Come forth, and bring with you a heart
That watches and receives.'' (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>--WORDSWORTH.

<p/>About six weeks after the beginning of the half, as Tom and Arthur were
sitting one night before supper beginning their verses, Arthur suddenly
stopped, and looked up, and said, <div class="bookquote">``Tom, do you know anything of Martin?''

 (<font color='red'><b>Arthur/George/George Arthur</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Yes,''  (<font color='red'><b>Tom/Brown/Tom Brown</b></font>)</div>said Tom, taking his (<font color='blue'><b>Tom</b></font>) hand out of his (<font color='blue'><b>Tom</b></font>) back hair, and delighted to
throw his (<font color='blue'><b>Tom</b></font>) Gradus ad Parnassum on to the sofa; <div class="bookquote">``I know him (<font color='blue'><b>Tom</b></font>) pretty well.
He (<font color='blue'><b>Tom</b></font>)'s a very good fellow, but as mad as a hatter. He (<font color='blue'><b>Tom</b></font>)'s called Madman, you
know. And never was such a fellow for getting all sorts of rum things
about him (<font color='blue'><b>fellow</b></font>). He (<font color='blue'><b>fellow</b></font>) tamed two snakes last half, and used to carry them about
in his (<font color='blue'><b>fellow</b></font>) pocket; and I'll be bound he (<font color='blue'><b>fellow</b></font>)'s got some hedgehogs and rats in his (<font color='blue'><b>fellow</b></font>)
cupboard now, and no one knows what besides.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Gradus</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I should like very much to know him (<font color='blue'><b>fellow</b></font>),''  (<font color='red'><b>Arthur/George/George Arthur</b></font>)</div>said Arthur; <div class="bookquote">``he (<font color='blue'><b>fellow</b></font>) was next to me
in the form to-day, and he (<font color='blue'><b>fellow</b></font>)'d lost his (<font color='blue'><b>fellow</b></font>) book and looked over mine, and he (<font color='blue'><b>fellow</b></font>)
seemed so kind and gentle that I liked him (<font color='blue'><b>fellow</b></font>) very much.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Arthur/George/George Arthur</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Ah, poor old Madman, he (<font color='blue'><b>fellow</b></font>)'s always losing his (<font color='blue'><b>fellow</b></font>) books,''  (<font color='red'><b>Tom/Brown/Tom Brown</b></font>)</div>said Tom, <div class="bookquote">``and
getting called up and floored because he (<font color='blue'><b>fellow</b></font>) hasn't got them.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Tom/Brown/Tom Brown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I like him (<font color='blue'><b>fellow</b></font>) all the better,''  (<font color='red'><b>Arthur/George/George Arthur</b></font>)</div>said Arthur.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Well, he (<font color='blue'><b>fellow</b></font>)'s great fun, I can tell you,''  (<font color='red'><b>Tom/Brown/Tom Brown</b></font>)</div>said Tom, throwing himself back
on the sofa, and chuckling at the remembrance. ``We had such a game with
him (<font color='blue'><b>fellow</b></font>) one day last half. He (<font color='blue'><b>fellow</b></font>) had been kicking up horrid stinks for some
time in his (<font color='blue'><b>fellow</b></font>) study, till I suppose some fellow told Mary, and she (<font color='blue'><b>Mary</b></font>) told
the Doctor. Anyhow, one day a little before dinner, when he (<font color='blue'><b>Doctor</b></font>) came down
from the library, the Doctor, instead of going home, came striding into
the hall. East and I and five or six other fellows were at the fire, and
preciously we stared, for he (<font color='blue'><b>Doctor</b></font>) don't come in like that once a year, unless
it is a wet day and there's a fight in the hall. `East,' says he (<font color='blue'><b>Doctor</b></font>), `just
come and show me Martin's study.' `Oh, here's a game,' whispered the
rest of us; and we all cut upstairs after the Doctor, East leading. As
we got into the New Row, which was hardly wide enough to hold the Doctor
and his (<font color='blue'><b>Doctor</b></font>) gown, click, click, click, we heard in the old Madman's den.
Then that stopped all of a sudden, and the bolts went to like fun. The
Madman knew East's step, and thought there was going to be a siege.

<p/>```It's the Doctor, Martin. He (<font color='blue'><b>Martin</b></font>)'s here and wants to see you,' sings out
East.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Then the bolts went back slowly, and the door opened, and there was
the old Madman standing, looking precious scared--his (<font color='blue'><b>Martin</b></font>) jacket off, his (<font color='blue'><b>Martin</b></font>)
shirt-sleeves up to his (<font color='blue'><b>Martin</b></font>) elbows, and his (<font color='blue'><b>Martin</b></font>) long skinny arms all covered
with anchors and arrows and letters, tattooed in with gunpowder like a
sailor-boy's, and a stink fit to knock you down coming out. `Twas
all the Doctor could do to stand his (<font color='blue'><b>Doctor</b></font>) ground, and East and I, who were
looking in under his (<font color='blue'><b>Doctor</b></font>) arms, held our noses tight. The old magpie was
standing on the window-sill, all his (<font color='blue'><b>Doctor</b></font>) feathers drooping, and looking
disgusted and half-poisoned.

<p/>```What can you be about, Martin?' says the Doctor. `You really mustn't
go on in this way; you're a nuisance to the whole passage.'

<p/>```Please, sir, I was only mixing up this powder; there isn't any harm
in it. And the Madman seized nervously on his (<font color='blue'><b>Doctor</b></font>) pestle and mortar, to
show the Doctor the harmlessness of his (<font color='blue'><b>Doctor</b></font>) pursuits, and went on
pounding--click, click, click. He (<font color='blue'><b>Doctor</b></font>) hadn't given six clicks before, puff!
up went the whole into a great blaze, away went the pestle and mortar
across the study, and back we tumbled into the passage. The magpie
fluttered down into the court, swearing, and the Madman danced out,
howling, with his (<font color='blue'><b>Doctor</b></font>) fingers in his (<font color='blue'><b>Doctor</b></font>) mouth. The Doctor caught hold of him (<font color='blue'><b>Doctor</b></font>),
and called to us to fetch some water. `There, you silly fellow,' said
he (<font color='blue'><b>fellow</b></font>), quite pleased, though, to find he (<font color='blue'><b>fellow</b></font>) wasn't much hurt, `you see you
don't know the least what you're doing with all these things; and now,
mind, you must give up practising chemistry by yourself.' Then he (<font color='blue'><b>fellow</b></font>) took
hold of his (<font color='blue'><b>fellow</b></font>) arm and looked at it, and I saw he (<font color='blue'><b>fellow</b></font>) had to bite his (<font color='blue'><b>fellow</b></font>) lip, and
his (<font color='blue'><b>fellow</b></font>) eyes twinkled; but he (<font color='blue'><b>fellow</b></font>) said, quite grave, `Here, you see, you've been
making all these foolish marks on yourself, which you can never get out,
and you'll be very sorry for it in a year or two. Now come down to the
housekeeper's room, and let us see if you are hurt.' And away went
the two, and we all stayed and had a regular turn-out of the den, till
Martin came back with his (<font color='blue'><b>Martin</b></font>) hand bandaged and turned us out. However, I'll
go and see what he (<font color='blue'><b>Martin</b></font>)'s after, and tell him (<font color='blue'><b>Martin</b></font>) to come in after prayers to
supper.''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>And away went Tom to find the boy in question, who dwelt in a
little study by himself, in New Row.

<p/>The aforesaid Martin, whom Arthur had taken such a fancy for, was one of
those unfortunates who were at that time of day -LRB-and are, I fear, still-RRB-
quite out of their places at a public school. If we knew how to use
our boys, Martin would have been seized upon and educated as a natural
philosopher. He (<font color='blue'><b>Martin</b></font>) had a passion for birds, beasts, and insects, and knew
more of them and their habits than any one in Rugby--except perhaps the
Doctor, who knew everything. He (<font color='blue'><b>Doctor</b></font>) was also an experimental chemist on a
small scale, and had made unto himself an electric machine, from which
it was his (<font color='blue'><b>Doctor</b></font>) greatest pleasure and glory to administer small shocks to any
small boys who were rash enough to venture into his (<font color='blue'><b>Doctor</b></font>) study. And this
was by no means an adventure free from excitement; for besides the
probability of a snake dropping on to your head or twining lovingly up
your leg, or a rat getting into your breeches-pocket in search of food,
there was the animal and chemical odour to be faced, which always hung
about the den, and the chance of being blown up in some of the many
experiments which Martin was always trying, with the most wondrous
results in the shape of explosions and smells that mortal boy ever heard
of. Of course, poor Martin, in consequence of his (<font color='blue'><b>Martin</b></font>) pursuits, had become
an Ishmaelite in the house. In the first place, he (<font color='blue'><b>Martin</b></font>) half-poisoned all his (<font color='blue'><b>Martin</b></font>)
neighbours, and they in turn were always on the lookout to pounce upon
any of his (<font color='blue'><b>Martin</b></font>) numerous live-stock, and drive him (<font color='blue'><b>Martin</b></font>) frantic by enticing his (<font color='blue'><b>Martin</b></font>)
pet old magpie out of his (<font color='blue'><b>Martin</b></font>) window into a neighbouring study, and making
the disreputable old bird drunk on toast soaked in beer and sugar. Then
Martin, for his (<font color='blue'><b>Martin</b></font>) sins, inhabited a study looking into a small court some
ten feet across, the window of which was completely commanded by those
of the studies opposite in the Sick-room Row, these latter being at
a slightly higher elevation. East, and another boy of an equally
tormenting and ingenious turn of mind, now lived exactly opposite, and
had expended huge pains and time in the preparation of instruments of
annoyance for the behoof of Martin and his (<font color='blue'><b>Martin</b></font>) live colony. One morning
an old basket made its appearance, suspended by a short cord outside
Martin's window, in which were deposited an amateur nest containing four
young hungry jackdaws, the pride and glory of Martin's life, for the
time being, and which he (<font color='blue'><b>Martin</b></font>) was currently asserted to have hatched upon
his (<font color='blue'><b>Martin</b></font>) own person. Early in the morning and late at night he (<font color='blue'><b>Martin</b></font>) was to be
seen half out of window, administering to the varied wants of his (<font color='blue'><b>Martin</b></font>) callow
brood. After deep cogitation, East and his (<font color='blue'><b>Martin</b></font>) chum had spliced a knife on
to the end of a fishing-rod; and having watched Martin out, had, after
half an hour's severe sawing, cut the string by which the basket
was suspended, and tumbled it on to the pavement below, with hideous
remonstrance from the occupants. Poor Martin, returning from his (<font color='blue'><b>Martin</b></font>) short
absence, collected the fragments and replaced his (<font color='blue'><b>Martin</b></font>) brood -LRB-except one
whose neck had been broken in the descent-RRB- in their old location,
suspending them this time by string and wire twisted together, defiant
of any sharp instrument which his (<font color='blue'><b>Martin</b></font>) persecutors could command. But, like
the Russian engineers at Sebastopol, East and his (<font color='blue'><b>Martin</b></font>) chum had an answer for
every move of the adversary, and the next day had mounted a gun in the
shape of a pea-shooter upon the ledge of their window, trained so as to
bear exactly upon the spot which Martin had to occupy while tending his (<font color='blue'><b>Martin</b></font>)
nurslings. The moment he (<font color='blue'><b>Martin</b></font>) began to feed they began to shoot. In vain did
the enemy himself invest in a pea-shooter, and endeavour to answer the
fire while he (<font color='blue'><b>Martin</b></font>) fed the young birds with his (<font color='blue'><b>Martin</b></font>) other hand; his (<font color='blue'><b>Martin</b></font>) attention was
divided, and his (<font color='blue'><b>Martin</b></font>) shots flew wild, while every one of theirs told on his (<font color='blue'><b>Martin</b></font>)
face and hands, and drove him (<font color='blue'><b>Martin</b></font>) into howlings and imprecations. He (<font color='blue'><b>Martin</b></font>)
had been driven to ensconce the nest in a corner of his (<font color='blue'><b>Martin</b></font>) already
too-well-filled den.

<p/>His (<font color='blue'><b>Martin</b></font>) door was barricaded by a set of ingenious bolts of his (<font color='blue'><b>Martin</b></font>) own
invention, for the sieges were frequent by the neighbours when any
unusually ambrosial odour spread itself from the den to the neighbouring
studies. The door panels were in a normal state of smash, but the frame
of the door resisted all besiegers, and behind it the owner carried on
his (<font color='blue'><b>owner</b></font>) varied pursuits--much in the same state of mind, I should fancy,
as a border-farmer lived in, in the days of the moss-troopers, when his (<font color='blue'><b>owner</b></font>)
hold might be summoned or his (<font color='blue'><b>owner</b></font>) cattle carried off at any minute of night
or day.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Open, Martin, old boy; it's only I, Tom Brown.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Oh, very well; stop a moment.''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>One bolt went back. <div class="bookquote">``You're sure East
isn't there?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``No, no; hang it, open.''  (<font color='red'><b>Tom/Brown/Tom Brown</b></font>)</div>Tom gave a kick, the other bolt creaked, and he (<font color='blue'><b>Tom</b></font>)
entered the den.

<p/>Den indeed it was--about five feet six inches long by five wide, and
seven feet high. About six tattered school-books, and a few chemical
books, Taxidermy, Stanley on Birds, and an odd volume of Bewick, the
latter in much better preservation, occupied the top shelves. The other
shelves, where they had not been cut away and used by the owner for
other purposes, were fitted up for the abiding-places of birds, beasts,
and reptiles. There was no attempt at carpet or curtain. The table was
entirely occupied by the great work of Martin, the electric machine,
which was covered carefully with the remains of his (<font color='blue'><b>Martin</b></font>) table-cloth. The
jackdaw cage occupied one wall; and the other was adorned by a small
hatchet, a pair of climbing irons, and his (<font color='blue'><b>Martin</b></font>) tin candle-box, in which he (<font color='blue'><b>Martin</b></font>)
was for the time being endeavouring to raise a hopeful young family of
field-mice. As nothing should be let to lie useless, it was well that
the candle-box was thus occupied, for candles Martin never had. A pound
was issued to him (<font color='blue'><b>Martin</b></font>) weekly, as to the other boys; but as candles were
available capital, and easily exchangeable for birds' eggs or young
birds, Martin's pound invariably found its way in a few hours to
Howlett's the bird-fancier's, in the Bilton road, who would give a
hawk's or nightingale's egg or young linnet in exchange. Martin's
ingenuity was therefore for ever on the rack to supply himself with
a light. Just now he (<font color='blue'><b>Martin</b></font>) had hit upon a grand invention, and the den was
lighted by a flaring cotton wick issuing from a ginger-beer bottle full
of some doleful composition. When light altogether failed him (<font color='blue'><b>Martin</b></font>), Martin
would loaf about by the fires in the passages or hall, after the manner
of Diggs, and try to do his (<font color='blue'><b>Diggs</b></font>) verses or learn his (<font color='blue'><b>Diggs</b></font>) lines by the firelight.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Well, old boy, you haven't got any sweeter in the den this half. How
that stuff in the bottle stinks! Never mind; I ain't going to stop; but
you come up after prayers to our study. You know young Arthur. We've got
Gray's study. We'll have a good supper and talk about bird-nesting.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Martin</b></font>)</div><p/>Martin was evidently highly pleased at the invitation, and promised to
be up without fail.

<p/>As soon as prayers were over, and the sixth and fifth form boys had
withdrawn to the aristocratic seclusion of their own room, and the rest,
or democracy, had sat down to their supper in the hall, Tom and Arthur,
having secured their allowances of bread and cheese, started on their
feet to catch the eye of the praepostor of the week, who remained in
charge during supper, walking up and down the hall. He (<font color='blue'><b>Arthur</b></font>) happened to be an
easy-going fellow, so they got a pleasant nod to their <div class="bookquote">``Please may I go
out?''  (<font color='red'><b>an fellow</b></font>)</div>and away they scrambled to prepare for Martin a sumptuous banquet.
This Tom had insisted on, for he (<font color='blue'><b>Martin</b></font>) was in great delight on the occasion,
the reason of which delight must be expounded. The fact was that this
was the first attempt at a friendship of his (<font color='blue'><b>Martin</b></font>) own which Arthur had made,
and Tom hailed it as a grand step. The ease with which he (<font color='blue'><b>Tom</b></font>) himself became
hail-fellow-well-met with anybody, and blundered into and out of twenty
friendships a half-year, made him (<font color='blue'><b>Tom</b></font>) sometimes sorry and sometimes angry at
Arthur's reserve and loneliness. True, Arthur was always pleasant, and
even jolly, with any boys who came with Tom to their study; but Tom felt
that it was only through him (<font color='blue'><b>Tom</b></font>), as it were, that his (<font color='blue'><b>Tom</b></font>) chum associated
with others, and that but for him (<font color='blue'><b>Tom</b></font>) Arthur would have been dwelling in
a wilderness. This increased his (<font color='blue'><b>Arthur</b></font>) consciousness of responsibility;
and though he (<font color='blue'><b>Arthur</b></font>) hadn't reasoned it out and made it clear to himself yet
somehow he (<font color='blue'><b>Arthur</b></font>) knew that this responsibility, this trust which he (<font color='blue'><b>Arthur</b></font>) had taken
on him (<font color='blue'><b>Arthur</b></font>) without thinking about it, head over heels in fact, was the
centre and turning-point of his (<font color='blue'><b>Arthur</b></font>) school-life, that which was to make him (<font color='blue'><b>Arthur</b></font>)
or mar him (<font color='blue'><b>Arthur</b></font>), his (<font color='blue'><b>Arthur</b></font>) appointed work and trial for the time being. And Tom
was becoming a new boy, though with frequent tumbles in the dirt and
perpetual hard battle with himself, and was daily growing in manfulness
and thoughtfulness, as every high-couraged and well-principled boy must,
when he (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>) finds himself for the first time consciously at grips with self
and the devil. Already he (<font color='blue'><b>devil</b></font>) could turn almost without a sigh from the
School-gates, from which had just scampered off East and three or four
others of his (<font color='blue'><b>devil</b></font>) own particular set, bound for some jolly lark not quite
according to law, and involving probably a row with louts, keepers,
or farm-labourers, the skipping dinner or calling-over, some of Phoebe
Jennings's beer, and a very possible flogging at the end of all as a
relish. He (<font color='blue'><b>Jennings</b></font>) had quite got over the stage in which he (<font color='blue'><b>Jennings</b></font>) would grumble to
himself--<div class="bookquote">``Well, hang it, it's very hard of the Doctor to have saddled me
with Arthur. Why couldn't he (<font color='blue'><b>Arthur</b></font>) have chummed him (<font color='blue'><b>Arthur</b></font>) with Fogey, or Thomkin, or
any of the fellows who never do anything but walk round the close, and
finish their copies the first day they're set?''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>But although all this
was past, he (<font color='blue'><b>Jennings</b></font>) longed, and felt that he (<font color='blue'><b>Jennings</b></font>) was right in longing, for more
time for the legitimate pastimes of cricket, fives, bathing, and
fishing, within bounds, in which Arthur could not yet be his (<font color='blue'><b>Arthur</b></font>) companion;
and he (<font color='blue'><b>Arthur</b></font>) felt that when the <div class="bookquote">``young un''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>-LRB-as he (<font color='blue'><b>Arthur</b></font>) now generally called him (<font color='blue'><b>Arthur</b></font>)-RRB-
had found a pursuit and some other friend for himself, he (<font color='blue'><b>friend</b></font>) should be
able to give more time to the education of his (<font color='blue'><b>friend</b></font>) own body with a clear
conscience.

<p/>And now what he (<font color='blue'><b>friend</b></font>) so wished for had come to pass; he (<font color='blue'><b>friend</b></font>) almost hailed it as
a special providence -LRB-as indeed it was, but not for the reasons he (<font color='blue'><b>friend</b></font>)
gave for it--what providences are?-RRB- that Arthur should have singled out
Martin of all fellows for a friend. <div class="bookquote">``The old Madman is the very fellow,''
 (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>thought he (<font color='blue'><b>Arthur</b></font>); <div class="bookquote">``he (<font color='blue'><b>Arthur</b></font>) will take him (<font color='blue'><b>Arthur</b></font>) scrambling over half the country after
birds' eggs and flowers, make him (<font color='blue'><b>Arthur</b></font>) run and swim and climb like an Indian,
and not teach him (<font color='blue'><b>Arthur</b></font>) a word of anything bad, or keep him (<font color='blue'><b>Arthur</b></font>) from his (<font color='blue'><b>Arthur</b></font>) lessons.
What luck!''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>And so, with more than his (<font color='blue'><b>Arthur</b></font>) usual heartiness, he (<font color='blue'><b>Arthur</b></font>) dived into
his (<font color='blue'><b>Arthur</b></font>) cupboard, and hauled out an old knuckle-bone of ham, and two or
three bottles of beer, together with the solemn pewter only used on
state occasions; while Arthur, equally elated at the easy accomplishment
of his (<font color='blue'><b>Arthur</b></font>) first act of volition in the joint establishment, produced from
his (<font color='blue'><b>Arthur</b></font>) side a bottle of pickles and a pot of jam, and cleared the table. In
a minute or two the noise of the boys coming up from supper was heard,
and Martin knocked and was admitted, bearing his (<font color='blue'><b>Martin</b></font>) bread and cheese; and
the three fell to with hearty good-will upon the viands, talking faster
than they ate, for all shyness disappeared in a moment before Tom's
bottled-beer and hospitable ways. <div class="bookquote">``Here's Arthur, a regular young
town-mouse, with a natural taste for the woods, Martin, longing to break
his (<font color='blue'><b>Martin</b></font>) neck climbing trees, and with a passion for young snakes.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Well, I say,''  (<font color='red'><b>Martin</b></font>)</div>sputtered out Martin eagerly, <div class="bookquote">``will you come to-morrow,
both of you, to Caldecott's Spinney then? for I know of a kestrel's
nest, up a fir-tree. I can't get at it without help; and, Brown, you can
climb against any one.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Martin</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Oh yes, do let us go,''  (<font color='red'><b>Arthur/George/George Arthur</b></font>)</div>said Arthur; <div class="bookquote">``I never saw a hawk's nest nor a
hawk's egg.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Arthur/George/George Arthur</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``You just come down to my study, then, and I'll show you five sorts,''
 (<font color='red'><b>Martin</b></font>)</div>said Martin.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Ay, the old Madman has got the best collection in the house, out and
out,''  (<font color='red'><b>Tom/Brown/Tom Brown</b></font>)</div>said Tom; and then Martin, warming with unaccustomed good cheer
and the chance of a convert, launched out into a proposed bird-nesting
campaign, betraying all manner of important secrets--a golden-crested
wren's nest near Butlin's Mound, a moor-hen who was sitting on nine eggs
in a pond down the Barby road, and a kingfisher's nest in a corner of
the old canal above Brownsover Mill. He (<font color='blue'><b>wren</b></font>) had heard, he (<font color='blue'><b>wren</b></font>) said, that no
one had ever got a kingfisher's nest out perfect, and that the British
Museum, or the Government, or somebody, had offered 100 pounds to any
one who could bring them a nest and eggs not damaged. In the middle of
which astounding announcement, to which the others were listening with
open ears, and already considering the application of the 100 pounds, a
knock came to the door, and East's voice was heard craving admittance.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``There's Harry,''  (<font color='red'><b>Tom/Brown/Tom Brown</b></font>)</div>said Tom; <div class="bookquote">``we'll let him (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) in. I'll keep him (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) steady,
Martin. I thought the old boy would smell out the supper.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Tom/Brown/Tom Brown</b></font>)</div><p/>The fact was, that Tom's heart had already smitten him (<font color='blue'><b>Tom</b></font>) for not asking
his (<font color='blue'><b>Tom</b></font>) fidus Achates to the feast, although only an extempore affair; and
though prudence and the desire to get Martin and Arthur together alone
at first had overcome his (<font color='blue'><b>Martin</b></font>) scruples, he (<font color='blue'><b>Martin</b></font>) was now heartily glad to open the
door, broach another bottle of beer, and hand over the old ham-knuckle
to the searching of his (<font color='blue'><b>Martin</b></font>) old friend's pocket-knife.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Ah, you greedy vagabonds,''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>said East, with his (<font color='blue'><b>Martin</b></font>) mouth full, <div class="bookquote">``I knew
there was something going on when I saw you cut off out of hall so
quick with your suppers. What a stunning tap, Tom! You are a wunner for
bottling the swipes.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I've had practice enough for the sixth in my time, and it's hard if I
haven't picked up a wrinkle or two for my own benefit.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Well, old Madman, and how goes the bird-nesting campaign? How's
Howlett? I expect the young rooks'll be out in another fortnight, and
then my turn comes.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``There'll be no young rooks fit for pies for a month yet; shows how much
you know about it,''  (<font color='red'><b>Martin</b></font>)</div>rejoined Martin, who, though very good friends with
East, regarded him (<font color='blue'><b>Martin</b></font>) with considerable suspicion for his (<font color='blue'><b>Martin</b></font>) propensity to
practical jokes.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Scud knows nothing and cares for nothing but grub and mischief,''  (<font color='red'><b>Tom/Brown/Tom Brown</b></font>)</div>said
Tom; <div class="bookquote">``but young rook pie, specially when you've had to climb for them,
is very pretty eating.--However, I say, Scud, we're all going after a
hawk's nest to-morrow, in Caldecott's Spinney; and if you'll come and
behave yourself, we'll have a stunning climb.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Tom/Brown/Tom Brown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``And a bathe in Aganippe. Hooray! I'm your man.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``No, no; no bathing in Aganippe; that's where our betters go.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Well, well, never mind. I'm for the hawk's nest, and anything that
turns up.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/>And the bottled-beer being finished, and his (<font color='blue'><b>Tom</b></font>) hunger appeased, East
departed to his (<font color='blue'><b>Tom</b></font>) study, <div class="bookquote">``that sneak Jones,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>as he (<font color='blue'><b>Tom</b></font>) informed them, who had
just got into the sixth, and occupied the next study, having instituted
a nightly visitation upon East and his (<font color='blue'><b>Tom</b></font>) chum, to their no small
discomfort.

<p/>When he (<font color='blue'><b>Tom</b></font>) was gone Martin rose to follow, but Tom stopped him (<font color='blue'><b>Tom</b></font>). <div class="bookquote">``No one
goes near New Row,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>said he (<font color='blue'><b>Tom</b></font>), <div class="bookquote">``so you may just as well stop here and do
your verses, and then we'll have some more talk. We'll be no end quiet.
Besides, no praepostor comes here now. We haven't been visited once this
half.''

 (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div><p/>So the table was cleared, the cloth restored, and the three fell to work
with Gradus and dictionary upon the morning's vulgus.

<p/>They were three very fair examples of the way in which such tasks were
done at Rugby, in the consulship of Plancus. And doubtless the method
is little changed, for there is nothing new under the sun, especially at
schools.

<p/>Now be it known unto all you boys who are at schools which do not
rejoice in the time-honoured institution of the vulgus -LRB-commonly
supposed to have been established by William of Wykeham at Winchester,
and imported to Rugby by Arnold more for the sake of the lines which
were learnt by heart with it than for its own intrinsic value, as I've
always understood-RRB-, that it is a short exercise in Greek or Latin verse,
on a given subject, the minimum number of lines being fixed for each
form.

<p/>The master of the form gave out at fourth lesson on the previous day the
subject for next morning's vulgus, and at first lesson each boy had to
bring his (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>) vulgus ready to be looked over; and with the vulgus, a
certain number of lines from one of the Latin or Greek poets then being
construed in the form had to be got by heart. The master at first lesson
called up each boy in the form in order, and put him (<font color='blue'><b>master</b></font>) on in the lines.
If he (<font color='blue'><b>master</b></font>) couldn't say them, or seem to say them, by reading them off the
master's or some other boy's book who stood near, he (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>) was sent back,
and went below all the boys who did so say or seem to say them; but
in either case his (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>) vulgus was looked over by the master, who gave and
entered in his (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>) book, to the credit or discredit of the boy, so many
marks as the composition merited. At Rugby vulgus and lines were the
first lesson every other day in the week, on Tuesdays, Thursdays, and
Saturdays; and as there were thirty-eight weeks in the school year, it
is obvious to the meanest capacity that the master of each form had
to set one hundred and fourteen subjects every year, two hundred and
twenty-eight every two years, and so on. Now, to persons of moderate
invention this was a considerable task, and human nature being prone to
repeat itself, it will not be wondered that the masters gave the same
subjects sometimes over again after a certain lapse of time. To meet
and rebuke this bad habit of the masters, the schoolboy mind, with its
accustomed ingenuity, had invented an elaborate system of tradition.
Almost every boy kept his (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>) own vulgus written out in a book, and these
books were duly handed down from boy to boy, till -LRB-if the tradition has
gone on till now-RRB- I suppose the popular boys, in whose hands bequeathed
vulgus-books have accumulated, are prepared with three or four vulguses
on any subject in heaven or earth, or in <div class="bookquote">``more worlds than one,''  (<font color='red'><b>the boys</b></font>)</div>which
an unfortunate master can pitch upon. At any rate, such lucky fellows
had generally one for themselves and one for a friend in my time. The
only objection to the traditionary method of doing your vulguses was the
risk that the successions might have become confused, and so that you
and another follower of traditions should show up the same identical
vulgus some fine morning; in which case, when it happened, considerable
grief was the result. But when did such risk hinder boys or men from
short cuts and pleasant paths?

<p/>Now in the study that night Tom was the upholder of the traditionary
method of vulgus doing. He (<font color='blue'><b>Tom</b></font>) carefully produced two large vulgus-books,
and began diving into them, and picking out a line here, and an ending
there -LRB-tags, as they were vulgarly called-RRB-, till he (<font color='blue'><b>Tom</b></font>) had gotten all
that he (<font color='blue'><b>Tom</b></font>) thought he (<font color='blue'><b>Tom</b></font>) could make fit. He (<font color='blue'><b>Tom</b></font>) then proceeded to patch his (<font color='blue'><b>Tom</b></font>) tags
together with the help of his (<font color='blue'><b>Tom</b></font>) Gradus, producing an incongruous and
feeble result of eight elegiac lines, the minimum quantity for his (<font color='blue'><b>Tom</b></font>) form,
and finishing up with two highly moral lines extra, making ten in
all, which he (<font color='blue'><b>Tom</b></font>) cribbed entire from one of his (<font color='blue'><b>Tom</b></font>) books, beginning <div class="bookquote">``O genus
humanum,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>and which he (<font color='blue'><b>Tom</b></font>) himself must have used a dozen times before,
whenever an unfortunate or wicked hero, of whatever nation or language
under the sun, was the subject. Indeed he (<font color='blue'><b>hero</b></font>) began to have great doubts
whether the master wouldn't remember them, and so only throw them in as
extra lines, because in any case they would call off attention from the
other tags, and if detected, being extra lines, he (<font color='blue'><b>master</b></font>) wouldn't be sent back
to do more in their place, while if they passed muster again he (<font color='blue'><b>master</b></font>) would
get marks for them.

<p/>The second method, pursued by Martin, may be called the dogged or
prosaic method. He (<font color='blue'><b>Martin</b></font>), no more than Tom, took any pleasure in the task,
but having no old vulgus-books of his (<font color='blue'><b>Tom</b></font>) own, or any one's else, could
not follow the traditionary method, for which too, as Tom remarked, he (<font color='blue'><b>Tom</b></font>)
hadn't the genius. Martin then proceeded to write down eight lines in
English, of the most matter-of-fact kind, the first that came into his (<font color='blue'><b>Martin</b></font>)
head; and to convert these, line by line, by main force of Gradus and
dictionary into Latin that would scan. This was all he (<font color='blue'><b>Martin</b></font>) cared for--to
produce eight lines with no false quantities or concords: whether the
words were apt, or what the sense was, mattered nothing; and as the
article was all new, not a line beyond the minimum did the followers of
the dogged method ever produce.

<p/>The third, or artistic method, was Arthur's. He (<font color='blue'><b>Arthur</b></font>) considered first what
point in the character or event which was the subject could most neatly
be brought out within the limits of a vulgus, trying always to get his (<font color='blue'><b>Arthur</b></font>)
idea into the eight lines, but not binding himself to ten or even twelve
lines if he (<font color='blue'><b>Arthur</b></font>) couldn't do this. He (<font color='blue'><b>Arthur</b></font>) then set to work as much as possible
without Gradus or other help, to clothe his (<font color='blue'><b>Arthur</b></font>) idea in appropriate Latin or
Greek, and would not be satisfied till he (<font color='blue'><b>Arthur</b></font>) had polished it well up with
the aptest and most poetic words and phrases he (<font color='blue'><b>Arthur</b></font>) could get at.

<p/>A fourth method, indeed, was used in the school, but of too simple
a kind to require a comment. It may be called the vicarious method,
obtained amongst big boys of lazy or bullying habits, and consisted
simply in making clever boys whom they could thrash do their whole
vulgus for them, and construe it to them afterwards; which latter is a
method not to be encouraged, and which I strongly advise you all not
to practise. Of the others, you will find the traditionary most
troublesome, unless you can steal your vulguses whole -LRB-experto crede-RRB-,
and that the artistic method pays the best both in marks and other ways.

<p/>The vulguses being finished by nine o’clock, and Martin having rejoiced
above measure in the abundance of light, and of Gradus and dictionary,
and other conveniences almost unknown to him (<font color='blue'><b>Martin</b></font>) for getting through the
work, and having been pressed by Arthur to come and do his (<font color='blue'><b>Arthur</b></font>) verses there
whenever he (<font color='blue'><b>Arthur</b></font>) liked, the three boys went down to Martin's den, and Arthur
was initiated into the lore of birds' eggs, to his (<font color='blue'><b>Arthur</b></font>) great delight.
The exquisite colouring and forms astonished and charmed him (<font color='blue'><b>Arthur</b></font>), who had
scarcely ever seen any but a hen's egg or an ostrich's, and by the time
he (<font color='blue'><b>Arthur</b></font>) was lugged away to bed he (<font color='blue'><b>Arthur</b></font>) had learned the names of at least twenty
sorts, and dreamed of the glorious perils of tree-climbing, and that he (<font color='blue'><b>Arthur</b></font>)
had found a roc's egg in the island as big as Sinbad's, and clouded like
a tit-lark's, in blowing which Martin and he (<font color='blue'><b>Martin</b></font>) had nearly been drowned in
the yolk.



<p/>CHAPTER IV--THE BIRD-FANCIERS.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``I have found out a gift for my fair--
I have found where the wood-pigeons breed;
But let me the plunder forbear,
She (<font color='blue'><b>we</b></font>) would say `twas a barbarous deed.'' (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>--ROWE.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``And now, my lad, take them five shilling,
And on my advice in future think;
So Billy pouched them all so willing,
And got that night disguised in drink.'' (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>--MS. Ballad.

<p/>The next morning, at first lesson, Tom was turned back in his (<font color='blue'><b>Tom</b></font>) lines,
and so had to wait till the second round; while Martin and Arthur said
theirs all right, and got out of school at once. When Tom got out and
ran down to breakfast at Harrowell's they were missing, and Stumps
informed him (<font color='blue'><b>Tom</b></font>) that they had swallowed down their breakfasts and gone off
together--where, he (<font color='blue'><b>Tom</b></font>) couldn't say. Tom hurried over his (<font color='blue'><b>Tom</b></font>) own breakfast,
and went first to Martin's study and then to his (<font color='blue'><b>Martin</b></font>) own; but no signs of
the missing boys were to be found. He (<font color='blue'><b>Martin</b></font>) felt half angry and jealous of
Martin. Where could they be gone?

<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Martin</b></font>) learnt second lesson with East and the rest in no very good temper,
and then went out into the quadrangle. About ten minutes before school
Martin and Arthur arrived in the quadrangle breathless; and catching
sight of him (<font color='blue'><b>Martin</b></font>), Arthur rushed up, all excitement, and with a bright glow
on his (<font color='blue'><b>Arthur</b></font>) face.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``O Tom, look here!''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>cried he (<font color='blue'><b>Arthur</b></font>), holding out three moor-hen's eggs; <div class="bookquote">``we've
been down the Barby road, to the pool Martin told us of last night, and
just see what we've got.''

 (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div><p/>Tom wouldn't be pleased, and only looked out for something to find fault
with.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Why, young un,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>said he (<font color='blue'><b>Tom</b></font>), <div class="bookquote">``what have you been after? You don't mean to
say you've been wading?''

 (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div><p/>The tone of reproach made poor little Arthur shrink up in a moment and
look piteous; and Tom with a shrug of his (<font color='blue'><b>Tom</b></font>) shoulders turned his (<font color='blue'><b>Tom</b></font>) anger on
Martin.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Well, I didn't think, Madman, that you'd have been such a muff as to
let him (<font color='blue'><b>Martin</b></font>) be getting wet through at this time of day. You might have done
the wading yourself.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``So I did, of course; only he (<font color='blue'><b>Martin</b></font>) would come in too, to see the nest. We
left six eggs in. They'll be hatched in a day or two.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Hang the eggs!''  (<font color='red'><b>Tom/Brown/Tom Brown</b></font>)</div>said Tom; <div class="bookquote">``a fellow can't turn his (<font color='blue'><b>fellow</b></font>) back for a moment
but all his (<font color='blue'><b>fellow</b></font>) work's undone. He (<font color='blue'><b>fellow</b></font>)'ll be laid up for a week for this precious
lark, I'll be bound.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Tom/Brown/Tom Brown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Indeed, Tom, now,''  (<font color='red'><b>Arthur/George/George Arthur</b></font>)</div>pleaded Arthur, <div class="bookquote">``my feet ain't wet, for Martin made
me take off my shoes and stockings and trousers.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Arthur/George/George Arthur</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``But they are wet, and dirty too; can't I see?''  (<font color='red'><b>Tom/Brown/Tom Brown</b></font>)</div>answered Tom; <div class="bookquote">``and
you'll be called up and floored when the master sees what a state you're
in. You haven't looked at second lesson, you know.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Tom/Brown/Tom Brown</b></font>)</div><p/>O Tom, you old humbug! you to be upbraiding any one with not learning
their lessons! If you hadn't been floored yourself now at first lesson,
do you mean to say you wouldn't have been with them? And you've taken
away all poor little Arthur's joy and pride in his (<font color='blue'><b>Arthur</b></font>) first birds' eggs,
and he (<font color='blue'><b>Arthur</b></font>) goes and puts them down in the study, and takes down his (<font color='blue'><b>Arthur</b></font>) books
with a sigh, thinking he (<font color='blue'><b>Arthur</b></font>) has done something horribly wrong, whereas he (<font color='blue'><b>Arthur</b></font>)
has learnt on in advance much more than will be done at second lesson.

<p/>But the old Madman hasn't, and gets called up, and makes some frightful
shots, losing about ten places, and all but getting floored. This
somewhat appeases Tom's wrath, and by the end of the lesson he (<font color='blue'><b>Tom</b></font>) has
regained his (<font color='blue'><b>Tom</b></font>) temper. And afterwards in their study he (<font color='blue'><b>Tom</b></font>) begins to get
right again, as he (<font color='blue'><b>Tom</b></font>) watches Arthur's intense joy at seeing Martin blowing
the eggs and gluing them carefully on to bits of cardboard, and notes
the anxious, loving looks which the little fellow casts sidelong at him (<font color='blue'><b>Martin</b></font>).
And then he (<font color='blue'><b>Martin</b></font>) thinks, <div class="bookquote">``What an ill-tempered beast I am! Here's just what I
was wishing for last night come about, and I'm spoiling it all,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>and in
another five minutes has swallowed the last mouthful of his (<font color='blue'><b>Martin</b></font>) bile, and is
repaid by seeing his (<font color='blue'><b>Martin</b></font>) little sensitive plant expand again and sun itself
in his (<font color='blue'><b>Martin</b></font>) smiles.

<p/>After dinner the Madman is busy with the preparations for their
expedition, fitting new straps on to his (<font color='blue'><b>Martin</b></font>) climbing-irons, filling large
pill-boxes with cotton-wool, and sharpening East's small axe. They carry
all their munitions into calling-overs and directly afterwards, having
dodged such praepostors as are on the lookout for fags at cricket, the
four set off at a smart trot down the Lawford footpath, straight for
Caldecott's Spinney and the hawk's nest.

<p/>Martin leads the way in high feather; it is quite a new sensation to
him (<font color='blue'><b>Martin</b></font>), getting companions, and he (<font color='blue'><b>Martin</b></font>) finds it very pleasant, and means to
show them all manner of proofs of his (<font color='blue'><b>Martin</b></font>) science and skill. Brown and East
may be better at cricket and football and games, thinks he (<font color='blue'><b>Brown</b></font>), but out in
the fields and woods see if I can't teach them something. He (<font color='blue'><b>Brown</b></font>) has
taken the leadership already, and strides away in front with his (<font color='blue'><b>Brown</b></font>)
climbing-irons strapped under one arm, his (<font color='blue'><b>Brown</b></font>) pecking-bag under the other,
and his (<font color='blue'><b>Brown</b></font>) pockets and hat full of pill-boxes, cotton-wool, and other
etceteras. Each of the others carries a pecking-bag, and East his (<font color='blue'><b>Brown</b></font>)
hatchet.

<p/>When they had crossed three or four fields without a check, Arthur began
to lag; and Tom seeing this shouted to Martin to pull up a bit. <div class="bookquote">``We
ain't out hare-and-hounds. What's the good of grinding on at this rate?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``There's the Spinney,''  (<font color='red'><b>Martin</b></font>)</div>said Martin, pulling up on the brow of a slope
at the bottom of which lay Lawford brook, and pointing to the top of the
opposite slope; <div class="bookquote">``the nest is in one of those high fir-trees at this end.
And down by the brook there I know of a sedge-bird's nest. We'll go and
look at it coming back.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Lawford</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Oh, come on, don't let us stop,''  (<font color='red'><b>Arthur/George/George Arthur</b></font>)</div>said Arthur, who was getting excited
at the sight of the wood. So they broke into a trot again, and were soon
across the brook, up the slope, and into the Spinney. Here they advanced
as noiselessly as possible, lest keepers or other enemies should be
about, and stopped at the foot of a tall fir, at the top of which Martin
pointed out with pride the kestrel's nest, the object of their quest.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Oh, where? which is it?''  (<font color='red'><b>Arthur/George/George Arthur</b></font>)</div>asks Arthur, gaping up in the air, and having
the most vague idea of what it would be like.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``There, don't you see?''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>said East, pointing to a lump of mistletoe in
the next tree, which was a beech. He (<font color='blue'><b>Arthur</b></font>) saw that Martin and Tom were busy
with the climbing-irons, and couldn't resist the temptation of hoaxing.
Arthur stared and wondered more than ever.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Well, how curious! It doesn't look a bit like what I expected,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>said
he (<font color='blue'><b>Arthur</b></font>).

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Very odd birds, kestrels,''  (<font color='red'><b>victim</b></font>)</div>said East, looking waggishly at his (<font color='blue'><b>Arthur</b></font>) victim,
who was still star-gazing.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``But I thought it was in a fir-tree?''  (<font color='red'><b>Arthur/George/George Arthur</b></font>)</div>objected Arthur.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Ah, don't you know? That's a new sort of fir which old Caldecott
brought from the Himalayas.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Really!''  (<font color='red'><b>Arthur/George/George Arthur</b></font>)</div>said Arthur; <div class="bookquote">``I'm glad I know that. How unlike our firs they
are! They do very well too here, don't they? The Spinney's full of
them.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Arthur/George/George Arthur</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``What's that humbug he (<font color='blue'><b>Spinney</b></font>)'s telling you?''  (<font color='red'><b>Tom/Brown/Tom Brown</b></font>)</div>cried Tom, looking up, having
caught the word Himalayas, and suspecting what East was after.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Only about this fir,''  (<font color='red'><b>Arthur/George/George Arthur</b></font>)</div>said Arthur, putting his (<font color='blue'><b>Arthur</b></font>) hand on the stem of the
beech.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Fir!''  (<font color='red'><b>Tom/Brown/Tom Brown</b></font>)</div>shouted Tom; <div class="bookquote">``why, you don't mean to say, young un, you don't
know a beech when you see one?''

 (<font color='red'><b>Tom/Brown/Tom Brown</b></font>)</div><p/>Poor little Arthur looked terribly ashamed, and East exploded in
laughter which made the wood ring.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``I've hardly ever seen any trees,''  (<font color='red'><b>Arthur/George/George Arthur</b></font>)</div>faltered Arthur.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``What a shame to hoax him (<font color='blue'><b>Spinney</b></font>), Scud!''  (<font color='red'><b>Martin</b></font>)</div>cried Martin.--<div class="bookquote">``Never mind, Arthur;
you shall know more about trees than he (<font color='blue'><b>Arthur</b></font>) does in a week or two.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``And isn't that the kestrel's nest, then?''  (<font color='red'><b>Arthur/George/George Arthur</b></font>)</div>asked Arthur. <div class="bookquote">``That! Why,
that's a piece of mistletoe. There's the nest, that lump of sticks up
this fir.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Don't believe him (<font color='blue'><b>Arthur</b></font>), Arthur,''  (<font color='red'><b>Martin</b></font>)</div>struck in the incorrigible East; <div class="bookquote">``I just
saw an old magpie go out of it.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Martin</b></font>)</div><p/>Martin did not deign to reply to this sally, except by a grunt, as
he (<font color='blue'><b>Martin</b></font>) buckled the last buckle of his (<font color='blue'><b>Martin</b></font>) climbing-irons, and Arthur looked
reproachfully at East without speaking.

<p/>But now came the tug of war. It was a very difficult tree to climb until
the branches were reached, the first of which was some fourteen feet
up, for the trunk was too large at the bottom to be swarmed; in fact,
neither of the boys could reach more than half round it with their arms.
Martin and Tom, both of whom had irons on, tried it without success at
first; the fir bark broke away where they stuck the irons in as soon as
they leant any weight on their feet, and the grip of their arms wasn't
enough to keep them up; so, after getting up three or four feet, down
they came slithering to the ground, barking their arms and faces. They
were furious, and East sat by laughing and shouting at each failure,
<div class="bookquote">``Two to one on the old magpie!''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``We must try a pyramid,''  (<font color='red'><b>Tom/Brown/Tom Brown</b></font>)</div>said Tom at last. <div class="bookquote">``Now, Scud, you lazy rascal,
stick yourself against the tree!''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I dare say! and have you standing on my shoulders with the irons on.
What do you think my skin's made of?''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>However, up he (<font color='blue'><b>Tom</b></font>) got, and leant
against the tree, putting his (<font color='blue'><b>Tom</b></font>) head down and clasping it with his (<font color='blue'><b>Tom</b></font>) arms as
far as he (<font color='blue'><b>Tom</b></font>) could.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Now then, Madman,''  (<font color='red'><b>Tom/Brown/Tom Brown</b></font>)</div>said Tom, <div class="bookquote">``you next.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Tom/Brown/Tom Brown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``No, I'm lighter than you; you go next.''  (<font color='red'><b>Tom/Brown/Tom Brown</b></font>)</div>So Tom got on East's shoulders,
and grasped the tree above, and then Martin scrambled up on to Tom's
shoulders, amidst the totterings and groanings of the pyramid, and, with
a spring which sent his (<font color='blue'><b>Martin</b></font>) supporters howling to the ground, clasped the
stem some ten feet up, and remained clinging. For a moment or two they
thought he (<font color='blue'><b>Martin</b></font>) couldn't get up; but then, holding on with arms and teeth, he (<font color='blue'><b>Martin</b></font>)
worked first one iron then the other firmly into the bark, got another
grip with his (<font color='blue'><b>Martin</b></font>) arms, and in another minute had hold of the lowest branch.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``All up with the old magpie now,''  (<font color='red'><b>Martin</b></font>)</div>said East; and after a minute's
rest, up went Martin, hand over hand, watched by Arthur with fearful
eagerness.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Isn't it very dangerous?''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>said he (<font color='blue'><b>Arthur</b></font>).

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Not a bit,''  (<font color='red'><b>Tom/Brown/Tom Brown</b></font>)</div>answered Tom; <div class="bookquote">``you can't hurt if you only get good
hand-hold. Try every branch with a good pull before you trust it, and
then up you go.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Tom/Brown/Tom Brown</b></font>)</div><p/>Martin was now amongst the small branches close to the nest, and
away dashed the old bird, and soared up above the trees, watching the
intruder.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``All right--four eggs!''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>shouted he (<font color='blue'><b>intruder</b></font>).

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Take `em all!''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>shouted East; <div class="bookquote">``that'll be one a-piece.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``No, no; leave one, and then she (<font color='blue'><b>it</b></font>) won't care,''  (<font color='red'><b>Tom/Brown/Tom Brown</b></font>)</div>said Tom.

<p/>We boys had an idea that birds couldn't count, and were quite content as
long as you left one egg. I hope it is so.

<p/>Martin carefully put one egg into each of his (<font color='blue'><b>Martin</b></font>) boxes and the third
into his (<font color='blue'><b>Martin</b></font>) mouth, the only other place of safety, and came down like a
lamplighter. All went well till he (<font color='blue'><b>Martin</b></font>) was within ten feet of the ground,
when, as the trunk enlarged, his (<font color='blue'><b>Martin</b></font>) hold got less and less firm, and at
last down he (<font color='blue'><b>Martin</b></font>) came with a run, tumbling on to his (<font color='blue'><b>Martin</b></font>) back on the turf,
spluttering and spitting out the remains of the great egg, which had
broken by the jar of his (<font color='blue'><b>Martin</b></font>) fall.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Ugh, ugh! something to drink--ugh! it was addled,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>spluttered he (<font color='blue'><b>Martin</b></font>), while
the wood rang again with the merry laughter of East and Tom.

<p/>Then they examined the prizes, gathered up their things, and went off to
the brook, where Martin swallowed huge draughts of water to get rid
of the taste; and they visited the sedge-bird's nest, and from thence
struck across the country in high glee, beating the hedges and brakes as
they went along; and Arthur at last, to his (<font color='blue'><b>Arthur</b></font>) intense delight, was allowed
to climb a small hedgerow oak for a magpie's nest with Tom, who kept all
round him (<font color='blue'><b>Tom</b></font>) like a mother, and showed him (<font color='blue'><b>Tom</b></font>) where to hold and how to throw
his (<font color='blue'><b>Tom</b></font>) weight; and though he (<font color='blue'><b>Tom</b></font>) was in a great fright, didn't show it, and was
applauded by all for his (<font color='blue'><b>Tom</b></font>) lissomness.

<p/>They crossed a road soon afterwards, and there, close to them, lay a
great heap of charming pebbles.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Look here,''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>shouted East; <div class="bookquote">``here's luck! I've been longing for some
good, honest pecking this half-hour. Let's fill the bags, and have no
more of this foozling bird-nesting.''

 (<font color='red'><b>each boy</b></font>)</div><p/>No one objected, so each boy filled the fustian bag he (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>) carried full of
stones. They crossed into the next field, Tom and East taking one side
of the hedges, and the other two the other side. Noise enough they made
certainly, but it was too early in the season for the young birds, and
the old birds were too strong on the wing for our young marksmen,
and flew out of shot after the first discharge. But it was great fun,
rushing along the hedgerows, and discharging stone after stone at
blackbirds and chaffinches, though no result in the shape of slaughtered
birds was obtained; and Arthur soon entered into it, and rushed to head
back the birds, and shouted, and threw, and tumbled into ditches, and
over and through hedges, as wild as the Madman himself.

<p/>Presently the party, in full cry after an old blackbird -LRB-who was
evidently used to the thing and enjoyed the fun, for he (<font color='blue'><b>Arthur</b></font>) would wait till
they came close to him (<font color='blue'><b>Arthur</b></font>), and then fly on for forty yards or so, and, with
an impudent flicker of his (<font color='blue'><b>Arthur</b></font>) tail, dart into the depths of the quickset-RRB-,
came beating down a high double hedge, two on each side.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``There he (<font color='blue'><b>I</b></font>) is again,''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``Head him (<font color='blue'><b>I</b></font>),''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``Let drive,''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``I had him (<font color='blue'><b>I</b></font>) there,''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``Take
care where you're throwing, Madman.''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>The shouts might have been heard a
quarter of a mile off. They were heard some two hundred yards off by a
farmer and two of his (<font color='blue'><b>farmer</b></font>) shepherds, who were doctoring sheep in a fold in
the next field.

<p/>Now, the farmer in question rented a house and yard situate at the end
of the field in which the young bird-fanciers had arrived, which house
and yard he (<font color='blue'><b>farmer</b></font>) didn't occupy or keep any one else in. Nevertheless, like
a brainless and unreasoning Briton, he (<font color='blue'><b>Briton</b></font>) persisted in maintaining on the
premises a large stock of cocks, hens, and other poultry. Of course,
all sorts of depredators visited the place from time to time: foxes and
gipsies wrought havoc in the night; while in the daytime, I regret
to have to confess that visits from the Rugby boys, and consequent
disappearances of ancient and respectable fowls were not unfrequent.
Tom and East had during the period of their outlawry visited the farm in
question for felonious purposes, and on one occasion had conquered and
slain a duck there, and borne away the carcass triumphantly, hidden in
their handkerchiefs. However, they were sickened of the practice by the
trouble and anxiety which the wretched duck's body caused them. They
carried it to Sally Harrowell's, in hopes of a good supper; but she (<font color='blue'><b>Harrowell</b></font>),
after examining it, made a long face, and refused to dress or have
anything to do with it. Then they took it into their study, and began
plucking it themselves; but what to do with the feathers, where to hide
them?

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Good gracious, Tom, what a lot of feathers a duck has!''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>groaned East,
holding a bagful in his (<font color='blue'><b>They</b></font>) hand, and looking disconsolately at the carcass,
not yet half plucked.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``And I do think he (<font color='blue'><b>Tom</b></font>)'s getting high, too, already,''  (<font color='red'><b>Tom/Brown/Tom Brown</b></font>)</div>said Tom, smelling at
him (<font color='blue'><b>Tom</b></font>) cautiously, <div class="bookquote">``so we must finish him (<font color='blue'><b>Tom</b></font>) up soon.''

 (<font color='red'><b>him</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Yes, all very well; but how are we to cook him (<font color='blue'><b>Tom</b></font>)? I'm sure I ain't going
to try it on in the hall or passages; we can't afford to be roasting
ducks about--our character's too bad.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I wish we were rid of the brute,''  (<font color='red'><b>Tom/Brown/Tom Brown</b></font>)</div>said Tom, throwing him (<font color='blue'><b>Tom</b></font>) on the table
in disgust. And after a day or two more it became clear that got rid of
he (<font color='blue'><b>Tom</b></font>) must be; so they packed him (<font color='blue'><b>Tom</b></font>) and sealed him (<font color='blue'><b>Tom</b></font>) up in brown paper, and put
him (<font color='blue'><b>Tom</b></font>) in the cupboard of an unoccupied study, where he (<font color='blue'><b>Tom</b></font>) was found in the
holidays by the matron, a gruesome body.

<p/>They had never been duck-hunting there since, but others had, and the
bold yeoman was very sore on the subject, and bent on making an example
of the first boys he (<font color='blue'><b>yeoman</b></font>) could catch. So he (<font color='blue'><b>yeoman</b></font>) and his (<font color='blue'><b>yeoman</b></font>) shepherds crouched
behind the hurdles, and watched the party, who were approaching all
unconscious. Why should that old guinea-fowl be lying out in the
hedge just at this particular moment of all the year? Who can say?
Guinea-fowls always are; so are all other things, animals, and persons,
requisite for getting one into scrapes--always ready when any mischief
can come of them. At any rate, just under East's nose popped out the old
guinea-hen, scuttling along and shrieking, <div class="bookquote">``Come back, come back,''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>at the top of her (<font color='blue'><b>yeoman</b></font>) voice. Either of the other three might perhaps have
withstood the temptation, but East first lets drive the stone he (<font color='blue'><b>yeoman</b></font>) has in
his (<font color='blue'><b>yeoman</b></font>) hand at her (<font color='blue'><b>yeoman</b></font>), and then rushes to turn her (<font color='blue'><b>yeoman</b></font>) into the hedge again. He (<font color='blue'><b>yeoman</b></font>)
succeeds, and then they are all at it for dear life, up and down the
hedge in full cry, the <div class="bookquote">``Come back, come back,''  (<font color='red'><b>He</b></font>)</div>getting shriller and
fainter every minute.

<p/>Meantime, the farmer and his (<font color='blue'><b>farmer</b></font>) men steal over the hurdles and creep down
the hedge towards the scene of action. They are almost within a stone's
throw of Martin, who is pressing the unlucky chase hard, when Tom
catches sight of them, and sings out, <div class="bookquote">``Louts, `ware louts, your side!
Madman, look ahead!''  (<font color='red'><b>Tom/Brown/Tom Brown</b></font>)</div>and then catching hold of Arthur, hurries him (<font color='blue'><b>Arthur</b></font>) away
across the field towards Rugby as hard as they can tear. Had he (<font color='blue'><b>Arthur</b></font>) been by
himself, he (<font color='blue'><b>Arthur</b></font>) would have stayed to see it out with the others, but now
his (<font color='blue'><b>Arthur</b></font>) heart sinks and all his (<font color='blue'><b>Arthur</b></font>) pluck goes. The idea of being led up to the
Doctor with Arthur for bagging fowls quite unmans and takes half the run
out of him (<font color='blue'><b>Arthur</b></font>).

<p/>However, no boys are more able to take care of themselves than East and
Martin; they dodge the pursuers, slip through a gap, and come pelting
after Tom and Arthur, whom they catch up in no time. The farmer and his (<font color='blue'><b>farmer</b></font>)
men are making good running about a field behind. Tom wishes to himself
that they had made off in any other direction, but now they are all in
for it together, and must see it out.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``You won't leave the young un, will you?''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>says he (<font color='blue'><b>Tom</b></font>), as they haul poor
little Arthur, already losing wind from the fright, through the next
hedge. <div class="bookquote">``Not we,''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>is the answer from both. The next hedge is a stiff
one; the pursuers gain horribly on them, and they only just pull Arthur
through, with two great rents in his (<font color='blue'><b>Arthur</b></font>) trousers, as the foremost shepherd
comes up on the other side. As they start into the next field, they are
aware of two figures walking down the footpath in the middle of it, and
recognize Holmes and Diggs taking a constitutional. Those good-natured
fellows immediately shout, <div class="bookquote">``On.''  (<font color='red'><b>Those fellows</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``Let's go to them and surrender,''
 (<font color='red'><b>Tom/Brown/Tom Brown</b></font>)</div>pants Tom. Agreed. And in another minute the four boys, to the great
astonishment of those worthies, rush breathless up to Holmes and Diggs,
who pull up to see what is the matter; and then the whole is explained
by the appearance of the farmer and his (<font color='blue'><b>farmer</b></font>) men, who unite their forces and
bear down on the knot of boys.

<p/>There is no time to explain, and Tom's heart beats frightfully quick, as
he (<font color='blue'><b>Tom</b></font>) ponders, <div class="bookquote">``Will they stand by us?''

 (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div><p/>The farmer makes a rush at East and collars him (<font color='blue'><b>farmer</b></font>); and that young
gentleman, with unusual discretion, instead of kicking his (<font color='blue'><b>gentleman</b></font>) shins, looks
appealingly at Holmes, and stands still.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Hullo there; not so fast,''  (<font color='red'><b>Holmes</b></font>)</div>says Holmes, who is bound to stand up for
them till they are proved in the wrong. <div class="bookquote">``Now what's all this about?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I've got the young varmint at last, have I,''  (<font color='red'><b>pants the farmer</b></font>)</div>pants the farmer; <div class="bookquote">``why,
they've been a-skulking about my yard and stealing my fowls--that's
where `tis; and if I doan't have they flogged for it, every one on `em,
my name ain't Thompson.''

 (<font color='red'><b>pants the farmer</b></font>)</div><p/>Holmes looks grave and Diggs's face falls. They are quite ready to
fight--no boys in the school more so; but they are praepostors, and
understand their office, and can't uphold unrighteous causes.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``I haven't been near his (<font color='blue'><b>Thompson</b></font>) old barn this half,''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>cries East. <div class="bookquote">``Nor I,''  (<font color='red'><b>Tom/Brown/Tom Brown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``Nor
I,''  (<font color='red'><b>Tom/Brown/Tom Brown</b></font>)</div>chime in Tom and Martin.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Now, Willum, didn't you see `em there last week?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Ees, I seen `em sure enough,''  (<font color='red'><b>Willum/Smith/Willum Smith</b></font>)</div>says Willum, grasping a prong he (<font color='blue'><b>Willum</b></font>) carried,
and preparing for action.

<p/>The boys deny stoutly, and Willum is driven to admit that <div class="bookquote">``if it worn't
they `twas chaps as like `em as two peas’n;''  (<font color='red'><b>Willum/Smith/Willum Smith</b></font>)</div>and <div class="bookquote">``leastways he (<font color='blue'><b>Willum</b></font>)'ll swear
he (<font color='blue'><b>Willum</b></font>) see'd them two in the yard last Martinmas,''  (<font color='red'><b>Willum/Smith/Willum Smith</b></font>)</div>indicating East and Tom.

<p/>Holmes has had time to meditate. <div class="bookquote">``Now, sir,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>says he (<font color='blue'><b>Holmes</b></font>) to Willum, <div class="bookquote">``you see
you can't remember what you have seen, and I believe the boys.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Willum/Smith/Willum Smith</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I doan't care,''  (<font color='red'><b>the farmer</b></font>)</div>blusters the farmer; <div class="bookquote">``they was arter my fowls
to-day--that's enough for I.--Willum, you catch hold o' t'other chap.
They've been a-sneaking about this two hours, I tells `ee,''  (<font color='red'><b>the farmer</b></font>)</div>shouted he (<font color='blue'><b>Willum</b></font>),
as Holmes stands between Martin and Willum, <div class="bookquote">``and have druv a matter of a
dozen young pullets pretty nigh to death.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Willum/Smith/Willum Smith</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Oh, there's a whacker!''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>cried East; <div class="bookquote">``we haven't been within a hundred
yards of his (<font color='blue'><b>chap</b></font>) barn; we haven't been up here above ten minutes, and we've
seen nothing but a tough old guinea-hen, who ran like a greyhound.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Indeed, that's all true, Holmes, upon my honour,''  (<font color='red'><b>Tom/Brown/Tom Brown</b></font>)</div>added Tom; <div class="bookquote">``we
weren't after his (<font color='blue'><b>Holmes</b></font>) fowls; guinea-hen ran out of the hedge under our feet,
and we've seen nothing else.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Tom/Brown/Tom Brown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Drat their talk. Thee catch hold o' t'other, Willum, and come along wi'
un.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Farmer Thompson,''  (<font color='red'><b>Holmes</b></font>)</div>said Holmes, warning off Willum and the prong with
his (<font color='blue'><b>Holmes</b></font>) stick, while Diggs faced the other shepherd, cracking his (<font color='blue'><b>Diggs</b></font>) fingers
like pistol-shots, <div class="bookquote">``now listen to reason. The boys haven't been after
your fowls, that's plain.''

 (<font color='red'><b>the shepherd</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Tells `ee I see'd’em. Who be you, I should like to know?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Never you mind, farmer,''  (<font color='red'><b>Holmes</b></font>)</div>answered Holmes. <div class="bookquote">``And now I'll just tell you
what it is: you ought to be ashamed of yourself for leaving all that
poultry about, with no one to watch it, so near the School. You deserve
to have it all stolen. So if you choose to come up to the Doctor with
them, I shall go with you, and tell him (<font color='blue'><b>Doctor</b></font>) what I think of it.''

 (<font color='red'><b>The farmer</b></font>)</div><p/>The farmer began to take Holmes for a master; besides, he (<font color='blue'><b>Holmes</b></font>) wanted to get
back to his (<font color='blue'><b>Holmes</b></font>) flock. Corporal punishment was out of the question, the odds
were too great; so he (<font color='blue'><b>Holmes</b></font>) began to hint at paying for the damage. Arthur
jumped at this, offering to pay anything, and the farmer immediately
valued the guinea-hen at half a sovereign.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Half a sovereign!''  (<font color='red'><b>the farmer</b></font>)</div>cried East, now released from the farmer's grip;
<div class="bookquote">``well, that is a good one! The old hen ain't hurt a bit, and she (<font color='blue'><b>you</b></font>)'s seven
years old, I know, and as tough as whipcord; she (<font color='blue'><b>you</b></font>) couldn't lay another
egg to save her (<font color='blue'><b>you</b></font>) life.''

 (<font color='red'><b>the farmer</b></font>)</div><p/>It was at last settled that they should pay the farmer two shillings,
and his (<font color='blue'><b>farmer</b></font>) man one shilling; and so the matter ended, to the unspeakable
relief of Tom, who hadn't been able to say a word, being sick at heart
at the idea of what the Doctor would think of him (<font color='blue'><b>Doctor</b></font>); and now the whole
party of boys marched off down the footpath towards Rugby. Holmes, who
was one of the best boys in the School, began to improve the occasion.
<div class="bookquote">``Now, you youngsters,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>said he (<font color='blue'><b>Holmes</b></font>), as he (<font color='blue'><b>Holmes</b></font>) marched along in the middle of
them, <div class="bookquote">``mind this; you're very well out of this scrape. Don't you go near
Thompson's barn again; do you hear?''

 (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div><p/>Profuse promises from all, especially East.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Mind, I don't ask questions,''  (<font color='red'><b>Mentor</b></font>)</div>went on Mentor, <div class="bookquote">``but I rather think some
of you have been there before this after his (<font color='blue'><b>Thompson</b></font>) chickens. Now, knocking
over other people's chickens, and running off with them, is stealing.
It's a nasty word, but that's the plain English of it. If the chickens
were dead and lying in a shop, you wouldn't take them, I know that, any
more than you would apples out of Griffith's basket; but there's no real
difference between chickens running about and apples on a tree, and the
same articles in a shop. I wish our morals were sounder in such matters.
There's nothing so mischievous as these school distinctions, which
jumble up right and wrong, and justify things in us for which poor boys
would be sent to prison.''  (<font color='red'><b>Mentor</b></font>)</div>And good old Holmes delivered his (<font color='blue'><b>Holmes</b></font>) soul on the
walk home of many wise sayings, and, as the song says,

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Gee'd `em a sight of good advice;''

 (<font color='red'><b>Holmes</b></font>)</div><p/>which same sermon sank into them all, more or less, and very penitent
they were for several hours. But truth compels me to admit that East, at
any rate, forgot it all in a week, but remembered the insult which had
been put upon him (<font color='blue'><b>Holmes</b></font>) by Farmer Thompson, and with the Tadpole and other
hair-brained youngsters committed a raid on the barn soon afterwards,
in which they were caught by the shepherds and severely handled, besides
having to pay eight shillings--all the money they had in the world--to
escape being taken up to the Doctor.

<p/>Martin became a constant inmate in the joint study from this time, and
Arthur took to him (<font color='blue'><b>Arthur</b></font>) so kindly that Tom couldn't resist slight fits of
jealousy, which, however, he (<font color='blue'><b>Tom</b></font>) managed to keep to himself. The kestrel's
eggs had not been broken, strange to say, and formed the nucleus
of Arthur's collection, at which Martin worked heart and soul, and
introduced Arthur to Howlett the bird-fancier, and instructed him (<font color='blue'><b>Howlett</b></font>) in
the rudiments of the art of stuffing. In token of his (<font color='blue'><b>Howlett</b></font>) gratitude, Arthur
allowed Martin to tattoo a small anchor on one of his (<font color='blue'><b>Martin</b></font>) wrists; which
decoration, however, he (<font color='blue'><b>Martin</b></font>) carefully concealed from Tom. Before the end of
the half-year he (<font color='blue'><b>Martin</b></font>) had trained into a bold climber and good runner, and,
as Martin had foretold, knew twice as much about trees, birds, flowers,
and many other things, as our good-hearted and facetious young friend
Harry East.



<p/>CHAPTER V--THE FIGHT:

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Surgebat Macnevisius
Et mox jactabat ultro,
Pugnabo tua gratia
Feroci hoc Mactwoltro.'' (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>--Etonian.

<p/>There is a certain sort of fellow--we who are used to studying boys all
know him (<font color='blue'><b>fellow</b></font>) well enough--of whom you can predicate with almost positive
certainty, after he (<font color='blue'><b>fellow</b></font>) has been a month at school, that he (<font color='blue'><b>fellow</b></font>) is sure to have
a fight, and with almost equal certainty that he (<font color='blue'><b>fellow</b></font>) will have but one. Tom
Brown was one of these; and as it is our well-weighed intention to give
a full, true, and correct account of Tom's only single combat with a
school-fellow in the manner of our old friend Bell's Life, let those
young persons whose stomachs are not strong, or who think a good set-to
with the weapons which God has given us all an uncivilized, unchristian,
or ungentlemanly affair, just skip this chapter at once, for it won't be
to their taste.

<p/>It was not at all usual in those days for two School-house boys to
have a fight. Of course there were exceptions, when some cross-grained,
hard-headed fellow came up who would never be happy unless he (<font color='blue'><b>fellow</b></font>) was
quarrelling with his (<font color='blue'><b>fellow</b></font>) nearest neighbours, or when there was some
class-dispute, between the fifth form and the fags, for instance, which
required blood-letting; and a champion was picked out on each side
tacitly, who settled the matter by a good hearty mill. But, for the
most part, the constant use of those surest keepers of the peace, the
boxing-gloves, kept the School-house boys from fighting one another. Two
or three nights in every week the gloves were brought out, either in the
hall or fifth-form room; and every boy who was ever likely to fight at
all knew all his (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>) neighbours' prowess perfectly well, and could tell to a
nicety what chance he (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>) would have in a stand-up fight with any other
boy in the house. But, of course, no such experience could be gotten as
regarded boys in other houses; and as most of the other houses were more
or less jealous of the School-house, collisions were frequent.

<p/>After all, what would life be without fighting, I should like to know?
From the cradle to the grave, fighting, rightly understood, is the
business, the real highest, honestest business of every son of man.
Every one who is worth his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) salt has his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) enemies, who must be beaten, be
they evil thoughts and habits in himself, or spiritual wickednesses in
high places, or Russians, or Border-ruffians, or Bill, Tom, or Harry,
who will not let him (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) live his (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) life in quiet till he (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) has thrashed them.

<p/>It is no good for quakers, or any other body of men, to uplift their
voices against fighting. Human nature is too strong for them, and they
don't follow their own precepts. Every soul of them is doing his (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) own
piece of fighting, somehow and somewhere. The world might be a better
world without fighting, for anything I know, but it wouldn't be our
world; and therefore I am dead against crying peace when there is no
peace, and isn't meant to be. I am as sorry as any man to see folk
fighting the wrong people and the wrong things, but I'd a deal sooner
see them doing that than that they should have no fight in them. So
having recorded, and being about to record, my hero's fights of all
sorts, with all sorts of enemies, I shall now proceed to give an account
of his (<font color='blue'><b>hero</b></font>) passage-at-arms with the only one of his (<font color='blue'><b>hero</b></font>) school-fellows whom he (<font color='blue'><b>hero</b></font>)
ever had to encounter in this manner.

<p/>It was drawing towards the close of Arthur's first half-year, and
the May evenings were lengthening out. Locking-up was not till eight
o’clock, and everybody was beginning to talk about what he (<font color='blue'><b>Arthur</b></font>) would do in
the holidays. The shell, in which form all our dramatis personae now
are, were reading, amongst other things, the last book of Homer's
<div class="bookquote">``Iliad,''  (<font color='red'><b>Homer</b></font>)</div>and had worked through it as far as the speeches of the women
over Hector's body. It is a whole school-day, and four or five of the
School-house boys -LRB-amongst whom are Arthur, Tom, and East-RRB- are preparing
third lesson together. They have finished the regulation forty lines,
and are for the most part getting very tired, notwithstanding
the exquisite pathos of Helen's lamentation. And now several long
four-syllabled words come together, and the boy with the dictionary
strikes work.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``I am not going to look out any more words,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>says he (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>); <div class="bookquote">``we've done the
quantity. Ten to one we shan't get so far. Let's go out into the close.''

 (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Come along, boys,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>cries East, always ready to leave <div class="bookquote">``the grind,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>as he (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>)
called it; <div class="bookquote">``our old coach is laid up, you know, and we shall have one of
the new masters, who's sure to go slow and let us down easy.''

 (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div><p/>So an adjournment to the close was carried nem. con., little Arthur not
daring to uplift his (<font color='blue'><b>Arthur</b></font>) voice; but, being deeply interested in what they
were reading, stayed quietly behind, and learnt on for his (<font color='blue'><b>Arthur</b></font>) own pleasure.

<p/>As East had said, the regular master of the form was unwell, and they
were to be heard by one of the new masters--quite a young man, who had
only just left the university. Certainly it would be hard lines if,
by dawdling as much as possible in coming in and taking their places,
entering into long-winded explanations of what was the usual course of
the regular master of the form, and others of the stock contrivances of
boys for wasting time in school, they could not spin out the lesson so
that he (<font color='blue'><b>master</b></font>) should not work them through more than the forty lines. As to
which quantity there was a perpetual fight going on between the master
and his (<font color='blue'><b>master</b></font>) form--the latter insisting, and enforcing by passive resistance,
that it was the prescribed quantity of Homer for a shell lesson; the
former, that there was no fixed quantity, but that they must always be
ready to go on to fifty or sixty lines if there were time within the
hour. However, notwithstanding all their efforts, the new master got on
horribly quick. He (<font color='blue'><b>master</b></font>) seemed to have the bad taste to be really interested
in the lesson, and to be trying to work them up into something like
appreciation of it, giving them good, spirited English words, instead
of the wretched bald stuff into which they rendered poor old Homer, and
construing over each piece himself to them, after each boy, to show them
how it should be done.

<p/>Now the clock strikes the three-quarters; there is only a quarter of an
hour more, but the forty lines are all but done. So the boys, one after
another, who are called up, stick more and more, and make balder and
ever more bald work of it. The poor young master is pretty near beat by
this time, and feels ready to knock his (<font color='blue'><b>master</b></font>) head against the wall, or his (<font color='blue'><b>master</b></font>)
fingers against somebody else's head. So he (<font color='blue'><b>master</b></font>) gives up altogether the
lower and middle parts of the form, and looks round in despair at the
boys on the top bench, to see if there is one out of whom he (<font color='blue'><b>master</b></font>) can strike
a spark or two, and who will be too chivalrous to murder the most
beautiful utterances of the most beautiful woman of the old world. His (<font color='blue'><b>master</b></font>)
eye rests on Arthur, and he (<font color='blue'><b>master</b></font>) calls him (<font color='blue'><b>master</b></font>) up to finish construing Helen's
speech. Whereupon all the other boys draw long breaths, and begin to
stare about and take it easy. They are all safe: Arthur is the head of
the form, and sure to be able to construe, and that will tide on safely
till the hour strikes.

<p/>Arthur proceeds to read out the passage in Greek before construing it,
as the custom is. Tom, who isn't paying much attention, is suddenly
caught by the falter in his (<font color='blue'><b>Tom</b></font>) voice as he (<font color='blue'><b>Tom</b></font>) reads the two lines--

<p/>-LSB-greek text deleted-RSB-

<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Tom</b></font>) looks up at Arthur. <div class="bookquote">``Why, bless us,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>thinks he (<font color='blue'><b>Arthur</b></font>), <div class="bookquote">``what can be the
matter with the young un? He (<font color='blue'><b>coach</b></font>)'s never going to get floored. He (<font color='blue'><b>coach</b></font>)'s sure
to have learnt to the end.''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>Next moment he (<font color='blue'><b>Arthur</b></font>) is reassured by the spirited
tone in which Arthur begins construing, and betakes himself to drawing
dogs' heads in his (<font color='blue'><b>Arthur</b></font>) notebook, while the master, evidently enjoying the
change, turns his (<font color='blue'><b>master</b></font>) back on the middle bench and stands before Arthur,
beating a sort of time with his (<font color='blue'><b>Arthur</b></font>) hand and foot, and saying; <div class="bookquote">``Yes, yes,''
 (<font color='red'><b>Arthur/George/George Arthur</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``Very well,''  (<font color='red'><b>Arthur/George/George Arthur</b></font>)</div>as Arthur goes on.

<p/>But as he (<font color='blue'><b>Arthur</b></font>) nears the fatal two lines, Tom catches that falter, and again
looks up. He (<font color='blue'><b>Tom</b></font>) sees that there is something the matter; Arthur can hardly
get on at all. What can it be?

<p/>Suddenly at this point Arthur breaks down altogether, and fairly bursts
out crying, and dashes the cuff of his (<font color='blue'><b>Arthur</b></font>) jacket across his (<font color='blue'><b>Arthur</b></font>) eyes, blushing
up to the roots of his (<font color='blue'><b>Arthur</b></font>) hair, and feeling as if he (<font color='blue'><b>Arthur</b></font>) should like to go down
suddenly through the floor. The whole form are taken aback; most of them
stare stupidly at him (<font color='blue'><b>Arthur</b></font>), while those who are gifted with presence of mind
find their places and look steadily at their books, in hopes of not
catching the master's eye and getting called up in Arthur's place.

<p/>The master looks puzzled for a moment, and then seeing, as the fact is,
that the boy is really affected to tears by the most touching thing in
Homer, perhaps in all profane poetry put together, steps up to him (<font color='blue'><b>Homer</b></font>) and
lays his (<font color='blue'><b>Homer</b></font>) hand kindly on his (<font color='blue'><b>Homer</b></font>) shoulder, saying, <div class="bookquote">``Never mind, my little
man, you've construed very well. Stop a minute; there's no hurry.''

 (<font color='red'><b>him</b></font>)</div><p/>Now, as luck would have it, there sat next above Tom on that day, in
the middle bench of the form, a big boy, by name Williams, generally
supposed to be the cock of the shell, therefore of all the school below
the fifths. The small boys, who are great speculators on the prowess of
their elders, used to hold forth to one another about Williams's great
strength, and to discuss whether East or Brown would take a licking from
him (<font color='blue'><b>Brown</b></font>). He (<font color='blue'><b>Brown</b></font>) was called Slogger Williams, from the force with which it was
supposed he (<font color='blue'><b>Brown</b></font>) could hit. In the main, he (<font color='blue'><b>Brown</b></font>) was a rough, goodnatured fellow
enough, but very much alive to his (<font color='blue'><b>Brown</b></font>) own dignity. He (<font color='blue'><b>Brown</b></font>) reckoned himself
the king of the form, and kept up his (<font color='blue'><b>Brown</b></font>) position with the strong hand,
especially in the matter of forcing boys not to construe more than the
legitimate forty lines. He (<font color='blue'><b>Brown</b></font>) had already grunted and grumbled to himself
when Arthur went on reading beyond the forty lines; but now that he (<font color='blue'><b>Arthur</b></font>)
had broken down just in the middle of all the long words, the Slogger's
wrath was fairly roused.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Sneaking little brute,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>muttered he (<font color='blue'><b>Arthur</b></font>), regardless of prudence--<div class="bookquote">``clapping
on the water-works just in the hardest place; see if I don't punch his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>)
head after fourth lesson.''

 (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Whose?''  (<font color='red'><b>Tom/Brown/Tom Brown</b></font>)</div>said Tom, to whom the remark seemed to be addressed.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Why, that little sneak, Arthur's,''  (<font color='red'><b>Williams/Slogger Williams</b></font>)</div>replied Williams.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``No, you shan't,''  (<font color='red'><b>Tom/Brown/Tom Brown</b></font>)</div>said Tom.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Hullo!''  (<font color='red'><b>Williams/Slogger Williams</b></font>)</div>exclaimed Williams, looking at Tom with great surprise for a
moment, and then giving him (<font color='blue'><b>Williams</b></font>) a sudden dig in the ribs with his (<font color='blue'><b>Williams</b></font>) elbow,
which sent Tom's books flying on to the floor, and called the attention
of the master, who turned suddenly round, and seeing the state of
things, said,--

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Williams, go down three places, and then go on.''

 (<font color='red'><b>the master</b></font>)</div><p/>The Slogger found his (<font color='blue'><b>master</b></font>) legs very slowly, and proceeded to go below Tom
and two other boys with great disgust; and then, turning round and
facing the master, said, <div class="bookquote">``I haven't learnt any more, sir; our lesson is
only forty lines.''

 (<font color='red'><b>the master</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Is that so?''  (<font color='red'><b>the master</b></font>)</div>said the master, appealing generally to the top bench. No
answer.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Who is the head boy of the form?''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>said he (<font color='blue'><b>master</b></font>), waxing wroth.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Arthur, sir,''  (<font color='red'><b>sir boys</b></font>)</div>answered three or four boys, indicating our friend.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Oh, your name's Arthur. Well, now, what is the length of your regular
lesson?''

 (<font color='red'><b>Arthur/George/George Arthur</b></font>)</div><p/>Arthur hesitated a moment, and then said, <div class="bookquote">``We call it only forty lines,
sir.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Arthur/George/George Arthur</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``How do you mean--you call it?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Well, sir, Mr. Graham says we ain't to stop there when there's time to
construe more.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I understand,''  (<font color='red'><b>the master</b></font>)</div>said the master.--<div class="bookquote">``Williams, go down three more places,
and write me out the lesson in Greek and English. And now, Arthur,
finish construing.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Oh! would I be in Arthur's shoes after fourth lesson?''  (<font color='red'><b>the boys</b></font>)</div>said the little
boys to one another; but Arthur finished Helen's speech without any
further catastrophe, and the clock struck four, which ended third
lesson.

<p/>Another hour was occupied in preparing and saying fourth lesson, during
which Williams was bottling up his (<font color='blue'><b>Williams</b></font>) wrath; and when five struck, and the
lessons for the day were over, he (<font color='blue'><b>Williams</b></font>) prepared to take summary vengeance on
the innocent cause of his (<font color='blue'><b>Williams</b></font>) misfortune.

<p/>Tom was detained in school a few minutes after the rest, and on coming
out into the quadrangle, the first thing he (<font color='blue'><b>Tom</b></font>) saw was a small ring of
boys, applauding Williams, who was holding Arthur by the collar.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``There, you young sneak,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>said he (<font color='blue'><b>Arthur</b></font>), giving Arthur a cuff on the head with
his (<font color='blue'><b>Arthur</b></font>) other hand; <div class="bookquote">``what made you say that--''

 (<font color='red'><b>Arthur/George/George Arthur</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Hullo!''  (<font color='red'><b>Arthur/George/George Arthur</b></font>)</div>said Tom, shouldering into the crowd; <div class="bookquote">``you drop that, Williams;
you shan't touch him (<font color='blue'><b>Williams</b></font>).''

 (<font color='red'><b>Tom/Brown/Tom Brown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Who'll stop me?''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>said the Slogger, raising his (<font color='blue'><b>Tom</b></font>) hand again.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``I,''  (<font color='red'><b>Tom/Brown/Tom Brown</b></font>)</div>said Tom; and suiting the action to the word he (<font color='blue'><b>Tom</b></font>) struck the arm
which held Arthur's arm so sharply that the Slogger dropped it with a
start, and turned the full current of his (<font color='blue'><b>Arthur</b></font>) wrath on Tom.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Will you fight?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Yes, of course.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Huzza! There's going to be a fight between Slogger Williams and Tom
Brown!''

 (<font color='red'><b>boys</b></font>)</div><p/>The news ran like wildfire about, and many boys who were on their way
to tea at their several houses turned back, and sought the back of the
chapel, where the fights come off.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Just run and tell East to come and back me,''  (<font color='red'><b>Tom/Brown/Tom Brown</b></font>)</div>said Tom to a small
School-house boy, who was off like a rocket to Harrowell's, just
stopping for a moment to poke his (<font color='blue'><b>Tom</b></font>) head into the School-house hall, where
the lower boys were already at tea, and sing out, <div class="bookquote">``Fight! Tom Brown and
Slogger Williams.''

 (<font color='red'><b>the boys</b></font>)</div><p/>Up start half the boys at once, leaving bread, eggs, butter, sprats,
and all the rest to take care of themselves. The greater part of the
remainder follow in a minute, after swallowing their tea, carrying their
food in their hands to consume as they go. Three or four only remain,
who steal the butter of the more impetuous, and make to themselves an
unctuous feast.

<p/>In another minute East and Martin tear through the quadrangle, carrying
a sponge, and arrive at the scene of action just as the combatants are
beginning to strip.

<p/>Tom felt he (<font color='blue'><b>Tom</b></font>) had got his (<font color='blue'><b>Tom</b></font>) work cut out for him (<font color='blue'><b>Tom</b></font>), as he (<font color='blue'><b>Tom</b></font>) stripped off his (<font color='blue'><b>Tom</b></font>)
jacket, waistcoat, and braces. East tied his (<font color='blue'><b>Tom</b></font>) handkerchief round his (<font color='blue'><b>Tom</b></font>)
waist, and rolled up his (<font color='blue'><b>Tom</b></font>) shirtsleeves for him (<font color='blue'><b>Tom</b></font>). <div class="bookquote">``Now, old boy, don't you
open your mouth to say a word, or try to help yourself a bit--we'll do
all that; you keep all your breath and strength for the Slogger.''  (<font color='red'><b>Martin</b></font>)</div>Martin
meanwhile folded the clothes, and put them under the chapel rails; and
now Tom, with East to handle him (<font color='blue'><b>Tom</b></font>), and Martin to give him (<font color='blue'><b>Martin</b></font>) a knee, steps
out on the turf, and is ready for all that may come; and here is the
Slogger too, all stripped, and thirsting for the fray.

<p/>It doesn't look a fair match at first glance: Williams is nearly two
inches taller, and probably a long year older than his (<font color='blue'><b>Williams</b></font>) opponent, and he (<font color='blue'><b>Williams</b></font>)
is very strongly made about the arms and shoulders--<div class="bookquote">``peels well,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>as the
little knot of big fifth-form boys, the amateurs, say, who stand outside
the ring of little boys, looking complacently on, but taking no active
part in the proceedings. But down below he (<font color='blue'><b>Williams</b></font>) is not so good by any
means--no spring from the loins, and feeblish, not to say shipwrecky,
about the knees. Tom, on the contrary, though not half so strong in the
arms, is good all over, straight, hard, and springy, from neck to ankle,
better perhaps in his (<font color='blue'><b>Tom</b></font>) legs than anywhere. Besides, you can see by the
clear white of his (<font color='blue'><b>Tom</b></font>) eye, and fresh, bright look of his (<font color='blue'><b>Tom</b></font>) skin, that he (<font color='blue'><b>Tom</b></font>) is
in tip-top training, able to do all he (<font color='blue'><b>Tom</b></font>) knows; while the Slogger looks
rather sodden, as if he (<font color='blue'><b>Tom</b></font>) didn't take much exercise and ate too much
tuck. The time-keeper is chosen, a large ring made, and the two stand
up opposite one another for a moment, giving us time just to make our
little observations.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``If Tom'll only condescend to fight with his (<font color='blue'><b>Tom</b></font>) head and heels,''  (<font color='red'><b>Martin</b></font>)</div>as East
mutters to Martin, <div class="bookquote">``we shall do.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Martin</b></font>)</div><p/>But seemingly he (<font color='blue'><b>Martin</b></font>) won't, for there he (<font color='blue'><b>Martin</b></font>) goes in, making play with both
hands. Hard all is the word; the two stand to one another like men;
rally follows rally in quick succession, each fighting as if he (<font color='blue'><b>Martin</b></font>) thought
to finish the whole thing out of hand. <div class="bookquote">``Can't last at this rate,''  (<font color='red'><b>the ones</b></font>)</div>say
the knowing ones, while the partisans of each make the air ring
with their shouts and counter-shouts of encouragement, approval, and
defiance.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Take it easy, take it easy; keep away; let him (<font color='blue'><b>Tom</b></font>) come after you,''
 (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>implores East, as he (<font color='blue'><b>Martin</b></font>) wipes Tom's face after the first round with a wet
sponge, while he (<font color='blue'><b>Martin</b></font>) sits back on Martin's knee, supported by the Madman's
long arms which tremble a little from excitement.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Time's up,''  (<font color='red'><b>the time-keeper</b></font>)</div>calls the time-keeper.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``There he (<font color='blue'><b>Tom</b></font>) goes again, hang it all!''  (<font color='red'><b>man</b></font>)</div>growls East, as his (<font color='blue'><b>Martin</b></font>) man is at it
again, as hard as ever. A very severe round follows, in which Tom gets
out and out the worst of it, and is at last hit clean off his (<font color='blue'><b>Tom</b></font>) legs, and
deposited on the grass by a right-hander from the Slogger.

<p/>Loud shouts rise from the boys of Slogger's house, and the School-house
are silent and vicious, ready to pick quarrels anywhere.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Two to one in half-crowns on the big un,''  (<font color='red'><b>the amateurs</b></font>)</div>says Rattle, one of the
amateurs, a tall fellow, in thunder-and-lightning waistcoat, and puffy,
good-natured face.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Done!''  (<font color='red'><b>friend</b></font>)</div>says Groove, another amateur of quieter look, taking out his (<font color='blue'><b>fellow</b></font>)
notebook to enter it, for our friend Rattle sometimes forgets these
little things.

<p/>Meantime East is freshening up Tom with the sponges for next round, and
has set two other boys to rub his (<font color='blue'><b>Tom</b></font>) hands.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Tom, old boy,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>whispers he (<font color='blue'><b>Tom</b></font>), <div class="bookquote">``this may be fun for you, but it's death to
me. He (<font color='blue'><b>Tom</b></font>)'ll hit all the fight out of you in another five minutes, and then
I shall go and drown myself in the island ditch. Feint him (<font color='blue'><b>Tom</b></font>); use your
legs; draw him (<font color='blue'><b>Tom</b></font>) about. He (<font color='blue'><b>Tom</b></font>)'ll lose his (<font color='blue'><b>Tom</b></font>) wind then in no time, and you can
go into him (<font color='blue'><b>Tom</b></font>). Hit at his (<font color='blue'><b>Tom</b></font>) body too; we'll take care of his (<font color='blue'><b>Tom</b></font>) frontispiece
by-and-by.''

 (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div><p/>Tom felt the wisdom of the counsel, and saw already that he (<font color='blue'><b>Tom</b></font>) couldn't go
in and finish the Slogger off at mere hammer and tongs, so changed his (<font color='blue'><b>Tom</b></font>)
tactics completely in the third round. He (<font color='blue'><b>Tom</b></font>) now fights cautiously, getting
away from and parrying the Slogger's lunging hits, instead of trying
to counter, and leading his (<font color='blue'><b>Tom</b></font>) enemy a dance all round the ring after
him (<font color='blue'><b>Tom</b></font>). <div class="bookquote">``He (<font color='blue'><b>Tom</b></font>)'s funking; go in, Williams,''  (<font color='red'><b>the boys</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``Catch him (<font color='blue'><b>Williams</b></font>) up,''  (<font color='red'><b>the boys</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``Finish him (<font color='blue'><b>Williams</b></font>) off,''
 (<font color='red'><b>the boys</b></font>)</div>scream the small boys of the Slogger party.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Just what we want,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>thinks East, chuckling to himself, as he (<font color='blue'><b>Tom</b></font>) sees
Williams, excited by these shouts, and thinking the game in his (<font color='blue'><b>Tom</b></font>) own
hands, blowing himself in his (<font color='blue'><b>Tom</b></font>) exertions to get to close quarters again,
while Tom is keeping away with perfect ease.

<p/>They quarter over the ground again and again, Tom always on the
defensive.

<p/>The Slogger pulls up at last for a moment, fairly blown.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Now, then, Tom,''  (<font color='red'><b>Tom/Brown/Tom Brown</b></font>)</div>sings out East, dancing with delight. Tom goes in in a
twinkling, and hits two heavy body blows, and gets away again before the
Slogger can catch his (<font color='blue'><b>Tom</b></font>) wind, which when he (<font color='blue'><b>Tom</b></font>) does he (<font color='blue'><b>Tom</b></font>) rushes with blind fury
at Tom, and being skilfully parried and avoided, overreaches himself and
falls on his (<font color='blue'><b>Tom</b></font>) face, amidst terrific cheers from the School-house boys.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Double your two to one?''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>says Groove to Rattle, notebook in hand.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Stop a bit,''  (<font color='red'><b>hero</b></font>)</div>says that hero, looking uncomfortably at Williams, who is
puffing away on his (<font color='blue'><b>Williams</b></font>) second's knee, winded enough, but little the worse
in any other way.

<p/>After another round the Slogger too seems to see that he (<font color='blue'><b>Williams</b></font>) can't go in and
win right off, and has met his (<font color='blue'><b>Williams</b></font>) match or thereabouts. So he (<font color='blue'><b>Williams</b></font>) too begins
to use his (<font color='blue'><b>Williams</b></font>) head, and tries to make Tom lose his (<font color='blue'><b>Tom</b></font>) patience, and come in
before his (<font color='blue'><b>Tom</b></font>) time. And so the fight sways on, now one and now the other
getting a trifling pull.

<p/>Tom's face begins to look very one-sided--there are little queer bumps
on his (<font color='blue'><b>Tom</b></font>) forehead, and his (<font color='blue'><b>Tom</b></font>) mouth is bleeding; but East keeps the wet
sponge going so scientifically that he (<font color='blue'><b>Tom</b></font>) comes up looking as fresh and
bright as ever. Williams is only slightly marked in the face, but by
the nervous movement of his (<font color='blue'><b>Williams</b></font>) elbows you can see that Tom's body blows are
telling. In fact, half the vice of the Slogger's hitting is neutralized,
for he (<font color='blue'><b>Tom</b></font>) daren't lunge out freely for fear of exposing his (<font color='blue'><b>Tom</b></font>) sides. It is
too interesting by this time for much shouting, and the whole ring is
very quiet.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``All right, Tommy,''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>whispers East; <div class="bookquote">``hold on's the horse that's to win.
We've got the last. Keep your head, old boy.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Arthur</b></font>)</div><p/>But where is Arthur all this time? Words cannot paint the poor little
fellow's distress. He (<font color='blue'><b>fellow</b></font>) couldn't muster courage to come up to the ring,
but wandered up and down from the great fives court to the corner of the
chapel rails, now trying to make up his (<font color='blue'><b>fellow</b></font>) mind to throw himself between
them, and try to stop them; then thinking of running in and telling his (<font color='blue'><b>fellow</b></font>)
friend Mary, who, he (<font color='blue'><b>fellow</b></font>) knew, would instantly report to the Doctor.
The stories he (<font color='blue'><b>fellow</b></font>) had heard of men being killed in prize-fights rose up
horribly before him (<font color='blue'><b>fellow</b></font>).

<p/>Once only, when the shouts of <div class="bookquote">``Well done, Brown!''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``Huzza for the
School-house!''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>rose higher than ever, he (<font color='blue'><b>fellow</b></font>) ventured up to the ring,
thinking the victory was won. Catching sight of Tom's face in the state
I have described, all fear of consequences vanishing out of his (<font color='blue'><b>Tom</b></font>) mind;
he (<font color='blue'><b>Tom</b></font>) rushed straight off to the matron's room, beseeching her (<font color='blue'><b>matron</b></font>) to get the
fight stopped, or he (<font color='blue'><b>Tom</b></font>) should die.

<p/>But it's time for us to get back to the close. What is this fierce
tumult and confusion? The ring is broken, and high and angry words are
being bandied about. <div class="bookquote">``It's all fair'' (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>--<div class="bookquote">``It isn't'' (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>--<div class="bookquote">``No hugging!''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>The
fight is stopped. The combatants, however, sit there quietly, tended by
their seconds, while their adherents wrangle in the middle. East can't
help shouting challenges to two or three of the other side, though he (<font color='blue'><b>Tom</b></font>)
never leaves Tom for a moment, and plies the sponges as fast as ever.

<p/>The fact is, that at the end of the last round, Tom, seeing a good
opening, had closed with his (<font color='blue'><b>Tom</b></font>) opponent, and after a moment's struggle,
had thrown him (<font color='blue'><b>Tom</b></font>) heavily, by help of the fall he (<font color='blue'><b>Tom</b></font>) had learnt from his (<font color='blue'><b>Tom</b></font>)
village rival in the Vale of White Horse. Williams hadn't the ghost of
a chance with Tom at wrestling; and the conviction broke at once on
the Slogger faction that if this were allowed their man must be licked.
There was a strong feeling in the School against catching hold and
throwing, though it was generally ruled all fair within limits; so the
ring was broken and the fight stopped.

<p/>The School-house are overruled--the fight is on again, but there is to
be no throwing; and East, in high wrath, threatens to take his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) man away
after next round -LRB-which he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) don't mean to do, by the way-RRB-, when suddenly
young Brooke comes through the small gate at the end of the chapel. The
School-house faction rush to him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>). <div class="bookquote">``Oh, hurrah! now we shall get fair
play.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Please, Brooke, come up. They won't let Tom Brown throw him (<font color='blue'><b>Brown</b></font>).''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Throw whom?''  (<font color='red'><b>Brooke</b></font>)</div>says Brooke, coming up to the ring. <div class="bookquote">``Oh! Williams, I see.
Nonsense! Of course he (<font color='blue'><b>Williams</b></font>) may throw him (<font color='blue'><b>Williams</b></font>), if he (<font color='blue'><b>Williams</b></font>) catches him (<font color='blue'><b>Williams</b></font>) fairly above the
waist.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Brooke</b></font>)</div><p/>Now, young Brooke, you're in the sixth, you know, and you ought to stop
all fights. He (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) looks hard at both boys. <div class="bookquote">``Anything wrong?''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>says he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) to
East, nodding at Tom.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Not a bit.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Not beat at all?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Bless you, no! Heaps of fight in him (<font color='blue'><b>Williams</b></font>).--Ain't there, Tom?''

 (<font color='red'><b>Tom/Brown/Tom Brown</b></font>)</div><p/>Tom looks at Brooke and grins.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``How's he (<font color='blue'><b>Tom</b></font>)?''  (<font color='red'><b>Williams/Slogger Williams</b></font>)</div>nodding at Williams.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``So so; rather done, I think, since his (<font color='blue'><b>Tom</b></font>) last fall. He (<font color='blue'><b>Tom</b></font>) won't stand above
two more.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Time's up!''  (<font color='red'><b>The boys</b></font>)</div>The boys rise again and face one another. Brooke can't find
it in his (<font color='blue'><b>Tom</b></font>) heart to stop them just yet, so the round goes on, the Slogger
waiting for Tom, and reserving all his (<font color='blue'><b>Tom</b></font>) strength to hit him (<font color='blue'><b>Tom</b></font>) out should
he (<font color='blue'><b>Tom</b></font>) come in for the wrestling dodge again, for he (<font color='blue'><b>Tom</b></font>) feels that that must be
stopped, or his (<font color='blue'><b>Tom</b></font>) sponge will soon go up in the air.

<p/>And now another newcomer appears on the field, to wit, the under-porter,
with his (<font color='blue'><b>newcomer</b></font>) long brush and great wooden receptacle for dust under his (<font color='blue'><b>newcomer</b></font>) arm.
He (<font color='blue'><b>newcomer</b></font>) has been sweeping out the schools.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``You'd better stop, gentlemen,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>newcomer</b></font>) says; <div class="bookquote">``the Doctor knows that Brown's
fighting--he (<font color='blue'><b>Doctor</b></font>)'ll be out in a minute.''

 (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``You go to Bath, Bill,''  (<font color='red'><b>that servitor</b></font>)</div>is all that that excellent servitor gets by
his (<font color='blue'><b>newcomer</b></font>) advice; and being a man of his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) hands, and a stanch upholder of the
School-house, can't help stopping to look on for a bit, and see Tom
Brown, their pet craftsman, fight a round.

<p/>It is grim earnest now, and no mistake. Both boys feel this, and summon
every power of head, hand, and eye to their aid. A piece of luck on
either side, a foot slipping, a blow getting well home, or another fall,
may decide it. Tom works slowly round for an opening; he (<font color='blue'><b>Tom</b></font>) has all the
legs, and can choose his (<font color='blue'><b>Tom</b></font>) own time. The Slogger waits for the attack,
and hopes to finish it by some heavy right-handed blow. As they quarter
slowly over the ground, the evening sun comes out from behind a cloud
and falls full on Williams's face. Tom darts in; the heavy right hand
is delivered, but only grazes his (<font color='blue'><b>Tom</b></font>) head. A short rally at close quarters,
and they close; in another moment the Slogger is thrown again heavily
for the third time.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``I'll give you three or two on the little one in half-crowns,''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>said
Groove to Rattle.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``No, thank `ee,''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>answers the other, diving his (<font color='blue'><b>Tom</b></font>) hands farther into his (<font color='blue'><b>Tom</b></font>)
coat-tails.

<p/>Just at this stage of the proceedings, the door of the turret which
leads to the Doctor's library suddenly opens, and he (<font color='blue'><b>Doctor</b></font>) steps into the
close, and makes straight for the ring, in which Brown and the Slogger
are both seated on their seconds' knees for the last time.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``The Doctor! the Doctor!''  (<font color='red'><b>some boy</b></font>)</div>shouts some small boy who catches sight of
him (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>), and the ring melts away in a few seconds, the small boys tearing
off, Tom collaring his (<font color='blue'><b>Tom</b></font>) jacket and waistcoat, and slipping through the
little gate by the chapel, and round the corner to Harrowell's with his (<font color='blue'><b>Tom</b></font>)
backers, as lively as need be; Williams and his (<font color='blue'><b>Williams</b></font>) backers making off not
quite so fast across the close; Groove, Rattle, and the other bigger
fellows trying to combine dignity and prudence in a comical manner, and
walking off fast enough, they hope, not to be recognized, and not fast
enough to look like running away.

<p/>Young Brooke alone remains on the ground by the time the Doctor gets
there, and touches his (<font color='blue'><b>Doctor</b></font>) hat, not without a slight inward qualm.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Hah! Brooke. I am surprised to see you here. Don't you know that I
expect the sixth to stop fighting?''

 (<font color='red'><b>Brooke</b></font>)</div><p/>Brooke felt much more uncomfortable than he (<font color='blue'><b>Doctor</b></font>) had expected, but he (<font color='blue'><b>Doctor</b></font>) was
rather a favourite with the Doctor for his (<font color='blue'><b>Doctor</b></font>) openness and plainness of
speech, so blurted out, as he (<font color='blue'><b>Doctor</b></font>) walked by the Doctor's side, who had
already turned back,--

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Yes, sir, generally. But I thought you wished us to exercise a
discretion in the matter too--not to interfere too soon.''

 (<font color='red'><b>the Doctor</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``But they have been fighting this half-hour and more,''  (<font color='red'><b>the Doctor</b></font>)</div>said the Doctor.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Yes, sir; but neither was hurt. And they're the sort of boys who'll be
all the better friends now, which they wouldn't have been if they had
been stopped, any earlier--before it was so equal.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Who was fighting with Brown?''  (<font color='red'><b>the Doctor</b></font>)</div>said the Doctor.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Williams, sir, of Thompson's. He (<font color='blue'><b>Thompson</b></font>) is bigger than Brown, and had the best
of it at first, but not when you came up, sir. There's a good deal of
jealousy between our house and Thompson's, and there would have been
more fights if this hadn't been let go on, or if either of them had had
much the worst of it.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Well but, Brooke,''  (<font color='red'><b>the Doctor</b></font>)</div>said the Doctor, <div class="bookquote">``doesn't this look a little as
if you exercised your discretion by only stopping a fight when the
School-house boy is getting the worst of it?''

 (<font color='red'><b>the Doctor</b></font>)</div><p/>Brooke, it must be confessed, felt rather gravelled.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Now remember,''  (<font color='red'><b>the Doctor</b></font>)</div>added the Doctor, as he (<font color='blue'><b>Doctor</b></font>) stopped at the turret-door,
<div class="bookquote">``this fight is not to go on; you'll see to that. And I expect you to
stop all fights in future at once.''

 (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Very well, sir,''  (<font color='red'><b>Brooke</b></font>)</div>said young Brooke, touching his (<font color='blue'><b>Doctor</b></font>) hat, and not sorry to
see the turret-door close behind the Doctor's back.

<p/>Meantime Tom and the stanchest of his (<font color='blue'><b>Tom</b></font>) adherents had reached Harrowell's,
and Sally was bustling about to get them a late tea, while Stumps had
been sent off to Tew, the butcher, to get a piece of raw beef for Tom's
eye, which was to be healed off-hand, so that he (<font color='blue'><b>Tom</b></font>) might show well in the
morning. He (<font color='blue'><b>Tom</b></font>) was not a bit the worse, except a slight difficulty in his (<font color='blue'><b>Tom</b></font>)
vision, a singing in his (<font color='blue'><b>Tom</b></font>) ears, and a sprained thumb, which he (<font color='blue'><b>Tom</b></font>) kept in
a cold-water bandage, while he (<font color='blue'><b>Tom</b></font>) drank lots of tea, and listened to the
babel of voices talking and speculating of nothing but the fight, and
how Williams would have given in after another fall -LRB-which he (<font color='blue'><b>Williams</b></font>) didn't in
the least believe-RRB-, and how on earth the Doctor could have got to know
of it--such bad luck! He (<font color='blue'><b>Doctor</b></font>) couldn't help thinking to himself that he (<font color='blue'><b>Doctor</b></font>) was
glad he (<font color='blue'><b>Doctor</b></font>) hadn't won; he (<font color='blue'><b>Doctor</b></font>) liked it better as it was, and felt very friendly
to the Slogger. And then poor little Arthur crept in and sat down
quietly near him (<font color='blue'><b>Arthur</b></font>), and kept looking at him (<font color='blue'><b>Arthur</b></font>) and the raw beef with such
plaintive looks that Tom at last burst out laughing.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Don't make such eyes, young un,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>said he (<font color='blue'><b>Tom</b></font>); <div class="bookquote">``there's nothing the matter.''

 (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Oh, but, Tom, are you much hurt? I can't bear thinking it was all for
me.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Not a bit of it; don't flatter yourself. We were sure to have had it
out sooner or later.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Well, but you won't go on, will you? You'll promise me you won't go
on?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Can't tell about that--all depends on the houses. We're in the hands
of our countrymen, you know. Must fight for the School-house flag, if so
be.''

 (<font color='red'><b>the lovers</b></font>)</div><p/>However, the lovers of the science were doomed to disappointment this
time. Directly after locking-up, one of the night-fags knocked at Tom's
door.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Brown, young Brooke wants you in the sixth-form room.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Tom/Brown/Tom Brown</b></font>)</div><p/>Up went Tom to the summons, and found the magnates sitting at their
supper.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Well, Brown,''  (<font color='red'><b>Brooke</b></font>)</div>said young Brooke, nodding to him (<font color='blue'><b>Tom</b></font>), <div class="bookquote">``how do you feel?''

 (<font color='red'><b>him</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Oh, very well, thank you, only I've sprained my thumb, I think.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Sure to do that in a fight. Well, you hadn't the worst of it, I could
see. Where did you learn that throw?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Down in the country when I was a boy.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Hullo! why, what are you now? Well, never mind, you're a plucky fellow.
Sit down and have some supper.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Tom/Brown/Tom Brown</b></font>)</div><p/>Tom obeyed, by no means loath. And the fifth-form boy next filled him (<font color='blue'><b>Tom</b></font>) a
tumbler of bottled beer, and he (<font color='blue'><b>Tom</b></font>) ate and drank, listening to the pleasant
talk, and wondering how soon he (<font color='blue'><b>Tom</b></font>) should be in the fifth, and one of that
much-envied society.

<p/>As he (<font color='blue'><b>Tom</b></font>) got up to leave, Brooke said, <div class="bookquote">``You must shake hands to-morrow
morning; I shall come and see that done after first lesson.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Brooke</b></font>)</div><p/>And so he (<font color='blue'><b>Tom</b></font>) did. And Tom and the Slogger shook hands with great
satisfaction and mutual respect. And for the next year or two, whenever
fights were being talked of, the small boys who had been present shook
their heads wisely, saying, <div class="bookquote">``Ah! but you should just have seen the fight
between Slogger Williams and Tom Brown!''

 (<font color='red'><b>the boys</b></font>)</div><p/>And now, boys all, three words before we quit the subject. I have put
in this chapter on fighting of malice prepense, partly because I want to
give you a true picture of what everyday school life was in my time, and
not a kid-glove and go-to-meeting-coat picture, and partly because of
the cant and twaddle that's talked of boxing and fighting with fists
nowadays. Even Thackeray has given in to it; and only a few weeks ago
there was some rampant stuff in the Times on the subject, in an article
on field sports.

<p/>Boys will quarrel, and when they quarrel will sometimes fight. Fighting
with fists is the natural and English way for English boys to settle
their quarrels. What substitute for it is there, or ever was there,
amongst any nation under the sun? What would you like to see take its
place?

<p/>Learn to box, then, as you learn to play cricket and football. Not one
of you will be the worse, but very much the better, for learning to box
well. Should you never have to use it in earnest, there's no exercise
in the world so good for the temper and for the muscles of the back and
legs.

<p/>As to fighting, keep out of it if you can, by all means. When the
time comes, if it ever should, that you have to say <div class="bookquote">``Yes''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>or <div class="bookquote">``No''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>to
a challenge to fight, say <div class="bookquote">``No''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>if you can--only take care you make
it clear to yourselves why you say <div class="bookquote">``No.''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>It's a proof of the highest
courage, if done from true Christian motives. It's quite right and
justifiable, if done from a simple aversion to physical pain and danger.
But don't say <div class="bookquote">``No''  (<font color='red'><b>God</b></font>)</div>because you fear a licking, and say or think it's
because you fear God, for that's neither Christian nor honest. And if
you do fight, fight it out; and don't give in while you can stand and
see.



<p/>CHAPTER VI--FEVER IN THE SCHOOL.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``This our hope for all that's mortal
And we too shall burst the bond;
Death keeps watch beside the portal,
But `tis life that dwells beyond.''
 (<font color='red'><b>JOHN</b></font>)</div>--JOHN STERLING.

<p/>Two years have passed since the events recorded in the last chapter, and
the end of the summer half-year is again drawing on. Martin has left and
gone on a cruise in the South Pacific, in one of his (<font color='blue'><b>Martin</b></font>) uncle's ships; the
old magpie, as disreputable as ever, his (<font color='blue'><b>Martin</b></font>) last bequest to Arthur, lives
in the joint study. Arthur is nearly sixteen, and at the head of the
twenty, having gone up the school at the rate of a form a half-year.
East and Tom have been much more deliberate in their progress, and are
only a little way up the fifth form. Great strapping boys they are,
but still thorough boys, filling about the same place in the house that
young Brooke filled when they were new boys, and much the same sort
of fellows. Constant intercourse with Arthur has done much for both of
them, especially for Tom; but much remains yet to be done, if they
are to get all the good out of Rugby which is to be got there in these
times. Arthur is still frail and delicate, with more spirit than body;
but, thanks to his (<font color='blue'><b>Arthur</b></font>) intimacy with them and Martin, has learned to swim,
and run, and play cricket, and has never hurt himself by too much
reading.

<p/>One evening, as they were all sitting down to supper in the fifth-form
room, some one started a report that a fever had broken out at one of
the boarding-houses. <div class="bookquote">``They say,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Arthur</b></font>) added, <div class="bookquote">``that Thompson is very ill,
and that Dr. Robertson has been sent for from Northampton.''

 (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Then we shall all be sent home,''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>cried another. <div class="bookquote">``Hurrah! five weeks'
extra holidays, and no fifth-form examination!''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I hope not,''  (<font color='red'><b>Tom/Brown/Tom Brown</b></font>)</div>said Tom; <div class="bookquote">``there'll be no Marylebone match then at the end
of the half.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Tom/Brown/Tom Brown</b></font>)</div><p/>Some thought one thing, some another, many didn't believe the report;
but the next day, Tuesday, Dr. Robertson arrived, and stayed all day,
and had long conferences with the Doctor.

<p/>On Wednesday morning, after prayers, the Doctor addressed the whole
school. There were several cases of fever in different houses, he (<font color='blue'><b>Doctor</b></font>) said;
but Dr. Robertson, after the most careful examination, had assured him (<font color='blue'><b>Robertson</b></font>)
that it was not infectious, and that if proper care were taken,
there could be no reason for stopping the school-work at present. The
examinations were just coming on, and it would be very unadvisable to
break up now. However, any boys who chose to do so were at liberty to
write home, and, if their parents wished it, to leave at once. He (<font color='blue'><b>Robertson</b></font>) should
send the whole school home if the fever spread.

<p/>The next day Arthur sickened, but there was no other case. Before the
end of the week thirty or forty boys had gone, but the rest stayed on.
There was a general wish to please the Doctor, and a feeling that it was
cowardly to run away.

<p/>On the Saturday Thompson died, in the bright afternoon, while the
cricket-match was going on as usual on the big-side ground. The Doctor,
coming from his (<font color='blue'><b>Doctor</b></font>) deathbed, passed along the gravel-walk at the side
of the close, but no one knew what had happened till the next day. At
morning lecture it began to be rumoured, and by afternoon chapel was
known generally; and a feeling of seriousness and awe at the actual
presence of death among them came over the whole school. In all the long
years of his (<font color='blue'><b>Doctor</b></font>) ministry the Doctor perhaps never spoke words which sank
deeper than some of those in that day's sermon.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``When I came yesterday from visiting all but the very death-bed of him (<font color='blue'><b>Robertson</b></font>)
who has been taken from us, and looked around upon all the familiar
objects and scenes within our own ground, where your common amusements
were going on with your common cheerfulness and activity, I felt there
was nothing painful in witnessing that; it did not seem in any way
shocking or out of tune with those feelings which the sight of a dying
Christian must be supposed to awaken. The unsuitableness in point of
natural feeling between scenes of mourning and scenes of liveliness did
not at all present itself. But I did feel that if at that moment any of
those faults had been brought before me which sometimes occur amongst
us; had I heard that any of you had been guilty of falsehood, or of
drunkenness, or of any other such sin; had I heard from any quarter the
language of profaneness, or of unkindness, or of indecency; had I heard
or seen any signs of that wretched folly which courts the laugh of
fools by affecting not to dread evil and not to care for good, then the
unsuitableness of any of these things with the scene I had just quitted
would indeed have been most intensely painful. And why? Not because such
things would really have been worse than at any other time, but because
at such a moment the eyes are opened really to know good and evil,
because we then feel what it is so to live as that death becomes an
infinite blessing, and what it is so to live also that it were good for
us if we had never been born.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Tom/Brown/Tom Brown</b></font>)</div><p/>Tom had gone into chapel in sickening anxiety about Arthur, but he (<font color='blue'><b>Arthur</b></font>) came
out cheered and strengthened by those grand words, and walked up alone
to their study. And when he (<font color='blue'><b>Arthur</b></font>) sat down and looked round, and saw Arthur's
straw hat and cricket-jacket hanging on their pegs, and marked all his (<font color='blue'><b>Arthur</b></font>)
little neat arrangements, not one of which had been disturbed, the tears
indeed rolled down his (<font color='blue'><b>Arthur</b></font>) cheeks; but they were calm and blessed tears, and
he (<font color='blue'><b>Arthur</b></font>) repeated to himself, <div class="bookquote">``Yes, Geordie's eyes are opened; he (<font color='blue'><b>Geordie</b></font>) knows what
it is so to live as that death becomes an infinite blessing. But do I? O
God, can I bear to lose him (<font color='blue'><b>God</b></font>)?''

 (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div><p/>The week passed mournfully away. No more boys sickened, but Arthur was
reported worse each day, and his (<font color='blue'><b>Arthur</b></font>) mother arrived early in the week. Tom
made many appeals to be allowed to see him (<font color='blue'><b>Tom</b></font>), and several times tried to
get up to the sick-room; but the housekeeper was always in the way, and
at last spoke to the Doctor, who kindly but peremptorily forbade him (<font color='blue'><b>Doctor</b></font>).

<p/>Thompson was buried on the Tuesday, and the burial service, so soothing
and grand always, but beyond all words solemn when read over a boy's
grave to his (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>) companions, brought him (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>) much comfort, and many strange
new thoughts and longings. He (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>) went back to his (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>) regular life, and played
cricket and bathed as usual. It seemed to him (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>) that this was the right
thing to do, and the new thoughts and longings became more brave and
healthy for the effort. The crisis came on Saturday; the day week that
Thompson had died; and during that long afternoon Tom sat in his (<font color='blue'><b>Tom</b></font>) study
reading his (<font color='blue'><b>Tom</b></font>) Bible, and going every half-hour to the housekeeper's room,
expecting each time to hear that the gentle and brave little spirit
had gone home. But God had work for Arthur to do. The crisis passed:
on Sunday evening he (<font color='blue'><b>Arthur</b></font>) was declared out of danger; on Monday he (<font color='blue'><b>Arthur</b></font>) sent a
message to Tom that he (<font color='blue'><b>Tom</b></font>) was almost well, had changed his (<font color='blue'><b>Tom</b></font>) room, and was to
be allowed to see him (<font color='blue'><b>Tom</b></font>) the next day.

<p/>It was evening when the housekeeper summoned him (<font color='blue'><b>Tom</b></font>) to the sick-room.
Arthur was lying on the sofa by the open window, through which the rays
of the western sun stole gently, lighting up his (<font color='blue'><b>Arthur</b></font>) white face and golden
hair. Tom remembered a German picture of an angel which he (<font color='blue'><b>Tom</b></font>) knew; often
had he (<font color='blue'><b>Tom</b></font>) thought how transparent and golden and spirit-like it was; and
he (<font color='blue'><b>Tom</b></font>) shuddered, to think how like it Arthur looked, and felt a shock as if
his (<font color='blue'><b>Arthur</b></font>) blood had all stopped short, as he (<font color='blue'><b>Arthur</b></font>) realized how near the other world
his (<font color='blue'><b>Arthur</b></font>) friend must have been to look like that. Never till that moment had
he (<font color='blue'><b>Arthur</b></font>) felt how his (<font color='blue'><b>Arthur</b></font>) little chum had twined himself round his (<font color='blue'><b>Arthur</b></font>) heart-strings,
and as he (<font color='blue'><b>Arthur</b></font>) stole gently across the room and knelt down, and put his (<font color='blue'><b>Arthur</b></font>) arm
round Arthur's head on the pillow, felt ashamed and half-angry at his (<font color='blue'><b>Arthur</b></font>)
own red and brown face, and the bounding sense of health and power which
filled every fibre of his (<font color='blue'><b>Arthur</b></font>) body, and made every movement of mere living a
joy to him (<font color='blue'><b>Arthur</b></font>). He (<font color='blue'><b>Arthur</b></font>) needn't have troubled himself: it was this very strength
and power so different from his (<font color='blue'><b>Arthur</b></font>) own which drew Arthur so to him (<font color='blue'><b>Arthur</b></font>).

<p/>Arthur laid his (<font color='blue'><b>Arthur</b></font>) thin, white hand, on which the blue veins stood out so
plainly, on Tom's great brown fist, and smiled at him (<font color='blue'><b>Tom</b></font>); and then looked
out of the window again, as if he (<font color='blue'><b>Tom</b></font>) couldn't bear to lose a moment of the
sunset, into the tops of the great feathery elms, round which the rooks
were circling and clanging, returning in flocks from their evening's
foraging parties. The elms rustled, the sparrows in the ivy just outside
the window chirped and fluttered about, quarrelling, and making it up
again; the rooks, young and old, talked in chorus, and the merry shouts
of the boys and the sweet click of the cricket-bats came up cheerily
from below.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Dear George,''  (<font color='red'><b>Tom/Brown/Tom Brown</b></font>)</div>said Tom, <div class="bookquote">``I am so glad to be let up to see you at last.
I've tried hard to come so often, but they wouldn't let me before.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Tom/Brown/Tom Brown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Oh, I know, Tom; Mary has told me every day about you, and how she (<font color='blue'><b>Mary</b></font>) was
obliged to make the Doctor speak to you to keep you away. I'm very glad
you didn't get up, for you might have caught it; and you couldn't stand
being ill, with all the matches going on. And you're in the eleven, too,
I hear. I'm so glad.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Yes; ain't it jolly?''  (<font color='red'><b>Tom/Brown/Tom Brown</b></font>)</div>said Tom proudly. <div class="bookquote">``I'm ninth too. I made forty at
the last pie-match, and caught three fellows out. So I was put in
above Jones and Tucker. Tucker's so savage, for he (<font color='blue'><b>Tucker</b></font>) was head of the
twenty-two.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Well, I think you ought to be higher yet,''  (<font color='red'><b>Arthur/George/George Arthur</b></font>)</div>said Arthur, who was as
jealous for the renown of Tom in games as Tom was for his (<font color='blue'><b>Tom</b></font>) as a scholar.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Never mind. I don't care about cricket or anything now you're getting
well, Geordie; and I shouldn't have hurt, I know, if they'd have let me
come up. Nothing hurts me. But you'll get about now directly, won't you?
You won't believe how clean I've kept the study. All your things are
just as you left them; and I feed the old magpie just when you used,
though I have to come in from big-side for him (<font color='blue'><b>Geordie</b></font>), the old rip. He (<font color='blue'><b>Geordie</b></font>) won't
look pleased all I can do, and sticks his (<font color='blue'><b>Geordie</b></font>) head first on one side and
then on the other, and blinks at me before he (<font color='blue'><b>Geordie</b></font>)'ll begin to eat, till I'm
half inclined to box his (<font color='blue'><b>Geordie</b></font>) ears. And whenever East comes in, you should
see him (<font color='blue'><b>Geordie</b></font>) hop off to the window, dot and go one, though Harry wouldn't
touch a feather of him (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) now.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Arthur/George/George Arthur</b></font>)</div><p/>Arthur laughed. <div class="bookquote">``Old Gravey has a good memory; he (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) can't forget the
sieges of poor Martin's den in old times.''  (<font color='red'><b>He</b></font>)</div>He (<font color='blue'><b>Arthur</b></font>) paused a moment, and then
went on: <div class="bookquote">``You can't think how often I've been thinking of old Martin
since I've been ill. I suppose one's mind gets restless, and likes to
wander off to strange, unknown places. I wonder what queer new pets the
old boy has got. How he (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>) must be revelling in the thousand new birds,
beasts, and fishes!''

 (<font color='red'><b>He</b></font>)</div><p/>Tom felt a pang of jealousy, but kicked it out in a moment. <div class="bookquote">``Fancy him (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>)
on a South Sea island, with the Cherokees, or Patagonians, or some
such wild niggers!''  (<font color='red'><b>Tom/Brown/Tom Brown</b></font>)</div>-LRB-Tom's ethnology and geography were faulty,
but sufficient for his (<font color='blue'><b>Tom</b></font>) needs.-RRB- <div class="bookquote">``They'll make the old Madman cock
medicine-man, and tattoo him (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>) all over. Perhaps he (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>)'s cutting about now
all blue, and has a squaw and a wigwam. He (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>)'ll improve their boomerangs,
and be able to throw them too, without having old Thomas sent after him (<font color='blue'><b>Thomas</b></font>)
by the Doctor to take them away.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Arthur/George/George Arthur</b></font>)</div><p/>Arthur laughed at the remembrance of the boomerang story, but then
looked grave again, and said, <div class="bookquote">``He (<font color='blue'><b>Thomas</b></font>)'ll convert all the island, I know.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Arthur/George/George Arthur</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Yes, if he (<font color='blue'><b>Thomas</b></font>) don't blow it up first.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Do you remember, Tom, how you and East used to laugh at him (<font color='blue'><b>Tom</b></font>) and chaff
him (<font color='blue'><b>Tom</b></font>), because he (<font color='blue'><b>Tom</b></font>) said he (<font color='blue'><b>Tom</b></font>) was sure the rooks all had calling-over or
prayers, or something of the sort, when the locking-up bell rang? Well,
I declare,''  (<font color='red'><b>Arthur/George/George Arthur</b></font>)</div>said Arthur, looking up seriously into Tom's laughing eyes,
<div class="bookquote">``I do think he (<font color='blue'><b>Tom</b></font>) was right. Since I've been lying here, I've watched them
every night; and, do you know, they really do come and perch, all of
them, just about locking-up time; and then first there's a regular
chorus of caws; and then they stop a bit, and one old fellow, or perhaps
two or three in different trees, caw solos; and then off they all go
again, fluttering about and cawing anyhow till they roost.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Tom/Brown/Tom Brown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I wonder if the old blackies do talk,''  (<font color='red'><b>Tom/Brown/Tom Brown</b></font>)</div>said Tom, looking up at them.
<div class="bookquote">``How they must abuse me and East, and pray for the Doctor for stopping
the slinging!''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``There! look, look!''  (<font color='red'><b>Arthur/George/George Arthur</b></font>)</div>cried Arthur; <div class="bookquote">``don't you see the old fellow without
a tail coming up? Martin used to call him (<font color='blue'><b>Martin</b></font>) the `clerk.' He (<font color='blue'><b>Martin</b></font>) can't steer
himself. You never saw such fun as he (<font color='blue'><b>Martin</b></font>) is in a high wind, when he (<font color='blue'><b>Martin</b></font>) can't
steer himself home, and gets carried right past the trees, and has to
bear up again and again before he (<font color='blue'><b>Martin</b></font>) can perch.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Arthur/George/George Arthur</b></font>)</div><p/>The locking-up bell began to toll, and the two boys were silent, and
listened to it. The sound soon carried Tom off to the river and the
woods, and he (<font color='blue'><b>Tom</b></font>) began to go over in his (<font color='blue'><b>Tom</b></font>) mind the many occasions on which
he (<font color='blue'><b>Tom</b></font>) had heard that toll coming faintly down the breeze, and had to pack
his (<font color='blue'><b>Tom</b></font>) rod in a hurry and make a run for it, to get in before the gates
were shut. He (<font color='blue'><b>Tom</b></font>) was roused with a start from his (<font color='blue'><b>Tom</b></font>) memories by Arthur's
voice, gentle and weak from his (<font color='blue'><b>Tom</b></font>) late illness.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Tom, will you be angry if I talk to you very seriously?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``No, dear old boy, not I. But ain't you faint, Arthur, or ill? What can
I get you? Don't say anything to hurt yourself now--you are very weak;
let me come up again.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``No, no; I shan't hurt myself. I'd sooner speak to you now, if you don't
mind. I've asked Mary to tell the Doctor that you are with me, so you
needn't go down to calling-over; and I mayn't have another chance, for
I shall most likely have to go home for change of air to get well, and
mayn't come back this half.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Oh, do you think you must go away before the end of the half? I'm
so sorry. It's more than five weeks yet to the holidays, and all the
fifth-form examination and half the cricket-matches to come yet. And
what shall I do all that time alone in our study? Why, Arthur, it will
be more than twelve weeks before I see you again. Oh, hang it, I can't
stand that! Besides who's to keep me up to working at the examination
books? I shall come out bottom of the form, as sure as eggs is eggs.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Tom/Brown/Tom Brown</b></font>)</div><p/>Tom was rattling on, half in joke, half in earnest, for he (<font color='blue'><b>Tom</b></font>) wanted to
get Arthur out of his (<font color='blue'><b>Arthur</b></font>) serious vein, thinking it would do him (<font color='blue'><b>Arthur</b></font>) harm; but
Arthur broke in,--

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Oh, please, Tom, stop, or you'll drive all I had to say out of my head.
And I'm already horribly afraid I'm going to make you angry.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Arthur/George/George Arthur</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Don't gammon, young un,''  (<font color='red'><b>Tom/Brown/Tom Brown</b></font>)</div>rejoined Tom -LRB-the use of the old name, dear to
him (<font color='blue'><b>Tom</b></font>) from old recollections, made Arthur start and smile and feel quite
happy-RRB-; <div class="bookquote">``you know you ain't afraid, and you've never made me angry since
the first month we chummed together. Now I'm going to be quite sober for
a quarter of an hour, which is more than I am once in a year; so make
the most of it; heave ahead, and pitch into me right and left.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Arthur/George/George Arthur</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Dear Tom, I ain't going to pitch into you,''  (<font color='red'><b>Arthur/George/George Arthur</b></font>)</div>said Arthur piteously; <div class="bookquote">``and
it seems so cocky in me to be advising you, who've been my backbone ever
since I've been at Rugby, and have made the school a paradise to me. Ah,
I see I shall never do it, unless I go head over heels at once, as
you said when you taught me to swim. Tom, I want you to give up using
vulgus-books and cribs.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Arthur/George/George Arthur</b></font>)</div><p/>Arthur sank back on to his (<font color='blue'><b>Arthur</b></font>) pillow with a sigh, as if the effort had been
great; but the worst was now over, and he (<font color='blue'><b>Arthur</b></font>) looked straight at Tom, who
was evidently taken aback. He (<font color='blue'><b>Tom</b></font>) leant his (<font color='blue'><b>Tom</b></font>) elbows on his (<font color='blue'><b>Tom</b></font>) knees, and stuck
his (<font color='blue'><b>Tom</b></font>) hands into his (<font color='blue'><b>Tom</b></font>) hair, whistled a verse of <div class="bookquote">``Billy Taylor,''  (<font color='red'><b>He</b></font>)</div>and then
was quite silent for another minute. Not a shade crossed his (<font color='blue'><b>Tom</b></font>) face,
but he (<font color='blue'><b>Tom</b></font>) was clearly puzzled. At last he (<font color='blue'><b>Tom</b></font>) looked up, and caught Arthur's
anxious look, took his (<font color='blue'><b>Arthur</b></font>) hand, and said simply,--

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Why, young un?''

 (<font color='red'><b>Arthur/George/George Arthur</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Because you're the honestest boy in Rugby, and that ain't honest.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I don't see that.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``What were you sent to Rugby for?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Well, I don't know exactly--nobody ever told me. I suppose because all
boys are sent to a public school in England.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``But what do you think yourself? What do you want to do here, and to
carry away?''

 (<font color='red'><b>Tom/Brown/Tom Brown</b></font>)</div><p/>Tom thought a minute. <div class="bookquote">``I want to be A1 at cricket and football, and all
the other games, and to make my hands keep my head against any fellow,
lout or gentleman. I want to get into the sixth before I leave, and to
please the Doctor; and I want to carry away just as much Latin and Greek
as will take me through Oxford respectably. There, now, young un; I
never thought of it before, but that's pretty much about my figure.
Ain't it all on the square? What have you got to say to that?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Why, that you are pretty sure to do all that you want, then.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Well, I hope so. But you've forgot one thing--what I want to leave
behind me. I want to leave behind me,''  (<font color='red'><b>Tom/Brown/Tom Brown</b></font>)</div>said Tom, speaking slow, and
looking much moved, <div class="bookquote">``the name of a fellow who never bullied a little
boy, or turned his (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>) back on a big one.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Tom/Brown/Tom Brown</b></font>)</div><p/>Arthur pressed his (<font color='blue'><b>Arthur</b></font>) hand, and after a moment's silence went on, <div class="bookquote">``You say,
Tom, you want to please the Doctor. Now, do you want to please him (<font color='blue'><b>Tom</b></font>) by
what he (<font color='blue'><b>Tom</b></font>) thinks you do, or by what you really do?''

 (<font color='red'><b>Arthur/George/George Arthur</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``By what I really do, of course.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Does he (<font color='blue'><b>Tom</b></font>) think you use cribs and vulgus-books?''

 (<font color='red'><b>Tom/Brown/Tom Brown</b></font>)</div><p/>Tom felt at once that his (<font color='blue'><b>Tom</b></font>) flank was turned, but he (<font color='blue'><b>Tom</b></font>) couldn't give in. <div class="bookquote">``He (<font color='blue'><b>Tom</b></font>)
was at Winchester himself,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>said he (<font color='blue'><b>Tom</b></font>); <div class="bookquote">``he (<font color='blue'><b>Tom</b></font>) knows all about it.''

 (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Yes; but does he (<font color='blue'><b>Tom</b></font>) think you use them? Do you think he (<font color='blue'><b>Tom</b></font>) approves of it?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``You young villain!''  (<font color='red'><b>Tom/Brown/Tom Brown</b></font>)</div>said Tom, shaking his (<font color='blue'><b>Tom</b></font>) fist at Arthur, half vexed
and half pleased, <div class="bookquote">``I never think about it. Hang it! there, perhaps he (<font color='blue'><b>Tom</b></font>)
don't. Well, I suppose he (<font color='blue'><b>Tom</b></font>) don't.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Arthur/George/George Arthur</b></font>)</div><p/>Arthur saw that he (<font color='blue'><b>Arthur</b></font>) had got his (<font color='blue'><b>Arthur</b></font>) point; he (<font color='blue'><b>Arthur</b></font>) knew his (<font color='blue'><b>Arthur</b></font>) friend well, and was
wise in silence as in speech. He (<font color='blue'><b>Arthur</b></font>) only said, <div class="bookquote">``I would sooner have the
doctor's good opinion of me as I really am than any man's in the world.''

 (<font color='red'><b>He</b></font>)</div><p/>After another minute, Tom began again, <div class="bookquote">``Look here, young un. How on
earth am I to get time to play the matches this half if I give up cribs?
We're in the middle of that long crabbed chorus in the Agamemnon. I can
only just make head or tail of it with the crib. Then there's Pericles's
speech coming on in Thucydides, and `The Birds' to get up for the
examination, besides the Tacitus.''  (<font color='red'><b>Tom/Brown/Tom Brown</b></font>)</div>Tom groaned at the thought of his (<font color='blue'><b>Tom</b></font>)
accumulated labours. <div class="bookquote">``I say, young un, there's only five weeks or so
left to holidays. Mayn't I go on as usual for this half? I'll tell the
Doctor about it some day, or you may.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Arthur/George/George Arthur</b></font>)</div><p/>Arthur looked out of the window. The twilight had come on, and all was
silent. He (<font color='blue'><b>Arthur</b></font>) repeated in a low voice: <div class="bookquote">``In this thing the Lord pardon thy
servant, that when my master goeth into the house of Rimmon to worship
there, and he (<font color='blue'><b>master</b></font>) leaneth on my hand, and I bow down myself in the house of
Rimmon, when I bow down myself in the house of Rimmon, the Lord pardon
thy servant in this thing.''

 (<font color='red'><b>He</b></font>)</div><p/>Not a word more was said on the subject, and the boys were again
silent--one of those blessed, short silences in which the resolves which
colour a life are so often taken.

<p/>Tom was the first to break it. <div class="bookquote">``You've been very ill indeed, haven't
you, Geordie?''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>said he (<font color='blue'><b>Tom</b></font>), with a mixture of awe and curiosity, feeling as
if his (<font color='blue'><b>Tom</b></font>) friend had been in some strange place or scene, of which he (<font color='blue'><b>Tom</b></font>) could
form no idea, and full of the memory of his (<font color='blue'><b>Tom</b></font>) own thoughts during the last
week.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Yes, very. I'm sure the Doctor thought I was going to die. He (<font color='blue'><b>Doctor</b></font>) gave me
the Sacrament last Sunday, and you can't think what he (<font color='blue'><b>Doctor</b></font>) is when one is
ill. He (<font color='blue'><b>Doctor</b></font>) said such brave, and tender, and gentle things to me, I felt
quite light and strong after it, and never had any more fear. My mother
brought our old medical man, who attended me when I was a poor sickly
child. He (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) said my constitution was quite changed, and that I'm fit for
anything now. If it hadn't, I couldn't have stood three days of this
illness. That's all thanks to you, and the games you've made me fond
of.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``More thanks to old Martin,''  (<font color='red'><b>Tom/Brown/Tom Brown</b></font>)</div>said Tom; <div class="bookquote">``he (<font color='blue'><b>Martin</b></font>)'s been your real friend.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Tom/Brown/Tom Brown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Nonsense, Tom; he (<font color='blue'><b>Tom</b></font>) never could have done for me what you have.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Well, I don't know; I did little enough. Did they tell you--you won't
mind hearing it now, I know--that poor Thompson died last week? The
other three boys are getting quite round, like you.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Oh yes, I heard of it.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Tom/Brown/Tom Brown</b></font>)</div><p/>Then Tom, who was quite full of it, told Arthur of the burial-service
in the chapel, and how it had impressed him (<font color='blue'><b>Tom</b></font>), and, he (<font color='blue'><b>Tom</b></font>) believed, all the
other boys. <div class="bookquote">``And though the Doctor never said a word about it,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>said he (<font color='blue'><b>Tom</b></font>),
<div class="bookquote">``and it was a half-holiday and match-day, there wasn't a game played in
the close all the afternoon, and the boys all went about as if it were
Sunday.''

 (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I'm very glad of it,''  (<font color='red'><b>Arthur/George/George Arthur</b></font>)</div>said Arthur. <div class="bookquote">``But, Tom, I've had such strange
thoughts about death lately. I've never told a soul of them, not even my
mother. Sometimes I think they're wrong, but, do you know, I don't think
in my heart I could be sorry at the death of any of my friends.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Tom/Brown/Tom Brown</b></font>)</div><p/>Tom was taken quite aback. <div class="bookquote">``What in the world is the young un after
now?''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>thought he (<font color='blue'><b>Tom</b></font>); <div class="bookquote">``I've swallowed a good many of his (<font color='blue'><b>Tom</b></font>) crotchets, but this
altogether beats me. He (<font color='blue'><b>Tom</b></font>) can't be quite right in his (<font color='blue'><b>Tom</b></font>) head.''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>He (<font color='blue'><b>Tom</b></font>) didn't
want to say a word, and shifted about uneasily in the dark; however,
Arthur seemed to be waiting for an answer, so at last he (<font color='blue'><b>Arthur</b></font>) said, <div class="bookquote">``I don't
think I quite see what you mean, Geordie. One's told so often to think
about death that I've tried it on sometimes, especially this last week.
But we won't talk of it now. I'd better go. You're getting tired, and I
shall do you harm.''

 (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``No, no; indeed I ain't, Tom. You must stop till nine; there's only
twenty minutes. I've settled you shall stop till nine. And oh! do let me
talk to you--I must talk to you. I see it's just as I feared. You think
I'm half mad. Don't you, now?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Well, I did think it odd what you said, Geordie, as you ask me.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Arthur/George/George Arthur</b></font>)</div><p/>Arthur paused a moment, and then said quickly, <div class="bookquote">``I'll tell you how it all
happened. At first, when I was sent to the sick-room, and found I had
really got the fever, I was terribly frightened. I thought I should
die, and I could not face it for a moment. I don't think it was sheer
cowardice at first, but I thought how hard it was to be taken away from
my mother and sisters and you all, just as I was beginning to see my way
to many things, and to feel that I might be a man and do a man's work.
To die without having fought, and worked, and given one's life away,
was too hard to bear. I got terribly impatient, and accused God of
injustice, and strove to justify myself. And the harder I strove the
deeper I sank. Then the image of my dear father often came across me,
but I turned from it. Whenever it came, a heavy, numbing throb seemed to
take hold of my heart, and say, `Dead-dead-dead.' And I cried out, `The
living, the living shall praise Thee, O God; the dead cannot praise
thee. There is no work in the grave; in the night no man can work. But
I can work. I can do great things. I will do great things. Why wilt thou
slay me?' And so I struggled and plunged, deeper and deeper, and went
down into a living black tomb. I was alone there, with no power to stir
or think; alone with myself; beyond the reach of all human fellowship;
beyond Christ's reach, I thought, in my nightmare. You, who are brave
and bright and strong, can have no idea of that agony. Pray to God you
never may. Pray as for your life.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Arthur/George/George Arthur</b></font>)</div><p/>Arthur stopped--from exhaustion, Tom thought; but what between his (<font color='blue'><b>Tom</b></font>) fear
lest Arthur should hurt himself, his (<font color='blue'><b>Tom</b></font>) awe, and his (<font color='blue'><b>Tom</b></font>) longing for him (<font color='blue'><b>Tom</b></font>) to go
on, he (<font color='blue'><b>Tom</b></font>) couldn't ask, or stir to help him (<font color='blue'><b>Tom</b></font>).

<p/>Presently he (<font color='blue'><b>Tom</b></font>) went on, but quite calm and slow. <div class="bookquote">``I don't know how long
I was in that state--for more than a day, I know; for I was quite
conscious, and lived my outer life all the time, and took my medicines,
and spoke to my mother, and heard what they said. But I didn't take much
note of time. I thought time was over for me, and that that tomb was
what was beyond. Well, on last Sunday morning, as I seemed to lie in
that tomb, alone, as I thought, for ever and ever, the black, dead wall
was cleft in two, and I was caught up and borne through into the light
by some great power, some living, mighty spirit. Tom, do you remember
the living creatures and the wheels in Ezekiel? It was just like that.
`When they went, I heard the noise of their wings, like the noise of
great waters, as the voice of the Almighty, the voice of speech, as the
noise of an host; when they stood, they let down their wings.' `And
they went every one straight forward: whither the spirit was to go, they
went; and they turned not when they went.' And we rushed through the
bright air, which was full of myriads of living creatures, and paused
on the brink of a great river. And the power held me up, and I knew that
that great river was the grave, and death dwelt there, but not the death
I had met in the black tomb. That, I felt, was gone for ever. For on the
other bank of the great river I saw men and women and children rising up
pure and bright, and the tears were wiped from their eyes, and they put
on glory and strength, and all weariness and pain fell away. And beyond
were a multitude which no man could number, and they worked at some
great work; and they who rose from the river went on and joined in the
work. They all worked, and each worked in a different way, but all at
the same work. And I saw there my father, and the men in the old town
whom I knew when I was a child--many a hard, stern man, who never came
to church, and whom they called atheist and infidel. There they were,
side by side with my father, whom I had seen toil and die for them, and
women and little children, and the seal was on the foreheads of all. And
I longed to see what the work was, and could not; so I tried to plunge
in the river, for I thought I would join them, but I could not. Then I
looked about to see how they got into the river. And this I could not
see, but I saw myriads on this side, and they too worked, and I knew
that it was the same work, and the same seal was on their foreheads. And
though I saw that there was toil and anguish in the work of these, and
that most that were working were blind and feeble, yet I longed no more
to plunge into the river, but more and more to know what the work was.
And as I looked I saw my mother and my sisters, and I saw the Doctor,
and you, Tom, and hundreds more whom I knew; and at last I saw myself
too, and I was toiling and doing ever so little a piece of the great
work. Then it all melted away, and the power left me, and as it left
me I thought I heard a voice say, `The vision is for an appointed time;
though it tarry, wait for it, for in the end it shall speak and not lie,
it shall surely come, it shall not tarry.' It was early morning I know,
then--it was so quiet and cool, and my mother was fast asleep in the
chair by my bedside; but it wasn't only a dream of mine. I know it
wasn't a dream. Then I fell into a deep sleep, and only woke after
afternoon chapel; and the Doctor came and gave me the Sacrament, as I
told you. I told him (<font color='blue'><b>Doctor</b></font>) and my mother I should get well--I knew I should;
but I couldn't tell them why. Tom,''  (<font color='red'><b>Arthur/George/George Arthur</b></font>)</div>said Arthur gently, after another
minute, <div class="bookquote">``do you see why I could not grieve now to see my dearest friend
die? It can't be--it isn't--all fever or illness. God would never have
let me see it so clear if it wasn't true. I don't understand it all yet;
it will take me my life and longer to do that--to find out what the work
is.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Arthur/George/George Arthur</b></font>)</div><p/>When Arthur stopped there was a long pause. Tom could not speak; he (<font color='blue'><b>Tom</b></font>) was
almost afraid to breathe, lest he (<font color='blue'><b>Tom</b></font>) should break the train of Arthur's
thoughts. He (<font color='blue'><b>Arthur</b></font>) longed to hear more, and to ask questions. In another
minute nine o’clock struck, and a gentle tap at the door called them
both back into the world again. They did not answer, however, for a
moment; and so the door opened, and a lady came in carrying a candle.

<p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) went straight to the sofa, and took hold of Arthur's hand, and then
stooped down and kissed him (<font color='blue'><b>Arthur</b></font>).

<p/><div class="bookquote">``My dearest boy, you feel a little feverish again. Why didn't you have
lights? You've talked too much, and excited yourself in the dark.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Oh no, mother; you can't think how well I feel. I shall start with
you to-morrow for Devonshire. But, mother, here's my friend--here's Tom
Brown. You know him (<font color='blue'><b>Brown</b></font>)?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Yes, indeed; I've known him (<font color='blue'><b>Brown</b></font>) for years,''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) said, and held out her (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>)
hand to Tom, who was now standing up behind the sofa. This was Arthur's
mother: tall and slight and fair, with masses of golden hair drawn back
from the broad, white forehead, and the calm blue eye meeting his (<font color='blue'><b>Arthur</b></font>) so
deep and open--the eye that he (<font color='blue'><b>Arthur</b></font>) knew so well, for it was his (<font color='blue'><b>Arthur</b></font>) friend's
over again, and the lovely, tender mouth that trembled while he (<font color='blue'><b>Arthur</b></font>)
looked--she (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) stood there, a woman of thirty-eight, old enough to be his (<font color='blue'><b>Arthur</b></font>)
mother, and one whose face showed the lines which must be written on the
faces of good men's wives and widows, but he (<font color='blue'><b>Arthur</b></font>) thought he (<font color='blue'><b>Arthur</b></font>) had never seen
anything so beautiful. He (<font color='blue'><b>Arthur</b></font>) couldn't help wondering if Arthur's sisters
were like her (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>).

<p/>Tom held her (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) hand, and looked on straight in her (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) face; he (<font color='blue'><b>Tom</b></font>) could neither
let it go nor speak.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Now, Tom,''  (<font color='red'><b>Arthur/George/George Arthur</b></font>)</div>said Arthur, laughing, <div class="bookquote">``where are your manners? You'll stare
my mother out of countenance.''  (<font color='red'><b>Arthur/George/George Arthur</b></font>)</div>Tom dropped the little hand with a sigh.
<div class="bookquote">``There, sit down, both of you.--Here, dearest mother; there's room
here.''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>And he (<font color='blue'><b>Tom</b></font>) made a place on the sofa for her (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>).--<div class="bookquote">``Tom, you needn't go;
I'm sure you won't be called up at first lesson.''  (<font color='red'><b>Tom/Brown/Tom Brown</b></font>)</div>Tom felt that he (<font color='blue'><b>Tom</b></font>)
would risk being floored at every lesson for the rest of his (<font color='blue'><b>Tom</b></font>) natural
school-life sooner than go, so sat down. <div class="bookquote">``And now,''  (<font color='red'><b>Arthur/George/George Arthur</b></font>)</div>said Arthur, <div class="bookquote">``I have
realized one of the dearest wishes of my life--to see you two together.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Arthur/George/George Arthur</b></font>)</div><p/>And then he (<font color='blue'><b>Arthur</b></font>) led away the talk to their home in Devonshire, and the
red, bright earth, and the deep green combes, and the peat streams like
cairngorm pebbles, and the wild moor with its high, cloudy tors for a
giant background to the picture, till Tom got jealous, and stood up for
the clear chalk streams, and the emerald water meadows and great elms
and willows of the dear old royal county, as he (<font color='blue'><b>royal</b></font>) gloried to call it. And
the mother sat on quiet and loving, rejoicing in their life. The quarter
to ten struck, and the bell rang for bed, before they had well begun
their talk, as it seemed.

<p/>Then Tom rose with a sigh to go.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Shall I see you in the morning, Geordie?''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>said he (<font color='blue'><b>Tom</b></font>), as he (<font color='blue'><b>Tom</b></font>) shook his (<font color='blue'><b>Tom</b></font>)
friend's hand. <div class="bookquote">``Never mind, though; you'll be back next half. And I
shan't forget the house of Rimmon.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Arthur/George/George Arthur</b></font>)</div><p/>Arthur's mother got up and walked with him (<font color='blue'><b>Arthur</b></font>) to the door, and there gave
him (<font color='blue'><b>Arthur</b></font>) her (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) hand again; and again his (<font color='blue'><b>Arthur</b></font>) eyes met that deep, loving look, which
was like a spell upon him (<font color='blue'><b>Arthur</b></font>). Her (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) voice trembled slightly as she (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) said,
<div class="bookquote">``Good-night. You are one who knows what our Father has promised to the
friend of the widow and the fatherless. May He (<font color='blue'><b>friend</b></font>) deal with you as you have
dealt with me and mine!''

 (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div><p/>Tom was quite upset; he (<font color='blue'><b>Tom</b></font>) mumbled something about owing everything good in
him (<font color='blue'><b>Tom</b></font>) to Geordie, looked in her (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) face again, pressed her (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) hand to his (<font color='blue'><b>Tom</b></font>) lips,
and rushed downstairs to his (<font color='blue'><b>Tom</b></font>) study, where he (<font color='blue'><b>Tom</b></font>) sat till old Thomas came
kicking at the door, to tell him (<font color='blue'><b>Tom</b></font>) his (<font color='blue'><b>Tom</b></font>) allowance would be stopped if he (<font color='blue'><b>Tom</b></font>)
didn't go off to bed. -LRB-It would have been stopped anyhow, but that he (<font color='blue'><b>Tom</b></font>)
was a great favourite with the old gentleman, who loved to come out in
the afternoons into the close to Tom's wicket, and bowl slow twisters to
him (<font color='blue'><b>Tom</b></font>), and talk of the glories of bygone Surrey heroes, with whom he (<font color='blue'><b>Tom</b></font>)
had played former generations.-RRB- So Tom roused himself, and took up
his (<font color='blue'><b>Tom</b></font>) candle to go to bed; and then for the first time was aware of
a beautiful new fishing-rod, with old Eton's mark on it, and a
splendidly-bound Bible, which lay on his (<font color='blue'><b>Tom</b></font>) table, on the title-page
of which was written--<div class="bookquote">``TOM BROWN, from his (<font color='blue'><b>BROWN</b></font>) affectionate and grateful
friends, Frances Jane Arthur; George Arthur.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Tom/Brown/Tom Brown</b></font>)</div><p/>I leave you all to guess how he (<font color='blue'><b>Tom</b></font>) slept, and what he (<font color='blue'><b>Tom</b></font>) dreamt of.



<p/>CHAPTER VII--HARRY EAST'S DILEMMAS AND DELIVERANCES.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``The Holy Supper is kept indeed,
In whatso we share with another's need
Not that which we give, but what we share,
For the gift without the giver is bare.
Who bestows himself with his (<font color='blue'><b>giver</b></font>) alms feeds three,
Himself, his (<font color='blue'><b>giver</b></font>) hungering neighbour and Me.''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>--LOWELL, The Vision of Sir Launfal.

<p/>The next morning, after breakfast, Tom, East, and Gower met as usual
to learn their second lesson together. Tom had been considering how to
break his (<font color='blue'><b>Tom</b></font>) proposal of giving up the crib to the others, and having found
no better way -LRB-as indeed none better can ever be found by man or boy-RRB-,
told them simply what had happened; how he (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>) had been to see Arthur, who
had talked to him (<font color='blue'><b>Arthur</b></font>) upon the subject, and what he (<font color='blue'><b>Arthur</b></font>) had said, and for his (<font color='blue'><b>Arthur</b></font>)
part he (<font color='blue'><b>Arthur</b></font>) had made up his (<font color='blue'><b>Arthur</b></font>) mind, and wasn't going to use cribs any more;
and not being quite sure of his (<font color='blue'><b>Arthur</b></font>) ground, took the high and pathetic tone,
and was proceeding to say <div class="bookquote">``how that, having learnt his (<font color='blue'><b>giver</b></font>) lessons with
them for so many years, it would grieve him (<font color='blue'><b>giver</b></font>) much to put an end to the
arrangement, and he (<font color='blue'><b>giver</b></font>) hoped, at any rate, that if they wouldn't go on
with him (<font color='blue'><b>giver</b></font>), they should still be just as good friends, and respect one
another's motives; but--''

 (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div><p/>Here the other boys, who had been listening with open eyes and ears,
burst in,--

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Stuff and nonsense!''  (<font color='red'><b>the boys burst</b></font>)</div>cried Gower. <div class="bookquote">``Here, East, get down the crib and
find the place.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``O Tommy, Tommy!''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>said East, proceeding to do as he (<font color='blue'><b>Gower</b></font>) was bidden, <div class="bookquote">``that it
should ever have come to this! I knew Arthur'd be the ruin of you some
day, and you of me. And now the time's come.''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>And he (<font color='blue'><b>Gower</b></font>) made a doleful
face.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``I don't know about ruin,''  (<font color='red'><b>Tom/Brown/Tom Brown</b></font>)</div>answered Tom; <div class="bookquote">``I know that you and I would
have had the sack long ago if it hadn't been for him (<font color='blue'><b>Arthur</b></font>). And you know it as
well as I.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Tom/Brown/Tom Brown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Well, we were in a baddish way before he (<font color='blue'><b>Arthur</b></font>) came, I own; but this new
crotchet of his (<font color='blue'><b>Arthur</b></font>) is past a joke.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Let's give it a trial, Harry; come. You know how often he (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) has been
right and we wrong.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Now, don't you two be jawing away about young Square-toes,''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>struck in
Gower. <div class="bookquote">``He (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>)'s no end of a sucking wiseacre, I dare say; but we've no time
to lose, and I've got the fives court at half-past nine.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I say, Gower,''  (<font color='red'><b>Tom/Brown/Tom Brown</b></font>)</div>said Tom appealingly, <div class="bookquote">``be a good fellow, and let's try
if we can't get on without the crib.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Tom/Brown/Tom Brown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``What! in this chorus? Why, we shan't get through ten lines.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I say, Tom,''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>cried East, having hit on a new idea, <div class="bookquote">``don't you remember,
when we were in the upper fourth, and old Momus caught me construing
off the leaf of a crib which I'd torn out and put in my book, and which
would float out on to the floor, he (<font color='blue'><b>Tom</b></font>) sent me up to be flogged for it?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Yes, I remember it very well.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Well, the Doctor, after he (<font color='blue'><b>Doctor</b></font>)'d flogged me, told me himself that he (<font color='blue'><b>Doctor</b></font>) didn't
flog me for using a translation, but for taking it in to lesson, and
using it there when I hadn't learnt a word before I came in. He (<font color='blue'><b>Doctor</b></font>) said
there was no harm in using a translation to get a clue to hard passages,
if you tried all you could first to make them out without.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Did he (<font color='blue'><b>Doctor</b></font>), though?''  (<font color='red'><b>Tom/Brown/Tom Brown</b></font>)</div>said Tom; <div class="bookquote">``then Arthur must be wrong.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Tom/Brown/Tom Brown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Of course he (<font color='blue'><b>Arthur</b></font>) is,''  (<font color='red'><b>Gower</b></font>)</div>said Gower--<div class="bookquote">``the little prig. We'll only use the crib
when we can't construe without it.--Go ahead, East.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Gower</b></font>)</div><p/>And on this agreement they started--Tom, satisfied with having made his (<font color='blue'><b>Tom</b></font>)
confession, and not sorry to have a locus penitentiae, and not to be
deprived altogether of the use of his (<font color='blue'><b>Tom</b></font>) old and faithful friend.

<p/>The boys went on as usual, each taking a sentence in turn, and the crib
being handed to the one whose turn it was to construe. Of course
Tom couldn't object to this, as, was it not simply lying there to be
appealed to in case the sentence should prove too hard altogether for
the construer? But it must be owned that Gower and East did not make
very tremendous exertions to conquer their sentences before having
recourse to its help. Tom, however, with the most heroic virtue and
gallantry, rushed into his (<font color='blue'><b>Tom</b></font>) sentence, searching in a high-minded manner
for nominative and verb, and turning over his (<font color='blue'><b>Tom</b></font>) dictionary frantically for
the first hard word that stopped him (<font color='blue'><b>Tom</b></font>). But in the meantime Gower, who
was bent on getting to fives, would peep quietly into the crib, and then
suggest, <div class="bookquote">``Don't you think this is the meaning?''  (<font color='red'><b>Gower</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``I think you must take
it this way, Brown.''  (<font color='red'><b>Tom/Brown/Tom Brown</b></font>)</div>And as Tom didn't see his (<font color='blue'><b>Tom</b></font>) way to not profiting by
these suggestions, the lesson went on about as quickly as usual, and
Gower was able to start for the fives court within five minutes of the
half-hour.

<p/>When Tom and East were left face to face, they looked at one another for
a minute, Tom puzzled, and East chokefull of fun, and then burst into a
roar of laughter.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Well, Tom,''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>said East, recovering himself, <div class="bookquote">``I don t see any objection
to the new way. It's about as good as the old one, I think, besides the
advantage it gives one of feeling virtuous, and looking down on one's
neighbours.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Tom/Brown/Tom Brown</b></font>)</div><p/>Tom shoved his (<font color='blue'><b>Tom</b></font>) hand into his (<font color='blue'><b>Tom</b></font>) back hair. <div class="bookquote">``I ain't so sure,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>said he (<font color='blue'><b>Tom</b></font>); <div class="bookquote">``you
two fellows carried me off my legs. I don't think we really tried one
sentence fairly. Are you sure you remember what the Doctor said to you?''

 (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Yes. And I'll swear I couldn't make out one of my sentences to-day--no,
nor ever could. I really don't remember,''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>said East, speaking slowly and
impressively, <div class="bookquote">``to have come across one Latin or Greek sentence this half
that I could go and construe by the light of nature. Whereby I am sure
Providence intended cribs to be used.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``The thing to find out,''  (<font color='red'><b>Tom/Brown/Tom Brown</b></font>)</div>said Tom meditatively, <div class="bookquote">``is how long one ought
to grind at a sentence without looking at the crib. Now I think if one
fairly looks out all the words one don't know, and then can't hit it,
that's enough.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Tom/Brown/Tom Brown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``To be sure, Tommy,''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>said East demurely, but with a merry twinkle in his (<font color='blue'><b>Tom</b></font>)
eye. <div class="bookquote">``Your new doctrine too, old fellow,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>added he (<font color='blue'><b>Tom</b></font>), <div class="bookquote">``when one comes to
think of it, is a cutting at the root of all school morality. You'll
take away mutual help, brotherly love, or, in the vulgar tongue, giving
construes, which I hold to be one of our highest virtues. For how can
you distinguish between getting a construe from another boy and using a
crib? Hang it, Tom, if you're going to deprive all our school-fellows
of the chance of exercising Christian benevolence and being good
Samaritans, I shall cut the concern.''

 (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I wish you wouldn't joke about it, Harry; it's hard enough to see one's
way--a precious sight harder than I thought last night. But I suppose
there's a use and an abuse of both, and one'll get straight enough
somehow. But you can't make out, anyhow, that one has a right to use old
vulgus-books and copy-books.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Hullo, more heresy! How fast a fellow goes downhill when he (<font color='blue'><b>fellow</b></font>) once gets
his (<font color='blue'><b>fellow</b></font>) head before his (<font color='blue'><b>fellow</b></font>) legs. Listen to me, Tom. Not use old vulgus-books!
Why, you Goth, ain't we to take the benefit of the wisdom and admire and
use the work of past generations? Not use old copy-books! Why, you
might as well say we ought to pull down Westminster Abbey, and put up a
go-to-meeting shop with churchwarden windows; or never read Shakespeare,
but only Sheridan Knowles. Think of all the work and labour that our
predecessors have bestowed on these very books; and are we to make their
work of no value?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I say, Harry, please don't chaff; I'm really serious.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``And then, is it not our duty to consult the pleasure of others rather
than our own, and above all, that of our masters? Fancy, then, the
difference to them in looking over a vulgus which has been carefully
touched and retouched by themselves and others, and which must bring
them a sort of dreamy pleasure, as if they'd met the thought
or expression of it somewhere or another--before they were born
perhaps--and that of cutting up, and making picture-frames round all
your and my false quantities, and other monstrosities. Why, Tom, you
wouldn't be so cruel as never to let old Momus hum over the `O genus
humanum' again, and then look up doubtingly through his (<font color='blue'><b>Tom</b></font>) spectacles, and
end by smiling and giving three extra marks for it--just for old sake's
sake, I suppose.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Well,''  (<font color='red'><b>Tom/Brown/Tom Brown</b></font>)</div>said Tom, getting up in something as like a huff as he (<font color='blue'><b>Tom</b></font>) was
capable of, <div class="bookquote">``it's deuced hard that when a fellow's really trying to do
what he (<font color='blue'><b>fellow</b></font>) ought, his (<font color='blue'><b>fellow</b></font>) best friends'll do nothing but chaff him (<font color='blue'><b>fellow</b></font>) and try to
put him (<font color='blue'><b>fellow</b></font>) down.''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>And he (<font color='blue'><b>Tom</b></font>) stuck his (<font color='blue'><b>Tom</b></font>) books under his (<font color='blue'><b>Tom</b></font>) arm and his (<font color='blue'><b>Tom</b></font>) hat on his (<font color='blue'><b>Tom</b></font>)
head, preparatory to rushing out into the quadrangle, to testify with
his (<font color='blue'><b>Tom</b></font>) own soul of the faithlessness of friendships.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Now don't be an ass, Tom,''  (<font color='red'><b>him</b></font>)</div>said East, catching hold of him (<font color='blue'><b>Tom</b></font>); <div class="bookquote">``you know
me well enough by this time; my bark's worse than my bite. You can't
expect to ride your new crotchet without anybody's trying to stick a
nettle under his (<font color='blue'><b>Tom</b></font>) tail and make him (<font color='blue'><b>Tom</b></font>) kick you off--especially as we shall
all have to go on foot still. But now sit down, and let's go over it
again. I'll be as serious as a judge.''

 (<font color='red'><b>him</b></font>)</div><p/>Then Tom sat himself down on the table, and waxed eloquent about all the
righteousnesses and advantages of the new plan, as was his (<font color='blue'><b>Tom</b></font>) wont whenever
he (<font color='blue'><b>Tom</b></font>) took up anything, going into it as if his (<font color='blue'><b>Tom</b></font>) life depended upon it, and
sparing no abuse which he (<font color='blue'><b>Tom</b></font>) could think of, of the opposite method, which
he (<font color='blue'><b>Tom</b></font>) denounced as ungentlemanly, cowardly, mean, lying, and no one knows
what besides. <div class="bookquote">``Very cool of Tom,''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>as East thought, but didn't say,
<div class="bookquote">``seeing as how he (<font color='blue'><b>Tom</b></font>) only came out of Egypt himself last night at bedtime.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Well, Tom,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>said he (<font color='blue'><b>Tom</b></font>) at last, <div class="bookquote">``you see, when you and I came to school
there were none of these sort of notions. You may be right--I dare say
you are. Only what one has always felt about the masters is, that it's
a fair trial of skill and last between us and them--like a match at
football or a battle. We're natural enemies in school--that's the fact.
We've got to learn so much Latin and Greek, and do so many verses, and
they've got to see that we do it. If we can slip the collar and do so
much less without getting caught, that's one to us. If they can get more
out of us, or catch us shirking, that's one to them. All's fair in war
but lying. If I run my luck against theirs, and go into school without
looking at my lessons, and don't get called up, why am I a snob or a
sneak? I don't tell the master I've learnt it. He (<font color='blue'><b>master</b></font>)'s got to find out
whether I have or not. What's he (<font color='blue'><b>master</b></font>) paid for? If he (<font color='blue'><b>master</b></font>) calls me up and I get
floored, he (<font color='blue'><b>master</b></font>) makes me write it out in Greek and English. Very good. He (<font color='blue'><b>master</b></font>)'s
caught me, and I don't grumble. I grant you, if I go and snivel to him (<font color='blue'><b>master</b></font>),
and tell him (<font color='blue'><b>master</b></font>) I've really tried to learn it, but found it so hard without
a translation, or say I've had a toothache, or any humbug of that kind,
I'm a snob. That's my school morality; it's served me, and you too, Tom,
for the matter of that, these five years. And it's all clear and fair,
no mistake about it. We understand it, and they understand it, and I
don't know what we're to come to with any other.''

 (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div><p/>Tom looked at him (<font color='blue'><b>Tom</b></font>) pleased and a little puzzled. He (<font color='blue'><b>Tom</b></font>) had never heard
East speak his (<font color='blue'><b>Tom</b></font>) mind seriously before, and couldn't help feeling how
completely he (<font color='blue'><b>Tom</b></font>) had hit his (<font color='blue'><b>Tom</b></font>) own theory and practice up to that time.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Thank you, old fellow,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>said he (<font color='blue'><b>Tom</b></font>). <div class="bookquote">``You're a good old brick to be
serious, and not put out with me. I said more than I meant, I dare say,
only you see I know I'm right. Whatever you and Gower and the rest do, I
shall hold on. I must. And as it's all new and an uphill game, you see,
one must hit hard and hold on tight at first.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Very good,''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>said East; <div class="bookquote">``hold on and hit away, only don't hit under the
line.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``But I must bring you over, Harry, or I shan't be comfortable. Now, I'll
allow all you've said. We've always been honourable enemies with the
masters. We found a state of war when we came, and went into it of
course. Only don't you think things are altered a good deal? I don't
feel as I used to the masters. They seem to me to treat one quite
differently.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Yes, perhaps they do,''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>said East; <div class="bookquote">``there's a new set you see, mostly,
who don't feel sure of themselves yet. They don't want to fight till
they know the ground.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I don't think it's only that,''  (<font color='red'><b>Tom/Brown/Tom Brown</b></font>)</div>said Tom. <div class="bookquote">``And then the Doctor, he (<font color='blue'><b>Doctor</b></font>) does
treat one so openly, and like a gentleman, and as if one was working
with him (<font color='blue'><b>Doctor</b></font>).''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Well, so he (<font color='blue'><b>Doctor</b></font>) does,''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>said East; <div class="bookquote">``he (<font color='blue'><b>Doctor</b></font>)'s a splendid fellow, and when I get
into the sixth I shall act accordingly. Only you know he (<font color='blue'><b>Doctor</b></font>) has nothing to
do with our lessons now, except examining us. I say, though,''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>looking at
his (<font color='blue'><b>Tom</b></font>) watch, <div class="bookquote">``it's just the quarter. Come along.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Arthur/George/George Arthur</b></font>)</div><p/>As they walked out they got a message, to say that Arthur was just
starting, and would like to say goodbye. So they went down to the
private entrance of the School-house, and found an open carriage,
with Arthur propped up with pillows in it, looking already better, Tom
thought.

<p/>They jumped up on to the steps to shake hands with him (<font color='blue'><b>Tom</b></font>), and Tom mumbled
thanks for the presents he (<font color='blue'><b>Tom</b></font>) had found in his (<font color='blue'><b>Tom</b></font>) study, and looked round
anxiously for Arthur's mother.

<p/>East, who had fallen back into his (<font color='blue'><b>Arthur</b></font>) usual humour, looked quaintly at
Arthur, and said,--

<p/><div class="bookquote">``So you've been at it again, through that hot-headed convert of yours
there. He (<font color='blue'><b>Doctor</b></font>)'s been making our lives a burden to us all the morning about
using cribs. I shall get floored to a certainty at second lesson, if I'm
called up.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Arthur/George/George Arthur</b></font>)</div><p/>Arthur blushed and looked down. Tom struck in,--

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Oh, it's all right. He (<font color='blue'><b>Doctor</b></font>)'s converted already; he (<font color='blue'><b>Doctor</b></font>) always comes through the
mud after us, grumbling and sputtering.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Tom/Brown/Tom Brown</b></font>)</div><p/>The clock struck, and they had to go off to school, wishing Arthur a
pleasant holiday, Tom, lingering behind a moment to send his (<font color='blue'><b>Tom</b></font>) thanks and
love to Arthur's mother.

<p/>Tom renewed the discussion after second lesson, and succeeded so far as
to get East to promise to give the new plan a fair trial.

<p/>Encouraged by his (<font color='blue'><b>Tom</b></font>) success, in the evening, when they were sitting alone
in the large study, where East lived now almost, <div class="bookquote">``vice Arthur on leave,''
 (<font color='red'><b>Arthur/George/George Arthur</b></font>)</div>after examining the new fishing-rod, which both pronounced to be the
genuine article -LRB-<div class="bookquote">``play enough to throw a midge tied on a single
hair against the wind, and strength enough to hold a grampus'' (<font color='red'><b>Arthur/George/George Arthur</b></font>)</div>-RRB-, they
naturally began talking about Arthur. Tom, who was still bubbling over
with last night's scene and all the thoughts of the last week, and
wanting to clinch and fix the whole in his (<font color='blue'><b>Tom</b></font>) own mind, which he (<font color='blue'><b>Tom</b></font>) could
never do without first going through the process of belabouring somebody
else with it all, suddenly rushed into the subject of Arthur's illness,
and what he (<font color='blue'><b>Arthur</b></font>) had said about death.

<p/>East had given him (<font color='blue'><b>Arthur</b></font>) the desired opening. After a serio-comic grumble,
<div class="bookquote">``that life wasn't worth having, now they were tied to a young beggar
who was always `raising his (<font color='blue'><b>beggar</b></font>) standard;' and that he (<font color='blue'><b>beggar</b></font>), East, was like a
prophet's donkey, who was obliged to struggle on after the donkey-man
who went after the prophet; that he (<font color='blue'><b>prophet</b></font>) had none of the pleasure of starting
the new crotchets, and didn't half understand them, but had to take the
kicks and carry the luggage as if he (<font color='blue'><b>prophet</b></font>) had all the fun,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Arthur</b></font>) threw his (<font color='blue'><b>Arthur</b></font>) legs
up on to the sofa, and put his (<font color='blue'><b>Arthur</b></font>) hands behind his (<font color='blue'><b>Arthur</b></font>) head, and said,--

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Well, after all, he (<font color='blue'><b>prophet</b></font>)'s the most wonderful little fellow I ever came
across. There ain't such a meek, humble boy in the school. Hanged if
I don't think now, really, Tom, that he (<font color='blue'><b>Tom</b></font>) believes himself a much worse
fellow than you or I, and that he (<font color='blue'><b>Tom</b></font>) don't think he (<font color='blue'><b>Tom</b></font>) has more influence in
the house than Dot Bowles, who came last quarter, and isn't ten yet. But
he (<font color='blue'><b>Bowles</b></font>) turns you and me round his (<font color='blue'><b>Bowles</b></font>) little finger, old boy--there's no mistake
about that.''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>And East nodded at Tom sagaciously.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Now or never!''  (<font color='red'><b>Tom/Brown/Tom Brown</b></font>)</div>thought Tom; so, shutting his (<font color='blue'><b>Tom</b></font>) eyes and hardening his (<font color='blue'><b>Tom</b></font>)
heart, he (<font color='blue'><b>Tom</b></font>) went straight at it, repeating all that Arthur had said, as
near as he (<font color='blue'><b>Arthur</b></font>) could remember it, in the very words, and all he (<font color='blue'><b>Arthur</b></font>) had himself
thought. The life seemed to ooze out of it as he (<font color='blue'><b>Arthur</b></font>) went on, and several
times he (<font color='blue'><b>Arthur</b></font>) felt inclined to stop, give it all up, and change the subject.
But somehow he (<font color='blue'><b>Arthur</b></font>) was borne on; he (<font color='blue'><b>Arthur</b></font>) had a necessity upon him (<font color='blue'><b>Arthur</b></font>) to speak it all
out, and did so. At the end he (<font color='blue'><b>Arthur</b></font>) looked at East with some anxiety, and was
delighted to see that that young gentleman was thoughtful and attentive.
The fact is, that in the stage of his (<font color='blue'><b>gentleman</b></font>) inner life at which Tom had lately
arrived, his (<font color='blue'><b>Tom</b></font>) intimacy with and friendship for East could not have lasted
if he (<font color='blue'><b>Tom</b></font>) had not made him (<font color='blue'><b>Tom</b></font>) aware of, and a sharer in, the thoughts that were
beginning to exercise him (<font color='blue'><b>Tom</b></font>). Nor indeed could the friendship have lasted
if East had shown no sympathy with these thoughts; so that it was a
great relief to have unbosomed himself, and to have found that his (<font color='blue'><b>Tom</b></font>)
friend could listen.

<p/>Tom had always had a sort of instinct that East's levity was only
skin-deep, and this instinct was a true one. East had no want of
reverence for anything he (<font color='blue'><b>Tom</b></font>) felt to be real; but his (<font color='blue'><b>Tom</b></font>) was one of those
natures that burst into what is generally called recklessness and
impiety the moment they feel that anything is being poured upon them for
their good which does not come home to their inborn sense of right, or
which appeals to anything like self-interest in them. Daring and
honest by nature, and outspoken to an extent which alarmed all
respectabilities, with a constant fund of animal health and spirits
which he (<font color='blue'><b>Tom</b></font>) did not feel bound to curb in any way, he (<font color='blue'><b>Tom</b></font>) had gained for
himself with the steady part of the school -LRB-including as well those who
wished to appear steady as those who really were so-RRB- the character of a
boy with whom it would be dangerous to be intimate; while his (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>) own hatred
of everything cruel, or underhand, or false, and his (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>) hearty respect for
what he (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>) would see to be good and true, kept off the rest.

<p/>Tom, besides being very like East in many points of character, had
largely developed in his (<font color='blue'><b>Tom</b></font>) composition the capacity for taking the weakest
side. This is not putting it strongly enough: it was a necessity with
him (<font color='blue'><b>Tom</b></font>); he (<font color='blue'><b>Tom</b></font>) couldn't help it any more than he (<font color='blue'><b>Tom</b></font>) could eating or drinking. He (<font color='blue'><b>Tom</b></font>)
could never play on the strongest side with any heart at football or
cricket, and was sure to make friends with any boy who was unpopular, or
down on his (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>) luck.

<p/>Now, though East was not what is generally called unpopular, Tom felt
more and more every day, as their characters developed, that he (<font color='blue'><b>Tom</b></font>)
stood alone, and did not make friends among their contemporaries, and
therefore sought him (<font color='blue'><b>Tom</b></font>) out. Tom was himself much more popular, for his (<font color='blue'><b>Tom</b></font>)
power of detecting humbug was much less acute, and his (<font color='blue'><b>Tom</b></font>) instincts were
much more sociable. He (<font color='blue'><b>Tom</b></font>) was at this period of his (<font color='blue'><b>Tom</b></font>) life, too, largely
given to taking people for what they gave themselves out to be; but
his (<font color='blue'><b>Tom</b></font>) singleness of heart, fearlessness, and honesty were just what East
appreciated, and thus the two had been drawn into great intimacy.

<p/>This intimacy had not been interrupted by Tom's guardianship of Arthur.

<p/>East had often, as has been said, joined them in reading the Bible; but
their discussions had almost always turned upon the characters of the
men and women of whom they read, and not become personal to themselves.
In fact, the two had shrunk from personal religious discussion, not
knowing how it might end, and fearful of risking a friendship very dear
to both, and which they felt somehow, without quite knowing why,
would never be the same, but either tenfold stronger or sapped at its
foundation, after such a communing together.

<p/>What a bother all this explaining is! I wish we could get on without
it. But we can't. However, you'll all find, if you haven't found it out
already, that a time comes in every human friendship when you must go
down into the depths of yourself, and lay bare what is there to your
friend, and wait in fear for his (<font color='blue'><b>friend</b></font>) answer. A few moments may do it; and
it may be -LRB-most likely will be, as you are English boys-RRB- that you will
never do it but once. But done it must be, if the friendship is to be
worth the name. You must find what is there, at the very root and bottom
of one another's hearts; and if you are at one there, nothing on earth
can or at least ought to sunder you.

<p/>East had remained lying down until Tom finished speaking, as if fearing
to interrupt him (<font color='blue'><b>Tom</b></font>); he (<font color='blue'><b>Tom</b></font>) now sat up at the table, and leant his (<font color='blue'><b>Tom</b></font>) head on one
hand, taking up a pencil with the other, and working little holes with
it in the table-cover. After a bit he (<font color='blue'><b>Tom</b></font>) looked up, stopped the pencil,
and said, <div class="bookquote">``Thank you very much, old fellow. There's no other boy in
the house would have done it for me but you or Arthur. I can see well
enough,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Tom</b></font>) went on, after a pause, <div class="bookquote">``all the best big fellows look on me
with suspicion; they think I'm a devil-may-care, reckless young scamp.
So I am--eleven hours out of twelve, but not the twelfth. Then all of
our contemporaries worth knowing follow suit, of course: we're very good
friends at games and all that, but not a soul of them but you and
Arthur ever tried to break through the crust, and see whether there was
anything at the bottom of me; and then the bad ones I won't stand and
they know that.''

 (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Don't you think that's half fancy, Harry?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Not a bit of it,''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>said East bitterly, pegging away with his (<font color='blue'><b>Tom</b></font>) pencil.
<div class="bookquote">``I see it all plain enough. Bless you, you think everybody's as
straightforward and kindhearted as you are.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Well, but what's the reason of it? There must be a reason. You can play
all the games as well as any one and sing the best song, and are the
best company in the house. You fancy you're not liked, Harry. It's all
fancy.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I only wish it was, Tom. I know I could be popular enough with all the
bad ones, but that I won't have, and the good ones won't have me.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Why not?''  (<font color='red'><b>Tom/Brown/Tom Brown</b></font>)</div>persisted Tom; <div class="bookquote">``you don't drink or swear, or get out at
night; you never bully, or cheat at lessons. If you only showed you
liked it, you'd have all the best fellows in the house running after
you.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Tom/Brown/Tom Brown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Not I,''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>said East. Then with an effort he (<font color='blue'><b>Tom</b></font>) went on, <div class="bookquote">``I'll tell you what
it is. I never stop the Sacrament. I can see, from the Doctor downwards,
how that tells against me.''

 (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Yes, I've seen that,''  (<font color='red'><b>Tom/Brown/Tom Brown</b></font>)</div>said Tom, <div class="bookquote">``and I've been very sorry for it, and
Arthur and I have talked about it. I've often thought of speaking to
you, but it's so hard to begin on such subjects. I'm very glad you've
opened it. Now, why don't you?''

 (<font color='red'><b>Tom/Brown/Tom Brown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I've never been confirmed,''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>said East.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Not been confirmed!''  (<font color='red'><b>Tom/Brown/Tom Brown</b></font>)</div>said Tom, in astonishment. <div class="bookquote">``I never thought of
that. Why weren't you confirmed with the rest of us nearly three years
ago? I always thought you'd been confirmed at home.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``No,''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>answered East sorrowfully; <div class="bookquote">``you see this was how it happened. Last
Confirmation was soon after Arthur came, and you were so taken up with
him (<font color='blue'><b>Arthur</b></font>) I hardly saw either of you. Well, when the Doctor sent round for us
about it, I was living mostly with Green's set. You know the sort. They
all went in. I dare say it was all right, and they got good by it; I
don't want to judge them. Only all I could see of their reasons drove me
just the other way. `Twas `because the Doctor liked it;' `no boy got
on who didn't stay the Sacrament;' it was the `correct thing,' in fact,
like having a good hat to wear on Sundays. I couldn't stand it. I didn't
feel that I wanted to lead a different life. I was very well content
as I was, and I wasn't going to sham religious to curry favour with the
Doctor, or any one else.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/>East stopped speaking, and pegged away more diligently than ever with
his (<font color='blue'><b>Tom</b></font>) pencil. Tom was ready to cry. He (<font color='blue'><b>Tom</b></font>) felt half sorry at first that he (<font color='blue'><b>Tom</b></font>)
had been confirmed himself. He (<font color='blue'><b>Tom</b></font>) seemed to have deserted his (<font color='blue'><b>Tom</b></font>) earliest
friend--to have left him (<font color='blue'><b>Tom</b></font>) by himself at his (<font color='blue'><b>Tom</b></font>) worst need for those long
years. He (<font color='blue'><b>Tom</b></font>) got up and went and sat by East, and put his (<font color='blue'><b>Tom</b></font>) arm over his (<font color='blue'><b>Tom</b></font>)
shoulder.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Dear old boy,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Tom</b></font>) said, <div class="bookquote">``how careless and selfish I've been. But why
didn't you come and talk to Arthur and me?''

 (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I wish to Heaven I had,''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>said East, <div class="bookquote">``but I was a fool. It's too late
talking of it now.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Why too late? You want to be confirmed now, don't you?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I think so,''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>said East. <div class="bookquote">``I've thought about it a good deal; only, often
I fancy I must be changing, because I see it's to do me good here--just
what stopped me last time. And then I go back again.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I'll tell you now how `twas with me,''  (<font color='red'><b>Tom/Brown/Tom Brown</b></font>)</div>said Tom warmly. <div class="bookquote">``If it hadn't
been for Arthur, I should have done just as you did. I hope I should. I
honour you for it. But then he (<font color='blue'><b>Arthur</b></font>) made it out just as if it was taking the
weak side before all the world--going in once for all against everything
that's strong and rich, and proud and respectable, a little band of
brothers against the whole world. And the Doctor seemed to say so too,
only he (<font color='blue'><b>Doctor</b></font>) said a great deal more.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Ah!''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>groaned East, <div class="bookquote">``but there again, that's just another of my
difficulties whenever I think about the matter. I don't want to be one
of your saints, one of your elect, whatever the right phrase is. My
sympathies are all the other way--with the many, the poor devils who run
about the streets and don't go to church. Don't stare, Tom; mind, I'm
telling you all that's in my heart--as far as I know it--but it's all a
muddle. You must be gentle with me if you want to land me. Now I've seen
a deal of this sort of religion; I was bred up in it, and I can't stand
it. If nineteen-twentieths of the world are to be left to uncovenanted
mercies, and that sort of thing, which means in plain English to go to
hell, and the other twentieth are to rejoice at it all, why--''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Oh! but, Harry, they ain't, they don't,''  (<font color='red'><b>Tom/Brown/Tom Brown</b></font>)</div>broke in Tom, really shocked.
<div class="bookquote">``Oh, how I wish Arthur hadn't gone! I'm such a fool about these things.
But it's all you want too, East; it is indeed. It cuts both ways
somehow, being confirmed and taking the Sacrament. It makes you feel on
the side of all the good and all the bad too, of everybody in the world.
Only there's some great dark strong power, which is crushing you and
everybody else. That's what Christ conquered, and we've got to fight.
What a fool I am! I can't explain. If Arthur were only here!''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I begin to get a glimmering of what you mean,''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>said East.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``I say, now,''  (<font color='red'><b>Tom/Brown/Tom Brown</b></font>)</div>said Tom eagerly, <div class="bookquote">``do you remember how we both hated
Flashman?''

 (<font color='red'><b>Tom/Brown/Tom Brown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Of course I do,''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>said East; <div class="bookquote">``I hate him (<font color='blue'><b>Arthur</b></font>) still. What then?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Well, when I came to take the Sacrament, I had a great struggle about
that. I tried to put him (<font color='blue'><b>Arthur</b></font>) out of my head; and when I couldn't do that, I
tried to think of him (<font color='blue'><b>Arthur</b></font>) as evil--as something that the Lord who was loving
me hated, and which I might hate too. But it wouldn't do. I broke down;
I believe Christ Himself broke me down. And when the Doctor gave me the
bread and wine, and leant over me praying, I prayed for poor Flashman,
as if it had been you or Arthur.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/>East buried his (<font color='blue'><b>Tom</b></font>) face in his (<font color='blue'><b>Tom</b></font>) hands on the table. Tom could feel the table
tremble. At last he (<font color='blue'><b>Tom</b></font>) looked up. <div class="bookquote">``Thank you again, Tom,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>said he (<font color='blue'><b>Tom</b></font>); <div class="bookquote">``you
don't know what you may have done for me to-night. I think I see now how
the right sort of sympathy with poor devils is got at.''

 (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``And you'll stop the Sacrament next time, won't you?''  (<font color='red'><b>Tom/Brown/Tom Brown</b></font>)</div>said Tom.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Can I, before I'm confirmed?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Go and ask the Doctor.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I will.''

 (<font color='red'><b>the Doctor verger</b></font>)</div><p/>That very night, after prayers, East followed the Doctor, and the old
verger bearing the candle, upstairs. Tom watched, and saw the Doctor
turn round when he (<font color='blue'><b>Tom</b></font>) heard footsteps following him (<font color='blue'><b>Tom</b></font>) closer than usual, and
say, <div class="bookquote">``Hah, East! Do you want to speak to me, my man?''

 (<font color='red'><b>him</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``If you please, sir.''  (<font color='red'><b>Tom/Brown/Tom Brown</b></font>)</div>And the private door closed, and Tom went to his (<font color='blue'><b>Tom</b></font>)
study in a state of great trouble of mind.

<p/>It was almost an hour before East came back. Then he (<font color='blue'><b>Tom</b></font>) rushed in
breathless.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Well, it's all right,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Tom</b></font>) shouted, seizing Tom by the hand. <div class="bookquote">``I feel as
if a ton weight were off my mind.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Hurrah,''  (<font color='red'><b>Tom/Brown/Tom Brown</b></font>)</div>said Tom. <div class="bookquote">``I knew it would be; but tell us all about it.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Well, I just told him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) all about it. You can't think how kind and gentle
he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) was, the great grim man, whom I've feared more than anybody on earth.
When I stuck, he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) lifted me just as if I'd been a little child. And he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>)
seemed to know all I'd felt, and to have gone through it all. And I
burst out crying--more than I've done this five years; and he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) sat down
by me, and stroked my head; and I went blundering on, and told him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>)
all--much worse things than I've told you. And he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) wasn't shocked a bit,
and didn't snub me, or tell me I was a fool, and it was all nothing but
pride or wickedness, though I dare say it was. And he (<font color='blue'><b>fool</b></font>) didn't tell me
not to follow out my thoughts, and he (<font color='blue'><b>fool</b></font>) didn't give me any cut-and-dried
explanation. But when I'd done he (<font color='blue'><b>fool</b></font>) just talked a bit. I can hardly
remember what he (<font color='blue'><b>fool</b></font>) said yet; but it seemed to spread round me like
healing, and strength, and light, and to bear me up, and plant me on a
rock, where I could hold my footing and fight for myself. I don't know
what to do, I feel so happy. And it's all owing to you, dear old boy!''
 (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>And he (<font color='blue'><b>Tom</b></font>) seized Tom's hand again.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``And you're to come to the Communion?''  (<font color='red'><b>Tom/Brown/Tom Brown</b></font>)</div>said Tom.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Yes, and to be confirmed in the holidays.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Tom/Brown/Tom Brown</b></font>)</div><p/>Tom's delight was as great as his (<font color='blue'><b>Tom</b></font>) friend's. But he (<font color='blue'><b>Tom</b></font>) hadn't yet had
out all his (<font color='blue'><b>Tom</b></font>) own talk, and was bent on improving the occasion: so he (<font color='blue'><b>Tom</b></font>)
proceeded to propound Arthur's theory about not being sorry for his (<font color='blue'><b>Tom</b></font>)
friends' deaths, which he (<font color='blue'><b>Tom</b></font>) had hitherto kept in the background, and by
which he (<font color='blue'><b>Tom</b></font>) was much exercised; for he (<font color='blue'><b>Tom</b></font>) didn't feel it honest to take what
pleased him (<font color='blue'><b>Tom</b></font>), and throw over the rest, and was trying vigorously to
persuade himself that he (<font color='blue'><b>Tom</b></font>) should like all his (<font color='blue'><b>Tom</b></font>) best friends to die
off-hand.

<p/>But East's powers of remaining serious were exhausted, and in five
minutes he (<font color='blue'><b>Tom</b></font>) was saying the most ridiculous things he (<font color='blue'><b>Tom</b></font>) could think of, till
Tom was almost getting angry again.

<p/>Despite of himself, however, he (<font color='blue'><b>Tom</b></font>) couldn't help laughing and giving it up,
when East appealed to him (<font color='blue'><b>East</b></font>) with, <div class="bookquote">``Well, Tom, you ain't going to punch my
head, I hope, because I insist upon being sorry when you got to earth?''

 (<font color='red'><b>him</b></font>)</div><p/>And so their talk finished for that time, and they tried to learn first
lesson, with very poor success, as appeared next morning, when they were
called up and narrowly escaped being floored, which ill-luck, however,
did not sit heavily on either of their souls.



<p/>CHAPTER VIII--TOM BROWN'S LAST MATCH.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Heaven grant the manlier heart, that timely ere
Youth fly, with life's real tempest would be coping;
The fruit of dreamy hoping
Is, waking, blank despair.'' (<font color='red'><b>CLOUGH/Clough</b></font>)</div>--CLOUGH, Ambarvalia.

<p/>The curtain now rises upon the last act of our little drama, for
hard-hearted publishers warn me that a single volume must of necessity
have an end. Well, well! the pleasantest things must come to an end.
I little thought last long vacation, when I began these pages to help
while away some spare time at a watering-place, how vividly many an old
scene which had lain hid away for years in some dusty old corner of my
brain, would come back again, and stand before me as clear and bright as
if it had happened yesterday. The book has been a most grateful task
to me, and I only hope that all you, my dear young friends, who read it
-LRB-friends assuredly you must be, if you get as far as this-RRB-, will be half
as sorry to come to the last stage as I am.

<p/>Not but what there has been a solemn and a sad side to it. As the old
scenes became living, and the actors in them became living too, many
a grave in the Crimea and distant India, as well as in the quiet
churchyards of our dear old country, seemed to open and send forth their
dead, and their voices and looks and ways were again in one's ears and
eyes, as in the old School-days. But this was not sad. How should it be,
if we believe as our Lord has taught us? How should it be, when one more
turn of the wheel, and we shall be by their sides again, learning from
them again, perhaps, as we did when we were new boys.

<p/>Then there were others of the old faces so dear to us once who had
somehow or another just gone clean out of sight. Are they dead or
living? We know not, but the thought of them brings no sadness with it.
Wherever they are, we can well believe they are doing God's work and
getting His (<font color='blue'><b>God</b></font>) wages.

<p/>But are there not some, whom we still see sometimes in the streets,
whose haunts and homes we know, whom we could probably find almost any
day in the week if we were set to do it, yet from whom we are really
farther than we are from the dead, and from those who have gone out of
our ken? Yes, there are and must be such; and therein lies the sadness
of old School memories. Yet of these our old comrades, from whom more
than time and space separate us, there are some by whose sides we can
feel sure that we shall stand again when time shall be no more. We may
think of one another now as dangerous fanatics or narrow bigots, with
whom no truce is possible, from whom we shall only sever more and more
to the end of our lives, whom it would be our respective duties to
imprison or hang, if we had the power. We must go our way, and they
theirs, as long as flesh and spirit hold together; but let our own Rugby
poet speak words of healing for this trial:--

<p/>``To veer how vain! on, onward strain,
Brave barks, in light, in darkness too;
Through winds and tides one compass guides,--
To that, and your own selves, be true.

<p/>``But, O blithe breeze, and O great seas,
Though ne’er that earliest parting past,
On your wide plain they join again;
Together lead them home at last.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``One port, methought, alike they sought,
One purpose hold where’er they fare.
O bounding breeze, O rushing seas,
At last, at last, unite them there!''  (<font color='red'><b>CLOUGH/Clough</b></font>)</div>*


<p/>* Clough, Ambarvalia.

<p/>This is not mere longing; it is prophecy. So over these too, our old
friends, who are friends no more, we sorrow not as men without hope. It
is only for those who seem to us to have lost compass and purpose, and
to be driven helplessly on rocks and quicksands, whose lives are spent
in the service of the world, the flesh, and the devil, for self alone,
and not for their fellow-men, their country, or their God, that we must
mourn and pray without sure hope and without light, trusting only that
He (<font color='blue'><b>God</b></font>), in whose hands they as well as we are, who has died for them as well
as for us, who sees all His (<font color='blue'><b>God</b></font>) creatures

<p/><div class="bookquote">``With larger other eyes than ours,
To make allowance for us all,''

 (<font color='red'><b>creatures</b></font>)</div><p/>will, in His (<font color='blue'><b>God</b></font>) own way and at His (<font color='blue'><b>God</b></font>) own time, lead them also home.

<p/>Another two years have passed, and it is again the end of the summer
half-year at Rugby; in fact, the School has broken up. The fifth-form
examinations were over last week, and upon them have followed the
speeches, and the sixth-form examinations for exhibitions; and they too
are over now. The boys have gone to all the winds of heaven, except the
town boys and the eleven, and the few enthusiasts besides who have asked
leave to stay in their houses to see the result of the cricket matches.
For this year the Wellesburn return match and the Marylebone match are
played at Rugby, to the great delight of the town and neighbourhood, and
the sorrow of those aspiring young cricketers who have been reckoning
for the last three months on showing off at Lord's ground.

<p/>The Doctor started for the Lakes yesterday morning, after an interview
with the captain of the eleven, in the presence of Thomas, at which he (<font color='blue'><b>Thomas</b></font>)
arranged in what school the cricket dinners were to be, and all other
matters necessary for the satisfactory carrying out of the festivities,
and warned them as to keeping all spirituous liquors out of the close,
and having the gates closed by nine o’clock.

<p/>The Wellesburn match was played out with great success yesterday, the
School winning by three wickets; and to-day the great event of the
cricketing year, the Marylebone match, is being played. What a match it
has been! The London eleven came down by an afternoon train yesterday,
in time to see the end of the Wellesburn match; and as soon as it was
over, their leading men and umpire inspected the ground, criticising it
rather unmercifully. The captain of the School eleven, and one or
two others, who had played the Lord's match before, and knew old Mr.
Aislabie and several of the Lord's men, accompanied them; while the rest
of the eleven looked on from under the Three Trees with admiring eyes,
and asked one another the names of the illustrious strangers, and
recounted how many runs each of them had made in the late matches in
Bell's Life. They looked such hard-bitten, wiry, whiskered fellows that
their young adversaries felt rather desponding as to the result of the
morrow's match. The ground was at last chosen, and two men set to work
upon it to water and roll; and then, there being yet some half-hour of
daylight, some one had suggested a dance on the turf. The close was
half full of citizens and their families, and the idea was hailed
with enthusiasm. The cornopean player was still on the ground. In five
minutes the eleven and half a dozen of the Wellesburn and Marylebone men
got partners somehow or another, and a merry country-dance was going on,
to which every one flocked, and new couples joined in every minute, till
there were a hundred of them going down the middle and up again; and the
long line of school buildings looked gravely down on them, every window
glowing with the last rays of the western sun; and the rooks clanged
about in the tops of the old elms, greatly excited, and resolved on
having their country-dance too; and the great flag flapped lazily in the
gentle western breeze. Altogether it was a sight which would have made
glad the heart of our brave old founder, Lawrence Sheriff, if he (<font color='blue'><b>Sheriff</b></font>) were
half as good a fellow as I take him (<font color='blue'><b>Sheriff</b></font>) to have been. It was a cheerful
sight to see. But what made it so valuable in the sight of the captain
of the School eleven was that he (<font color='blue'><b>captain</b></font>) there saw his (<font color='blue'><b>captain</b></font>) young hands shaking
off their shyness and awe of the Lord's men, as they crossed hands and
capered about on the grass together; for the strangers entered into
it all, and threw away their cigars, and danced and shouted like boys;
while old Mr. Aislabie stood by looking on in his (<font color='blue'><b>Aislabie</b></font>) white hat, leaning on
a bat, in benevolent enjoyment. <div class="bookquote">``This hop will be worth thirty runs to
us to-morrow, and will be the making of Raggles and Johnson,''  (<font color='red'><b>the leader</b></font>)</div>thinks the
young leader, as he (<font color='blue'><b>leader</b></font>) revolves many things in his (<font color='blue'><b>leader</b></font>) mind, standing by the
side of Mr. Aislabie, whom he (<font color='blue'><b>Aislabie</b></font>) will not leave for a minute, for he (<font color='blue'><b>Aislabie</b></font>)
feels that the character of the School for courtesy is resting on his (<font color='blue'><b>Aislabie</b></font>)
shoulders.

<p/>But when a quarter to nine struck, and he (<font color='blue'><b>Aislabie</b></font>) saw old Thomas beginning
to fidget about with the keys in his (<font color='blue'><b>Thomas</b></font>) hand, he (<font color='blue'><b>Thomas</b></font>) thought of the Doctor's
parting monition, and stopped the cornopean at once, notwithstanding the
loud-voiced remonstrances from all sides; and the crowd scattered away
from the close, the eleven all going into the School-house, where supper
and beds were provided for them by the Doctor's orders.

<p/>Deep had been the consultations at supper as to the order of going in,
who should bowl the first over, whether it would be best to play steady
or freely; and the youngest hands declared that they shouldn't be a
bit nervous, and praised their opponents as the jolliest fellows in the
world, except perhaps their old friends the Wellesburn men. How far
a little good-nature from their elders will go with the right sort of
boys!

<p/>The morning had dawned bright and warm, to the intense relief of many
an anxious youngster, up betimes to mark the signs of the weather. The
eleven went down in a body before breakfast, for a plunge in the cold
bath in a corner of the close. The ground was in splendid order, and
soon after ten o’clock, before spectators had arrived, all was ready,
and two of the Lord's men took their places at the wickets--the School,
with the usual liberality of young hands, having put their adversaries
in first. Old Bailey stepped up to the wicket, and called play, and the
match has begun.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Oh, well bowled! well bowled, Johnson!''  (<font color='red'><b>the captain</b></font>)</div>cries the captain, catching
up the ball and sending it high above the rook trees, while the third
Marylebone man walks away from the wicket, and old Bailey gravely sets
up the middle stump again and puts the bails on.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``How many runs?''  (<font color='red'><b>boys</b></font>)</div>Away scamper three boys to the scoring table, and are
back again in a minute amongst the rest of the eleven, who are collected
together in a knot between wicket. <div class="bookquote">``Only eighteen runs, and three
wickets down!''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``Huzza for old Rugby!''  (<font color='red'><b>Jack/Jack Raggles</b></font>)</div>sings out Jack Raggles, the
long-stop, toughest and burliest of boys, commonly called <div class="bookquote">``Swiper Jack,''
 (<font color='red'><b>boys</b></font>)</div>and forthwith stands on his (<font color='blue'><b>Raggles</b></font>) head, and brandishes his (<font color='blue'><b>Raggles</b></font>) legs in the air
in triumph, till the next boy catches hold of his (<font color='blue'><b>Raggles</b></font>) heels, and throws him (<font color='blue'><b>Raggles</b></font>)
over on to his (<font color='blue'><b>Raggles</b></font>) back.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Steady there; don't be such an ass, Jack,''  (<font color='red'><b>the captain</b></font>)</div>says the captain; <div class="bookquote">``we
haven't got the best wicket yet. Ah, look out now at cover-point,''  (<font color='red'><b>the captain</b></font>)</div>adds
he (<font color='blue'><b>Raggles</b></font>), as he (<font color='blue'><b>Raggles</b></font>) sees a long-armed bare-headed, slashing-looking player coming
to the wicket. <div class="bookquote">``And, Jack, mind your hits. He (<font color='blue'><b>Jack</b></font>) steals more runs than any
man in England.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/>And they all find that they have got their work to do now. The
newcomer's off-hitting is tremendous, and his (<font color='blue'><b>newcomer</b></font>) running like a flash of
lightning. He (<font color='blue'><b>newcomer</b></font>) is never in his (<font color='blue'><b>newcomer</b></font>) ground except when his (<font color='blue'><b>newcomer</b></font>) wicket is down.
Nothing in the whole game so trying to boys. He (<font color='blue'><b>newcomer</b></font>) has stolen three byes in
the first ten minutes, and Jack Raggles is furious, and begins throwing
over savagely to the farther wicket, until he (<font color='blue'><b>Raggles</b></font>) is sternly stopped by the
captain. It is all that young gentlemen can do to keep his (<font color='blue'><b>Raggles</b></font>) team steady,
but he (<font color='blue'><b>Raggles</b></font>) knows that everything depends on it, and faces his (<font color='blue'><b>Raggles</b></font>) work bravely.
The score creeps up to fifty; the boys begin to look blank; and the
spectators, who are now mustering strong, are very silent. The ball
flies off his (<font color='blue'><b>Raggles</b></font>) bat to all parts of the field, and he (<font color='blue'><b>Raggles</b></font>) gives no rest and
no catches to any one. But cricket is full of glorious chances, and
the goddess who presides over it loves to bring down the most skilful
players. Johnson, the young bowler, is getting wild, and bowls a ball
almost wide to the off; the batter steps out and cuts it beautifully to
where cover-point is standing very deep--in fact almost off the ground.
The ball comes skimming and twisting along about three feet from the
ground; he (<font color='blue'><b>batter</b></font>) rushes at it, and it sticks somehow or other in the fingers
of his (<font color='blue'><b>batter</b></font>) left hand, to the utter astonishment of himself and the whole
field. Such a catch hasn't been made in the close for years, and the
cheering is maddening. <div class="bookquote">``Pretty cricket,''  (<font color='red'><b>the captain</b></font>)</div>says the captain, throwing
himself on the ground by the deserted wicket with a long breath. He (<font color='blue'><b>captain</b></font>)
feels that a crisis has passed.

<p/>I wish I had space to describe the match--how the captain stumped the
next man off a leg-shooter, and bowled small cobs to old Mr. Aislabie,
who came in for the last wicket; how the Lord's men were out by
half-past twelve o’clock for ninety-eight runs; how the captain of
the School eleven went in first to give his (<font color='blue'><b>captain</b></font>) men pluck, and scored
twenty-five in beautiful style; how Rugby was only four behind in
the first innings; what a glorious dinner they had in the fourth-form
school; and how the cover-point hitter sang the most topping comic
songs, and old Mr. Aislabie made the best speeches that ever were heard,
afterwards. But I haven't space--that's the fact; and so you must fancy
it all, and carry yourselves on to half-past seven o’clock, when the
School are again in, with five wickets down, and only thirty-two runs
to make to win. The Marylebone men played carelessly in their second
innings, but they are working like horses now to save the match.

<p/>There is much healthy, hearty, happy life scattered up and down the
close; but the group to which I beg to call your especial attention
is there, on the slope of the island, which looks towards the
cricket-ground. It consists of three figures; two are seated on a bench,
and one on the ground at their feet. The first, a tall, slight and
rather gaunt man, with a bushy eyebrow and a dry, humorous smile, is
evidently a clergyman. He (<font color='blue'><b>clergyman</b></font>) is carelessly dressed, and looks rather used
up, which isn't much to be wondered at, seeing that he (<font color='blue'><b>clergyman</b></font>) has just finished
six weeks of examination work; but there he (<font color='blue'><b>clergyman</b></font>) basks, and spreads himself
out in the evening sun, bent on enjoying life, though he (<font color='blue'><b>clergyman</b></font>) doesn't quite
know what to do with his (<font color='blue'><b>clergyman</b></font>) arms and legs. Surely it is our friend the
young master, whom we have had glimpses of before, but his (<font color='blue'><b>master</b></font>) face has
gained a great deal since we last came across him (<font color='blue'><b>master</b></font>).

<p/>And by his (<font color='blue'><b>master</b></font>) side, in white flannel shirt and trousers, straw hat, the
captain's belt, and the untanned yellow cricket shoes which all the
eleven wear, sits a strapping figure, near six feet high, with ruddy,
tanned face and whiskers, curly brown hair, and a laughing, dancing eye.
He (<font color='blue'><b>captain</b></font>) is leaning forward with his (<font color='blue'><b>captain</b></font>) elbows resting on his (<font color='blue'><b>captain</b></font>) knees, and dandling
his (<font color='blue'><b>captain</b></font>) favourite bat, with which he (<font color='blue'><b>captain</b></font>) has made thirty or forty runs to-day,
in his (<font color='blue'><b>captain</b></font>) strong brown hands. It is Tom Brown, grown into a young man
nineteen years old, a praepostor and captain of the eleven, spending
his (<font color='blue'><b>captain</b></font>) last day as a Rugby boy, and, let us hope, as much wiser as he (<font color='blue'><b>captain</b></font>) is
bigger, since we last had the pleasure of coming across him (<font color='blue'><b>captain</b></font>).

<p/>And at their feet on the warm, dry ground, similarly dressed, sits
Arthur, Turkish fashion, with his (<font color='blue'><b>Arthur</b></font>) bat across his (<font color='blue'><b>Arthur</b></font>) knees. He (<font color='blue'><b>Arthur</b></font>) too is no
longer a boy--less of a boy, in fact, than Tom, if one may judge from
the thoughtfulness of his (<font color='blue'><b>Tom</b></font>) face, which is somewhat paler, too, than one
could wish; but his (<font color='blue'><b>Tom</b></font>) figure, though slight, is well knit and active, and
all his (<font color='blue'><b>Tom</b></font>) old timidity has disappeared, and is replaced by silent, quaint
fun, with which his (<font color='blue'><b>Tom</b></font>) face twinkles all over, as he (<font color='blue'><b>Tom</b></font>) listens to the broken
talk between the other two, in which he (<font color='blue'><b>Tom</b></font>) joins every now and then.

<p/>All three are watching the game eagerly, and joining in the cheering
which follows every good hit. It is pleasing to see the easy, friendly
footing which the pupils are on with their master, perfectly respectful,
yet with no reserve and nothing forced in their intercourse. Tom has
clearly abandoned the old theory of <div class="bookquote">``natural enemies''  (<font color='red'><b>Tom/Brown/Tom Brown</b></font>)</div>in this case at
any rate.

<p/>But it is time to listen to what they are saying, and see what we can
gather out of it.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``I don't object to your theory,''  (<font color='red'><b>the master</b></font>)</div>says the master, <div class="bookquote">``and I allow you have
made a fair case for yourself. But now, in such books as Aristophanes,
for instance, you've been reading a play this half with the Doctor,
haven't you?''

 (<font color='red'><b>the master</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Yes, the Knights,''  (<font color='red'><b>Tom/Brown/Tom Brown</b></font>)</div>answered Tom.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Well, I'm sure you would have enjoyed the wonderful humour of it twice
as much if you had taken more pains with your scholarship.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Well, sir, I don't believe any boy in the form enjoyed the sets-to
between Cleon and the Sausage-seller more than I did--eh, Arthur?''  (<font color='red'><b>Tom/Brown/Tom Brown</b></font>)</div>said
Tom, giving him (<font color='blue'><b>Tom</b></font>) a stir with his (<font color='blue'><b>Tom</b></font>) foot.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Yes, I must say he (<font color='blue'><b>Arthur</b></font>) did,''  (<font color='red'><b>Arthur/George/George Arthur</b></font>)</div>said Arthur. <div class="bookquote">``I think, sir, you've hit upon
the wrong book there.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Not a bit of it,''  (<font color='red'><b>the master</b></font>)</div>said the master. <div class="bookquote">``Why, in those very passages of
arms, how can you thoroughly appreciate them unless you are master of
the weapons? and the weapons are the language, which you, Brown, have
never half worked at; and so, as I say, you must have lost all the
delicate shades of meaning which make the best part of the fun.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Oh, well played! bravo, Johnson!''  (<font color='red'><b>Arthur/George/George Arthur</b></font>)</div>shouted Arthur, dropping his (<font color='blue'><b>Arthur</b></font>) bat and
clapping furiously, and Tom joined in with a <div class="bookquote">``Bravo, Johnson!''  (<font color='red'><b>Tom/Brown/Tom Brown</b></font>)</div>which
might have been heard at the chapel.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Eh! what was it? I didn't see,''  (<font color='red'><b>the master</b></font>)</div>inquired the master. <div class="bookquote">``They only got one
run, I thought?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``No, but such a ball, three-quarters length, and coming straight for his (<font color='blue'><b>Johnson</b></font>)
leg bail. Nothing but that turn of the wrist could have saved him (<font color='blue'><b>Johnson</b></font>), and
he (<font color='blue'><b>Johnson</b></font>) drew it away to leg for a safe one.--Bravo, Johnson!''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``How well they are bowling, though,''  (<font color='red'><b>Arthur/George/George Arthur</b></font>)</div>said Arthur; <div class="bookquote">``they don't mean to be
beat, I can see.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Arthur/George/George Arthur</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``There now,''  (<font color='red'><b>the master</b></font>)</div>struck in the master; <div class="bookquote">``you see that's just what I have been
preaching this half-hour. The delicate play is the true thing. I don't
understand cricket, so I don't enjoy those fine draws which you tell me
are the best play, though when you or Raggles hit a ball hard away for
six I am as delighted as any one. Don't you see the analogy?''

 (<font color='red'><b>the master</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Yes, sir,''  (<font color='red'><b>Tom/Brown/Tom Brown</b></font>)</div>answered Tom, looking up roguishly, <div class="bookquote">``I see; only the
question remains whether I should have got most good by understanding
Greek particles or cricket thoroughly. I'm such a thick, I never should
have had time for both.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Tom/Brown/Tom Brown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I see you are an incorrigible,''  (<font color='red'><b>the master</b></font>)</div>said the master, with a chuckle; <div class="bookquote">``but
I refute you by an example. Arthur there has taken in Greek and cricket
too.''

 (<font color='red'><b>the master</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Yes, but no thanks to him (<font color='blue'><b>Arthur</b></font>); Greek came natural to him (<font color='blue'><b>Arthur</b></font>). Why, when he (<font color='blue'><b>Arthur</b></font>)
first came I remember he (<font color='blue'><b>Arthur</b></font>) used to read Herodotus for pleasure as I did
Don Quixote, and couldn't have made a false concord if he (<font color='blue'><b>Don</b></font>)'d tried ever
so hard; and then I looked after his (<font color='blue'><b>Don</b></font>) cricket.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Out! Bailey has given him (<font color='blue'><b>Bailey</b></font>) out. Do you see, Tom?''  (<font color='red'><b>Arthur/George/George Arthur</b></font>)</div>cries Arthur. <div class="bookquote">``How
foolish of them to run so hard.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Well, it can't be helped; he (<font color='blue'><b>Tom</b></font>) has played very well. Whose turn is it to
go in?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I don't know; they've got your list in the tent.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Let's go and see,''  (<font color='red'><b>Tom/Brown/Tom Brown</b></font>)</div>said Tom, rising; but at this moment Jack Raggles
and two or three more came running to the island moat.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``O Brown, mayn't I go in next?''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>shouts the Swiper.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Whose name is next on the list?''  (<font color='red'><b>the captain</b></font>)</div>says the captain.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Winter's, and then Arthur's,''  (<font color='red'><b>the boy</b></font>)</div>answers the boy who carries it; <div class="bookquote">``but
there are only twenty-six runs to get, and no time to lose. I heard
Mr. Aislabie say that the stumps must be drawn at a quarter past eight
exactly.''

 (<font color='red'><b>the boy</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Oh, do let the Swiper go in,''  (<font color='red'><b>the boys</b></font>)</div>chorus the boys; so Tom yields against
his (<font color='blue'><b>Tom</b></font>) better judgment.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``I dare say now I've lost the match by this nonsense,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Tom</b></font>) says, as he (<font color='blue'><b>Tom</b></font>)
sits down again; <div class="bookquote">``they'll be sure to get Jack's wicket in three or four
minutes; however, you'll have the chance, sir, of seeing a hard hit or
two,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>adds he (<font color='blue'><b>Tom</b></font>), smiling, and turning to the master.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Come, none of your irony, Brown,''  (<font color='red'><b>the master</b></font>)</div>answers the master. <div class="bookquote">``I'm beginning to
understand the game scientifically. What a noble game it is, too!''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Isn't it? But it's more than a game. It's an institution,''  (<font color='red'><b>Tom/Brown/Tom Brown</b></font>)</div>said Tom.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Yes,''  (<font color='red'><b>Arthur/George/George Arthur</b></font>)</div>said Arthur--<div class="bookquote">``the birthright of British boys old and young, as
habeas corpus and trial by jury are of British men.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Arthur/George/George Arthur</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``The discipline and reliance on one another which it teaches is
so valuable, I think,''  (<font color='red'><b>the master</b></font>)</div>went on the master, <div class="bookquote">``it ought to be such an
unselfish game. It merges the individual in the eleven; he (<font color='blue'><b>individual</b></font>) doesn't play
that he (<font color='blue'><b>individual</b></font>) may win, but that his (<font color='blue'><b>individual</b></font>) side may.''

 (<font color='red'><b>the master</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``That's very true,''  (<font color='red'><b>Tom/Brown/Tom Brown</b></font>)</div>said Tom, <div class="bookquote">``and that's why football and cricket,
now one comes to think of it, are such much better games than fives or
hare-and-hounds, or any others where the object is to come in first or
to win for oneself, and not that one's side may win.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Tom/Brown/Tom Brown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``And then the captain of the eleven!''  (<font color='red'><b>the master</b></font>)</div>said the master; <div class="bookquote">``what a post is
his (<font color='blue'><b>captain</b></font>) in our School-world! almost as hard as the Doctor's--requiring skill
and gentleness and firmness, and I know not what other rare qualities.''

 (<font color='red'><b>the master</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Which don't he (<font color='blue'><b>Doctor</b></font>) may wish he (<font color='blue'><b>Doctor</b></font>) may get!''  (<font color='red'><b>Tom/Brown/Tom Brown</b></font>)</div>said Tom, laughing; <div class="bookquote">``at any rate
he (<font color='blue'><b>Doctor</b></font>) hasn't got them yet, or he (<font color='blue'><b>Doctor</b></font>) wouldn't have been such a flat to-night as
to let Jack Raggles go in out of his (<font color='blue'><b>Raggles</b></font>) turn.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Tom/Brown/Tom Brown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Ah, the Doctor never would have done that,''  (<font color='red'><b>Arthur/George/George Arthur</b></font>)</div>said Arthur demurely. <div class="bookquote">``Tom,
you've a great deal to learn yet in the art of ruling.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Well, I wish you'd tell the Doctor so then, and get him (<font color='blue'><b>Doctor</b></font>) to let me stop
till I'm twenty. I don't want to leave, I'm sure.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``What a sight it is,''  (<font color='red'><b>the master</b></font>)</div>broke in the master, <div class="bookquote">``the Doctor as a ruler!
Perhaps ours is the only little corner of the British Empire which
is thoroughly, wisely, and strongly ruled just now. I'm more and more
thankful every day of my life that I came here to be under him (<font color='blue'><b>Doctor</b></font>).''

 (<font color='red'><b>the master</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``So am I, I'm sure,''  (<font color='red'><b>Tom/Brown/Tom Brown</b></font>)</div>said Tom, <div class="bookquote">``and more and more sorry that I've got to
leave.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Tom/Brown/Tom Brown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Every place and thing one sees here reminds one of some wise act of
his (<font color='blue'><b>Doctor</b></font>),''  (<font color='red'><b>the master</b></font>)</div>went on the master. <div class="bookquote">``This island now--you remember the time,
Brown, when it was laid out in small gardens, and cultivated by
frost-bitten fags in February and March?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Of course I do,''  (<font color='red'><b>Tom/Brown/Tom Brown</b></font>)</div>said Tom; <div class="bookquote">``didn't I hate spending two hours in the
afternoon grubbing in the tough dirt with the stump of a fives bat? But
turf-cart was good fun enough.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Tom/Brown/Tom Brown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I dare say it was, but it was always leading to fights with the
townspeople; and then the stealing flowers out of all the gardens in
Rugby for the Easter show was abominable.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Well, so it was,''  (<font color='red'><b>Tom/Brown/Tom Brown</b></font>)</div>said Tom, looking down, <div class="bookquote">``but we fags couldn't help
ourselves. But what has that to do with the Doctor's ruling?''

 (<font color='red'><b>Tom/Brown/Tom Brown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``A great deal, I think,''  (<font color='red'><b>the master</b></font>)</div>said the master; <div class="bookquote">``what brought island-fagging
to an end?''

 (<font color='red'><b>the master</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Why, the Easter speeches were put off till midsummer,''  (<font color='red'><b>Tom/Brown/Tom Brown</b></font>)</div>said Tom, <div class="bookquote">``and
the sixth had the gymnastic poles put up here.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Tom/Brown/Tom Brown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Well, and who changed the time of the speeches, and put the idea of
gymnastic poles into the heads of their worships the sixth form?''  (<font color='red'><b>the master</b></font>)</div>said
the master.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``The Doctor, I suppose,''  (<font color='red'><b>Tom/Brown/Tom Brown</b></font>)</div>said Tom. <div class="bookquote">``I never thought of that.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Of course you didn't,''  (<font color='red'><b>the master</b></font>)</div>said the master, <div class="bookquote">``or else, fag as you were,
you would have shouted with the whole school against putting down old
customs. And that's the way that all the Doctor's reforms have been
carried out when he (<font color='blue'><b>Doctor</b></font>) has been left to himself--quietly and naturally,
putting a good thing in the place of a bad, and letting the bad die out;
no wavering, and no hurry--the best thing that could be done for the
time being, and patience for the rest.''

 (<font color='red'><b>the master</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Just Tom's own way,''  (<font color='red'><b>Arthur/George/George Arthur</b></font>)</div>chimed in Arthur, nudging Tom with his (<font color='blue'><b>Tom</b></font>)
elbow--<div class="bookquote">``driving a nail where it will go;''  (<font color='red'><b>Tom/Brown/Tom Brown</b></font>)</div>to which allusion Tom answered
by a sly kick.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Exactly so,''  (<font color='red'><b>the master</b></font>)</div>said the master, innocent of the allusion and by-play.

<p/>Meantime Jack Raggles, with his (<font color='blue'><b>Raggles</b></font>) sleeves tucked up above his (<font color='blue'><b>Raggles</b></font>) great brown
elbows, scorning pads and gloves, has presented himself at the wicket;
and having run one for a forward drive of Johnson's, is about to receive
his (<font color='blue'><b>Johnson</b></font>) first ball. There are only twenty-four runs to make, and four
wickets to go down--a winning match if they play decently steady. The
ball is a very swift one, and rises fast, catching Jack on the outside
of the thigh, and bounding away as if from india-rubber, while they
run two for a leg-bye amidst great applause and shouts from Jack's many
admirers. The next ball is a beautifully-pitched ball for the outer
stump, which the reckless and unfeeling Jack catches hold of, and hits
right round to leg for five, while the applause becomes deafening. Only
seventeen runs to get with four wickets! The game is all but ours!

<p/>It is over now, and Jack walks swaggering about his (<font color='blue'><b>Jack</b></font>) wicket, with his (<font color='blue'><b>Jack</b></font>) bat
over his (<font color='blue'><b>Jack</b></font>) shoulder, while Mr. Aislabie holds a short parley with his (<font color='blue'><b>Aislabie</b></font>)
men. Then the cover-point hitter, that cunning man, goes on to bowl slow
twisters. Jack waves his (<font color='blue'><b>Jack</b></font>) hand triumphantly towards the tent, as much as
to say, <div class="bookquote">``See if I don't finish it all off now in three hits.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Jack/Jack Raggles</b></font>)</div><p/>Alas, my son Jack, the enemy is too old for thee. The first ball of the
over Jack steps out and meets, swiping with all his (<font color='blue'><b>Jack</b></font>) force. If he (<font color='blue'><b>Jack</b></font>) had
only allowed for the twist! But he (<font color='blue'><b>Jack</b></font>) hasn't, and so the ball goes spinning
up straight in the air, as if it would never come down again. Away runs
Jack, shouting and trusting to the chapter of accidents; but the bowler
runs steadily under it, judging every spin, and calling out, <div class="bookquote">``I have
it,''  (<font color='red'><b>the bowler</b></font>)</div>catches it, and playfully pitches it on to the back of the stalwart
Jack, who is departing with a rueful countenance.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``I knew how it would be,''  (<font color='red'><b>Tom/Brown/Tom Brown</b></font>)</div>says Tom, rising. <div class="bookquote">``Come along; the game's
getting very serious.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/>So they leave the island and go to the tent; and after deep
consultation, Arthur is sent in, and goes off to the wicket with a last
exhortation from Tom to play steady and keep his (<font color='blue'><b>Tom</b></font>) bat straight. To the
suggestions that Winter is the best bat left, Tom only replies, <div class="bookquote">``Arthur
is the steadiest, and Johnson will make the runs if the wicket is only
kept up.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Tom/Brown/Tom Brown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I am surprised to see Arthur in the eleven,''  (<font color='red'><b>the master</b></font>)</div>said the master, as they
stood together in front of the dense crowd, which was now closing in
round the ground.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Well, I'm not quite sure that he (<font color='blue'><b>Arthur</b></font>) ought to be in for his (<font color='blue'><b>Arthur</b></font>) play,''  (<font color='red'><b>Tom/Brown/Tom Brown</b></font>)</div>said
Tom, <div class="bookquote">``but I couldn't help putting him (<font color='blue'><b>Arthur</b></font>) in. It will do him (<font color='blue'><b>Arthur</b></font>) so much good,
and you can't think what I owe him (<font color='blue'><b>Arthur</b></font>).''

 (<font color='red'><b>Tom/Brown/Tom Brown</b></font>)</div><p/>The master smiled. The clock strikes eight, and the whole field becomes
fevered with excitement. Arthur, after two narrow escapes, scores one,
and Johnson gets the ball. The bowling and fielding are superb, and
Johnson's batting worthy the occasion. He (<font color='blue'><b>Johnson</b></font>) makes here a two, and there a
one, managing to keep the ball to himself, and Arthur backs up and runs
perfectly. Only eleven runs to make now, and the crowd scarcely breathe.
At last Arthur gets the ball again, and actually drives it forward
for two, and feels prouder than when he (<font color='blue'><b>Arthur</b></font>) got the three best prizes, at
hearing Tom's shout of joy, <div class="bookquote">``Well played, well played, young un!''

 (<font color='red'><b>Tom/Brown/Tom Brown</b></font>)</div><p/>But the next ball is too much for the young hand, and his (<font color='blue'><b>Tom</b></font>) bails fly
different ways. Nine runs to make, and two wickets to go down: it is too
much for human nerves.

<p/>Before Winter can get in, the omnibus which is to take the Lord's men
to the train pulls up at the side of the close, and Mr. Aislabie and Tom
consult, and give out that the stumps will be drawn after the next over.
And so ends the great match. Winter and Johnson carry out their bats,
and, it being a one day's match, the Lord's men are declared the
winners, they having scored the most in the first innings.

<p/>But such a defeat is a victory: so think Tom and all the School eleven,
as they accompany their conquerors to the omnibus, and send them off
with three ringing cheers, after Mr. Aislabie has shaken hands all
round, saying to Tom, <div class="bookquote">``I must compliment you, sir, on your eleven, and I
hope we shall have you for a member if you come up to town.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Tom/Brown/Tom Brown</b></font>)</div><p/>As Tom and the rest of the eleven were turning back into the close, and
everybody was beginning to cry out for another country-dance, encouraged
by the success of the night before, the young master, who was just
leaving the close, stopped him (<font color='blue'><b>master</b></font>), and asked him (<font color='blue'><b>master</b></font>) to come up to tea at
half-past eight, adding, <div class="bookquote">``I won't keep you more than half an hour, and
ask Arthur to come up too.''

 (<font color='red'><b>him</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I'll come up with you directly, if you'll let me,''  (<font color='red'><b>Tom/Brown/Tom Brown</b></font>)</div>said Tom, <div class="bookquote">``for I
feel rather melancholy, and not quite up to the country-dance and supper
with the rest.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Tom/Brown/Tom Brown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Do, by all means,''  (<font color='red'><b>the master</b></font>)</div>said the master; <div class="bookquote">``I'll wait here for you.''

 (<font color='red'><b>the master</b></font>)</div><p/>So Tom went off to get his (<font color='blue'><b>Tom</b></font>) boots and things from the tent, to tell
Arthur of the invitation, and to speak to his (<font color='blue'><b>Arthur</b></font>) second in command about
stopping the dancing and shutting up the close as soon as it grew dusk.
Arthur promised to follow as soon as he (<font color='blue'><b>Arthur</b></font>) had had a dance. So Tom handed
his (<font color='blue'><b>Tom</b></font>) things over to the man in charge of the tent, and walked quietly
away to the gate where the master was waiting, and the two took their
way together up the Hillmorton road.

<p/>Of course they found the master's house locked up, and all the servants
away in the close--about this time, no doubt, footing it away on the
grass, with extreme delight to themselves, and in utter oblivion of the
unfortunate bachelor their master, whose one enjoyment in the shape
of meals was his (<font color='blue'><b>master</b></font>) <div class="bookquote">``dish of tea''  (<font color='red'><b>master dish</b></font>)</div>-LRB-as our grandmothers called it-RRB- in the
evening; and the phrase was apt in his (<font color='blue'><b>master</b></font>) case, for he (<font color='blue'><b>master</b></font>) always poured his (<font color='blue'><b>master</b></font>)
out into the saucer before drinking. Great was the good man's horror at
finding himself shut out of his (<font color='blue'><b>Great</b></font>) own house. Had he (<font color='blue'><b>Great</b></font>) been alone he (<font color='blue'><b>Great</b></font>)
would have treated it as a matter of course, and would have strolled
contentedly up and down his (<font color='blue'><b>Great</b></font>) gravel walk until some one came home; but he (<font color='blue'><b>Great</b></font>)
was hurt at the stain on his (<font color='blue'><b>Great</b></font>) character of host, especially as the guest
was a pupil. However, the guest seemed to think it a great joke, and
presently, as they poked about round the house, mounted a wall, from
which he (<font color='blue'><b>guest</b></font>) could reach a passage window. The window, as it turned out, was
not bolted, so in another minute Tom was in the house and down at the
front door, which he (<font color='blue'><b>Tom</b></font>) opened from inside. The master chuckled grimly at
this burglarious entry, and insisted on leaving the hall-door and two
of the front windows open, to frighten the truants on their return; and
then the two set about foraging for tea, in which operation the master
was much at fault, having the faintest possible idea of where to find
anything, and being, moreover, wondrously short-sighted; but Tom, by a
sort of instinct, knew the right cupboards in the kitchen and pantry,
and soon managed to place on the snuggery table better materials for a
meal than had appeared there probably during the reign of his (<font color='blue'><b>Tom</b></font>) tutor, who
was then and there initiated, amongst other things, into the excellence
of that mysterious condiment, a dripping-cake. The cake was newly baked,
and all rich and flaky; Tom had found it reposing in the cook's private
cupboard, awaiting her (<font color='blue'><b>Tom</b></font>) return; and as a warning to her (<font color='blue'><b>Tom</b></font>) they finished
it to the last crumb. The kettle sang away merrily on the hob of the
snuggery, for, notwithstanding the time of year, they lighted a fire,
throwing both the windows wide open at the same time; the heaps of books
and papers were pushed away to the other end of the table, and the great
solitary engraving of King's College Chapel over the mantelpiece looked
less stiff than usual, as they settled themselves down in the twilight
to the serious drinking of tea.

<p/>After some talk on the match, and other indifferent subjects, the
conversation came naturally back to Tom's approaching departure, over
which he (<font color='blue'><b>Tom</b></font>) began again to make his (<font color='blue'><b>Tom</b></font>) moan.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Well, we shall all miss you quite as much as you will miss us,''  (<font color='red'><b>the master</b></font>)</div>said
the master. <div class="bookquote">``You are the Nestor of the School now, are you not?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Yes, ever since East left,''  (<font color='red'><b>Tom/Brown/Tom Brown</b></font>)</div>answered Tom. <div class="bookquote">``By-the-bye, have you heard
from him (<font color='blue'><b>Nestor</b></font>)?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Yes, I had a letter in February, just before he (<font color='blue'><b>Nestor</b></font>) started for India to
join his (<font color='blue'><b>Nestor</b></font>) regiment.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``He (<font color='blue'><b>Nestor</b></font>) will make a capital officer.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Ay, won't he (<font color='blue'><b>Nestor</b></font>)!''  (<font color='red'><b>Tom/Brown/Tom Brown</b></font>)</div>said Tom, brightening. <div class="bookquote">``No fellow could handle boys
better, and I suppose soldiers are very like boys. And he (<font color='blue'><b>fellow</b></font>)'ll never tell
them to go where he (<font color='blue'><b>fellow</b></font>) won't go himself. No mistake about that. A braver
fellow never walked.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``His (<font color='blue'><b>fellow</b></font>) year in the sixth will have taught him (<font color='blue'><b>fellow</b></font>) a good deal that will be
useful to him (<font color='blue'><b>fellow</b></font>) now.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/>``So it will,''' said Tom, staring into the fire. ``Poor dear Harry,'' he (<font color='blue'><b>Tom</b></font>)
went on--<div class="bookquote">``how well I remember the day we were put out of the twenty! How
he (<font color='blue'><b>Tom</b></font>) rose to the situation, and burnt his (<font color='blue'><b>Tom</b></font>) cigar-cases, and gave away his (<font color='blue'><b>Tom</b></font>)
pistols, and pondered on the constitutional authority of the sixth, and
his (<font color='blue'><b>Tom</b></font>) new duties to the Doctor, and the fifth form, and the fags! Ay, and
no fellow ever acted up to them better, though he (<font color='blue'><b>fellow</b></font>) was always a people's
man--for the fags, and against constituted authorities. He (<font color='blue'><b>fellow</b></font>) couldn't
help that, you know. I'm sure the Doctor must have liked him (<font color='blue'><b>Doctor</b></font>)?''  (<font color='red'><b>Harry/Harry Winburn</b></font>)</div>said Tom,
looking up inquiringly.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``The Doctor sees the good in every one, and appreciates it,''  (<font color='red'><b>the master</b></font>)</div>said the
master dogmatically; <div class="bookquote">``but I hope East will get a good colonel. He (<font color='blue'><b>colonel</b></font>) won't
do if he (<font color='blue'><b>colonel</b></font>) can't respect those above him (<font color='blue'><b>colonel</b></font>). How long it took him (<font color='blue'><b>colonel</b></font>), even here,
to learn the lesson of obeying!''

 (<font color='red'><b>the master</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Well, I wish I were alongside of him (<font color='blue'><b>colonel</b></font>),''  (<font color='red'><b>Tom/Brown/Tom Brown</b></font>)</div>said Tom. <div class="bookquote">``If I can't be at
Rugby, I want to be at work in the world, and not dawdling away three
years at Oxford.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``What do you mean by `at work in the world'?''  (<font color='red'><b>the master</b></font>)</div>said the master, pausing
with his (<font color='blue'><b>Tom</b></font>) lips close to his (<font color='blue'><b>Tom</b></font>) saucerful of tea, and peering at Tom over it.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Well, I mean real work--one's profession--whatever one will have really
to do and make one's living by. I want to be doing some real good,
feeling that I am not only at play in the world,''  (<font color='red'><b>Tom/Brown/Tom Brown</b></font>)</div>answered Tom, rather
puzzled to find out himself what he (<font color='blue'><b>Tom</b></font>) really did mean.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``You are mixing up two very different things in your head, I think,
Brown,''  (<font color='red'><b>the master</b></font>)</div>said the master, putting down the empty saucer, <div class="bookquote">``and you ought
to get clear about them. You talk of `working to get your living,' and
`doing some real good in the world,' in the same breath. Now, you may be
getting a very good living in a profession, and yet doing no good at all
in the world, but quite the contrary, at the same time. Keep the latter
before you as your one object, and you will be right, whether you make
a living or not; but if you dwell on the other, you'll very likely drop
into mere money-making, and let the world take care of itself for good
or evil. Don't be in a hurry about finding your work in the world for
yourself--you are not old enough to judge for yourself yet; but just
look about you in the place you find yourself in, and try to make things
a little better and honester there. You'll find plenty to keep your hand
in at Oxford, or wherever else you go. And don't be led away to think
this part of the world important and that unimportant. Every corner of
the world is important. No man knows whether this part or that is most
so, but every man may do some honest work in his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) own corner.''  (<font color='red'><b>the master</b></font>)</div>And then
the good man went on to talk wisely to Tom of the sort of work which
he (<font color='blue'><b>Tom</b></font>) might take up as an undergraduate, and warned him (<font color='blue'><b>Tom</b></font>) of the prevalent
university sins, and explained to him (<font color='blue'><b>Tom</b></font>) the many and great differences
between university and school life, till the twilight changed into
darkness, and they heard the truant servants stealing in by the back
entrance.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``I wonder where Arthur can be,''  (<font color='red'><b>Tom/Brown/Tom Brown</b></font>)</div>said Tom at last, looking at his (<font color='blue'><b>Tom</b></font>) watch;
<div class="bookquote">``why, it's nearly half-past nine already.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Tom/Brown/Tom Brown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Oh, he (<font color='blue'><b>Arthur</b></font>) is comfortably at supper with the eleven, forgetful of his (<font color='blue'><b>Arthur</b></font>)
oldest friends,''  (<font color='red'><b>the master</b></font>)</div>said the master. <div class="bookquote">``Nothing has given me greater
pleasure,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Tom</b></font>) went on, <div class="bookquote">``than your friendship for him (<font color='blue'><b>Arthur</b></font>); it has been the
making of you both.''

 (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Of me, at any rate,''  (<font color='red'><b>Tom/Brown/Tom Brown</b></font>)</div>answered Tom; <div class="bookquote">``I should never have been here now
but for him (<font color='blue'><b>Arthur</b></font>). It was the luckiest chance in the world that sent him (<font color='blue'><b>Arthur</b></font>) to
Rugby and made him (<font color='blue'><b>Arthur</b></font>) my chum.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Tom/Brown/Tom Brown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Why do you talk of lucky chances?''  (<font color='red'><b>the master</b></font>)</div>said the master. <div class="bookquote">``I don't know that
there are any such things in the world; at any rate, there was neither
luck nor chance in that matter.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Tom/Brown/Tom Brown</b></font>)</div><p/>Tom looked at him (<font color='blue'><b>Tom</b></font>) inquiringly, and he (<font color='blue'><b>Tom</b></font>) went on. <div class="bookquote">``Do you remember when the
Doctor lectured you and East at the end of one half-year, when you were
in the shell, and had been getting into all sorts of scrapes?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Yes, well enough,''  (<font color='red'><b>Tom/Brown/Tom Brown</b></font>)</div>said Tom; <div class="bookquote">``it was the half-year before Arthur came.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Tom/Brown/Tom Brown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Exactly so,''  (<font color='red'><b>the master</b></font>)</div>answered the master. <div class="bookquote">``Now, I was with him (<font color='blue'><b>Arthur</b></font>) a few minutes
afterwards, and he (<font color='blue'><b>Arthur</b></font>) was in great distress about you two. And after some
talk, we both agreed that you in particular wanted some object in the
School beyond games and mischief; for it was quite clear that you never
would make the regular school work your first object. And so the Doctor,
at the beginning of the next half-year, looked out the best of the new
boys, and separated you and East, and put the young boy into your study,
in the hope that when you had somebody to lean on you, you would
begin to stand a little steadier yourself, and get manliness and
thoughtfulness. And I can assure you he (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>) has watched the experiment ever
since with great satisfaction. Ah! not one of you boys will ever know
the anxiety you have given him (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>), or the care with which he (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>) has watched
over every step in your school lives.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Tom/Brown/Tom Brown</b></font>)</div><p/>Up to this time Tom had never given wholly in to or understood the
Doctor. At first he (<font color='blue'><b>Tom</b></font>) had thoroughly feared him (<font color='blue'><b>Tom</b></font>). For some years, as I have
tried to show, he (<font color='blue'><b>Tom</b></font>) had learnt to regard him (<font color='blue'><b>Tom</b></font>) with love and respect, and
to think him (<font color='blue'><b>Tom</b></font>) a very great and wise and good man. But as regarded his (<font color='blue'><b>Tom</b></font>) own
position in the School, of which he (<font color='blue'><b>Tom</b></font>) was no little proud, Tom had no idea
of giving any one credit for it but himself, and, truth to tell, was a
very self-conceited young gentleman on the subject. He (<font color='blue'><b>gentleman</b></font>) was wont to boast
that he (<font color='blue'><b>gentleman</b></font>) had fought his (<font color='blue'><b>gentleman</b></font>) own way fairly up the School, and had never made
up to or been taken up by any big fellow or master, and that it was
now quite a different place from what it was when he (<font color='blue'><b>master</b></font>) first came. And,
indeed, though he (<font color='blue'><b>master</b></font>) didn't actually boast of it, yet in his (<font color='blue'><b>master</b></font>) secret soul
he (<font color='blue'><b>master</b></font>) did to a great extent believe that the great reform in the School
had been owing quite as much to himself as to any one else. Arthur,
he (<font color='blue'><b>Arthur</b></font>) acknowledged, had done him (<font color='blue'><b>Arthur</b></font>) good, and taught him (<font color='blue'><b>Arthur</b></font>) a good deal; so had
other boys in different ways, but they had not had the same means of
influence on the School in general. And as for the Doctor, why, he (<font color='blue'><b>Doctor</b></font>) was
a splendid master; but every one knew that masters could do very little
out of school hours. In short, he (<font color='blue'><b>Doctor</b></font>) felt on terms of equality with his (<font color='blue'><b>Doctor</b></font>)
chief, so far as the social state of the School was concerned, and
thought that the Doctor would find it no easy matter to get on without
him (<font color='blue'><b>Doctor</b></font>). Moreover, his (<font color='blue'><b>Doctor</b></font>) School Toryism was still strong, and he (<font color='blue'><b>Doctor</b></font>) looked still
with some jealousy on the Doctor, as somewhat of a fanatic in the matter
of change, and thought it very desirable for the School that he (<font color='blue'><b>Doctor</b></font>) should
have some wise person -LRB-such as himself-RRB- to look sharply after vested
School-rights, and see that nothing was done to the injury of the
republic without due protest.

<p/>It was a new light to him (<font color='blue'><b>Doctor</b></font>) to find that, besides teaching the sixth, and
governing and guiding the whole School, editing classics, and writing
histories, the great headmaster had found time in those busy years
to watch over the career even of him (<font color='blue'><b>headmaster</b></font>), Tom Brown, and his (<font color='blue'><b>Brown</b></font>) particular
friends, and, no doubt, of fifty other boys at the same time, and all
this without taking the least credit to himself, or seeming to know, or
let any one else know, that he (<font color='blue'><b>Brown</b></font>) ever thought particularly of any boy at
all.

<p/>However, the Doctor's victory was complete from that moment over Tom
Brown at any rate. He (<font color='blue'><b>Brown</b></font>) gave way at all points, and the enemy marched
right over him (<font color='blue'><b>Brown</b></font>)--cavalry, infantry, and artillery, and the land transport
corps, and the camp followers. It had taken eight long years to do it;
but now it was done thoroughly, and there wasn't a corner of him (<font color='blue'><b>Brown</b></font>) left
which didn't believe in the Doctor. Had he (<font color='blue'><b>Doctor</b></font>) returned to School again, and
the Doctor begun the half-year by abolishing fagging, and football, and
the Saturday half-holiday, or all or any of the most cherished School
institutions, Tom would have supported him (<font color='blue'><b>Tom</b></font>) with the blindest faith. And
so, after a half confession of his (<font color='blue'><b>Tom</b></font>) previous shortcomings, and sorrowful
adieus to his (<font color='blue'><b>Tom</b></font>) tutor, from whom he (<font color='blue'><b>Tom</b></font>) received two beautifully-bound volumes
of the Doctor's sermons, as a parting present, he (<font color='blue'><b>Doctor</b></font>) marched down to the
Schoolhouse, a hero-worshipper, who would have satisfied the soul of
Thomas Carlyle himself.

<p/>There he (<font color='blue'><b>Thomas</b></font>) found the eleven at high jinks after supper, Jack Raggles
shouting comic songs and performing feats of strength, and was greeted
by a chorus of mingled remonstrance at his (<font color='blue'><b>Raggles</b></font>) desertion and joy at his (<font color='blue'><b>Raggles</b></font>)
reappearance. And falling in with the humour of the evening, he (<font color='blue'><b>Raggles</b></font>) was soon
as great a boy as all the rest; and at ten o’clock was chaired round
the quadrangle, on one of the hall benches, borne aloft by the eleven,
shouting in chorus, <div class="bookquote">``For he (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>)'s a jolly good fellow,''  (<font color='red'><b>a boy</b></font>)</div>while old Thomas, in
a melting mood, and the other School-house servants, stood looking on.

<p/>And the next morning after breakfast he (<font color='blue'><b>Thomas</b></font>) squared up all the cricketing
accounts, went round to his (<font color='blue'><b>Thomas</b></font>) tradesmen and other acquaintance, and said
his (<font color='blue'><b>Thomas</b></font>) hearty good-byes; and by twelve o’clock was in the train, and away
for London, no longer a school-boy, and divided in his (<font color='blue'><b>Thomas</b></font>) thoughts between
hero-worship, honest regrets over the long stage of his (<font color='blue'><b>Thomas</b></font>) life which was
now slipping out of sight behind him (<font color='blue'><b>Thomas</b></font>), and hopes and resolves for the
next stage upon which he (<font color='blue'><b>Thomas</b></font>) was entering with all the confidence of a young
traveller.



<p/>CHAPTER IX--FINIS.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Strange friend, past, present, and to be;
Loved deeplier, darklier understood;
Behold I dream a dream of good,
And mingle all the world with thee.'' (<font color='red'><b>TENNYSON</b></font>)</div>--TENNYSON.

<p/>In the summer of 1842, our hero stopped once again at the well-known
station; and leaving his (<font color='blue'><b>hero</b></font>) bag and fishing-rod with a porter, walked
slowly and sadly up towards the town. It was now July. He (<font color='blue'><b>hero</b></font>) had rushed
away from Oxford the moment that term was over, for a fishing ramble in
Scotland with two college friends, and had been for three weeks living
on oatcake, mutton-hams, and whisky, in the wildest parts of Skye. They
had descended one sultry evening on the little inn at Kyle Rhea ferry;
and while Tom and another of the party put their tackle together
and began exploring the stream for a sea-trout for supper, the third
strolled into the house to arrange for their entertainment. Presently he (<font color='blue'><b>Tom</b></font>)
came out in a loose blouse and slippers, a short pipe in his (<font color='blue'><b>Tom</b></font>) mouth, and
an old newspaper in his (<font color='blue'><b>Tom</b></font>) hand, and threw himself on the heathery scrub
which met the shingle, within easy hail of the fishermen. There he (<font color='blue'><b>Tom</b></font>) lay,
the picture of free-and-easy, loafing, hand-to-mouth young England,
<div class="bookquote">``improving his (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>) mind,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>as he (<font color='blue'><b>Tom</b></font>) shouted to them, by the perusal of the
fortnight-old weekly paper, soiled with the marks of toddy-glasses and
tobacco-ashes, the legacy of the last traveller, which he (<font color='blue'><b>traveller</b></font>) had hunted
out from the kitchen of the little hostelry, and, being a youth of
a communicative turn of mind, began imparting the contents to the
fishermen as he (<font color='blue'><b>traveller</b></font>) went on.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``What a bother they are making about these wretched corn-laws! Here's
three or four columns full of nothing but sliding scales and fixed
duties. Hang this tobacco, it's always going out! Ah, here's something
better--a splendid match between Kent and England, Brown, Kent winning
by three wickets. Felix fifty-six runs without a chance, and not out!''

 (<font color='red'><b>Tom/Brown/Tom Brown</b></font>)</div><p/>Tom, intent on a fish which had risen at him (<font color='blue'><b>Tom</b></font>) twice, answered only with a
grunt.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Anything about the Goodwood?''  (<font color='red'><b>the man</b></font>)</div>called out the third man.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Rory O’More drawn. Butterfly colt amiss,''  (<font color='red'><b>the student</b></font>)</div>shouted the student.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Just my luck,''  (<font color='red'><b>the inquirer</b></font>)</div>grumbled the inquirer, jerking his (<font color='blue'><b>student</b></font>) flies off the water,
and throwing again with a heavy, sullen splash, and frightening Tom's
fish.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``I say, can't you throw lighter over there? We ain't fishing for
grampuses,''  (<font color='red'><b>Tom/Brown/Tom Brown</b></font>)</div>shouted Tom across the stream.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Hullo, Brown! here's something for you,''  (<font color='red'><b>the reading man moment</b></font>)</div>called out the reading man
next moment. <div class="bookquote">``Why, your old master, Arnold of Rugby, is dead.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Tom/Brown/Tom Brown</b></font>)</div><p/>Tom's hand stopped half-way in his (<font color='blue'><b>Tom</b></font>) cast, and his (<font color='blue'><b>Tom</b></font>) line and flies went all
tangling round and round his (<font color='blue'><b>Tom</b></font>) rod; you might have knocked him (<font color='blue'><b>Tom</b></font>) over with a
feather. Neither of his (<font color='blue'><b>Tom</b></font>) companions took any notice of him (<font color='blue'><b>Tom</b></font>), luckily; and
with a violent effort he (<font color='blue'><b>Tom</b></font>) set to work mechanically to disentangle his (<font color='blue'><b>Tom</b></font>)
line. He (<font color='blue'><b>Tom</b></font>) felt completely carried off his (<font color='blue'><b>Tom</b></font>) moral and intellectual legs, as
if he (<font color='blue'><b>Tom</b></font>) had lost his (<font color='blue'><b>Tom</b></font>) standing-point in the invisible world. Besides which,
the deep, loving loyalty which he (<font color='blue'><b>Tom</b></font>) felt for his (<font color='blue'><b>Tom</b></font>) old leader made the shock
intensely painful. It was the first great wrench of his (<font color='blue'><b>Tom</b></font>) life, the first
gap which the angel Death had made in his (<font color='blue'><b>Tom</b></font>) circle, and he (<font color='blue'><b>Tom</b></font>) felt numbed,
and beaten down, and spiritless. Well, well! I believe it was good for
him (<font color='blue'><b>Tom</b></font>) and for many others in like case, who had to learn by that loss
that the soul of man cannot stand or lean upon any human prop, however
strong, and wise, and good; but that He (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) upon whom alone it can stand and
lean will knock away all such props in His (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) own wise and merciful way,
until there is no ground or stay left but Himself, the Rock of Ages,
upon whom alone a sure foundation for every soul of man is laid.

<p/>As he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) wearily laboured at his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) line, the thought struck him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>), <div class="bookquote">``It may
be all false--a mere newspaper lie.''  (<font color='red'><b>him</b></font>)</div>And he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) strode up to the recumbent
smoker.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Let me look at the paper,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>said he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>).

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Nothing else in it,''  (<font color='red'><b>him</b></font>)</div>answered the other, handing it up to him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>)
listlessly. <div class="bookquote">``Hullo, Brown! what's the matter, old fellow? Ain't you
well?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Where is it?''  (<font color='red'><b>Tom/Brown/Tom Brown</b></font>)</div>said Tom, turning over the leaves, his (<font color='blue'><b>Tom</b></font>) hands trembling,
and his (<font color='blue'><b>Tom</b></font>) eyes swimming, so that he (<font color='blue'><b>Tom</b></font>) could not read.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``What? What are you looking for?''  (<font color='red'><b>friend</b></font>)</div>said his (<font color='blue'><b>Tom</b></font>) friend, jumping up and
looking over his (<font color='blue'><b>Tom</b></font>) shoulder.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``That--about Arnold,''  (<font color='red'><b>Tom/Brown/Tom Brown</b></font>)</div>said Tom.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Oh, here,''  (<font color='red'><b>Tom/Brown/Tom Brown</b></font>)</div>said the other, putting his (<font color='blue'><b>Tom</b></font>) finger on the paragraph. Tom
read it over and over again. There could be no mistake of identity,
though the account was short enough.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Thank you,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>said he (<font color='blue'><b>Tom</b></font>) at last, dropping the paper. <div class="bookquote">``I shall go for a
walk. Don't you and Herbert wait supper for me.''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>And away he (<font color='blue'><b>Tom</b></font>) strode,
up over the moor at the back of the house, to be alone, and master his (<font color='blue'><b>Tom</b></font>)
grief if possible.

<p/>His (<font color='blue'><b>Tom</b></font>) friend looked after him (<font color='blue'><b>Tom</b></font>), sympathizing and wondering, and, knocking
the ashes out of his (<font color='blue'><b>Tom</b></font>) pipe, walked over to Herbert. After a short parley
they walked together up to the house.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``I'm afraid that confounded newspaper has spoiled Brown's fun for this
trip.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``How odd that he (<font color='blue'><b>Brown</b></font>) should be so fond of his (<font color='blue'><b>Brown</b></font>) old master,''  (<font color='red'><b>Herbert</b></font>)</div>said Herbert. Yet
they also were both public-school men.

<p/>The two, however, notwithstanding Tom's prohibition, waited supper
for him (<font color='blue'><b>Tom</b></font>), and had everything ready when he (<font color='blue'><b>Tom</b></font>) came back some half an hour
afterwards. But he (<font color='blue'><b>Tom</b></font>) could not join in their cheerful talk, and the party
was soon silent, notwithstanding the efforts of all three. One thing
only had Tom resolved, and that was, that he (<font color='blue'><b>Tom</b></font>) couldn't stay in Scotland
any longer: he (<font color='blue'><b>Tom</b></font>) felt an irresistible longing to get to Rugby, and then
home, and soon broke it to the others, who had too much tact to oppose.

<p/>So by daylight the next morning he (<font color='blue'><b>Tom</b></font>) was marching through Ross-shire,
and in the evening hit the Caledonian Canal, took the next steamer,
and travelled as fast as boat and railway could carry him (<font color='blue'><b>Tom</b></font>) to the Rugby
station.

<p/>As he (<font color='blue'><b>Tom</b></font>) walked up to the town, he (<font color='blue'><b>Tom</b></font>) felt shy and afraid of being seen,
and took the back streets--why, he (<font color='blue'><b>Tom</b></font>) didn't know, but he (<font color='blue'><b>Tom</b></font>) followed his (<font color='blue'><b>Tom</b></font>)
instinct. At the School-gates he (<font color='blue'><b>Tom</b></font>) made a dead pause; there was not a soul
in the quadrangle--all was lonely, and silent, and sad. So with another
effort he (<font color='blue'><b>Tom</b></font>) strode through the quadrangle, and into the School-house
offices.

<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Tom</b></font>) found the little matron in her (<font color='blue'><b>matron</b></font>) room in deep mourning; shook her (<font color='blue'><b>matron</b></font>) hand,
tried to talk, and moved nervously about. She (<font color='blue'><b>matron</b></font>) was evidently thinking of
the same subject as he (<font color='blue'><b>Tom</b></font>), but he (<font color='blue'><b>Tom</b></font>) couldn't begin talking.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Where shall I find Thomas?''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>said he (<font color='blue'><b>Tom</b></font>) at last, getting desperate.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``In the servants' hall, I think, sir. But won't you take anything?''  (<font color='red'><b>the matron</b></font>)</div>said
the matron, looking rather disappointed.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``No, thank you,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>said he (<font color='blue'><b>Tom</b></font>), and strode off again to find the old
verger, who was sitting in his (<font color='blue'><b>Tom</b></font>) little den, as of old, puzzling over
hieroglyphics.

<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Tom</b></font>) looked up through his (<font color='blue'><b>Tom</b></font>) spectacles as Tom seized his (<font color='blue'><b>Tom</b></font>) hand and wrung it.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Ah! you've heard all about it, sir, I see,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>said he (<font color='blue'><b>Tom</b></font>). Tom nodded, and
then sat down on the shoe-board, while the old man told his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) tale, and
wiped his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) spectacles, and fairly flowed over with quaint, homely, honest
sorrow.

<p/>By the time he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) had done Tom felt much better.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Where is he (<font color='blue'><b>Thomas</b></font>) buried, Thomas?''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>said he (<font color='blue'><b>Tom</b></font>) at last.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Under the altar in the chapel, sir,''  (<font color='red'><b>Thomas/Thomas Hughes</b></font>)</div>answered Thomas. <div class="bookquote">``You'd like to
have the key, I dare say?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Thank you, Thomas--yes, I should, very much.''

 (<font color='red'><b>the man</b></font>)</div><p/>And the old man fumbled among his (<font color='blue'><b>Thomas</b></font>) bunch, and then got up, as though
he (<font color='blue'><b>Thomas</b></font>) would go with him (<font color='blue'><b>Thomas</b></font>); but after a few steps stopped short, and said,
<div class="bookquote">``Perhaps you'd like to go by yourself, sir?''

 (<font color='red'><b>him</b></font>)</div><p/>Tom nodded, and the bunch of keys were handed to him (<font color='blue'><b>Tom</b></font>), with an injunction
to be sure and lock the door after him (<font color='blue'><b>Tom</b></font>), and bring them back before eight
o’clock.

<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Tom</b></font>) walked quickly through the quadrangle and out into the close. The
longing which had been upon him (<font color='blue'><b>Tom</b></font>) and driven him (<font color='blue'><b>Tom</b></font>) thus far, like the
gad-fly in the Greek legends, giving him (<font color='blue'><b>Tom</b></font>) no rest in mind or body, seemed
all of a sudden not to be satisfied, but to shrivel up and pall. <div class="bookquote">``Why
should I go on? It's no use,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Tom</b></font>) thought, and threw himself at full
length on the turf, and looked vaguely and listlessly at all the
well-known objects. There were a few of the town boys playing cricket,
their wicket pitched on the best piece in the middle of the big-side
ground--a sin about equal to sacrilege in the eyes of a captain of the
eleven. He (<font color='blue'><b>captain</b></font>) was very nearly getting up to go and send them off. <div class="bookquote">``Pshaw!
they won't remember me. They've more right there than I,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>captain</b></font>) muttered.
And the thought that his (<font color='blue'><b>captain</b></font>) sceptre had departed, and his (<font color='blue'><b>captain</b></font>) mark was wearing
out, came home to him (<font color='blue'><b>captain</b></font>) for the first time, and bitterly enough. He (<font color='blue'><b>captain</b></font>) was
lying on the very spot where the fights came off--where he (<font color='blue'><b>captain</b></font>) himself had
fought six years ago his (<font color='blue'><b>captain</b></font>) first and last battle. He (<font color='blue'><b>captain</b></font>) conjured up the scene
till he (<font color='blue'><b>captain</b></font>) could almost hear the shouts of the ring, and East's whisper in
his (<font color='blue'><b>captain</b></font>) ear; and looking across the close to the Doctor's private door,
half expected to see it open, and the tall figure in cap and gown come
striding under the elm-trees towards him (<font color='blue'><b>Doctor</b></font>).

<p/>No, no; that sight could never be seen again. There was no flag flying
on the round tower; the School-house windows were all shuttered up; and
when the flag went up again, and the shutters came down, it would be
to welcome a stranger. All that was left on earth of him (<font color='blue'><b>stranger</b></font>) whom he (<font color='blue'><b>stranger</b></font>) had
honoured was lying cold and still under the chapel floor. He (<font color='blue'><b>stranger</b></font>) would go in
and see the place once more, and then leave it once for all. New men and
new methods might do for other people; let those who would, worship the
rising star; he (<font color='blue'><b>stranger</b></font>), at least, would be faithful to the sun which had
set. And so he (<font color='blue'><b>stranger</b></font>) got up, and walked to the chapel door, and unlocked it,
fancying himself the only mourner in all the broad land, and feeding on
his (<font color='blue'><b>mourner</b></font>) own selfish sorrow.

<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>mourner</b></font>) passed through the vestibule, and then paused for a moment to glance
over the empty benches. His (<font color='blue'><b>mourner</b></font>) heart was still proud and high, and he (<font color='blue'><b>mourner</b></font>)
walked up to the seat which he (<font color='blue'><b>mourner</b></font>) had last occupied as a sixth-form boy,
and sat himself down there to collect his (<font color='blue'><b>mourner</b></font>) thoughts.

<p/>And, truth to tell, they needed collecting and setting in order not a
little. The memories of eight years were all dancing through his (<font color='blue'><b>mourner</b></font>) brain,
and carrying him (<font color='blue'><b>mourner</b></font>) about whither they would; while, beneath them all, his (<font color='blue'><b>mourner</b></font>)
heart was throbbing with the dull sense of a loss that could never be
made up to him (<font color='blue'><b>mourner</b></font>). The rays of the evening sun came solemnly through the
painted windows above his (<font color='blue'><b>mourner</b></font>) head, and fell in gorgeous colours on the
opposite wall, and the perfect stillness soothed his (<font color='blue'><b>mourner</b></font>) spirit by little
and little. And he (<font color='blue'><b>mourner</b></font>) turned to the pulpit, and looked at it, and then,
leaning forward with his (<font color='blue'><b>mourner</b></font>) head on his (<font color='blue'><b>mourner</b></font>) hands, groaned aloud. If he (<font color='blue'><b>mourner</b></font>) could
only have seen the Doctor again for one five minutes--have told him (<font color='blue'><b>mourner</b></font>) all
that was in his (<font color='blue'><b>mourner</b></font>) heart, what he (<font color='blue'><b>mourner</b></font>) owed to him (<font color='blue'><b>mourner</b></font>), how he (<font color='blue'><b>mourner</b></font>) loved and reverenced
him (<font color='blue'><b>mourner</b></font>), and would, by God's help, follow his (<font color='blue'><b>God</b></font>) steps in life and death--he (<font color='blue'><b>God</b></font>)
could have borne it all without a murmur. But that he (<font color='blue'><b>God</b></font>) should have gone
away for ever without knowing it all, was too much to bear. <div class="bookquote">``But am I
sure that he (<font color='blue'><b>Thomas</b></font>) does not know it all?''  (<font color='red'><b>him</b></font>)</div>The thought made him (<font color='blue'><b>God</b></font>) start. <div class="bookquote">``May he (<font color='blue'><b>Thomas</b></font>)
not even now be near me, in this very chapel? If he (<font color='blue'><b>Thomas</b></font>) be, am I sorrowing
as he (<font color='blue'><b>Thomas</b></font>) would have me sorrow, as I should wish to have sorrowed when I
shall meet him (<font color='blue'><b>Thomas</b></font>) again?''

 (<font color='red'><b>He</b></font>)</div><p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>God</b></font>) raised himself up and looked round, and after a minute rose and
walked humbly down to the lowest bench, and sat down on the very seat
which he (<font color='blue'><b>God</b></font>) had occupied on his (<font color='blue'><b>God</b></font>) first Sunday at Rugby. And then the old
memories rushed back again, but softened and subdued, and soothing him (<font color='blue'><b>God</b></font>)
as he (<font color='blue'><b>God</b></font>) let himself be carried away by them. And he (<font color='blue'><b>God</b></font>) looked up at the great
painted window above the altar, and remembered how, when a little boy,
he (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>) used to try not to look through it at the elm-trees and the rooks,
before the painted glass came; and the subscription for the painted
glass, and the letter he (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>) wrote home for money to give to it. And there,
down below, was the very name of the boy who sat on his (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>) right hand on
that first day, scratched rudely in the oak panelling.

<p/>And then came the thought of all his (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>) old schoolfellows; and form after
form of boys nobler, and braver, and purer than he (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>) rose up and seemed to
rebuke him (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>). Could he (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>) not think of them, and what they had felt and were
feeling--they who had honoured and loved from the first the man whom he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>)
had taken years to know and love? Could he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) not think of those yet dearer
to him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) who was gone, who bore his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) name and shared his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) blood, and were
now without a husband or a father? Then the grief which he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) began to
share with others became gentle and holy, and he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) rose up once more, and
walked up the steps to the altar, and while the tears flowed freely down
his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) cheeks, knelt down humbly and hopefully, to lay down there his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) share
of a burden which had proved itself too heavy for him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) to bear in his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) own
strength.

<p/>Here let us leave him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>). Where better could we leave him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) than at the
altar before which he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) had first caught a glimpse of the glory of his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>)
birthright, and felt the drawing of the bond which links all living
souls together in one brotherhood--at the grave beneath the altar of him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>)
who had opened his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) eyes to see that glory, and softened his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) heart till
it could feel that bond?

<p/>And let us not be hard on him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>), if at that moment his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) soul is fuller of
the tomb and him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) who lies there than of the altar and Him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) of whom it
speaks. Such stages have to be gone through, I believe, by all young and
brave souls, who must win their way through hero-worship to the worship
of Him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) who is the King and Lord of heroes. For it is only through our
mysterious human relationships--through the love and tenderness and
purity of mothers and sisters and wives, through the strength and
courage and wisdom of fathers and brothers and teachers--that we can
come to the knowledge of Him (<font color='blue'><b>Lord</b></font>) in whom alone the love, and the tenderness,
and the purity, and the strength, and the courage, and the wisdom of all
these dwell for ever and ever in perfect fullness.
