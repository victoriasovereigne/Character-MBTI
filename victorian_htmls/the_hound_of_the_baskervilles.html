<p/>THE HOUND OF THE BASKERVILLES

<p/>By A. Conan Doyle




<p/>Chapter 1. Mr. Sherlock Holmes



<p/>Mr. Sherlock Holmes, who was usually very late in the mornings, save
upon those not infrequent occasions when he (<font color='blue'><b>Sherlock</b></font>) was up all night, was seated
at the breakfast table. I stood upon the hearth-rug and picked up the
stick which our visitor had left behind him (<font color='blue'><b>visitor</b></font>) the night before. It was a
fine, thick piece of wood, bulbous-headed, of the sort which is known as
a <div class="bookquote">``Penang lawyer.''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>Just under the head was a broad silver band nearly
an inch across. <div class="bookquote">``To James Mortimer, M.R.C.S., from his (<font color='blue'><b>Mortimer</b></font>) friends of the
C.C.H.,''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>was engraved upon it, with the date <div class="bookquote">``1884.''  (<font color='red'><b>family</b></font>)</div>It was just such a
stick as the old-fashioned family practitioner used to carry--dignified,
solid, and reassuring.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Well, Watson, what do you make of it?''

 (<font color='red'><b>Holmes/Mr. Holmes/Sherlock Holmes</b></font>)</div><p/>Holmes was sitting with his (<font color='blue'><b>Holmes</b></font>) back to me, and I had given him (<font color='blue'><b>Holmes</b></font>) no sign of
my occupation.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``How did you know what I was doing? I believe you have eyes in the back
of your head.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I have, at least, a well-polished, silver-plated coffee-pot in front of
me,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>said he (<font color='blue'><b>Holmes</b></font>). <div class="bookquote">``But, tell me, Watson, what do you make of our visitor's
stick? Since we have been so unfortunate as to miss him (<font color='blue'><b>visitor</b></font>) and have no
notion of his (<font color='blue'><b>visitor</b></font>) errand, this accidental souvenir becomes of importance.
Let me hear you reconstruct the man by an examination of it.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I think,''  (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div>said I, following as far as I could the methods of my
companion, <div class="bookquote">``that Dr. Mortimer is a successful, elderly medical man,
well-esteemed since those who know him (<font color='blue'><b>Mortimer</b></font>) give him (<font color='blue'><b>Mortimer</b></font>) this mark of their
appreciation.''

 (<font color='red'><b>companion</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Good!''  (<font color='red'><b>Holmes/Mr. Holmes/Sherlock Holmes</b></font>)</div>said Holmes. <div class="bookquote">``Excellent!''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I think also that the probability is in favour of his (<font color='blue'><b>Mortimer</b></font>) being a country
practitioner who does a great deal of his (<font color='blue'><b>Mortimer</b></font>) visiting on foot.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Why so?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Because this stick, though originally a very handsome one has been so
knocked about that I can hardly imagine a town practitioner carrying it.
The thick-iron ferrule is worn down, so it is evident that he (<font color='blue'><b>practitioner</b></font>) has done a
great amount of walking with it.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Perfectly sound!''  (<font color='red'><b>Holmes/Mr. Holmes/Sherlock Holmes</b></font>)</div>said Holmes.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``And then again, there is the `friends of the C.C.H.' I should guess
that to be the Something Hunt, the local hunt to whose members he (<font color='blue'><b>Hunt</b></font>) has
possibly given some surgical assistance, and which has made him (<font color='blue'><b>Hunt</b></font>) a small
presentation in return.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Really, Watson, you excel yourself,''  (<font color='red'><b>Holmes/Mr. Holmes/Sherlock Holmes</b></font>)</div>said Holmes, pushing back his (<font color='blue'><b>Holmes</b></font>)
chair and lighting a cigarette. <div class="bookquote">``I am bound to say that in all the
accounts which you have been so good as to give of my own small
achievements you have habitually underrated your own abilities. It may
be that you are not yourself luminous, but you are a conductor of
light. Some people without possessing genius have a remarkable power of
stimulating it. I confess, my dear fellow, that I am very much in your
debt.''

 (<font color='red'><b>He</b></font>)</div><p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Holmes</b></font>) had never said as much before, and I must admit that his (<font color='blue'><b>Holmes</b></font>) words gave
me keen pleasure, for I had often been piqued by his (<font color='blue'><b>Holmes</b></font>) indifference to my
admiration and to the attempts which I had made to give publicity to
his (<font color='blue'><b>Holmes</b></font>) methods. I was proud, too, to think that I had so far mastered his (<font color='blue'><b>Holmes</b></font>)
system as to apply it in a way which earned his (<font color='blue'><b>Holmes</b></font>) approval. He (<font color='blue'><b>Holmes</b></font>) now took
the stick from my hands and examined it for a few minutes with his (<font color='blue'><b>Holmes</b></font>) naked
eyes. Then with an expression of interest he (<font color='blue'><b>Holmes</b></font>) laid down his (<font color='blue'><b>Holmes</b></font>) cigarette,
and carrying the cane to the window, he (<font color='blue'><b>Holmes</b></font>) looked over it again with a
convex lens.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Interesting, though elementary,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>said he (<font color='blue'><b>Holmes</b></font>) as he (<font color='blue'><b>Holmes</b></font>) returned to his (<font color='blue'><b>Holmes</b></font>)
favourite corner of the settee. <div class="bookquote">``There are certainly one or two
indications upon the stick. It gives us the basis for several
deductions.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Has anything escaped me?''  (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div>I asked with some self-importance. <div class="bookquote">``I trust
that there is nothing of consequence which I have overlooked?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I am afraid, my dear Watson, that most of your conclusions were
erroneous. When I said that you stimulated me I meant, to be frank, that
in noting your fallacies I was occasionally guided towards the truth.
Not that you are entirely wrong in this instance. The man is certainly a
country practitioner. And he (<font color='blue'><b>practitioner</b></font>) walks a good deal.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Then I was right.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``To that extent.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``But that was all.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``No, no, my dear Watson, not all--by no means all. I would suggest, for
example, that a presentation to a doctor is more likely to come from a
hospital than from a hunt, and that when the initials `C.C.' are placed
before that hospital the words `Charing Cross' very naturally suggest
themselves.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``You may be right.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``The probability lies in that direction. And if we take this as a
working hypothesis we have a fresh basis from which to start our
construction of this unknown visitor.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Well, then, supposing that `C.C.H.' does stand for `Charing Cross
Hospital,' what further inferences may we draw?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Do none suggest themselves? You know my methods. Apply them!''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I can only think of the obvious conclusion that the man has practised
in town before going to the country.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I think that we might venture a little farther than this. Look at it
in this light. On what occasion would it be most probable that such a
presentation would be made? When would his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) friends unite to give him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>)
a pledge of their good will? Obviously at the moment when Dr. Mortimer
withdrew from the service of the hospital in order to start a practice
for himself. We know there has been a presentation. We believe there has
been a change from a town hospital to a country practice. Is it, then,
stretching our inference too far to say that the presentation was on the
occasion of the change?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``It certainly seems probable.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Now, you will observe that he (<font color='blue'><b>Mortimer</b></font>) could not have been on the staff of the
hospital, since only a man well-established in a London practice could
hold such a position, and such a one would not drift into the country.
What was he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>), then? If he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) was in the hospital and yet not on the staff he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>)
could only have been a house-surgeon or a house-physician--little more
than a senior student. And he (<font color='blue'><b>student</b></font>) left five years ago--the date is on the
stick. So your grave, middle-aged family practitioner vanishes into
thin air, my dear Watson, and there emerges a young fellow under thirty,
amiable, unambitious, absent-minded, and the possessor of a favourite
dog, which I should describe roughly as being larger than a terrier and
smaller than a mastiff.''

 (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div><p/>I laughed incredulously as Sherlock Holmes leaned back in his (<font color='blue'><b>Holmes</b></font>) settee and
blew little wavering rings of smoke up to the ceiling.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``As to the latter part, I have no means of checking you,''  (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div>said I, <div class="bookquote">``but
at least it is not difficult to find out a few particulars about the
man's age and professional career.''  (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div>From my small medical shelf I took
down the Medical Directory and turned up the name. There were several
Mortimers, but only one who could be our visitor. I read his (<font color='blue'><b>visitor</b></font>) record
aloud.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Mortimer, James, M.R.C.S., 1882, Grimpen, Dartmoor, Devon.
House-surgeon, from 1882 to 1884, at Charing Cross Hospital.
Winner of the Jackson prize for Comparative Pathology,
with essay entitled `Is Disease a Reversion?' Corresponding
member of the Swedish Pathological Society. Author of
`Some Freaks of Atavism' -LRB-Lancet 1882-RRB-. `Do We Progress?'
-LRB-Journal of Psychology, March, 1883-RRB-. Medical Officer
for the parishes of Grimpen, Thorsley, and High Barrow.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``No mention of that local hunt, Watson,''  (<font color='red'><b>Holmes/Mr. Holmes/Sherlock Holmes</b></font>)</div>said Holmes with a mischievous
smile, <div class="bookquote">``but a country doctor, as you very astutely observed. I think
that I am fairly justified in my inferences. As to the adjectives, I
said, if I remember right, amiable, unambitious, and absent-minded.
It is my experience that it is only an amiable man in this world who
receives testimonials, only an unambitious one who abandons a London
career for the country, and only an absent-minded one who leaves his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>)
stick and not his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) visiting-card after waiting an hour in your room.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Holmes/Mr. Holmes/Sherlock Holmes</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``And the dog?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Has been in the habit of carrying this stick behind his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) master. Being a
heavy stick the dog has held it tightly by the middle, and the marks of
his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) teeth are very plainly visible. The dog's jaw, as shown in the space
between these marks, is too broad in my opinion for a terrier and not
broad enough for a mastiff. It may have been--yes, by Jove, it is a
curly-haired spaniel.''

 (<font color='red'><b>He</b></font>)</div><p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>visitor</b></font>) had risen and paced the room as he (<font color='blue'><b>visitor</b></font>) spoke. Now he (<font color='blue'><b>visitor</b></font>) halted in the recess
of the window. There was such a ring of conviction in his (<font color='blue'><b>visitor</b></font>) voice that I
glanced up in surprise.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``My dear fellow, how can you possibly be so sure of that?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``For the very simple reason that I see the dog himself on our very
door-step, and there is the ring of its owner. Don't move, I beg you,
Watson. He (<font color='blue'><b>Watson</b></font>) is a professional brother of yours, and your presence may be
of assistance to me. Now is the dramatic moment of fate, Watson, when
you hear a step upon the stair which is walking into your life, and you
know not whether for good or ill. What does Dr. James Mortimer, the man
of science, ask of Sherlock Holmes, the specialist in crime? Come in!''

 (<font color='red'><b>visitor</b></font>)</div><p/>The appearance of our visitor was a surprise to me, since I had expected
a typical country practitioner. He (<font color='blue'><b>practitioner</b></font>) was a very tall, thin man, with a
long nose like a beak, which jutted out between two keen, gray eyes,
set closely together and sparkling brightly from behind a pair of
gold-rimmed glasses. He (<font color='blue'><b>practitioner</b></font>) was clad in a professional but rather slovenly
fashion, for his (<font color='blue'><b>practitioner</b></font>) frock-coat was dingy and his (<font color='blue'><b>practitioner</b></font>) trousers frayed. Though
young, his (<font color='blue'><b>practitioner</b></font>) long back was already bowed, and he (<font color='blue'><b>practitioner</b></font>) walked with a forward
thrust of his (<font color='blue'><b>practitioner</b></font>) head and a general air of peering benevolence. As he (<font color='blue'><b>practitioner</b></font>)
entered his (<font color='blue'><b>practitioner</b></font>) eyes fell upon the stick in Holmes's hand, and he (<font color='blue'><b>practitioner</b></font>) ran
towards it with an exclamation of joy. <div class="bookquote">``I am so very glad,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>said he (<font color='blue'><b>practitioner</b></font>).
<div class="bookquote">``I was not sure whether I had left it here or in the Shipping Office. I
would not lose that stick for the world.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``A presentation, I see,''  (<font color='red'><b>Holmes/Mr. Holmes/Sherlock Holmes</b></font>)</div>said Holmes.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Yes, sir.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``From Charing Cross Hospital?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``From one or two friends there on the occasion of my marriage.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Dear, dear, that's bad!''  (<font color='red'><b>Holmes/Mr. Holmes/Sherlock Holmes</b></font>)</div>said Holmes, shaking his (<font color='blue'><b>Holmes</b></font>) head.

<p/>Dr. Mortimer blinked through his (<font color='blue'><b>Mortimer</b></font>) glasses in mild astonishment. <div class="bookquote">``Why was
it bad?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Only that you have disarranged our little deductions. Your marriage,
you say?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Yes, sir. I married, and so left the hospital, and with it all hopes of
a consulting practice. It was necessary to make a home of my own.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Come, come, we are not so far wrong, after all,''  (<font color='red'><b>Holmes/Mr. Holmes/Sherlock Holmes</b></font>)</div>said Holmes. <div class="bookquote">``And now,
Dr. James Mortimer--''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Mister, sir, Mister--a humble M.R.C.S.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``And a man of precise mind, evidently.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``A dabbler in science, Mr. Holmes, a picker up of shells on the shores
of the great unknown ocean. I presume that it is Mr. Sherlock Holmes
whom I am addressing and not--''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``No, this is my friend Dr. Watson.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Glad to meet you, sir. I have heard your name mentioned in connection
with that of your friend. You interest me very much, Mr. Holmes. I
had hardly expected so dolichocephalic a skull or such well-marked
supra-orbital development. Would you have any objection to my running my
finger along your parietal fissure? A cast of your skull, sir, until
the original is available, would be an ornament to any anthropological
museum. It is not my intention to be fulsome, but I confess that I covet
your skull.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Holmes/Mr. Holmes/Sherlock Holmes</b></font>)</div><p/>Sherlock Holmes waved our strange visitor into a chair. <div class="bookquote">``You are an
enthusiast in your line of thought, I perceive, sir, as I am in
mine,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>said he (<font color='blue'><b>Holmes</b></font>). <div class="bookquote">``I observe from your forefinger that you make your own
cigarettes. Have no hesitation in lighting one.''

 (<font color='red'><b>The man</b></font>)</div><p/>The man drew out paper and tobacco and twirled the one up in the other
with surprising dexterity. He (<font color='blue'><b>Holmes</b></font>) had long, quivering fingers as agile and
restless as the antennae of an insect.

<p/>Holmes was silent, but his (<font color='blue'><b>Holmes</b></font>) little darting glances showed me the interest
which he (<font color='blue'><b>Holmes</b></font>) took in our curious companion. <div class="bookquote">``I presume, sir,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>said he (<font color='blue'><b>Holmes</b></font>) at
last, <div class="bookquote">``that it was not merely for the purpose of examining my skull that
you have done me the honour to call here last night and again today?''

 (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``No, sir, no; though I am happy to have had the opportunity of doing
that as well. I came to you, Mr. Holmes, because I recognized that I am
myself an unpractical man and because I am suddenly confronted with a
most serious and extraordinary problem. Recognizing, as I do, that you
are the second highest expert in Europe--''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Indeed, sir! May I inquire who has the honour to be the first?''  (<font color='red'><b>Holmes/Mr. Holmes/Sherlock Holmes</b></font>)</div>asked
Holmes with some asperity.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``To the man of precisely scientific mind the work of Monsieur Bertillon
must always appeal strongly.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Then had you not better consult him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>)?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I said, sir, to the precisely scientific mind. But as a practical man
of affairs it is acknowledged that you stand alone. I trust, sir, that I
have not inadvertently--''

 (<font color='red'><b>Holmes/Mr. Holmes/Sherlock Holmes</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Just a little,''  (<font color='red'><b>Holmes/Mr. Holmes/Sherlock Holmes</b></font>)</div>said Holmes. <div class="bookquote">``I think, Dr. Mortimer, you would do
wisely if without more ado you would kindly tell me plainly what the
exact nature of the problem is in which you demand my assistance.''




 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/>Chapter 2. The Curse of the Baskervilles



<p/><div class="bookquote">``I have in my pocket a manuscript,''  (<font color='red'><b>Dr. Mortimer/Mortimer/Dr. James Mortimer</b></font>)</div>said Dr. James Mortimer.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``I observed it as you entered the room,''  (<font color='red'><b>Holmes/Mr. Holmes/Sherlock Holmes</b></font>)</div>said Holmes.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``It is an old manuscript.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Early eighteenth century, unless it is a forgery.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``How can you say that, sir?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``You have presented an inch or two of it to my examination all the time
that you have been talking. It would be a poor expert who could not give
the date of a document within a decade or so. You may possibly have read
my little monograph upon the subject. I put that at 1730.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``The exact date is 1742.''  (<font color='red'><b>Dr. Mortimer/Mortimer/Dr. James Mortimer</b></font>)</div>Dr. Mortimer drew it from his (<font color='blue'><b>Mortimer</b></font>) breast-pocket.
<div class="bookquote">``This family paper was committed to my care by Sir Charles Baskerville,
whose sudden and tragic death some three months ago created so much
excitement in Devonshire. I may say that I was his (<font color='blue'><b>Baskerville</b></font>) personal friend as
well as his (<font color='blue'><b>Baskerville</b></font>) medical attendant. He (<font color='blue'><b>Baskerville</b></font>) was a strong-minded man, sir, shrewd,
practical, and as unimaginative as I am myself. Yet he (<font color='blue'><b>Baskerville</b></font>) took this
document very seriously, and his (<font color='blue'><b>Baskerville</b></font>) mind was prepared for just such an end
as did eventually overtake him (<font color='blue'><b>Baskerville</b></font>).''

 (<font color='red'><b>Holmes/Mr. Holmes/Sherlock Holmes</b></font>)</div><p/>Holmes stretched out his (<font color='blue'><b>Holmes</b></font>) hand for the manuscript and flattened it upon
his (<font color='blue'><b>Holmes</b></font>) knee. <div class="bookquote">``You will observe, Watson, the alternative use of the long s
and the short. It is one of several indications which enabled me to fix
the date.''

 (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div><p/>I looked over his (<font color='blue'><b>Holmes</b></font>) shoulder at the yellow paper and the faded script. At
the head was written: <div class="bookquote">``Baskerville Hall,''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>and below in large, scrawling
figures: <div class="bookquote">``1742.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``It appears to be a statement of some sort.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Yes, it is a statement of a certain legend which runs in the
Baskerville family.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``But I understand that it is something more modern and practical upon
which you wish to consult me?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Most modern. A most practical, pressing matter, which must be decided
within twenty-four hours. But the manuscript is short and is intimately
connected with the affair. With your permission I will read it to you.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Holmes/Mr. Holmes/Sherlock Holmes</b></font>)</div><p/>Holmes leaned back in his (<font color='blue'><b>Holmes</b></font>) chair, placed his (<font color='blue'><b>Holmes</b></font>) finger-tips together, and
closed his (<font color='blue'><b>Holmes</b></font>) eyes, with an air of resignation. Dr. Mortimer turned the
manuscript to the light and read in a high, cracking voice the following
curious, old-world narrative:

<p/>``Of the origin of the Hound of the Baskervilles there
have been many statements, yet as I come in a direct
line from Hugo Baskerville, and as I had the story from
my father, who also had it from his (<font color='blue'><b>Baskerville</b></font>), I have set it down
with all belief that it occurred even as is here set
forth. And I would have you believe, my sons, that the
same Justice which punishes sin may also most graciously
forgive it, and that no ban is so heavy but that by prayer
and repentance it may be removed. Learn then from this
story not to fear the fruits of the past, but rather to
be circumspect in the future, that those foul passions
whereby our family has suffered so grievously may not
again be loosed to our undoing.

<p/>``Know then that in the time of the Great Rebellion -LRB-the
history of which by the learned Lord Clarendon I most
earnestly commend to your attention-RRB- this Manor of
Baskerville was held by Hugo of that name, nor can it be
gainsaid that he (<font color='blue'><b>Hugo</b></font>) was a most wild, profane, and godless
man. This, in truth, his (<font color='blue'><b>Hugo</b></font>) neighbours might have pardoned,
seeing that saints have never flourished in those parts,
but there was in him (<font color='blue'><b>Hugo</b></font>) a certain wanton and cruel humour
which made his (<font color='blue'><b>Hugo</b></font>) name a by-word through the West. It
chanced that this Hugo came to love -LRB-if, indeed, so dark
a passion may be known under so bright a name-RRB- the daughter
of a yeoman who held lands near the Baskerville estate.
But the young maiden, being discreet and of good repute,
would ever avoid him (<font color='blue'><b>yeoman</b></font>), for she (<font color='blue'><b>daughter</b></font>) feared his (<font color='blue'><b>yeoman</b></font>) evil name. So
it came to pass that one Michaelmas this Hugo, with five
or six of his (<font color='blue'><b>Hugo</b></font>) idle and wicked companions, stole down upon
the farm and carried off the maiden, her (<font color='blue'><b>daughter</b></font>) father and
brothers being from home, as he (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) well knew. When they had
brought her (<font color='blue'><b>daughter</b></font>) to the Hall the maiden was placed in an upper
chamber, while Hugo and his (<font color='blue'><b>Hugo</b></font>) friends sat down to a long
carouse, as was their nightly custom. Now, the poor lass
upstairs was like to have her (<font color='blue'><b>lass</b></font>) wits turned at the singing
and shouting and terrible oaths which came up to her (<font color='blue'><b>lass</b></font>) from
below, for they say that the words used by Hugo Baskerville,
when he (<font color='blue'><b>Baskerville</b></font>) was in wine, were such as might blast the man who
said them. At last in the stress of her (<font color='blue'><b>lass</b></font>) fear she (<font color='blue'><b>lass</b></font>) did that
which might have daunted the bravest or most active man,
for by the aid of the growth of ivy which covered -LRB-and
still covers-RRB- the south wall she (<font color='blue'><b>lass</b></font>) came down from under the
eaves, and so homeward across the moor, there being three
leagues betwixt the Hall and her (<font color='blue'><b>lass</b></font>) father's farm.

<p/>``It chanced that some little time later Hugo left his (<font color='blue'><b>Hugo</b></font>)
guests to carry food and drink--with other worse things,
perchance--to his (<font color='blue'><b>Hugo</b></font>) captive, and so found the cage empty
and the bird escaped. Then, as it would seem, he (<font color='blue'><b>Hugo</b></font>) became
as one that hath a devil, for, rushing down the stairs
into the dining-hall, he (<font color='blue'><b>Hugo</b></font>) sprang upon the great table,
flagons and trenchers flying before him (<font color='blue'><b>Hugo</b></font>), and he (<font color='blue'><b>Hugo</b></font>) cried
aloud before all the company that he (<font color='blue'><b>Hugo</b></font>) would that very
night render his (<font color='blue'><b>Hugo</b></font>) body and soul to the Powers of Evil if
he (<font color='blue'><b>Hugo</b></font>) might but overtake the wench. And while the revellers
stood aghast at the fury of the man, one more wicked or,
it may be, more drunken than the rest, cried out that
they should put the hounds upon her (<font color='blue'><b>Hugo</b></font>). Whereat Hugo ran
from the house, crying to his (<font color='blue'><b>Hugo</b></font>) grooms that they should
saddle his (<font color='blue'><b>Hugo</b></font>) mare and unkennel the pack, and giving the
hounds a kerchief of the maid's, he (<font color='blue'><b>Hugo</b></font>) swung them to the
line, and so off full cry in the moonlight over the moor.

<p/>``Now, for some space the revellers stood agape, unable
to understand all that had been done in such haste. But
anon their bemused wits awoke to the nature of the deed
which was like to be done upon the moorlands. Everything
was now in an uproar, some calling for their pistols,
some for their horses, and some for another flask of
wine. But at length some sense came back to their crazed
minds, and the whole of them, thirteen in number, took
horse and started in pursuit. The moon shone clear above
them, and they rode swiftly abreast, taking that course
which the maid must needs have taken if she (<font color='blue'><b>maid</b></font>) were to reach
her (<font color='blue'><b>maid</b></font>) own home.

<p/>``They had gone a mile or two when they passed one of the
night shepherds upon the moorlands, and they cried to
him (<font color='blue'><b>them</b></font>) to know if he (<font color='blue'><b>them</b></font>) had seen the hunt. And the man, as
the story goes, was so crazed with fear that he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) could
scarce speak, but at last he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) said that he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) had indeed seen
the unhappy maiden, with the hounds upon her (<font color='blue'><b>maid</b></font>) track. `But
I have seen more than that,' said he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>), `for Hugo Baskerville
passed me upon his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) black mare, and there ran mute behind
him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) such a hound of hell as God forbid should ever be at
my heels.' So the drunken squires cursed the shepherd
and rode onward. But soon their skins turned cold, for
there came a galloping across the moor, and the black
mare, dabbled with white froth, went past with trailing
bridle and empty saddle. Then the revellers rode close
together, for a great fear was on them, but they still
followed over the moor, though each, had he (<font color='blue'><b>shepherd</b></font>) been alone,
would have been right glad to have turned his (<font color='blue'><b>shepherd</b></font>) horse's
head. Riding slowly in this fashion they came at last
upon the hounds. These, though known for their valour
and their breed, were whimpering in a cluster at the
head of a deep dip or goyal, as we call it, upon the
moor, some slinking away and some, with starting hackles
and staring eyes, gazing down the narrow valley before them.

<p/>``The company had come to a halt, more sober men, as you
may guess, than when they started. The most of them
would by no means advance, but three of them, the boldest,
or it may be the most drunken, rode forward down the goyal.
Now, it opened into a broad space in which stood two of
those great stones, still to be seen there, which were
set by certain forgotten peoples in the days of old.
The moon was shining bright upon the clearing, and there
in the centre lay the unhappy maid where she (<font color='blue'><b>maid</b></font>) had fallen,
dead of fear and of fatigue. But it was not the sight
of her (<font color='blue'><b>maid</b></font>) body, nor yet was it that of the body of Hugo
Baskerville lying near her (<font color='blue'><b>maid</b></font>), which raised the hair upon
the heads of these three dare-devil roysterers, but it
was that, standing over Hugo, and plucking at his (<font color='blue'><b>Hugo</b></font>) throat,
there stood a foul thing, a great, black beast, shaped
like a hound, yet larger than any hound that ever mortal
eye has rested upon. And even as they looked the thing
tore the throat out of Hugo Baskerville, on which, as it
turned its blazing eyes and dripping jaws upon them, the
three shrieked with fear and rode for dear life, still
screaming, across the moor. One, it is said, died that
very night of what he (<font color='blue'><b>Baskerville</b></font>) had seen, and the other twain were
but broken men for the rest of their days.

<p/>``Such is the tale, my sons, of the coming of the hound
which is said to have plagued the family so sorely ever
since. If I have set it down it is because that which
is clearly known hath less terror than that which is but
hinted at and guessed. Nor can it be denied that many
of the family have been unhappy in their deaths, which
have been sudden, bloody, and mysterious. Yet may we
shelter ourselves in the infinite goodness of Providence,
which would not forever punish the innocent beyond that
third or fourth generation which is threatened in Holy
Writ. To that Providence, my sons, I hereby commend
you, and I counsel you by way of caution to forbear from
crossing the moor in those dark hours when the powers of
evil are exalted.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Well?''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>said he (<font color='blue'><b>Holmes</b></font>).

 (<font color='red'><b>Dr. Mortimer/Mortimer/Dr. James Mortimer</b></font>)</div><p/>Dr. Mortimer drew a folded newspaper out of his (<font color='blue'><b>Mortimer</b></font>) pocket.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Now, Mr. Holmes, we will give you something a little more recent. This
is the Devon County Chronicle of May 14th of this year. It is a short
account of the facts elicited at the death of Sir Charles Baskerville
which occurred a few days before that date.''

 (<font color='red'><b>friend</b></font>)</div><p/>My friend leaned a little forward and his (<font color='blue'><b>Mortimer</b></font>) expression became intent. Our
visitor readjusted his (<font color='blue'><b>Mortimer</b></font>) glasses and began:

<p/>``The recent sudden death of Sir Charles Baskerville, whose
name has been mentioned as the probable Liberal candidate
for Mid-Devon at the next election, has cast a gloom over
the county. Though Sir Charles had resided at Baskerville
Hall for a comparatively short period his (<font color='blue'><b>Charles</b></font>) amiability of
character and extreme generosity had won the affection
and respect of all who had been brought into contact with
him (<font color='blue'><b>Charles</b></font>). In these days of nouveaux riches it is refreshing
to find a case where the scion of an old county family
which has fallen upon evil days is able to make his (<font color='blue'><b>Charles</b></font>) own
fortune and to bring it back with him (<font color='blue'><b>Charles</b></font>) to restore the
fallen grandeur of his (<font color='blue'><b>Charles</b></font>) line. Sir Charles, as is well known,
made large sums of money in South African speculation.
More wise than those who go on until the wheel turns
against them, he (<font color='blue'><b>Charles</b></font>) realized his (<font color='blue'><b>Charles</b></font>) gains and returned to England
with them. It is only two years since he (<font color='blue'><b>Charles</b></font>) took up his (<font color='blue'><b>Charles</b></font>)
residence at Baskerville Hall, and it is common talk how
large were those schemes of reconstruction and improvement
which have been interrupted by his (<font color='blue'><b>Charles</b></font>) death. Being himself
childless, it was his (<font color='blue'><b>Charles</b></font>) openly expressed desire that the
whole countryside should, within his (<font color='blue'><b>Charles</b></font>) own lifetime, profit
by his (<font color='blue'><b>Charles</b></font>) good fortune, and many will have personal reasons
for bewailing his (<font color='blue'><b>Charles</b></font>) untimely end. His (<font color='blue'><b>Charles</b></font>) generous donations
to local and county charities have been frequently
chronicled in these columns.

<p/>``The circumstances connected with the death of Sir Charles
cannot be said to have been entirely cleared up by the
inquest, but at least enough has been done to dispose of
those rumours to which local superstition has given rise.
There is no reason whatever to suspect foul play, or to
imagine that death could be from any but natural causes.
Sir Charles was a widower, and a man who may be said to
have been in some ways of an eccentric habit of mind.
In spite of his (<font color='blue'><b>Charles</b></font>) considerable wealth he (<font color='blue'><b>Charles</b></font>) was simple in his (<font color='blue'><b>Charles</b></font>)
personal tastes, and his (<font color='blue'><b>Charles</b></font>) indoor servants at Baskerville
Hall consisted of a married couple named Barrymore, the
husband acting as butler and the wife as housekeeper.
Their evidence, corroborated by that of several friends,
tends to show that Sir Charles's health has for some time
been impaired, and points especially to some affection
of the heart, manifesting itself in changes of colour,
breathlessness, and acute attacks of nervous depression.
Dr. James Mortimer, the friend and medical attendant of
the deceased, has given evidence to the same effect.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``The facts of the case are simple. Sir Charles Baskerville
was in the habit every night before going to bed of walking
down the famous yew alley of Baskerville Hall. The evidence
of the Barrymores shows that this had been his (<font color='blue'><b>Baskerville</b></font>) custom.
On the fourth of May Sir Charles had declared his (<font color='blue'><b>Charles</b></font>) intention
of starting next day for London, and had ordered Barrymore
to prepare his (<font color='blue'><b>Charles</b></font>) luggage. That night he (<font color='blue'><b>Charles</b></font>) went out as usual
for his (<font color='blue'><b>Charles</b></font>) nocturnal walk, in the course of which he (<font color='blue'><b>Charles</b></font>) was in
the habit of smoking a cigar. He (<font color='blue'><b>Charles</b></font>) never returned. At
twelve o’clock Barrymore, finding the hall door still open,
became alarmed, and, lighting a lantern, went in search
of his (<font color='blue'><b>Charles</b></font>) master. The day had been wet, and Sir Charles's
footmarks were easily traced down the alley. Halfway down
this walk there is a gate which leads out on to the moor.
There were indications that Sir Charles had stood for some
little time here. He (<font color='blue'><b>Charles</b></font>) then proceeded down the alley, and
it was at the far end of it that his (<font color='blue'><b>Charles</b></font>) body was discovered.
One fact which has not been explained is the statement
of Barrymore that his (<font color='blue'><b>Charles</b></font>) master's footprints altered their
character from the time that he (<font color='blue'><b>Charles</b></font>) passed the moor-gate, and
that he (<font color='blue'><b>Charles</b></font>) appeared from thence onward to have been walking
upon his (<font color='blue'><b>Charles</b></font>) toes. One Murphy, a gipsy horse-dealer, was on
the moor at no great distance at the time, but he (<font color='blue'><b>Murphy</b></font>) appears
by his (<font color='blue'><b>Murphy</b></font>) own confession to have been the worse for drink.
He (<font color='blue'><b>Murphy</b></font>) declares that he (<font color='blue'><b>Murphy</b></font>) heard cries but is unable to state
from what direction they came. No signs of violence were
to be discovered upon Sir Charles's person, and though
the doctor's evidence pointed to an almost incredible
facial distortion--so great that Dr. Mortimer refused at
first to believe that it was indeed his (<font color='blue'><b>Mortimer</b></font>) friend and patient
who lay before him (<font color='blue'><b>Mortimer</b></font>)--it was explained that that is a symptom
which is not unusual in cases of dyspnoea and death from
cardiac exhaustion. This explanation was borne out by
the post-mortem examination, which showed long-standing
organic disease, and the coroner's jury returned a
verdict in accordance with the medical evidence. It is
well that this is so, for it is obviously of the utmost
importance that Sir Charles's heir should settle at the
Hall and continue the good work which has been so sadly
interrupted. Had the prosaic finding of the coroner not
finally put an end to the romantic stories which have been
whispered in connection with the affair, it might have been
difficult to find a tenant for Baskerville Hall. It is
understood that the next of kin is Mr. Henry Baskerville,
if he (<font color='blue'><b>Henry</b></font>) be still alive, the son of Sir Charles Baskerville's
younger brother. The young man when last heard of was
in America, and inquiries are being instituted with a
view to informing him (<font color='blue'><b>Baskerville</b></font>) of his (<font color='blue'><b>Baskerville</b></font>) good fortune.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Dr. Mortimer/Mortimer/Dr. James Mortimer</b></font>)</div><p/>Dr. Mortimer refolded his (<font color='blue'><b>Mortimer</b></font>) paper and replaced it in his (<font color='blue'><b>Mortimer</b></font>) pocket. <div class="bookquote">``Those
are the public facts, Mr. Holmes, in connection with the death of Sir
Charles Baskerville.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I must thank you,''  (<font color='red'><b>Holmes/Mr. Holmes/Sherlock Holmes</b></font>)</div>said Sherlock Holmes, <div class="bookquote">``for calling my attention to a
case which certainly presents some features of interest. I had observed
some newspaper comment at the time, but I was exceedingly preoccupied
by that little affair of the Vatican cameos, and in my anxiety to oblige
the Pope I lost touch with several interesting English cases. This
article, you say, contains all the public facts?''

 (<font color='red'><b>Holmes/Mr. Holmes/Sherlock Holmes</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``It does.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Then let me have the private ones.''  (<font color='red'><b>He</b></font>)</div>He (<font color='blue'><b>Holmes</b></font>) leaned back, put his (<font color='blue'><b>Holmes</b></font>) finger-tips
together, and assumed his (<font color='blue'><b>Holmes</b></font>) most impassive and judicial expression.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``In doing so,''  (<font color='red'><b>Dr. Mortimer/Mortimer/Dr. James Mortimer</b></font>)</div>said Dr. Mortimer, who had begun to show signs of some
strong emotion, ``I am telling that which I have not confided to anyone.
My motive for withholding it from the coroner's inquiry is that a man of
science shrinks from placing himself in the public position of seeming
to indorse a popular superstition. I had the further motive that
Baskerville Hall, as the paper says, would certainly remain untenanted
if anything were done to increase its already rather grim reputation.
For both these reasons I thought that I was justified in telling rather
less than I knew, since no practical good could result from it, but with
you there is no reason why I should not be perfectly frank.

<p/>``The moor is very sparsely inhabited, and those who live near each other
are thrown very much together. For this reason I saw a good deal of
Sir Charles Baskerville. With the exception of Mr. Frankland, of Lafter
Hall, and Mr. Stapleton, the naturalist, there are no other men of
education within many miles. Sir Charles was a retiring man, but the
chance of his (<font color='blue'><b>Charles</b></font>) illness brought us together, and a community of interests
in science kept us so. He (<font color='blue'><b>Charles</b></font>) had brought back much scientific information
from South Africa, and many a charming evening we have spent together
discussing the comparative anatomy of the Bushman and the Hottentot.

<p/>``Within the last few months it became increasingly plain to me that
Sir Charles's nervous system was strained to the breaking point. He (<font color='blue'><b>Charles</b></font>) had
taken this legend which I have read you exceedingly to heart--so much
so that, although he (<font color='blue'><b>Charles</b></font>) would walk in his (<font color='blue'><b>Charles</b></font>) own grounds, nothing would induce
him (<font color='blue'><b>Charles</b></font>) to go out upon the moor at night. Incredible as it may appear to
you, Mr. Holmes, he (<font color='blue'><b>Holmes</b></font>) was honestly convinced that a dreadful fate overhung
his (<font color='blue'><b>Holmes</b></font>) family, and certainly the records which he (<font color='blue'><b>Holmes</b></font>) was able to give of
his (<font color='blue'><b>Holmes</b></font>) ancestors were not encouraging. The idea of some ghastly presence
constantly haunted him (<font color='blue'><b>Holmes</b></font>), and on more than one occasion he (<font color='blue'><b>Holmes</b></font>) has asked me
whether I had on my medical journeys at night ever seen any strange
creature or heard the baying of a hound. The latter question he (<font color='blue'><b>Holmes</b></font>) put
to me several times, and always with a voice which vibrated with
excitement.

<p/>``I can well remember driving up to his (<font color='blue'><b>Holmes</b></font>) house in the evening some three
weeks before the fatal event. He (<font color='blue'><b>Holmes</b></font>) chanced to be at his (<font color='blue'><b>Holmes</b></font>) hall door. I had
descended from my gig and was standing in front of him (<font color='blue'><b>Holmes</b></font>), when I saw
his (<font color='blue'><b>Holmes</b></font>) eyes fix themselves over my shoulder and stare past me with an
expression of the most dreadful horror. I whisked round and had just
time to catch a glimpse of something which I took to be a large black
calf passing at the head of the drive. So excited and alarmed was he (<font color='blue'><b>Holmes</b></font>)
that I was compelled to go down to the spot where the animal had been
and look around for it. It was gone, however, and the incident appeared
to make the worst impression upon his (<font color='blue'><b>Holmes</b></font>) mind. I stayed with him (<font color='blue'><b>Holmes</b></font>) all the
evening, and it was on that occasion, to explain the emotion which he (<font color='blue'><b>Holmes</b></font>)
had shown, that he (<font color='blue'><b>Holmes</b></font>) confided to my keeping that narrative which I read to
you when first I came. I mention this small episode because it assumes
some importance in view of the tragedy which followed, but I was
convinced at the time that the matter was entirely trivial and that his (<font color='blue'><b>Holmes</b></font>)
excitement had no justification.

<p/>``It was at my advice that Sir Charles was about to go to London. His (<font color='blue'><b>Charles</b></font>)
heart was, I knew, affected, and the constant anxiety in which he (<font color='blue'><b>Charles</b></font>) lived,
however chimerical the cause of it might be, was evidently having a
serious effect upon his (<font color='blue'><b>Charles</b></font>) health. I thought that a few months among the
distractions of town would send him (<font color='blue'><b>Charles</b></font>) back a new man. Mr. Stapleton, a
mutual friend who was much concerned at his (<font color='blue'><b>Stapleton</b></font>) state of health, was of the
same opinion. At the last instant came this terrible catastrophe.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``On the night of Sir Charles's death Barrymore the butler, who made
the discovery, sent Perkins the groom on horseback to me, and as I was
sitting up late I was able to reach Baskerville Hall within an hour of
the event. I checked and corroborated all the facts which were mentioned
at the inquest. I followed the footsteps down the yew alley, I saw the
spot at the moor-gate where he (<font color='blue'><b>Perkins</b></font>) seemed to have waited, I remarked the
change in the shape of the prints after that point, I noted that there
were no other footsteps save those of Barrymore on the soft gravel, and
finally I carefully examined the body, which had not been touched until
my arrival. Sir Charles lay on his (<font color='blue'><b>Charles</b></font>) face, his (<font color='blue'><b>Charles</b></font>) arms out, his (<font color='blue'><b>Charles</b></font>) fingers dug
into the ground, and his (<font color='blue'><b>Charles</b></font>) features convulsed with some strong emotion to
such an extent that I could hardly have sworn to his (<font color='blue'><b>Charles</b></font>) identity. There was
certainly no physical injury of any kind. But one false statement was
made by Barrymore at the inquest. He (<font color='blue'><b>Charles</b></font>) said that there were no traces
upon the ground round the body. He (<font color='blue'><b>Charles</b></font>) did not observe any. But I did--some
little distance off, but fresh and clear.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Footprints.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Dr. Mortimer/Mortimer/Dr. James Mortimer</b></font>)</div><p/>Dr. Mortimer looked strangely at us for an instant, and his (<font color='blue'><b>Mortimer</b></font>) voice sank
almost to a whisper as he (<font color='blue'><b>Mortimer</b></font>) answered.

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/>Chapter 3. The Problem



<p/>I confess at these words a shudder passed through me. There was a thrill
in the doctor's voice which showed that he (<font color='blue'><b>doctor</b></font>) was himself deeply moved by
that which he (<font color='blue'><b>doctor</b></font>) told us. Holmes leaned forward in his (<font color='blue'><b>Holmes</b></font>) excitement and his (<font color='blue'><b>Holmes</b></font>)

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``It was all very confused. Sir Charles had evidently stood there for
five or ten minutes.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``How do you know that?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Because the ash had twice dropped from his (<font color='blue'><b>Charles</b></font>) cigar.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Excellent! This is a colleague, Watson, after our own heart. But the
marks?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``He (<font color='blue'><b>Watson</b></font>) had left his (<font color='blue'><b>Watson</b></font>) own marks all over that small patch of gravel. I could
discern no others.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Holmes/Mr. Holmes/Sherlock Holmes</b></font>)</div><p/>Sherlock Holmes struck his (<font color='blue'><b>Holmes</b></font>) hand against his (<font color='blue'><b>Holmes</b></font>) knee with an impatient
gesture.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``If I had only been there!''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Holmes</b></font>) cried. <div class="bookquote">``It is evidently a case of
extraordinary interest, and one which presented immense opportunities to
the scientific expert. That gravel page upon which I might have read so
much has been long ere this smudged by the rain and defaced by the clogs
of curious peasants. Oh, Dr. Mortimer, Dr. Mortimer, to think that you
should not have called me in! You have indeed much to answer for.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I could not call you in, Mr. Holmes, without disclosing these facts to
the world, and I have already given my reasons for not wishing to do so.
Besides, besides--''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Why do you hesitate?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``There is a realm in which the most acute and most experienced of
detectives is helpless.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``You mean that the thing is supernatural?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I did not positively say so.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``No, but you evidently think it.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Since the tragedy, Mr. Holmes, there have come to my ears several
incidents which are hard to reconcile with the settled order of Nature.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``For example?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I find that before the terrible event occurred several people had seen
a creature upon the moor which corresponds with this Baskerville demon,
and which could not possibly be any animal known to science. They all
agreed that it was a huge creature, luminous, ghastly, and spectral. I
have cross-examined these men, one of them a hard-headed countryman,
one a farrier, and one a moorland farmer, who all tell the same story of
this dreadful apparition, exactly corresponding to the hell-hound of the
legend. I assure you that there is a reign of terror in the district,
and that it is a hardy man who will cross the moor at night.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``And you, a trained man of science, believe it to be supernatural?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I do not know what to believe.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Holmes/Mr. Holmes/Sherlock Holmes</b></font>)</div><p/>Holmes shrugged his (<font color='blue'><b>Holmes</b></font>) shoulders. <div class="bookquote">``I have hitherto confined my
investigations to this world,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>said he (<font color='blue'><b>Holmes</b></font>). <div class="bookquote">``In a modest way I have combated
evil, but to take on the Father of Evil himself would, perhaps, be too
ambitious a task. Yet you must admit that the footmark is material.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``The original hound was material enough to tug a man's throat out, and
yet he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) was diabolical as well.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I see that you have quite gone over to the supernaturalists. But now,
Dr. Mortimer, tell me this. If you hold these views, why have you come
to consult me at all? You tell me in the same breath that it is useless
to investigate Sir Charles's death, and that you desire me to do it.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I did not say that I desired you to do it.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Then, how can I assist you?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``By advising me as to what I should do with Sir Henry Baskerville, who
arrives at Waterloo Station'' (<font color='red'><b>Dr. Mortimer/Mortimer/Dr. James Mortimer</b></font>)</div>--Dr. Mortimer looked at his (<font color='blue'><b>Mortimer</b></font>) watch--<div class="bookquote">``in
exactly one hour and a quarter.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Dr. Mortimer/Mortimer/Dr. James Mortimer</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``He (<font color='blue'><b>Baskerville</b></font>) being the heir?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Yes. On the death of Sir Charles we inquired for this young gentleman
and found that he (<font color='blue'><b>Charles</b></font>) had been farming in Canada. From the accounts which
have reached us he (<font color='blue'><b>Charles</b></font>) is an excellent fellow in every way. I speak now not
as a medical man but as a trustee and executor of Sir Charles's will.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``There is no other claimant, I presume?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``None. The only other kinsman whom we have been able to trace was Rodger
Baskerville, the youngest of three brothers of whom poor Sir Charles was
the elder. The second brother, who died young, is the father of this lad
Henry. The third, Rodger, was the black sheep of the family. He (<font color='blue'><b>Rodger</b></font>) came of
the old masterful Baskerville strain and was the very image, they tell
me, of the family picture of old Hugo. He (<font color='blue'><b>Hugo</b></font>) made England too hot to hold
him (<font color='blue'><b>Hugo</b></font>), fled to Central America, and died there in 1876 of yellow fever.
Henry is the last of the Baskervilles. In one hour and five minutes
I meet him (<font color='blue'><b>Henry</b></font>) at Waterloo Station. I have had a wire that he (<font color='blue'><b>Henry</b></font>) arrived at
Southampton this morning. Now, Mr. Holmes, what would you advise me to
do with him (<font color='blue'><b>Holmes</b></font>)?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Why should he (<font color='blue'><b>Holmes</b></font>) not go to the home of his (<font color='blue'><b>Holmes</b></font>) fathers?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``It seems natural, does it not? And yet, consider that every Baskerville
who goes there meets with an evil fate. I feel sure that if Sir Charles
could have spoken with me before his (<font color='blue'><b>Charles</b></font>) death he (<font color='blue'><b>Charles</b></font>) would have warned me
against bringing this, the last of the old race, and the heir to great
wealth, to that deadly place. And yet it cannot be denied that the
prosperity of the whole poor, bleak countryside depends upon his (<font color='blue'><b>heir</b></font>)
presence. All the good work which has been done by Sir Charles will
crash to the ground if there is no tenant of the Hall. I fear lest I
should be swayed too much by my own obvious interest in the matter, and
that is why I bring the case before you and ask for your advice.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Holmes/Mr. Holmes/Sherlock Holmes</b></font>)</div><p/>Holmes considered for a little time.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Put into plain words, the matter is this,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>said he (<font color='blue'><b>Mortimer</b></font>). <div class="bookquote">``In your opinion
there is a diabolical agency which makes Dartmoor an unsafe abode for a
Baskerville--that is your opinion?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``At least I might go the length of saying that there is some evidence
that this may be so.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Exactly. But surely, if your supernatural theory be correct, it could
work the young man evil in London as easily as in Devonshire. A devil
with merely local powers like a parish vestry would be too inconceivable
a thing.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``You put the matter more flippantly, Mr. Holmes, than you would probably
do if you were brought into personal contact with these things. Your
advice, then, as I understand it, is that the young man will be as safe
in Devonshire as in London. He (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) comes in fifty minutes. What would you
recommend?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I recommend, sir, that you take a cab, call off your spaniel who is
scratching at my front door, and proceed to Waterloo to meet Sir Henry
Baskerville.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``And then?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``And then you will say nothing to him (<font color='blue'><b>Baskerville</b></font>) at all until I have made up my
mind about the matter.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``How long will it take you to make up your mind?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Twenty-four hours. At ten o’clock tomorrow, Dr. Mortimer, I will be
much obliged to you if you will call upon me here, and it will be
of help to me in my plans for the future if you will bring Sir Henry
Baskerville with you.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I will do so, Mr. Holmes.''  (<font color='red'><b>He</b></font>)</div>He (<font color='blue'><b>Mortimer</b></font>) scribbled the appointment on his (<font color='blue'><b>Mortimer</b></font>)
shirt-cuff and hurried off in his (<font color='blue'><b>Mortimer</b></font>) strange, peering, absent-minded
fashion. Holmes stopped him (<font color='blue'><b>Holmes</b></font>) at the head of the stair.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Only one more question, Dr. Mortimer. You say that before Sir Charles
Baskerville's death several people saw this apparition upon the moor?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Three people did.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Did any see it after?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I have not heard of any.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Thank you. Good-morning.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Holmes/Mr. Holmes/Sherlock Holmes</b></font>)</div><p/>Holmes returned to his (<font color='blue'><b>Holmes</b></font>) seat with that quiet look of inward satisfaction
which meant that he (<font color='blue'><b>Holmes</b></font>) had a congenial task before him (<font color='blue'><b>Holmes</b></font>).

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Going out, Watson?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Unless I can help you.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``No, my dear fellow, it is at the hour of action that I turn to you for
aid. But this is splendid, really unique from some points of view.
When you pass Bradley's, would you ask him (<font color='blue'><b>Bradley</b></font>) to send up a pound of the
strongest shag tobacco? Thank you. It would be as well if you could make
it convenient not to return before evening. Then I should be very glad
to compare impressions as to this most interesting problem which has
been submitted to us this morning.''

 (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div><p/>I knew that seclusion and solitude were very necessary for my friend
in those hours of intense mental concentration during which he (<font color='blue'><b>friend</b></font>) weighed
every particle of evidence, constructed alternative theories, balanced
one against the other, and made up his (<font color='blue'><b>friend</b></font>) mind as to which points were
essential and which immaterial. I therefore spent the day at my club and
did not return to Baker Street until evening. It was nearly nine o’clock
when I found myself in the sitting-room once more.

<p/>My first impression as I opened the door was that a fire had broken out,
for the room was so filled with smoke that the light of the lamp upon
the table was blurred by it. As I entered, however, my fears were set at
rest, for it was the acrid fumes of strong coarse tobacco which took me
by the throat and set me coughing. Through the haze I had a vague vision
of Holmes in his (<font color='blue'><b>Holmes</b></font>) dressing-gown coiled up in an armchair with his (<font color='blue'><b>Holmes</b></font>) black
clay pipe between his (<font color='blue'><b>Holmes</b></font>) lips. Several rolls of paper lay around him (<font color='blue'><b>Holmes</b></font>).

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Caught cold, Watson?''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>said he (<font color='blue'><b>Holmes</b></font>).

<p/><div class="bookquote">``No, it's this poisonous atmosphere.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I suppose it is pretty thick, now that you mention it.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Thick! It is intolerable.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Open the window, then! You have been at your club all day, I perceive.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``My dear Holmes!''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Am I right?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Certainly, but how?''

 (<font color='red'><b>He</b></font>)</div><p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Holmes</b></font>) laughed at my bewildered expression. <div class="bookquote">``There is a delightful freshness
about you, Watson, which makes it a pleasure to exercise any small
powers which I possess at your expense. A gentleman goes forth on a
showery and miry day. He (<font color='blue'><b>gentleman</b></font>) returns immaculate in the evening with the
gloss still on his (<font color='blue'><b>gentleman</b></font>) hat and his (<font color='blue'><b>gentleman</b></font>) boots. He (<font color='blue'><b>gentleman</b></font>) has been a fixture therefore
all day. He (<font color='blue'><b>gentleman</b></font>) is not a man with intimate friends. Where, then, could he (<font color='blue'><b>gentleman</b></font>)
have been? Is it not obvious?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Well, it is rather obvious.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``The world is full of obvious things which nobody by any chance ever
observes. Where do you think that I have been?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``A fixture also.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``On the contrary, I have been to Devonshire.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``In spirit?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Exactly. My body has remained in this armchair and has, I regret
to observe, consumed in my absence two large pots of coffee and an
incredible amount of tobacco. After you left I sent down to Stamford's
for the Ordnance map of this portion of the moor, and my spirit has
hovered over it all day. I flatter myself that I could find my way
about.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``A large-scale map, I presume?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Very large.''

 (<font color='red'><b>He</b></font>)</div><p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Holmes</b></font>) unrolled one section and held it over his (<font color='blue'><b>Holmes</b></font>) knee. <div class="bookquote">``Here you have the
particular district which concerns us. That is Baskerville Hall in the
middle.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``With a wood round it?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Exactly. I fancy the yew alley, though not marked under that name, must
stretch along this line, with the moor, as you perceive, upon the right
of it. This small clump of buildings here is the hamlet of Grimpen,
where our friend Dr. Mortimer has his (<font color='blue'><b>Mortimer</b></font>) headquarters. Within a radius of
five miles there are, as you see, only a very few scattered dwellings.
Here is Lafter Hall, which was mentioned in the narrative. There is
a house indicated here which may be the residence of the
naturalist--Stapleton, if I remember right, was his (<font color='blue'><b>Stapleton</b></font>) name. Here are two
moorland farmhouses, High Tor and Foulmire. Then fourteen miles away the
great convict prison of Princetown. Between and around these scattered
points extends the desolate, lifeless moor. This, then, is the stage
upon which tragedy has been played, and upon which we may help to play
it again.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``It must be a wild place.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Yes, the setting is a worthy one. If the devil did desire to have a
hand in the affairs of men--''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Then you are yourself inclining to the supernatural explanation.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``The devil's agents may be of flesh and blood, may they not? There are
two questions waiting for us at the outset. The one is whether any crime
has been committed at all; the second is, what is the crime and how was
it committed? Of course, if Dr. Mortimer's surmise should be correct,
and we are dealing with forces outside the ordinary laws of Nature,
there is an end of our investigation. But we are bound to exhaust all
other hypotheses before falling back upon this one. I think we'll shut
that window again, if you don't mind. It is a singular thing, but I find
that a concentrated atmosphere helps a concentration of thought. I have
not pushed it to the length of getting into a box to think, but that is
the logical outcome of my convictions. Have you turned the case over in
your mind?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Yes, I have thought a good deal of it in the course of the day.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``What do you make of it?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``It is very bewildering.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``It has certainly a character of its own. There are points of
distinction about it. That change in the footprints, for example. What
do you make of that?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Mortimer said that the man had walked on tiptoe down that portion of
the alley.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``He (<font color='blue'><b>Mortimer</b></font>) only repeated what some fool had said at the inquest. Why should a
man walk on tiptoe down the alley?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``What then?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``He (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) was running, Watson--running desperately, running for his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) life,
running until he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) burst his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) heart--and fell dead upon his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) face.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Running from what?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``There lies our problem. There are indications that the man was crazed
with fear before ever he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) began to run.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``How can you say that?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I am presuming that the cause of his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) fears came to him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) across the moor.
If that were so, and it seems most probable, only a man who had lost his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>)
wits would have run from the house instead of towards it. If the
gipsy's evidence may be taken as true, he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) ran with cries for help in the
direction where help was least likely to be. Then, again, whom was he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>)
waiting for that night, and why was he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) waiting for him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) in the yew alley
rather than in his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) own house?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``You think that he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) was waiting for someone?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``The man was elderly and infirm. We can understand his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) taking an evening
stroll, but the ground was damp and the night inclement. Is it natural
that he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) should stand for five or ten minutes, as Dr. Mortimer, with more
practical sense than I should have given him (<font color='blue'><b>Mortimer</b></font>) credit for, deduced from
the cigar ash?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``But he (<font color='blue'><b>Mortimer</b></font>) went out every evening.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I think it unlikely that he (<font color='blue'><b>Mortimer</b></font>) waited at the moor-gate every evening. On
the contrary, the evidence is that he (<font color='blue'><b>Mortimer</b></font>) avoided the moor. That night he (<font color='blue'><b>Mortimer</b></font>)
waited there. It was the night before he (<font color='blue'><b>Mortimer</b></font>) made his (<font color='blue'><b>Mortimer</b></font>) departure for London.
The thing takes shape, Watson. It becomes coherent. Might I ask you to
hand me my violin, and we will postpone all further thought upon this
business until we have had the advantage of meeting Dr. Mortimer and Sir
Henry Baskerville in the morning.''




 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/>Chapter 4. Sir Henry Baskerville



<p/>Our breakfast table was cleared early, and Holmes waited in his (<font color='blue'><b>Holmes</b></font>)
dressing-gown for the promised interview. Our clients were punctual to
their appointment, for the clock had just struck ten when Dr. Mortimer
was shown up, followed by the young baronet. The latter was a small,
alert, dark-eyed man about thirty years of age, very sturdily built,
with thick black eyebrows and a strong, pugnacious face. He (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) wore a
ruddy-tinted tweed suit and had the weather-beaten appearance of one who
has spent most of his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) time in the open air, and yet there was something
in his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) steady eye and the quiet assurance of his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) bearing which indicated
the gentleman.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``This is Sir Henry Baskerville,''  (<font color='red'><b>Dr. Mortimer/Mortimer/Dr. James Mortimer</b></font>)</div>said Dr. Mortimer.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Why, yes,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>said he (<font color='blue'><b>Mortimer</b></font>), <div class="bookquote">``and the strange thing is, Mr. Sherlock Holmes,
that if my friend here had not proposed coming round to you this morning
I should have come on my own account. I understand that you think out
little puzzles, and I've had one this morning which wants more thinking
out than I am able to give it.''

 (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Pray take a seat, Sir Henry. Do I understand you to say that you have
yourself had some remarkable experience since you arrived in London?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Nothing of much importance, Mr. Holmes. Only a joke, as like as not.
It was this letter, if you can call it a letter, which reached me this
morning.''

 (<font color='red'><b>He</b></font>)</div><p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Mortimer</b></font>) laid an envelope upon the table, and we all bent over it. It was of
common quality, grayish in colour. The address, <div class="bookquote">``Sir Henry Baskerville,
Northumberland Hotel,''  (<font color='red'><b>characters</b></font>)</div>was printed in rough characters; the post-mark
<div class="bookquote">``Charing Cross,''  (<font color='red'><b>characters</b></font>)</div>and the date of posting the preceding evening.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Who knew that you were going to the Northumberland Hotel?''  (<font color='red'><b>Holmes/Mr. Holmes/Sherlock Holmes</b></font>)</div>asked
Holmes, glancing keenly across at our visitor.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``No one could have known. We only decided after I met Dr. Mortimer.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``But Dr. Mortimer was no doubt already stopping there?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``No, I had been staying with a friend,''  (<font color='red'><b>the doctor</b></font>)</div>said the doctor.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``There was no possible indication that we intended to go to this hotel.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Hum! Someone seems to be very deeply interested in your movements.''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>Out
of the envelope he (<font color='blue'><b>doctor</b></font>) took a half-sheet of foolscap paper folded into four.
This he (<font color='blue'><b>doctor</b></font>) opened and spread flat upon the table. Across the middle of it
a single sentence had been formed by the expedient of pasting printed
words upon it. It ran:

<p/>As you value your life or your reason keep away from the moor.

<p/>The word <div class="bookquote">``moor''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>only was printed in ink.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Now,''  (<font color='red'><b>Henry/Henry Baskerville/Baskerville</b></font>)</div>said Sir Henry Baskerville, <div class="bookquote">``perhaps you will tell me, Mr.
Holmes, what in thunder is the meaning of that, and who it is that takes
so much interest in my affairs?''

 (<font color='red'><b>Henry/Henry Baskerville/Baskerville</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``What do you make of it, Dr. Mortimer? You must allow that there is
nothing supernatural about this, at any rate?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``No, sir, but it might very well come from someone who was convinced
that the business is supernatural.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``What business?''  (<font color='red'><b>Henry/Henry Baskerville/Baskerville</b></font>)</div>asked Sir Henry sharply. <div class="bookquote">``It seems to me that all you
gentlemen know a great deal more than I do about my own affairs.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``You shall share our knowledge before you leave this room, Sir Henry. I
promise you that,''  (<font color='red'><b>Holmes/Mr. Holmes/Sherlock Holmes</b></font>)</div>said Sherlock Holmes. <div class="bookquote">``We will confine ourselves
for the present with your permission to this very interesting document,
which must have been put together and posted yesterday evening. Have you
yesterday's Times, Watson?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``It is here in the corner.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Might I trouble you for it--the inside page, please, with the leading
articles?''  (<font color='red'><b>He</b></font>)</div>He (<font color='blue'><b>Holmes</b></font>) glanced swiftly over it, running his (<font color='blue'><b>Holmes</b></font>) eyes up and down the
columns. ``Capital article this on free trade. Permit me to give you an
extract from it.

<p/>`You may be cajoled into imagining that your own special
trade or your own industry will be encouraged by a
protective tariff, but it stands to reason that such
legislation must in the long run keep away wealth from the
country, diminish the value of our imports, and lower the
general conditions of life in this island.'

<p/><div class="bookquote">``What do you think of that, Watson?''  (<font color='red'><b>Holmes/Mr. Holmes/Sherlock Holmes</b></font>)</div>cried Holmes in high glee, rubbing
his (<font color='blue'><b>Holmes</b></font>) hands together with satisfaction. <div class="bookquote">``Don't you think that is an
admirable sentiment?''

 (<font color='red'><b>Dr. Mortimer/Mortimer/Dr. James Mortimer</b></font>)</div><p/>Dr. Mortimer looked at Holmes with an air of professional interest, and
Sir Henry Baskerville turned a pair of puzzled dark eyes upon me.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``I don't know much about the tariff and things of that kind,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>said he (<font color='blue'><b>Baskerville</b></font>),
<div class="bookquote">``but it seems to me we've got a bit off the trail so far as that note is
concerned.''

 (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``On the contrary, I think we are particularly hot upon the trail, Sir
Henry. Watson here knows more about my methods than you do, but I fear
that even he (<font color='blue'><b>Watson</b></font>) has not quite grasped the significance of this sentence.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``No, I confess that I see no connection.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``And yet, my dear Watson, there is so very close a connection that
the one is extracted out of the other. `You,' `your,' `your,' `life,'
`reason,' `value,' `keep away,' `from the.' Don't you see now whence
these words have been taken?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``By thunder, you're right! Well, if that isn't smart!''  (<font color='red'><b>Henry/Henry Baskerville/Baskerville</b></font>)</div>cried Sir Henry.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``If any possible doubt remained it is settled by the fact that `keep
away' and `from the' are cut out in one piece.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Well, now--so it is!''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Really, Mr. Holmes, this exceeds anything which I could have imagined,''
 (<font color='red'><b>Dr. Mortimer/Mortimer/Dr. James Mortimer</b></font>)</div>said Dr. Mortimer, gazing at my friend in amazement. <div class="bookquote">``I could understand
anyone saying that the words were from a newspaper; but that you should
name which, and add that it came from the leading article, is really one
of the most remarkable things which I have ever known. How did you do
it?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I presume, Doctor, that you could tell the skull of a negro from that
of an Esquimau?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Most certainly.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``But how?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Because that is my special hobby. The differences are obvious. The
supra-orbital crest, the facial angle, the maxillary curve, the--''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``But this is my special hobby, and the differences are equally obvious.
There is as much difference to my eyes between the leaded bourgeois type
of a Times article and the slovenly print of an evening half-penny paper
as there could be between your negro and your Esquimau. The detection of
types is one of the most elementary branches of knowledge to the special
expert in crime, though I confess that once when I was very young I
confused the Leeds Mercury with the Western Morning News. But a Times
leader is entirely distinctive, and these words could have been taken
from nothing else. As it was done yesterday the strong probability was
that we should find the words in yesterday's issue.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``So far as I can follow you, then, Mr. Holmes,''  (<font color='red'><b>Henry/Henry Baskerville/Baskerville</b></font>)</div>said Sir Henry
Baskerville, <div class="bookquote">``someone cut out this message with a scissors--''

 (<font color='red'><b>Henry/Henry Baskerville/Baskerville</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Nail-scissors,''  (<font color='red'><b>Henry/Henry Baskerville/Baskerville</b></font>)</div>said Holmes. ``You can see that it was a very
short-bladed scissors, since the cutter had to take two snips over `keep
away.'''

<p/><div class="bookquote">``That is so. Someone, then, cut out the message with a pair of
short-bladed scissors, pasted it with paste--''

 (<font color='red'><b>Holmes/Mr. Holmes/Sherlock Holmes</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Gum,''  (<font color='red'><b>Holmes/Mr. Holmes/Sherlock Holmes</b></font>)</div>said Holmes.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``With gum on to the paper. But I want to know why the word `moor' should
have been written?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Because he (<font color='blue'><b>Holmes</b></font>) could not find it in print. The other words were all simple
and might be found in any issue, but `moor' would be less common.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Why, of course, that would explain it. Have you read anything else in
this message, Mr. Holmes?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``There are one or two indications, and yet the utmost pains have been
taken to remove all clues. The address, you observe is printed in rough
characters. But the Times is a paper which is seldom found in any hands
but those of the highly educated. We may take it, therefore, that
the letter was composed by an educated man who wished to pose as an
uneducated one, and his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) effort to conceal his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) own writing suggests that
that writing might be known, or come to be known, by you. Again, you
will observe that the words are not gummed on in an accurate line, but
that some are much higher than others. `Life,' for example is quite out
of its proper place. That may point to carelessness or it may point to
agitation and hurry upon the part of the cutter. On the whole I incline
to the latter view, since the matter was evidently important, and it
is unlikely that the composer of such a letter would be careless. If he (<font color='blue'><b>composer</b></font>)
were in a hurry it opens up the interesting question why he (<font color='blue'><b>composer</b></font>) should be
in a hurry, since any letter posted up to early morning would reach
Sir Henry before he (<font color='blue'><b>Henry</b></font>) would leave his (<font color='blue'><b>Henry</b></font>) hotel. Did the composer fear an
interruption--and from whom?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``We are coming now rather into the region of guesswork,''  (<font color='red'><b>Dr. Mortimer/Mortimer/Dr. James Mortimer</b></font>)</div>said Dr.
Mortimer.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Say, rather, into the region where we balance probabilities and choose
the most likely. It is the scientific use of the imagination, but we
have always some material basis on which to start our speculation. Now,
you would call it a guess, no doubt, but I am almost certain that this
address has been written in a hotel.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``How in the world can you say that?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``If you examine it carefully you will see that both the pen and the ink
have given the writer trouble. The pen has spluttered twice in a single
word and has run dry three times in a short address, showing that there
was very little ink in the bottle. Now, a private pen or ink-bottle is
seldom allowed to be in such a state, and the combination of the two
must be quite rare. But you know the hotel ink and the hotel pen, where
it is rare to get anything else. Yes, I have very little hesitation
in saying that could we examine the waste-paper baskets of the hotels
around Charing Cross until we found the remains of the mutilated Times
leader we could lay our hands straight upon the person who sent this
singular message. Halloa! Halloa! What's this?''

 (<font color='red'><b>He</b></font>)</div><p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Holmes</b></font>) was carefully examining the foolscap, upon which the words were
pasted, holding it only an inch or two from his (<font color='blue'><b>Holmes</b></font>) eyes.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Well?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Nothing,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>said he (<font color='blue'><b>Holmes</b></font>), throwing it down. <div class="bookquote">``It is a blank half-sheet of
paper, without even a water-mark upon it. I think we have drawn as much
as we can from this curious letter; and now, Sir Henry, has anything
else of interest happened to you since you have been in London?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Why, no, Mr. Holmes. I think not.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``You have not observed anyone follow or watch you?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I seem to have walked right into the thick of a dime novel,''  (<font color='red'><b>visitor</b></font>)</div>said our
visitor. <div class="bookquote">``Why in thunder should anyone follow or watch me?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``We are coming to that. You have nothing else to report to us before we
go into this matter?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Well, it depends upon what you think worth reporting.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I think anything out of the ordinary routine of life well worth
reporting.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Henry/Henry Baskerville/Baskerville</b></font>)</div><p/>Sir Henry smiled. <div class="bookquote">``I don't know much of British life yet, for I have
spent nearly all my time in the States and in Canada. But I hope that to
lose one of your boots is not part of the ordinary routine of life over
here.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``You have lost one of your boots?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``My dear sir,''  (<font color='red'><b>Dr. Mortimer/Mortimer/Dr. James Mortimer</b></font>)</div>cried Dr. Mortimer, <div class="bookquote">``it is only mislaid. You will find
it when you return to the hotel. What is the use of troubling Mr. Holmes
with trifles of this kind?''

 (<font color='red'><b>Dr. Mortimer/Mortimer/Dr. James Mortimer</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Well, he (<font color='blue'><b>Holmes</b></font>) asked me for anything outside the ordinary routine.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Exactly,''  (<font color='red'><b>Holmes/Mr. Holmes/Sherlock Holmes</b></font>)</div>said Holmes, <div class="bookquote">``however foolish the incident may seem. You have
lost one of your boots, you say?''

 (<font color='red'><b>Holmes/Mr. Holmes/Sherlock Holmes</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Well, mislaid it, anyhow. I put them both outside my door last night,
and there was only one in the morning. I could get no sense out of the
chap who cleans them. The worst of it is that I only bought the pair
last night in the Strand, and I have never had them on.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``If you have never worn them, why did you put them out to be cleaned?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``They were tan boots and had never been varnished. That was why I put
them out.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Then I understand that on your arrival in London yesterday you went out
at once and bought a pair of boots?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I did a good deal of shopping. Dr. Mortimer here went round with me.
You see, if I am to be squire down there I must dress the part, and
it may be that I have got a little careless in my ways out West. Among
other things I bought these brown boots--gave six dollars for them--and
had one stolen before ever I had them on my feet.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``It seems a singularly useless thing to steal,''  (<font color='red'><b>Holmes/Mr. Holmes/Sherlock Holmes</b></font>)</div>said Sherlock Holmes.
<div class="bookquote">``I confess that I share Dr. Mortimer's belief that it will not be long
before the missing boot is found.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``And, now, gentlemen,''  (<font color='red'><b>the baronet</b></font>)</div>said the baronet with decision, <div class="bookquote">``it seems to me
that I have spoken quite enough about the little that I know. It is time
that you kept your promise and gave me a full account of what we are all
driving at.''

 (<font color='red'><b>the baronet</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Your request is a very reasonable one,''  (<font color='red'><b>Holmes/Mr. Holmes/Sherlock Holmes</b></font>)</div>Holmes answered. <div class="bookquote">``Dr. Mortimer,
I think you could not do better than to tell your story as you told it
to us.''

 (<font color='red'><b>friend</b></font>)</div><p/>Thus encouraged, our scientific friend drew his (<font color='blue'><b>Holmes</b></font>) papers from his (<font color='blue'><b>friend</b></font>) pocket
and presented the whole case as he (<font color='blue'><b>friend</b></font>) had done upon the morning before.
Sir Henry Baskerville listened with the deepest attention and with an
occasional exclamation of surprise.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Well, I seem to have come into an inheritance with a vengeance,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>said
he (<font color='blue'><b>Baskerville</b></font>) when the long narrative was finished. <div class="bookquote">``Of course, I've heard of the
hound ever since I was in the nursery. It's the pet story of the family,
though I never thought of taking it seriously before. But as to my
uncle's death--well, it all seems boiling up in my head, and I can't
get it clear yet. You don't seem quite to have made up your mind whether
it's a case for a policeman or a clergyman.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Precisely.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``And now there's this affair of the letter to me at the hotel. I suppose
that fits into its place.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``It seems to show that someone knows more than we do about what goes on
upon the moor,''  (<font color='red'><b>Dr. Mortimer/Mortimer/Dr. James Mortimer</b></font>)</div>said Dr. Mortimer.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``And also,''  (<font color='red'><b>Holmes/Mr. Holmes/Sherlock Holmes</b></font>)</div>said Holmes, <div class="bookquote">``that someone is not ill-disposed towards you,
since they warn you of danger.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Holmes/Mr. Holmes/Sherlock Holmes</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Or it may be that they wish, for their own purposes, to scare me away.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Well, of course, that is possible also. I am very much indebted to you,
Dr. Mortimer, for introducing me to a problem which presents several
interesting alternatives. But the practical point which we now have to
decide, Sir Henry, is whether it is or is not advisable for you to go to
Baskerville Hall.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Why should I not go?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``There seems to be danger.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Do you mean danger from this family fiend or do you mean danger from
human beings?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Well, that is what we have to find out.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Whichever it is, my answer is fixed. There is no devil in hell, Mr.
Holmes, and there is no man upon earth who can prevent me from going to
the home of my own people, and you may take that to be my final answer.''
 (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>His (<font color='blue'><b>Holmes</b></font>) dark brows knitted and his (<font color='blue'><b>Holmes</b></font>) face flushed to a dusky red as he (<font color='blue'><b>Holmes</b></font>) spoke.
It was evident that the fiery temper of the Baskervilles was not extinct
in this their last representative. <div class="bookquote">``Meanwhile,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>said he (<font color='blue'><b>representative</b></font>), <div class="bookquote">``I have hardly
had time to think over all that you have told me. It's a big thing for a
man to have to understand and to decide at one sitting. I should like
to have a quiet hour by myself to make up my mind. Now, look here, Mr.
Holmes, it's half-past eleven now and I am going back right away to my
hotel. Suppose you and your friend, Dr. Watson, come round and lunch
with us at two. I'll be able to tell you more clearly then how this
thing strikes me.''

 (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Is that convenient to you, Watson?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Perfectly.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Then you may expect us. Shall I have a cab called?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I'd prefer to walk, for this affair has flurried me rather.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I'll join you in a walk, with pleasure,''  (<font color='red'><b>companion</b></font>)</div>said his (<font color='blue'><b>representative</b></font>) companion.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Then we meet again at two o’clock. Au revoir, and good-morning!''

 (<font color='red'><b>visitors</b></font>)</div><p/>We heard the steps of our visitors descend the stair and the bang of the
front door. In an instant Holmes had changed from the languid dreamer to
the man of action.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Your hat and boots, Watson, quick! Not a moment to lose!''  (<font color='red'><b>He</b></font>)</div>He (<font color='blue'><b>Holmes</b></font>) rushed
into his (<font color='blue'><b>Holmes</b></font>) room in his (<font color='blue'><b>Holmes</b></font>) dressing-gown and was back again in a few seconds
in a frock-coat. We hurried together down the stairs and into the
street. Dr. Mortimer and Baskerville were still visible about two
hundred yards ahead of us in the direction of Oxford Street.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Shall I run on and stop them?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Not for the world, my dear Watson. I am perfectly satisfied with your
company if you will tolerate mine. Our friends are wise, for it is
certainly a very fine morning for a walk.''

 (<font color='red'><b>He</b></font>)</div><p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Mortimer</b></font>) quickened his (<font color='blue'><b>Mortimer</b></font>) pace until we had decreased the distance which divided
us by about half. Then, still keeping a hundred yards behind, we
followed into Oxford Street and so down Regent Street. Once our friends
stopped and stared into a shop window, upon which Holmes did the
same. An instant afterwards he (<font color='blue'><b>Holmes</b></font>) gave a little cry of satisfaction, and,
following the direction of his (<font color='blue'><b>Holmes</b></font>) eager eyes, I saw that a hansom cab with
a man inside which had halted on the other side of the street was now
proceeding slowly onward again.


<p/><div class="bookquote">``There's our man, Watson! Come along! We'll have a good look at him (<font color='blue'><b>Watson</b></font>), if
we can do no more.''

 (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div><p/>At that instant I was aware of a bushy black beard and a pair of
piercing eyes turned upon us through the side window of the cab.
Instantly the trapdoor at the top flew up, something was screamed to
the driver, and the cab flew madly off down Regent Street. Holmes looked
eagerly round for another, but no empty one was in sight. Then he (<font color='blue'><b>Holmes</b></font>) dashed
in wild pursuit amid the stream of the traffic, but the start was too
great, and already the cab was out of sight.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``There now!''  (<font color='red'><b>Holmes/Mr. Holmes/Sherlock Holmes</b></font>)</div>said Holmes bitterly as he (<font color='blue'><b>Holmes</b></font>) emerged panting and white with
vexation from the tide of vehicles. <div class="bookquote">``Was ever such bad luck and such
bad management, too? Watson, Watson, if you are an honest man you will
record this also and set it against my successes!''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Who was the man?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I have not an idea.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``A spy?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Well, it was evident from what we have heard that Baskerville has been
very closely shadowed by someone since he (<font color='blue'><b>Baskerville</b></font>) has been in town. How else
could it be known so quickly that it was the Northumberland Hotel which
he (<font color='blue'><b>Baskerville</b></font>) had chosen? If they had followed him (<font color='blue'><b>Baskerville</b></font>) the first day I argued that they
would follow him (<font color='blue'><b>Baskerville</b></font>) also the second. You may have observed that I twice
strolled over to the window while Dr. Mortimer was reading his (<font color='blue'><b>Mortimer</b></font>) legend.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Yes, I remember.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I was looking out for loiterers in the street, but I saw none. We
are dealing with a clever man, Watson. This matter cuts very deep, and
though I have not finally made up my mind whether it is a benevolent or
a malevolent agency which is in touch with us, I am conscious always of
power and design. When our friends left I at once followed them in the
hopes of marking down their invisible attendant. So wily was he (<font color='blue'><b>attendant</b></font>) that he (<font color='blue'><b>attendant</b></font>)
had not trusted himself upon foot, but he (<font color='blue'><b>attendant</b></font>) had availed himself of a cab
so that he (<font color='blue'><b>attendant</b></font>) could loiter behind or dash past them and so escape their
notice. His (<font color='blue'><b>attendant</b></font>) method had the additional advantage that if they were to
take a cab he (<font color='blue'><b>attendant</b></font>) was all ready to follow them. It has, however, one obvious
disadvantage.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``It puts him (<font color='blue'><b>attendant</b></font>) in the power of the cabman.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Exactly.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``What a pity we did not get the number!''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``My dear Watson, clumsy as I have been, you surely do not seriously
imagine that I neglected to get the number? No. 2704 is our man. But
that is no use to us for the moment.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I fail to see how you could have done more.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``On observing the cab I should have instantly turned and walked in the
other direction. I should then at my leisure have hired a second cab
and followed the first at a respectful distance, or, better still, have
driven to the Northumberland Hotel and waited there. When our unknown
had followed Baskerville home we should have had the opportunity of
playing his (<font color='blue'><b>Baskerville</b></font>) own game upon himself and seeing where he (<font color='blue'><b>Baskerville</b></font>) made for. As
it is, by an indiscreet eagerness, which was taken advantage of with
extraordinary quickness and energy by our opponent, we have betrayed
ourselves and lost our man.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Regent</b></font>)</div><p/>We had been sauntering slowly down Regent Street during this
conversation, and Dr. Mortimer, with his (<font color='blue'><b>Mortimer</b></font>) companion, had long vanished in
front of us.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``There is no object in our following them,''  (<font color='red'><b>Holmes/Mr. Holmes/Sherlock Holmes</b></font>)</div>said Holmes. <div class="bookquote">``The shadow has
departed and will not return. We must see what further cards we have
in our hands and play them with decision. Could you swear to that man's
face within the cab?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I could swear only to the beard.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``And so could I--from which I gather that in all probability it was
a false one. A clever man upon so delicate an errand has no use for a
beard save to conceal his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) features. Come in here, Watson!''

 (<font color='red'><b>He</b></font>)</div><p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Holmes</b></font>) turned into one of the district messenger offices, where he (<font color='blue'><b>Holmes</b></font>) was
warmly greeted by the manager.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Ah, Wilson, I see you have not forgotten the little case in which I had
the good fortune to help you?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``No, sir, indeed I have not. You saved my good name, and perhaps my
life.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``My dear fellow, you exaggerate. I have some recollection, Wilson, that
you had among your boys a lad named Cartwright, who showed some ability
during the investigation.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Yes, sir, he (<font color='blue'><b>Cartwright</b></font>) is still with us.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Could you ring him (<font color='blue'><b>Cartwright</b></font>) up?--thank you! And I should be glad to have change
of this five-pound note.''

 (<font color='red'><b>A lad</b></font>)</div><p/>A lad of fourteen, with a bright, keen face, had obeyed the summons
of the manager. He (<font color='blue'><b>manager</b></font>) stood now gazing with great reverence at the famous
detective.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Let me have the Hotel Directory,''  (<font color='red'><b>Holmes/Mr. Holmes/Sherlock Holmes</b></font>)</div>said Holmes. <div class="bookquote">``Thank you! Now,
Cartwright, there are the names of twenty-three hotels here, all in the
immediate neighbourhood of Charing Cross. Do you see?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Yes, sir.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``You will visit each of these in turn.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Yes, sir.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``You will begin in each case by giving the outside porter one shilling.

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Yes, sir.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``You will tell him (<font color='blue'><b>porter</b></font>) that you want to see the waste-paper of yesterday.
You will say that an important telegram has miscarried and that you are
looking for it. You understand?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Yes, sir.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``But what you are really looking for is the centre page of the Times
with some holes cut in it with scissors. Here is a copy of the Times. It
is this page. You could easily recognize it, could you not?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Yes, sir.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``In each case the outside porter will send for the hall porter, to whom
also you will give a shilling. Here are twenty-three shillings. You will
then learn in possibly twenty cases out of the twenty-three that the
waste of the day before has been burned or removed. In the three other
cases you will be shown a heap of paper and you will look for this page
of the Times among it. The odds are enormously against your finding
it. There are ten shillings over in case of emergencies. Let me have a
report by wire at Baker Street before evening. And now, Watson, it only
remains for us to find out by wire the identity of the cabman, No. 2704,
and then we will drop into one of the Bond Street picture galleries and
fill in the time until we are due at the hotel.''




 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/>Chapter 5. Three Broken Threads



<p/>Sherlock Holmes had, in a very remarkable degree, the power of detaching
his (<font color='blue'><b>Holmes</b></font>) mind at will. For two hours the strange business in which we had
been involved appeared to be forgotten, and he (<font color='blue'><b>Holmes</b></font>) was entirely absorbed in
the pictures of the modern Belgian masters. He (<font color='blue'><b>Holmes</b></font>) would talk of nothing
but art, of which he (<font color='blue'><b>Holmes</b></font>) had the crudest ideas, from our leaving the gallery
until we found ourselves at the Northumberland Hotel.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Sir Henry Baskerville is upstairs expecting you,''  (<font color='red'><b>the clerk</b></font>)</div>said the clerk. <div class="bookquote">``He (<font color='blue'><b>Baskerville</b></font>)
asked me to show you up at once when you came.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Have you any objection to my looking at your register?''  (<font color='red'><b>Holmes/Mr. Holmes/Sherlock Holmes</b></font>)</div>said Holmes.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Not in the least.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/>The book showed that two names had been added after that of Baskerville.
One was Theophilus Johnson and family, of Newcastle; the other Mrs.
Oldmore and maid, of High Lodge, Alton.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Surely that must be the same Johnson whom I used to know,''  (<font color='red'><b>Holmes/Mr. Holmes/Sherlock Holmes</b></font>)</div>said Holmes
to the porter. <div class="bookquote">``A lawyer, is he (<font color='blue'><b>lawyer</b></font>) not, gray-headed, and walks with a
limp?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``No, sir, this is Mr. Johnson, the coal-owner, a very active gentleman,
not older than yourself.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Surely you are mistaken about his (<font color='blue'><b>Johnson</b></font>) trade?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``No, sir! he (<font color='blue'><b>Johnson</b></font>) has used this hotel for many years, and he (<font color='blue'><b>Johnson</b></font>) is very well
known to us.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Ah, that settles it. Mrs. Oldmore, too; I seem to remember the name.
Excuse my curiosity, but often in calling upon one friend one finds
another.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``She (<font color='blue'><b>Oldmore</b></font>) is an invalid lady, sir. Her (<font color='blue'><b>Oldmore</b></font>) husband was once mayor of Gloucester.
She (<font color='blue'><b>Oldmore</b></font>) always comes to us when she (<font color='blue'><b>Oldmore</b></font>) is in town.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Thank you; I am afraid I cannot claim her (<font color='blue'><b>Oldmore</b></font>) acquaintance. We have
established a most important fact by these questions, Watson,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Holmes</b></font>)
continued in a low voice as we went upstairs together. <div class="bookquote">``We know now that
the people who are so interested in our friend have not settled down
in his (<font color='blue'><b>friend</b></font>) own hotel. That means that while they are, as we have seen, very
anxious to watch him (<font color='blue'><b>friend</b></font>), they are equally anxious that he (<font color='blue'><b>friend</b></font>) should not see
them. Now, this is a most suggestive fact.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``What does it suggest?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``It suggests--halloa, my dear fellow, what on earth is the matter?''

 (<font color='red'><b>Henry/Henry Baskerville/Baskerville</b></font>)</div><p/>As we came round the top of the stairs we had run up against Sir Henry
Baskerville himself. His (<font color='blue'><b>Baskerville</b></font>) face was flushed with anger, and he (<font color='blue'><b>Baskerville</b></font>) held an old
and dusty boot in one of his (<font color='blue'><b>Baskerville</b></font>) hands. So furious was he (<font color='blue'><b>Baskerville</b></font>) that he (<font color='blue'><b>Baskerville</b></font>) was hardly
articulate, and when he (<font color='blue'><b>Baskerville</b></font>) did speak it was in a much broader and more
Western dialect than any which we had heard from him (<font color='blue'><b>Baskerville</b></font>) in the morning.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Seems to me they are playing me for a sucker in this hotel,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Baskerville</b></font>) cried.
<div class="bookquote">``They'll find they've started in to monkey with the wrong man unless
they are careful. By thunder, if that chap can't find my missing boot
there will be trouble. I can take a joke with the best, Mr. Holmes, but
they've got a bit over the mark this time.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Still looking for your boot?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Yes, sir, and mean to find it.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``But, surely, you said that it was a new brown boot?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``So it was, sir. And now it's an old black one.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``What! you don't mean to say--?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``That's just what I do mean to say. I only had three pairs in the
world--the new brown, the old black, and the patent leathers, which I am
wearing. Last night they took one of my brown ones, and today they have
sneaked one of the black. Well, have you got it? Speak out, man, and
don't stand staring!''

 (<font color='red'><b>An waiter</b></font>)</div><p/>An agitated German waiter had appeared upon the scene.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``No, sir; I have made inquiry all over the hotel, but I can hear no word
of it.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Well, either that boot comes back before sundown or I'll see the
manager and tell him (<font color='blue'><b>manager</b></font>) that I go right straight out of this hotel.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``It shall be found, sir--I promise you that if you will have a little
patience it will be found.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Mind it is, for it's the last thing of mine that I'll lose in this den
of thieves. Well, well, Mr. Holmes, you'll excuse my troubling you about
such a trifle--''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I think it's well worth troubling about.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Why, you look very serious over it.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``How do you explain it?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I just don't attempt to explain it. It seems the very maddest, queerest
thing that ever happened to me.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``The queerest perhaps--''  (<font color='red'><b>Holmes/Mr. Holmes/Sherlock Holmes</b></font>)</div>said Holmes thoughtfully.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``What do you make of it yourself?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Well, I don't profess to understand it yet. This case of yours is very
complex, Sir Henry. When taken in conjunction with your uncle's death
I am not sure that of all the five hundred cases of capital importance
which I have handled there is one which cuts so deep. But we hold
several threads in our hands, and the odds are that one or other of them
guides us to the truth. We may waste time in following the wrong one,
but sooner or later we must come upon the right.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/>We had a pleasant luncheon in which little was said of the business
which had brought us together. It was in the private sitting-room to
which we afterwards repaired that Holmes asked Baskerville what were his (<font color='blue'><b>Holmes</b></font>)
intentions.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``To go to Baskerville Hall.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``And when?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``At the end of the week.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``On the whole,''  (<font color='red'><b>Holmes/Mr. Holmes/Sherlock Holmes</b></font>)</div>said Holmes, <div class="bookquote">``I think that your decision is a wise one.
I have ample evidence that you are being dogged in London, and amid the
millions of this great city it is difficult to discover who these people
are or what their object can be. If their intentions are evil they might
do you a mischief, and we should be powerless to prevent it. You did not
know, Dr. Mortimer, that you were followed this morning from my house?''

 (<font color='red'><b>Holmes/Mr. Holmes/Sherlock Holmes</b></font>)</div><p/>Dr. Mortimer started violently. <div class="bookquote">``Followed! By whom?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``That, unfortunately, is what I cannot tell you. Have you among your
neighbours or acquaintances on Dartmoor any man with a black, full
beard?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``No--or, let me see--why, yes. Barrymore, Sir Charles's butler, is a man
with a full, black beard.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Ha! Where is Barrymore?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``He (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) is in charge of the Hall.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``We had best ascertain if he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) is really there, or if by any possibility
he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) might be in London.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``How can you do that?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Give me a telegraph form. `Is all ready for Sir Henry?' That will
do. Address to Mr. Barrymore, Baskerville Hall. What is the nearest
telegraph-office? Grimpen. Very good, we will send a second wire to the
postmaster, Grimpen: `Telegram to Mr. Barrymore to be delivered into
his (<font color='blue'><b>Barrymore</b></font>) own hand. If absent, please return wire to Sir Henry Baskerville,
Northumberland Hotel.' That should let us know before evening whether
Barrymore is at his (<font color='blue'><b>Baskerville</b></font>) post in Devonshire or not.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``That's so,''  (<font color='red'><b>Charles/Baskerville/Charles Baskerville</b></font>)</div>said Baskerville. <div class="bookquote">``By the way, Dr. Mortimer, who is this
Barrymore, anyhow?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``He (<font color='blue'><b>Mortimer</b></font>) is the son of the old caretaker, who is dead. They have looked after
the Hall for four generations now. So far as I know, he (<font color='blue'><b>Mortimer</b></font>) and his (<font color='blue'><b>Mortimer</b></font>) wife are
as respectable a couple as any in the county.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``At the same time,''  (<font color='red'><b>Charles/Baskerville/Charles Baskerville</b></font>)</div>said Baskerville, <div class="bookquote">``it's clear enough that so long as
there are none of the family at the Hall these people have a mighty fine
home and nothing to do.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Charles/Baskerville/Charles Baskerville</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``That is true.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Did Barrymore profit at all by Sir Charles's will?''  (<font color='red'><b>Holmes/Mr. Holmes/Sherlock Holmes</b></font>)</div>asked Holmes.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``He (<font color='blue'><b>Charles</b></font>) and his (<font color='blue'><b>Charles</b></font>) wife had five hundred pounds each.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Ha! Did they know that they would receive this?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Yes; Sir Charles was very fond of talking about the provisions of his (<font color='blue'><b>Charles</b></font>)
will.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``That is very interesting.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I hope,''  (<font color='red'><b>Dr. Mortimer/Mortimer/Dr. James Mortimer</b></font>)</div>said Dr. Mortimer, <div class="bookquote">``that you do not look with suspicious eyes
upon everyone who received a legacy from Sir Charles, for I also had a
thousand pounds left to me.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Dr. Mortimer/Mortimer/Dr. James Mortimer</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Indeed! And anyone else?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``There were many insignificant sums to individuals, and a large number
of public charities. The residue all went to Sir Henry.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``And how much was the residue?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Seven hundred and forty thousand pounds.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Holmes/Mr. Holmes/Sherlock Holmes</b></font>)</div><p/>Holmes raised his (<font color='blue'><b>Mortimer</b></font>) eyebrows in surprise. <div class="bookquote">``I had no idea that so gigantic
a sum was involved,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>said he (<font color='blue'><b>Mortimer</b></font>).

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Sir Charles had the reputation of being rich, but we did not know how
very rich he (<font color='blue'><b>Charles</b></font>) was until we came to examine his (<font color='blue'><b>Charles</b></font>) securities. The total
value of the estate was close on to a million.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Dear me! It is a stake for which a man might well play a desperate
game. And one more question, Dr. Mortimer. Supposing that anything
happened to our young friend here--you will forgive the unpleasant
hypothesis!--who would inherit the estate?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Since Rodger Baskerville, Sir Charles's younger brother died unmarried,
the estate would descend to the Desmonds, who are distant cousins. James
Desmond is an elderly clergyman in Westmoreland.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Thank you. These details are all of great interest. Have you met Mr.
James Desmond?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Yes; he (<font color='blue'><b>Desmond</b></font>) once came down to visit Sir Charles. He (<font color='blue'><b>Charles</b></font>) is a man of venerable
appearance and of saintly life. I remember that he (<font color='blue'><b>Charles</b></font>) refused to accept any
settlement from Sir Charles, though he (<font color='blue'><b>Charles</b></font>) pressed it upon him (<font color='blue'><b>Charles</b></font>).''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``And this man of simple tastes would be the heir to Sir Charles's
thousands.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``He (<font color='blue'><b>Charles</b></font>) would be the heir to the estate because that is entailed. He (<font color='blue'><b>Charles</b></font>) would
also be the heir to the money unless it were willed otherwise by the
present owner, who can, of course, do what he (<font color='blue'><b>owner</b></font>) likes with it.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``And have you made your will, Sir Henry?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``No, Mr. Holmes, I have not. I've had no time, for it was only yesterday
that I learned how matters stood. But in any case I feel that the money
should go with the title and estate. That was my poor uncle's idea. How
is the owner going to restore the glories of the Baskervilles if he (<font color='blue'><b>owner</b></font>) has
not money enough to keep up the property? House, land, and dollars must
go together.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Quite so. Well, Sir Henry, I am of one mind with you as to the
advisability of your going down to Devonshire without delay. There is
only one provision which I must make. You certainly must not go alone.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Dr. Mortimer returns with me.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``But Dr. Mortimer has his (<font color='blue'><b>Mortimer</b></font>) practice to attend to, and his (<font color='blue'><b>Mortimer</b></font>) house is miles
away from yours. With all the goodwill in the world he (<font color='blue'><b>Mortimer</b></font>) may be unable to
help you. No, Sir Henry, you must take with you someone, a trusty man,
who will be always by your side.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Is it possible that you could come yourself, Mr. Holmes?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``If matters came to a crisis I should endeavour to be present in person;
but you can understand that, with my extensive consulting practice
and with the constant appeals which reach me from many quarters, it is
impossible for me to be absent from London for an indefinite time. At
the present instant one of the most revered names in England is being
besmirched by a blackmailer, and only I can stop a disastrous scandal.
You will see how impossible it is for me to go to Dartmoor.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Whom would you recommend, then?''

 (<font color='red'><b>Holmes/Mr. Holmes/Sherlock Holmes</b></font>)</div><p/>Holmes laid his (<font color='blue'><b>Holmes</b></font>) hand upon my arm. <div class="bookquote">``If my friend would undertake it there
is no man who is better worth having at your side when you are in a
tight place. No one can say so more confidently than I.''

 (<font color='red'><b>me</b></font>)</div><p/>The proposition took me completely by surprise, but before I had time to
answer, Baskerville seized me by the hand and wrung it heartily.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Well, now, that is real kind of you, Dr. Watson,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>said he (<font color='blue'><b>Baskerville</b></font>). <div class="bookquote">``You see how
it is with me, and you know just as much about the matter as I do. If
you will come down to Baskerville Hall and see me through I'll never
forget it.''

 (<font color='red'><b>me</b></font>)</div><p/>The promise of adventure had always a fascination for me, and I was
complimented by the words of Holmes and by the eagerness with which the
baronet hailed me as a companion.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``I will come, with pleasure,''  (<font color='red'><b>I.</b></font>)</div>said I. <div class="bookquote">``I do not know how I could employ
my time better.''

 (<font color='red'><b>I.</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``And you will report very carefully to me,''  (<font color='red'><b>Holmes/Mr. Holmes/Sherlock Holmes</b></font>)</div>said Holmes. <div class="bookquote">``When a crisis
comes, as it will do, I will direct how you shall act. I suppose that by
Saturday all might be ready?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Would that suit Dr. Watson?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Perfectly.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Then on Saturday, unless you hear to the contrary, we shall meet at the
ten-thirty train from Paddington.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Charles/Baskerville/Charles Baskerville</b></font>)</div><p/>We had risen to depart when Baskerville gave a cry, of triumph, and
diving into one of the corners of the room he (<font color='blue'><b>Baskerville</b></font>) drew a brown boot from
under a cabinet.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``My missing boot!''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Baskerville</b></font>) cried.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``May all our difficulties vanish as easily!''  (<font color='red'><b>Holmes/Mr. Holmes/Sherlock Holmes</b></font>)</div>said Sherlock Holmes.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``But it is a very singular thing,''  (<font color='red'><b>Dr. Mortimer/Mortimer/Dr. James Mortimer</b></font>)</div>Dr. Mortimer remarked. <div class="bookquote">``I searched
this room carefully before lunch.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``And so did I,''  (<font color='red'><b>Charles/Baskerville/Charles Baskerville</b></font>)</div>said Baskerville. <div class="bookquote">``Every inch of it.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``There was certainly no boot in it then.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``In that case the waiter must have placed it there while we were
lunching.''

 (<font color='red'><b>The German</b></font>)</div><p/>The German was sent for but professed to know nothing of the matter,
nor could any inquiry clear it up. Another item had been added to that
constant and apparently purposeless series of small mysteries which had
succeeded each other so rapidly. Setting aside the whole grim story of
Sir Charles's death, we had a line of inexplicable incidents all within
the limits of two days, which included the receipt of the printed
letter, the black-bearded spy in the hansom, the loss of the new brown
boot, the loss of the old black boot, and now the return of the new
brown boot. Holmes sat in silence in the cab as we drove back to Baker
Street, and I knew from his (<font color='blue'><b>Baker</b></font>) drawn brows and keen face that his (<font color='blue'><b>Baker</b></font>) mind,
like my own, was busy in endeavouring to frame some scheme into which
all these strange and apparently disconnected episodes could be fitted.
All afternoon and late into the evening he (<font color='blue'><b>Baker</b></font>) sat lost in tobacco and
thought.

<p/>Just before dinner two telegrams were handed in. The first ran:

<p/>Have just heard that Barrymore is at the Hall. BASKERVILLE.

<p/>The second:

<p/>Visited twenty-three hotels as directed, but sorry, to report unable to
trace cut sheet of Times. CARTWRIGHT.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``There go two of my threads, Watson. There is nothing more stimulating
than a case where everything goes against you. We must cast round for
another scent.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``We have still the cabman who drove the spy.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Exactly. I have wired to get his (<font color='blue'><b>spy</b></font>) name and address from the Official
Registry. I should not be surprised if this were an answer to my
question.''

 (<font color='red'><b>a fellow</b></font>)</div><p/>The ring at the bell proved to be something even more satisfactory
than an answer, however, for the door opened and a rough-looking fellow
entered who was evidently the man himself.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``I got a message from the head office that a gent at this address had
been inquiring for No. 2704,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>said he (<font color='blue'><b>fellow</b></font>). <div class="bookquote">``I've driven my cab this seven
years and never a word of complaint. I came here straight from the Yard
to ask you to your face what you had against me.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I have nothing in the world against you, my good man,''  (<font color='red'><b>Holmes/Mr. Holmes/Sherlock Holmes</b></font>)</div>said Holmes.
<div class="bookquote">``On the contrary, I have half a sovereign for you if you will give me a
clear answer to my questions.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Well, I've had a good day and no mistake,''  (<font color='red'><b>the cabman</b></font>)</div>said the cabman with a grin.
<div class="bookquote">``What was it you wanted to ask, sir?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``First of all your name and address, in case I want you again.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``John Clayton, 3 Turpey Street, the Borough. My cab is out of Shipley's
Yard, near Waterloo Station.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Holmes/Mr. Holmes/Sherlock Holmes</b></font>)</div><p/>Sherlock Holmes made a note of it.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Now, Clayton, tell me all about the fare who came and watched this
house at ten o’clock this morning and afterwards followed the two
gentlemen down Regent Street.''

 (<font color='red'><b>The man</b></font>)</div><p/>The man looked surprised and a little embarrassed. <div class="bookquote">``Why, there's no good
my telling you things, for you seem to know as much as I do already,''
 (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>said he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>). <div class="bookquote">``The truth is that the gentleman told me that he (<font color='blue'><b>gentleman</b></font>) was a
detective and that I was to say nothing about him (<font color='blue'><b>gentleman</b></font>) to anyone.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``My good fellow; this is a very serious business, and you may find
yourself in a pretty bad position if you try to hide anything from me.
You say that your fare told you that he (<font color='blue'><b>fellow</b></font>) was a detective?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Yes, he (<font color='blue'><b>fellow</b></font>) did.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``When did he (<font color='blue'><b>fellow</b></font>) say this?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Did he (<font color='blue'><b>fellow</b></font>) say anything more?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``He (<font color='blue'><b>fellow</b></font>) mentioned his (<font color='blue'><b>fellow</b></font>) name.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Holmes/Mr. Holmes/Sherlock Holmes</b></font>)</div><p/>Holmes cast a swift glance of triumph at me. <div class="bookquote">``Oh, he (<font color='blue'><b>fellow</b></font>) mentioned his (<font color='blue'><b>fellow</b></font>) name,
did he (<font color='blue'><b>fellow</b></font>)? That was imprudent. What was the name that he (<font color='blue'><b>fellow</b></font>) mentioned?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``His (<font color='blue'><b>fellow</b></font>) name,''  (<font color='red'><b>the cabman</b></font>)</div>said the cabman, <div class="bookquote">``was Mr. Sherlock Holmes.''

 (<font color='red'><b>the cabman</b></font>)</div><p/>Never have I seen my friend more completely taken aback than by the
cabman's reply. For an instant he (<font color='blue'><b>friend</b></font>) sat in silent amazement. Then he (<font color='blue'><b>friend</b></font>) burst
into a hearty laugh.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``A touch, Watson--an undeniable touch!''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>said he (<font color='blue'><b>friend</b></font>). <div class="bookquote">``I feel a foil as quick
and supple as my own. He (<font color='blue'><b>Holmes</b></font>) got home upon me very prettily that time. So
his (<font color='blue'><b>Holmes</b></font>) name was Sherlock Holmes, was it?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Yes, sir, that was the gentleman's name.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Excellent! Tell me where you picked him (<font color='blue'><b>Holmes</b></font>) up and all that occurred.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``He (<font color='blue'><b>Holmes</b></font>) hailed me at half-past nine in Trafalgar Square. He (<font color='blue'><b>Holmes</b></font>) said that he (<font color='blue'><b>Holmes</b></font>) was
a detective, and he (<font color='blue'><b>Holmes</b></font>) offered me two guineas if I would do exactly what he (<font color='blue'><b>Holmes</b></font>)
wanted all day and ask no questions. I was glad enough to agree. First
we drove down to the Northumberland Hotel and waited there until two
gentlemen came out and took a cab from the rank. We followed their cab
until it pulled up somewhere near here.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``This very door,''  (<font color='red'><b>Holmes/Mr. Holmes/Sherlock Holmes</b></font>)</div>said Holmes.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Well, I couldn't be sure of that, but I dare say my fare knew all about
it. We pulled up halfway down the street and waited an hour and a half.

 (<font color='red'><b>Holmes/Mr. Holmes/Sherlock Holmes</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I know,''  (<font color='red'><b>Holmes/Mr. Holmes/Sherlock Holmes</b></font>)</div>said Holmes.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Until we got three-quarters down Regent Street. Then my gentleman threw
up the trap, and he (<font color='blue'><b>gentleman</b></font>) cried that I should drive right away to Waterloo

under the ten minutes. Then he (<font color='blue'><b>gentleman</b></font>) paid up his (<font color='blue'><b>gentleman</b></font>) two guineas, like a good one,
and away he (<font color='blue'><b>gentleman</b></font>) went into the station. Only just as he (<font color='blue'><b>gentleman</b></font>) was leaving he (<font color='blue'><b>gentleman</b></font>) turned
round and he (<font color='blue'><b>gentleman</b></font>) said: `It might interest you to know that you have been

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``And how would you describe Mr. Sherlock Holmes?''

 (<font color='red'><b>The cabman</b></font>)</div><p/>The cabman scratched his (<font color='blue'><b>Holmes</b></font>) head. <div class="bookquote">``Well, he (<font color='blue'><b>Holmes</b></font>) wasn't altogether such an easy
gentleman to describe. I'd put him (<font color='blue'><b>Holmes</b></font>) at forty years of age, and he (<font color='blue'><b>Holmes</b></font>) was
of a middle height, two or three inches shorter than you, sir. He (<font color='blue'><b>Holmes</b></font>) was
dressed like a toff, and he (<font color='blue'><b>Holmes</b></font>) had a black beard, cut square at the end,
and a pale face. I don't know as I could say more than that.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Colour of his (<font color='blue'><b>Holmes</b></font>) eyes?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``No, I can't say that.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Nothing more that you can remember?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``No, sir; nothing.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Well, then, here is your half-sovereign. There's another one waiting
for you if you can bring any more information. Good-night!''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Good-night, sir, and thank you!''

 (<font color='red'><b>John/John Clayton/Clayton</b></font>)</div><p/>John Clayton departed chuckling, and Holmes turned to me with a shrug of
his (<font color='blue'><b>Holmes</b></font>) shoulders and a rueful smile.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Snap goes our third thread, and we end where we began,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>said he (<font color='blue'><b>Holmes</b></font>). <div class="bookquote">``The
cunning rascal! He (<font color='blue'><b>rascal</b></font>) knew our number, knew that Sir Henry Baskerville had
consulted me, spotted who I was in Regent Street, conjectured that I had
got the number of the cab and would lay my hands on the driver, and so
sent back this audacious message. I tell you, Watson, this time we have
got a foeman who is worthy of our steel. I've been checkmated in London.
I can only wish you better luck in Devonshire. But I'm not easy in my
mind about it.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``About what?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``About sending you. It's an ugly business, Watson, an ugly dangerous
business, and the more I see of it the less I like it. Yes, my dear
fellow, you may laugh, but I give you my word that I shall be very glad
to have you back safe and sound in Baker Street once more.''




 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/>Chapter 6. Baskerville Hall



<p/>Sir Henry Baskerville and Dr. Mortimer were ready upon the appointed
day, and we started as arranged for Devonshire. Mr. Sherlock Holmes
drove with me to the station and gave me his (<font color='blue'><b>Holmes</b></font>) last parting injunctions
and advice.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``I will not bias your mind by suggesting theories or suspicions,
Watson,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>said he (<font color='blue'><b>Holmes</b></font>); <div class="bookquote">``I wish you simply to report facts in the fullest
possible manner to me, and you can leave me to do the theorizing.''

 (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``What sort of facts?''  (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div>I asked.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Anything which may seem to have a bearing however indirect upon the
case, and especially the relations between young Baskerville and his (<font color='blue'><b>Baskerville</b></font>)
neighbours or any fresh particulars concerning the death of Sir Charles.
I have made some inquiries myself in the last few days, but the results
have, I fear, been negative. One thing only appears to be certain, and
that is that Mr. James Desmond, who is the next heir, is an elderly
gentleman of a very amiable disposition, so that this persecution does
not arise from him (<font color='blue'><b>Desmond</b></font>). I really think that we may eliminate him (<font color='blue'><b>Desmond</b></font>) entirely
from our calculations. There remain the people who will actually
surround Sir Henry Baskerville upon the moor.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Would it not be well in the first place to get rid of this Barrymore
couple?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``By no means. You could not make a greater mistake. If they are innocent
it would be a cruel injustice, and if they are guilty we should be
giving up all chance of bringing it home to them. No, no, we will
preserve them upon our list of suspects. Then there is a groom at the
Hall, if I remember right. There are two moorland farmers. There is our
friend Dr. Mortimer, whom I believe to be entirely honest, and there is
his (<font color='blue'><b>Mortimer</b></font>) wife, of whom we know nothing. There is this naturalist, Stapleton,
and there is his (<font color='blue'><b>Stapleton</b></font>) sister, who is said to be a young lady of attractions.
There is Mr. Frankland, of Lafter Hall, who is also an unknown factor,
and there are one or two other neighbours. These are the folk who must
be your very special study.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I will do my best.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``You have arms, I suppose?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Yes, I thought it as well to take them.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Most certainly. Keep your revolver near you night and day, and never
relax your precautions.''

 (<font color='red'><b>friends</b></font>)</div><p/>Our friends had already secured a first-class carriage and were waiting
for us upon the platform.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``No, we have no news of any kind,''  (<font color='red'><b>Dr. Mortimer/Mortimer/Dr. James Mortimer</b></font>)</div>said Dr. Mortimer in answer to my
friend's questions. <div class="bookquote">``I can swear to one thing, and that is that we
have not been shadowed during the last two days. We have never gone
out without keeping a sharp watch, and no one could have escaped our
notice.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``You have always kept together, I presume?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Except yesterday afternoon. I usually give up one day to pure amusement
when I come to town, so I spent it at the Museum of the College of
Surgeons.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``And I went to look at the folk in the park,''  (<font color='red'><b>Charles/Baskerville/Charles Baskerville</b></font>)</div>said Baskerville.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``But we had no trouble of any kind.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``It was imprudent, all the same,''  (<font color='red'><b>Holmes/Mr. Holmes/Sherlock Holmes</b></font>)</div>said Holmes, shaking his (<font color='blue'><b>Holmes</b></font>) head and
looking very grave. <div class="bookquote">``I beg, Sir Henry, that you will not go about alone.
Some great misfortune will befall you if you do. Did you get your other
boot?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``No, sir, it is gone forever.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Indeed. That is very interesting. Well, good-bye,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Holmes</b></font>) added as the
train began to glide down the platform. <div class="bookquote">``Bear in mind, Sir Henry, one of
the phrases in that queer old legend which Dr. Mortimer has read to us,
and avoid the moor in those hours of darkness when the powers of evil
are exalted.''

 (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div><p/>I looked back at the platform when we had left it far behind and saw the
tall, austere figure of Holmes standing motionless and gazing after us.

<p/>The journey was a swift and pleasant one, and I spent it in making the
more intimate acquaintance of my two companions and in playing with
Dr. Mortimer's spaniel. In a very few hours the brown earth had
become ruddy, the brick had changed to granite, and red cows grazed in
well-hedged fields where the lush grasses and more luxuriant vegetation
spoke of a richer, if a damper, climate. Young Baskerville stared
eagerly out of the window and cried aloud with delight as he (<font color='blue'><b>Baskerville</b></font>) recognized
the familiar features of the Devon scenery.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``I've been over a good part of the world since I left it, Dr. Watson,''
 (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>said he (<font color='blue'><b>Baskerville</b></font>); <div class="bookquote">``but I have never seen a place to compare with it.''

 (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I never saw a Devonshire man who did not swear by his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) county,''  (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div>I
remarked.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``It depends upon the breed of men quite as much as on the county,''  (<font color='red'><b>Dr. Mortimer/Mortimer/Dr. James Mortimer</b></font>)</div>said
Dr. Mortimer. <div class="bookquote">``A glance at our friend here reveals the rounded head of
the Celt, which carries inside it the Celtic enthusiasm and power
of attachment. Poor Sir Charles's head was of a very rare type, half
Gaelic, half Ivernian in its characteristics. But you were very young
when you last saw Baskerville Hall, were you not?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I was a boy in my teens at the time of my father's death and had never
seen the Hall, for he (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) lived in a little cottage on the South Coast.
Thence I went straight to a friend in America. I tell you it is all as
new to me as it is to Dr. Watson, and I'm as keen as possible to see the
moor.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Are you? Then your wish is easily granted, for there is your first
sight of the moor,''  (<font color='red'><b>Dr. Mortimer/Mortimer/Dr. James Mortimer</b></font>)</div>said Dr. Mortimer, pointing out of the carriage
window.

<p/>Over the green squares of the fields and the low curve of a wood there
rose in the distance a gray, melancholy hill, with a strange jagged
summit, dim and vague in the distance, like some fantastic landscape in
a dream. Baskerville sat for a long time, his (<font color='blue'><b>Baskerville</b></font>) eyes fixed upon it, and I
read upon his (<font color='blue'><b>Baskerville</b></font>) eager face how much it meant to him (<font color='blue'><b>Baskerville</b></font>), this first sight of
that strange spot where the men of his (<font color='blue'><b>Baskerville</b></font>) blood had held sway so long
and left their mark so deep. There he (<font color='blue'><b>Baskerville</b></font>) sat, with his (<font color='blue'><b>Baskerville</b></font>) tweed suit and his (<font color='blue'><b>Baskerville</b></font>)
American accent, in the corner of a prosaic railway-carriage, and yet as
I looked at his (<font color='blue'><b>Baskerville</b></font>) dark and expressive face I felt more than ever how
true a descendant he (<font color='blue'><b>Baskerville</b></font>) was of that long line of high-blooded, fiery,
and masterful men. There were pride, valour, and strength in his (<font color='blue'><b>Baskerville</b></font>) thick
brows, his (<font color='blue'><b>Baskerville</b></font>) sensitive nostrils, and his (<font color='blue'><b>Baskerville</b></font>) large hazel eyes. If on that
forbidding moor a difficult and dangerous quest should lie before us,
this was at least a comrade for whom one might venture to take a risk
with the certainty that he (<font color='blue'><b>comrade</b></font>) would bravely share it.

<p/>The train pulled up at a small wayside station and we all descended.
Outside, beyond the low, white fence, a wagonette with a pair of cobs
was waiting. Our coming was evidently a great event, for station-master
and porters clustered round us to carry out our luggage. It was a sweet,
simple country spot, but I was surprised to observe that by the gate
there stood two soldierly men in dark uniforms who leaned upon their
short rifles and glanced keenly at us as we passed. The coachman, a
hard-faced, gnarled little fellow, saluted Sir Henry Baskerville, and in
a few minutes we were flying swiftly down the broad, white road. Rolling
pasture lands curved upward on either side of us, and old gabled houses
peeped out from amid the thick green foliage, but behind the peaceful
and sunlit countryside there rose ever, dark against the evening sky,
the long, gloomy curve of the moor, broken by the jagged and sinister
hills.

<p/>The wagonette swung round into a side road, and we curved upward through
deep lanes worn by centuries of wheels, high banks on either side, heavy
with dripping moss and fleshy hart's-tongue ferns. Bronzing bracken and
mottled bramble gleamed in the light of the sinking sun. Still steadily
rising, we passed over a narrow granite bridge and skirted a noisy
stream which gushed swiftly down, foaming and roaring amid the gray
boulders. Both road and stream wound up through a valley dense with
scrub oak and fir. At every turn Baskerville gave an exclamation of
delight, looking eagerly about him (<font color='blue'><b>Baskerville</b></font>) and asking countless questions. To
his (<font color='blue'><b>Baskerville</b></font>) eyes all seemed beautiful, but to me a tinge of melancholy lay upon
the countryside, which bore so clearly the mark of the waning year.
Yellow leaves carpeted the lanes and fluttered down upon us as we
passed. The rattle of our wheels died away as we drove through drifts of
rotting vegetation--sad gifts, as it seemed to me, for Nature to throw
before the carriage of the returning heir of the Baskervilles.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Halloa!''  (<font color='red'><b>Dr. Mortimer/Mortimer/Dr. James Mortimer</b></font>)</div>cried Dr. Mortimer, <div class="bookquote">``what is this?''

 (<font color='red'><b>Dr. Mortimer/Mortimer/Dr. James Mortimer</b></font>)</div><p/>A steep curve of heath-clad land, an outlying spur of the moor, lay in
front of us. On the summit, hard and clear like an equestrian statue
upon its pedestal, was a mounted soldier, dark and stern, his (<font color='blue'><b>soldier</b></font>) rifle
poised ready over his (<font color='blue'><b>soldier</b></font>) forearm. He (<font color='blue'><b>soldier</b></font>) was watching the road along which we
travelled.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``What is this, Perkins?''  (<font color='red'><b>Dr. Mortimer/Mortimer/Dr. James Mortimer</b></font>)</div>asked Dr. Mortimer.

<p/>Our driver half turned in his (<font color='blue'><b>Mortimer</b></font>) seat. <div class="bookquote">``There's a convict escaped from
Princetown, sir. He (<font color='blue'><b>Perkins</b></font>)'s been out three days now, and the warders watch
every road and every station, but they've had no sight of him (<font color='blue'><b>Perkins</b></font>) yet. The
farmers about here don't like it, sir, and that's a fact.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Well, I understand that they get five pounds if they can give
information.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Yes, sir, but the chance of five pounds is but a poor thing compared
to the chance of having your throat cut. You see, it isn't like any
ordinary convict. This is a man that would stick at nothing.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Who is he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>), then?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``It is Selden, the Notting Hill murderer.''

 (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div><p/>I remembered the case well, for it was one in which Holmes had taken an
interest on account of the peculiar ferocity of the crime and the
wanton brutality which had marked all the actions of the assassin. The
commutation of his (<font color='blue'><b>assassin</b></font>) death sentence had been due to some doubts as to his (<font color='blue'><b>assassin</b></font>)
complete sanity, so atrocious was his (<font color='blue'><b>assassin</b></font>) conduct. Our wagonette had topped
a rise and in front of us rose the huge expanse of the moor, mottled
with gnarled and craggy cairns and tors. A cold wind swept down from
it and set us shivering. Somewhere there, on that desolate plain, was
lurking this fiendish man, hiding in a burrow like a wild beast, his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>)
heart full of malignancy against the whole race which had cast him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) out.
It needed but this to complete the grim suggestiveness of the barren
waste, the chilling wind, and the darkling sky. Even Baskerville fell
silent and pulled his (<font color='blue'><b>Baskerville</b></font>) overcoat more closely around him (<font color='blue'><b>Baskerville</b></font>).

<p/>We had left the fertile country behind and beneath us. We looked back on
it now, the slanting rays of a low sun turning the streams to threads of
gold and glowing on the red earth new turned by the plough and the broad
tangle of the woodlands. The road in front of us grew bleaker and wilder
over huge russet and olive slopes, sprinkled with giant boulders. Now
and then we passed a moorland cottage, walled and roofed with stone,
with no creeper to break its harsh outline. Suddenly we looked down into
a cuplike depression, patched with stunted oaks and firs which had been
twisted and bent by the fury of years of storm. Two high, narrow towers
rose over the trees. The driver pointed with his (<font color='blue'><b>driver</b></font>) whip.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Baskerville Hall,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>said he (<font color='blue'><b>driver</b></font>).

<p/>Its master had risen and was staring with flushed cheeks and shining
eyes. A few minutes later we had reached the lodge-gates, a maze of
fantastic tracery in wrought iron, with weather-bitten pillars on either
side, blotched with lichens, and surmounted by the boars' heads of the
Baskervilles. The lodge was a ruin of black granite and bared ribs of
rafters, but facing it was a new building, half constructed, the first
fruit of Sir Charles's South African gold.

<p/>Through the gateway we passed into the avenue, where the wheels were
again hushed amid the leaves, and the old trees shot their branches in a
sombre tunnel over our heads. Baskerville shuddered as he (<font color='blue'><b>Baskerville</b></font>) looked up
the long, dark drive to where the house glimmered like a ghost at the
farther end.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Was it here?''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Baskerville</b></font>) asked in a low voice.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``No, no, the yew alley is on the other side.''

 (<font color='red'><b>The heir</b></font>)</div><p/>The young heir glanced round with a gloomy face.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``It's no wonder my uncle felt as if trouble were coming on him (<font color='blue'><b>uncle</b></font>) in such a
place as this,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>said he (<font color='blue'><b>heir</b></font>). <div class="bookquote">``It's enough to scare any man. I'll have a row
of electric lamps up here inside of six months, and you won't know it
again, with a thousand candle-power Swan and Edison right here in front
of the hall door.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/>The avenue opened into a broad expanse of turf, and the house lay before
us. In the fading light I could see that the centre was a heavy block
of building from which a porch projected. The whole front was draped in
ivy, with a patch clipped bare here and there where a window or a coat
of arms broke through the dark veil. From this central block rose the
twin towers, ancient, crenelated, and pierced with many loopholes. To
right and left of the turrets were more modern wings of black granite.
A dull light shone through heavy mullioned windows, and from the high
chimneys which rose from the steep, high-angled roof there sprang a
single black column of smoke.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Welcome, Sir Henry! Welcome to Baskerville Hall!''

 (<font color='red'><b>A man</b></font>)</div><p/>A tall man had stepped from the shadow of the porch to open the door of
the wagonette. The figure of a woman was silhouetted against the yellow
light of the hall. She (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) came out and helped the man to hand down our
bags.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``You don't mind my driving straight home, Sir Henry?''  (<font color='red'><b>Dr. Mortimer/Mortimer/Dr. James Mortimer</b></font>)</div>said Dr. Mortimer.
<div class="bookquote">``My wife is expecting me.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Surely you will stay and have some dinner?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``No, I must go. I shall probably find some work awaiting me. I would
stay to show you over the house, but Barrymore will be a better guide
than I. Good-bye, and never hesitate night or day to send for me if I
can be of service.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Henry/Henry Baskerville/Baskerville</b></font>)</div><p/>The wheels died away down the drive while Sir Henry and I turned
into the hall, and the door clanged heavily behind us. It was a fine
apartment in which we found ourselves, large, lofty, and heavily
raftered with huge baulks of age-blackened oak. In the great
old-fashioned fireplace behind the high iron dogs a log-fire crackled
and snapped. Sir Henry and I held out our hands to it, for we were numb
from our long drive. Then we gazed round us at the high, thin window
of old stained glass, the oak panelling, the stags' heads, the coats
of arms upon the walls, all dim and sombre in the subdued light of the
central lamp.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``It's just as I imagined it,''  (<font color='red'><b>Henry/Henry Baskerville/Baskerville</b></font>)</div>said Sir Henry. <div class="bookquote">``Is it not the very
picture of an old family home? To think that this should be the same
hall in which for five hundred years my people have lived. It strikes me
solemn to think of it.''

 (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div><p/>I saw his (<font color='blue'><b>Henry</b></font>) dark face lit up with a boyish enthusiasm as he (<font color='blue'><b>Henry</b></font>) gazed about
him (<font color='blue'><b>Henry</b></font>). The light beat upon him (<font color='blue'><b>Henry</b></font>) where he (<font color='blue'><b>Henry</b></font>) stood, but long shadows trailed
down the walls and hung like a black canopy above him (<font color='blue'><b>Henry</b></font>). Barrymore had
returned from taking our luggage to our rooms. He (<font color='blue'><b>Henry</b></font>) stood in front of
us now with the subdued manner of a well-trained servant. He (<font color='blue'><b>servant</b></font>) was a
remarkable-looking man, tall, handsome, with a square black beard and
pale, distinguished features.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Would you wish dinner to be served at once, sir?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Is it ready?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``In a very few minutes, sir. You will find hot water in your rooms. My
wife and I will be happy, Sir Henry, to stay with you until you have
made your fresh arrangements, but you will understand that under the new
conditions this house will require a considerable staff.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``What new conditions?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I only meant, sir, that Sir Charles led a very retired life, and we
were able to look after his (<font color='blue'><b>Charles</b></font>) wants. You would, naturally, wish to have
more company, and so you will need changes in your household.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Do you mean that your wife and you wish to leave?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Only when it is quite convenient to you, sir.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``But your family have been with us for several generations, have they
not? I should be sorry to begin my life here by breaking an old family
connection.''

 (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div><p/>I seemed to discern some signs of emotion upon the butler's white face.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``I feel that also, sir, and so does my wife. But to tell the truth, sir,
we were both very much attached to Sir Charles, and his (<font color='blue'><b>Charles</b></font>) death gave us
a shock and made these surroundings very painful to us. I fear that we
shall never again be easy in our minds at Baskerville Hall.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``But what do you intend to do?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I have no doubt, sir, that we shall succeed in establishing ourselves
in some business. Sir Charles's generosity has given us the means to do
so. And now, sir, perhaps I had best show you to your rooms.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/>A square balustraded gallery ran round the top of the old hall,
approached by a double stair. From this central point two long corridors
extended the whole length of the building, from which all the bedrooms
opened. My own was in the same wing as Baskerville's and almost next
door to it. These rooms appeared to be much more modern than the
central part of the house, and the bright paper and numerous candles
did something to remove the sombre impression which our arrival had left
upon my mind.

<p/>But the dining-room which opened out of the hall was a place of shadow
and gloom. It was a long chamber with a step separating the dais where
the family sat from the lower portion reserved for their dependents.
At one end a minstrel's gallery overlooked it. Black beams shot across
above our heads, with a smoke-darkened ceiling beyond them. With rows of
flaring torches to light it up, and the colour and rude hilarity of
an old-time banquet, it might have softened; but now, when two
black-clothed gentlemen sat in the little circle of light thrown by a
shaded lamp, one's voice became hushed and one's spirit subdued. A
dim line of ancestors, in every variety of dress, from the Elizabethan
knight to the buck of the Regency, stared down upon us and daunted us by
their silent company. We talked little, and I for one was glad when the
meal was over and we were able to retire into the modern billiard-room
and smoke a cigarette.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``My word, it isn't a very cheerful place,''  (<font color='red'><b>Henry/Henry Baskerville/Baskerville</b></font>)</div>said Sir Henry. <div class="bookquote">``I suppose
one can tone down to it, but I feel a bit out of the picture at present.
I don't wonder that my uncle got a little jumpy if he (<font color='blue'><b>uncle</b></font>) lived all alone
in such a house as this. However, if it suits you, we will retire early
tonight, and perhaps things may seem more cheerful in the morning.''

 (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div><p/>I drew aside my curtains before I went to bed and looked out from my
window. It opened upon the grassy space which lay in front of the hall
door. Beyond, two copses of trees moaned and swung in a rising wind. A
half moon broke through the rifts of racing clouds. In its cold light I
saw beyond the trees a broken fringe of rocks, and the long, low curve
of the melancholy moor. I closed the curtain, feeling that my last
impression was in keeping with the rest.

<p/>And yet it was not quite the last. I found myself weary and yet wakeful,
tossing restlessly from side to side, seeking for the sleep which would
not come. Far away a chiming clock struck out the quarters of the
hours, but otherwise a deathly silence lay upon the old house. And then
suddenly, in the very dead of the night, there came a sound to my
ears, clear, resonant, and unmistakable. It was the sob of a woman, the
muffled, strangling gasp of one who is torn by an uncontrollable sorrow.
I sat up in bed and listened intently. The noise could not have been
far away and was certainly in the house. For half an hour I waited with
every nerve on the alert, but there came no other sound save the chiming
clock and the rustle of the ivy on the wall.




<p/>Chapter 7. The Stapletons of Merripit House



<p/>The fresh beauty of the following morning did something to efface from
our minds the grim and gray impression which had been left upon both of
us by our first experience of Baskerville Hall. As Sir Henry and I sat
at breakfast the sunlight flooded in through the high mullioned windows,
throwing watery patches of colour from the coats of arms which covered
them. The dark panelling glowed like bronze in the golden rays, and it
was hard to realize that this was indeed the chamber which had struck
such a gloom into our souls upon the evening before.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``I guess it is ourselves and not the house that we have to blame!''  (<font color='red'><b>the baronet</b></font>)</div>said
the baronet. <div class="bookquote">``We were tired with our journey and chilled by our drive,
so we took a gray view of the place. Now we are fresh and well, so it is
all cheerful once more.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``And yet it was not entirely a question of imagination,''  (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div>I answered.
<div class="bookquote">``Did you, for example, happen to hear someone, a woman I think, sobbing
in the night?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``That is curious, for I did when I was half asleep fancy that I heard
something of the sort. I waited quite a time, but there was no more of
it, so I concluded that it was all a dream.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I heard it distinctly, and I am sure that it was really the sob of a
woman.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``We must ask about this right away.''  (<font color='red'><b>He</b></font>)</div>He (<font color='blue'><b>Henry</b></font>) rang the bell and asked
Barrymore whether he (<font color='blue'><b>Henry</b></font>) could account for our experience. It seemed to me
that the pallid features of the butler turned a shade paler still as he (<font color='blue'><b>butler</b></font>)
listened to his (<font color='blue'><b>butler</b></font>) master's question.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``There are only two women in the house, Sir Henry,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>butler</b></font>) answered. <div class="bookquote">``One is
the scullery-maid, who sleeps in the other wing. The other is my wife,
and I can answer for it that the sound could not have come from her (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>).''

 (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div><p/>And yet he (<font color='blue'><b>butler</b></font>) lied as he (<font color='blue'><b>butler</b></font>) said it, for it chanced that after breakfast I met
Mrs. Barrymore in the long corridor with the sun full upon her (<font color='blue'><b>Barrymore</b></font>) face. She (<font color='blue'><b>Barrymore</b></font>)
was a large, impassive, heavy-featured woman with a stern set expression
of mouth. But her (<font color='blue'><b>Barrymore</b></font>) telltale eyes were red and glanced at me from between
swollen lids. It was she (<font color='blue'><b>Barrymore</b></font>), then, who wept in the night, and if she (<font color='blue'><b>Barrymore</b></font>) did so
her (<font color='blue'><b>Barrymore</b></font>) husband must know it. Yet he (<font color='blue'><b>husband</b></font>) had taken the obvious risk of discovery
in declaring that it was not so. Why had he (<font color='blue'><b>husband</b></font>) done this? And why did she (<font color='blue'><b>Barrymore</b></font>)
weep so bitterly? Already round this pale-faced, handsome, black-bearded
man there was gathering an atmosphere of mystery and of gloom. It was he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>)
who had been the first to discover the body of Sir Charles, and we had
only his (<font color='blue'><b>Charles</b></font>) word for all the circumstances which led up to the old man's
death. Was it possible that it was Barrymore, after all, whom we had
seen in the cab in Regent Street? The beard might well have been the
same. The cabman had described a somewhat shorter man, but such an
impression might easily have been erroneous. How could I settle the
point forever? Obviously the first thing to do was to see the Grimpen
postmaster and find whether the test telegram had really been placed in
Barrymore's own hands. Be the answer what it might, I should at least
have something to report to Sherlock Holmes.

<p/>Sir Henry had numerous papers to examine after breakfast, so that the
time was propitious for my excursion. It was a pleasant walk of four
miles along the edge of the moor, leading me at last to a small gray
hamlet, in which two larger buildings, which proved to be the inn and
the house of Dr. Mortimer, stood high above the rest. The postmaster,
who was also the village grocer, had a clear recollection of the
telegram.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Certainly, sir,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>said he (<font color='blue'><b>postmaster</b></font>), <div class="bookquote">``I had the telegram delivered to Mr.
Barrymore exactly as directed.''

 (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Who delivered it?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``My boy here. James, you delivered that telegram to Mr. Barrymore at the
Hall last week, did you not?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Yes, father, I delivered it.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Into his (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) own hands?''  (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div>I asked.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Well, he (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) was up in the loft at the time, so that I could not put it
into his (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) own hands, but I gave it into Mrs. Barrymore's hands, and she (<font color='blue'><b>Barrymore</b></font>)
promised to deliver it at once.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Did you see Mr. Barrymore?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``No, sir; I tell you he (<font color='blue'><b>Barrymore</b></font>) was in the loft.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``If you didn't see him (<font color='blue'><b>Barrymore</b></font>), how do you know he (<font color='blue'><b>Barrymore</b></font>) was in the loft?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Well, surely his (<font color='blue'><b>Barrymore</b></font>) own wife ought to know where he (<font color='blue'><b>Barrymore</b></font>) is,''  (<font color='red'><b>the postmaster</b></font>)</div>said the
postmaster testily. <div class="bookquote">``Didn't he (<font color='blue'><b>Barrymore</b></font>) get the telegram? If there is any mistake
it is for Mr. Barrymore himself to complain.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Holmes/Mr. Holmes/Sherlock Holmes</b></font>)</div><p/>It seemed hopeless to pursue the inquiry any farther, but it was clear
that in spite of Holmes's ruse we had no proof that Barrymore had not
been in London all the time. Suppose that it were so--suppose that the
same man had been the last who had seen Sir Charles alive, and the first
to dog the new heir when he (<font color='blue'><b>Charles</b></font>) returned to England. What then? Was he (<font color='blue'><b>Charles</b></font>) the
agent of others or had he (<font color='blue'><b>Charles</b></font>) some sinister design of his (<font color='blue'><b>Charles</b></font>) own? What interest
could he (<font color='blue'><b>Charles</b></font>) have in persecuting the Baskerville family? I thought of the
strange warning clipped out of the leading article of the Times. Was
that his (<font color='blue'><b>Charles</b></font>) work or was it possibly the doing of someone who was bent upon
counteracting his (<font color='blue'><b>Charles</b></font>) schemes? The only conceivable motive was that which
had been suggested by Sir Henry, that if the family could be scared away
a comfortable and permanent home would be secured for the Barrymores.
But surely such an explanation as that would be quite inadequate to
account for the deep and subtle scheming which seemed to be weaving an
invisible net round the young baronet. Holmes himself had said that
no more complex case had come to him (<font color='blue'><b>Holmes</b></font>) in all the long series of his (<font color='blue'><b>Holmes</b></font>)
sensational investigations. I prayed, as I walked back along the gray,
lonely road, that my friend might soon be freed from his (<font color='blue'><b>friend</b></font>) preoccupations
and able to come down to take this heavy burden of responsibility from
my shoulders.

<p/>Suddenly my thoughts were interrupted by the sound of running feet
behind me and by a voice which called me by name. I turned, expecting to
see Dr. Mortimer, but to my surprise it was a stranger who was pursuing
me. He (<font color='blue'><b>stranger</b></font>) was a small, slim, clean-shaven, prim-faced man, flaxen-haired
and leanjawed, between thirty and forty years of age, dressed in a gray
suit and wearing a straw hat. A tin box for botanical specimens hung
over his (<font color='blue'><b>stranger</b></font>) shoulder and he (<font color='blue'><b>stranger</b></font>) carried a green butterfly-net in one of his (<font color='blue'><b>stranger</b></font>)
hands.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``You will, I am sure, excuse my presumption, Dr. Watson,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>said he (<font color='blue'><b>stranger</b></font>) as he (<font color='blue'><b>stranger</b></font>)
came panting up to where I stood. <div class="bookquote">``Here on the moor we are homely folk
and do not wait for formal introductions. You may possibly have heard
my name from our mutual friend, Mortimer. I am Stapleton, of Merripit
House.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Your net and box would have told me as much,''  (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div>said I, <div class="bookquote">``for I knew that
Mr. Stapleton was a naturalist. But how did you know me?''

 (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I have been calling on Mortimer, and he (<font color='blue'><b>Mortimer</b></font>) pointed you out to me from
the window of his (<font color='blue'><b>Mortimer</b></font>) surgery as you passed. As our road lay the same way I
thought that I would overtake you and introduce myself. I trust that Sir
Henry is none the worse for his (<font color='blue'><b>Henry</b></font>) journey?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``He (<font color='blue'><b>Henry</b></font>) is very well, thank you.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``We were all rather afraid that after the sad death of Sir Charles the
new baronet might refuse to live here. It is asking much of a wealthy
man to come down and bury himself in a place of this kind, but I need
not tell you that it means a very great deal to the countryside. Sir
Henry has, I suppose, no superstitious fears in the matter?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I do not think that it is likely.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Of course you know the legend of the fiend dog which haunts the
family?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I have heard it.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``It is extraordinary how credulous the peasants are about here! Any
number of them are ready to swear that they have seen such a creature
upon the moor.''  (<font color='red'><b>He</b></font>)</div>He (<font color='blue'><b>stranger</b></font>) spoke with a smile, but I seemed to read in his (<font color='blue'><b>stranger</b></font>) eyes
that he (<font color='blue'><b>stranger</b></font>) took the matter more seriously. <div class="bookquote">``The story took a great hold
upon the imagination of Sir Charles, and I have no doubt that it led to
his (<font color='blue'><b>Charles</b></font>) tragic end.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``But how?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``His (<font color='blue'><b>Charles</b></font>) nerves were so worked up that the appearance of any dog might have
had a fatal effect upon his (<font color='blue'><b>Charles</b></font>) diseased heart. I fancy that he (<font color='blue'><b>Charles</b></font>) really
did see something of the kind upon that last night in the yew alley. I
feared that some disaster might occur, for I was very fond of the old
man, and I knew that his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) heart was weak.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``How did you know that?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``My friend Mortimer told me.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``You think, then, that some dog pursued Sir Charles, and that he (<font color='blue'><b>Charles</b></font>) died of
fright in consequence?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Have you any better explanation?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I have not come to any conclusion.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Has Mr. Sherlock Holmes?''

 (<font color='red'><b>companion</b></font>)</div><p/>The words took away my breath for an instant but a glance at the placid
face and steadfast eyes of my companion showed that no surprise was
intended.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``It is useless for us to pretend that we do not know you, Dr. Watson,''
 (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>said he (<font color='blue'><b>companion</b></font>). <div class="bookquote">``The records of your detective have reached us here, and you
could not celebrate him (<font color='blue'><b>Watson</b></font>) without being known yourself. When Mortimer told
me your name he (<font color='blue'><b>Mortimer</b></font>) could not deny your identity. If you are here, then it
follows that Mr. Sherlock Holmes is interesting himself in the matter,
and I am naturally curious to know what view he (<font color='blue'><b>Holmes</b></font>) may take.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I am afraid that I cannot answer that question.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``May I ask if he (<font color='blue'><b>Holmes</b></font>) is going to honour us with a visit himself?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``He (<font color='blue'><b>Holmes</b></font>) cannot leave town at present. He (<font color='blue'><b>Holmes</b></font>) has other cases which engage his (<font color='blue'><b>Holmes</b></font>)
attention.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``What a pity! He (<font color='blue'><b>Holmes</b></font>) might throw some light on that which is so dark to us.
But as to your own researches, if there is any possible way in which I
can be of service to you I trust that you will command me. If I had
any indication of the nature of your suspicions or how you propose to
investigate the case, I might perhaps even now give you some aid or
advice.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I assure you that I am simply here upon a visit to my friend, Sir
Henry, and that I need no help of any kind.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Excellent!''  (<font color='red'><b>Stapleton/Mr. Stapleton</b></font>)</div>said Stapleton. <div class="bookquote">``You are perfectly right to be wary and
discreet. I am justly reproved for what I feel was an unjustifiable
intrusion, and I promise you that I will not mention the matter again.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/>We had come to a point where a narrow grassy path struck off from the
road and wound away across the moor. A steep, boulder-sprinkled hill lay
upon the right which had in bygone days been cut into a granite quarry.
The face which was turned towards us formed a dark cliff, with ferns and
brambles growing in its niches. From over a distant rise there floated a
gray plume of smoke.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``A moderate walk along this moor-path brings us to Merripit House,''
 (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>said he (<font color='blue'><b>Stapleton</b></font>). <div class="bookquote">``Perhaps you will spare an hour that I may have the pleasure of
introducing you to my sister.''

 (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div><p/>My first thought was that I should be by Sir Henry's side. But then I
remembered the pile of papers and bills with which his (<font color='blue'><b>Henry</b></font>) study table was
littered. It was certain that I could not help with those. And Holmes
had expressly said that I should study the neighbours upon the moor. I
accepted Stapleton's invitation, and we turned together down the path.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``It is a wonderful place, the moor,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>said he (<font color='blue'><b>Stapleton</b></font>), looking round over the
undulating downs, long green rollers, with crests of jagged granite
foaming up into fantastic surges. <div class="bookquote">``You never tire of the moor. You
cannot think the wonderful secrets which it contains. It is so vast, and
so barren, and so mysterious.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``You know it well, then?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I have only been here two years. The residents would call me a
newcomer. We came shortly after Sir Charles settled. But my tastes led
me to explore every part of the country round, and I should think that
there are few men who know it better than I do.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Is it hard to know?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Very hard. You see, for example, this great plain to the north here
with the queer hills breaking out of it. Do you observe anything
remarkable about that?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``It would be a rare place for a gallop.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``You would naturally think so and the thought has cost several their
lives before now. You notice those bright green spots scattered thickly
over it?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Yes, they seem more fertile than the rest.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Stapleton/Mr. Stapleton</b></font>)</div><p/>Stapleton laughed. <div class="bookquote">``That is the great Grimpen Mire,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>said he (<font color='blue'><b>Stapleton</b></font>). <div class="bookquote">``A false
step yonder means death to man or beast. Only yesterday I saw one of the
moor ponies wander into it. He (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) never came out. I saw his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) head for quite
a long time craning out of the bog-hole, but it sucked him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) down at last.
Even in dry seasons it is a danger to cross it, but after these autumn
rains it is an awful place. And yet I can find my way to the very heart
of it and return alive. By George, there is another of those miserable
ponies!''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/>Something brown was rolling and tossing among the green sedges. Then a
long, agonized, writhing neck shot upward and a dreadful cry echoed
over the moor. It turned me cold with horror, but my companion's nerves
seemed to be stronger than mine.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``It's gone!''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>said he (<font color='blue'><b>companion</b></font>). <div class="bookquote">``The mire has him (<font color='blue'><b>George</b></font>). Two in two days, and many more,
perhaps, for they get in the way of going there in the dry weather and
never know the difference until the mire has them in its clutches. It's
a bad place, the great Grimpen Mire.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``And you say you can penetrate it?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Yes, there are one or two paths which a very active man can take. I
have found them out.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``But why should you wish to go into so horrible a place?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Well, you see the hills beyond? They are really islands cut off on all
sides by the impassable mire, which has crawled round them in the course
of years. That is where the rare plants and the butterflies are, if you
have the wit to reach them.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I shall try my luck some day.''

 (<font color='red'><b>He</b></font>)</div><p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>companion</b></font>) looked at me with a surprised face. <div class="bookquote">``For God's sake put such an idea
out of your mind,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>said he (<font color='blue'><b>companion</b></font>). <div class="bookquote">``Your blood would be upon my head. I assure
you that there would not be the least chance of your coming back alive.
It is only by remembering certain complex landmarks that I am able to do
it.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Halloa!''  (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div>I cried. <div class="bookquote">``What is that?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/>A long, low moan, indescribably sad, swept over the moor. It filled the
whole air, and yet it was impossible to say whence it came. From a
dull murmur it swelled into a deep roar, and then sank back into a
melancholy, throbbing murmur once again. Stapleton looked at me with a
curious expression in his (<font color='blue'><b>Stapleton</b></font>) face.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Queer place, the moor!''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>said he (<font color='blue'><b>Stapleton</b></font>).

<p/><div class="bookquote">``But what is it?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``The peasants say it is the Hound of the Baskervilles calling for its
prey. I've heard it once or twice before, but never quite so loud.''

 (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div><p/>I looked round, with a chill of fear in my heart, at the huge swelling
plain, mottled with the green patches of rushes. Nothing stirred over
the vast expanse save a pair of ravens, which croaked loudly from a tor
behind us.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``You are an educated man. You don't believe such nonsense as that?''  (<font color='red'><b>I.</b></font>)</div>said
I. <div class="bookquote">``What do you think is the cause of so strange a sound?''

 (<font color='red'><b>I.</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Bogs make queer noises sometimes. It's the mud settling, or the water
rising, or something.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``No, no, that was a living voice.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Well, perhaps it was. Did you ever hear a bittern booming?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``No, I never did.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``It's a very rare bird--practically extinct--in England now, but all
things are possible upon the moor. Yes, I should not be surprised to
learn that what we have heard is the cry of the last of the bitterns.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``It's the weirdest, strangest thing that ever I heard in my life.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Yes, it's rather an uncanny place altogether. Look at the hillside
yonder. What do you make of those?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/>The whole steep slope was covered with gray circular rings of stone, a
score of them at least.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``What are they? Sheep-pens?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/>``No, they are the homes of our worthy ancestors. Prehistoric man lived
thickly on the moor, and as no one in particular has lived there since,
we find all his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) little arrangements exactly as he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) left them. These are
his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) wigwams with the roofs off. You can even see his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) hearth and his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>)
couch if you have the curiosity to go inside.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``But it is quite a town. When was it inhabited?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Neolithic man--no date.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``What did he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) do?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``He (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) grazed his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) cattle on these slopes, and he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) learned to dig for tin
when the bronze sword began to supersede the stone axe. Look at the
great trench in the opposite hill. That is his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) mark. Yes, you will find
some very singular points about the moor, Dr. Watson. Oh, excuse me an
instant! It is surely Cyclopides.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Stapleton/Mr. Stapleton</b></font>)</div><p/>A small fly or moth had fluttered across our path, and in an instant
Stapleton was rushing with extraordinary energy and speed in pursuit of
it. To my dismay the creature flew straight for the great mire, and my
acquaintance never paused for an instant, bounding from tuft to tuft
behind it, his (<font color='blue'><b>acquaintance</b></font>) green net waving in the air. His (<font color='blue'><b>acquaintance</b></font>) gray clothes and jerky,
zigzag, irregular progress made him (<font color='blue'><b>acquaintance</b></font>) not unlike some huge moth himself.
I was standing watching his (<font color='blue'><b>acquaintance</b></font>) pursuit with a mixture of admiration for his (<font color='blue'><b>acquaintance</b></font>)
extraordinary activity and fear lest he (<font color='blue'><b>acquaintance</b></font>) should lose his (<font color='blue'><b>acquaintance</b></font>) footing in the
treacherous mire, when I heard the sound of steps and, turning round,
found a woman near me upon the path. She (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) had come from the direction in
which the plume of smoke indicated the position of Merripit House, but
the dip of the moor had hid her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) until she (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) was quite close.

<p/>I could not doubt that this was the Miss Stapleton of whom I had
been told, since ladies of any sort must be few upon the moor, and I
remembered that I had heard someone describe her (<font color='blue'><b>Stapleton</b></font>) as being a beauty. The
woman who approached me was certainly that, and of a most uncommon type.
There could not have been a greater contrast between brother and sister,
for Stapleton was neutral tinted, with light hair and gray eyes, while
she (<font color='blue'><b>sister</b></font>) was darker than any brunette whom I have seen in England--slim,
elegant, and tall. She (<font color='blue'><b>sister</b></font>) had a proud, finely cut face, so regular that it
might have seemed impassive were it not for the sensitive mouth and the
beautiful dark, eager eyes. With her (<font color='blue'><b>sister</b></font>) perfect figure and elegant dress
she (<font color='blue'><b>sister</b></font>) was, indeed, a strange apparition upon a lonely moorland path. Her (<font color='blue'><b>sister</b></font>)
eyes were on her (<font color='blue'><b>sister</b></font>) brother as I turned, and then she (<font color='blue'><b>sister</b></font>) quickened her (<font color='blue'><b>sister</b></font>) pace
towards me. I had raised my hat and was about to make some explanatory
remark when her (<font color='blue'><b>sister</b></font>) own words turned all my thoughts into a new channel.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Go back!''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>sister</b></font>) said. <div class="bookquote">``Go straight back to London, instantly.''

 (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div><p/>I could only stare at her (<font color='blue'><b>sister</b></font>) in stupid surprise. Her (<font color='blue'><b>sister</b></font>) eyes blazed at me, and
she (<font color='blue'><b>sister</b></font>) tapped the ground impatiently with her (<font color='blue'><b>sister</b></font>) foot.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Why should I go back?''  (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div>I asked.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``I cannot explain.''  (<font color='red'><b>She</b></font>)</div>She (<font color='blue'><b>sister</b></font>) spoke in a low, eager voice, with a curious lisp
in her (<font color='blue'><b>sister</b></font>) utterance. <div class="bookquote">``But for God's sake do what I ask you. Go back and
never set foot upon the moor again.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``But I have only just come.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Man, man!''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>sister</b></font>) cried. <div class="bookquote">``Can you not tell when a warning is for your own
good? Go back to London! Start tonight! Get away from this place at all
costs! Hush, my brother is coming! Not a word of what I have said. Would
you mind getting that orchid for me among the mare's-tails yonder? We
are very rich in orchids on the moor, though, of course, you are rather
late to see the beauties of the place.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Stapleton/Mr. Stapleton</b></font>)</div><p/>Stapleton had abandoned the chase and came back to us breathing hard and
flushed with his (<font color='blue'><b>Stapleton</b></font>) exertions.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Halloa, Beryl!''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>said he (<font color='blue'><b>Stapleton</b></font>), and it seemed to me that the tone of his (<font color='blue'><b>Stapleton</b></font>)
greeting was not altogether a cordial one.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Well, Jack, you are very hot.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Yes, I was chasing a Cyclopides. He (<font color='blue'><b>Jack</b></font>) is very rare and seldom found in
the late autumn. What a pity that I should have missed him (<font color='blue'><b>Jack</b></font>)!''  (<font color='red'><b>He</b></font>)</div>He (<font color='blue'><b>Stapleton</b></font>) spoke
unconcernedly, but his (<font color='blue'><b>Stapleton</b></font>) small light eyes glanced incessantly from the
girl to me.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``You have introduced yourselves, I can see.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Yes. I was telling Sir Henry that it was rather late for him (<font color='blue'><b>Henry</b></font>) to see the
true beauties of the moor.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Why, who do you think this is?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I imagine that it must be Sir Henry Baskerville.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``No, no,''  (<font color='red'><b>I.</b></font>)</div>said I. <div class="bookquote">``Only a humble commoner, but his (<font color='blue'><b>Baskerville</b></font>) friend. My name is
Dr. Watson.''

 (<font color='red'><b>I.</b></font>)</div><p/>A flush of vexation passed over her (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) expressive face. <div class="bookquote">``We have been
talking at cross purposes,''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>said she (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>).

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Why, you had not very much time for talk,''  (<font color='red'><b>brother</b></font>)</div>her (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) brother remarked with
the same questioning eyes.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``I talked as if Dr. Watson were a resident instead of being merely a
visitor,''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>said she (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>). <div class="bookquote">``It cannot much matter to him (<font color='blue'><b>Watson</b></font>) whether it is early
or late for the orchids. But you will come on, will you not, and see
Merripit House?''

 (<font color='red'><b>some grazier</b></font>)</div><p/>A short walk brought us to it, a bleak moorland house, once the farm
of some grazier in the old prosperous days, but now put into repair and
turned into a modern dwelling. An orchard surrounded it, but the trees,
as is usual upon the moor, were stunted and nipped, and the effect of
the whole place was mean and melancholy. We were admitted by a strange,
wizened, rusty-coated old manservant, who seemed in keeping with
the house. Inside, however, there were large rooms furnished with an
elegance in which I seemed to recognize the taste of the lady. As I
looked from their windows at the interminable granite-flecked moor
rolling unbroken to the farthest horizon I could not but marvel at what
could have brought this highly educated man and this beautiful woman to
live in such a place.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Queer spot to choose, is it not?''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>said he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) as if in answer to my
thought. <div class="bookquote">``And yet we manage to make ourselves fairly happy, do we not,
Beryl?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Quite happy,''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>said she (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>), but there was no ring of conviction in her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>)
words.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``I had a school,''  (<font color='red'><b>Stapleton/Mr. Stapleton</b></font>)</div>said Stapleton. <div class="bookquote">``It was in the north country. The work
to a man of my temperament was mechanical and uninteresting, but the
privilege of living with youth, of helping to mould those young minds,
and of impressing them with one's own character and ideals was very dear
to me. However, the fates were against us. A serious epidemic broke out
in the school and three of the boys died. It never recovered from the
blow, and much of my capital was irretrievably swallowed up. And yet,
if it were not for the loss of the charming companionship of the boys,
I could rejoice over my own misfortune, for, with my strong tastes
for botany and zoology, I find an unlimited field of work here, and my
sister is as devoted to Nature as I am. All this, Dr. Watson, has been
brought upon your head by your expression as you surveyed the moor out
of our window.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``It certainly did cross my mind that it might be a little dull--less for
you, perhaps, than for your sister.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``No, no, I am never dull,''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>said she (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) quickly.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``We have books, we have our studies, and we have interesting neighbours.
Dr. Mortimer is a most learned man in his (<font color='blue'><b>Mortimer</b></font>) own line. Poor Sir Charles was
also an admirable companion. We knew him (<font color='blue'><b>Charles</b></font>) well and miss him (<font color='blue'><b>Charles</b></font>) more than
I can tell. Do you think that I should intrude if I were to call this
afternoon and make the acquaintance of Sir Henry?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I am sure that he (<font color='blue'><b>Henry</b></font>) would be delighted.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Then perhaps you would mention that I propose to do so. We may in
our humble way do something to make things more easy for him (<font color='blue'><b>Henry</b></font>) until he (<font color='blue'><b>Henry</b></font>)
becomes accustomed to his (<font color='blue'><b>Henry</b></font>) new surroundings. Will you come upstairs, Dr.
Watson, and inspect my collection of Lepidoptera? I think it is the most
complete one in the south-west of England. By the time that you have
looked through them lunch will be almost ready.''

 (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div><p/>But I was eager to get back to my charge. The melancholy of the moor,
the death of the unfortunate pony, the weird sound which had been
associated with the grim legend of the Baskervilles, all these things
tinged my thoughts with sadness. Then on the top of these more or less
vague impressions there had come the definite and distinct warning of
Miss Stapleton, delivered with such intense earnestness that I could
not doubt that some grave and deep reason lay behind it. I resisted
all pressure to stay for lunch, and I set off at once upon my return
journey, taking the grass-grown path by which we had come.

<p/>It seems, however, that there must have been some short cut for those
who knew it, for before I had reached the road I was astounded to see
Miss Stapleton sitting upon a rock by the side of the track. Her (<font color='blue'><b>Stapleton</b></font>) face
was beautifully flushed with her (<font color='blue'><b>Stapleton</b></font>) exertions and she (<font color='blue'><b>Stapleton</b></font>) held her (<font color='blue'><b>Stapleton</b></font>) hand to her (<font color='blue'><b>Stapleton</b></font>)
side.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``I have run all the way in order to cut you off, Dr. Watson,''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>said she (<font color='blue'><b>Stapleton</b></font>).
<div class="bookquote">``I had not even time to put on my hat. I must not stop, or my brother
may miss me. I wanted to say to you how sorry I am about the stupid
mistake I made in thinking that you were Sir Henry. Please forget the
words I said, which have no application whatever to you.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``But I can't forget them, Miss Stapleton,''  (<font color='red'><b>I.</b></font>)</div>said I. <div class="bookquote">``I am Sir Henry's
friend, and his (<font color='blue'><b>Henry</b></font>) welfare is a very close concern of mine. Tell me why it
was that you were so eager that Sir Henry should return to London.''

 (<font color='red'><b>I.</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``A woman's whim, Dr. Watson. When you know me better you will understand
that I cannot always give reasons for what I say or do.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``No, no. I remember the thrill in your voice. I remember the look in
your eyes. Please, please, be frank with me, Miss Stapleton, for ever
since I have been here I have been conscious of shadows all round me.
Life has become like that great Grimpen Mire, with little green patches
everywhere into which one may sink and with no guide to point the track.
Tell me then what it was that you meant, and I will promise to convey
your warning to Sir Henry.''

 (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div><p/>An expression of irresolution passed for an instant over her (<font color='blue'><b>Stapleton</b></font>) face, but
her (<font color='blue'><b>Stapleton</b></font>) eyes had hardened again when she (<font color='blue'><b>Stapleton</b></font>) answered me.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``You make too much of it, Dr. Watson,''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>said she (<font color='blue'><b>Stapleton</b></font>). ``My brother and I
were very much shocked by the death of Sir Charles. We knew him (<font color='blue'><b>Charles</b></font>) very
intimately, for his (<font color='blue'><b>Charles</b></font>) favourite walk was over the moor to our house. He (<font color='blue'><b>Charles</b></font>)
was deeply impressed with the curse which hung over the family, and when
this tragedy came I naturally felt that there must be some grounds
for the fears which he (<font color='blue'><b>Charles</b></font>) had expressed. I was distressed therefore when
another member of the family came down to live here, and I felt that he (<font color='blue'><b>member</b></font>)
should be warned of the danger which he (<font color='blue'><b>member</b></font>) will run. That was all which I
intended to convey.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``But what is the danger?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``You know the story of the hound?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I do not believe in such nonsense.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``But I do. If you have any influence with Sir Henry, take him (<font color='blue'><b>Henry</b></font>) away from
a place which has always been fatal to his (<font color='blue'><b>Henry</b></font>) family. The world is wide.
Why should he (<font color='blue'><b>Henry</b></font>) wish to live at the place of danger?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Because it is the place of danger. That is Sir Henry's nature. I fear
that unless you can give me some more definite information than this it
would be impossible to get him (<font color='blue'><b>Henry</b></font>) to move.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I cannot say anything definite, for I do not know anything definite.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I would ask you one more question, Miss Stapleton. If you meant no
more than this when you first spoke to me, why should you not wish your
brother to overhear what you said? There is nothing to which he (<font color='blue'><b>brother</b></font>), or
anyone else, could object.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``My brother is very anxious to have the Hall inhabited, for he (<font color='blue'><b>brother</b></font>) thinks it
is for the good of the poor folk upon the moor. He (<font color='blue'><b>brother</b></font>) would be very angry
if he (<font color='blue'><b>brother</b></font>) knew that I have said anything which might induce Sir Henry to
go away. But I have done my duty now and I will say no more. I must go
back, or he (<font color='blue'><b>Henry</b></font>) will miss me and suspect that I have seen you. Good-bye!''
 (<font color='red'><b>She</b></font>)</div>She (<font color='blue'><b>Stapleton</b></font>) turned and had disappeared in a few minutes among the scattered
boulders, while I, with my soul full of vague fears, pursued my way to
Baskerville Hall.




<p/>Chapter 8. First Report of Dr. Watson



<p/>From this point onward I will follow the course of events by
transcribing my own letters to Mr. Sherlock Holmes which lie before me
on the table. One page is missing, but otherwise they are exactly
as written and show my feelings and suspicions of the moment more
accurately than my memory, clear as it is upon these tragic events, can
possibly do.


<p/>Baskerville Hall, October 13th. MY DEAR HOLMES: My previous letters
and telegrams have kept you pretty well up to date as to all that has
occurred in this most God-forsaken corner of the world. The longer one
stays here the more does the spirit of the moor sink into one's soul,
its vastness, and also its grim charm. When you are once out upon its
bosom you have left all traces of modern England behind you, but, on the
other hand, you are conscious everywhere of the homes and the work of
the prehistoric people. On all sides of you as you walk are the houses
of these forgotten folk, with their graves and the huge monoliths which
are supposed to have marked their temples. As you look at their gray
stone huts against the scarred hillsides you leave your own age behind
you, and if you were to see a skin-clad, hairy man crawl out from the
low door fitting a flint-tipped arrow on to the string of his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) bow, you
would feel that his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) presence there was more natural than your own. The
strange thing is that they should have lived so thickly on what must
always have been most unfruitful soil. I am no antiquarian, but I could
imagine that they were some unwarlike and harried race who were forced
to accept that which none other would occupy.

<p/>All this, however, is foreign to the mission on which you sent me and
will probably be very uninteresting to your severely practical mind.
I can still remember your complete indifference as to whether the sun
moved round the earth or the earth round the sun. Let me, therefore,
return to the facts concerning Sir Henry Baskerville.

<p/>If you have not had any report within the last few days it is because
up to today there was nothing of importance to relate. Then a very
surprising circumstance occurred, which I shall tell you in due course.
But, first of all, I must keep you in touch with some of the other
factors in the situation.

<p/>One of these, concerning which I have said little, is the escaped
convict upon the moor. There is strong reason now to believe that he (<font color='blue'><b>Baskerville</b></font>)
has got right away, which is a considerable relief to the lonely
householders of this district. A fortnight has passed since his (<font color='blue'><b>Baskerville</b></font>) flight,
during which he (<font color='blue'><b>Baskerville</b></font>) has not been seen and nothing has been heard of him (<font color='blue'><b>Baskerville</b></font>). It
is surely inconceivable that he (<font color='blue'><b>Baskerville</b></font>) could have held out upon the moor during
all that time. Of course, so far as his (<font color='blue'><b>Baskerville</b></font>) concealment goes there is
no difficulty at all. Any one of these stone huts would give him (<font color='blue'><b>Baskerville</b></font>) a
hiding-place. But there is nothing to eat unless he (<font color='blue'><b>Baskerville</b></font>) were to catch and
slaughter one of the moor sheep. We think, therefore, that he (<font color='blue'><b>Baskerville</b></font>) has gone,
and the outlying farmers sleep the better in consequence.

<p/>We are four able-bodied men in this household, so that we could take
good care of ourselves, but I confess that I have had uneasy moments
when I have thought of the Stapletons. They live miles from any help.
There are one maid, an old manservant, the sister, and the brother, the
latter not a very strong man. They would be helpless in the hands of a
desperate fellow like this Notting Hill criminal if he (<font color='blue'><b>fellow</b></font>) could once effect
an entrance. Both Sir Henry and I were concerned at their situation, and
it was suggested that Perkins the groom should go over to sleep there,
but Stapleton would not hear of it.

<p/>The fact is that our friend, the baronet, begins to display a
considerable interest in our fair neighbour. It is not to be wondered
at, for time hangs heavily in this lonely spot to an active man like
him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>), and she (<font color='blue'><b>their</b></font>) is a very fascinating and beautiful woman. There is
something tropical and exotic about her (<font color='blue'><b>their</b></font>) which forms a singular contrast
to her (<font color='blue'><b>their</b></font>) cool and unemotional brother. Yet he (<font color='blue'><b>brother</b></font>) also gives the idea of
hidden fires. He (<font color='blue'><b>brother</b></font>) has certainly a very marked influence over her (<font color='blue'><b>their</b></font>), for
I have seen her (<font color='blue'><b>their</b></font>) continually glance at him (<font color='blue'><b>brother</b></font>) as she (<font color='blue'><b>their</b></font>) talked as if seeking
approbation for what she (<font color='blue'><b>their</b></font>) said. I trust that he (<font color='blue'><b>brother</b></font>) is kind to her (<font color='blue'><b>their</b></font>). There is
a dry glitter in his (<font color='blue'><b>brother</b></font>) eyes and a firm set of his (<font color='blue'><b>brother</b></font>) thin lips, which goes
with a positive and possibly a harsh nature. You would find him (<font color='blue'><b>brother</b></font>) an
interesting study.

<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>brother</b></font>) came over to call upon Baskerville on that first day, and the very
next morning he (<font color='blue'><b>brother</b></font>) took us both to show us the spot where the legend of the
wicked Hugo is supposed to have had its origin. It was an excursion of
some miles across the moor to a place which is so dismal that it might
have suggested the story. We found a short valley between rugged tors
which led to an open, grassy space flecked over with the white cotton
grass. In the middle of it rose two great stones, worn and sharpened at
the upper end until they looked like the huge corroding fangs of some
monstrous beast. In every way it corresponded with the scene of the old
tragedy. Sir Henry was much interested and asked Stapleton more
than once whether he (<font color='blue'><b>Henry</b></font>) did really believe in the possibility of the
interference of the supernatural in the affairs of men. He (<font color='blue'><b>Henry</b></font>) spoke
lightly, but it was evident that he (<font color='blue'><b>Henry</b></font>) was very much in earnest. Stapleton
was guarded in his (<font color='blue'><b>Stapleton</b></font>) replies, but it was easy to see that he (<font color='blue'><b>Stapleton</b></font>) said less
than he (<font color='blue'><b>Stapleton</b></font>) might, and that he (<font color='blue'><b>Stapleton</b></font>) would not express his (<font color='blue'><b>Stapleton</b></font>) whole opinion out of
consideration for the feelings of the baronet. He (<font color='blue'><b>Stapleton</b></font>) told us of similar
cases, where families had suffered from some evil influence, and he (<font color='blue'><b>Stapleton</b></font>) left
us with the impression that he (<font color='blue'><b>Stapleton</b></font>) shared the popular view upon the matter.

<p/>On our way back we stayed for lunch at Merripit House, and it was there
that Sir Henry made the acquaintance of Miss Stapleton. From the first
moment that he (<font color='blue'><b>Henry</b></font>) saw her (<font color='blue'><b>Stapleton</b></font>) he (<font color='blue'><b>Henry</b></font>) appeared to be strongly attracted by her (<font color='blue'><b>Stapleton</b></font>), and
I am much mistaken if the feeling was not mutual. He (<font color='blue'><b>Henry</b></font>) referred to her (<font color='blue'><b>Stapleton</b></font>)
again and again on our walk home, and since then hardly a day has passed
that we have not seen something of the brother and sister. They dine
here tonight, and there is some talk of our going to them next week. One
would imagine that such a match would be very welcome to Stapleton, and
yet I have more than once caught a look of the strongest disapprobation
in his (<font color='blue'><b>Stapleton</b></font>) face when Sir Henry has been paying some attention to his (<font color='blue'><b>Henry</b></font>) sister.
He (<font color='blue'><b>Henry</b></font>) is much attached to her (<font color='blue'><b>sister</b></font>), no doubt, and would lead a lonely life
without her (<font color='blue'><b>sister</b></font>), but it would seem the height of selfishness if he (<font color='blue'><b>Henry</b></font>) were to
stand in the way of her (<font color='blue'><b>sister</b></font>) making so brilliant a marriage. Yet I am certain
that he (<font color='blue'><b>Henry</b></font>) does not wish their intimacy to ripen into love, and I have
several times observed that he (<font color='blue'><b>Henry</b></font>) has taken pains to prevent them from
being tete-a-tete. By the way, your instructions to me never to allow
Sir Henry to go out alone will become very much more onerous if a love
affair were to be added to our other difficulties. My popularity would
soon suffer if I were to carry out your orders to the letter.

<p/>The other day--Thursday, to be more exact--Dr. Mortimer lunched with us.
He (<font color='blue'><b>Mortimer</b></font>) has been excavating a barrow at Long Down and has got a prehistoric
skull which fills him (<font color='blue'><b>Mortimer</b></font>) with great joy. Never was there such a
single-minded enthusiast as he (<font color='blue'><b>enthusiast</b></font>)! The Stapletons came in afterwards, and
the good doctor took us all to the yew alley at Sir Henry's request to
show us exactly how everything occurred upon that fatal night. It is
a long, dismal walk, the yew alley, between two high walls of clipped
hedge, with a narrow band of grass upon either side. At the far end is
an old tumble-down summer-house. Halfway down is the moor-gate, where
the old gentleman left his (<font color='blue'><b>gentleman</b></font>) cigar-ash. It is a white wooden gate with
a latch. Beyond it lies the wide moor. I remembered your theory of the
affair and tried to picture all that had occurred. As the old man stood
there he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) saw something coming across the moor, something which terrified
him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) so that he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) lost his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) wits and ran and ran until he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) died of sheer
horror and exhaustion. There was the long, gloomy tunnel down which
he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) fled. And from what? A sheep-dog of the moor? Or a spectral hound,
black, silent, and monstrous? Was there a human agency in the matter?
Did the pale, watchful Barrymore know more than he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) cared to say? It was
all dim and vague, but always there is the dark shadow of crime behind
it.

<p/>One other neighbour I have met since I wrote last. This is Mr.
Frankland, of Lafter Hall, who lives some four miles to the south of us.
He (<font color='blue'><b>Frankland</b></font>) is an elderly man, red-faced, white-haired, and choleric. His (<font color='blue'><b>Frankland</b></font>) passion
is for the British law, and he (<font color='blue'><b>Frankland</b></font>) has spent a large fortune in litigation.
He (<font color='blue'><b>Frankland</b></font>) fights for the mere pleasure of fighting and is equally ready to take
up either side of a question, so that it is no wonder that he (<font color='blue'><b>Frankland</b></font>) has found
it a costly amusement. Sometimes he (<font color='blue'><b>Frankland</b></font>) will shut up a right of way and defy
the parish to make him (<font color='blue'><b>Frankland</b></font>) open it. At others he (<font color='blue'><b>Frankland</b></font>) will with his (<font color='blue'><b>Frankland</b></font>) own hands
tear down some other man's gate and declare that a path has existed
there from time immemorial, defying the owner to prosecute him (<font color='blue'><b>owner</b></font>) for
trespass. He (<font color='blue'><b>owner</b></font>) is learned in old manorial and communal rights, and he (<font color='blue'><b>owner</b></font>)
applies his (<font color='blue'><b>owner</b></font>) knowledge sometimes in favour of the villagers of Fernworthy
and sometimes against them, so that he (<font color='blue'><b>owner</b></font>) is periodically either carried in
triumph down the village street or else burned in effigy, according to
his (<font color='blue'><b>owner</b></font>) latest exploit. He (<font color='blue'><b>owner</b></font>) is said to have about seven lawsuits upon his (<font color='blue'><b>owner</b></font>)
hands at present, which will probably swallow up the remainder of his (<font color='blue'><b>owner</b></font>)
fortune and so draw his (<font color='blue'><b>owner</b></font>) sting and leave him (<font color='blue'><b>owner</b></font>) harmless for the future.
Apart from the law he (<font color='blue'><b>owner</b></font>) seems a kindly, good-natured person, and I
only mention him (<font color='blue'><b>owner</b></font>) because you were particular that I should send some
description of the people who surround us. He (<font color='blue'><b>owner</b></font>) is curiously employed
at present, for, being an amateur astronomer, he (<font color='blue'><b>owner</b></font>) has an excellent
telescope, with which he (<font color='blue'><b>owner</b></font>) lies upon the roof of his (<font color='blue'><b>owner</b></font>) own house and sweeps
the moor all day in the hope of catching a glimpse of the escaped
convict. If he (<font color='blue'><b>owner</b></font>) would confine his (<font color='blue'><b>owner</b></font>) energies to this all would be well, but
there are rumours that he (<font color='blue'><b>owner</b></font>) intends to prosecute Dr. Mortimer for opening
a grave without the consent of the next of kin because he (<font color='blue'><b>owner</b></font>) dug up the
Neolithic skull in the barrow on Long Down. He (<font color='blue'><b>owner</b></font>) helps to keep our lives
from being monotonous and gives a little comic relief where it is badly
needed.

<p/>And now, having brought you up to date in the escaped convict, the
Stapletons, Dr. Mortimer, and Frankland, of Lafter Hall, let me end on
that which is most important and tell you more about the Barrymores, and
especially about the surprising development of last night.

<p/>First of all about the test telegram, which you sent from London in
order to make sure that Barrymore was really here. I have already
explained that the testimony of the postmaster shows that the test was
worthless and that we have no proof one way or the other. I told Sir
Henry how the matter stood, and he (<font color='blue'><b>Henry</b></font>) at once, in his (<font color='blue'><b>Henry</b></font>) downright fashion,
had Barrymore up and asked him (<font color='blue'><b>Henry</b></font>) whether he (<font color='blue'><b>Henry</b></font>) had received the telegram
himself. Barrymore said that he (<font color='blue'><b>Henry</b></font>) had.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Did the boy deliver it into your own hands?''  (<font color='red'><b>Henry/Henry Baskerville/Baskerville</b></font>)</div>asked Sir Henry.

<p/>Barrymore looked surprised, and considered for a little time.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``No,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>said he (<font color='blue'><b>Henry</b></font>), <div class="bookquote">``I was in the box-room at the time, and my wife brought
it up to me.''

 (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Did you answer it yourself?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``No; I told my wife what to answer and she (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>) went down to write it.''

 (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div><p/>In the evening he (<font color='blue'><b>Henry</b></font>) recurred to the subject of his (<font color='blue'><b>Henry</b></font>) own accord.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``I could not quite understand the object of your questions this morning,
Sir Henry,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>said he (<font color='blue'><b>Henry</b></font>). <div class="bookquote">``I trust that they do not mean that I have done
anything to forfeit your confidence?''

 (<font color='red'><b>Henry/Henry Baskerville/Baskerville</b></font>)</div><p/>Sir Henry had to assure him (<font color='blue'><b>Henry</b></font>) that it was not so and pacify him (<font color='blue'><b>Henry</b></font>) by giving
him (<font color='blue'><b>Henry</b></font>) a considerable part of his (<font color='blue'><b>Henry</b></font>) old wardrobe, the London outfit having
now all arrived.

<p/>Mrs. Barrymore is of interest to me. She (<font color='blue'><b>Barrymore</b></font>) is a heavy, solid person, very
limited, intensely respectable, and inclined to be puritanical. You
could hardly conceive a less emotional subject. Yet I have told you how,
on the first night here, I heard her (<font color='blue'><b>Barrymore</b></font>) sobbing bitterly, and since then
I have more than once observed traces of tears upon her (<font color='blue'><b>Barrymore</b></font>) face. Some deep
sorrow gnaws ever at her (<font color='blue'><b>Barrymore</b></font>) heart. Sometimes I wonder if she (<font color='blue'><b>Barrymore</b></font>) has a guilty
memory which haunts her (<font color='blue'><b>Barrymore</b></font>), and sometimes I suspect Barrymore of being a
domestic tyrant. I have always felt that there was something singular
and questionable in this man's character, but the adventure of last
night brings all my suspicions to a head.

<p/>And yet it may seem a small matter in itself. You are aware that I am
not a very sound sleeper, and since I have been on guard in this house
my slumbers have been lighter than ever. Last night, about two in the
morning, I was aroused by a stealthy step passing my room. I rose,
opened my door, and peeped out. A long black shadow was trailing down
the corridor. It was thrown by a man who walked softly down the passage
with a candle held in his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) hand. He (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) was in shirt and trousers, with no
covering to his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) feet. I could merely see the outline, but his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) height
told me that it was Barrymore. He (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) walked very slowly and circumspectly,
and there was something indescribably guilty and furtive in his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) whole
appearance.

<p/>I have told you that the corridor is broken by the balcony which runs
round the hall, but that it is resumed upon the farther side. I waited
until he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) had passed out of sight and then I followed him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>). When I came
round the balcony he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) had reached the end of the farther corridor, and
I could see from the glimmer of light through an open door that he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>)
had entered one of the rooms. Now, all these rooms are unfurnished and
unoccupied so that his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) expedition became more mysterious than ever. The
light shone steadily as if he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) were standing motionless. I crept down
the passage as noiselessly as I could and peeped round the corner of the
door.

<p/>Barrymore was crouching at the window with the candle held against the
glass. His (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) profile was half turned towards me, and his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) face seemed to be
rigid with expectation as he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) stared out into the blackness of the moor.
For some minutes he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) stood watching intently. Then he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) gave a deep groan
and with an impatient gesture he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) put out the light. Instantly I made my
way back to my room, and very shortly came the stealthy steps passing
once more upon their return journey. Long afterwards when I had fallen
into a light sleep I heard a key turn somewhere in a lock, but I could
not tell whence the sound came. What it all means I cannot guess, but
there is some secret business going on in this house of gloom which
sooner or later we shall get to the bottom of. I do not trouble you with
my theories, for you asked me to furnish you only with facts. I have
had a long talk with Sir Henry this morning, and we have made a plan of
campaign founded upon my observations of last night. I will not speak
about it just now, but it should make my next report interesting
reading.




<p/>Chapter 9. The Light upon the Moor -LSB-Second Report of Dr. Watson-RSB-



<p/>Baskerville Hall, Oct. 15th. MY DEAR HOLMES: If I was compelled to
leave you without much news during the early days of my mission you must
acknowledge that I am making up for lost time, and that events are now
crowding thick and fast upon us. In my last report I ended upon my top
note with Barrymore at the window, and now I have quite a budget already
which will, unless I am much mistaken, considerably surprise you. Things
have taken a turn which I could not have anticipated. In some ways they
have within the last forty-eight hours become much clearer and in some
ways they have become more complicated. But I will tell you all and you
shall judge for yourself.

<p/>Before breakfast on the morning following my adventure I went down the
corridor and examined the room in which Barrymore had been on the night
before. The western window through which he (<font color='blue'><b>they</b></font>) had stared so intently has,
I noticed, one peculiarity above all other windows in the house--it
commands the nearest outlook on to the moor. There is an opening between
two trees which enables one from this point of view to look right down
upon it, while from all the other windows it is only a distant glimpse
which can be obtained. It follows, therefore, that Barrymore, since
only this window would serve the purpose, must have been looking out for
something or somebody upon the moor. The night was very dark, so that I
can hardly imagine how he (<font color='blue'><b>it</b></font>) could have hoped to see anyone. It had struck
me that it was possible that some love intrigue was on foot. That would
have accounted for his (<font color='blue'><b>it</b></font>) stealthy movements and also for the uneasiness
of his (<font color='blue'><b>it</b></font>) wife. The man is a striking-looking fellow, very well equipped
to steal the heart of a country girl, so that this theory seemed to
have something to support it. That opening of the door which I had heard
after I had returned to my room might mean that he (<font color='blue'><b>it</b></font>) had gone out to keep
some clandestine appointment. So I reasoned with myself in the morning,
and I tell you the direction of my suspicions, however much the result
may have shown that they were unfounded.

<p/>But whatever the true explanation of Barrymore's movements might be,
I felt that the responsibility of keeping them to myself until I could
explain them was more than I could bear. I had an interview with the
baronet in his (<font color='blue'><b>it</b></font>) study after breakfast, and I told him (<font color='blue'><b>it</b></font>) all that I had
seen. He (<font color='blue'><b>it</b></font>) was less surprised than I had expected.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``I knew that Barrymore walked about nights, and I had a mind to speak
to him (<font color='blue'><b>Henry</b></font>) about it,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>said he (<font color='blue'><b>it</b></font>). <div class="bookquote">``Two or three times I have heard his (<font color='blue'><b>Henry</b></font>) steps in
the passage, coming and going, just about the hour you name.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Perhaps then he (<font color='blue'><b>Henry</b></font>) pays a visit every night to that particular window,''  (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div>I
suggested.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Perhaps he (<font color='blue'><b>Henry</b></font>) does. If so, we should be able to shadow him (<font color='blue'><b>Henry</b></font>) and see what
it is that he (<font color='blue'><b>Henry</b></font>) is after. I wonder what your friend Holmes would do if he (<font color='blue'><b>Holmes</b></font>)
were here.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I believe that he (<font color='blue'><b>Holmes</b></font>) would do exactly what you now suggest,''  (<font color='red'><b>I.</b></font>)</div>said I. <div class="bookquote">``He (<font color='blue'><b>Holmes</b></font>)
would follow Barrymore and see what he (<font color='blue'><b>Holmes</b></font>) did.''

 (<font color='red'><b>I.</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Then we shall do it together.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``But surely he (<font color='blue'><b>Holmes</b></font>) would hear us.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``The man is rather deaf, and in any case we must take our chance of
that. We'll sit up in my room tonight and wait until he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) passes.''  (<font color='red'><b>Henry/Henry Baskerville/Baskerville</b></font>)</div>Sir
Henry rubbed his (<font color='blue'><b>Henry</b></font>) hands with pleasure, and it was evident that he (<font color='blue'><b>Henry</b></font>) hailed
the adventure as a relief to his (<font color='blue'><b>Henry</b></font>) somewhat quiet life upon the moor.

<p/>The baronet has been in communication with the architect who prepared
the plans for Sir Charles, and with a contractor from London, so that we
may expect great changes to begin here soon. There have been decorators
and furnishers up from Plymouth, and it is evident that our friend
has large ideas and means to spare no pains or expense to restore the
grandeur of his (<font color='blue'><b>friend</b></font>) family. When the house is renovated and refurnished, all
that he (<font color='blue'><b>friend</b></font>) will need will be a wife to make it complete. Between ourselves
there are pretty clear signs that this will not be wanting if the lady
is willing, for I have seldom seen a man more infatuated with a woman
than he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) is with our beautiful neighbour, Miss Stapleton. And yet the
course of true love does not run quite as smoothly as one would under
the circumstances expect. Today, for example, its surface was broken
by a very unexpected ripple, which has caused our friend considerable
perplexity and annoyance.

<p/>After the conversation which I have quoted about Barrymore, Sir Henry
put on his (<font color='blue'><b>Henry</b></font>) hat and prepared to go out. As a matter of course I did the
same.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``What, are you coming, Watson?''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Henry</b></font>) asked, looking at me in a curious
way.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``That depends on whether you are going on the moor,''  (<font color='red'><b>I.</b></font>)</div>said I.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Yes, I am.''

 (<font color='red'><b>I.</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Well, you know what my instructions are. I am sorry to intrude, but
you heard how earnestly Holmes insisted that I should not leave you, and
especially that you should not go alone upon the moor.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Henry/Henry Baskerville/Baskerville</b></font>)</div><p/>Sir Henry put his (<font color='blue'><b>Henry</b></font>) hand upon my shoulder with a pleasant smile.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``My dear fellow,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>said he (<font color='blue'><b>Henry</b></font>), <div class="bookquote">``Holmes, with all his (<font color='blue'><b>Holmes</b></font>) wisdom, did not foresee
some things which have happened since I have been on the moor. You
understand me? I am sure that you are the last man in the world who
would wish to be a spoil-sport. I must go out alone.''

 (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div><p/>It put me in a most awkward position. I was at a loss what to say or
what to do, and before I had made up my mind he (<font color='blue'><b>Henry</b></font>) picked up his (<font color='blue'><b>Henry</b></font>) cane and
was gone.

<p/>But when I came to think the matter over my conscience reproached me
bitterly for having on any pretext allowed him (<font color='blue'><b>Henry</b></font>) to go out of my sight.
I imagined what my feelings would be if I had to return to you and to
confess that some misfortune had occurred through my disregard for your
instructions. I assure you my cheeks flushed at the very thought. It
might not even now be too late to overtake him (<font color='blue'><b>Henry</b></font>), so I set off at once in
the direction of Merripit House.

<p/>I hurried along the road at the top of my speed without seeing anything
of Sir Henry, until I came to the point where the moor path branches
off. There, fearing that perhaps I had come in the wrong direction after
all, I mounted a hill from which I could command a view--the same hill
which is cut into the dark quarry. Thence I saw him (<font color='blue'><b>Henry</b></font>) at once. He (<font color='blue'><b>Henry</b></font>) was on
the moor path about a quarter of a mile off, and a lady was by his (<font color='blue'><b>Henry</b></font>) side
who could only be Miss Stapleton. It was clear that there was already
an understanding between them and that they had met by appointment. They
were walking slowly along in deep conversation, and I saw her (<font color='blue'><b>Stapleton</b></font>) making
quick little movements of her (<font color='blue'><b>Stapleton</b></font>) hands as if she (<font color='blue'><b>Stapleton</b></font>) were very earnest in what
she (<font color='blue'><b>Stapleton</b></font>) was saying, while he (<font color='blue'><b>Henry</b></font>) listened intently, and once or twice shook his (<font color='blue'><b>Henry</b></font>)
head in strong dissent. I stood among the rocks watching them, very much
puzzled as to what I should do next. To follow them and break into their
intimate conversation seemed to be an outrage, and yet my clear duty was
never for an instant to let him (<font color='blue'><b>Henry</b></font>) out of my sight. To act the spy upon a
friend was a hateful task. Still, I could see no better course than to
observe him (<font color='blue'><b>friend</b></font>) from the hill, and to clear my conscience by confessing to
him (<font color='blue'><b>friend</b></font>) afterwards what I had done. It is true that if any sudden danger had
threatened him (<font color='blue'><b>friend</b></font>) I was too far away to be of use, and yet I am sure that
you will agree with me that the position was very difficult, and that
there was nothing more which I could do.

<p/>Our friend, Sir Henry, and the lady had halted on the path and were
standing deeply absorbed in their conversation, when I was suddenly
aware that I was not the only witness of their interview. A wisp of
green floating in the air caught my eye, and another glance showed me
that it was carried on a stick by a man who was moving among the broken
ground. It was Stapleton with his (<font color='blue'><b>Stapleton</b></font>) butterfly-net. He (<font color='blue'><b>Stapleton</b></font>) was very much closer
to the pair than I was, and he (<font color='blue'><b>Stapleton</b></font>) appeared to be moving in their direction.
At this instant Sir Henry suddenly drew Miss Stapleton to his (<font color='blue'><b>Henry</b></font>) side. His (<font color='blue'><b>Henry</b></font>)
arm was round her (<font color='blue'><b>Stapleton</b></font>), but it seemed to me that she (<font color='blue'><b>Stapleton</b></font>) was straining away from
him (<font color='blue'><b>Henry</b></font>) with her (<font color='blue'><b>Stapleton</b></font>) face averted. He (<font color='blue'><b>Henry</b></font>) stooped his (<font color='blue'><b>Henry</b></font>) head to hers, and she (<font color='blue'><b>Stapleton</b></font>) raised
one hand as if in protest. Next moment I saw them spring apart and turn
hurriedly round. Stapleton was the cause of the interruption. He (<font color='blue'><b>Stapleton</b></font>) was
running wildly towards them, his (<font color='blue'><b>Stapleton</b></font>) absurd net dangling behind him (<font color='blue'><b>Stapleton</b></font>). He (<font color='blue'><b>Stapleton</b></font>)
gesticulated and almost danced with excitement in front of the lovers.
What the scene meant I could not imagine, but it seemed to me that
Stapleton was abusing Sir Henry, who offered explanations, which became
more angry as the other refused to accept them. The lady stood by in
haughty silence. Finally Stapleton turned upon his (<font color='blue'><b>Stapleton</b></font>) heel and beckoned in
a peremptory way to his (<font color='blue'><b>Stapleton</b></font>) sister, who, after an irresolute glance at Sir
Henry, walked off by the side of her (<font color='blue'><b>sister</b></font>) brother. The naturalist's angry
gestures showed that the lady was included in his (<font color='blue'><b>naturalist</b></font>) displeasure. The
baronet stood for a minute looking after them, and then he (<font color='blue'><b>naturalist</b></font>) walked slowly
back the way that he (<font color='blue'><b>naturalist</b></font>) had come, his (<font color='blue'><b>naturalist</b></font>) head hanging, the very picture of
dejection.

<p/>What all this meant I could not imagine, but I was deeply ashamed to
have witnessed so intimate a scene without my friend's knowledge. I ran
down the hill therefore and met the baronet at the bottom. His (<font color='blue'><b>friend</b></font>) face was
flushed with anger and his (<font color='blue'><b>friend</b></font>) brows were wrinkled, like one who is at his (<font color='blue'><b>friend</b></font>)
wit's ends what to do.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Halloa, Watson! Where have you dropped from?''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>said he (<font color='blue'><b>friend</b></font>). <div class="bookquote">``You don't mean
to say that you came after me in spite of all?''

 (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div><p/>I explained everything to him (<font color='blue'><b>friend</b></font>): how I had found it impossible to remain
behind, how I had followed him (<font color='blue'><b>friend</b></font>), and how I had witnessed all that
had occurred. For an instant his (<font color='blue'><b>friend</b></font>) eyes blazed at me, but my frankness
disarmed his (<font color='blue'><b>friend</b></font>) anger, and he (<font color='blue'><b>friend</b></font>) broke at last into a rather rueful laugh.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``You would have thought the middle of that prairie a fairly safe
place for a man to be private,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>said he (<font color='blue'><b>friend</b></font>), <div class="bookquote">``but, by thunder, the whole
countryside seems to have been out to see me do my wooing--and a mighty
poor wooing at that! Where had you engaged a seat?''

 (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I was on that hill.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Quite in the back row, eh? But her (<font color='blue'><b>my</b></font>) brother was well up to the front.
Did you see him (<font color='blue'><b>brother</b></font>) come out on us?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Yes, I did.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Did he (<font color='blue'><b>brother</b></font>) ever strike you as being crazy--this brother of hers?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I can't say that he (<font color='blue'><b>brother</b></font>) ever did.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I dare say not. I always thought him (<font color='blue'><b>brother</b></font>) sane enough until today, but you
can take it from me that either he (<font color='blue'><b>brother</b></font>) or I ought to be in a straitjacket.
What's the matter with me, anyhow? You've lived near me for some weeks,
Watson. Tell me straight, now! Is there anything that would prevent me
from making a good husband to a woman that I loved?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I should say not.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``He (<font color='blue'><b>husband</b></font>) can't object to my worldly position, so it must be myself that he (<font color='blue'><b>husband</b></font>)
has this down on. What has he (<font color='blue'><b>husband</b></font>) against me? I never hurt man or woman in
my life that I know of. And yet he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) would not so much as let me touch the
tips of her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) fingers.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Did he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) say so?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``That, and a deal more. I tell you, Watson, I've only known her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) these
few weeks, but from the first I just felt that she (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) was made for me,
and she (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>), too--she (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) was happy when she (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) was with me, and that I'll swear.
There's a light in a woman's eyes that speaks louder than words. But he (<font color='blue'><b>Watson</b></font>)
has never let us get together and it was only today for the first time
that I saw a chance of having a few words with her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) alone. She (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) was glad
to meet me, but when she (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) did it was not love that she (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) would talk about,
and she (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) wouldn't have let me talk about it either if she (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) could have
stopped it. She (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) kept coming back to it that this was a place of danger,
and that she (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) would never be happy until I had left it. I told her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) that
since I had seen her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) I was in no hurry to leave it, and that if she (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>)
really wanted me to go, the only way to work it was for her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) to arrange
to go with me. With that I offered in as many words to marry her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>), but
before she (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) could answer, down came this brother of hers, running at us
with a face on him (<font color='blue'><b>brother</b></font>) like a madman. He (<font color='blue'><b>brother</b></font>) was just white with rage, and those
light eyes of his (<font color='blue'><b>brother</b></font>) were blazing with fury. What was I doing with the
lady? How dared I offer her (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) attentions which were distasteful to her (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>)?
Did I think that because I was a baronet I could do what I liked? If he (<font color='blue'><b>brother</b></font>)
had not been her (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) brother I should have known better how to answer him (<font color='blue'><b>brother</b></font>).
As it was I told him (<font color='blue'><b>brother</b></font>) that my feelings towards his (<font color='blue'><b>brother</b></font>) sister were such as
I was not ashamed of, and that I hoped that she (<font color='blue'><b>sister</b></font>) might honour me by
becoming my wife. That seemed to make the matter no better, so then I
lost my temper too, and I answered him (<font color='blue'><b>brother</b></font>) rather more hotly than I should
perhaps, considering that she (<font color='blue'><b>sister</b></font>) was standing by. So it ended by his (<font color='blue'><b>brother</b></font>) going
off with her (<font color='blue'><b>sister</b></font>), as you saw, and here am I as badly puzzled a man as any
in this county. Just tell me what it all means, Watson, and I'll owe you
more than ever I can hope to pay.''

 (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div><p/>I tried one or two explanations, but, indeed, I was completely puzzled
myself. Our friend's title, his (<font color='blue'><b>friend</b></font>) fortune, his (<font color='blue'><b>friend</b></font>) age, his (<font color='blue'><b>friend</b></font>) character, and his (<font color='blue'><b>friend</b></font>)
appearance are all in his (<font color='blue'><b>friend</b></font>) favour, and I know nothing against him (<font color='blue'><b>friend</b></font>) unless
it be this dark fate which runs in his (<font color='blue'><b>friend</b></font>) family. That his (<font color='blue'><b>friend</b></font>) advances should
be rejected so brusquely without any reference to the lady's own wishes
and that the lady should accept the situation without protest is very
amazing. However, our conjectures were set at rest by a visit from
Stapleton himself that very afternoon. He (<font color='blue'><b>Stapleton</b></font>) had come to offer apologies
for his (<font color='blue'><b>Stapleton</b></font>) rudeness of the morning, and after a long private interview with
Sir Henry in his (<font color='blue'><b>Henry</b></font>) study the upshot of their conversation was that the
breach is quite healed, and that we are to dine at Merripit House next
Friday as a sign of it.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``I don't say now that he (<font color='blue'><b>Watson</b></font>) isn't a crazy man,''  (<font color='red'><b>Henry/Henry Baskerville/Baskerville</b></font>)</div>said Sir Henry; <div class="bookquote">``I can't
forget the look in his (<font color='blue'><b>Watson</b></font>) eyes when he (<font color='blue'><b>Watson</b></font>) ran at me this morning, but I must
allow that no man could make a more handsome apology than he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) has done.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Henry/Henry Baskerville/Baskerville</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Did he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) give any explanation of his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) conduct?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``His (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) sister is everything in his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) life, he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) says. That is natural enough,
and I am glad that he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) should understand her (<font color='blue'><b>sister</b></font>) value. They have always been
together, and according to his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) account he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) has been a very lonely man
with only her (<font color='blue'><b>sister</b></font>) as a companion, so that the thought of losing her (<font color='blue'><b>sister</b></font>) was
really terrible to him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>). He (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) had not understood, he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) said, that I was
becoming attached to her (<font color='blue'><b>sister</b></font>), but when he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) saw with his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) own eyes that it was
really so, and that she (<font color='blue'><b>sister</b></font>) might be taken away from him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>), it gave him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) such a
shock that for a time he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) was not responsible for what he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) said or did.
He (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) was very sorry for all that had passed, and he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) recognized how foolish
and how selfish it was that he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) should imagine that he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) could hold a
beautiful woman like his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) sister to himself for her (<font color='blue'><b>sister</b></font>) whole life. If she (<font color='blue'><b>sister</b></font>)
had to leave him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) had rather it was to a neighbour like myself than to
anyone else. But in any case it was a blow to him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) and it would take him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>)
some time before he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) could prepare himself to meet it. He (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) would withdraw
all opposition upon his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) part if I would promise for three months to let
the matter rest and to be content with cultivating the lady's friendship
during that time without claiming her (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) love. This I promised, and so the
matter rests.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/>So there is one of our small mysteries cleared up. It is something to
have touched bottom anywhere in this bog in which we are floundering.
We know now why Stapleton looked with disfavour upon his (<font color='blue'><b>Stapleton</b></font>) sister's
suitor--even when that suitor was so eligible a one as Sir Henry. And
now I pass on to another thread which I have extricated out of the
tangled skein, the mystery of the sobs in the night, of the tear-stained
face of Mrs. Barrymore, of the secret journey of the butler to the
western lattice window. Congratulate me, my dear Holmes, and tell me
that I have not disappointed you as an agent--that you do not regret
the confidence which you showed in me when you sent me down. All these
things have by one night's work been thoroughly cleared.

<p/>I have said <div class="bookquote">``by one night's work,''  (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div>but, in truth, it was by two nights'
work, for on the first we drew entirely blank. I sat up with Sir Henry
in his (<font color='blue'><b>Henry</b></font>) rooms until nearly three o’clock in the morning, but no sound of
any sort did we hear except the chiming clock upon the stairs. It was
a most melancholy vigil and ended by each of us falling asleep in our
chairs. Fortunately we were not discouraged, and we determined to try
again. The next night we lowered the lamp and sat smoking cigarettes
without making the least sound. It was incredible how slowly the hours
crawled by, and yet we were helped through it by the same sort of
patient interest which the hunter must feel as he (<font color='blue'><b>hunter</b></font>) watches the trap into
which he (<font color='blue'><b>hunter</b></font>) hopes the game may wander. One struck, and two, and we had
almost for the second time given it up in despair when in an instant we
both sat bolt upright in our chairs with all our weary senses keenly on
the alert once more. We had heard the creak of a step in the passage.

<p/>Very stealthily we heard it pass along until it died away in the
distance. Then the baronet gently opened his (<font color='blue'><b>hunter</b></font>) door and we set out in
pursuit. Already our man had gone round the gallery and the corridor was
all in darkness. Softly we stole along until we had come into the other
wing. We were just in time to catch a glimpse of the tall, black-bearded
figure, his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) shoulders rounded as he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) tiptoed down the passage. Then he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>)
passed through the same door as before, and the light of the candle
framed it in the darkness and shot one single yellow beam across the
gloom of the corridor. We shuffled cautiously towards it, trying every
plank before we dared to put our whole weight upon it. We had taken the
precaution of leaving our boots behind us, but, even so, the old boards
snapped and creaked beneath our tread. Sometimes it seemed impossible
that he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) should fail to hear our approach. However, the man is
fortunately rather deaf, and he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) was entirely preoccupied in that which
he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) was doing. When at last we reached the door and peeped through we
found him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) crouching at the window, candle in hand, his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) white, intent
face pressed against the pane, exactly as I had seen him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) two nights
before.

<p/>We had arranged no plan of campaign, but the baronet is a man to whom
the most direct way is always the most natural. He (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) walked into the room,
and as he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) did so Barrymore sprang up from the window with a sharp hiss
of his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) breath and stood, livid and trembling, before us. His (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) dark eyes,
glaring out of the white mask of his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) face, were full of horror and
astonishment as he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) gazed from Sir Henry to me.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``What are you doing here, Barrymore?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Nothing, sir.''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>His (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) agitation was so great that he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) could hardly speak,
and the shadows sprang up and down from the shaking of his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) candle. <div class="bookquote">``It
was the window, sir. I go round at night to see that they are fastened.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``On the second floor?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Yes, sir, all the windows.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Look here, Barrymore,''  (<font color='red'><b>Henry/Henry Baskerville/Baskerville</b></font>)</div>said Sir Henry sternly, <div class="bookquote">``we have made up our
minds to have the truth out of you, so it will save you trouble to tell
it sooner rather than later. Come, now! No lies! What were you doing at
that window?''

 (<font color='red'><b>Henry/Henry Baskerville/Baskerville</b></font>)</div><p/>The fellow looked at us in a helpless way, and he (<font color='blue'><b>Henry</b></font>) wrung his (<font color='blue'><b>Henry</b></font>) hands
together like one who is in the last extremity of doubt and misery.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``I was doing no harm, sir. I was holding a candle to the window.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``And why were you holding a candle to the window?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Don't ask me, Sir Henry--don't ask me! I give you my word, sir, that it
is not my secret, and that I cannot tell it. If it concerned no one but
myself I would not try to keep it from you.''

 (<font color='red'><b>me</b></font>)</div><p/>A sudden idea occurred to me, and I took the candle from the trembling
hand of the butler.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``He (<font color='blue'><b>Henry</b></font>) must have been holding it as a signal,''  (<font color='red'><b>I.</b></font>)</div>said I. <div class="bookquote">``Let us see if
there is any answer.''  (<font color='red'><b>I.</b></font>)</div>I held it as he (<font color='blue'><b>butler</b></font>) had done, and stared out into the
darkness of the night. Vaguely I could discern the black bank of the
trees and the lighter expanse of the moor, for the moon was behind the
clouds. And then I gave a cry of exultation, for a tiny pinpoint of
yellow light had suddenly transfixed the dark veil, and glowed steadily
in the centre of the black square framed by the window.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``There it is!''  (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div>I cried.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``No, no, sir, it is nothing--nothing at all!''  (<font color='red'><b>the butler</b></font>)</div>the butler broke in; <div class="bookquote">``I
assure you, sir--''

 (<font color='red'><b>the butler</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Move your light across the window, Watson!''  (<font color='red'><b>the butler</b></font>)</div>cried the baronet. <div class="bookquote">``See,
the other moves also! Now, you rascal, do you deny that it is a signal?
Come, speak up! Who is your confederate out yonder, and what is this
conspiracy that is going on?''

 (<font color='red'><b>The man</b></font>)</div><p/>The man's face became openly defiant. <div class="bookquote">``It is my business, and not yours.
I will not tell.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Then you leave my employment right away.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Very good, sir. If I must I must.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``And you go in disgrace. By thunder, you may well be ashamed of
yourself. Your family has lived with mine for over a hundred years under
this roof, and here I find you deep in some dark plot against me.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``No, no, sir; no, not against you!''  (<font color='red'><b>a woman</b></font>)</div>It was a woman's voice, and Mrs.
Barrymore, paler and more horror-struck than her (<font color='blue'><b>Barrymore</b></font>) husband, was standing
at the door. Her (<font color='blue'><b>Barrymore</b></font>) bulky figure in a shawl and skirt might have been comic
were it not for the intensity of feeling upon her (<font color='blue'><b>Barrymore</b></font>) face.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``We have to go, Eliza. This is the end of it. You can pack our things,''
 (<font color='red'><b>the butler</b></font>)</div>said the butler.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Oh, John, John, have I brought you to this? It is my doing, Sir
Henry--all mine. He (<font color='blue'><b>Henry</b></font>) has done nothing except for my sake and because I
asked him (<font color='blue'><b>Henry</b></font>).''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Speak out, then! What does it mean?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``My unhappy brother is starving on the moor. We cannot let him (<font color='blue'><b>brother</b></font>) perish at
our very gates. The light is a signal to him (<font color='blue'><b>brother</b></font>) that food is ready for him (<font color='blue'><b>brother</b></font>),
and his (<font color='blue'><b>brother</b></font>) light out yonder is to show the spot to which to bring it.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Then your brother is--''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``The escaped convict, sir--Selden, the criminal.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``That's the truth, sir,''  (<font color='red'><b>Barrymore/Mrs. Barrymore</b></font>)</div>said Barrymore. <div class="bookquote">``I said that it was not my
secret and that I could not tell it to you. But now you have heard it,
and you will see that if there was a plot it was not against you.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/>This, then, was the explanation of the stealthy expeditions at night
and the light at the window. Sir Henry and I both stared at the woman in
amazement. Was it possible that this stolidly respectable person was of
the same blood as one of the most notorious criminals in the country?

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Yes, sir, my name was Selden, and he (<font color='blue'><b>brother</b></font>) is my younger brother. We humoured
him (<font color='blue'><b>brother</b></font>) too much when he (<font color='blue'><b>brother</b></font>) was a lad and gave him (<font color='blue'><b>brother</b></font>) his (<font color='blue'><b>brother</b></font>) own way in everything
until he (<font color='blue'><b>brother</b></font>) came to think that the world was made for his (<font color='blue'><b>brother</b></font>) pleasure, and
that he (<font color='blue'><b>brother</b></font>) could do what he (<font color='blue'><b>brother</b></font>) liked in it. Then as he (<font color='blue'><b>brother</b></font>) grew older he (<font color='blue'><b>brother</b></font>) met
wicked companions, and the devil entered into him (<font color='blue'><b>devil</b></font>) until he (<font color='blue'><b>devil</b></font>) broke my
mother's heart and dragged our name in the dirt. From crime to crime
he (<font color='blue'><b>devil</b></font>) sank lower and lower until it is only the mercy of God which has
snatched him (<font color='blue'><b>God</b></font>) from the scaffold; but to me, sir, he (<font color='blue'><b>God</b></font>) was always the little
curly-headed boy that I had nursed and played with as an elder sister
would. That was why he (<font color='blue'><b>God</b></font>) broke prison, sir. He (<font color='blue'><b>God</b></font>) knew that I was here and
that we could not refuse to help him (<font color='blue'><b>God</b></font>). When he (<font color='blue'><b>God</b></font>) dragged himself here one
night, weary and starving, with the warders hard at his (<font color='blue'><b>God</b></font>) heels, what
could we do? We took him (<font color='blue'><b>God</b></font>) in and fed him (<font color='blue'><b>God</b></font>) and cared for him (<font color='blue'><b>God</b></font>). Then you
returned, sir, and my brother thought he (<font color='blue'><b>brother</b></font>) would be safer on the moor than
anywhere else until the hue and cry was over, so he (<font color='blue'><b>brother</b></font>) lay in hiding there.
But every second night we made sure if he (<font color='blue'><b>brother</b></font>) was still there by putting a
light in the window, and if there was an answer my husband took out some
bread and meat to him (<font color='blue'><b>husband</b></font>). Every day we hoped that he (<font color='blue'><b>husband</b></font>) was gone, but as long
as he (<font color='blue'><b>husband</b></font>) was there we could not desert him (<font color='blue'><b>husband</b></font>). That is the whole truth, as I
am an honest Christian woman and you will see that if there is blame in
the matter it does not lie with my husband but with me, for whose sake
he (<font color='blue'><b>husband</b></font>) has done all that he (<font color='blue'><b>husband</b></font>) has.''

 (<font color='red'><b>The woman</b></font>)</div><p/>The woman's words came with an intense earnestness which carried
conviction with them.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Is this true, Barrymore?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Yes, Sir Henry. Every word of it.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Well, I cannot blame you for standing by your own wife. Forget what
I have said. Go to your room, you two, and we shall talk further about
this matter in the morning.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/>When they were gone we looked out of the window again. Sir Henry had
flung it open, and the cold night wind beat in upon our faces. Far away
in the black distance there still glowed that one tiny point of yellow
light.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``I wonder he (<font color='blue'><b>Henry</b></font>) dares,''  (<font color='red'><b>Henry/Henry Baskerville/Baskerville</b></font>)</div>said Sir Henry.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``It may be so placed as to be only visible from here.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Very likely. How far do you think it is?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Out by the Cleft Tor, I think.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Not more than a mile or two off.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Hardly that.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Well, it cannot be far if Barrymore had to carry out the food to it.
And he (<font color='blue'><b>Henry</b></font>) is waiting, this villain, beside that candle. By thunder, Watson,
I am going out to take that man!''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/>The same thought had crossed my own mind. It was not as if the
Barrymores had taken us into their confidence. Their secret had been
forced from them. The man was a danger to the community, an unmitigated
scoundrel for whom there was neither pity nor excuse. We were only doing
our duty in taking this chance of putting him (<font color='blue'><b>scoundrel</b></font>) back where he (<font color='blue'><b>scoundrel</b></font>) could do no
harm. With his (<font color='blue'><b>scoundrel</b></font>) brutal and violent nature, others would have to pay the
price if we held our hands. Any night, for example, our neighbours the
Stapletons might be attacked by him (<font color='blue'><b>scoundrel</b></font>), and it may have been the thought of
this which made Sir Henry so keen upon the adventure.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``I will come,''  (<font color='red'><b>I.</b></font>)</div>said I.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Then get your revolver and put on your boots. The sooner we start the
better, as the fellow may put out his (<font color='blue'><b>fellow</b></font>) light and be off.''

 (<font color='red'><b>I.</b></font>)</div><p/>In five minutes we were outside the door, starting upon our expedition.
We hurried through the dark shrubbery, amid the dull moaning of the
autumn wind and the rustle of the falling leaves. The night air was
heavy with the smell of damp and decay. Now and again the moon peeped
out for an instant, but clouds were driving over the face of the sky,
and just as we came out on the moor a thin rain began to fall. The light
still burned steadily in front.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Are you armed?''  (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div>I asked.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``I have a hunting-crop.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``We must close in on him (<font color='blue'><b>fellow</b></font>) rapidly, for he (<font color='blue'><b>fellow</b></font>) is said to be a desperate
fellow. We shall take him (<font color='blue'><b>fellow</b></font>) by surprise and have him (<font color='blue'><b>fellow</b></font>) at our mercy before
he (<font color='blue'><b>fellow</b></font>) can resist.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I say, Watson,''  (<font color='red'><b>the baronet</b></font>)</div>said the baronet, <div class="bookquote">``what would Holmes say to this? How
about that hour of darkness in which the power of evil is exalted?''

 (<font color='red'><b>the baronet</b></font>)</div><p/>As if in answer to his (<font color='blue'><b>we</b></font>) words there rose suddenly out of the vast gloom
of the moor that strange cry which I had already heard upon the borders
of the great Grimpen Mire. It came with the wind through the silence
of the night, a long, deep mutter, then a rising howl, and then the sad
moan in which it died away. Again and again it sounded, the whole air
throbbing with it, strident, wild, and menacing. The baronet caught my
sleeve and his (<font color='blue'><b>we</b></font>) face glimmered white through the darkness.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``My God, what's that, Watson?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I don't know. It's a sound they have on the moor. I heard it once
before.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/>It died away, and an absolute silence closed in upon us. We stood
straining our ears, but nothing came.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Watson,''  (<font color='red'><b>the baronet cry</b></font>)</div>said the baronet, <div class="bookquote">``it was the cry of a hound.''

 (<font color='red'><b>the baronet cry</b></font>)</div><p/>My blood ran cold in my veins, for there was a break in his (<font color='blue'><b>we</b></font>) voice which
told of the sudden horror which had seized him (<font color='blue'><b>we</b></font>).

<p/><div class="bookquote">``What do they call this sound?''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>we</b></font>) asked.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Who?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``The folk on the countryside.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Oh, they are ignorant people. Why should you mind what they call it?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Tell me, Watson. What do they say of it?''

 (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div><p/>I hesitated but could not escape the question.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``They say it is the cry of the Hound of the Baskervilles.''

 (<font color='red'><b>He</b></font>)</div><p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>we</b></font>) groaned and was silent for a few moments.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``A hound it was,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>we</b></font>) said at last, <div class="bookquote">``but it seemed to come from miles
away, over yonder, I think.''

 (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``It was hard to say whence it came.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``It rose and fell with the wind. Isn't that the direction of the great
Grimpen Mire?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Yes, it is.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Well, it was up there. Come now, Watson, didn't you think yourself that
it was the cry of a hound? I am not a child. You need not fear to speak
the truth.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Stapleton was with me when I heard it last. He (<font color='blue'><b>Stapleton</b></font>) said that it might be
the calling of a strange bird.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``No, no, it was a hound. My God, can there be some truth in all these
stories? Is it possible that I am really in danger from so dark a cause?
You don't believe it, do you, Watson?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``No, no.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``And yet it was one thing to laugh about it in London, and it is another
to stand out here in the darkness of the moor and to hear such a cry as
that. And my uncle! There was the footprint of the hound beside him (<font color='blue'><b>uncle</b></font>) as
he (<font color='blue'><b>uncle</b></font>) lay. It all fits together. I don't think that I am a coward, Watson,
but that sound seemed to freeze my very blood. Feel my hand!''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/>It was as cold as a block of marble.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``You'll be all right tomorrow.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I don't think I'll get that cry out of my head. What do you advise that
we do now?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Shall we turn back?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``No, by thunder; we have come out to get our man, and we will do it. We
after the convict, and a hell-hound, as likely as not, after us. Come
on! We'll see it through if all the fiends of the pit were loose upon
the moor.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/>We stumbled slowly along in the darkness, with the black loom of the
craggy hills around us, and the yellow speck of light burning steadily
in front. There is nothing so deceptive as the distance of a light upon
a pitch-dark night, and sometimes the glimmer seemed to be far away upon
the horizon and sometimes it might have been within a few yards of us.
But at last we could see whence it came, and then we knew that we were
indeed very close. A guttering candle was stuck in a crevice of the
rocks which flanked it on each side so as to keep the wind from it
and also to prevent it from being visible, save in the direction of
Baskerville Hall. A boulder of granite concealed our approach, and
crouching behind it we gazed over it at the signal light. It was strange
to see this single candle burning there in the middle of the moor, with
no sign of life near it--just the one straight yellow flame and the
gleam of the rock on each side of it.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``What shall we do now?''  (<font color='red'><b>Henry/Henry Baskerville/Baskerville</b></font>)</div>whispered Sir Henry.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Wait here. He (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) must be near his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) light. Let us see if we can get a
glimpse of him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>).''

 (<font color='red'><b>him</b></font>)</div><p/>The words were hardly out of my mouth when we both saw him (<font color='blue'><b>Henry</b></font>). Over the
rocks, in the crevice of which the candle burned, there was thrust out
an evil yellow face, a terrible animal face, all seamed and scored with
vile passions. Foul with mire, with a bristling beard, and hung with
matted hair, it might well have belonged to one of those old savages
who dwelt in the burrows on the hillsides. The light beneath him (<font color='blue'><b>Henry</b></font>) was
reflected in his (<font color='blue'><b>Henry</b></font>) small, cunning eyes which peered fiercely to right and
left through the darkness like a crafty and savage animal who has heard
the steps of the hunters.

<p/>Something had evidently aroused his (<font color='blue'><b>Henry</b></font>) suspicions. It may have been that
Barrymore had some private signal which we had neglected to give, or
the fellow may have had some other reason for thinking that all was not
well, but I could read his (<font color='blue'><b>fellow</b></font>) fears upon his (<font color='blue'><b>fellow</b></font>) wicked face. Any instant he (<font color='blue'><b>fellow</b></font>)
might dash out the light and vanish in the darkness. I sprang forward
therefore, and Sir Henry did the same. At the same moment the convict
screamed out a curse at us and hurled a rock which splintered up against
the boulder which had sheltered us. I caught one glimpse of his (<font color='blue'><b>Henry</b></font>) short,
squat, strongly built figure as he (<font color='blue'><b>Henry</b></font>) sprang to his (<font color='blue'><b>Henry</b></font>) feet and turned to run.
At the same moment by a lucky chance the moon broke through the clouds.
We rushed over the brow of the hill, and there was our man running with
great speed down the other side, springing over the stones in his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) way
with the activity of a mountain goat. A lucky long shot of my revolver
might have crippled him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>), but I had brought it only to defend myself if
attacked and not to shoot an unarmed man who was running away.

<p/>We were both swift runners and in fairly good training, but we soon
found that we had no chance of overtaking him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>). We saw him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) for a long
time in the moonlight until he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) was only a small speck moving swiftly
among the boulders upon the side of a distant hill. We ran and ran until
we were completely blown, but the space between us grew ever wider.
Finally we stopped and sat panting on two rocks, while we watched him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>)
disappearing in the distance.

<p/>And it was at this moment that there occurred a most strange and
unexpected thing. We had risen from our rocks and were turning to go
home, having abandoned the hopeless chase. The moon was low upon the
right, and the jagged pinnacle of a granite tor stood up against the
lower curve of its silver disc. There, outlined as black as an ebony
statue on that shining background, I saw the figure of a man upon the
tor. Do not think that it was a delusion, Holmes. I assure you that
I have never in my life seen anything more clearly. As far as I could
judge, the figure was that of a tall, thin man. He (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) stood with his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) legs
a little separated, his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) arms folded, his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) head bowed, as if he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) were
brooding over that enormous wilderness of peat and granite which lay
before him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>). He (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) might have been the very spirit of that terrible place.
It was not the convict. This man was far from the place where the
latter had disappeared. Besides, he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) was a much taller man. With a cry
of surprise I pointed him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) out to the baronet, but in the instant during
which I had turned to grasp his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) arm the man was gone. There was the
sharp pinnacle of granite still cutting the lower edge of the moon, but
its peak bore no trace of that silent and motionless figure.

<p/>I wished to go in that direction and to search the tor, but it was some
distance away. The baronet's nerves were still quivering from that cry,
which recalled the dark story of his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) family, and he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) was not in the mood
for fresh adventures. He (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) had not seen this lonely man upon the tor and
could not feel the thrill which his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) strange presence and his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) commanding
attitude had given to me. <div class="bookquote">``A warder, no doubt,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>said he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>). <div class="bookquote">``The moor
has been thick with them since this fellow escaped.''  (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div>Well, perhaps his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>)
explanation may be the right one, but I should like to have some further
proof of it. Today we mean to communicate to the Princetown people where
they should look for their missing man, but it is hard lines that
we have not actually had the triumph of bringing him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) back as our
own prisoner. Such are the adventures of last night, and you must
acknowledge, my dear Holmes, that I have done you very well in
the matter of a report. Much of what I tell you is no doubt quite
irrelevant, but still I feel that it is best that I should let you have
all the facts and leave you to select for yourself those which will
be of most service to you in helping you to your conclusions. We are
certainly making some progress. So far as the Barrymores go we have
found the motive of their actions, and that has cleared up the situation
very much. But the moor with its mysteries and its strange inhabitants
remains as inscrutable as ever. Perhaps in my next I may be able to
throw some light upon this also. Best of all would it be if you could
come down to us. In any case you will hear from me again in the course
of the next few days.




<p/>Chapter 10. Extract from the Diary of Dr. Watson



<p/>So far I have been able to quote from the reports which I have forwarded
during these early days to Sherlock Holmes. Now, however, I have arrived
at a point in my narrative where I am compelled to abandon this method
and to trust once more to my recollections, aided by the diary which
I kept at the time. A few extracts from the latter will carry me on to
those scenes which are indelibly fixed in every detail upon my memory. I
proceed, then, from the morning which followed our abortive chase of the
convict and our other strange experiences upon the moor.

<p/>October 16th. A dull and foggy day with a drizzle of rain. The house
is banked in with rolling clouds, which rise now and then to show the
dreary curves of the moor, with thin, silver veins upon the sides of the
hills, and the distant boulders gleaming where the light strikes upon
their wet faces. It is melancholy outside and in. The baronet is in a
black reaction after the excitements of the night. I am conscious myself
of a weight at my heart and a feeling of impending danger--ever present
danger, which is the more terrible because I am unable to define it.

<p/>And have I not cause for such a feeling? Consider the long sequence of
incidents which have all pointed to some sinister influence which is
at work around us. There is the death of the last occupant of the Hall,
fulfilling so exactly the conditions of the family legend, and there
are the repeated reports from peasants of the appearance of a strange
creature upon the moor. Twice I have with my own ears heard the sound
which resembled the distant baying of a hound. It is incredible,
impossible, that it should really be outside the ordinary laws of
nature. A spectral hound which leaves material footmarks and fills the
air with its howling is surely not to be thought of. Stapleton may
fall in with such a superstition, and Mortimer also, but if I have one
quality upon earth it is common sense, and nothing will persuade me to
believe in such a thing. To do so would be to descend to the level of
these poor peasants, who are not content with a mere fiend dog but must
needs describe him (<font color='blue'><b>fiend</b></font>) with hell-fire shooting from his (<font color='blue'><b>fiend</b></font>) mouth and eyes.
Holmes would not listen to such fancies, and I am his (<font color='blue'><b>Holmes</b></font>) agent. But facts
are facts, and I have twice heard this crying upon the moor. Suppose
that there were really some huge hound loose upon it; that would go far
to explain everything. But where could such a hound lie concealed, where
did it get its food, where did it come from, how was it that no one
saw it by day? It must be confessed that the natural explanation offers
almost as many difficulties as the other. And always, apart from the
hound, there is the fact of the human agency in London, the man in the
cab, and the letter which warned Sir Henry against the moor. This at
least was real, but it might have been the work of a protecting friend
as easily as of an enemy. Where is that friend or enemy now? Has he (<font color='blue'><b>friend</b></font>)
remained in London, or has he (<font color='blue'><b>friend</b></font>) followed us down here? Could he (<font color='blue'><b>friend</b></font>)--could he (<font color='blue'><b>friend</b></font>)
be the stranger whom I saw upon the tor?

<p/>It is true that I have had only the one glance at him (<font color='blue'><b>friend</b></font>), and yet there are
some things to which I am ready to swear. He (<font color='blue'><b>friend</b></font>) is no one whom I have seen
down here, and I have now met all the neighbours. The figure was far
taller than that of Stapleton, far thinner than that of Frankland.
Barrymore it might possibly have been, but we had left him (<font color='blue'><b>Frankland</b></font>) behind us,
and I am certain that he (<font color='blue'><b>Frankland</b></font>) could not have followed us. A stranger then is
still dogging us, just as a stranger dogged us in London. We have never
shaken him (<font color='blue'><b>stranger</b></font>) off. If I could lay my hands upon that man, then at last we
might find ourselves at the end of all our difficulties. To this one
purpose I must now devote all my energies.

<p/>My first impulse was to tell Sir Henry all my plans. My second and
wisest one is to play my own game and speak as little as possible to
anyone. He (<font color='blue'><b>Henry</b></font>) is silent and distrait. His (<font color='blue'><b>Henry</b></font>) nerves have been strangely shaken
by that sound upon the moor. I will say nothing to add to his (<font color='blue'><b>Henry</b></font>) anxieties,
but I will take my own steps to attain my own end.

<p/>We had a small scene this morning after breakfast. Barrymore asked leave
to speak with Sir Henry, and they were closeted in his (<font color='blue'><b>Henry</b></font>) study some little
time. Sitting in the billiard-room I more than once heard the sound of
voices raised, and I had a pretty good idea what the point was which was
under discussion. After a time the baronet opened his (<font color='blue'><b>Henry</b></font>) door and called
for me. <div class="bookquote">``Barrymore considers that he (<font color='blue'><b>fellow</b></font>) has a grievance,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Henry</b></font>) said. <div class="bookquote">``He (<font color='blue'><b>fellow</b></font>)
thinks that it was unfair on our part to hunt his (<font color='blue'><b>fellow</b></font>) brother-in-law down
when he (<font color='blue'><b>fellow</b></font>), of his (<font color='blue'><b>fellow</b></font>) own free will, had told us the secret.''

 (<font color='red'><b>The butler</b></font>)</div><p/>The butler was standing very pale but very collected before us.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``I may have spoken too warmly, sir,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>said he (<font color='blue'><b>Henry</b></font>), <div class="bookquote">``and if I have, I am sure
that I beg your pardon. At the same time, I was very much surprised when
I heard you two gentlemen come back this morning and learned that you
had been chasing Selden. The poor fellow has enough to fight against
without my putting more upon his (<font color='blue'><b>fellow</b></font>) track.''

 (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``If you had told us of your own free will it would have been a different
thing,''  (<font color='red'><b>the baronet</b></font>)</div>said the baronet, <div class="bookquote">``you only told us, or rather your wife only
told us, when it was forced from you and you could not help yourself.''

 (<font color='red'><b>the baronet</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I didn't think you would have taken advantage of it, Sir Henry--indeed
I didn't.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``The man is a public danger. There are lonely houses scattered over the
moor, and he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) is a fellow who would stick at nothing. You only want to
get a glimpse of his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) face to see that. Look at Mr. Stapleton's house,
for example, with no one but himself to defend it. There's no safety for
anyone until he (<font color='blue'><b>Stapleton</b></font>) is under lock and key.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``He (<font color='blue'><b>Stapleton</b></font>)'ll break into no house, sir. I give you my solemn word upon that.
But he (<font color='blue'><b>Stapleton</b></font>) will never trouble anyone in this country again. I assure you,
Sir Henry, that in a very few days the necessary arrangements will have
been made and he (<font color='blue'><b>Henry</b></font>) will be on his (<font color='blue'><b>Henry</b></font>) way to South America. For God's sake,
sir, I beg of you not to let the police know that he (<font color='blue'><b>Henry</b></font>) is still on the
moor. They have given up the chase there, and he (<font color='blue'><b>Henry</b></font>) can lie quiet until the
ship is ready for him (<font color='blue'><b>Henry</b></font>). You can't tell on him (<font color='blue'><b>Henry</b></font>) without getting my wife and
me into trouble. I beg you, sir, to say nothing to the police.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``What do you say, Watson?''

 (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div><p/>I shrugged my shoulders. <div class="bookquote">``If he (<font color='blue'><b>Watson</b></font>) were safely out of the country it would
relieve the tax-payer of a burden.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``But how about the chance of his (<font color='blue'><b>Watson</b></font>) holding someone up before he (<font color='blue'><b>Watson</b></font>) goes?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``He (<font color='blue'><b>Watson</b></font>) would not do anything so mad, sir. We have provided him (<font color='blue'><b>Watson</b></font>) with all
that he (<font color='blue'><b>Watson</b></font>) can want. To commit a crime would be to show where he (<font color='blue'><b>Watson</b></font>) was
hiding.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``That is true,''  (<font color='red'><b>Henry/Henry Baskerville/Baskerville</b></font>)</div>said Sir Henry. <div class="bookquote">``Well, Barrymore--''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``God bless you, sir, and thank you from my heart! It would have killed
my poor wife had he (<font color='blue'><b>God</b></font>) been taken again.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I guess we are aiding and abetting a felony, Watson? But, after what
we have heard I don't feel as if I could give the man up, so there is an
end of it. All right, Barrymore, you can go.''

 (<font color='red'><b>the man</b></font>)</div><p/>With a few broken words of gratitude the man turned, but he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) hesitated
and then came back.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``You've been so kind to us, sir, that I should like to do the best I
can for you in return. I know something, Sir Henry, and perhaps I should
have said it before, but it was long after the inquest that I found it
out. I've never breathed a word about it yet to mortal man. It's about
poor Sir Charles's death.''

 (<font color='red'><b>The baronet</b></font>)</div><p/>The baronet and I were both upon our feet. <div class="bookquote">``Do you know how he (<font color='blue'><b>Charles</b></font>) died?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``No, sir, I don't know that.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``What then?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I know why he (<font color='blue'><b>Charles</b></font>) was at the gate at that hour. It was to meet a woman.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``To meet a woman! He (<font color='blue'><b>Charles</b></font>)?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Yes, sir.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``And the woman's name?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I can't give you the name, sir, but I can give you the initials. Her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>)
initials were L. L.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``How do you know this, Barrymore?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Well, Sir Henry, your uncle had a letter that morning. He (<font color='blue'><b>Henry</b></font>) had usually a
great many letters, for he (<font color='blue'><b>Henry</b></font>) was a public man and well known for his (<font color='blue'><b>Henry</b></font>) kind
heart, so that everyone who was in trouble was glad to turn to him (<font color='blue'><b>Henry</b></font>). But
that morning, as it chanced, there was only this one letter, so I took
the more notice of it. It was from Coombe Tracey, and it was addressed
in a woman's hand.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Well?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Well, sir, I thought no more of the matter, and never would have done
had it not been for my wife. Only a few weeks ago she (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>) was cleaning out
Sir Charles's study--it had never been touched since his (<font color='blue'><b>Charles</b></font>) death--and she (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>)
found the ashes of a burned letter in the back of the grate. The greater
part of it was charred to pieces, but one little slip, the end of a
page, hung together, and the writing could still be read, though it was
gray on a black ground. It seemed to us to be a postscript at the end
of the letter and it said: `Please, please, as you are a gentleman, burn
this letter, and be at the gate by ten o clock. Beneath it were signed
the initials L. L.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Have you got that slip?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``No, sir, it crumbled all to bits after we moved it.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Had Sir Charles received any other letters in the same writing?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Well, sir, I took no particular notice of his (<font color='blue'><b>Charles</b></font>) letters. I should not
have noticed this one, only it happened to come alone.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``And you have no idea who L. L. is?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``No, sir. No more than you have. But I expect if we could lay our hands
upon that lady we should know more about Sir Charles's death.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I cannot understand, Barrymore, how you came to conceal this important
information.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Well, sir, it was immediately after that our own trouble came to us.
And then again, sir, we were both of us very fond of Sir Charles, as we
well might be considering all that he (<font color='blue'><b>Charles</b></font>) has done for us. To rake this
up couldn't help our poor master, and it's well to go carefully when
there's a lady in the case. Even the best of us--''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``You thought it might injure his (<font color='blue'><b>master</b></font>) reputation?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Well, sir, I thought no good could come of it. But now you have been
kind to us, and I feel as if it would be treating you unfairly not to
tell you all that I know about the matter.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Very good, Barrymore; you can go.''  (<font color='red'><b>the butler</b></font>)</div>When the butler had left us Sir
Henry turned to me. <div class="bookquote">``Well, Watson, what do you think of this new light?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``It seems to leave the darkness rather blacker than before.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``So I think. But if we can only trace L. L. it should clear up the whole
business. We have gained that much. We know that there is someone who
has the facts if we can only find her (<font color='blue'><b>Barrymore</b></font>). What do you think we should do?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Let Holmes know all about it at once. It will give him (<font color='blue'><b>Holmes</b></font>) the clue for
which he (<font color='blue'><b>Holmes</b></font>) has been seeking. I am much mistaken if it does not bring him (<font color='blue'><b>Holmes</b></font>)
down.''

 (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div><p/>I went at once to my room and drew up my report of the morning's
conversation for Holmes. It was evident to me that he (<font color='blue'><b>Holmes</b></font>) had been very busy
of late, for the notes which I had from Baker Street were few and short,
with no comments upon the information which I had supplied and hardly
any reference to my mission. No doubt his (<font color='blue'><b>Baker</b></font>) blackmailing case is absorbing
all his (<font color='blue'><b>Baker</b></font>) faculties. And yet this new factor must surely arrest his (<font color='blue'><b>Baker</b></font>)
attention and renew his (<font color='blue'><b>Baker</b></font>) interest. I wish that he (<font color='blue'><b>Baker</b></font>) were here.

<p/>October 17th. All day today the rain poured down, rustling on the ivy
and dripping from the eaves. I thought of the convict out upon the
bleak, cold, shelterless moor. Poor devil! Whatever his (<font color='blue'><b>devil</b></font>) crimes, he (<font color='blue'><b>devil</b></font>) has
suffered something to atone for them. And then I thought of that other
one--the face in the cab, the figure against the moon. Was he (<font color='blue'><b>devil</b></font>) also out
in that deluged--the unseen watcher, the man of darkness? In the evening
I put on my waterproof and I walked far upon the sodden moor, full of
dark imaginings, the rain beating upon my face and the wind whistling
about my ears. God help those who wander into the great mire now, for
even the firm uplands are becoming a morass. I found the black tor upon
which I had seen the solitary watcher, and from its craggy summit I
looked out myself across the melancholy downs. Rain squalls drifted
across their russet face, and the heavy, slate-coloured clouds hung
low over the landscape, trailing in gray wreaths down the sides of the
fantastic hills. In the distant hollow on the left, half hidden by the
mist, the two thin towers of Baskerville Hall rose above the trees. They
were the only signs of human life which I could see, save only those
prehistoric huts which lay thickly upon the slopes of the hills. Nowhere
was there any trace of that lonely man whom I had seen on the same spot
two nights before.

<p/>As I walked back I was overtaken by Dr. Mortimer driving in his (<font color='blue'><b>Mortimer</b></font>) dog-cart
over a rough moorland track which led from the outlying farmhouse of
Foulmire. He (<font color='blue'><b>Mortimer</b></font>) has been very attentive to us, and hardly a day has passed
that he (<font color='blue'><b>Mortimer</b></font>) has not called at the Hall to see how we were getting on. He (<font color='blue'><b>Mortimer</b></font>)
insisted upon my climbing into his (<font color='blue'><b>Mortimer</b></font>) dog-cart, and he (<font color='blue'><b>Mortimer</b></font>) gave me a lift
homeward. I found him (<font color='blue'><b>Mortimer</b></font>) much troubled over the disappearance of his (<font color='blue'><b>Mortimer</b></font>) little
spaniel. It had wandered on to the moor and had never come back. I
gave him (<font color='blue'><b>Mortimer</b></font>) such consolation as I might, but I thought of the pony on the
Grimpen Mire, and I do not fancy that he (<font color='blue'><b>Mortimer</b></font>) will see his (<font color='blue'><b>Mortimer</b></font>) little dog again.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``By the way, Mortimer,''  (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div>said I as we jolted along the rough road, <div class="bookquote">``I
suppose there are few people living within driving distance of this whom
you do not know?''

 (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Hardly any, I think.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Can you, then, tell me the name of any woman whose initials are L. L.?''

 (<font color='red'><b>He</b></font>)</div><p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Mortimer</b></font>) thought for a few minutes.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``No,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>said he (<font color='blue'><b>Mortimer</b></font>). <div class="bookquote">``There are a few gipsies and labouring folk for whom
I can't answer, but among the farmers or gentry there is no one whose
initials are those. Wait a bit though,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Mortimer</b></font>) added after a pause. <div class="bookquote">``There
is Laura Lyons--her (<font color='blue'><b>Lyons</b></font>) initials are L. L.--but she (<font color='blue'><b>Lyons</b></font>) lives in Coombe Tracey.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Who is she (<font color='blue'><b>Lyons</b></font>)?''  (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div>I asked.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``She (<font color='blue'><b>Lyons</b></font>) is Frankland's daughter.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``What! Old Frankland the crank?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Exactly. She (<font color='blue'><b>Lyons</b></font>) married an artist named Lyons, who came sketching on the
moor. He (<font color='blue'><b>artist</b></font>) proved to be a blackguard and deserted her (<font color='blue'><b>Lyons</b></font>). The fault from what
I hear may not have been entirely on one side. Her (<font color='blue'><b>Lyons</b></font>) father refused to
have anything to do with her (<font color='blue'><b>Lyons</b></font>) because she (<font color='blue'><b>Lyons</b></font>) had married without his (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) consent
and perhaps for one or two other reasons as well. So, between the old
sinner and the young one the girl has had a pretty bad time.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``How does she (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) live?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I fancy old Frankland allows her (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) a pittance, but it cannot be more,
for his (<font color='blue'><b>Frankland</b></font>) own affairs are considerably involved. Whatever she (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) may have
deserved one could not allow her (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) to go hopelessly to the bad. Her (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) story
got about, and several of the people here did something to enable her (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>)
to earn an honest living. Stapleton did for one, and Sir Charles for
another. I gave a trifle myself. It was to set her (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) up in a typewriting
business.''

 (<font color='red'><b>He</b></font>)</div><p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Mortimer</b></font>) wanted to know the object of my inquiries, but I managed to satisfy
his (<font color='blue'><b>Mortimer</b></font>) curiosity without telling him (<font color='blue'><b>Mortimer</b></font>) too much, for there is no reason why
we should take anyone into our confidence. Tomorrow morning I shall
find my way to Coombe Tracey, and if I can see this Mrs. Laura Lyons, of
equivocal reputation, a long step will have been made towards clearing
one incident in this chain of mysteries. I am certainly developing the
wisdom of the serpent, for when Mortimer pressed his (<font color='blue'><b>Mortimer</b></font>) questions to an
inconvenient extent I asked him (<font color='blue'><b>Mortimer</b></font>) casually to what type Frankland's skull
belonged, and so heard nothing but craniology for the rest of our drive.
I have not lived for years with Sherlock Holmes for nothing.

<p/>I have only one other incident to record upon this tempestuous and
melancholy day. This was my conversation with Barrymore just now, which
gives me one more strong card which I can play in due time.

<p/>Mortimer had stayed to dinner, and he (<font color='blue'><b>Mortimer</b></font>) and the baronet played ecarte
afterwards. The butler brought me my coffee into the library, and I took
the chance to ask him (<font color='blue'><b>butler</b></font>) a few questions.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Well,''  (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div>said I, <div class="bookquote">``has this precious relation of yours departed, or is he (<font color='blue'><b>Charles</b></font>)
still lurking out yonder?''

 (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I don't know, sir. I hope to heaven that he (<font color='blue'><b>Charles</b></font>) has gone, for he (<font color='blue'><b>Charles</b></font>) has
brought nothing but trouble here! I've not heard of him (<font color='blue'><b>Charles</b></font>) since I left out
food for him (<font color='blue'><b>Charles</b></font>) last, and that was three days ago.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Did you see him (<font color='blue'><b>Charles</b></font>) then?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``No, sir, but the food was gone when next I went that way.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Then he (<font color='blue'><b>Charles</b></font>) was certainly there?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``So you would think, sir, unless it was the other man who took it.''

 (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div><p/>I sat with my coffee-cup halfway to my lips and stared at Barrymore.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``You know that there is another man then?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Yes, sir; there is another man upon the moor.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Have you seen him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>)?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``No, sir.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``How do you know of him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) then?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Selden told me of him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>), sir, a week ago or more. He (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>)'s in hiding, too,
but he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>)'s not a convict as far as I can make out. I don't like it, Dr.
Watson--I tell you straight, sir, that I don't like it.''  (<font color='red'><b>He</b></font>)</div>He (<font color='blue'><b>butler</b></font>) spoke with a
sudden passion of earnestness.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Now, listen to me, Barrymore! I have no interest in this matter but
that of your master. I have come here with no object except to help him (<font color='blue'><b>master</b></font>).
Tell me, frankly, what it is that you don't like.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Barrymore/Mrs. Barrymore</b></font>)</div><p/>Barrymore hesitated for a moment, as if he (<font color='blue'><b>butler</b></font>) regretted his (<font color='blue'><b>butler</b></font>) outburst or
found it difficult to express his (<font color='blue'><b>butler</b></font>) own feelings in words.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``It's all these goings-on, sir,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>butler</b></font>) cried at last, waving his (<font color='blue'><b>butler</b></font>) hand
towards the rain-lashed window which faced the moor. <div class="bookquote">``There's foul play
somewhere, and there's black villainy brewing, to that I'll swear!
Very glad I should be, sir, to see Sir Henry on his (<font color='blue'><b>Henry</b></font>) way back to London
again!''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``But what is it that alarms you?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Look at Sir Charles's death! That was bad enough, for all that the
coroner said. Look at the noises on the moor at night. There's not a
man would cross it after sundown if he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) was paid for it. Look at this
stranger hiding out yonder, and watching and waiting! What's he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) waiting
for? What does it mean? It means no good to anyone of the name of
Baskerville, and very glad I shall be to be quit of it all on the day
that Sir Henry's new servants are ready to take over the Hall.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``But about this stranger,''  (<font color='red'><b>I.</b></font>)</div>said I. <div class="bookquote">``Can you tell me anything about
him (<font color='blue'><b>stranger</b></font>)? What did Selden say? Did he (<font color='blue'><b>stranger</b></font>) find out where he (<font color='blue'><b>stranger</b></font>) hid, or what he (<font color='blue'><b>stranger</b></font>) was
doing?''

 (<font color='red'><b>I.</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``He (<font color='blue'><b>stranger</b></font>) saw him (<font color='blue'><b>stranger</b></font>) once or twice, but he (<font color='blue'><b>stranger</b></font>) is a deep one and gives nothing away.
At first he (<font color='blue'><b>stranger</b></font>) thought that he (<font color='blue'><b>stranger</b></font>) was the police, but soon he (<font color='blue'><b>stranger</b></font>) found that he (<font color='blue'><b>stranger</b></font>)
had some lay of his (<font color='blue'><b>stranger</b></font>) own. A kind of gentleman he (<font color='blue'><b>stranger</b></font>) was, as far as he (<font color='blue'><b>stranger</b></font>) could
see, but what he (<font color='blue'><b>stranger</b></font>) was doing he (<font color='blue'><b>stranger</b></font>) could not make out.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``And where did he (<font color='blue'><b>stranger</b></font>) say that he (<font color='blue'><b>stranger</b></font>) lived?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Among the old houses on the hillside--the stone huts where the old folk
used to live.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``But how about his (<font color='blue'><b>stranger</b></font>) food?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Selden found out that he (<font color='blue'><b>stranger</b></font>) has got a lad who works for him (<font color='blue'><b>stranger</b></font>) and brings all
he (<font color='blue'><b>stranger</b></font>) needs. I dare say he (<font color='blue'><b>stranger</b></font>) goes to Coombe Tracey for what he (<font color='blue'><b>stranger</b></font>) wants.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Very good, Barrymore. We may talk further of this some other time.''
 (<font color='red'><b>the butler</b></font>)</div>When the butler had gone I walked over to the black window, and I looked
through a blurred pane at the driving clouds and at the tossing outline
of the wind-swept trees. It is a wild night indoors, and what must it
be in a stone hut upon the moor. What passion of hatred can it be which
leads a man to lurk in such a place at such a time! And what deep and
earnest purpose can he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) have which calls for such a trial! There, in that
hut upon the moor, seems to lie the very centre of that problem which
has vexed me so sorely. I swear that another day shall not have passed
before I have done all that man can do to reach the heart of the
mystery.




<p/>Chapter 11. The Man on the Tor



<p/>The extract from my private diary which forms the last chapter has
brought my narrative up to the eighteenth of October, a time when these
strange events began to move swiftly towards their terrible conclusion.
The incidents of the next few days are indelibly graven upon my
recollection, and I can tell them without reference to the notes made
at the time. I start them from the day which succeeded that upon which
I had established two facts of great importance, the one that Mrs. Laura
Lyons of Coombe Tracey had written to Sir Charles Baskerville and made
an appointment with him (<font color='blue'><b>Baskerville</b></font>) at the very place and hour that he (<font color='blue'><b>Baskerville</b></font>) met his (<font color='blue'><b>Baskerville</b></font>)
death, the other that the lurking man upon the moor was to be found
among the stone huts upon the hillside. With these two facts in my
possession I felt that either my intelligence or my courage must be
deficient if I could not throw some further light upon these dark
places.

<p/>I had no opportunity to tell the baronet what I had learned about Mrs.
Lyons upon the evening before, for Dr. Mortimer remained with him (<font color='blue'><b>Mortimer</b></font>) at
cards until it was very late. At breakfast, however, I informed him (<font color='blue'><b>Mortimer</b></font>)
about my discovery and asked him (<font color='blue'><b>Mortimer</b></font>) whether he (<font color='blue'><b>Mortimer</b></font>) would care to accompany
me to Coombe Tracey. At first he (<font color='blue'><b>Mortimer</b></font>) was very eager to come, but on second
thoughts it seemed to both of us that if I went alone the results might
be better. The more formal we made the visit the less information we
might obtain. I left Sir Henry behind, therefore, not without some
prickings of conscience, and drove off upon my new quest.

<p/>When I reached Coombe Tracey I told Perkins to put up the horses, and
I made inquiries for the lady whom I had come to interrogate. I had no
difficulty in finding her (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) rooms, which were central and well appointed.
A maid showed me in without ceremony, and as I entered the sitting-room
a lady, who was sitting before a Remington typewriter, sprang up with a
pleasant smile of welcome. Her (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) face fell, however, when she (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) saw that
I was a stranger, and she (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) sat down again and asked me the object of my
visit.

<p/>The first impression left by Mrs. Lyons was one of extreme beauty. Her (<font color='blue'><b>Lyons</b></font>)
eyes and hair were of the same rich hazel colour, and her (<font color='blue'><b>Lyons</b></font>) cheeks, though
considerably freckled, were flushed with the exquisite bloom of the
brunette, the dainty pink which lurks at the heart of the sulphur rose.
Admiration was, I repeat, the first impression. But the second was
criticism. There was something subtly wrong with the face, some
coarseness of expression, some hardness, perhaps, of eye, some looseness
of lip which marred its perfect beauty. But these, of course, are
afterthoughts. At the moment I was simply conscious that I was in
the presence of a very handsome woman, and that she (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) was asking me the
reasons for my visit. I had not quite understood until that instant how
delicate my mission was.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``I have the pleasure,''  (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div>said I, <div class="bookquote">``of knowing your father.''

 (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div><p/>It was a clumsy introduction, and the lady made me feel it. <div class="bookquote">``There
is nothing in common between my father and me,''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) said. <div class="bookquote">``I owe him (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>)
nothing, and his (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) friends are not mine. If it were not for the late Sir
Charles Baskerville and some other kind hearts I might have starved for
all that my father cared.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``It was about the late Sir Charles Baskerville that I have come here to
see you.''

 (<font color='red'><b>the lady</b></font>)</div><p/>The freckles started out on the lady's face.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``What can I tell you about him (<font color='blue'><b>Baskerville</b></font>)?''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) asked, and her (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) fingers played
nervously over the stops of her (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) typewriter.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``You knew him (<font color='blue'><b>Baskerville</b></font>), did you not?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I have already said that I owe a great deal to his (<font color='blue'><b>Baskerville</b></font>) kindness. If I am
able to support myself it is largely due to the interest which he (<font color='blue'><b>Baskerville</b></font>) took
in my unhappy situation.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Did you correspond with him (<font color='blue'><b>Baskerville</b></font>)?''

 (<font color='red'><b>The lady</b></font>)</div><p/>The lady looked quickly up with an angry gleam in her (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) hazel eyes.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``What is the object of these questions?''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) asked sharply.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``The object is to avoid a public scandal. It is better that I should ask
them here than that the matter should pass outside our control.''

 (<font color='red'><b>She</b></font>)</div><p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) was silent and her (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) face was still very pale. At last she (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) looked up
with something reckless and defiant in her (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) manner.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Well, I'll answer,''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) said. <div class="bookquote">``What are your questions?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Did you correspond with Sir Charles?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I certainly wrote to him (<font color='blue'><b>Charles</b></font>) once or twice to acknowledge his (<font color='blue'><b>Charles</b></font>) delicacy and
his (<font color='blue'><b>Charles</b></font>) generosity.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Have you the dates of those letters?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``No.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Have you ever met him (<font color='blue'><b>Charles</b></font>)?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Yes, once or twice, when he (<font color='blue'><b>Charles</b></font>) came into Coombe Tracey. He (<font color='blue'><b>Charles</b></font>) was a very
retiring man, and he (<font color='blue'><b>Charles</b></font>) preferred to do good by stealth.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``But if you saw him (<font color='blue'><b>Charles</b></font>) so seldom and wrote so seldom, how did he (<font color='blue'><b>Charles</b></font>) know
enough about your affairs to be able to help you, as you say that he (<font color='blue'><b>Charles</b></font>) has
done?''

 (<font color='red'><b>She</b></font>)</div><p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) met my difficulty with the utmost readiness.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``There were several gentlemen who knew my sad history and united to
help me. One was Mr. Stapleton, a neighbour and intimate friend of Sir
Charles's. He (<font color='blue'><b>Charles</b></font>) was exceedingly kind, and it was through him (<font color='blue'><b>Charles</b></font>) that Sir
Charles learned about my affairs.''

 (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div><p/>I knew already that Sir Charles Baskerville had made Stapleton his (<font color='blue'><b>Baskerville</b></font>)
almoner upon several occasions, so the lady's statement bore the impress
of truth upon it.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Did you ever write to Sir Charles asking him (<font color='blue'><b>Charles</b></font>) to meet you?''  (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div>I continued.

<p/>Mrs. Lyons flushed with anger again. <div class="bookquote">``Really, sir, this is a very
extraordinary question.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I am sorry, madam, but I must repeat it.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Then I answer, certainly not.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Not on the very day of Sir Charles's death?''

 (<font color='red'><b>me</b></font>)</div><p/>The flush had faded in an instant, and a deathly face was before me. Her (<font color='blue'><b>Lyons</b></font>)
dry lips could not speak the <div class="bookquote">``No''  (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div>which I saw rather than heard.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Surely your memory deceives you,''  (<font color='red'><b>I.</b></font>)</div>said I. ``I could even quote a passage
of your letter. It ran `Please, please, as you are a gentleman, burn
this letter, and be at the gate by ten o’clock.'''

<p/>I thought that she (<font color='blue'><b>madam</b></font>) had fainted, but she (<font color='blue'><b>madam</b></font>) recovered herself by a supreme
effort.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Is there no such thing as a gentleman?''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Lyons</b></font>) gasped.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``You do Sir Charles an injustice. He (<font color='blue'><b>Charles</b></font>) did burn the letter. But sometimes
a letter may be legible even when burned. You acknowledge now that you
wrote it?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Yes, I did write it,''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Lyons</b></font>) cried, pouring out her (<font color='blue'><b>Lyons</b></font>) soul in a torrent of
words. <div class="bookquote">``I did write it. Why should I deny it? I have no reason to be
ashamed of it. I wished him (<font color='blue'><b>Charles</b></font>) to help me. I believed that if I had an
interview I could gain his (<font color='blue'><b>Charles</b></font>) help, so I asked him (<font color='blue'><b>Charles</b></font>) to meet me.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``But why at such an hour?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Because I had only just learned that he (<font color='blue'><b>Charles</b></font>) was going to London next day
and might be away for months. There were reasons why I could not get
there earlier.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``But why a rendezvous in the garden instead of a visit to the house?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Do you think a woman could go alone at that hour to a bachelor's
house?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Well, what happened when you did get there?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I never went.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Mrs. Lyons!''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``No, I swear it to you on all I hold sacred. I never went. Something
intervened to prevent my going.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``What was that?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``That is a private matter. I cannot tell it.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``You acknowledge then that you made an appointment with Sir Charles at
the very hour and place at which he (<font color='blue'><b>Charles</b></font>) met his (<font color='blue'><b>Charles</b></font>) death, but you deny that you
kept the appointment.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``That is the truth.''

 (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div><p/>Again and again I cross-questioned her (<font color='blue'><b>Lyons</b></font>), but I could never get past that
point.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Mrs. Lyons,''  (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div>said I as I rose from this long and inconclusive
interview, <div class="bookquote">``you are taking a very great responsibility and putting
yourself in a very false position by not making an absolutely clean
breast of all that you know. If I have to call in the aid of the police
you will find how seriously you are compromised. If your position is
innocent, why did you in the first instance deny having written to Sir
Charles upon that date?''

 (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Because I feared that some false conclusion might be drawn from it and
that I might find myself involved in a scandal.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``And why were you so pressing that Sir Charles should destroy your
letter?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``If you have read the letter you will know.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I did not say that I had read all the letter.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``You quoted some of it.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I quoted the postscript. The letter had, as I said, been burned and it
was not all legible. I ask you once again why it was that you were so
pressing that Sir Charles should destroy this letter which he (<font color='blue'><b>Charles</b></font>) received
on the day of his (<font color='blue'><b>Charles</b></font>) death.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``The matter is a very private one.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``The more reason why you should avoid a public investigation.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I will tell you, then. If you have heard anything of my unhappy history
you will know that I made a rash marriage and had reason to regret it.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I have heard so much.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``My life has been one incessant persecution from a husband whom I abhor.
The law is upon his (<font color='blue'><b>husband</b></font>) side, and every day I am faced by the possibility
that he (<font color='blue'><b>husband</b></font>) may force me to live with him (<font color='blue'><b>husband</b></font>). At the time that I wrote this
letter to Sir Charles I had learned that there was a prospect of
my regaining my freedom if certain expenses could be met. It meant
everything to me--peace of mind, happiness, self-respect--everything. I
knew Sir Charles's generosity, and I thought that if he (<font color='blue'><b>Charles</b></font>) heard the story
from my own lips he (<font color='blue'><b>Charles</b></font>) would help me.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Then how is it that you did not go?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Because I received help in the interval from another source.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Why then, did you not write to Sir Charles and explain this?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``So I should have done had I not seen his (<font color='blue'><b>Charles</b></font>) death in the paper next
morning.''

 (<font color='red'><b>The woman</b></font>)</div><p/>The woman's story hung coherently together, and all my questions were
unable to shake it. I could only check it by finding if she (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) had, indeed,
instituted divorce proceedings against her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) husband at or about the time
of the tragedy.

<p/>It was unlikely that she (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) would dare to say that she (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) had not been to
Baskerville Hall if she (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) really had been, for a trap would be necessary
to take her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) there, and could not have returned to Coombe Tracey until
the early hours of the morning. Such an excursion could not be kept
secret. The probability was, therefore, that she (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) was telling the truth,
or, at least, a part of the truth. I came away baffled and disheartened.
Once again I had reached that dead wall which seemed to be built across
every path by which I tried to get at the object of my mission. And yet
the more I thought of the lady's face and of her (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) manner the more I felt
that something was being held back from me. Why should she (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) turn so pale?
Why should she (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) fight against every admission until it was forced from
her (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>)? Why should she (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) have been so reticent at the time of the tragedy?
Surely the explanation of all this could not be as innocent as she (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>)
would have me believe. For the moment I could proceed no farther in that
direction, but must turn back to that other clue which was to be sought
for among the stone huts upon the moor.

<p/>And that was a most vague direction. I realized it as I drove back
and noted how hill after hill showed traces of the ancient people.
Barrymore's only indication had been that the stranger lived in one of
these abandoned huts, and many hundreds of them are scattered throughout
the length and breadth of the moor. But I had my own experience for a
guide since it had shown me the man himself standing upon the summit of
the Black Tor. That, then, should be the centre of my search. From there
I should explore every hut upon the moor until I lighted upon the right
one. If this man were inside it I should find out from his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) own lips, at
the point of my revolver if necessary, who he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) was and why he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) had dogged
us so long. He (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) might slip away from us in the crowd of Regent Street,
but it would puzzle him (<font color='blue'><b>Regent</b></font>) to do so upon the lonely moor. On the other
hand, if I should find the hut and its tenant should not be within it I
must remain there, however long the vigil, until he (<font color='blue'><b>Regent</b></font>) returned. Holmes had
missed him (<font color='blue'><b>Holmes</b></font>) in London. It would indeed be a triumph for me if I could run
him (<font color='blue'><b>Holmes</b></font>) to earth where my master had failed.

<p/>Luck had been against us again and again in this inquiry, but now at
last it came to my aid. And the messenger of good fortune was none other
than Mr. Frankland, who was standing, gray-whiskered and red-faced,
outside the gate of his (<font color='blue'><b>Frankland</b></font>) garden, which opened on to the highroad along
which I travelled.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Good-day, Dr. Watson,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>cried he (<font color='blue'><b>Frankland</b></font>) with unwonted good humour, <div class="bookquote">``you must
really give your horses a rest and come in to have a glass of wine and
to congratulate me.''

 (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div><p/>My feelings towards him (<font color='blue'><b>Frankland</b></font>) were very far from being friendly after what I
had heard of his (<font color='blue'><b>Frankland</b></font>) treatment of his (<font color='blue'><b>Frankland</b></font>) daughter, but I was anxious to send
Perkins and the wagonette home, and the opportunity was a good one. I
alighted and sent a message to Sir Henry that I should walk over in time
for dinner. Then I followed Frankland into his (<font color='blue'><b>Frankland</b></font>) dining-room.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``It is a great day for me, sir--one of the red-letter days of my life,''
 (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Frankland</b></font>) cried with many chuckles. <div class="bookquote">``I have brought off a double event. I mean
to teach them in these parts that law is law, and that there is a man
here who does not fear to invoke it. I have established a right of way
through the centre of old Middleton's park, slap across it, sir, within
a hundred yards of his (<font color='blue'><b>Middleton</b></font>) own front door. What do you think of that? We'll
teach these magnates that they cannot ride roughshod over the rights
of the commoners, confound them! And I've closed the wood where the
Fernworthy folk used to picnic. These infernal people seem to think that
there are no rights of property, and that they can swarm where they like
with their papers and their bottles. Both cases decided, Dr. Watson, and
both in my favour. I haven't had such a day since I had Sir John Morland
for trespass because he (<font color='blue'><b>John</b></font>) shot in his (<font color='blue'><b>John</b></font>) own warren.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``How on earth did you do that?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Look it up in the books, sir. It will repay reading--Frankland v.
Morland, Court of Queen's Bench. It cost me 200 pounds, but I got my
verdict.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Did it do you any good?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``None, sir, none. I am proud to say that I had no interest in the
matter. I act entirely from a sense of public duty. I have no doubt, for
example, that the Fernworthy people will burn me in effigy tonight.
I told the police last time they did it that they should stop these
disgraceful exhibitions. The County Constabulary is in a scandalous
state, sir, and it has not afforded me the protection to which I am
entitled. The case of Frankland v. Regina will bring the matter before
the attention of the public. I told them that they would have occasion
to regret their treatment of me, and already my words have come true.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``How so?''  (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div>I asked.

<p/>The old man put on a very knowing expression. <div class="bookquote">``Because I could tell them
what they are dying to know; but nothing would induce me to help the
rascals in any way.''

 (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div><p/>I had been casting round for some excuse by which I could get away
from his (<font color='blue'><b>Frankland</b></font>) gossip, but now I began to wish to hear more of it. I had seen
enough of the contrary nature of the old sinner to understand that any
strong sign of interest would be the surest way to stop his (<font color='blue'><b>sinner</b></font>) confidences.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Some poaching case, no doubt?''  (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div>said I with an indifferent manner.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Ha, ha, my boy, a very much more important matter than that! What about
the convict on the moor?''

 (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div><p/>I stared. <div class="bookquote">``You don't mean that you know where he (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>) is?''  (<font color='red'><b>I.</b></font>)</div>said I.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``I may not know exactly where he (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>) is, but I am quite sure that I could
help the police to lay their hands on him (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>). Has it never struck you that
the way to catch that man was to find out where he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) got his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) food and so
trace it to him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>)?''

 (<font color='red'><b>I.</b></font>)</div><p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>sinner</b></font>) certainly seemed to be getting uncomfortably near the truth. <div class="bookquote">``No
doubt,''  (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div>said I; <div class="bookquote">``but how do you know that he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) is anywhere upon the moor?''

 (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I know it because I have seen with my own eyes the messenger who takes
him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) food.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Barrymore/Mrs. Barrymore</b></font>)</div><p/>My heart sank for Barrymore. It was a serious thing to be in the power
of this spiteful old busybody. But his (<font color='blue'><b>sinner</b></font>) next remark took a weight from my
mind.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``You'll be surprised to hear that his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) food is taken to him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) by a child.
I see him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) every day through my telescope upon the roof. He (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) passes along
the same path at the same hour, and to whom should he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) be going except to
the convict?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/>Here was luck indeed! And yet I suppressed all appearance of interest. A
child! Barrymore had said that our unknown was supplied by a boy. It was
on his (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>) track, and not upon the convict's, that Frankland had stumbled.
If I could get his (<font color='blue'><b>Frankland</b></font>) knowledge it might save me a long and weary hunt. But
incredulity and indifference were evidently my strongest cards.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``I should say that it was much more likely that it was the son of one of
the moorland shepherds taking out his (<font color='blue'><b>son</b></font>) father's dinner.''

 (<font color='red'><b>the autocrat</b></font>)</div><p/>The least appearance of opposition struck fire out of the old autocrat.
His (<font color='blue'><b>autocrat</b></font>) eyes looked malignantly at me, and his (<font color='blue'><b>autocrat</b></font>) gray whiskers bristled like
those of an angry cat.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Indeed, sir!''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>said he (<font color='blue'><b>autocrat</b></font>), pointing out over the wide-stretching moor. <div class="bookquote">``Do
you see that Black Tor over yonder? Well, do you see the low hill beyond
with the thornbush upon it? It is the stoniest part of the whole moor.
Is that a place where a shepherd would be likely to take his (<font color='blue'><b>shepherd</b></font>) station?
Your suggestion, sir, is a most absurd one.''

 (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div><p/>I meekly answered that I had spoken without knowing all the facts. My
submission pleased him (<font color='blue'><b>autocrat</b></font>) and led him (<font color='blue'><b>autocrat</b></font>) to further confidences.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``You may be sure, sir, that I have very good grounds before I come to an
opinion. I have seen the boy again and again with his (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>) bundle. Every
day, and sometimes twice a day, I have been able--but wait a moment,
Dr. Watson. Do my eyes deceive me, or is there at the present moment
something moving upon that hillside?''

 (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div><p/>It was several miles off, but I could distinctly see a small dark dot
against the dull green and gray.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Come, sir, come!''  (<font color='red'><b>Frankland/Mr. Frankland</b></font>)</div>cried Frankland, rushing upstairs. <div class="bookquote">``You will see with
your own eyes and judge for yourself.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/>The telescope, a formidable instrument mounted upon a tripod, stood upon
the flat leads of the house. Frankland clapped his (<font color='blue'><b>Frankland</b></font>) eye to it and gave a
cry of satisfaction.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Quick, Dr. Watson, quick, before he (<font color='blue'><b>Watson</b></font>) passes over the hill!''

 (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div><p/>There he (<font color='blue'><b>Frankland</b></font>) was, sure enough, a small urchin with a little bundle upon his (<font color='blue'><b>Frankland</b></font>)
shoulder, toiling slowly up the hill. When he (<font color='blue'><b>Frankland</b></font>) reached the crest I saw
the ragged uncouth figure outlined for an instant against the cold blue
sky. He (<font color='blue'><b>Frankland</b></font>) looked round him (<font color='blue'><b>Frankland</b></font>) with a furtive and stealthy air, as one who
dreads pursuit. Then he (<font color='blue'><b>Frankland</b></font>) vanished over the hill.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Well! Am I right?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Certainly, there is a boy who seems to have some secret errand.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``And what the errand is even a county constable could guess. But not
one word shall they have from me, and I bind you to secrecy also, Dr.
Watson. Not a word! You understand!''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Just as you wish.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``They have treated me shamefully--shamefully. When the facts come out in
Frankland v. Regina I venture to think that a thrill of indignation will
run through the country. Nothing would induce me to help the police in
any way. For all they cared it might have been me, instead of my effigy,
which these rascals burned at the stake. Surely you are not going! You
will help me to empty the decanter in honour of this great occasion!''

 (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div><p/>But I resisted all his (<font color='blue'><b>Frankland</b></font>) solicitations and succeeded in dissuading him (<font color='blue'><b>Frankland</b></font>)
from his (<font color='blue'><b>Frankland</b></font>) announced intention of walking home with me. I kept the road
as long as his (<font color='blue'><b>Frankland</b></font>) eye was on me, and then I struck off across the moor and
made for the stony hill over which the boy had disappeared. Everything
was working in my favour, and I swore that it should not be through lack
of energy or perseverance that I should miss the chance which fortune
had thrown in my way.

<p/>The sun was already sinking when I reached the summit of the hill, and
the long slopes beneath me were all golden-green on one side and gray
shadow on the other. A haze lay low upon the farthest sky-line, out of
which jutted the fantastic shapes of Belliver and Vixen Tor. Over the
wide expanse there was no sound and no movement. One great gray bird, a
gull or curlew, soared aloft in the blue heaven. He (<font color='blue'><b>I</b></font>) and I seemed to be
the only living things between the huge arch of the sky and the desert
beneath it. The barren scene, the sense of loneliness, and the mystery
and urgency of my task all struck a chill into my heart. The boy was
nowhere to be seen. But down beneath me in a cleft of the hills there
was a circle of the old stone huts, and in the middle of them there
was one which retained sufficient roof to act as a screen against the
weather. My heart leaped within me as I saw it. This must be the burrow
where the stranger lurked. At last my foot was on the threshold of his (<font color='blue'><b>stranger</b></font>)
hiding place--his (<font color='blue'><b>stranger</b></font>) secret was within my grasp.

<p/>As I approached the hut, walking as warily as Stapleton would do when
with poised net he (<font color='blue'><b>Stapleton</b></font>) drew near the settled butterfly, I satisfied myself
that the place had indeed been used as a habitation. A vague pathway
among the boulders led to the dilapidated opening which served as a
door. All was silent within. The unknown might be lurking there, or
he (<font color='blue'><b>Stapleton</b></font>) might be prowling on the moor. My nerves tingled with the sense of
adventure. Throwing aside my cigarette, I closed my hand upon the butt
of my revolver and, walking swiftly up to the door, I looked in. The
place was empty.

<p/>But there were ample signs that I had not come upon a false scent. This
was certainly where the man lived. Some blankets rolled in a waterproof
lay upon that very stone slab upon which Neolithic man had once
slumbered. The ashes of a fire were heaped in a rude grate. Beside it
lay some cooking utensils and a bucket half-full of water. A litter of
empty tins showed that the place had been occupied for some time, and I
saw, as my eyes became accustomed to the checkered light, a pannikin and
a half-full bottle of spirits standing in the corner. In the middle of
the hut a flat stone served the purpose of a table, and upon this stood
a small cloth bundle--the same, no doubt, which I had seen through the
telescope upon the shoulder of the boy. It contained a loaf of bread,
a tinned tongue, and two tins of preserved peaches. As I set it down
again, after having examined it, my heart leaped to see that beneath it
there lay a sheet of paper with writing upon it. I raised it, and this
was what I read, roughly scrawled in pencil: <div class="bookquote">``Dr. Watson has gone to
Coombe Tracey.''

 (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div><p/>For a minute I stood there with the paper in my hands thinking out the
meaning of this curt message. It was I, then, and not Sir Henry, who was
being dogged by this secret man. He (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) had not followed me himself, but
he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) had set an agent--the boy, perhaps--upon my track, and this was his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>)
report. Possibly I had taken no step since I had been upon the moor
which had not been observed and reported. Always there was this feeling
of an unseen force, a fine net drawn round us with infinite skill and
delicacy, holding us so lightly that it was only at some supreme moment
that one realized that one was indeed entangled in its meshes.

<p/>If there was one report there might be others, so I looked round the hut
in search of them. There was no trace, however, of anything of the kind,
nor could I discover any sign which might indicate the character or
intentions of the man who lived in this singular place, save that he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>)
must be of Spartan habits and cared little for the comforts of life.
When I thought of the heavy rains and looked at the gaping roof I
understood how strong and immutable must be the purpose which had kept
him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) in that inhospitable abode. Was he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) our malignant enemy, or was he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) by
chance our guardian angel? I swore that I would not leave the hut until
I knew.

<p/>Outside the sun was sinking low and the west was blazing with scarlet
and gold. Its reflection was shot back in ruddy patches by the distant
pools which lay amid the great Grimpen Mire. There were the two towers
of Baskerville Hall, and there a distant blur of smoke which marked the
village of Grimpen. Between the two, behind the hill, was the house
of the Stapletons. All was sweet and mellow and peaceful in the golden
evening light, and yet as I looked at them my soul shared none of the
peace of Nature but quivered at the vagueness and the terror of that
interview which every instant was bringing nearer. With tingling nerves
but a fixed purpose, I sat in the dark recess of the hut and waited with
sombre patience for the coming of its tenant.

<p/>And then at last I heard him (<font color='blue'><b>its</b></font>). Far away came the sharp clink of a boot
striking upon a stone. Then another and yet another, coming nearer and
nearer. I shrank back into the darkest corner and cocked the pistol in
my pocket, determined not to discover myself until I had an opportunity
of seeing something of the stranger. There was a long pause which showed
that he (<font color='blue'><b>stranger</b></font>) had stopped. Then once more the footsteps approached and a
shadow fell across the opening of the hut.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``It is a lovely evening, my dear Watson,''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>said a well-known voice. <div class="bookquote">``I
really think that you will be more comfortable outside than in.''




 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/>Chapter 12. Death on the Moor



<p/>For a moment or two I sat breathless, hardly able to believe my ears.
Then my senses and my voice came back to me, while a crushing weight
of responsibility seemed in an instant to be lifted from my soul. That
cold, incisive, ironical voice could belong to but one man in all the
world.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Holmes!''  (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div>I cried--<div class="bookquote">``Holmes!''

 (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Come out,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>said he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>), <div class="bookquote">``and please be careful with the revolver.''

 (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div><p/>I stooped under the rude lintel, and there he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) sat upon a stone outside,
his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) gray eyes dancing with amusement as they fell upon my astonished
features. He (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) was thin and worn, but clear and alert, his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) keen face
bronzed by the sun and roughened by the wind. In his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) tweed suit and
cloth cap he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) looked like any other tourist upon the moor, and he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) had
contrived, with that catlike love of personal cleanliness which was one
of his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) characteristics, that his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) chin should be as smooth and his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) linen
as perfect as if he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) were in Baker Street.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``I never was more glad to see anyone in my life,''  (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div>said I as I wrung him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>)
by the hand.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Or more astonished, eh?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Well, I must confess to it.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``The surprise was not all on one side, I assure you. I had no idea that
you had found my occasional retreat, still less that you were inside it,
until I was within twenty paces of the door.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``My footprint, I presume?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``No, Watson, I fear that I could not undertake to recognize your
footprint amid all the footprints of the world. If you seriously desire
to deceive me you must change your tobacconist; for when I see the stub
of a cigarette marked Bradley, Oxford Street, I know that my friend
Watson is in the neighbourhood. You will see it there beside the path.
You threw it down, no doubt, at that supreme moment when you charged
into the empty hut.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Exactly.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I thought as much--and knowing your admirable tenacity I was convinced
that you were sitting in ambush, a weapon within reach, waiting for the
tenant to return. So you actually thought that I was the criminal?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I did not know who you were, but I was determined to find out.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Excellent, Watson! And how did you localize me? You saw me, perhaps, on
the night of the convict hunt, when I was so imprudent as to allow the
moon to rise behind me?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Yes, I saw you then.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``And have no doubt searched all the huts until you came to this one?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``No, your boy had been observed, and that gave me a guide where to
look.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``The old gentleman with the telescope, no doubt. I could not make it out
when first I saw the light flashing upon the lens.''  (<font color='red'><b>He</b></font>)</div>He (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) rose and peeped
into the hut. <div class="bookquote">``Ha, I see that Cartwright has brought up some supplies.
What's this paper? So you have been to Coombe Tracey, have you?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Yes.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``To see Mrs. Laura Lyons?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Exactly.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Well done! Our researches have evidently been running on parallel
lines, and when we unite our results I expect we shall have a fairly
full knowledge of the case.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Well, I am glad from my heart that you are here, for indeed the
responsibility and the mystery were both becoming too much for my
nerves. But how in the name of wonder did you come here, and what have
you been doing? I thought that you were in Baker Street working out that
case of blackmailing.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``That was what I wished you to think.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Then you use me, and yet do not trust me!''  (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div>I cried with some
bitterness. <div class="bookquote">``I think that I have deserved better at your hands, Holmes.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``My dear fellow, you have been invaluable to me in this as in many other
cases, and I beg that you will forgive me if I have seemed to play a
trick upon you. In truth, it was partly for your own sake that I did it,
and it was my appreciation of the danger which you ran which led me to
come down and examine the matter for myself. Had I been with Sir Henry
and you it is confident that my point of view would have been the
same as yours, and my presence would have warned our very formidable
opponents to be on their guard. As it is, I have been able to get about
as I could not possibly have done had I been living in the Hall, and
I remain an unknown factor in the business, ready to throw in all my
weight at a critical moment.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``But why keep me in the dark?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``For you to know could not have helped us and might possibly have led
to my discovery. You would have wished to tell me something, or in your
kindness you would have brought me out some comfort or other, and so an
unnecessary risk would be run. I brought Cartwright down with me--you
remember the little chap at the express office--and he (<font color='blue'><b>chap</b></font>) has seen after
my simple wants: a loaf of bread and a clean collar. What does man want
more? He (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) has given me an extra pair of eyes upon a very active pair of
feet, and both have been invaluable.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Then my reports have all been wasted!'' (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div>--My voice trembled as I recalled
the pains and the pride with which I had composed them.

<p/>Holmes took a bundle of papers from his (<font color='blue'><b>Holmes</b></font>) pocket.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Here are your reports, my dear fellow, and very well thumbed, I assure
you. I made excellent arrangements, and they are only delayed one day
upon their way. I must compliment you exceedingly upon the zeal and
the intelligence which you have shown over an extraordinarily difficult
case.''

 (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div><p/>I was still rather raw over the deception which had been practised upon
me, but the warmth of Holmes's praise drove my anger from my mind. I
felt also in my heart that he (<font color='blue'><b>Holmes</b></font>) was right in what he (<font color='blue'><b>Holmes</b></font>) said and that it was
really best for our purpose that I should not have known that he (<font color='blue'><b>Holmes</b></font>) was
upon the moor.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``That's better,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>said he (<font color='blue'><b>Holmes</b></font>), seeing the shadow rise from my face. <div class="bookquote">``And
now tell me the result of your visit to Mrs. Laura Lyons--it was not
difficult for me to guess that it was to see her (<font color='blue'><b>Lyons</b></font>) that you had gone, for
I am already aware that she (<font color='blue'><b>Lyons</b></font>) is the one person in Coombe Tracey who might
be of service to us in the matter. In fact, if you had not gone today it
is exceedingly probable that I should have gone tomorrow.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/>The sun had set and dusk was settling over the moor. The air had turned
chill and we withdrew into the hut for warmth. There, sitting together
in the twilight, I told Holmes of my conversation with the lady. So
interested was he (<font color='blue'><b>Holmes</b></font>) that I had to repeat some of it twice before he (<font color='blue'><b>Holmes</b></font>) was
satisfied.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``This is most important,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>said he (<font color='blue'><b>Holmes</b></font>) when I had concluded. <div class="bookquote">``It fills up a
gap which I had been unable to bridge in this most complex affair. You
are aware, perhaps, that a close intimacy exists between this lady and
the man Stapleton?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I did not know of a close intimacy.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``There can be no doubt about the matter. They meet, they write, there
is a complete understanding between them. Now, this puts a very powerful
weapon into our hands. If I could only use it to detach his (<font color='blue'><b>Stapleton</b></font>) wife--''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``His (<font color='blue'><b>Stapleton</b></font>) wife?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I am giving you some information now, in return for all that you have
given me. The lady who has passed here as Miss Stapleton is in reality
his (<font color='blue'><b>Stapleton</b></font>) wife.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Good heavens, Holmes! Are you sure of what you say? How could he (<font color='blue'><b>Holmes</b></font>) have
permitted Sir Henry to fall in love with her (<font color='blue'><b>Stapleton</b></font>)?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Sir Henry's falling in love could do no harm to anyone except Sir
Henry. He (<font color='blue'><b>Henry</b></font>) took particular care that Sir Henry did not make love to her (<font color='blue'><b>Stapleton</b></font>),
as you have yourself observed. I repeat that the lady is his (<font color='blue'><b>Henry</b></font>) wife and
not his (<font color='blue'><b>Henry</b></font>) sister.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``But why this elaborate deception?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Because he (<font color='blue'><b>Henry</b></font>) foresaw that she (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) would be very much more useful to him (<font color='blue'><b>Henry</b></font>) in
the character of a free woman.''

 (<font color='red'><b>the naturalist</b></font>)</div><p/>All my unspoken instincts, my vague suspicions, suddenly took shape and
centred upon the naturalist. In that impassive colourless man, with his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>)
straw hat and his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) butterfly-net, I seemed to see something terrible--a
creature of infinite patience and craft, with a smiling face and a
murderous heart.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``It is he (<font color='blue'><b>Henry</b></font>), then, who is our enemy--it is he (<font color='blue'><b>Henry</b></font>) who dogged us in London?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``So I read the riddle.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``And the warning--it must have come from her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>)!''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Exactly.''

 (<font color='red'><b>girt</b></font>)</div><p/>The shape of some monstrous villainy, half seen, half guessed, loomed
through the darkness which had girt me so long.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``But are you sure of this, Holmes? How do you know that the woman is his (<font color='blue'><b>Holmes</b></font>)
wife?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Because he (<font color='blue'><b>Holmes</b></font>) so far forgot himself as to tell you a true piece of
autobiography upon the occasion when he (<font color='blue'><b>Holmes</b></font>) first met you, and I dare say
he (<font color='blue'><b>Holmes</b></font>) has many a time regretted it since. He (<font color='blue'><b>Holmes</b></font>) was once a schoolmaster in
the north of England. Now, there is no one more easy to trace than a
schoolmaster. There are scholastic agencies by which one may identify
any man who has been in the profession. A little investigation showed me
that a school had come to grief under atrocious circumstances, and that
the man who had owned it--the name was different--had disappeared with
his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) wife. The descriptions agreed. When I learned that the missing man
was devoted to entomology the identification was complete.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/>The darkness was rising, but much was still hidden by the shadows.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``If this woman is in truth his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) wife, where does Mrs. Laura Lyons come
in?''  (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div>I asked.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``That is one of the points upon which your own researches have shed a
light. Your interview with the lady has cleared the situation very
much. I did not know about a projected divorce between herself and her (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>)
husband. In that case, regarding Stapleton as an unmarried man, she (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>)
counted no doubt upon becoming his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) wife.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``And when she (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) is undeceived?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Why, then we may find the lady of service. It must be our first duty
to see her (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>)--both of us--tomorrow. Don't you think, Watson, that you are
away from your charge rather long? Your place should be at Baskerville
Hall.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/>The last red streaks had faded away in the west and night had settled
upon the moor. A few faint stars were gleaming in a violet sky.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``One last question, Holmes,''  (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div>I said as I rose. <div class="bookquote">``Surely there is no need
of secrecy between you and me. What is the meaning of it all? What is he (<font color='blue'><b>Holmes</b></font>)
after?''

 (<font color='red'><b>Holmes/Mr. Holmes/Sherlock Holmes</b></font>)</div><p/>Holmes's voice sank as he (<font color='blue'><b>Holmes</b></font>) answered:

<p/><div class="bookquote">``It is murder, Watson--refined, cold-blooded, deliberate murder. Do not
ask me for particulars. My nets are closing upon him (<font color='blue'><b>Watson</b></font>), even as his (<font color='blue'><b>Watson</b></font>) are
upon Sir Henry, and with your help he (<font color='blue'><b>Watson</b></font>) is already almost at my mercy.
There is but one danger which can threaten us. It is that he (<font color='blue'><b>Watson</b></font>) should
strike before we are ready to do so. Another day--two at the most--and
I have my case complete, but until then guard your charge as closely
as ever a fond mother watched her (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) ailing child. Your mission today has
justified itself, and yet I could almost wish that you had not left his (<font color='blue'><b>Watson</b></font>)
side. Hark!''

 (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div><p/>A terrible scream--a prolonged yell of horror and anguish--burst out of
the silence of the moor. That frightful cry turned the blood to ice in
my veins.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Oh, my God!''  (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div>I gasped. <div class="bookquote">``What is it? What does it mean?''

 (<font color='red'><b>Holmes/Mr. Holmes/Sherlock Holmes</b></font>)</div><p/>Holmes had sprung to his (<font color='blue'><b>Holmes</b></font>) feet, and I saw his (<font color='blue'><b>Holmes</b></font>) dark, athletic outline at
the door of the hut, his (<font color='blue'><b>Holmes</b></font>) shoulders stooping, his (<font color='blue'><b>Holmes</b></font>) head thrust forward,
his (<font color='blue'><b>Holmes</b></font>) face peering into the darkness.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Hush!''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Holmes</b></font>) whispered. <div class="bookquote">``Hush!''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/>The cry had been loud on account of its vehemence, but it had pealed out
from somewhere far off on the shadowy plain. Now it burst upon our ears,
nearer, louder, more urgent than before.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Where is it?''  (<font color='red'><b>Holmes/Mr. Holmes/Sherlock Holmes</b></font>)</div>Holmes whispered; and I knew from the thrill of his (<font color='blue'><b>Holmes</b></font>) voice
that he (<font color='blue'><b>Holmes</b></font>), the man of iron, was shaken to the soul. <div class="bookquote">``Where is it, Watson?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``There, I think.''  (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div>I pointed into the darkness.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``No, there!''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/>Again the agonized cry swept through the silent night, louder and much
nearer than ever. And a new sound mingled with it, a deep, muttered
rumble, musical and yet menacing, rising and falling like the low,
constant murmur of the sea.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``The hound!''  (<font color='red'><b>Holmes/Mr. Holmes/Sherlock Holmes</b></font>)</div>cried Holmes. <div class="bookquote">``Come, Watson, come! Great heavens, if we are
too late!''

 (<font color='red'><b>He</b></font>)</div><p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Holmes</b></font>) had started running swiftly over the moor, and I had followed at his (<font color='blue'><b>Holmes</b></font>)
heels. But now from somewhere among the broken ground immediately in
front of us there came one last despairing yell, and then a dull, heavy
thud. We halted and listened. Not another sound broke the heavy silence
of the windless night.

<p/>I saw Holmes put his (<font color='blue'><b>Holmes</b></font>) hand to his (<font color='blue'><b>Holmes</b></font>) forehead like a man distracted. He (<font color='blue'><b>Holmes</b></font>)
stamped his (<font color='blue'><b>Holmes</b></font>) feet upon the ground.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``He (<font color='blue'><b>Watson</b></font>) has beaten us, Watson. We are too late.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``No, no, surely not!''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Fool that I was to hold my hand. And you, Watson, see what comes of
abandoning your charge! But, by Heaven, if the worst has happened we'll
avenge him (<font color='blue'><b>Watson</b></font>)!''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/>Blindly we ran through the gloom, blundering against boulders, forcing
our way through gorse bushes, panting up hills and rushing down slopes,
heading always in the direction whence those dreadful sounds had come.
At every rise Holmes looked eagerly round him (<font color='blue'><b>Holmes</b></font>), but the shadows were
thick upon the moor, and nothing moved upon its dreary face.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Can you see anything?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Nothing.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``But, hark, what is that?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/>A low moan had fallen upon our ears. There it was again upon our left!
On that side a ridge of rocks ended in a sheer cliff which overlooked
a stone-strewn slope. On its jagged face was spread-eagled some dark,
irregular object. As we ran towards it the vague outline hardened into
a definite shape. It was a prostrate man face downward upon the ground,
the head doubled under him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) at a horrible angle, the shoulders rounded
and the body hunched together as if in the act of throwing a somersault.
So grotesque was the attitude that I could not for the instant realize
that that moan had been the passing of his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) soul. Not a whisper, not a
rustle, rose now from the dark figure over which we stooped. Holmes laid
his (<font color='blue'><b>Holmes</b></font>) hand upon him (<font color='blue'><b>Holmes</b></font>) and held it up again with an exclamation of horror.
The gleam of the match which he (<font color='blue'><b>Holmes</b></font>) struck shone upon his (<font color='blue'><b>Holmes</b></font>) clotted fingers
and upon the ghastly pool which widened slowly from the crushed skull
of the victim. And it shone upon something else which turned our hearts
sick and faint within us--the body of Sir Henry Baskerville!

<p/>There was no chance of either of us forgetting that peculiar ruddy tweed
suit--the very one which he (<font color='blue'><b>Baskerville</b></font>) had worn on the first morning that we had
seen him (<font color='blue'><b>Baskerville</b></font>) in Baker Street. We caught the one clear glimpse of it, and
then the match flickered and went out, even as the hope had gone out
of our souls. Holmes groaned, and his (<font color='blue'><b>Holmes</b></font>) face glimmered white through the
darkness.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``The brute! The brute!''  (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div>I cried with clenched hands. <div class="bookquote">``Oh Holmes, I shall
never forgive myself for having left him (<font color='blue'><b>Holmes</b></font>) to his (<font color='blue'><b>Holmes</b></font>) fate.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I am more to blame than you, Watson. In order to have my case well
rounded and complete, I have thrown away the life of my client. It is
the greatest blow which has befallen me in my career. But how could I
know--how could I know--that he (<font color='blue'><b>client</b></font>) would risk his (<font color='blue'><b>client</b></font>) life alone upon the moor
in the face of all my warnings?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``That we should have heard his (<font color='blue'><b>client</b></font>) screams--my God, those screams!--and yet
have been unable to save him (<font color='blue'><b>client</b></font>)! Where is this brute of a hound which drove
him (<font color='blue'><b>client</b></font>) to his (<font color='blue'><b>client</b></font>) death? It may be lurking among these rocks at this instant.
And Stapleton, where is he (<font color='blue'><b>Stapleton</b></font>)? He (<font color='blue'><b>Stapleton</b></font>) shall answer for this deed.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``He (<font color='blue'><b>Stapleton</b></font>) shall. I will see to that. Uncle and nephew have been murdered--the
one frightened to death by the very sight of a beast which he (<font color='blue'><b>Uncle</b></font>) thought
to be supernatural, the other driven to his (<font color='blue'><b>Uncle</b></font>) end in his (<font color='blue'><b>Uncle</b></font>) wild flight to
escape from it. But now we have to prove the connection between the
man and the beast. Save from what we heard, we cannot even swear to the
existence of the latter, since Sir Henry has evidently died from the
fall. But, by heavens, cunning as he (<font color='blue'><b>Henry</b></font>) is, the fellow shall be in my power
before another day is past!''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/>We stood with bitter hearts on either side of the mangled body,
overwhelmed by this sudden and irrevocable disaster which had brought
all our long and weary labours to so piteous an end. Then as the moon
rose we climbed to the top of the rocks over which our poor friend had
fallen, and from the summit we gazed out over the shadowy moor, half
silver and half gloom. Far away, miles off, in the direction of Grimpen,
a single steady yellow light was shining. It could only come from the
lonely abode of the Stapletons. With a bitter curse I shook my fist at
it as I gazed.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Why should we not seize him (<font color='blue'><b>Henry</b></font>) at once?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Our case is not complete. The fellow is wary and cunning to the last
degree. It is not what we know, but what we can prove. If we make one
false move the villain may escape us yet.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``What can we do?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``There will be plenty for us to do tomorrow. Tonight we can only perform
the last offices to our poor friend.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/>Together we made our way down the precipitous slope and approached the
body, black and clear against the silvered stones. The agony of those
contorted limbs struck me with a spasm of pain and blurred my eyes with
tears.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``We must send for help, Holmes! We cannot carry him (<font color='blue'><b>Holmes</b></font>) all the way to the
Hall. Good heavens, are you mad?''

 (<font color='red'><b>He</b></font>)</div><p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>we</b></font>) had uttered a cry and bent over the body. Now he (<font color='blue'><b>we</b></font>) was dancing and
laughing and wringing my hand. Could this be my stern, self-contained
friend? These were hidden fires, indeed!

<p/><div class="bookquote">``A beard! A beard! The man has a beard!''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``A beard?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``It is not the baronet--it is--why, it is my neighbour, the convict!''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/>With feverish haste we had turned the body over, and that dripping beard
was pointing up to the cold, clear moon. There could be no doubt about
the beetling forehead, the sunken animal eyes. It was indeed the same
face which had glared upon me in the light of the candle from over the
rock--the face of Selden, the criminal.

<p/>Then in an instant it was all clear to me. I remembered how the baronet
had told me that he (<font color='blue'><b>friend</b></font>) had handed his (<font color='blue'><b>friend</b></font>) old wardrobe to Barrymore. Barrymore
had passed it on in order to help Selden in his (<font color='blue'><b>friend</b></font>) escape. Boots, shirt,
cap--it was all Sir Henry's. The tragedy was still black enough, but
this man had at least deserved death by the laws of his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) country. I told
Holmes how the matter stood, my heart bubbling over with thankfulness
and joy.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Then the clothes have been the poor devil's death,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>said he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>). <div class="bookquote">``It is
clear enough that the hound has been laid on from some article of
Sir Henry's--the boot which was abstracted in the hotel, in all
probability--and so ran this man down. There is one very singular thing,
however: How came Selden, in the darkness, to know that the hound was on
his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) trail?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``He (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) heard him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>).''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``To hear a hound upon the moor would not work a hard man like this
convict into such a paroxysm of terror that he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) would risk recapture
by screaming wildly for help. By his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) cries he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) must have run a long way
after he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) knew the animal was on his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) track. How did he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) know?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``A greater mystery to me is why this hound, presuming that all our
conjectures are correct--''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I presume nothing.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Well, then, why this hound should be loose tonight. I suppose that it
does not always run loose upon the moor. Stapleton would not let it go
unless he (<font color='blue'><b>Stapleton</b></font>) had reason to think that Sir Henry would be there.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``My difficulty is the more formidable of the two, for I think that we
shall very shortly get an explanation of yours, while mine may remain
forever a mystery. The question now is, what shall we do with this poor
wretch's body? We cannot leave it here to the foxes and the ravens.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I suggest that we put it in one of the huts until we can communicate
with the police.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Exactly. I have no doubt that you and I could carry it so far. Halloa,
Watson, what's this? It's the man himself, by all that's wonderful and
audacious! Not a word to show your suspicions--not a word, or my plans
crumble to the ground.''

 (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div><p/>A figure was approaching us over the moor, and I saw the dull red glow
of a cigar. The moon shone upon him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>), and I could distinguish the dapper
shape and jaunty walk of the naturalist. He (<font color='blue'><b>naturalist</b></font>) stopped when he (<font color='blue'><b>naturalist</b></font>) saw us, and
then came on again.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Why, Dr. Watson, that's not you, is it? You are the last man that I
should have expected to see out on the moor at this time of night. But,
dear me, what's this? Somebody hurt? Not--don't tell me that it is our
friend Sir Henry!''  (<font color='red'><b>He</b></font>)</div>He (<font color='blue'><b>naturalist</b></font>) hurried past me and stooped over the dead man. I
heard a sharp intake of his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) breath and the cigar fell from his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) fingers.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Who--who's this?''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) stammered.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``It is Selden, the man who escaped from Princetown.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Stapleton/Mr. Stapleton</b></font>)</div><p/>Stapleton turned a ghastly face upon us, but by a supreme effort he (<font color='blue'><b>Stapleton</b></font>) had
overcome his (<font color='blue'><b>Stapleton</b></font>) amazement and his (<font color='blue'><b>Stapleton</b></font>) disappointment. He (<font color='blue'><b>Stapleton</b></font>) looked sharply from
Holmes to me. <div class="bookquote">``Dear me! What a very shocking affair! How did he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) die?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``He (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) appears to have broken his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) neck by falling over these rocks. My
friend and I were strolling on the moor when we heard a cry.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I heard a cry also. That was what brought me out. I was uneasy about
Sir Henry.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Why about Sir Henry in particular?''  (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div>I could not help asking.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Because I had suggested that he (<font color='blue'><b>Henry</b></font>) should come over. When he (<font color='blue'><b>Henry</b></font>) did not come
I was surprised, and I naturally became alarmed for his (<font color='blue'><b>Henry</b></font>) safety when I
heard cries upon the moor. By the way'' (<font color='red'><b>Holmes/Mr. Holmes/Sherlock Holmes</b></font>)</div>--his (<font color='blue'><b>Stapleton</b></font>) eyes darted again from my
face to Holmes's--<div class="bookquote">``did you hear anything else besides a cry?''

 (<font color='red'><b>Holmes/Mr. Holmes/Sherlock Holmes</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``No,''  (<font color='red'><b>Holmes/Mr. Holmes/Sherlock Holmes</b></font>)</div>said Holmes; <div class="bookquote">``did you?''

 (<font color='red'><b>Holmes/Mr. Holmes/Sherlock Holmes</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``No.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``What do you mean, then?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Oh, you know the stories that the peasants tell about a phantom
hound, and so on. It is said to be heard at night upon the moor. I was
wondering if there were any evidence of such a sound tonight.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``We heard nothing of the kind,''  (<font color='red'><b>I.</b></font>)</div>said I.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``And what is your theory of this poor fellow's death?''

 (<font color='red'><b>I.</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I have no doubt that anxiety and exposure have driven him (<font color='blue'><b>fellow</b></font>) off his (<font color='blue'><b>fellow</b></font>) head.
He (<font color='blue'><b>fellow</b></font>) has rushed about the moor in a crazy state and eventually fallen over
here and broken his (<font color='blue'><b>fellow</b></font>) neck.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``That seems the most reasonable theory,''  (<font color='red'><b>Stapleton/Mr. Stapleton</b></font>)</div>said Stapleton, and he (<font color='blue'><b>Stapleton</b></font>) gave a
sigh which I took to indicate his (<font color='blue'><b>Stapleton</b></font>) relief. <div class="bookquote">``What do you think about it,
Mr. Sherlock Holmes?''

 (<font color='red'><b>friend</b></font>)</div><p/>My friend bowed his (<font color='blue'><b>Stapleton</b></font>) compliments. <div class="bookquote">``You are quick at identification,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>said
he (<font color='blue'><b>Stapleton</b></font>).

<p/><div class="bookquote">``We have been expecting you in these parts since Dr. Watson came down.
You are in time to see a tragedy.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Yes, indeed. I have no doubt that my friend's explanation will cover
the facts. I will take an unpleasant remembrance back to London with me
tomorrow.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Oh, you return tomorrow?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``That is my intention.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I hope your visit has cast some light upon those occurrences which have
puzzled us?''

 (<font color='red'><b>Holmes/Mr. Holmes/Sherlock Holmes</b></font>)</div><p/>Holmes shrugged his (<font color='blue'><b>Holmes</b></font>) shoulders.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``One cannot always have the success for which one hopes. An investigator
needs facts and not legends or rumours. It has not been a satisfactory
case.''

 (<font color='red'><b>friend</b></font>)</div><p/>My friend spoke in his (<font color='blue'><b>friend</b></font>) frankest and most unconcerned manner. Stapleton
still looked hard at him (<font color='blue'><b>Stapleton</b></font>). Then he (<font color='blue'><b>Stapleton</b></font>) turned to me.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``I would suggest carrying this poor fellow to my house, but it would
give my sister such a fright that I do not feel justified in doing it.
I think that if we put something over his (<font color='blue'><b>fellow</b></font>) face he (<font color='blue'><b>fellow</b></font>) will be safe until
morning.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/>And so it was arranged. Resisting Stapleton's offer of hospitality,
Holmes and I set off to Baskerville Hall, leaving the naturalist to
return alone. Looking back we saw the figure moving slowly away over the
broad moor, and behind him (<font color='blue'><b>Holmes</b></font>) that one black smudge on the silvered slope
which showed where the man was lying who had come so horribly to his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>)
end.




<p/>Chapter 13. Fixing the Nets



<p/><div class="bookquote">``We're at close grips at last,''  (<font color='red'><b>the Nets</b></font>)</div>said Holmes as we walked together across
the moor. <div class="bookquote">``What a nerve the fellow has! How he (<font color='blue'><b>fellow</b></font>) pulled himself together
in the face of what must have been a paralyzing shock when he (<font color='blue'><b>fellow</b></font>) found that
the wrong man had fallen a victim to his (<font color='blue'><b>fellow</b></font>) plot. I told you in London,
Watson, and I tell you now again, that we have never had a foeman more
worthy of our steel.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I am sorry that he (<font color='blue'><b>Watson</b></font>) has seen you.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``And so was I at first. But there was no getting out of it.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``What effect do you think it will have upon his (<font color='blue'><b>Watson</b></font>) plans now that he (<font color='blue'><b>Watson</b></font>) knows
you are here?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``It may cause him (<font color='blue'><b>Watson</b></font>) to be more cautious, or it may drive him (<font color='blue'><b>Watson</b></font>) to desperate
measures at once. Like most clever criminals, he (<font color='blue'><b>Watson</b></font>) may be too confident in
his (<font color='blue'><b>Watson</b></font>) own cleverness and imagine that he (<font color='blue'><b>Watson</b></font>) has completely deceived us.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Why should we not arrest him (<font color='blue'><b>Watson</b></font>) at once?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``My dear Watson, you were born to be a man of action. Your instinct is
always to do something energetic. But supposing, for argument's sake,
that we had him (<font color='blue'><b>Watson</b></font>) arrested tonight, what on earth the better off should
we be for that? We could prove nothing against him (<font color='blue'><b>Watson</b></font>). There's the devilish
cunning of it! If he (<font color='blue'><b>Watson</b></font>) were acting through a human agent we could get some
evidence, but if we were to drag this great dog to the light of day it
would not help us in putting a rope round the neck of its master.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Surely we have a case.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Not a shadow of one--only surmise and conjecture. We should be laughed
out of court if we came with such a story and such evidence.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``There is Sir Charles's death.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Found dead without a mark upon him (<font color='blue'><b>Charles</b></font>). You and I know that he (<font color='blue'><b>Charles</b></font>) died of
sheer fright, and we know also what frightened him (<font color='blue'><b>Charles</b></font>), but how are we to
get twelve stolid jurymen to know it? What signs are there of a hound?
Where are the marks of its fangs? Of course we know that a hound does
not bite a dead body and that Sir Charles was dead before ever the
brute overtook him (<font color='blue'><b>Charles</b></font>). But we have to prove all this, and we are not in a
position to do it.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Well, then, tonight?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``We are not much better off tonight. Again, there was no direct
connection between the hound and the man's death. We never saw the
hound. We heard it, but we could not prove that it was running upon this
man's trail. There is a complete absence of motive. No, my dear fellow;
we must reconcile ourselves to the fact that we have no case at present,
and that it is worth our while to run any risk in order to establish
one.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``And how do you propose to do so?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I have great hopes of what Mrs. Laura Lyons may do for us when the
position of affairs is made clear to her (<font color='blue'><b>Lyons</b></font>). And I have my own plan as
well. Sufficient for tomorrow is the evil thereof; but I hope before the
day is past to have the upper hand at last.''

 (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div><p/>I could draw nothing further from him (<font color='blue'><b>Holmes</b></font>), and he (<font color='blue'><b>Holmes</b></font>) walked, lost in thought,
as far as the Baskerville gates.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Are you coming up?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Yes; I see no reason for further concealment. But one last word,
Watson. Say nothing of the hound to Sir Henry. Let him (<font color='blue'><b>Henry</b></font>) think that
Selden's death was as Stapleton would have us believe. He (<font color='blue'><b>Stapleton</b></font>) will have a
better nerve for the ordeal which he (<font color='blue'><b>Stapleton</b></font>) will have to undergo tomorrow,
when he (<font color='blue'><b>Stapleton</b></font>) is engaged, if I remember your report aright, to dine with these
people.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``And so am I.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Then you must excuse yourself and he (<font color='blue'><b>Stapleton</b></font>) must go alone. That will be easily
arranged. And now, if we are too late for dinner, I think that we are
both ready for our suppers.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Henry/Henry Baskerville/Baskerville</b></font>)</div><p/>Sir Henry was more pleased than surprised to see Sherlock Holmes, for he (<font color='blue'><b>Holmes</b></font>)
had for some days been expecting that recent events would bring him (<font color='blue'><b>Holmes</b></font>) down
from London. He (<font color='blue'><b>Holmes</b></font>) did raise his (<font color='blue'><b>Holmes</b></font>) eyebrows, however, when he (<font color='blue'><b>Holmes</b></font>) found that my
friend had neither any luggage nor any explanations for its absence.
Between us we soon supplied his (<font color='blue'><b>Holmes</b></font>) wants, and then over a belated supper
we explained to the baronet as much of our experience as it seemed
desirable that he (<font color='blue'><b>Holmes</b></font>) should know. But first I had the unpleasant duty of
breaking the news to Barrymore and his (<font color='blue'><b>Holmes</b></font>) wife. To him (<font color='blue'><b>Holmes</b></font>) it may have been an
unmitigated relief, but she (<font color='blue'><b>Barrymore</b></font>) wept bitterly in her (<font color='blue'><b>Barrymore</b></font>) apron. To all the world
he (<font color='blue'><b>Holmes</b></font>) was the man of violence, half animal and half demon; but to her (<font color='blue'><b>Barrymore</b></font>) he (<font color='blue'><b>Holmes</b></font>)
always remained the little wilful boy of her (<font color='blue'><b>Barrymore</b></font>) own girlhood, the child who
had clung to her (<font color='blue'><b>Barrymore</b></font>) hand. Evil indeed is the man who has not one woman to
mourn him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>).

<p/><div class="bookquote">``I've been moping in the house all day since Watson went off in the
morning,''  (<font color='red'><b>the baronet</b></font>)</div>said the baronet. <div class="bookquote">``I guess I should have some credit, for I
have kept my promise. If I hadn't sworn not to go about alone I might
have had a more lively evening, for I had a message from Stapleton
asking me over there.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I have no doubt that you would have had a more lively evening,''  (<font color='red'><b>Holmes/Mr. Holmes/Sherlock Holmes</b></font>)</div>said
Holmes drily. <div class="bookquote">``By the way, I don't suppose you appreciate that we have
been mourning over you as having broken your neck?''

 (<font color='red'><b>Henry/Henry Baskerville/Baskerville</b></font>)</div><p/>Sir Henry opened his (<font color='blue'><b>Henry</b></font>) eyes. <div class="bookquote">``How was that?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``This poor wretch was dressed in your clothes. I fear your servant who
gave them to him (<font color='blue'><b>servant</b></font>) may get into trouble with the police.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``That is unlikely. There was no mark on any of them, as far as I know.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``That's lucky for him (<font color='blue'><b>servant</b></font>)--in fact, it's lucky for all of you, since you are
all on the wrong side of the law in this matter. I am not sure that as
a conscientious detective my first duty is not to arrest the whole
household. Watson's reports are most incriminating documents.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``But how about the case?''  (<font color='red'><b>the baronet</b></font>)</div>asked the baronet. <div class="bookquote">``Have you made anything out
of the tangle? I don't know that Watson and I are much the wiser since
we came down.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I think that I shall be in a position to make the situation rather more
clear to you before long. It has been an exceedingly difficult and most
complicated business. There are several points upon which we still want
light--but it is coming all the same.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``We've had one experience, as Watson has no doubt told you. We heard the
hound on the moor, so I can swear that it is not all empty superstition.
I had something to do with dogs when I was out West, and I know one when
I hear one. If you can muzzle that one and put him (<font color='blue'><b>Watson</b></font>) on a chain I'll be
ready to swear you are the greatest detective of all time.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I think I will muzzle him (<font color='blue'><b>detective</b></font>) and chain him (<font color='blue'><b>detective</b></font>) all right if you will give me
your help.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Whatever you tell me to do I will do.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Very good; and I will ask you also to do it blindly, without always
asking the reason.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Just as you like.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``If you will do this I think the chances are that our little problem
will soon be solved. I have no doubt--''

 (<font color='red'><b>He</b></font>)</div><p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Henry</b></font>) stopped suddenly and stared fixedly up over my head into the air. The
lamp beat upon his (<font color='blue'><b>Henry</b></font>) face, and so intent was it and so still that it might
have been that of a clear-cut classical statue, a personification of
alertness and expectation.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``What is it?''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>we both cried.

<p/>I could see as he (<font color='blue'><b>Henry</b></font>) looked down that he (<font color='blue'><b>Henry</b></font>) was repressing some internal
emotion. His (<font color='blue'><b>Henry</b></font>) features were still composed, but his (<font color='blue'><b>Henry</b></font>) eyes shone with
amused exultation.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Excuse the admiration of a connoisseur,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>said he (<font color='blue'><b>Henry</b></font>) as he (<font color='blue'><b>Henry</b></font>) waved his (<font color='blue'><b>Henry</b></font>) hand
towards the line of portraits which covered the opposite wall. <div class="bookquote">``Watson
won't allow that I know anything of art but that is mere jealousy
because our views upon the subject differ. Now, these are a really very
fine series of portraits.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Well, I'm glad to hear you say so,''  (<font color='red'><b>Henry/Henry Baskerville/Baskerville</b></font>)</div>said Sir Henry, glancing with some
surprise at my friend. <div class="bookquote">``I don't pretend to know much about these things,
and I'd be a better judge of a horse or a steer than of a picture. I
didn't know that you found time for such things.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I know what is good when I see it, and I see it now. That's a Kneller,
I'll swear, that lady in the blue silk over yonder, and the stout
gentleman with the wig ought to be a Reynolds. They are all family
portraits, I presume?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Every one.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Do you know the names?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Barrymore has been coaching me in them, and I think I can say my
lessons fairly well.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Who is the gentleman with the telescope?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``That is Rear-Admiral Baskerville, who served under Rodney in the West
Indies. The man with the blue coat and the roll of paper is Sir William
Baskerville, who was Chairman of Committees of the House of Commons
under Pitt.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``And this Cavalier opposite to me--the one with the black velvet and the
lace?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Ah, you have a right to know about him (<font color='blue'><b>Chairman</b></font>). That is the cause of all the
mischief, the wicked Hugo, who started the Hound of the Baskervilles.
We're not likely to forget him (<font color='blue'><b>Hugo</b></font>).''

 (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div><p/>I gazed with interest and some surprise upon the portrait.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Dear me!''  (<font color='red'><b>Holmes/Mr. Holmes/Sherlock Holmes</b></font>)</div>said Holmes, <div class="bookquote">``he (<font color='blue'><b>Hugo</b></font>) seems a quiet, meek-mannered man enough, but
I dare say that there was a lurking devil in his (<font color='blue'><b>devil</b></font>) eyes. I had pictured
him (<font color='blue'><b>devil</b></font>) as a more robust and ruffianly person.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Holmes/Mr. Holmes/Sherlock Holmes</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``There's no doubt about the authenticity, for the name and the date,
1647, are on the back of the canvas.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Holmes/Mr. Holmes/Sherlock Holmes</b></font>)</div><p/>Holmes said little more, but the picture of the old roysterer seemed to
have a fascination for him (<font color='blue'><b>Holmes</b></font>), and his (<font color='blue'><b>Holmes</b></font>) eyes were continually fixed upon it
during supper. It was not until later, when Sir Henry had gone to his (<font color='blue'><b>Henry</b></font>)
room, that I was able to follow the trend of his (<font color='blue'><b>Henry</b></font>) thoughts. He (<font color='blue'><b>Henry</b></font>) led me
back into the banqueting-hall, his (<font color='blue'><b>Henry</b></font>) bedroom candle in his (<font color='blue'><b>Henry</b></font>) hand, and he (<font color='blue'><b>Henry</b></font>)
held it up against the time-stained portrait on the wall.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Do you see anything there?''

 (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div><p/>I looked at the broad plumed hat, the curling love-locks, the white lace
collar, and the straight, severe face which was framed between them. It
was not a brutal countenance, but it was prim, hard, and stern, with a
firm-set, thin-lipped mouth, and a coldly intolerant eye.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Is it like anyone you know?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``There is something of Sir Henry about the jaw.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Just a suggestion, perhaps. But wait an instant!''  (<font color='red'><b>He</b></font>)</div>He (<font color='blue'><b>Henry</b></font>) stood upon a
chair, and, holding up the light in his (<font color='blue'><b>Henry</b></font>) left hand, he (<font color='blue'><b>Henry</b></font>) curved his (<font color='blue'><b>Henry</b></font>) right
arm over the broad hat and round the long ringlets.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Good heavens!''  (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div>I cried in amazement.

<p/>The face of Stapleton had sprung out of the canvas.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Ha, you see it now. My eyes have been trained to examine faces and not
their trimmings. It is the first quality of a criminal investigator that
he (<font color='blue'><b>investigator</b></font>) should see through a disguise.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``But this is marvellous. It might be his (<font color='blue'><b>investigator</b></font>) portrait.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Yes, it is an interesting instance of a throwback, which appears to be
both physical and spiritual. A study of family portraits is enough
to convert a man to the doctrine of reincarnation. The fellow is a
Baskerville--that is evident.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``With designs upon the succession.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Exactly. This chance of the picture has supplied us with one of our
most obvious missing links. We have him (<font color='blue'><b>fellow</b></font>), Watson, we have him (<font color='blue'><b>Watson</b></font>), and I dare
swear that before tomorrow night he (<font color='blue'><b>Watson</b></font>) will be fluttering in our net as
helpless as one of his (<font color='blue'><b>Watson</b></font>) own butterflies. A pin, a cork, and a card, and
we add him (<font color='blue'><b>Watson</b></font>) to the Baker Street collection!''  (<font color='red'><b>He</b></font>)</div>He (<font color='blue'><b>Stapleton</b></font>) burst into one of his (<font color='blue'><b>Stapleton</b></font>)
rare fits of laughter as he (<font color='blue'><b>Stapleton</b></font>) turned away from the picture. I have not
heard him (<font color='blue'><b>Stapleton</b></font>) laugh often, and it has always boded ill to somebody.

<p/>I was up betimes in the morning, but Holmes was afoot earlier still, for
I saw him (<font color='blue'><b>Holmes</b></font>) as I dressed, coming up the drive.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Yes, we should have a full day today,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Holmes</b></font>) remarked, and he (<font color='blue'><b>Holmes</b></font>) rubbed his (<font color='blue'><b>Holmes</b></font>)
hands with the joy of action. <div class="bookquote">``The nets are all in place, and the drag
is about to begin. We'll know before the day is out whether we have
caught our big, leanjawed pike, or whether he (<font color='blue'><b>Baker</b></font>) has got through the
meshes.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Have you been on the moor already?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I have sent a report from Grimpen to Princetown as to the death of
Selden. I think I can promise that none of you will be troubled in the
matter. And I have also communicated with my faithful Cartwright, who
would certainly have pined away at the door of my hut, as a dog does at
his (<font color='blue'><b>Cartwright</b></font>) master's grave, if I had not set his (<font color='blue'><b>Cartwright</b></font>) mind at rest about my safety.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``What is the next move?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``To see Sir Henry. Ah, here he (<font color='blue'><b>Henry</b></font>) is!''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Good-morning, Holmes,''  (<font color='red'><b>the baronet</b></font>)</div>said the baronet. <div class="bookquote">``You look like a general who
is planning a battle with his (<font color='blue'><b>Holmes</b></font>) chief of the staff.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``That is the exact situation. Watson was asking for orders.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``And so do I.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Very good. You are engaged, as I understand, to dine with our friends
the Stapletons tonight.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I hope that you will come also. They are very hospitable people, and I
am sure that they would be very glad to see you.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I fear that Watson and I must go to London.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``To London?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Yes, I think that we should be more useful there at the present
juncture.''

 (<font color='red'><b>The baronet</b></font>)</div><p/>The baronet's face perceptibly lengthened.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``I hoped that you were going to see me through this business. The Hall
and the moor are not very pleasant places when one is alone.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``My dear fellow, you must trust me implicitly and do exactly what I tell
you. You can tell your friends that we should have been happy to have
come with you, but that urgent business required us to be in town. We
hope very soon to return to Devonshire. Will you remember to give them
that message?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``If you insist upon it.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``There is no alternative, I assure you.''

 (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div><p/>I saw by the baronet's clouded brow that he (<font color='blue'><b>Holmes</b></font>) was deeply hurt by what he (<font color='blue'><b>Holmes</b></font>)
regarded as our desertion.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``When do you desire to go?''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Holmes</b></font>) asked coldly.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Immediately after breakfast. We will drive in to Coombe Tracey, but
Watson will leave his (<font color='blue'><b>Watson</b></font>) things as a pledge that he (<font color='blue'><b>Watson</b></font>) will come back to you.
Watson, you will send a note to Stapleton to tell him (<font color='blue'><b>Watson</b></font>) that you regret
that you cannot come.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I have a good mind to go to London with you,''  (<font color='red'><b>the baronet</b></font>)</div>said the baronet. <div class="bookquote">``Why
should I stay here alone?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Because it is your post of duty. Because you gave me your word that you
would do as you were told, and I tell you to stay.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``All right, then, I'll stay.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``One more direction! I wish you to drive to Merripit House. Send back
your trap, however, and let them know that you intend to walk home.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``To walk across the moor?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Yes.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``But that is the very thing which you have so often cautioned me not to
do.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``This time you may do it with safety. If I had not every confidence in
your nerve and courage I would not suggest it, but it is essential that
you should do it.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Then I will do it.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``And as you value your life do not go across the moor in any direction
save along the straight path which leads from Merripit House to the
Grimpen Road, and is your natural way home.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I will do just what you say.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Very good. I should be glad to get away as soon after breakfast as
possible, so as to reach London in the afternoon.''

 (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div><p/>I was much astounded by this programme, though I remembered that Holmes
had said to Stapleton on the night before that his (<font color='blue'><b>Holmes</b></font>) visit would terminate
next day. It had not crossed my mind however, that he (<font color='blue'><b>Holmes</b></font>) would wish me to
go with him (<font color='blue'><b>Holmes</b></font>), nor could I understand how we could both be absent at a
moment which he (<font color='blue'><b>Holmes</b></font>) himself declared to be critical. There was nothing for
it, however, but implicit obedience; so we bade good-bye to our rueful
friend, and a couple of hours afterwards we were at the station of
Coombe Tracey and had dispatched the trap upon its return journey. A
small boy was waiting upon the platform.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Any orders, sir?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``You will take this train to town, Cartwright. The moment you arrive you
will send a wire to Sir Henry Baskerville, in my name, to say that if he (<font color='blue'><b>Baskerville</b></font>)
finds the pocketbook which I have dropped he (<font color='blue'><b>Baskerville</b></font>) is to send it by registered
post to Baker Street.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Yes, sir.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``And ask at the station office if there is a message for me.''

 (<font color='red'><b>The boy</b></font>)</div><p/>The boy returned with a telegram, which Holmes handed to me. It ran:

<p/>Wire received. Coming down with unsigned warrant. Arrive five-forty.
Lestrade.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``That is in answer to mine of this morning. He (<font color='blue'><b>Baker</b></font>) is the best of the
professionals, I think, and we may need his (<font color='blue'><b>Baker</b></font>) assistance. Now, Watson, I
think that we cannot employ our time better than by calling upon your
acquaintance, Mrs. Laura Lyons.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/>His (<font color='blue'><b>Holmes</b></font>) plan of campaign was beginning to be evident. He (<font color='blue'><b>Holmes</b></font>) would use the
baronet in order to convince the Stapletons that we were really gone,
while we should actually return at the instant when we were likely to
be needed. That telegram from London, if mentioned by Sir Henry to the
Stapletons, must remove the last suspicions from their minds. Already I
seemed to see our nets drawing closer around that leanjawed pike.

<p/>Mrs. Laura Lyons was in her (<font color='blue'><b>Lyons</b></font>) office, and Sherlock Holmes opened his (<font color='blue'><b>Holmes</b></font>)
interview with a frankness and directness which considerably amazed her (<font color='blue'><b>Lyons</b></font>).

<p/><div class="bookquote">``I am investigating the circumstances which attended the death of the
late Sir Charles Baskerville,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>said he (<font color='blue'><b>Holmes</b></font>). <div class="bookquote">``My friend here, Dr. Watson,
has informed me of what you have communicated, and also of what you have
withheld in connection with that matter.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``What have I withheld?''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Lyons</b></font>) asked defiantly.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``You have confessed that you asked Sir Charles to be at the gate at ten
o’clock. We know that that was the place and hour of his (<font color='blue'><b>Charles</b></font>) death. You have
withheld what the connection is between these events.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``There is no connection.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``In that case the coincidence must indeed be an extraordinary one. But
I think that we shall succeed in establishing a connection, after all. I
wish to be perfectly frank with you, Mrs. Lyons. We regard this case as
one of murder, and the evidence may implicate not only your friend Mr.
Stapleton but his (<font color='blue'><b>Stapleton</b></font>) wife as well.''

 (<font color='red'><b>The lady</b></font>)</div><p/>The lady sprang from her (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) chair.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``His (<font color='blue'><b>Stapleton</b></font>) wife!''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) cried.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``The fact is no longer a secret. The person who has passed for his (<font color='blue'><b>Stapleton</b></font>)
sister is really his (<font color='blue'><b>Stapleton</b></font>) wife.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Mrs. Laura Lyons/Mrs. Lyons/Lyons</b></font>)</div><p/>Mrs. Lyons had resumed her (<font color='blue'><b>Lyons</b></font>) seat. Her (<font color='blue'><b>Lyons</b></font>) hands were grasping the arms of her (<font color='blue'><b>Lyons</b></font>)
chair, and I saw that the pink nails had turned white with the pressure
of her (<font color='blue'><b>Lyons</b></font>) grip.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``His (<font color='blue'><b>Stapleton</b></font>) wife!''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Lyons</b></font>) said again. <div class="bookquote">``His (<font color='blue'><b>Stapleton</b></font>) wife! He (<font color='blue'><b>Stapleton</b></font>) is not a married man.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Holmes/Mr. Holmes/Sherlock Holmes</b></font>)</div><p/>Sherlock Holmes shrugged his (<font color='blue'><b>Holmes</b></font>) shoulders.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Prove it to me! Prove it to me! And if you can do so--!''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/>The fierce flash of her (<font color='blue'><b>Lyons</b></font>) eyes said more than any words.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``I have come prepared to do so,''  (<font color='red'><b>Holmes/Mr. Holmes/Sherlock Holmes</b></font>)</div>said Holmes, drawing several papers
from his (<font color='blue'><b>Holmes</b></font>) pocket. <div class="bookquote">``Here is a photograph of the couple taken in York four
years ago. It is indorsed `Mr. and Mrs. Vandeleur,' but you will have no
difficulty in recognizing him (<font color='blue'><b>Mr.</b></font>), and her (<font color='blue'><b>Vandeleur</b></font>) also, if you know her (<font color='blue'><b>Vandeleur</b></font>) by sight.
Here are three written descriptions by trustworthy witnesses of Mr. and
Mrs. Vandeleur, who at that time kept St. Oliver's private school. Read
them and see if you can doubt the identity of these people.''

 (<font color='red'><b>She</b></font>)</div><p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>Lyons</b></font>) glanced at them, and then looked up at us with the set, rigid face
of a desperate woman.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Mr. Holmes,''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) said, <div class="bookquote">``this man had offered me marriage on condition
that I could get a divorce from my husband. He (<font color='blue'><b>husband</b></font>) has lied to me, the
villain, in every conceivable way. Not one word of truth has he (<font color='blue'><b>husband</b></font>) ever
told me. And why--why? I imagined that all was for my own sake. But now
I see that I was never anything but a tool in his (<font color='blue'><b>husband</b></font>) hands. Why should I
preserve faith with him (<font color='blue'><b>husband</b></font>) who never kept any with me? Why should I try to
shield him (<font color='blue'><b>husband</b></font>) from the consequences of his (<font color='blue'><b>husband</b></font>) own wicked acts? Ask me what you
like, and there is nothing which I shall hold back. One thing I swear
to you, and that is that when I wrote the letter I never dreamed of any
harm to the old gentleman, who had been my kindest friend.''

 (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I entirely believe you, madam,''  (<font color='red'><b>Holmes/Mr. Holmes/Sherlock Holmes</b></font>)</div>said Sherlock Holmes. <div class="bookquote">``The recital of
these events must be very painful to you, and perhaps it will make it
easier if I tell you what occurred, and you can check me if I make any
material mistake. The sending of this letter was suggested to you by
Stapleton?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``He (<font color='blue'><b>Stapleton</b></font>) dictated it.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I presume that the reason he (<font color='blue'><b>Stapleton</b></font>) gave was that you would receive help from
Sir Charles for the legal expenses connected with your divorce?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Exactly.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``And then after you had sent the letter he (<font color='blue'><b>Charles</b></font>) dissuaded you from keeping
the appointment?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``He (<font color='blue'><b>Charles</b></font>) told me that it would hurt his (<font color='blue'><b>Charles</b></font>) self-respect that any other man
should find the money for such an object, and that though he (<font color='blue'><b>Charles</b></font>) was a poor
man himself he (<font color='blue'><b>Charles</b></font>) would devote his (<font color='blue'><b>Charles</b></font>) last penny to removing the obstacles
which divided us.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``He (<font color='blue'><b>Charles</b></font>) appears to be a very consistent character. And then you heard
nothing until you read the reports of the death in the paper?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``No.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``And he (<font color='blue'><b>Charles</b></font>) made you swear to say nothing about your appointment with Sir
Charles?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``He (<font color='blue'><b>Charles</b></font>) did. He (<font color='blue'><b>Charles</b></font>) said that the death was a very mysterious one, and that I
should certainly be suspected if the facts came out. He (<font color='blue'><b>Charles</b></font>) frightened me
into remaining silent.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Quite so. But you had your suspicions?''

 (<font color='red'><b>She</b></font>)</div><p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) hesitated and looked down.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``I knew him (<font color='blue'><b>Charles</b></font>),''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) said. <div class="bookquote">``But if he (<font color='blue'><b>Charles</b></font>) had kept faith with me I should
always have done so with him (<font color='blue'><b>Charles</b></font>).''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I think that on the whole you have had a fortunate escape,''  (<font color='red'><b>Holmes/Mr. Holmes/Sherlock Holmes</b></font>)</div>said
Sherlock Holmes. <div class="bookquote">``You have had him (<font color='blue'><b>Charles</b></font>) in your power and he (<font color='blue'><b>Charles</b></font>) knew it, and yet
you are alive. You have been walking for some months very near to the
edge of a precipice. We must wish you good-morning now, Mrs. Lyons, and
it is probable that you will very shortly hear from us again.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Our case becomes rounded off, and difficulty after difficulty thins
away in front of us,''  (<font color='red'><b>Holmes/Mr. Holmes/Sherlock Holmes</b></font>)</div>said Holmes as we stood waiting for the arrival of
the express from town. <div class="bookquote">``I shall soon be in the position of being able
to put into a single connected narrative one of the most singular
and sensational crimes of modern times. Students of criminology will
remember the analogous incidents in Godno, in Little Russia, in the year
`66, and of course there are the Anderson murders in North Carolina, but
this case possesses some features which are entirely its own. Even now
we have no clear case against this very wily man. But I shall be very
much surprised if it is not clear enough before we go to bed this
night.''

 (<font color='red'><b>a man</b></font>)</div><p/>The London express came roaring into the station, and a small, wiry
bulldog of a man had sprung from a first-class carriage. We all three
shook hands, and I saw at once from the reverential way in which
Lestrade gazed at my companion that he (<font color='blue'><b>companion</b></font>) had learned a good deal since
the days when they had first worked together. I could well remember
the scorn which the theories of the reasoner used then to excite in the
practical man.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Anything good?''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) asked.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``The biggest thing for years,''  (<font color='red'><b>Holmes/Mr. Holmes/Sherlock Holmes</b></font>)</div>said Holmes. <div class="bookquote">``We have two hours before
we need think of starting. I think we might employ it in getting some
dinner and then, Lestrade, we will take the London fog out of your
throat by giving you a breath of the pure night air of Dartmoor. Never
been there? Ah, well, I don't suppose you will forget your first visit.''




 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/>Chapter 14. The Hound of the Baskervilles



<p/>One of Sherlock Holmes's defects--if, indeed, one may call it a
defect--was that he (<font color='blue'><b>Holmes</b></font>) was exceedingly loath to communicate his (<font color='blue'><b>Holmes</b></font>) full plans
to any other person until the instant of their fulfilment. Partly it
came no doubt from his (<font color='blue'><b>Holmes</b></font>) own masterful nature, which loved to dominate and
surprise those who were around him (<font color='blue'><b>Holmes</b></font>). Partly also from his (<font color='blue'><b>Holmes</b></font>) professional
caution, which urged him (<font color='blue'><b>Holmes</b></font>) never to take any chances. The result, however,
was very trying for those who were acting as his (<font color='blue'><b>Holmes</b></font>) agents and assistants.
I had often suffered under it, but never more so than during that long
drive in the darkness. The great ordeal was in front of us; at last we
were about to make our final effort, and yet Holmes had said nothing,
and I could only surmise what his (<font color='blue'><b>Holmes</b></font>) course of action would be. My nerves
thrilled with anticipation when at last the cold wind upon our faces and
the dark, void spaces on either side of the narrow road told me that we
were back upon the moor once again. Every stride of the horses and every
turn of the wheels was taking us nearer to our supreme adventure.

<p/>Our conversation was hampered by the presence of the driver of the hired
wagonette, so that we were forced to talk of trivial matters when our
nerves were tense with emotion and anticipation. It was a relief to me,
after that unnatural restraint, when we at last passed Frankland's
house and knew that we were drawing near to the Hall and to the scene
of action. We did not drive up to the door but got down near the gate of
the avenue. The wagonette was paid off and ordered to return to Coombe
Tracey forthwith, while we started to walk to Merripit House.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Are you armed, Lestrade?''

 (<font color='red'><b>The detective</b></font>)</div><p/>The little detective smiled. <div class="bookquote">``As long as I have my trousers I have a
hip-pocket, and as long as I have my hip-pocket I have something in it.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Good! My friend and I are also ready for emergencies.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``You're mighty close about this affair, Mr. Holmes. What's the game
now?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``A waiting game.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``My word, it does not seem a very cheerful place,''  (<font color='red'><b>the detective</b></font>)</div>said the detective
with a shiver, glancing round him (<font color='blue'><b>detective</b></font>) at the gloomy slopes of the hill and
at the huge lake of fog which lay over the Grimpen Mire. <div class="bookquote">``I see the
lights of a house ahead of us.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``That is Merripit House and the end of our journey. I must request you
to walk on tiptoe and not to talk above a whisper.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Holmes/Mr. Holmes/Sherlock Holmes</b></font>)</div><p/>We moved cautiously along the track as if we were bound for the house,
but Holmes halted us when we were about two hundred yards from it.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``This will do,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>said he (<font color='blue'><b>Holmes</b></font>). <div class="bookquote">``These rocks upon the right make an admirable
screen.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``We are to wait here?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Yes, we shall make our little ambush here. Get into this hollow,
Lestrade. You have been inside the house, have you not, Watson? Can you
tell the position of the rooms? What are those latticed windows at this
end?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I think they are the kitchen windows.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``And the one beyond, which shines so brightly?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``That is certainly the dining-room.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``The blinds are up. You know the lie of the land best. Creep forward
quietly and see what they are doing--but for heaven's sake don't let
them know that they are watched!''

 (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div><p/>I tiptoed down the path and stooped behind the low wall which surrounded
the stunted orchard. Creeping in its shadow I reached a point whence I
could look straight through the uncurtained window.

<p/>There were only two men in the room, Sir Henry and Stapleton. They sat
with their profiles towards me on either side of the round table. Both
of them were smoking cigars, and coffee and wine were in front of them.
Stapleton was talking with animation, but the baronet looked pale and
distrait. Perhaps the thought of that lonely walk across the ill-omened
moor was weighing heavily upon his (<font color='blue'><b>Stapleton</b></font>) mind.

<p/>As I watched them Stapleton rose and left the room, while Sir Henry
filled his (<font color='blue'><b>Henry</b></font>) glass again and leaned back in his (<font color='blue'><b>Henry</b></font>) chair, puffing at his (<font color='blue'><b>Henry</b></font>)
cigar. I heard the creak of a door and the crisp sound of boots upon
gravel. The steps passed along the path on the other side of the wall
under which I crouched. Looking over, I saw the naturalist pause at the
door of an out-house in the corner of the orchard. A key turned in
a lock, and as he (<font color='blue'><b>naturalist</b></font>) passed in there was a curious scuffling noise from
within. He (<font color='blue'><b>naturalist</b></font>) was only a minute or so inside, and then I heard the key turn
once more and he (<font color='blue'><b>naturalist</b></font>) passed me and reentered the house. I saw him (<font color='blue'><b>naturalist</b></font>) rejoin his (<font color='blue'><b>naturalist</b></font>)
guest, and I crept quietly back to where my companions were waiting to
tell them what I had seen.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``You say, Watson, that the lady is not there?''  (<font color='red'><b>Holmes/Mr. Holmes/Sherlock Holmes</b></font>)</div>Holmes asked when I had
finished my report.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``No.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Where can she (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) be, then, since there is no light in any other room
except the kitchen?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I cannot think where she (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) is.''

 (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div><p/>I have said that over the great Grimpen Mire there hung a dense, white
fog. It was drifting slowly in our direction and banked itself up like a
wall on that side of us, low but thick and well defined. The moon shone
on it, and it looked like a great shimmering ice-field, with the heads
of the distant tors as rocks borne upon its surface. Holmes's face
was turned towards it, and he (<font color='blue'><b>Holmes</b></font>) muttered impatiently as he (<font color='blue'><b>Holmes</b></font>) watched its
sluggish drift.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``It's moving towards us, Watson.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Is that serious?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Very serious, indeed--the one thing upon earth which could have
disarranged my plans. He (<font color='blue'><b>Watson</b></font>) can't be very long, now. It is already ten
o’clock. Our success and even his (<font color='blue'><b>Watson</b></font>) life may depend upon his (<font color='blue'><b>Watson</b></font>) coming out
before the fog is over the path.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/>The night was clear and fine above us. The stars shone cold and bright,
while a half-moon bathed the whole scene in a soft, uncertain light.
Before us lay the dark bulk of the house, its serrated roof and
bristling chimneys hard outlined against the silver-spangled sky. Broad
bars of golden light from the lower windows stretched across the orchard
and the moor. One of them was suddenly shut off. The servants had left
the kitchen. There only remained the lamp in the dining-room where the
two men, the murderous host and the unconscious guest, still chatted
over their cigars.

<p/>Every minute that white woolly plain which covered one-half of the moor
was drifting closer and closer to the house. Already the first thin
wisps of it were curling across the golden square of the lighted window.
The farther wall of the orchard was already invisible, and the trees
were standing out of a swirl of white vapour. As we watched it the
fog-wreaths came crawling round both corners of the house and rolled
slowly into one dense bank on which the upper floor and the roof
floated like a strange ship upon a shadowy sea. Holmes struck his (<font color='blue'><b>Holmes</b></font>) hand
passionately upon the rock in front of us and stamped his (<font color='blue'><b>Holmes</b></font>) feet in his (<font color='blue'><b>Holmes</b></font>)
impatience.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``If he (<font color='blue'><b>Watson</b></font>) isn't out in a quarter of an hour the path will be covered. In
half an hour we won't be able to see our hands in front of us.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Shall we move farther back upon higher ground?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Yes, I think it would be as well.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/>So as the fog-bank flowed onward we fell back before it until we were
half a mile from the house, and still that dense white sea, with the
moon silvering its upper edge, swept slowly and inexorably on.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``We are going too far,''  (<font color='red'><b>Holmes/Mr. Holmes/Sherlock Holmes</b></font>)</div>said Holmes. <div class="bookquote">``We dare not take the chance of his (<font color='blue'><b>Watson</b></font>)
being overtaken before he (<font color='blue'><b>Watson</b></font>) can reach us. At all costs we must hold our
ground where we are.''  (<font color='red'><b>He</b></font>)</div>He (<font color='blue'><b>Holmes</b></font>) dropped on his (<font color='blue'><b>Holmes</b></font>) knees and clapped his (<font color='blue'><b>Holmes</b></font>) ear to the
ground. <div class="bookquote">``Thank God, I think that I hear him (<font color='blue'><b>God</b></font>) coming.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/>A sound of quick steps broke the silence of the moor. Crouching among
the stones we stared intently at the silver-tipped bank in front of us.
The steps grew louder, and through the fog, as through a curtain, there
stepped the man whom we were awaiting. He (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) looked round him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) in surprise
as he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) emerged into the clear, starlit night. Then he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) came swiftly along
the path, passed close to where we lay, and went on up the long slope
behind us. As he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) walked he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) glanced continually over either shoulder,
like a man who is ill at ease.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Hist!''  (<font color='red'><b>Holmes/Mr. Holmes/Sherlock Holmes</b></font>)</div>cried Holmes, and I heard the sharp click of a cocking pistol.
<div class="bookquote">``Look out! It's coming!''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/>There was a thin, crisp, continuous patter from somewhere in the heart
of that crawling bank. The cloud was within fifty yards of where we lay,
and we glared at it, all three, uncertain what horror was about to break
from the heart of it. I was at Holmes's elbow, and I glanced for an
instant at his (<font color='blue'><b>Holmes</b></font>) face. It was pale and exultant, his (<font color='blue'><b>Holmes</b></font>) eyes shining brightly
in the moonlight. But suddenly they started forward in a rigid, fixed
stare, and his (<font color='blue'><b>Holmes</b></font>) lips parted in amazement. At the same instant Lestrade
gave a yell of terror and threw himself face downward upon the ground.
I sprang to my feet, my inert hand grasping my pistol, my mind paralyzed
by the dreadful shape which had sprung out upon us from the shadows of
the fog. A hound it was, an enormous coal-black hound, but not such a
hound as mortal eyes have ever seen. Fire burst from its open mouth, its
eyes glowed with a smouldering glare, its muzzle and hackles and dewlap
were outlined in flickering flame. Never in the delirious dream of
a disordered brain could anything more savage, more appalling, more
hellish be conceived than that dark form and savage face which broke
upon us out of the wall of fog.

<p/>With long bounds the huge black creature was leaping down the track,
following hard upon the footsteps of our friend. So paralyzed were we by
the apparition that we allowed him (<font color='blue'><b>friend</b></font>) to pass before we had recovered our
nerve. Then Holmes and I both fired together, and the creature gave a
hideous howl, which showed that one at least had hit him (<font color='blue'><b>Holmes</b></font>). He (<font color='blue'><b>Holmes</b></font>) did not
pause, however, but bounded onward. Far away on the path we saw Sir
Henry looking back, his (<font color='blue'><b>Henry</b></font>) face white in the moonlight, his (<font color='blue'><b>Henry</b></font>) hands raised in
horror, glaring helplessly at the frightful thing which was hunting him (<font color='blue'><b>Henry</b></font>)
down. But that cry of pain from the hound had blown all our fears to the
winds. If he (<font color='blue'><b>Henry</b></font>) was vulnerable he (<font color='blue'><b>Henry</b></font>) was mortal, and if we could wound him (<font color='blue'><b>Henry</b></font>) we
could kill him (<font color='blue'><b>Henry</b></font>). Never have I seen a man run as Holmes ran that night. I
am reckoned fleet of foot, but he (<font color='blue'><b>Holmes</b></font>) outpaced me as much as I outpaced the
little professional. In front of us as we flew up the track we heard
scream after scream from Sir Henry and the deep roar of the hound. I was
in time to see the beast spring upon its victim, hurl him (<font color='blue'><b>victim</b></font>) to the ground,
and worry at his (<font color='blue'><b>victim</b></font>) throat. But the next instant Holmes had emptied five
barrels of his (<font color='blue'><b>Holmes</b></font>) revolver into the creature's flank. With a last howl of
agony and a vicious snap in the air, it rolled upon its back, four feet
pawing furiously, and then fell limp upon its side. I stooped, panting,
and pressed my pistol to the dreadful, shimmering head, but it was
useless to press the trigger. The giant hound was dead.

<p/>Sir Henry lay insensible where he (<font color='blue'><b>Henry</b></font>) had fallen. We tore away his (<font color='blue'><b>Henry</b></font>) collar,
and Holmes breathed a prayer of gratitude when we saw that there was
no sign of a wound and that the rescue had been in time. Already our
friend's eyelids shivered and he (<font color='blue'><b>friend</b></font>) made a feeble effort to move. Lestrade
thrust his (<font color='blue'><b>friend</b></font>) brandy-flask between the baronet's teeth, and two frightened
eyes were looking up at us.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``My God!''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>friend</b></font>) whispered. <div class="bookquote">``What was it? What, in heaven's name, was it?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``It's dead, whatever it is,''  (<font color='red'><b>Holmes/Mr. Holmes/Sherlock Holmes</b></font>)</div>said Holmes. <div class="bookquote">``We've laid the family ghost
once and forever.''

 (<font color='red'><b>a creature</b></font>)</div><p/>In mere size and strength it was a terrible creature which was lying
stretched before us. It was not a pure bloodhound and it was not a pure
mastiff; but it appeared to be a combination of the two--gaunt, savage,
and as large as a small lioness. Even now in the stillness of death,
the huge jaws seemed to be dripping with a bluish flame and the small,
deep-set, cruel eyes were ringed with fire. I placed my hand upon the
glowing muzzle, and as I held them up my own fingers smouldered and
gleamed in the darkness.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Phosphorus,''  (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div>I said.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``A cunning preparation of it,''  (<font color='red'><b>Holmes/Mr. Holmes/Sherlock Holmes</b></font>)</div>said Holmes, sniffing at the dead animal.
<div class="bookquote">``There is no smell which might have interfered with his (<font color='blue'><b>God</b></font>) power of scent.
We owe you a deep apology, Sir Henry, for having exposed you to this
fright. I was prepared for a hound, but not for such a creature as this.
And the fog gave us little time to receive him (<font color='blue'><b>Henry</b></font>).''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``You have saved my life.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Having first endangered it. Are you strong enough to stand?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Give me another mouthful of that brandy and I shall be ready for
anything. So! Now, if you will help me up. What do you propose to do?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``To leave you here. You are not fit for further adventures tonight. If
you will wait, one or other of us will go back with you to the Hall.''

 (<font color='red'><b>He</b></font>)</div><p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Holmes</b></font>) tried to stagger to his (<font color='blue'><b>Holmes</b></font>) feet; but he (<font color='blue'><b>Holmes</b></font>) was still ghastly pale and
trembling in every limb. We helped him (<font color='blue'><b>Holmes</b></font>) to a rock, where he (<font color='blue'><b>Holmes</b></font>) sat shivering
with his (<font color='blue'><b>Holmes</b></font>) face buried in his (<font color='blue'><b>Holmes</b></font>) hands.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``We must leave you now,''  (<font color='red'><b>Holmes/Mr. Holmes/Sherlock Holmes</b></font>)</div>said Holmes. ``The rest of our work must be
done, and every moment is of importance. We have our case, and now we
only want our man.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``It's a thousand to one against our finding him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) at the house,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Holmes</b></font>)
continued as we retraced our steps swiftly down the path. <div class="bookquote">``Those shots
must have told him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) that the game was up.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``We were some distance off, and this fog may have deadened them.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``He (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) followed the hound to call him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) off--of that you may be certain. No,
no, he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>)'s gone by this time! But we'll search the house and make sure.''

 (<font color='red'><b>a manservant</b></font>)</div><p/>The front door was open, so we rushed in and hurried from room to
room to the amazement of a doddering old manservant, who met us in the
passage. There was no light save in the dining-room, but Holmes caught
up the lamp and left no corner of the house unexplored. No sign could we
see of the man whom we were chasing. On the upper floor, however, one of
the bedroom doors was locked.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``There's someone in here,''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>cried Lestrade. <div class="bookquote">``I can hear a movement. Open
this door!''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/>A faint moaning and rustling came from within. Holmes struck the door
just over the lock with the flat of his (<font color='blue'><b>Holmes</b></font>) foot and it flew open. Pistol in
hand, we all three rushed into the room.

<p/>But there was no sign within it of that desperate and defiant villain
whom we expected to see. Instead we were faced by an object so strange
and so unexpected that we stood for a moment staring at it in amazement.

<p/>The room had been fashioned into a small museum, and the walls were
lined by a number of glass-topped cases full of that collection of
butterflies and moths the formation of which had been the relaxation of
this complex and dangerous man. In the centre of this room there was an
upright beam, which had been placed at some period as a support for the
old worm-eaten baulk of timber which spanned the roof. To this post a
figure was tied, so swathed and muffled in the sheets which had been
used to secure it that one could not for the moment tell whether it
was that of a man or a woman. One towel passed round the throat and was
secured at the back of the pillar. Another covered the lower part of
the face, and over it two dark eyes--eyes full of grief and shame and a
dreadful questioning--stared back at us. In a minute we had torn off
the gag, unswathed the bonds, and Mrs. Stapleton sank upon the floor in
front of us. As her (<font color='blue'><b>Stapleton</b></font>) beautiful head fell upon her (<font color='blue'><b>Stapleton</b></font>) chest I saw the clear
red weal of a whiplash across her (<font color='blue'><b>Stapleton</b></font>) neck.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``The brute!''  (<font color='red'><b>Holmes/Mr. Holmes/Sherlock Holmes</b></font>)</div>cried Holmes. <div class="bookquote">``Here, Lestrade, your brandy-bottle! Put her (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>)
in the chair! She (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) has fainted from ill-usage and exhaustion.''

 (<font color='red'><b>She</b></font>)</div><p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>Stapleton</b></font>) opened her (<font color='blue'><b>Stapleton</b></font>) eyes again.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Is he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) safe?''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Stapleton</b></font>) asked. <div class="bookquote">``Has he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) escaped?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``He (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) cannot escape us, madam.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``No, no, I did not mean my husband. Sir Henry? Is he (<font color='blue'><b>Henry</b></font>) safe?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Yes.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``And the hound?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``It is dead.''

 (<font color='red'><b>She</b></font>)</div><p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>Stapleton</b></font>) gave a long sigh of satisfaction.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Thank God! Thank God! Oh, this villain! See how he (<font color='blue'><b>God</b></font>) has treated me!''
 (<font color='red'><b>She</b></font>)</div>She (<font color='blue'><b>Stapleton</b></font>) shot her (<font color='blue'><b>Stapleton</b></font>) arms out from her (<font color='blue'><b>Stapleton</b></font>) sleeves, and we saw with horror that they
were all mottled with bruises. <div class="bookquote">``But this is nothing--nothing! It is my
mind and soul that he (<font color='blue'><b>God</b></font>) has tortured and defiled. I could endure it all,
ill-usage, solitude, a life of deception, everything, as long as I could
still cling to the hope that I had his (<font color='blue'><b>God</b></font>) love, but now I know that in
this also I have been his (<font color='blue'><b>God</b></font>) dupe and his (<font color='blue'><b>God</b></font>) tool.''  (<font color='red'><b>She</b></font>)</div>She (<font color='blue'><b>Stapleton</b></font>) broke into passionate
sobbing as she (<font color='blue'><b>Stapleton</b></font>) spoke.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``You bear him (<font color='blue'><b>God</b></font>) no good will, madam,''  (<font color='red'><b>Holmes/Mr. Holmes/Sherlock Holmes</b></font>)</div>said Holmes. <div class="bookquote">``Tell us then where we
shall find him (<font color='blue'><b>God</b></font>). If you have ever aided him (<font color='blue'><b>God</b></font>) in evil, help us now and so
atone.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``There is but one place where he (<font color='blue'><b>God</b></font>) can have fled,''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Stapleton</b></font>) answered. <div class="bookquote">``There is
an old tin mine on an island in the heart of the mire. It was there that
he (<font color='blue'><b>God</b></font>) kept his (<font color='blue'><b>God</b></font>) hound and there also he (<font color='blue'><b>God</b></font>) had made preparations so that he (<font color='blue'><b>God</b></font>)
might have a refuge. That is where he (<font color='blue'><b>God</b></font>) would fly.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/>The fog-bank lay like white wool against the window. Holmes held the
lamp towards it.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``See,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>said he (<font color='blue'><b>Holmes</b></font>). <div class="bookquote">``No one could find his (<font color='blue'><b>God</b></font>) way into the Grimpen Mire
tonight.''

 (<font color='red'><b>She</b></font>)</div><p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>Stapleton</b></font>) laughed and clapped her (<font color='blue'><b>Stapleton</b></font>) hands. Her (<font color='blue'><b>Stapleton</b></font>) eyes and teeth gleamed with
fierce merriment.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``He (<font color='blue'><b>God</b></font>) may find his (<font color='blue'><b>God</b></font>) way in, but never out,''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Stapleton</b></font>) cried. <div class="bookquote">``How can he (<font color='blue'><b>God</b></font>) see the
guiding wands tonight? We planted them together, he (<font color='blue'><b>God</b></font>) and I, to mark the
pathway through the mire. Oh, if I could only have plucked them out
today. Then indeed you would have had him (<font color='blue'><b>God</b></font>) at your mercy!''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/>It was evident to us that all pursuit was in vain until the fog had
lifted. Meanwhile we left Lestrade in possession of the house while
Holmes and I went back with the baronet to Baskerville Hall. The story
of the Stapletons could no longer be withheld from him (<font color='blue'><b>Holmes</b></font>), but he (<font color='blue'><b>Holmes</b></font>) took
the blow bravely when he (<font color='blue'><b>Holmes</b></font>) learned the truth about the woman whom he (<font color='blue'><b>Holmes</b></font>) had
loved. But the shock of the night's adventures had shattered his (<font color='blue'><b>Holmes</b></font>) nerves,
and before morning he (<font color='blue'><b>Holmes</b></font>) lay delirious in a high fever under the care of
Dr. Mortimer. The two of them were destined to travel together round the
world before Sir Henry had become once more the hale, hearty man that he (<font color='blue'><b>Henry</b></font>)
had been before he (<font color='blue'><b>Henry</b></font>) became master of that ill-omened estate.

<p/>And now I come rapidly to the conclusion of this singular narrative, in
which I have tried to make the reader share those dark fears and vague
surmises which clouded our lives so long and ended in so tragic a
manner. On the morning after the death of the hound the fog had lifted
and we were guided by Mrs. Stapleton to the point where they had found
a pathway through the bog. It helped us to realize the horror of this
woman's life when we saw the eagerness and joy with which she (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) laid us
on her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) husband's track. We left her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) standing upon the thin peninsula of
firm, peaty soil which tapered out into the widespread bog. From the
end of it a small wand planted here and there showed where the path
zigzagged from tuft to tuft of rushes among those green-scummed pits
and foul quagmires which barred the way to the stranger. Rank reeds and
lush, slimy water-plants sent an odour of decay and a heavy miasmatic
vapour onto our faces, while a false step plunged us more than once
thigh-deep into the dark, quivering mire, which shook for yards in soft
undulations around our feet. Its tenacious grip plucked at our heels as
we walked, and when we sank into it it was as if some malignant hand was
tugging us down into those obscene depths, so grim and purposeful was
the clutch in which it held us. Once only we saw a trace that someone
had passed that perilous way before us. From amid a tuft of cotton grass
which bore it up out of the slime some dark thing was projecting. Holmes
sank to his (<font color='blue'><b>Holmes</b></font>) waist as he (<font color='blue'><b>Holmes</b></font>) stepped from the path to seize it, and had we
not been there to drag him (<font color='blue'><b>Holmes</b></font>) out he (<font color='blue'><b>Holmes</b></font>) could never have set his (<font color='blue'><b>Holmes</b></font>) foot
upon firm land again. He (<font color='blue'><b>Holmes</b></font>) held an old black boot in the air. <div class="bookquote">``Meyers,
Toronto,''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>was printed on the leather inside.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``It is worth a mud bath,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>said he (<font color='blue'><b>Holmes</b></font>). <div class="bookquote">``It is our friend Sir Henry's missing
boot.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Thrown there by Stapleton in his (<font color='blue'><b>Stapleton</b></font>) flight.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Exactly. He (<font color='blue'><b>Stapleton</b></font>) retained it in his (<font color='blue'><b>Stapleton</b></font>) hand after using it to set the hound
upon the track. He (<font color='blue'><b>Stapleton</b></font>) fled when he (<font color='blue'><b>Stapleton</b></font>) knew the game was up, still clutching
it. And he (<font color='blue'><b>Stapleton</b></font>) hurled it away at this point of his (<font color='blue'><b>Stapleton</b></font>) flight. We know at least
that he (<font color='blue'><b>Stapleton</b></font>) came so far in safety.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/>But more than that we were never destined to know, though there was much
which we might surmise. There was no chance of finding footsteps in the
mire, for the rising mud oozed swiftly in upon them, but as we at last
reached firmer ground beyond the morass we all looked eagerly for them.
But no slightest sign of them ever met our eyes. If the earth told a
true story, then Stapleton never reached that island of refuge towards
which he (<font color='blue'><b>Stapleton</b></font>) struggled through the fog upon that last night. Somewhere in
the heart of the great Grimpen Mire, down in the foul slime of the
huge morass which had sucked him (<font color='blue'><b>Stapleton</b></font>) in, this cold and cruel-hearted man is
forever buried.

<p/>Many traces we found of him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) in the bog-girt island where he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) had hid his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>)
savage ally. A huge driving-wheel and a shaft half-filled with rubbish
showed the position of an abandoned mine. Beside it were the crumbling
remains of the cottages of the miners, driven away no doubt by the foul
reek of the surrounding swamp. In one of these a staple and chain with
a quantity of gnawed bones showed where the animal had been confined.
A skeleton with a tangle of brown hair adhering to it lay among the
debris.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``A dog!''  (<font color='red'><b>Holmes/Mr. Holmes/Sherlock Holmes</b></font>)</div>said Holmes. <div class="bookquote">``By Jove, a curly-haired spaniel. Poor Mortimer
will never see his (<font color='blue'><b>Mortimer</b></font>) pet again. Well, I do not know that this place
contains any secret which we have not already fathomed. He (<font color='blue'><b>Mortimer</b></font>) could hide
his (<font color='blue'><b>Mortimer</b></font>) hound, but he (<font color='blue'><b>Mortimer</b></font>) could not hush its voice, and hence came those cries
which even in daylight were not pleasant to hear. On an emergency he (<font color='blue'><b>Mortimer</b></font>)
could keep the hound in the out-house at Merripit, but it was always a
risk, and it was only on the supreme day, which he (<font color='blue'><b>Mortimer</b></font>) regarded as the end
of all his (<font color='blue'><b>Mortimer</b></font>) efforts, that he (<font color='blue'><b>Mortimer</b></font>) dared do it. This paste in the tin is no
doubt the luminous mixture with which the creature was daubed. It was
suggested, of course, by the story of the family hell-hound, and by the
desire to frighten old Sir Charles to death. No wonder the poor devil of
a convict ran and screamed, even as our friend did, and as we ourselves
might have done, when he (<font color='blue'><b>friend</b></font>) saw such a creature bounding through the
darkness of the moor upon his (<font color='blue'><b>friend</b></font>) track. It was a cunning device, for, apart
from the chance of driving your victim to his (<font color='blue'><b>victim</b></font>) death, what peasant would
venture to inquire too closely into such a creature should he (<font color='blue'><b>victim</b></font>) get sight
of it, as many have done, upon the moor? I said it in London, Watson,
and I say it again now, that never yet have we helped to hunt down a
more dangerous man than he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) who is lying yonder'' (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>--he (<font color='blue'><b>Holmes</b></font>) swept his (<font color='blue'><b>Holmes</b></font>) long arm
towards the huge mottled expanse of green-splotched bog which stretched
away until it merged into the russet slopes of the moor.




<p/>Chapter 15. A Retrospection



<p/>It was the end of November, and Holmes and I sat, upon a raw and foggy
night, on either side of a blazing fire in our sitting-room in Baker
Street. Since the tragic upshot of our visit to Devonshire he (<font color='blue'><b>Baker</b></font>) had been
engaged in two affairs of the utmost importance, in the first of which
he (<font color='blue'><b>Baker</b></font>) had exposed the atrocious conduct of Colonel Upwood in connection
with the famous card scandal of the Nonpareil Club, while in the second
he (<font color='blue'><b>Colonel</b></font>) had defended the unfortunate Mme. Montpensier from the charge
of murder which hung over her (<font color='blue'><b>our</b></font>) in connection with the death of her (<font color='blue'><b>our</b></font>)
step-daughter, Mlle. Carere, the young lady who, as it will be
remembered, was found six months later alive and married in New York.
My friend was in excellent spirits over the success which had attended
a succession of difficult and important cases, so that I was able to
induce him (<font color='blue'><b>friend</b></font>) to discuss the details of the Baskerville mystery. I had
waited patiently for the opportunity for I was aware that he (<font color='blue'><b>friend</b></font>) would never
permit cases to overlap, and that his (<font color='blue'><b>friend</b></font>) clear and logical mind would not
be drawn from its present work to dwell upon memories of the past. Sir
Henry and Dr. Mortimer were, however, in London, on their way to that
long voyage which had been recommended for the restoration of his (<font color='blue'><b>Mortimer</b></font>)
shattered nerves. They had called upon us that very afternoon, so that
it was natural that the subject should come up for discussion.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``The whole course of events,''  (<font color='red'><b>Holmes/Mr. Holmes/Sherlock Holmes</b></font>)</div>said Holmes, <div class="bookquote">``from the point of view of
the man who called himself Stapleton was simple and direct, although
to us, who had no means in the beginning of knowing the motives of
his (<font color='blue'><b>Stapleton</b></font>) actions and could only learn part of the facts, it all appeared
exceedingly complex. I have had the advantage of two conversations with
Mrs. Stapleton, and the case has now been so entirely cleared up that I
am not aware that there is anything which has remained a secret to us.
You will find a few notes upon the matter under the heading B in my
indexed list of cases.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Holmes/Mr. Holmes/Sherlock Holmes</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Perhaps you would kindly give me a sketch of the course of events from
memory.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/>``Certainly, though I cannot guarantee that I carry all the facts in my
mind. Intense mental concentration has a curious way of blotting out
what has passed. The barrister who has his (<font color='blue'><b>barrister</b></font>) case at his (<font color='blue'><b>barrister</b></font>) fingers' ends and
is able to argue with an expert upon his (<font color='blue'><b>barrister</b></font>) own subject finds that a week
or two of the courts will drive it all out of his (<font color='blue'><b>barrister</b></font>) head once more. So
each of my cases displaces the last, and Mlle. Carere has blurred my
recollection of Baskerville Hall. Tomorrow some other little problem may
be submitted to my notice which will in turn dispossess the fair French
lady and the infamous Upwood. So far as the case of the hound goes,
however, I will give you the course of events as nearly as I can, and
you will suggest anything which I may have forgotten.

<p/>``My inquiries show beyond all question that the family portrait did not
lie, and that this fellow was indeed a Baskerville. He (<font color='blue'><b>fellow</b></font>) was a son of that
Rodger Baskerville, the younger brother of Sir Charles, who fled with
a sinister reputation to South America, where he (<font color='blue'><b>Charles</b></font>) was said to have died
unmarried. He (<font color='blue'><b>Charles</b></font>) did, as a matter of fact, marry, and had one child, this
fellow, whose real name is the same as his (<font color='blue'><b>fellow</b></font>) father's. He (<font color='blue'><b>fellow</b></font>) married Beryl
Garcia, one of the beauties of Costa Rica, and, having purloined a
considerable sum of public money, he (<font color='blue'><b>Garcia</b></font>) changed his (<font color='blue'><b>Garcia</b></font>) name to Vandeleur and
fled to England, where he (<font color='blue'><b>Garcia</b></font>) established a school in the east of Yorkshire.
His (<font color='blue'><b>Garcia</b></font>) reason for attempting this special line of business was that he (<font color='blue'><b>Garcia</b></font>) had
struck up an acquaintance with a consumptive tutor upon the voyage
home, and that he (<font color='blue'><b>Garcia</b></font>) had used this man's ability to make the undertaking a
success. Fraser, the tutor, died however, and the school which had begun
well sank from disrepute into infamy. The Vandeleurs found it convenient
to change their name to Stapleton, and he (<font color='blue'><b>Stapleton</b></font>) brought the remains of his (<font color='blue'><b>Stapleton</b></font>)
fortune, his (<font color='blue'><b>Stapleton</b></font>) schemes for the future, and his (<font color='blue'><b>Stapleton</b></font>) taste for entomology to
the south of England. I learned at the British Museum that he (<font color='blue'><b>Stapleton</b></font>) was a
recognized authority upon the subject, and that the name of Vandeleur
has been permanently attached to a certain moth which he (<font color='blue'><b>Stapleton</b></font>) had, in his (<font color='blue'><b>Stapleton</b></font>)
Yorkshire days, been the first to describe.

<p/>``We now come to that portion of his (<font color='blue'><b>Stapleton</b></font>) life which has proved to be of such
intense interest to us. The fellow had evidently made inquiry and found
that only two lives intervened between him (<font color='blue'><b>fellow</b></font>) and a valuable estate. When
he (<font color='blue'><b>fellow</b></font>) went to Devonshire his (<font color='blue'><b>fellow</b></font>) plans were, I believe, exceedingly hazy, but
that he (<font color='blue'><b>fellow</b></font>) meant mischief from the first is evident from the way in which
he (<font color='blue'><b>fellow</b></font>) took his (<font color='blue'><b>fellow</b></font>) wife with him (<font color='blue'><b>fellow</b></font>) in the character of his (<font color='blue'><b>fellow</b></font>) sister. The idea of
using her (<font color='blue'><b>sister</b></font>) as a decoy was clearly already in his (<font color='blue'><b>fellow</b></font>) mind, though he (<font color='blue'><b>fellow</b></font>) may not
have been certain how the details of his (<font color='blue'><b>fellow</b></font>) plot were to be arranged. He (<font color='blue'><b>fellow</b></font>)
meant in the end to have the estate, and he (<font color='blue'><b>fellow</b></font>) was ready to use any tool
or run any risk for that end. His (<font color='blue'><b>fellow</b></font>) first act was to establish himself as
near to his (<font color='blue'><b>fellow</b></font>) ancestral home as he (<font color='blue'><b>fellow</b></font>) could, and his (<font color='blue'><b>fellow</b></font>) second was to cultivate
a friendship with Sir Charles Baskerville and with the neighbours.

<p/>``The baronet himself told him (<font color='blue'><b>Baskerville</b></font>) about the family hound, and so prepared
the way for his (<font color='blue'><b>Baskerville</b></font>) own death. Stapleton, as I will continue to call him (<font color='blue'><b>Stapleton</b></font>),
knew that the old man's heart was weak and that a shock would kill him (<font color='blue'><b>Stapleton</b></font>).
So much he (<font color='blue'><b>Stapleton</b></font>) had learned from Dr. Mortimer. He (<font color='blue'><b>Stapleton</b></font>) had heard also that Sir
Charles was superstitious and had taken this grim legend very seriously.
His (<font color='blue'><b>Charles</b></font>) ingenious mind instantly suggested a way by which the baronet could
be done to death, and yet it would be hardly possible to bring home the
guilt to the real murderer.

<p/>``Having conceived the idea he (<font color='blue'><b>murderer</b></font>) proceeded to carry it out with
considerable finesse. An ordinary schemer would have been content
to work with a savage hound. The use of artificial means to make the
creature diabolical was a flash of genius upon his (<font color='blue'><b>genius</b></font>) part. The dog he (<font color='blue'><b>genius</b></font>)
bought in London from Ross and Mangles, the dealers in Fulham Road. It
was the strongest and most savage in their possession. He (<font color='blue'><b>genius</b></font>) brought it
down by the North Devon line and walked a great distance over the moor
so as to get it home without exciting any remarks. He (<font color='blue'><b>genius</b></font>) had already on his (<font color='blue'><b>genius</b></font>)
insect hunts learned to penetrate the Grimpen Mire, and so had found a
safe hiding-place for the creature. Here he (<font color='blue'><b>genius</b></font>) kennelled it and waited his (<font color='blue'><b>genius</b></font>)
chance.

<p/>``But it was some time coming. The old gentleman could not be decoyed
outside of his (<font color='blue'><b>gentleman</b></font>) grounds at night. Several times Stapleton lurked about
with his (<font color='blue'><b>Stapleton</b></font>) hound, but without avail. It was during these fruitless quests
that he (<font color='blue'><b>Stapleton</b></font>), or rather his (<font color='blue'><b>Stapleton</b></font>) ally, was seen by peasants, and that the legend
of the demon dog received a new confirmation. He (<font color='blue'><b>Stapleton</b></font>) had hoped that his (<font color='blue'><b>Stapleton</b></font>) wife
might lure Sir Charles to his (<font color='blue'><b>Stapleton</b></font>) ruin, but here she (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>) proved unexpectedly
independent. She (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>) would not endeavour to entangle the old gentleman in
a sentimental attachment which might deliver him (<font color='blue'><b>gentleman</b></font>) over to his (<font color='blue'><b>gentleman</b></font>) enemy.
Threats and even, I am sorry to say, blows refused to move her (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>). She (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>)
would have nothing to do with it, and for a time Stapleton was at a
deadlock.

<p/>``He (<font color='blue'><b>Stapleton</b></font>) found a way out of his (<font color='blue'><b>Stapleton</b></font>) difficulties through the chance that Sir
Charles, who had conceived a friendship for him (<font color='blue'><b>Charles</b></font>), made him (<font color='blue'><b>Charles</b></font>) the minister
of his (<font color='blue'><b>Charles</b></font>) charity in the case of this unfortunate woman, Mrs. Laura Lyons.
By representing himself as a single man he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) acquired complete influence
over her (<font color='blue'><b>Lyons</b></font>), and he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) gave her (<font color='blue'><b>Lyons</b></font>) to understand that in the event of her (<font color='blue'><b>Lyons</b></font>)
obtaining a divorce from her (<font color='blue'><b>Lyons</b></font>) husband he (<font color='blue'><b>husband</b></font>) would marry her (<font color='blue'><b>Lyons</b></font>). His (<font color='blue'><b>husband</b></font>) plans were
suddenly brought to a head by his (<font color='blue'><b>husband</b></font>) knowledge that Sir Charles was about
to leave the Hall on the advice of Dr. Mortimer, with whose opinion he (<font color='blue'><b>Mortimer</b></font>)
himself pretended to coincide. He (<font color='blue'><b>Mortimer</b></font>) must act at once, or his (<font color='blue'><b>Mortimer</b></font>) victim might
get beyond his (<font color='blue'><b>Mortimer</b></font>) power. He (<font color='blue'><b>Mortimer</b></font>) therefore put pressure upon Mrs. Lyons to
write this letter, imploring the old man to give her (<font color='blue'><b>Lyons</b></font>) an interview on
the evening before his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) departure for London. He (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) then, by a specious
argument, prevented her (<font color='blue'><b>Lyons</b></font>) from going, and so had the chance for which he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>)
had waited.

<p/>``Driving back in the evening from Coombe Tracey he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) was in time to get
his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) hound, to treat it with his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) infernal paint, and to bring the beast
round to the gate at which he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) had reason to expect that he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) would find
the old gentleman waiting. The dog, incited by its master, sprang over
the wicket-gate and pursued the unfortunate baronet, who fled screaming
down the yew alley. In that gloomy tunnel it must indeed have been a
dreadful sight to see that huge black creature, with its flaming jaws
and blazing eyes, bounding after its victim. He (<font color='blue'><b>victim</b></font>) fell dead at the end
of the alley from heart disease and terror. The hound had kept upon the
grassy border while the baronet had run down the path, so that no track
but the man's was visible. On seeing him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) lying still the creature had
probably approached to sniff at him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>), but finding him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) dead had turned
away again. It was then that it left the print which was actually
observed by Dr. Mortimer. The hound was called off and hurried away to
its lair in the Grimpen Mire, and a mystery was left which puzzled
the authorities, alarmed the countryside, and finally brought the case
within the scope of our observation.

<p/>``So much for the death of Sir Charles Baskerville. You perceive the
devilish cunning of it, for really it would be almost impossible to make
a case against the real murderer. His (<font color='blue'><b>murderer</b></font>) only accomplice was one who could
never give him (<font color='blue'><b>murderer</b></font>) away, and the grotesque, inconceivable nature of
the device only served to make it more effective. Both of the women
concerned in the case, Mrs. Stapleton and Mrs. Laura Lyons, were left
with a strong suspicion against Stapleton. Mrs. Stapleton knew that he (<font color='blue'><b>Stapleton</b></font>)
had designs upon the old man, and also of the existence of the hound.
Mrs. Lyons knew neither of these things, but had been impressed by the
death occurring at the time of an uncancelled appointment which was only
known to him (<font color='blue'><b>Stapleton</b></font>). However, both of them were under his (<font color='blue'><b>Stapleton</b></font>) influence, and he (<font color='blue'><b>Stapleton</b></font>) had
nothing to fear from them. The first half of his (<font color='blue'><b>Stapleton</b></font>) task was successfully
accomplished but the more difficult still remained.

<p/>``It is possible that Stapleton did not know of the existence of an heir
in Canada. In any case he (<font color='blue'><b>Stapleton</b></font>) would very soon learn it from his (<font color='blue'><b>Stapleton</b></font>) friend Dr.
Mortimer, and he (<font color='blue'><b>Stapleton</b></font>) was told by the latter all details about the arrival of
Henry Baskerville. Stapleton's first idea was that this young stranger
from Canada might possibly be done to death in London without coming
down to Devonshire at all. He (<font color='blue'><b>stranger</b></font>) distrusted his (<font color='blue'><b>stranger</b></font>) wife ever since she (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>) had
refused to help him (<font color='blue'><b>stranger</b></font>) in laying a trap for the old man, and he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) dared not
leave her (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>) long out of his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) sight for fear he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) should lose his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) influence
over her (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>). It was for this reason that he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) took her (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>) to London with him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>).
They lodged, I find, at the Mexborough Private Hotel, in Craven Street,
which was actually one of those called upon by my agent in search
of evidence. Here he (<font color='blue'><b>agent</b></font>) kept his (<font color='blue'><b>agent</b></font>) wife imprisoned in her (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>) room while
he (<font color='blue'><b>agent</b></font>), disguised in a beard, followed Dr. Mortimer to Baker Street and
afterwards to the station and to the Northumberland Hotel. His (<font color='blue'><b>Baker</b></font>) wife had
some inkling of his (<font color='blue'><b>Baker</b></font>) plans; but she (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>) had such a fear of her (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>) husband--a
fear founded upon brutal ill-treatment--that she (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>) dare not write to warn
the man whom she (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>) knew to be in danger. If the letter should fall into
Stapleton's hands her (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>) own life would not be safe. Eventually, as we
know, she (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>) adopted the expedient of cutting out the words which would
form the message, and addressing the letter in a disguised hand. It
reached the baronet, and gave him (<font color='blue'><b>Stapleton</b></font>) the first warning of his (<font color='blue'><b>Stapleton</b></font>) danger.

<p/>``It was very essential for Stapleton to get some article of Sir Henry's
attire so that, in case he (<font color='blue'><b>Stapleton</b></font>) was driven to use the dog, he (<font color='blue'><b>Stapleton</b></font>) might always
have the means of setting him (<font color='blue'><b>Stapleton</b></font>) upon his (<font color='blue'><b>Stapleton</b></font>) track. With characteristic
promptness and audacity he (<font color='blue'><b>Stapleton</b></font>) set about this at once, and we cannot doubt
that the boots or chamber-maid of the hotel was well bribed to help him (<font color='blue'><b>Stapleton</b></font>)
in his (<font color='blue'><b>Stapleton</b></font>) design. By chance, however, the first boot which was procured for
him (<font color='blue'><b>Stapleton</b></font>) was a new one and, therefore, useless for his (<font color='blue'><b>Stapleton</b></font>) purpose. He (<font color='blue'><b>Stapleton</b></font>) then had
it returned and obtained another--a most instructive incident, since it
proved conclusively to my mind that we were dealing with a real hound,
as no other supposition could explain this anxiety to obtain an old
boot and this indifference to a new one. The more outre and grotesque an
incident is the more carefully it deserves to be examined, and the very
point which appears to complicate a case is, when duly considered and
scientifically handled, the one which is most likely to elucidate it.

<p/>``Then we had the visit from our friends next morning, shadowed always
by Stapleton in the cab. From his (<font color='blue'><b>Stapleton</b></font>) knowledge of our rooms and of my
appearance, as well as from his (<font color='blue'><b>Stapleton</b></font>) general conduct, I am inclined to think
that Stapleton's career of crime has been by no means limited to this
single Baskerville affair. It is suggestive that during the last three
years there have been four considerable burglaries in the west country,
for none of which was any criminal ever arrested. The last of these, at
Folkestone Court, in May, was remarkable for the cold-blooded pistolling
of the page, who surprised the masked and solitary burglar. I cannot
doubt that Stapleton recruited his (<font color='blue'><b>Stapleton</b></font>) waning resources in this fashion, and
that for years he (<font color='blue'><b>Stapleton</b></font>) has been a desperate and dangerous man.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``We had an example of his (<font color='blue'><b>Stapleton</b></font>) readiness of resource that morning when he (<font color='blue'><b>Stapleton</b></font>) got
away from us so successfully, and also of his (<font color='blue'><b>Stapleton</b></font>) audacity in sending back
my own name to me through the cabman. From that moment he (<font color='blue'><b>Stapleton</b></font>) understood
that I had taken over the case in London, and that therefore there was
no chance for him (<font color='blue'><b>Stapleton</b></font>) there. He (<font color='blue'><b>Stapleton</b></font>) returned to Dartmoor and awaited the arrival
of the baronet.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``One moment!''  (<font color='red'><b>I.</b></font>)</div>said I. <div class="bookquote">``You have, no doubt, described the sequence
of events correctly, but there is one point which you have left
unexplained. What became of the hound when its master was in London?''

 (<font color='red'><b>I.</b></font>)</div><p/>``I have given some attention to this matter and it is undoubtedly of
importance. There can be no question that Stapleton had a confidant,
though it is unlikely that he (<font color='blue'><b>Stapleton</b></font>) ever placed himself in his (<font color='blue'><b>Stapleton</b></font>) power by
sharing all his (<font color='blue'><b>Stapleton</b></font>) plans with him (<font color='blue'><b>Stapleton</b></font>). There was an old manservant at Merripit
House, whose name was Anthony. His (<font color='blue'><b>Anthony</b></font>) connection with the Stapletons can
be traced for several years, as far back as the school-mastering days,
so that he (<font color='blue'><b>Anthony</b></font>) must have been aware that his (<font color='blue'><b>Anthony</b></font>) master and mistress were really
husband and wife. This man has disappeared and has escaped from the
country. It is suggestive that Anthony is not a common name in England,
while Antonio is so in all Spanish or Spanish-American countries. The
man, like Mrs. Stapleton herself, spoke good English, but with a curious
lisping accent. I have myself seen this old man cross the Grimpen
Mire by the path which Stapleton had marked out. It is very probable,
therefore, that in the absence of his (<font color='blue'><b>Stapleton</b></font>) master it was he (<font color='blue'><b>Stapleton</b></font>) who cared for the
hound, though he (<font color='blue'><b>Stapleton</b></font>) may never have known the purpose for which the beast
was used.

<p/>``The Stapletons then went down to Devonshire, whither they were soon
followed by Sir Henry and you. One word now as to how I stood myself at
that time. It may possibly recur to your memory that when I examined
the paper upon which the printed words were fastened I made a close
inspection for the water-mark. In doing so I held it within a few inches
of my eyes, and was conscious of a faint smell of the scent known as
white jessamine. There are seventy-five perfumes, which it is very
necessary that a criminal expert should be able to distinguish from each
other, and cases have more than once within my own experience depended
upon their prompt recognition. The scent suggested the presence of a
lady, and already my thoughts began to turn towards the Stapletons. Thus
I had made certain of the hound, and had guessed at the criminal before
ever we went to the west country.

<p/>``It was my game to watch Stapleton. It was evident, however, that I
could not do this if I were with you, since he (<font color='blue'><b>Stapleton</b></font>) would be keenly on his (<font color='blue'><b>Stapleton</b></font>)
guard. I deceived everybody, therefore, yourself included, and I came
down secretly when I was supposed to be in London. My hardships were
not so great as you imagined, though such trifling details must never
interfere with the investigation of a case. I stayed for the most
part at Coombe Tracey, and only used the hut upon the moor when it was
necessary to be near the scene of action. Cartwright had come down with
me, and in his (<font color='blue'><b>Cartwright</b></font>) disguise as a country boy he (<font color='blue'><b>Cartwright</b></font>) was of great assistance
to me. I was dependent upon him (<font color='blue'><b>Cartwright</b></font>) for food and clean linen. When I was
watching Stapleton, Cartwright was frequently watching you, so that I
was able to keep my hand upon all the strings.

<p/>``I have already told you that your reports reached me rapidly, being
forwarded instantly from Baker Street to Coombe Tracey. They were of
great service to me, and especially that one incidentally truthful piece
of biography of Stapleton's. I was able to establish the identity of
the man and the woman and knew at last exactly how I stood. The case
had been considerably complicated through the incident of the escaped
convict and the relations between him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) and the Barrymores. This also you
cleared up in a very effective way, though I had already come to the
same conclusions from my own observations.

<p/>``By the time that you discovered me upon the moor I had a complete
knowledge of the whole business, but I had not a case which could go to
a jury. Even Stapleton's attempt upon Sir Henry that night which ended
in the death of the unfortunate convict did not help us much in proving
murder against our man. There seemed to be no alternative but to
catch him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) red-handed, and to do so we had to use Sir Henry, alone and
apparently unprotected, as a bait. We did so, and at the cost of a
severe shock to our client we succeeded in completing our case and
driving Stapleton to his (<font color='blue'><b>Stapleton</b></font>) destruction. That Sir Henry should have been
exposed to this is, I must confess, a reproach to my management of the
case, but we had no means of foreseeing the terrible and paralyzing
spectacle which the beast presented, nor could we predict the fog which
enabled him (<font color='blue'><b>Henry</b></font>) to burst upon us at such short notice. We succeeded in our
object at a cost which both the specialist and Dr. Mortimer assure me
will be a temporary one. A long journey may enable our friend to recover
not only from his (<font color='blue'><b>friend</b></font>) shattered nerves but also from his (<font color='blue'><b>friend</b></font>) wounded feelings.
His (<font color='blue'><b>friend</b></font>) love for the lady was deep and sincere, and to him (<font color='blue'><b>friend</b></font>) the saddest part
of all this black business was that he (<font color='blue'><b>friend</b></font>) should have been deceived by her (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>).

<p/><div class="bookquote">``It only remains to indicate the part which she (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) had played throughout.
There can be no doubt that Stapleton exercised an influence over her (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>)
which may have been love or may have been fear, or very possibly both,
since they are by no means incompatible emotions. It was, at least,
absolutely effective. At his (<font color='blue'><b>Stapleton</b></font>) command she (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) consented to pass as his (<font color='blue'><b>Stapleton</b></font>)
sister, though he (<font color='blue'><b>Stapleton</b></font>) found the limits of his (<font color='blue'><b>Stapleton</b></font>) power over her (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) when he (<font color='blue'><b>Stapleton</b></font>)
endeavoured to make her (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) the direct accessory to murder. She (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) was ready to
warn Sir Henry so far as she (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) could without implicating her (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) husband, and
again and again she (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) tried to do so. Stapleton himself seems to have been
capable of jealousy, and when he (<font color='blue'><b>Stapleton</b></font>) saw the baronet paying court to the
lady, even though it was part of his (<font color='blue'><b>Stapleton</b></font>) own plan, still he (<font color='blue'><b>Stapleton</b></font>) could not help
interrupting with a passionate outburst which revealed the fiery soul
which his (<font color='blue'><b>Stapleton</b></font>) self-contained manner so cleverly concealed. By encouraging
the intimacy he (<font color='blue'><b>Stapleton</b></font>) made it certain that Sir Henry would frequently come
to Merripit House and that he (<font color='blue'><b>Henry</b></font>) would sooner or later get the opportunity
which he (<font color='blue'><b>Henry</b></font>) desired. On the day of the crisis, however, his (<font color='blue'><b>Henry</b></font>) wife turned
suddenly against him (<font color='blue'><b>Henry</b></font>). She (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>) had learned something of the death of the
convict, and she (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>) knew that the hound was being kept in the outhouse on
the evening that Sir Henry was coming to dinner. She (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>) taxed her (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>) husband
with his (<font color='blue'><b>Henry</b></font>) intended crime, and a furious scene followed in which he (<font color='blue'><b>Henry</b></font>) showed
her (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>) for the first time that she (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>) had a rival in his (<font color='blue'><b>Henry</b></font>) love. Her (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>) fidelity
turned in an instant to bitter hatred, and he (<font color='blue'><b>Henry</b></font>) saw that she (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>) would betray
him (<font color='blue'><b>Henry</b></font>). He (<font color='blue'><b>Henry</b></font>) tied her (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>) up, therefore, that she (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>) might have no chance of warning
Sir Henry, and he (<font color='blue'><b>Henry</b></font>) hoped, no doubt, that when the whole countryside put
down the baronet's death to the curse of his (<font color='blue'><b>Henry</b></font>) family, as they certainly
would do, he (<font color='blue'><b>Henry</b></font>) could win his (<font color='blue'><b>Henry</b></font>) wife back to accept an accomplished fact and
to keep silent upon what she (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>) knew. In this I fancy that in any case
he (<font color='blue'><b>Henry</b></font>) made a miscalculation, and that, if we had not been there, his (<font color='blue'><b>Henry</b></font>) doom
would none the less have been sealed. A woman of Spanish blood does
not condone such an injury so lightly. And now, my dear Watson, without
referring to my notes, I cannot give you a more detailed account of
this curious case. I do not know that anything essential has been left
unexplained.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``He (<font color='blue'><b>Watson</b></font>) could not hope to frighten Sir Henry to death as he (<font color='blue'><b>Henry</b></font>) had done the old
uncle with his (<font color='blue'><b>Henry</b></font>) bogie hound.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``The beast was savage and half-starved. If its appearance did not
frighten its victim to death, at least it would paralyze the resistance
which might be offered.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``No doubt. There only remains one difficulty. If Stapleton came into the
succession, how could he (<font color='blue'><b>Stapleton</b></font>) explain the fact that he (<font color='blue'><b>Stapleton</b></font>), the heir, had been
living unannounced under another name so close to the property? How
could he (<font color='blue'><b>Stapleton</b></font>) claim it without causing suspicion and inquiry?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``It is a formidable difficulty, and I fear that you ask too much when
you expect me to solve it. The past and the present are within the field
of my inquiry, but what a man may do in the future is a hard question
to answer. Mrs. Stapleton has heard her (<font color='blue'><b>Stapleton</b></font>) husband discuss the problem on
several occasions. There were three possible courses. He (<font color='blue'><b>husband</b></font>) might claim the
property from South America, establish his (<font color='blue'><b>husband</b></font>) identity before the British
authorities there and so obtain the fortune without ever coming to
England at all, or he (<font color='blue'><b>husband</b></font>) might adopt an elaborate disguise during the
short time that he (<font color='blue'><b>husband</b></font>) need be in London; or, again, he (<font color='blue'><b>husband</b></font>) might furnish an
accomplice with the proofs and papers, putting him (<font color='blue'><b>husband</b></font>) in as heir, and
retaining a claim upon some proportion of his (<font color='blue'><b>husband</b></font>) income. We cannot doubt
from what we know of him (<font color='blue'><b>husband</b></font>) that he (<font color='blue'><b>husband</b></font>) would have found some way out of the
difficulty. And now, my dear Watson, we have had some weeks of severe
work, and for one evening, I think, we may turn our thoughts into more
pleasant channels. I have a box for `Les Huguenots.' Have you heard the
De Reszkes? Might I trouble you then to be ready in half an hour, and we
can stop at Marcini's for a little dinner on the way?''
