Of course , he likes somebody else , at America , or at Tunbridge , or at Jericho , or somewhere . He is a prince in his own country , and ca n't think of marrying a poor half-pay officer 's daughter , with twopence to her fortune .

but since that fatal day of July , last year , and my return home , my mother never has been the same woman .

She hath plunged , more deeply than ever , into her books of devotion , out of which she only manages to extract grief and sadness , as I think . Such a gloom has fallen over our wretched Virginian house of Castlewood , that we all grew ill , and pale as ghosts , who inhabited it . Mountain told me , madam , that , for nights , my mother would not close her eyes . I have had her at my bedside , looking so ghastly , that I have started from my own sleep , fancying a ghost before me . By one means or other she has wrought herself into a state of excitement which if not delirium , is akin to it . I was again and again struck down by the fever , and all the Jesuits ' bark in America could not cure me . We have a tobacco-house and some land about the new town of Richmond , in our province , and went thither , as Williamsburg is no wholesomer than our own place ; and there I mended a little , but still did not get quite well , and the physicians strongly counselled a sea-voyage .

My poor children might be mortified , for indeed , in a few hours , the charming young man has made as much way as my poor things have been able to do in all their lives : but are they angry ? Willy hath taken him out to ride . This morning , was not Maria playing the harpsichord whilst my Fanny taught him the minuet ? ` Twas a charming young group , I assure you , and it brought tears into my eyes to look at the young creatures .
