The looms went slowish , and fashions did n't alter quite so fast ; I 'd a best suit that lasted me six years . Everything was on a lower scale , sir , -- in point of expenditure , I mean . It 's this steam , you see , that has made the difference ; it drives on every wheel double pace , and the wheel of fortune along with 'em , as our Mr. Stephen Guest said at the anniversary dinner -LRB- he hits these things off wonderfully , considering he 's seen nothing of business -RRB- . I do n't find fault with the change , as some people do . Trade , sir , opens a man 's eyes ; and if the population is to get thicker upon the ground , as it 's doing , the world must use its wits at inventions of one sort or other . I know I 've done my share as an ordinary man of business . Somebody has said it 's a fine thing to make two ears of corn grow where only one grew before ; but , sir , it 's a fine thing , too , to further the exchange of commodities , and bring the grains of corn to the mouths that are hungry .

We think that 'll be better , on all grounds , than raising your salary . It 'll give you more importance , and prepare you better for taking some of the anxiety off my shoulders by and by . I 'm equal to a good deal o ' work at present , thank God ; but I 'm getting older , -- there 's no denying that .

Both above and below , which way soever thou dost turn thee , everywhere thou shalt find the Cross ; and everywhere of necessity thou must have patience , if thou wilt have inward peace , and enjoy an everlasting crown ... If thou desirest to mount unto this height , thou must set out courageously , and lay the axe to the root , that thou mayest pluck up and destroy that hidden inordinate inclination to thyself , and unto all private and earthly good . On this sin , that a man inordinately loveth himself , almost all dependeth , whatsoever is thoroughly to be overcome ; which evil being once overcome and subdued , there will presently ensue great peace and tranquillity ... It is but little thou sufferest in comparison of them that have suffered so much , were so strongly tempted , so grievously afflicted , so many ways tried and exercised . Thou oughtest therefore to call to mind the more heavy sufferings of others , that thou mayest the easier bear thy little adversities . And if they seem not little unto thee , beware lest thy impatience be the cause thereof ...

And if he should do great penances , yet are they but little . And if he should attain to all knowledge , he is yet far off . And if he should be of great virtue , and very fervent devotion , yet is there much wanting ; to wit , one thing , which is most necessary for him . What is that ? That having left all , he leave himself , and go wholly out of himself , and retain nothing of self-love ...

Ours is a fine business , -- a splendid concern , sir , -- and there 's no reason why it should n't go on growing ; there 's a growing capital , and growing outlets for it ; but there 's another thing that 's wanted for the prosperity of every concern , large or small , and that 's men to conduct it , -- men of the right habits ; none o ' your flashy fellows , but such as are to be depended on . Now this is what Mr. Guest and I see clear enough . Three years ago we took Gell into the concern ; we gave him a share in the oil-mill . And why ?

And if it should ever suit your views to buy it for the firm , I should have a better chance of fulfilling my father 's wish . I should n't have liked to mention the thing to you , only you 've been kind enough to say my services have been of some value .
