Had he ever been in the way of learning , I think he would have drawn very well .

The excellence of his understanding and his principles can be concealed only by that shyness which too often keeps him silent . You know enough of him to do justice to his solid worth . But of his minuter propensities , as you call them you have from peculiar circumstances been kept more ignorant than myself . He and I have been at times thrown a good deal together , while you have been wholly engrossed on the most affectionate principle by my mother . I have seen a great deal of him , have studied his sentiments and heard his opinion on subjects of literature and taste ; and , upon the whole , I venture to pronounce that his mind is well-informed , enjoyment of books exceedingly great , his imagination lively , his observation just and correct , and his taste delicate and pure . His abilities in every respect improve as much upon acquaintance as his manners and person . At first sight , his address is certainly not striking ; and his person can hardly be called handsome , till the expression of his eyes , which are uncommonly good , and the general sweetness of his countenance , is perceived . At present , I know him so well , that I think him really handsome ; or at least , almost so . What say you , Marianne ?

But farther than this you must not believe . I am by no means assured of his regard for me . There are moments when the extent of it seems doubtful ; and till his sentiments are fully known , you can not wonder at my wishing to avoid any encouragement of my own partiality , by believing or calling it more than it is . In my heart I feel little -- scarcely any doubt of his preference . But there are other points to be considered besides his inclination . He is very far from being independent . What his mother really is we can not know ; but , from Fanny 's occasional mention of her conduct and opinions , we have never been disposed to think her amiable ; and I am very much mistaken if Edward is not himself aware that there would be many difficulties in his way , if he were to wish to marry a woman who had not either a great fortune or high rank .

Knowing all this , as I have now known it many weeks , guess what I must have felt on seeing your sister as fond of him as ever , and on being assured that she was to marry him : guess what I must have felt for all your sakes . When I came to you last week and found you alone , I came determined to know the truth ; though irresolute what to do when it WAS known . My behaviour must have seemed strange to you then ; but now you will comprehend it . To suffer you all to be so deceived ; to see your sister -- but what could I do ? I had no hope of interfering with success ; and sometimes I thought your sister 's influence might yet reclaim him . But now , after such dishonorable usage , who can tell what were his designs on her . Whatever they may have been , however , she may now , and hereafter doubtless WILL turn with gratitude towards her own condition , when she compares it with that of my poor Eliza , when she considers the wretched and hopeless situation of this poor girl , and pictures her to herself , with an affection for him so strong , still as strong as her own , and with a mind tormented by self-reproach , which must attend her through life . Surely this comparison must have its use with her . She will feel her own sufferings to be nothing . They proceed from no misconduct , and can bring no disgrace . On the contrary , every friend must be made still more her friend by them . Concern for her unhappiness , and respect for her fortitude under it , must strengthen every attachment . Use your own discretion , however , in communicating to her what I have told you . You must know best what will be its effect ; but had I not seriously , and from my heart believed it might be of service , might lessen her regrets , I would not have suffered myself to trouble you with this account of my family afflictions , with a recital which may seem to have been intended to raise myself at the expense of others . '' ","i":76009},{"w":"`` I have been more pained , '' ","i":76452},{"w":"`` by her endeavors to acquit him than by all the rest ; for it irritates her mind more than the most perfect conviction of his unworthiness can do .

'' ","i":76524},{"w":"`` I could meet him no other way . Eliza had confessed to me , though most reluctantly , the name of her lover ; and when he returned to town , which was within a fortnight after myself , we met by appointment , he to defend , I to punish his conduct .

Edward brought us a most charming account of the place : the most complete thing of its kind , he said , that ever was , and you all seemed to enjoy it beyond any thing . It was a great satisfaction to us to hear it , I assure you .

I remember Fanny used to say that she would marry sooner and better than you did ; not but what she is exceedingly fond of YOU , but so it happened to strike her . She will be mistaken , however . I question whether Marianne NOW , will marry a man worth more than five or six hundred a-year , at the utmost , and I am very much deceived if YOU do not do better . Dorsetshire !

To know that Marianne was in town was -- in the same language -- a thunderbolt . -- Thunderbolts and daggers ! -- what a reproof would she have given me ! -- her taste , her opinions -- I believe they are better known to me than my own , -- and I am sure they are dearer .

Now , however , his good-natured , honest , stupid soul , full of indignation against me , and concern for your sister , could not resist the temptation of telling me what he knew ought to -- though probably he did not think it WOULD -- vex me horridly . As bluntly as he could speak it , therefore , he told me that Marianne Dashwood was dying of a putrid fever at Cleveland -- a letter that morning received from Mrs. Jennings declared her danger most imminent -- the Palmers are all gone off in a fright , & c. -- I was too much shocked to be able to pass myself off as insensible even to the undiscerning Sir John . His heart was softened in seeing mine suffer ; and so much of his ill-will was done away , that when we parted , he almost shook me by the hand while he reminded me of an old promise about a pointer puppy . What I felt on hearing that your sister was dying -- and dying too , believing me the greatest villain upon earth , scorning , hating me in her latest moments -- for how could I tell what horrid projects might not have been imputed ? ONE person I was sure would represent me as capable of any thing -- What I felt was dreadful ! -- My resolution was soon made , and at eight o'clock this morning I was in my carriage .

It came out quite unawares , quite undesignedly . I , you may well believe , could talk of nothing but my child ; -- he could not conceal his distress ; I saw that it equalled my own , and he perhaps , thinking that mere friendship , as the world now goes , would not justify so warm a sympathy -- or rather , not thinking at all , I suppose -- giving way to irresistible feelings , made me acquainted with his earnest , tender , constant , affection for Marianne .

To Mrs. Jennings , to the Middletons , he has been long and intimately known ; they equally love and respect him ; and even my own knowledge of him , though lately acquired , is very considerable ; and so highly do I value and esteem him , that if Marianne can be happy with him , I shall be as ready as yourself to think our connection the greatest blessing to us in the world . What answer did you give him ? -- Did you allow him to hope ? '' ","i":125234},{"w":"`` No . -- He thinks Marianne 's affection too deeply rooted for any change in it under a great length of time , and even supposing her heart again free , is too diffident of himself to believe , that with such a difference of age and disposition he could ever attach her . There , however , he is quite mistaken . His age is only so much beyond hers as to be an advantage , as to make his character and principles fixed ; -- and his disposition , I am well convinced , is exactly the very one to make your sister happy . And his person , his manners too , are all in his favour . My partiality does not blind me ; he certainly is not so handsome as Willoughby -- but at the same time , there is something much more pleasing in his countenance . -- There was always a something , -- if you remember , -- in Willoughby 's eyes at times , which I did not like .

Had you married , you must have been always poor . His expensiveness is acknowledged even by himself , and his whole conduct declares that self-denial is a word hardly understood by him . His demands and your inexperience together , on a small , very small income , must have brought on distresses which would not be the LESS grievous to you , from having been entirely unknown and unthought of before . YOUR sense of honour and honesty would have led you , I know , when aware of your situation , to attempt all the economy that would appear to you possible : and , perhaps , as long as your frugality retrenched only on your own comfort , you might have been suffered to practice it , but beyond that -- and how little could the utmost of your single management do to stop the ruin which had begun before your marriage ? -- Beyond THAT , had you endeavoured , however reasonably , to abridge HIS enjoyments , is it not to be feared , that instead of prevailing on feelings so selfish to consent to it , you would have lessened your own influence on his heart , and made him regret the connection which had involved him in such difficulties ?

And why does he regret it ? -- Because he finds it has not answered towards himself . It has not made him happy . His circumstances are now unembarrassed -- he suffers from no evil of that kind ; and he thinks only that he has married a woman of a less amiable temper than yourself . But does it follow that had he married you , he would have been happy ? -- The inconveniences would have been different . He would then have suffered under the pecuniary distresses which , because they are removed , he now reckons as nothing . He would have had a wife of whose temper he could make no complaint , but he would have been always necessitous -- always poor ; and probably would soon have learned to rank the innumerable comforts of a clear estate and good income as of far more importance , even to domestic happiness , than the mere temper of a wife . '' ","i":130485},{"w":"`` One observation may , I think , be fairly drawn from the whole of the story -- that all Willoughby 's difficulties have arisen from the first offence against virtue , in his behaviour to Eliza Williams .

When I first became intimate in your family , I had no other intention , no other view in the acquaintance than to pass my time pleasantly while I was obliged to remain in Devonshire , more pleasantly than I had ever done before . Your sister 's lovely person and interesting manners could not but please me ; and her behaviour to me almost from the first , was of a kind -- It is astonishing , when I reflect on what it was , and what SHE was , that my heart should have been so insensible ! But at first I must confess , my vanity only was elevated by it . Careless of her happiness , thinking only of my own amusement , giving way to feelings which I had always been too much in the habit of indulging , I endeavoured , by every means in my power , to make myself pleasing to her , without any design of returning her affection . '' ","i":117862},{"w":"`` It is hardly worth while , Mr. Willoughby , for you to relate , or for me to listen any longer .

'' ","i":118106},{"w":"`` I insist on you hearing the whole of it , '' ","i":118159},{"w":"`` My fortune was never large , and I had always been expensive , always in the habit of associating with people of better income than myself . Every year since my coming of age , or even before , I believe , had added to my debts ; and though the death of my old cousin , Mrs. Smith , was to set me free ; yet that event being uncertain , and possibly far distant , it had been for some time my intention to re-establish my circumstances by marrying a woman of fortune . To attach myself to your sister , therefore , was not a thing to be thought of ; -- and with a meanness , selfishness , cruelty -- which no indignant , no contemptuous look , even of yours , Miss Dashwood , can ever reprobate too much -- I was acting in this manner , trying to engage her regard , without a thought of returning it . -- But one thing may be said for me : even in that horrid state of selfish vanity , I did not know the extent of the injury I meditated , because I did not THEN know what it was to love . But have I ever known it ? -- Well may it be doubted ; for , had I really loved , could I have sacrificed my feelings to vanity , to avarice ? -- or , what is more , could I have sacrificed hers ? -- But I have done it . To avoid a comparative poverty , which her affection and her society would have deprived of all its horrors , I have , by raising myself to affluence , lost every thing that could make it a blessing . '' ","i":118174},{"w":"`` To have resisted such attractions , to have withstood such tenderness ! -- Is there a man on earth who could have done it ? -- Yes , I found myself , by insensible degrees , sincerely fond of her ; and the happiest hours of my life were what I spent with her when I felt my intentions were strictly honourable , and my feelings blameless . Even THEN , however , when fully determined on paying my addresses to her , I allowed myself most improperly to put off , from day to day , the moment of doing it , from an unwillingness to enter into an engagement while my circumstances were so greatly embarrassed . I will not reason here -- nor will I stop for YOU to expatiate on the absurdity , and the worse than absurdity , of scrupling to engage my faith where my honour was already bound . The event has proved , that I was a cunning fool , providing with great circumspection for a possible opportunity of making myself contemptible and wretched for ever . At last , however , my resolution was taken , and I had determined , as soon as I could engage her alone , to justify the attentions I had so invariably paid her , and openly assure her of an affection which I had already taken such pains to display . But in the interim -- in the interim of the very few hours that were to pass , before I could have an opportunity of speaking with her in private -- a circumstance occurred -- an unlucky circumstance , to ruin all my resolution , and with it all my comfort . A discovery took place , '' ","i":118500},{"w":"`` Mrs. Smith had somehow or other been informed , I imagine by some distant relation , whose interest it was to deprive me of her favour , of an affair , a connection -- but I need not explain myself farther , '' ","i":118805},{"w":"`` your particular intimacy -- you have probably heard the whole story long ago .

I acknowledge that her situation and her character ought to have been respected by me . I do not mean to justify myself , but at the same time can not leave you to suppose that I have nothing to urge -- that because she was injured she was irreproachable , and because I was a libertine , SHE must be a saint . If the violence of her passions , the weakness of her understanding -- I do not mean , however , to defend myself . Her affection for me deserved better treatment , and I often , with great self-reproach , recall the tenderness which , for a very short time , had the power of creating any return . I wish -- I heartily wish it had never been . But I have injured more than herself ; and I have injured one , whose affection for me -- -LRB- may I say it ? -RRB- was scarcely less warm than hers ; and whose mind -- Oh ! how infinitely superior !

Miss Dashwood , you can not have an idea of the comfort it gives me to look back on my own misery . I owe such a grudge to myself for the stupid , rascally folly of my own heart , that all my past sufferings under it are only triumph and exultation to me now . Well , I went , left all that I loved , and went to those to whom , at best , I was only indifferent .

It is very right that you SHOULD go to town ; I would have every young woman of your condition in life acquainted with the manners and amusements of London . You will be under the care of a motherly good sort of woman , of whose kindness to you I can have no doubt .

The composure of mind with which I have brought myself at present to consider the matter , the consolation that I have been willing to admit , have been the effect of constant and painful exertion ; -- they did not spring up of themselves ; -- they did not occur to relieve my spirits at first . -- No , Marianne . -- THEN , if I had not been bound to silence , perhaps nothing could have kept me entirely -- not even what I owed to my dearest friends -- from openly shewing that I was VERY unhappy .
