On what foundation , moral or divine , traditional or legal , is grounded the warden 's claim to the large income he receives for doing nothing ? The contentment of these almsmen , if content they be , can give him no title to this wealth ! Does he ever ask himself , when he stretches wide his clerical palm to receive the pay of some dozen of the working clergy , for what service he is so remunerated ? Does his conscience ever entertain the question of his right to such subsidies ? Or is it possible that the subject never so presents itself to his mind ; that he has received for many years , and intends , should God spare him , to receive for years to come these fruits of the industrious piety of past ages , indifferent as to any right on his own part , or of any injustice to others !
