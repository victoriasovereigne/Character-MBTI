I worked it out in my mind while I was talking to her at supper . When I went upstairs to bed , our house being small and this young woman 's ears sharp , I stuffed the sheet into Mrs. Bucket 's mouth that she should n't say a word of surprise and told her all about it . My dear , do n't you give your mind to that again , or I shall link your feet together at the ankles . '' ","i":362184},{"w":"`` Sir Leicester Dedlock , Baronet , '' ","i":363291},{"w":"`` the last point in the case which I am now going to mention shows the necessity of patience in our business , and never doing a thing in a hurry . I watched this young woman yesterday without her knowledge when she was looking at the funeral , in company with my wife , who planned to take her there ; and I had so much to convict her , and I saw such an expression in her face , and my mind so rose against her malice towards her ladyship , and the time was altogether such a time for bringing down what you may call retribution upon her , that if I had been a younger hand with less experience , I should have taken her , certain . Equally , last night , when her ladyship , as is so universally admired I am sure , come home looking -- why , Lord , a man might almost say like Venus rising from the ocean -- it was so unpleasant and inconsistent to think of her being charged with a murder of which she was innocent that I felt quite to want to put an end to the job . What should I have lost ? Sir Leicester Dedlock , Baronet , I should have lost the weapon . My prisoner here proposed to Mrs. Bucket , after the departure of the funeral , that they should go per bus a little ways into the country and take tea at a very decent house of entertainment . Now , near that house of entertainment there 's a piece of water . At tea , my prisoner got up to fetch her pocket handkercher from the bedroom where the bonnets was ; she was rather a long time gone and came back a little out of wind . As soon as they came home this was reported to me by Mrs. Bucket , along with her observations and suspicions . I had the piece of water dragged by moonlight , in presence of a couple of our men , and the pocket pistol was brought up before it had been there half-a-dozen hours . Now , my dear , put your arm a little further through mine , and hold it steady , and I sha n't hurt you ! '' ","i":363323},{"w":"`` Sir Leicester Dedlock , Baronet , I understand you .

Eight or ten hours , worth , as I tell you , a hundred pound apiece at least , have been lost since Lady Dedlock disappeared . I am charged to find her . I am Inspector Bucket . Besides all the rest that 's heavy on her , she has upon her , as she believes , suspicion of murder . If I follow her alone , she , being in ignorance of what Sir Leicester Dedlock , Baronet , has communicated to me , may be driven to desperation . But if I follow her in company with a young lady , answering to the description of a young lady that she has a tenderness for -- I ask no question , and I say no more than that -- she will give me credit for being friendly . Let me come up with her and be able to have the hold upon her of putting that young lady for ` ard , and I 'll save her and prevail with her if she is alive . Let me come up with her alone -- a hard matter -- and I 'll do my best , but I do n't answer for what the best may be . Time flies ; it 's getting on for one o'clock .

I and some of my relations said that he had had a part of it already in board and lodging and some other things . Now mind ! That was the question , and nothing else . No one disputed the will ; no one disputed anything but whether part of that three hundred pounds had been already paid or not . To settle that question , my brother filing a bill , I was obliged to go into this accursed Chancery ; I was forced there because the law forced me and would let me go nowhere else . Seventeen people were made defendants to that simple suit ! It first came on after two years . It was then stopped for another two years while the master -LRB- may his head rot off ! -RRB- inquired whether I was my father 's son , about which there was no dispute at all with any mortal creature . He then found out that there were not defendants enough -- remember , there were only seventeen as yet ! -- but that we must have another who had been left out and must begin all over again . The costs at that time -- before the thing was begun ! -- were three times the legacy . My brother would have given up the legacy , and joyful , to escape more costs . My whole estate , left to me in that will of my father 's , has gone in costs . The suit , still undecided , has fallen into rack , and ruin , and despair , with everything else -- and here I stand , this day !

This has brought me into communication with Krook and into a knowledge of his house and his habits . I know he has a room to let .

And Miss Summerson 's wishes being to me a law -LRB- except as connected with circumstances over which I have no control -RRB- , I consequently never expected to have the distinguished honour of waiting on your ladyship again . '' ","i":370419},{"w":"`` And yet I am here now , '' ","i":370547},{"w":"`` My object being to communicate to your ladyship , under the seal of confidence , why I am here .

I have no interested views of my own to serve in coming here . If it was not for my promise to Miss Summerson and my keeping of it sacred -- I , in point of fact , should n't have darkened these doors again , but should have seen 'em further first . '' ","i":370615},{"w":"`` Indeed , it has been made so hard , '' ","i":370847},{"w":"`` to have any idea what that party was up to in combination with others that until the loss which we all deplore I was gravelled -- an expression which your ladyship , moving in the higher circles , will be so good as to consider tantamount to knocked over . Small likewise -- a name by which I refer to another party , a friend of mine that your ladyship is not acquainted with -- got to be so close and double-faced that at times it was n't easy to keep one 's hands off his ` ead . However , what with the exertion of my humble abilities , and what with the help of a mutual friend by the name of Mr. Tony Weevle -LRB- who is of a high aristocratic turn and has your ladyship 's portrait always hanging up in his room -RRB- , I have now reasons for an apprehension as to which I come to put your ladyship upon your guard . First , will your ladyship allow me to ask you whether you have had any strange visitors this morning ? I do n't mean fashionable visitors , but such visitors , for instance , as Miss Barbary 's old servant , or as a person without the use of his lower extremities , carried upstairs similarly to a guy ? '' ","i":370862},{"w":"`` Your ladyship , I come to put you on your guard . There may be no occasion for it . Very well . Then I have only done my best to keep my promise to Miss Summerson . I strongly suspect -LRB- from what Small has dropped , and from what we have corkscrewed out of him -RRB- that those letters I was to have brought to your ladyship were not destroyed when I supposed they were . That if there was anything to be blown upon , it IS blown upon . That the visitors I have alluded to have been here this morning to make money of it . And that the money is made , or making .
