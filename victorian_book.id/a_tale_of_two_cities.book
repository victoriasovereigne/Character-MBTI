There is no harm at all done . I have not proposed to the young lady , and , between ourselves , I am by no means certain , on reflection , that I ever should have committed myself to that extent . Mr. Lorry , you can not control the mincing vanities and giddinesses of empty-headed girls ; you must not expect to do it , or you will always be disappointed . Now , pray say no more about it .
