Yes , Harriet , just so long have I been wanting the very circumstance to happen that has happened . I could never tell whether an attachment between you and Mr. Elton were most desirable or most natural . Its probability and its eligibility have really so equalled each other ! I am very happy . I congratulate you , my dear Harriet , with all my heart . This is an attachment which a woman may well feel pride in creating . This is a connexion which offers nothing but good . It will give you every thing that you want -- consideration , independence , a proper home -- it will fix you in the centre of all your real friends , close to Hartfield and to me , and confirm our intimacy for ever . This , Harriet , is an alliance which can never raise a blush in either of us .

Well , -LRB- smiling , -RRB- I hope it may be allowed that if compassion has produced exertion and relief to the sufferers , it has done all that is truly important .

Very much grieved and concerned -- I had flattered myself that she must be better after such a cordial as I knew had been given her in the morning . '' ","i":44179},{"w":"`` My visit was of use to the nervous part of her complaint , I hope ; but not even I can charm away a sore throat ; it is a most severe cold indeed .

I used to think she was not capable of being fond of any body , except herself : but she has always been kind to him -LRB- in her way -- allowing for little whims and caprices , and expecting every thing to be as she likes -RRB- . And it is no small credit , in my opinion , to him , that he should excite such an affection ; for , though I would not say it to any body else , she has no more heart than a stone to people in general ; and the devil of a temper . '' ","i":46660},{"w":"`` And so you do not consider this visit from your son as by any means certain . I am sorry for it .

So far from having long understood you , I have been in a most complete error with respect to your views , till this moment . As to myself , I am very sorry that you should have been giving way to any feelings -- Nothing could be farther from my wishes -- your attachment to my friend Harriet -- your pursuit of her , -LRB- pursuit , it appeared , -RRB- gave me great pleasure , and I have been very earnestly wishing you success : but had I supposed that she were not your attraction to Hartfield , I should certainly have thought you judged ill in making your visits so frequent . Am I to believe that you have never sought to recommend yourself particularly to Miss Smith ? -- that you have never thought seriously of her ? '' ","i":51095},{"w":"`` Here have I , '' ","i":53114},{"w":"`` actually talked poor Harriet into being very much attached to this man . She might never have thought of him but for me ; and certainly never would have thought of him with hope , if I had not assured her of his attachment , for she is as modest and humble as I used to think him . Oh ! that I had been satisfied with persuading her not to accept young Martin . There I was quite right . That was well done of me ; but there I should have stopped , and left the rest to time and chance . I was introducing her into good company , and giving her the opportunity of pleasing some one worth having ; I ought not to have attempted more . But now , poor girl , her peace is cut up for some time . I have been but half a friend to her ; and if she were _ not _ to feel this disappointment so very much , I am sure I have not an idea of any body else who would be at all desirable for her ; -- William Coxe -- Oh ! no , I could not endure William Coxe -- a pert young lawyer . '' ","i":53123},{"w":"`` No , '' ","i":56615},{"w":"`` but perhaps there might be some made to his coming back again . Such language for a young man entirely dependent , to use ! -- Nobody but you , Mr. Knightley , would imagine it possible . But you have not an idea of what is requisite in situations directly opposite to your own . Mr. Frank Churchill to be making such a speech as that to the uncle and aunt , who have brought him up , and are to provide for him ! -- Standing up in the middle of the room , I suppose , and speaking as loud as he could ! -- How can you imagine such conduct practicable ? '' ","i":56624},{"w":"`` We shall never agree about him , '' ","i":57353},{"w":"`` but that is nothing extraordinary . I have not the least idea of his being a weak young man : I feel sure that he is not . Mr. Weston would not be blind to folly , though in his own son ; but he is very likely to have a more yielding , complying , mild disposition than would suit your notions of man 's perfection . I dare say he has ; and though it may cut him off from some advantages , it will secure him many others . '' ","i":57365},{"w":"`` I will say no more about him , '' ","i":58187},{"w":"`` you turn every thing to evil . We are both prejudiced ; you against , I for him ; and we have no chance of agreeing till he is really here . '' ","i":58200},{"w":"`` Mr. Elton is so good to the poor ! '' ","i":58498},{"w":"`` Have you heard from Miss Fairfax so lately ? I am extremely happy . I hope she is well ? '' ","i":59357},{"w":"`` So obliging of you ! No , we should not have heard , if it had not been for this particular circumstance , of her being to come here so soon . My mother is so delighted ! -- for she is to be three months with us at least . Three months , she says so , positively , as I am going to have the pleasure of reading to you . The case is , you see , that the Campbells are going to Ireland . Mrs. Dixon has persuaded her father and mother to come over and see her directly . They had not intended to go over till the summer , but she is so impatient to see them again -- for till she married , last October , she was never away from them so much as a week , which must make it very strange to be in different kingdoms , I was going to say , but however different countries , and so she wrote a very urgent letter to her mother -- or her father , I declare I do not know which it was , but we shall see presently in Jane 's letter -- wrote in Mr. Dixon 's name as well as her own , to press their coming over directly , and they would give them the meeting in Dublin , and take them back to their country seat , Baly-craig , a beautiful place , I fancy . Jane has heard a great deal of its beauty ; from Mr. Dixon , I mean -- I do not know that she ever heard about it from any body else ; but it was very natural , you know , that he should like to speak of his own place while he was paying his addresses -- and as Jane used to be very often walking out with them -- for Colonel and Mrs. Campbell were very particular about their daughter 's not walking out often with only Mr. Dixon , for which I do not at all blame them ; of course she heard every thing he might be telling Miss Campbell about his own home in Ireland ; and I think she wrote us word that he had shewn them some drawings of the place , views that he had taken himself . He is a most amiable , charming young man , I believe . Jane was quite longing to go to Ireland , from his account of things . '' ","i":60340},{"w":"`` I am afraid we must be running away , '' ","i":61858},{"w":"`` At a watering-place , or in a common London acquaintance , it was difficult to decide on such points . Manners were all that could be safely judged of , under a much longer knowledge than they had yet had of Mr. Churchill . She believed every body found his manners pleasing .

'' ","i":65452},{"w":"`` She is a sort of elegant creature that one can not keep one 's eyes from . I am always watching her to admire ; and I do pity her from my heart . '' ","i":65496},{"w":"`` Oh ! my dear sir , how are you this morning ? My dear Miss Woodhouse -- I come quite over-powered . Such a beautiful hind-quarter of pork ! You are too bountiful ! Have you heard the news ? Mr. Elton is going to be married . '' ","i":66006},{"w":"`` It was short -- merely to announce -- but cheerful , exulting , of course . '' ","i":66565},{"w":"`` Mr. Elton going to be married ! '' ","i":66647},{"w":"`` Who shall answer that question ? '' ","i":66844},{"w":"`` As to who , or what Miss Hawkins is , or how long he has been acquainted with her , '' ","i":67200},{"w":"`` nothing I suppose can be known . One feels that it can not be a very long acquaintance . He has been gone only four weeks . '' ","i":67225},{"w":"`` You are silent , Miss Fairfax -- but I hope you mean to take an interest in this news . You , who have been hearing and seeing so much of late on these subjects , who must have been so deep in the business on Miss Campbell 's account -- we shall not excuse your being indifferent about Mr. Elton and Miss Hawkins . '' ","i":67272},{"w":"`` Well , my dear Jane , I believe we must be running away . The weather does not look well , and grandmama will be uneasy . You are too obliging , my dear Miss Woodhouse ; but we really must take leave . This has been a most agreeable piece of news indeed . I shall just go round by Mrs. Cole 's ; but I shall not stop three minutes : and , Jane , you had better go home directly -- I would not have you out in a shower ! -- We think she is the better for Highbury already . Thank you , we do indeed . I shall not attempt calling on Mrs. Goddard , for I really do not think she cares for any thing but _ boiled _ pork : when we dress the leg it will be another thing . Good morning to you , my dear sir . Oh ! Mr. Knightley is coming too . Well , that is so very ! -- I am sure if Jane is tired , you will be so kind as to give her your arm . -- Mr. Elton , and Miss Hawkins ! -- Good morning to you . '' ","i":67751},{"w":"`` And so , there she had set , without an idea of any thing in the world , full ten minutes , perhaps -- when , all of a sudden , who should come in -- to be sure it was so very odd ! -- but they always dealt at Ford 's -- who should come in , but Elizabeth Martin and her brother ! -- Dear Miss Woodhouse ! only think . I thought I should have fainted . I did not know what to do . I was sitting near the door -- Elizabeth saw me directly ; but he did not ; he was busy with the umbrella . I am sure she saw me , but she looked away directly , and took no notice ; and they both went to quite the farther end of the shop ; and I kept sitting near the door ! -- Oh ! dear ; I was so miserable ! I am sure I must have been as white as my gown . I could not go away you know , because of the rain ; but I did so wish myself anywhere in the world but there . -- Oh ! dear , Miss Woodhouse -- well , at last , I fancy , he looked round and saw me ; for instead of going on with her buyings , they began whispering to one another . I am sure they were talking of me ; and I could not help thinking that he was persuading her to speak to me -- -LRB- do you think he was , Miss Woodhouse ? -RRB- -- for presently she came forward -- came quite up to me , and asked me how I did , and seemed ready to shake hands , if I would . She did not do any of it in the same way that she used ; I could see she was altered ; but , however , she seemed to _ try _ to be very friendly , and we shook hands , and stood talking some time ; but I know no more what I said -- I was in such a tremble ! -- I remember she said she was sorry we never met now ; which I thought almost too kind ! Dear , Miss Woodhouse , I was absolutely miserable ! By that time , it was beginning to hold up , and I was determined that nothing should stop me from getting away -- and then -- only think ! -- I found he was coming up towards me too -- slowly you know , and as if he did not quite know what to do ; and so he came and spoke , and I answered -- and I stood for a minute , feeling dreadfully , you know , one ca n't tell how ; and then I took courage , and said it did not rain , and I must go ; and so off I set ; and I had not got three yards from the door , when he came after me , only to say , if I was going to Hartfield , he thought I had much better go round by Mr. Cole 's stables , for I should find the near way quite floated by this rain . Oh ! dear , I thought it would have been the death of me ! So I said , I was very much obliged to him : you know I could not do less ; and then he went back to Elizabeth , and I came round by the stables -- I believe I did -- but I hardly knew where I was , or any thing about it . Oh ! Miss Woodhouse , I would rather done any thing than have it happen : and yet , you know , there was a sort of satisfaction in seeing him behave so pleasantly and so kindly . And Elizabeth , too . Oh ! Miss Woodhouse , do talk to me and make me comfortable again . '' ","i":68406},{"w":"`` This is too bad , '' ","i":72376},{"w":"`` And now we shall just miss them ; too provoking ! -- I do not know when I have been so disappointed .

If he were , he would have done this differently . He would either have gloried in the achievement , or been ashamed of it . There would have been either the ostentation of a coxcomb , or the evasions of a mind too weak to defend its own vanities . -- No , I am perfectly sure that he is not trifling or silly .

He is not a gallant man , but he is a very humane one ; and this , considering Jane Fairfax 's ill-health , would appear a case of humanity to him ; -- and for an act of unostentatious kindness , there is nobody whom I would fix on more than on Mr. Knightley .

At one time Patty came to say she thought the kitchen chimney wanted sweeping . Oh , said I , Patty do not come with your bad news to me . Here is the rivet of your mistress 's spectacles out . Then the baked apples came home , Mrs. Wallis sent them by her boy ; they are extremely civil and obliging to us , the Wallises , always -- I have heard some people say that Mrs. Wallis can be uncivil and give a very rude answer , but we have never known any thing but the greatest attention from them . And it can not be for the value of our custom now , for what is our consumption of bread , you know ? Only three of us . -- besides dear Jane at present -- and she really eats nothing -- makes such a shocking breakfast , you would be quite frightened if you saw it . I dare not let my mother know how little she eats -- so I say one thing and then I say another , and it passes off . But about the middle of the day she gets hungry , and there is nothing she likes so well as these baked apples , and they are extremely wholesome , for I took the opportunity the other day of asking Mr. Perry ; I happened to meet him in the street . Not that I had any doubt before -- I have so often heard Mr. Woodhouse recommend a baked apple . I believe it is the only way that Mr. Woodhouse thinks the fruit thoroughly wholesome . We have apple-dumplings , however , very often . Patty makes an excellent apple-dumpling . Well , Mrs. Weston , you have prevailed , I hope , and these ladies will oblige us .

These are the motives which I have been pressing on you . They are very important -- and sorry I am that you can not feel them sufficiently to act upon them .

And as to its recommendations to _ you _ , I fancy I need not take much pains to dwell on them . The advantages of Bath to the young are pretty generally understood . It would be a charming introduction for you , who have lived so secluded a life ; and I could immediately secure you some of the best society in the place .

Indeed I must say that , much as I had heard of him before and much as I had expected , he very far exceeds any thing ... I do congratulate you , Mrs. Weston , most warmly . He seems every thing the fondest parent could ... ` Oh ! ' said he , ` I can fasten the rivet . I like a job of that sort excessively . ' I never shall forget his manner . And when I brought out the baked apples from the closet , and hoped our friends would be so very obliging as to take some , ` Oh ! ' said he directly , ` there is nothing in the way of fruit half so good , and these are the finest-looking home-baked apples I ever saw in my life . ' That , you know , was so very ... And I am sure , by his manner , it was no compliment . Indeed they are very delightful apples , and Mrs. Wallis does them full justice -- only we do not have them baked more than twice , and Mr. Woodhouse made us promise to have them done three times -- but Miss Woodhouse will be so good as not to mention it . The apples themselves are the very finest sort for baking , beyond a doubt ; all from Donwell -- some of Mr. Knightley 's most liberal supply . He sends us a sack every year ; and certainly there never was such a keeping apple anywhere as one of his trees -- I believe there is two of them . My mother says the orchard was always famous in her younger days . But I was really quite shocked the other day -- for Mr. Knightley called one morning , and Jane was eating these apples , and we talked about them and said how much she enjoyed them , and he asked whether we were not got to the end of our stock . ` I am sure you must be , ' said he , ` and I will send you another supply ; for I have a great many more than I can ever use . William Larkins let me keep a larger quantity than usual this year . I will send you some more , before they get good for nothing . ' So I begged he would not -- for really as to ours being gone , I could not absolutely say that we had a great many left -- it was but half a dozen indeed ; but they should be all kept for Jane ; and I could not at all bear that he should be sending us more , so liberal as he had been already ; and Jane said the same . And when he was gone , she almost quarrelled with me -- No , I should not say quarrelled , for we never had a quarrel in our lives ; but she was quite distressed that I had owned the apples were so nearly gone ; she wished I had made him believe we had a great many left . Oh , said I , my dear , I did say as much as I could . However , the very same evening William Larkins came over with a large basket of apples , the same sort of apples , a bushel at least , and I was very much obliged , and went down and spoke to William Larkins and said every thing , as you may suppose . William Larkins is such an old acquaintance ! I am always glad to see him . But , however , I found afterwards from Patty , that William said it was all the apples of _ that _ sort his master had ; he had brought them all -- and now his master had not one left to bake or boil . William did not seem to mind it himself , he was so pleased to think his master had sold so many ; for William , you know , thinks more of his master 's profit than any thing ; but Mrs. Hodges , he said , was quite displeased at their being all sent away . She could not bear that her master should not be able to have another apple-tart this spring . He told Patty this , but bid her not mind it , and be sure not to say any thing to us about it , for Mrs. Hodges _ would _ be cross sometimes , and as long as so many sacks were sold , it did not signify who ate the remainder . And so Patty told me , and I was excessively shocked indeed ! I would not have Mr. Knightley know any thing about it for the world ! He would be so very ... I wanted to keep it from Jane 's knowledge ; but , unluckily , I had mentioned it before I was aware . '' ","i":92608},{"w":"`` I do not see much sign of it .

Mrs. Perry was very anxious that he should have a carriage , and came to my mother in great spirits one morning because she thought she had prevailed . Jane , do n't you remember grandmama 's telling us of it when we got home ? I forget where we had been walking to -- very likely to Randalls ; yes , I think it was to Randalls . Mrs. Perry was always particularly fond of my mother -- indeed I do not know who is not -- and she had mentioned it to her in confidence ; she had no objection to her telling us , of course , but it was not to go beyond : and , from that day to this , I never mentioned it to a soul that I know of . At the same time , I will not positively answer for my having never dropt a hint , because I know I do sometimes pop out a thing before I am aware . I am a talker , you know ; I am rather a talker ; and now and then I have let a thing escape me which I should not . I am not like Jane ; I wish I were .

It was before tea -- stay -- no , it could not be before tea , because we were just going to cards -- and yet it was before tea , because I remember thinking -- Oh ! no , now I recollect , now I have it ; something happened before tea , but not that . Mr. Elton was called out of the room before tea , old John Abdy 's son wanted to speak with him . Poor old John , I have a great regard for him ; he was clerk to my poor father twenty-seven years ; and now , poor old man , he is bed-ridden , and very poorly with the rheumatic gout in his joints -- I must go and see him to-day ; and so will Jane , I am sure , if she gets out at all .

Her friends evidently thought this good enough for her ; and it _ was _ good enough . She desired nothing better herself . Till you chose to turn her into a friend , her mind had no distaste for her own set , nor any ambition beyond it . She was as happy as possible with the Martins in the summer .

Robert Martin would never have proceeded so far , if he had not felt persuaded of her not being disinclined to him . I know him well .

Vanity working on a weak head , produces every sort of mischief . Nothing so easy as for a young lady to raise her expectations too high . Miss Harriet Smith may not find offers of marriage flow in so fast , though she is a very pretty girl . Men of sense , whatever you may chuse to say , do not want silly wives . Men of family would not be very fond of connecting themselves with a girl of such obscurity -- and most prudent men would be afraid of the inconvenience and disgrace they might be involved in , when the mystery of her parentage came to be revealed . Let her marry Robert Martin , and she is safe , respectable , and happy for ever ; but if you encourage her to expect to marry greatly , and teach her to be satisfied with nothing less than a man of consequence and large fortune , she may be a parlour-boarder at Mrs. Goddard 's all the rest of her life -- or , at least , -LRB- for Harriet Smith is a girl who will marry somebody or other , -RRB- till she grow desperate , and is glad to catch at the old writing-master 's son .
