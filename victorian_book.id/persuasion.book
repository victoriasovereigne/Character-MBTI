Four-and-twenty hours later , and I should only have been a gallant Captain Wentworth , in a small paragraph at one corner of the newspapers ; and being lost in only a sloop , nobody would have thought about me . '' ","i":24264},{"w":"`` Oh ! Frederick ! But I can not believe it of you . -- All idle refinement ! -- Women may be as comfortable on board , as in the best house in England . I believe I have lived as much on board as most women , and I know nothing superior to the accommodations of a man-of-war . I declare I have not a comfort or an indulgence about me , even at Kellynch Hall , '' ","i":25689},{"w":"`` beyond what I always had in most of the ships I have lived in ; and they have been five altogether .

I could not bear that she should be frightened from the visit by such nonsense . What ! would I be turned back from doing a thing that I had determined to do , and that I knew to be right , by the airs and interference of such a person , or of any person I may say ? No , I have no idea of being so easily persuaded . When I have made up my mind , I have made it ; and Henrietta seemed entirely to have made up hers to call at Winthrop to-day ; and yet , she was as near giving it up , out of nonsensical complaisance ! '' ","i":32693},{"w":"`` I do not exactly know , for Henrietta and I were at school at the time ; but I believe about a year before he married Mary . I wish she had accepted him . We should all have liked her a great deal better ; and papa and mamma always think it was her great friend Lady Russell 's doing , that she did not . They think Charles might not be learned and bookish enough to please Lady Russell , and that therefore , she persuaded Anne to refuse him . '' ","i":33403},{"w":"`` Do let us have the pleasure of taking you home . Here is excellent room for three , I assure you . If we were all like you , I believe we might sit four . You must , indeed , you must .

'' ","i":40943},{"w":"`` The Laconia had come into Plymouth the week before ; no danger of her being sent to sea again . He stood his chance for the rest ; wrote up for leave of absence , but without waiting the return , travelled night and day till he got to Portsmouth , rowed off to the Grappler that instant , and never left the poor fellow for a week . That 's what he did , and nobody else could have saved poor James . You may think , Miss Elliot , whether he is dear to us ! '' ","i":41120},{"w":"`` Go to him , go to him , '' ","i":41880},{"w":"`` for heaven 's sake go to him . I can support her myself . Leave me , and go to him . Rub her hands , rub her temples ; here are salts ; take them , take them . '' ","i":41893},{"w":"`` A surgeon ! '' ","i":42011},{"w":"`` Captain Benwick , would not it be better for Captain Benwick ? He knows where a surgeon is to be found . '' ","i":42056},{"w":"`` Oh God ! that I had not given way to her at the fatal moment ! Had I done as I ought ! But so eager and so resolute ! Dear , sweet Louisa ! '' ","i":44601},{"w":"`` What should they do without her ? They were wretched comforters for one another . '' ","i":45579},{"w":"`` I think you are very likely to suffer the most of the two ; your feelings are less reconciled to the change than mine . By remaining in the neighbourhood , I am become inured to it . '' ","i":46812},{"w":"`` These rooms ought to belong only to us . Oh , how fallen in their destination ! How unworthily occupied ! An ancient family to be so driven away ! Strangers filling their place ! '' ","i":47000},{"w":"`` you will not think it a good place , for yours were always kept in the butler 's room . Ay , so it always is , I believe . One man 's ways may be as good as another 's , but we all like our own best . And so you must judge for yourself , whether it would be better for you to go about the house or not . '' ","i":47574},{"w":"`` I should think he must be rather a dressy man for his time of life . Such a number of looking-glasses ! oh Lord ! there was no getting away from one 's self . So I got Sophy to lend me a hand , and we soon shifted their quarters ; and now I am quite snug , with my little shaving glass in one corner , and another great thing that I never go near . '' ","i":47843},{"w":"`` There we differ , Mary , '' ","i":49594},{"w":"`` Oh ! when shall I leave you again ? '' ","i":51255},{"w":"`` If I thought it would not tempt her to go out in sharp winds , and grow coarse , I would send her a new hat and pelisse .

'' ","i":57047},{"w":"`` I can easily believe it . Women of that class have great opportunities , and if they are intelligent may be well worth listening to . Such varieties of human nature as they are in the habit of witnessing ! And it is not merely in its follies , that they are well read ; for they see it occasionally under every circumstance that can be most interesting or affecting . What instances must pass before them of ardent , disinterested , self-denying attachment , of heroism , fortitude , patience , resignation : of all the conflicts and all the sacrifices that ennoble us most . A sick chamber may often furnish the worth of volumes . '' ","i":58874},{"w":"`` there are so many who forget to think seriously till it is almost too late .

'' ","i":60490},{"w":"`` Lady Elliot '' ","i":60812},{"w":"`` Oh ! those letters are convenient passports . They secure an introduction . I should have visited Admiral Croft , however , at any rate . I know what is due to my tenant . '' ","i":61538},{"w":"'' Brigden stares to see anybody with me but my wife . She , poor soul , is tied by the leg . She has a blister on one of her heels , as large as a three-shilling piece . If you look across the street , you will see Admiral Brand coming down and his brother . Shabby fellows , both of them ! I am glad they are not on this side of the way . Sophy can not bear them . They played me a pitiful trick once : got away with some of my best men . I will tell you the whole story another time . There comes old Sir Archibald Drew and his grandson . Look , he sees us ; he kisses his hand to you ; he takes you for my wife . Ah ! the peace has come too soon for that younker . Poor old Sir Archibald ! How do you like Bath , Miss Elliot ? It suits us very well . We are always meeting with some old friend or other ; the streets full of them every morning ; sure to have plenty of chat ; and then we get away from them all , and shut ourselves in our lodgings , and draw in our chairs , and are as snug as if we were at Kellynch , ay , or as we used to be even at North Yarmouth and Deal . We do not like our lodgings here the worse , I can tell you , for putting us in mind of those we first had at North Yarmouth . The wind blows through one of the cupboards just in the same way . '' ","i":64596},{"w":"`` Louisa . '' ","i":65080},{"w":"`` I thought Captain Benwick a very pleasing young man , '' ","i":65353},{"w":"`` and I understand that he bears an excellent character . '' ","i":65368},{"w":"`` Well , well , ladies are the best judges ; but James Benwick is rather too piano for me ; and though very likely it is all our partiality , Sophy and I can not help thinking Frederick 's manners better than his . There is something about Frederick more to our taste . '' ","i":65516},{"w":"`` I was not entering into any comparison of the two friends , '' ","i":65627},{"w":"`` And the thing is certainly true . It is not a mere bit of gossip . We have it from Frederick himself . His sister had a letter from him yesterday , in which he tells us of it , and he had just had it in a letter from Harville , written upon the spot , from Uppercross . I fancy they are all at Uppercross . '' ","i":65648},{"w":"`` I hope , Admiral , I hope there is nothing in the style of Captain Wentworth 's letter to make you and Mrs Croft particularly uneasy . It did seem , last autumn , as if there were an attachment between him and Louisa Musgrove ; but I hope it may be understood to have worn out on each side equally , and without violence . I hope his letter does not breathe the spirit of an ill-used man . '' ","i":65733},{"w":"`` Not at all , not at all ; there is not an oath or a murmur from beginning to end . '' ","i":65815},{"w":"`` Good morning to you ! '' ","i":67702},{"w":"`` And so do I. No comparison . But the men are all wild after Miss Elliot . Anne is too delicate for them . '' ","i":67877},{"w":"`` You were a good while at Lyme , I think ? '' ","i":70063},{"w":"`` I should very much like to see Lyme again , '' ","i":70162},{"w":"`` The last hours were certainly very painful , '' ","i":70234},{"w":"`` but when pain is over , the remembrance of it often becomes a pleasure . One does not love a place the less for having suffered in it , unless it has been all suffering , nothing but suffering , which was by no means the case at Lyme . We were only in anxiety and distress during the last two hours , and previously there had been a great deal of enjoyment . So much novelty and beauty ! I have travelled so little , that every fresh place would be interesting to me ; but there is real beauty at Lyme ; and in short '' ","i":70247},{"w":"`` altogether my impressions of the place are very agreeable . '' ","i":70366},{"w":"`` This , '' ","i":71359},{"w":"`` is nearly the sense , or rather the meaning of the words , for certainly the sense of an Italian love-song must not be talked of , but it is as nearly the meaning as I can give ; for I do not pretend to understand the language . I am a very poor Italian scholar . '' ","i":71366},{"w":"`` No , no , some time or other , perhaps , but not now . He would mention no names now ; but such , he could assure her , had been the fact . He had many years ago received such a description of Miss Anne Elliot as had inspired him with the highest idea of her merit , and excited the warmest curiosity to know her . '' ","i":71796},{"w":"`` Is not this song worth staying for ? '' ","i":73025},{"w":"`` But I ought to have looked about me more , '' ","i":73869},{"w":"`` No , no ; you were better employed . You need not tell me that you had a pleasant evening . I see it in your eye . I perfectly see how the hours passed : that you had always something agreeable to listen to . In the intervals of the concert it was conversation . '' ","i":73908},{"w":"`` Do you see that in my eye ? '' ","i":73972},{"w":"`` Yes , I do . Your countenance perfectly informs me that you were in company last night with the person whom you think the most agreeable in the world , the person who interests you at this present time more than all the rest of the world put together . '' ","i":73982},{"w":"`` Mr Elliot ! '' ","i":74180},{"w":"`` Are you acquainted with Mr Elliot ? '' ","i":74226},{"w":"`` I should be extremely happy ; I hope you can not doubt my willingness to be of even the slightest use to you , '' ","i":74391},{"w":"`` but I suspect that you are considering me as having a higher claim on Mr Elliot , a greater right to influence him , than is really the case . I am sure you have , somehow or other , imbibed such a notion . You must consider me only as Mr Elliot 's relation . If in that light there is anything which you suppose his cousin might fairly ask of him , I beg you would not hesitate to employ me . '' ","i":74420},{"w":"`` No , '' ","i":74604},{"w":"`` nor next week , nor next , nor next . I assure you that nothing of the sort you are thinking of will be settled any week . I am not going to marry Mr Elliot . I should like to know why you imagine I am ? '' ","i":74611},{"w":"`` No , '' ","i":75073},{"w":"`` I can readily believe all that of my cousin . He seems to have a calm decided temper , not at all open to dangerous impressions . I consider him with great respect . I have no reason , from any thing that has fallen within my observation , to do otherwise . But I have not known him long ; and he is not a man , I think , to be known intimately soon . Will not this manner of speaking of him , Mrs Smith , convince you that he is nothing to me ? Surely this must be calm enough . And , upon my word , he is nothing to me . Should he ever propose to me -LRB- which I have very little reason to imagine he has any thought of doing -RRB- , I shall not accept him . I assure you I shall not . I assure you , Mr Elliot had not the share which you have been supposing , in whatever pleasure the concert of last night might afford : not Mr Elliot ; it is not Mr Elliot that -- '' ","i":75080},{"w":"`` The whole history , '' ","i":75619},{"w":"`` But , '' ","i":75658},{"w":"`` though there is no truth in my having this claim on Mr Elliot , I should be extremely happy to be of use to you in any way that I could . Shall I mention to him your being in Bath ? Shall I take any message ? '' ","i":75667},{"w":"`` This must have been about that very period of Mr Elliot 's life , '' ","i":76520},{"w":"`` which has always excited my particular curiosity . It must have been about the same time that he became known to my father and sister . I never knew him myself ; I only heard of him ; but there was a something in his conduct then , with regard to my father and sister , and afterwards in the circumstances of his marriage , which I never could quite reconcile with present times . It seemed to announce a different sort of man . '' ","i":76539},{"w":"`` Nay , '' ","i":76797},{"w":"`` I have no particular enquiry to make about her . I have always understood they were not a happy couple . But I should like to know why , at that time of his life , he should slight my father 's acquaintance as he did . My father was certainly disposed to take very kind and proper notice of him . Why did Mr Elliot draw back ? '' ","i":76804},{"w":"`` Perhaps , '' ","i":77087},{"w":"`` you sometimes spoke of me to Mr Elliot ? '' ","i":77100},{"w":"`` To be sure I did ; very often . I used to boast of my own Anne Elliot , and vouch for your being a very different creature from -- '' ","i":77111},{"w":"`` This accounts for something which Mr Elliot said last night , '' ","i":77150},{"w":"`` Indeed , my dear Mrs Smith , I want none , '' ","i":77623},{"w":"`` But for my satisfaction , if you will have the goodness to ring for Mary ; stay : I am sure you will have the still greater goodness of going yourself into my bedroom , and bringing me the small inlaid box which you will find on the upper shelf of the closet . '' ","i":77688},{"w":"`` I wish I had any name but Elliot . I am sick of it . The name of Walter I can drop , thank God ! and I desire you will never insult me with my second W. again , meaning , for the rest of my life , to be only yours truly , -- Wm. Elliot . '' ","i":78147},{"w":"`` Thank you . This is full proof undoubtedly ; proof of every thing you were saying . But why be acquainted with us now ? '' ","i":78371},{"w":"`` This was the light in which it appeared to those who knew the family , long before you returned to it ; and Colonel Wallis had his eye upon your father enough to be sensible of it , though he did not then visit in Camden Place ; but his regard for Mr Elliot gave him an interest in watching all that was going on there , and when Mr Elliot came to Bath for a day or two , as he happened to do a little before Christmas , Colonel Wallis made him acquainted with the appearance of things , and the reports beginning to prevail . Now you are to understand , that time had worked a very material change in Mr Elliot 's opinions as to the value of a baronetcy . Upon all points of blood and connexion he is a completely altered man . Having long had as much money as he could spend , nothing to wish for on the side of avarice or indulgence , he has been gradually learning to pin his happiness upon the consequence he is heir to . I thought it coming on before our acquaintance ceased , but it is now a confirmed feeling . He can not bear the idea of not being Sir William . You may guess , therefore , that the news he heard from his friend could not be very agreeable , and you may guess what it produced ; the resolution of coming back to Bath as soon as possible , and of fixing himself here for a time , with the view of renewing his former acquaintance , and recovering such a footing in the family as might give him the means of ascertaining the degree of his danger , and of circumventing the lady if he found it material . This was agreed upon between the two friends as the only thing to be done ; and Colonel Wallis was to assist in every way that he could . He was to be introduced , and Mrs Wallis was to be introduced , and everybody was to be introduced . Mr Elliot came back accordingly ; and on application was forgiven , as you know , and re-admitted into the family ; and there it was his constant object , and his only object -LRB- till your arrival added another motive -RRB- , to watch Sir Walter and Mrs Clay . He omitted no opportunity of being with them , threw himself in their way , called at all hours ; but I need not be particular on this subject . You can imagine what an artful man would do ; and with this guide , perhaps , may recollect what you have seen him do . '' ","i":79241},{"w":"`` Yes , '' ","i":79710},{"w":"`` you tell me nothing which does not accord with what I have known , or could imagine . There is always something offensive in the details of cunning . The manoeuvres of selfishness and duplicity must ever be revolting , but I have heard nothing which really surprises me . I know those who would be shocked by such a representation of Mr Elliot , who would have difficulty in believing it ; but I have never been satisfied . I have always wanted some other motive for his conduct than appeared . I should like to know his present opinion , as to the probability of the event he has been in dread of ; whether he considers the danger to be lessening or not . '' ","i":79717},{"w":"`` I am very glad to know all this , '' ","i":80083},{"w":"`` Well , my dear Penelope , you need not be so alarmed about him . I did invite him , you know . I sent him away with smiles . When I found he was really going to his friends at Thornberry Park for the whole day to-morrow , I had compassion on him . '' ","i":82127},{"w":"`` I am extremely glad , indeed , '' ","i":83851},{"w":"`` particularly glad that this should happen ; and that of two sisters , who both deserve equally well , and who have always been such good friends , the pleasant prospect of one should not be dimming those of the other -- that they should be so equal in their prosperity and comfort . I hope your father and mother are quite happy with regard to both . '' ","i":83863},{"w":"`` Such excellent parents as Mr and Mrs Musgrove , '' ","i":84110},{"w":"`` should be happy in their children 's marriages . They do everything to confer happiness , I am sure . What a blessing to young people to be in such hands ! Your father and mother seem so totally free from all those ambitious feelings which have led to so much misconduct and misery , both in young and old . I hope you think Louisa perfectly recovered now ? '' ","i":84124},{"w":"`` That can not be much to your taste , I know , '' ","i":84286},{"w":"`` but I do believe him to be an excellent young man . '' ","i":84303},{"w":"`` No , '' ","i":85684},{"w":"`` it can not be Mr Elliot , I assure you . He was to leave Bath at nine this morning , and does not come back till to-morrow . '' ","i":85693},{"w":"`` I am not one of those who neglect the reigning power to bow to the rising sun . If I would not go for the sake of your father , I should think it scandalous to go for the sake of his heir . What is Mr Elliot to me ? '' ","i":86537},{"w":"`` We had better put it off . Charles , you had much better go back and change the box for Tuesday . It would be a pity to be divided , and we should be losing Miss Anne , too , if there is a party at her father 's ; and I am sure neither Henrietta nor I should care at all for the play , if Miss Anne could not be with us . '' ","i":86706},{"w":"`` If it depended only on my inclination , ma'am , the party at home -LRB- excepting on Mary 's account -RRB- would not be the smallest impediment . I have no pleasure in the sort of meeting , and should be too happy to change it for a play , and with you . But , it had better not be attempted , perhaps . '' ","i":86809},{"w":"`` I am not yet so much changed , '' ","i":87053},{"w":"`` I do not wonder Captain Wentworth is delighted ! You see he can not put the card out of his hand . '' ","i":87721},{"w":"'' and it is very evident that I have been full of it too , ever since I entered the house , and learnt the extension of your plan and all that had happened , or my seeing him could never have gone so entirely out of my head . '' ","i":88295},{"w":"`` No , '' ","i":89811},{"w":"`` True , '' ","i":90054},{"w":"`` very true ; I did not recollect ; but what shall we say now , Captain Harville ? If the change be not from outward circumstances , it must be from within ; it must be nature , man 's nature , which has done the business for Captain Benwick . '' ","i":90061},{"w":"`` Your feelings may be the strongest , '' ","i":90202},{"w":"`` but the same spirit of analogy will authorise me to assert that ours are the most tender . Man is more robust than woman , but he is not longer lived ; which exactly explains my view of the nature of their attachments . Nay , it would be too hard upon you , if it were otherwise . You have difficulties , and privations , and dangers enough to struggle with . You are always labouring and toiling , exposed to every risk and hardship . Your home , country , friends , all quitted . Neither time , nor health , nor life , to be called your own . It would be hard , indeed '' ","i":90214},{"w":"`` There is no hurry on my side . I am only ready whenever you are . I am in very good anchorage here , '' ","i":90481},{"w":"`` well supplied , and want for nothing . No hurry for a signal at all . Well , Miss Elliot , '' ","i":90513},{"w":"`` Oh ! '' ","i":91073},{"w":"`` I hope I do justice to all that is felt by you , and by those who resemble you . God forbid that I should undervalue the warm and faithful feelings of any of my fellow-creatures ! I should deserve utter contempt if I dared to suppose that true attachment and constancy were known only by woman . No , I believe you capable of everything great and good in your married lives . I believe you equal to every important exertion , and to every domestic forbearance , so long as -- if I may be allowed the expression -- so long as you have an object . I mean while the woman you love lives , and lives for you . All the privilege I claim for my own sex -LRB- it is not a very enviable one ; you need not covet it -RRB- , is that of loving longest , when existence or when hope is gone . '' ","i":91081},{"w":"`` I am going home , and you have an engagement with your friend . To-night we may have the pleasure of all meeting again at your party , '' ","i":91341},{"w":"`` Good morning , God bless you ! '' ","i":91554},{"w":"`` I am afraid , ma'am , that it is not perfectly understood . Pray be so good as to mention to the other gentlemen that we hope to see your whole party this evening . I am afraid there had been some mistake ; and I wish you particularly to assure Captain Harville and Captain Wentworth , that we hope to see them both . '' ","i":92558},{"w":"`` To be sure I will , if you wish it . Charles , if you see Captain Harville anywhere , remember to give Miss Anne 's message . But indeed , my dear , you need not be uneasy . Captain Harville holds himself quite engaged , I 'll answer for it ; and Captain Wentworth the same , I dare say . '' ","i":92702},{"w":"`` You should have distinguished , '' ","i":94911},{"w":"`` I should have thought , '' ","i":95145},{"w":"`` that my manner to yourself might have spared you much or all of this . '' ","i":95155},{"w":"`` No , no ! your manner might be only the ease which your engagement to another man would give . I left you in this belief ; and yet , I was determined to see you again .

It is a thing of course among us , that every man is refused , till he offers . But why should you be cruel ? Let me plead for my -- present friend I can not call him , but for my former friend . Where can you look for a more suitable match ? Where could you expect a more gentlemanlike , agreeable man ? Let me recommend Mr Elliot .

'' ","i":74680},{"w":"`` Oh ! if these are your only objections , '' ","i":74872},{"w":"`` Mr Elliot is safe , and I shall give myself no more trouble about him .

Let him know me to be a friend of yours , and then he will think little of the trouble required , which it is very natural for him now , with so many affairs and engagements of his own , to avoid and get rid of as he can ; very natural , perhaps . Ninety-nine out of a hundred would do the same . Of course , he can not be aware of the importance to me . Well , my dear Miss Elliot , I hope and trust you will be very happy . Mr Elliot has sense to understand the value of such a woman . Your peace will not be shipwrecked as mine has been . You are safe in all worldly matters , and safe in his character . He will not be led astray ; he will not be misled by others to his ruin .

But I never heard it spoken of till two days ago . '' ","i":75408},{"w":"`` She could not make a very long history , I think , of one such little article of unfounded news . '' ","i":75630},{"w":"`` I have not seen Mr Elliot these three years , '' ","i":75876},{"w":"`` I beg your pardon , my dear Miss Elliot , '' ","i":75934},{"w":"`` I beg your pardon for the short answers I have been giving you , but I have been uncertain what I ought to do . I have been doubting and considering as to what I ought to tell you . There were many things to be taken into the account . One hates to be officious , to be giving bad impressions , making mischief . Even the smooth surface of family-union seems worth preserving , though there may be nothing durable beneath . However , I have determined ; I think I am right ; I think you ought to be made acquainted with Mr Elliot 's real character . Though I fully believe that , at present , you have not the smallest intention of accepting him , there is no saying what may happen . You might , some time or other , be differently affected towards him . Hear the truth , therefore , now , while you are unprejudiced . Mr Elliot is a man without heart or conscience ; a designing , wary , cold-blooded being , who thinks only of himself ; whom for his own interest or ease , would be guilty of any cruelty , or any treachery , that could be perpetrated without risk of his general character . He has no feeling for others . Those whom he has been the chief cause of leading into ruin , he can neglect and desert without the smallest compunction . He is totally beyond the reach of any sentiment of justice or compassion . Oh ! he is black at heart , hollow and black ! '' ","i":75956},{"w":"`` My expressions startle you . You must allow for an injured , angry woman . But I will try to command myself . I will not abuse him . I will only tell you what I have found him . Facts shall speak . He was the intimate friend of my dear husband , who trusted and loved him , and thought him as good as himself . The intimacy had been formed before our marriage . I found them most intimate friends ; and I , too , became excessively pleased with Mr Elliot , and entertained the highest opinion of him . At nineteen , you know , one does not think very seriously ; but Mr Elliot appeared to me quite as good as others , and much more agreeable than most others , and we were almost always together . We were principally in town , living in very good style . He was then the inferior in circumstances ; he was then the poor one ; he had chambers in the Temple , and it was as much as he could do to support the appearance of a gentleman . He had always a home with us whenever he chose it ; he was always welcome ; he was like a brother . My poor Charles , who had the finest , most generous spirit in the world , would have divided his last farthing with him ; and I know that his purse was open to him ; I know that he often assisted him . '' ","i":76256},{"w":"`` I know it all , I know it all , '' ","i":76626},{"w":"`` Mr Elliot , '' ","i":76875},{"w":"`` at that period of his life , had one object in view : to make his fortune , and by a rather quicker process than the law . He was determined to make it by marriage . He was determined , at least , not to mar it by an imprudent marriage ; and I know it was his belief -LRB- whether justly or not , of course I can not decide -RRB- , that your father and sister , in their civilities and invitations , were designing a match between the heir and the young lady , and it was impossible that such a match should have answered his ideas of wealth and independence . That was his motive for drawing back , I can assure you . He told me the whole story . He had no concealments with me . It was curious , that having just left you behind me in Bath , my first and principal acquaintance on marrying should be your cousin ; and that , through him , I should be continually hearing of your father and sister . He described one Miss Elliot , and I thought very affectionately of the other . '' ","i":76884},{"w":"`` This explains it . I found he had been used to hear of me . I could not comprehend how . What wild imaginations one forms where dear self is concerned ! How sure to be mistaken ! But I beg your pardon ; I have interrupted you . Mr Elliot married then completely for money ? The circumstances , probably , which first opened your eyes to his character . '' ","i":77166},{"w":"`` This is full of papers belonging to him , to my husband ; a small portion only of what I had to look over when I lost him . The letter I am looking for was one written by Mr Elliot to him before our marriage , and happened to be saved ; why , one can hardly imagine . But he was careless and immethodical , like other men , about those things ; and when I came to examine his papers , I found it with others still more trivial , from different people scattered here and there , while many letters and memorandums of real importance had been destroyed . Here it is ; I would not burn it , because being even then very little satisfied with Mr Elliot , I was determined to preserve every document of former intimacy . I have now another motive for being glad that I can produce it . '' ","i":77785},{"w":"`` The language , I know , is highly disrespectful . Though I have forgot the exact terms , I have a perfect impression of the general meaning . But it shows you the man . Mark his professions to my poor husband . Can any thing be stronger ? '' ","i":78236},{"w":"`` I can explain this too , '' ","i":78398},{"w":"`` Well , '' ","i":78992},{"w":"`` grant my friend the credit due to the establishment of the first point asserted . He saw you then at Lyme , and liked you so well as to be exceedingly pleased to meet with you again in Camden Place , as Miss Anne Elliot , and from that moment , I have no doubt , had a double motive in his visits there . But there was another , and an earlier , which I will now explain . If there is anything in my story which you know to be either false or improbable , stop me . My account states , that your sister 's friend , the lady now staying with you , whom I have heard you mention , came to Bath with Miss Elliot and Sir Walter as long ago as September -LRB- in short when they first came themselves -RRB- , and has been staying there ever since ; that she is a clever , insinuating , handsome woman , poor and plausible , and altogether such in situation and manner , as to give a general idea , among Sir Walter 's acquaintance , of her meaning to be Lady Elliot , and as general a surprise that Miss Elliot should be apparently , blind to the danger .

I considered your marrying him as certain , though he might not yet have made the offer , and I could no more speak the truth of him , than if he had been your husband . My heart bled for you , as I talked of happiness ; and yet he is sensible , he is agreeable , and with such a woman as you , it was not absolutely hopeless . He was very unkind to his first wife . They were wretched together . But she was too ignorant and giddy for respect , and he had never loved her . I was willing to hope that you must fare better .

The Admiral does not seem very ill , and I sincerely hope Bath will do him all the good he wants . I shall be truly glad to have them back again . Our neighbourhood can not spare such a pleasant family . But now for Louisa . I have something to communicate that will astonish you not a little . She and the Harvilles came on Tuesday very safely , and in the evening we went to ask her how she did , when we were rather surprised not to find Captain Benwick of the party , for he had been invited as well as the Harvilles ; and what do you think was the reason ? Neither more nor less than his being in love with Louisa , and not choosing to venture to Uppercross till he had had an answer from Mr Musgrove ; for it was all settled between him and her before she came away , and he had written to her father by Captain Harville . True , upon my honour ! Are not you astonished ? I shall be surprised at least if you ever received a hint of it , for I never did . Mrs Musgrove protests solemnly that she knew nothing of the matter . We are all very well pleased , however , for though it is not equal to her marrying Captain Wentworth , it is infinitely better than Charles Hayter ; and Mr Musgrove has written his consent , and Captain Benwick is expected to-day . Mrs Harville says her husband feels a good deal on his poor sister 's account ; but , however , Louisa is a great favourite with both . Indeed , Mrs Harville and I quite agree that we love her the better for having nursed her . Charles wonders what Captain Wentworth will say ; but if you remember , I never thought him attached to Louisa ; I never could see anything of it . And this is the end , you see , of Captain Benwick 's being supposed to be an admirer of yours . How Charles could take such a thing into his head was always incomprehensible to me .

He declares himself , that coming to Lyme for a month , did him more good than all the medicine he took ; and , that being by the sea , always makes him feel young again . Now , I can not help thinking it a pity that he does not live entirely by the sea . I do think he had better leave Uppercross entirely , and fix at Lyme . Do not you , Anne ? Do not you agree with me , that it is the best thing he could do , both for himself and Mrs Shirley ? She has cousins here , you know , and many acquaintance , which would make it cheerful for her , and I am sure she would be glad to get to a place where she could have medical attendance at hand , in case of his having another seizure . Indeed I think it quite melancholy to have such excellent people as Dr and Mrs Shirley , who have been doing good all their lives , wearing out their last days in a place like Uppercross , where , excepting our family , they seem shut out from all the world . I wish his friends would propose it to him . I really think they ought . And , as to procuring a dispensation , there could be no difficulty at his time of life , and with his character . My only doubt is , whether anything could persuade him to leave his parish . He is so very strict and scrupulous in his notions ; over-scrupulous I must say . Do not you think , Anne , it is being over-scrupulous ? Do not you think it is quite a mistaken point of conscience , when a clergyman sacrifices his health for the sake of duties , which may be just as well performed by another person ? And at Lyme too , only seventeen miles off , he would be near enough to hear , if people thought there was anything to complain of .
