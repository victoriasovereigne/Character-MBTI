I have in my pocket a manuscript , '' ","i":2789},{"w":"`` The exact date is 1742 .

'' ","i":4894},{"w":"`` The facts of the case are simple . Sir Charles Baskerville was in the habit every night before going to bed of walking down the famous yew alley of Baskerville Hall . The evidence of the Barrymores shows that this had been his custom . On the fourth of May Sir Charles had declared his intention of starting next day for London , and had ordered Barrymore to prepare his luggage . That night he went out as usual for his nocturnal walk , in the course of which he was in the habit of smoking a cigar . He never returned . At twelve o\u2019clock Barrymore , finding the hall door still open , became alarmed , and , lighting a lantern , went in search of his master . The day had been wet , and Sir Charles 's footmarks were easily traced down the alley . Halfway down this walk there is a gate which leads out on to the moor . There were indications that Sir Charles had stood for some little time here . He then proceeded down the alley , and it was at the far end of it that his body was discovered . One fact which has not been explained is the statement of Barrymore that his master 's footprints altered their character from the time that he passed the moor-gate , and that he appeared from thence onward to have been walking upon his toes . One Murphy , a gipsy horse-dealer , was on the moor at no great distance at the time , but he appears by his own confession to have been the worse for drink . He declares that he heard cries but is unable to state from what direction they came . No signs of violence were to be discovered upon Sir Charles 's person , and though the doctor 's evidence pointed to an almost incredible facial distortion -- so great that Dr. Mortimer refused at first to believe that it was indeed his friend and patient who lay before him -- it was explained that that is a symptom which is not unusual in cases of dyspnoea and death from cardiac exhaustion . This explanation was borne out by the post-mortem examination , which showed long-standing organic disease , and the coroner 's jury returned a verdict in accordance with the medical evidence . It is well that this is so , for it is obviously of the utmost importance that Sir Charles 's heir should settle at the Hall and continue the good work which has been so sadly interrupted . Had the prosaic finding of the coroner not finally put an end to the romantic stories which have been whispered in connection with the affair , it might have been difficult to find a tenant for Baskerville Hall . It is understood that the next of kin is Mr. Henry Baskerville , if he be still alive , the son of Sir Charles Baskerville 's younger brother .
