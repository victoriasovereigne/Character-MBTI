It 's clean in the two eyes of the Act of Parliament of 1700 , anent wrongous imprisonment . No sooner did I get the news than I petitioned the Lord Justice Clerk . I have his word to-day .

Then would follow a fresh delay till I got fresh authority , and they had disavowed the officer -- military man , notoriously ignorant of the law , and that -- I ken the cant of it .
