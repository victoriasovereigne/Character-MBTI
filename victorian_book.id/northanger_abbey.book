These Tilneys seem to swallow up everything else . '' ","i":33510},{"w":"`` Nay , Catherine . I think you can not stand out any longer now . The sacrifice is not much ; and to oblige such a friend -- I shall think you quite unkind , if you still refuse .

But historians are not accountable for the difficulty of learning to read ; and even you yourself , who do not altogether seem particularly friendly to very severe , very intense application , may perhaps be brought to acknowledge that it is very well worth-while to be tormented for two or three years of one 's life , for the sake of being able to read all the rest of it . Consider -- if reading had not been taught , Mrs. Radcliffe would have written in vain -- or perhaps might not have written at all . '' ","i":38401},{"w":"`` I have heard that something very shocking indeed will soon come out in London . '' ","i":39137},{"w":"`` My dear Eleanor , the riot is only in your own brain . The confusion there is scandalous . Miss Morland has been talking of nothing more dreadful than a new publication which is shortly to come out , in three duodecimo volumes , two hundred and seventy-six pages in each , with a frontispiece to the first , of two tombstones and a lantern -- do you understand ? And you , Miss Morland -- my stupid sister has mistaken all your clearest expressions . You talked of expected horrors in London -- and instead of instantly conceiving , as any rational creature would have done , that such words could relate only to a circulating library , she immediately pictured to herself a mob of three thousand men assembling in St. George 's Fields , the Bank attacked , the Tower threatened , the streets of London flowing with blood , a detachment of the Twelfth Light Dragoons -LRB- the hopes of the nation -RRB- called up from Northampton to quell the insurgents , and the gallant Captain Frederick Tilney , in the moment of charging at the head of his troop , knocked off his horse by a brickbat from an upper window . Forgive her stupidity . The fears of the sister have added to the weakness of the woman ; but she is by no means a simpleton in general . '' ","i":39492},{"w":"`` We shall get nothing more serious from him now , Miss Morland . He is not in a sober mood . But I do assure you that he must be entirely misunderstood , if he can ever appear to say an unjust thing of any woman at all , or an unkind one of me . '' ","i":39960},{"w":"`` Maria is gone . She was quite wild to go . She thought it would be something very fine . I can not say I admire her taste ; and for my part , I was determined from the first not to go , if they pressed me ever so much . '' ","i":40426},{"w":"`` I wish you could have gone too . It is a pity you could not all go . '' ","i":40493},{"w":"`` Thank you ; but it is quite a matter of indifference to me . Indeed , I would not have gone on any account . I was saying so to Emily and Sophia when you overtook us . '' ","i":40513},{"w":"`` Yes , my dear Catherine , it is so indeed ; your penetration has not deceived you . Oh ! That arch eye of yours ! It sees through everything . '' ","i":41082},{"w":"`` compose yourself . I am amazingly agitated , as you perceive . Let us sit down and talk in comfort . Well , and so you guessed it the moment you had my note ? Sly creature ! Oh ! My dear Catherine , you alone , who know my heart , can judge of my present happiness . Your brother is the most charming of men . I only wish I were more worthy of him . But what will your excellent father and mother say ? Oh ! Heavens ! When I think of them I am so agitated !

Oh ! Catherine , the many sleepless nights I have had on your brother 's account ! I would not have you suffer half what I have done ! I am grown wretchedly thin , I know ; but I will not pain you by describing my anxiety ; you have seen enough of it . I feel that I have betrayed myself perpetually -- so unguarded in speaking of my partiality for the church ! But my secret I was always sure would be safe with you . '' ","i":41693},{"w":"`` It is impossible , '' ","i":41945},{"w":"`` for parents to be more kind , or more desirous of their children 's happiness ; I have no doubt of their consenting immediately . '' ","i":41954},{"w":"`` Oh ! My sweet Catherine , in your generous heart I know it would signify nothing ; but we must not expect such disinterestedness in many . As for myself , I am sure I only wish our situations were reversed . Had I the command of millions , were I mistress of the whole world , your brother would be my only choice . '' ","i":42054},{"w":"`` Richmond ! '' ","i":42262},{"w":"`` Shall not you be late at Devizes ? '' ","i":43346},{"w":"`` Then why do you stay away so long ? '' ","i":43617},{"w":"`` Very true . I think like you there . If there is a good fortune on one side , there can be no occasion for any on the other . No matter which has it , so that there is enough . I hate the idea of one great fortune looking out for another . And to marry for money I think the wickedest thing in existence . Good day . We shall be very glad to see you at Fullerton , whenever it is convenient . '' ","i":44060},{"w":"`` Well , then , I only meant that your attributing my brother 's wish of dancing with Miss Thorpe to good nature alone convinced me of your being superior in good nature yourself to all the rest of the world .

It would be hideous to be always together ; we should be the jest of the place . And so you are going to Northanger ! I am amazingly glad of it . It is one of the finest old places in England , I understand . I shall depend upon a most particular description of it . '' ","i":49606},{"w":"`` Nay , my sweetest Catherine , this is being quite absurd ! Modesty , and all that , is very well in its way , but really a little common honesty is sometimes quite as becoming . I have no idea of being so overstrained ! It is fishing for compliments . His attentions were such as a child must have noticed . And it was but half an hour before he left Bath that you gave him the most positive encouragement . He says so in this letter , says that he as good as made you an offer , and that you received his advances in the kindest way ; and now he wants me to urge his suit , and say all manner of pretty things to you . So it is in vain to affect ignorance . '' ","i":49904},{"w":"`` What ! Always to be watched , in person or by proxy !

Not that James has ever told me so , but I am sure he is very uncomfortable . '' ","i":52608},{"w":"`` I think Mr. Morland would acknowledge a difference . No man is offended by another man 's admiration of the woman he loves ; it is the woman only who can make it a torment . '' ","i":52694},{"w":"`` It is probable that she will neither love so well , nor flirt so well , as she might do either singly . The gentlemen must each give up a little . '' ","i":52846},{"w":"`` Then you do not believe Isabella so very much attached to my brother ? '' ","i":52889},{"w":"`` Well , '' ","i":53100},{"w":"`` you may be able to guess at your brother 's intentions from all this ; but I am sure I can not .

'' ","i":55113},{"w":"`` This is strange indeed ! I did not expect such a sight as this ! An immense heavy chest ! What can it hold ? Why should it be placed here ?

'' ","i":57575},{"w":"`` It is impossible to say how many generations it has been here . How it came to be first put in this room I know not , but I have not had it moved , because I thought it might sometimes be of use in holding hats and bonnets .

Consult your own understanding , your own sense of the probable , your own observation of what is passing around you . Does our education prepare us for such atrocities ? Do our laws connive at them ? Could they be perpetrated without being known , in a country like this , where social and literary intercourse is on such a footing , where every man is surrounded by a neighbourhood of voluntary spies , and where roads and newspapers lay everything open ?

Let me see ; Monday will be a busy day with you , we will not come on Monday ; and Tuesday will be a busy one with me . I expect my surveyor from Brockham with his report in the morning ; and afterwards I can not in decency fail attending the club . I really could not face my acquaintance if I stayed away now ; for , as I am known to be in the country , it would be taken exceedingly amiss ; and it is a rule with me , Miss Morland , never to give offence to any of my neighbours , if a small sacrifice of time and attention can prevent it . They are a set of very worthy men . They have half a buck from Northanger twice a year ; and I dine with them whenever I can . Tuesday , therefore , we may say is out of the question . But on Wednesday , I think , Henry , you may expect us ; and we shall be with you early , that we may have time to look about us . Two hours and three quarters will carry us to Woodston , I suppose ; we shall be in the carriage by ten ; so , about a quarter before one on Wednesday , you may look for us .
