It is not a scrambling collection of low single rooms , with as many roofs as windows ; it is not cramped into the vulgar compactness of a square farmhouse : it is a solid , roomy , mansion-like looking house , such as one might suppose a respectable old country family had lived in from generation to generation , through two centuries at least , and were now spending from two to three thousand a year in .

To think only of the licence which every rehearsal must tend to create . It is all very bad ! Put yourself in Miss Crawford 's place , Fanny . Consider what it would be to act Amelia with a stranger . She has a right to be felt for , because she evidently feels for herself . I heard enough of what she said to you last night to understand her unwillingness to be acting with a stranger ; and as she probably engaged in the part with different expectations -- perhaps without considering the subject enough to know what was likely to be -- it would be ungenerous , it would be really wrong to expose her to it .

He took me wholly by surprise . I had not an idea that his behaviour to me before had any meaning ; and surely I was not to be teaching myself to like him only because he was taking what seemed very idle notice of me . In my situation , it would have been the extreme of vanity to be forming expectations on Mr. Crawford . I am sure his sisters , rating him as they do , must have thought it so , supposing he had meant nothing . How , then , was I to be -- to be in love with him the moment he said he was with me ? How was I to have an attachment at his service , as soon as it was asked for ? His sisters should consider me as well as him . The higher his deserts , the more improper for me ever to have thought of him .

I told them that you were of all human creatures the one over whom habit had most power and novelty least ; and that the very circumstance of the novelty of Crawford 's addresses was against him . Their being so new and so recent was all in their disfavour ; that you could tolerate nothing that you were not used to ; and a great deal more to the same purpose , to give them a knowledge of your character . Miss Crawford made us laugh by her plans of encouragement for her brother .

' I suppose no time can ever wear out the impression I have of his looks and voice as he said those words . It was curious , very curious , that we should have such a scene to play ! If I had the power of recalling any one week of my existence , it should be that week -- that acting week . Say what you would , Fanny , it should be _ that _ ; for I never knew such exquisite happiness in any other . His sturdy spirit to bend as it did ! Oh ! it was sweet beyond expression . But alas , that very evening destroyed it all . That very evening brought your most unwelcome uncle . Poor Sir Thomas , who was glad to see you ? Yet , Fanny , do not imagine I would now speak disrespectfully of Sir Thomas , though I certainly did hate him for many a week . No , I do him justice now .

Oh ! that I could transport you for a short time into our circle in town , that you might understand how your power over Henry is thought of there ! Oh ! the envyings and heartburnings of dozens and dozens ; the wonder , the incredulity that will be felt at hearing what you have done ! For as to secrecy , Henry is quite the hero of an old romance , and glories in his chains . You should come to London to know how to estimate your conquest . If you were to see how he is courted , and how I am courted for his sake ! Now , I am well aware that I shall not be half so welcome to Mrs. Fraser in consequence of his situation with you . When she comes to know the truth she will , very likely , wish me in Northamptonshire again ; for there is a daughter of Mr. Fraser , by a first wife , whom she is wild to get married , and wants Henry to take . Oh ! she has been trying for him to such a degree . Innocent and quiet as you sit here , you can not have an idea of the _ sensation _ that you will be occasioning , of the curiosity there will be to see you , of the endless questions I shall have to answer ! Poor Margaret Fraser will be at me for ever about your eyes and your teeth , and how you do your hair , and who makes your shoes . I wish Margaret were married , for my poor friend 's sake , for I look upon the Frasers to be about as unhappy as most other married people . And yet it was a most desirable match for Janet at the time . We were all delighted . She could not do otherwise than accept him , for he was rich , and she had nothing ; but he turns out ill-tempered and _ exigeant _ , and wants a young woman , a beautiful young woman of five-and-twenty , to be as steady as himself . And my friend does not manage him well ; she does not seem to know how to make the best of it . There is a spirit of irritation which , to say nothing worse , is certainly very ill-bred . In their house I shall call to mind the conjugal manners of Mansfield Parsonage with respect . Even Dr. Grant does shew a thorough confidence in my sister , and a certain consideration for her judgment , which makes one feel there _ is _ attachment ; but of that I shall see nothing with the Frasers . I shall be at Mansfield for ever , Fanny . My own sister as a wife , Sir Thomas Bertram as a husband , are my standards of perfection . Poor Janet has been sadly taken in , and yet there was nothing improper on her side : she did not run into the match inconsiderately ; there was no want of foresight . She took three days to consider of his proposals , and during those three days asked the advice of everybody connected with her whose opinion was worth having , and especially applied to my late dear aunt , whose knowledge of the world made her judgment very generally and deservedly looked up to by all the young people of her acquaintance , and she was decidedly in favour of Mr. Fraser . This seems as if nothing were a security for matrimonial comfort . I have not so much to say for my friend Flora , who jilted a very nice young man in the Blues for the sake of that horrid Lord Stornaway , who has about as much sense , Fanny , as Mr. Rushworth , but much worse-looking , and with a blackguard character . I _ had _ my doubts at the time about her being right , for he has not even the air of a gentleman , and now I am sure she was wrong . By the bye , Flora Ross was dying for Henry the first winter she came out . But were I to attempt to tell you of all the women whom I have known to be in love with him , I should never have done . It is you , only you , insensible Fanny , who can think of him with anything like indifference . But are you so insensible as you profess yourself ? No , no , I see you are not . '' ","i":142447},{"w":"`` I will not say , '' ","i":143490},{"w":"`` that I was not half afraid at the time of its being so , for there was something in your look that frightened me , but not at first ; I was as unsuspicious of it at first -- indeed , indeed I was . It is as true as that I sit here . And had I had an idea of it , nothing should have induced me to accept the necklace . As to your brother 's behaviour , certainly I was sensible of a particularity : I had been sensible of it some little time , perhaps two or three weeks ; but then I considered it as meaning nothing : I put it down as simply being his way , and was as far from supposing as from wishing him to have any serious thoughts of me . I had not , Miss Crawford , been an inattentive observer of what was passing between him and some part of this family in the summer and autumn . I was quiet , but I was not blind . I could not but see that Mr. Crawford allowed himself in gallantries which did mean nothing . '' ","i":143500},{"w":"`` Ah ! I can not deny it . He has now and then been a sad flirt , and cared very little for the havoc he might be making in young ladies ' affections . I have often scolded him for it , but it is his only fault ; and there is this to be said , that very few young ladies have any affections worth caring for . And then , Fanny , the glory of fixing one who has been shot at by so many ; of having it in one 's power to pay off the debts of one 's sex ! Oh ! I am sure it is not in woman 's nature to refuse such a triumph . '' ","i":143700},{"w":"`` I do not defend him . I leave him entirely to your mercy , and when he has got you at Everingham , I do not care how much you lecture him . But this I will say , that his fault , the liking to make girls a little in love with him , is not half so dangerous to a wife 's happiness as a tendency to fall in love himself , which he has never been addicted to . And I do seriously and truly believe that he is attached to you in a way that he never was to any woman before ; that he loves you with all his heart , and will love you as nearly for ever as possible . If any man ever loved a woman for ever , I think Henry will do as much for you . '' ","i":143866},{"w":"`` I know he must have exerted himself very much , for I know the parties he had to move . The Admiral hates trouble , and scorns asking favours ; and there are so many young men 's claims to be attended to in the same way , that a friendship and energy , not very determined , is easily put by . What a happy creature William must be ! I wish we could see him .

At this very moment he is wild to see you , and occupied only in contriving the means for doing so , and for making his pleasure conduce to yours . In proof , he repeats , and more eagerly , what he said at Portsmouth about our conveying you home , and I join him in it with all my soul . Dear Fanny , write directly , and tell us to come . It will do us all good . He and I can go to the Parsonage , you know , and be no trouble to our friends at Mansfield Park . It would really be gratifying to see them all again , and a little addition of society might be of infinite use to them ; and as to yourself , you must feel yourself to be so wanted there , that you can not in conscience -- conscientious as you are -- keep away , when you have the means of returning .

Such a place as Sotherton Court deserves everything that taste and money can do . You have space to work upon there , and grounds that will well reward you . For my own part , if I had anything within the fiftieth part of the size of Sotherton , I should be always planting and improving , for naturally I am excessively fond of it . It would be too ridiculous for me to attempt anything where I am now , with my little half acre . It would be quite a burlesque . But if I had more room , I should take a prodigious delight in improving and planting . We did a vast deal in that way at the Parsonage : we made it quite a different place from what it was when we first had it . You young ones do not remember much about it , perhaps ; but if dear Sir Thomas were here , he could tell you what improvements we made : and a great deal more would have been done , but for poor Mr. Norris 's sad state of health . He could hardly ever get out , poor man , to enjoy anything , and _ that _ disheartened me from doing several things that Sir Thomas and I used to talk of . If it had not been for _ that _ , we should have carried on the garden wall , and made the plantation to shut out the churchyard , just as Dr. Grant has done . We were always doing something as it was . It was only the spring twelvemonth before Mr. Norris 's death that we put in the apricot against the stable wall , which is now grown such a noble tree , and getting to such perfection , sir , '' ","i":20301},{"w":"`` that Dr. Grant hardly knows what the natural taste of our apricot is : he is scarcely ever indulged with one , for it is so valuable a fruit ; with a little assistance , and ours is such a remarkably large , fair sort , that what with early tarts and preserves , my cook contrives to get them all .

I think nobody can justly accuse me of sparing myself upon any occasion , but really I can not do everything at once . And as for Fanny 's just stepping down to my house for me -- it is not much above a quarter of a mile -- I can not think I was unreasonable to ask it .

Nor must you be fancying that the invitation is meant as any particular compliment to _ you _ ; the compliment is intended to your uncle and aunt and me .

And round their enormous great wide table , too , which fills up the room so dreadfully ! Had the doctor been contented to take my dining-table when I came away , as anybody in their senses would have done , instead of having that absurd new one of his own , which is wider , literally wider than the dinner-table here , how infinitely better it would have been ! and how much more he would have been respected ! for people are never respected when they step out of their proper sphere .

But you have now shewn me that you can be wilful and perverse ; that you can and will decide for yourself , without any consideration or deference for those who have surely some right to guide you , without even asking their advice . You have shewn yourself very , very different from anything that I had imagined . The advantage or disadvantage of your family , of your parents , your brothers and sisters , never seems to have had a moment 's share in your thoughts on this occasion . How _ they _ might be benefited , how _ they _ must rejoice in such an establishment for you , is nothing to _ you _ .

Here is a young man of sense , of character , of temper , of manners , and of fortune , exceedingly attached to you , and seeking your hand in the most handsome and disinterested way ; and let me tell you , Fanny , that you may live eighteen years longer in the world without being addressed by a man of half Mr. Crawford 's estate , or a tenth part of his merits . Gladly would I have bestowed either of my own daughters on him . Maria is nobly married ; but had Mr. Crawford sought Julia 's hand , I should have given it to him with superior and more heartfelt satisfaction than I gave Maria 's to Mr. Rushworth .

I have no fears and no scruples . And as to my father 's being absent , it is so far from an objection , that I consider it rather as a motive ; for the expectation of his return must be a very anxious period to my mother ; and if we can be the means of amusing that anxiety , and keeping up her spirits for the next few weeks , I shall think our time very well spent , and so , I am sure , will he .

Wear the necklace , as you are engaged to do , to-morrow evening , and let the chain , which was not ordered with any reference to the ball , be kept for commoner occasions . This is my advice . I would not have the shadow of a coolness between the two whose intimacy I have been observing with the greatest pleasure , and in whose characters there is so much general resemblance in true generosity and natural delicacy as to make the few slight differences , resulting principally from situation , no reasonable hindrance to a perfect friendship .

I speak rather of the past , however , than the present . There is now a spirit of improvement abroad ; but among those who were ordained twenty , thirty , forty years ago , the larger number , to judge by their performance , must have thought reading was reading , and preaching was preaching . It is different now . The subject is more justly considered . It is felt that distinctness and energy may have weight in recommending the most solid truths ; and besides , there is more general observation and taste , a more critical knowledge diffused than formerly ; in every congregation there is a larger proportion who know a little of the matter , and who can judge and criticise .

It is more difficult to speak well than to compose well ; that is , the rules and trick of composition are oftener an object of study . A thoroughly good sermon , thoroughly well delivered , is a capital gratification . I can never hear such a one without the greatest admiration and respect , and more than half a mind to take orders and preach myself . There is something in the eloquence of the pulpit , when it is really eloquence , which is entitled to the highest praise and honour . The preacher who can touch and affect such an heterogeneous mass of hearers , on subjects limited , and long worn threadbare in all common hands ; who can say anything new or striking , anything that rouses the attention without offending the taste , or wearing out the feelings of his hearers , is a man whom one could not , in his public capacity , honour enough .

I was afraid of the bias of those worldly maxims , which she has been too much used to hear . But it was very different . She spoke of you , Fanny , just as she ought . She desires the connexion as warmly as your uncle or myself . We had a long talk about it . I should not have mentioned the subject , though very anxious to know her sentiments ; but I had not been in the room five minutes before she began introducing it with all that openness of heart , and sweet peculiarity of manner , that spirit and ingenuousness which are so much a part of herself .

I have told you the substance of all that she said . As soon as I could speak , I replied that I had not supposed it possible , coming in such a state of mind into that house as I had done , that anything could occur to make me suffer more , but that she had been inflicting deeper wounds in almost every sentence . That though I had , in the course of our acquaintance , been often sensible of some difference in our opinions , on points , too , of some moment , it had not entered my imagination to conceive the difference could be such as she had now proved it . That the manner in which she treated the dreadful crime committed by her brother and my sister -LRB- with whom lay the greater seduction I pretended not to say -RRB- , but the manner in which she spoke of the crime itself , giving it every reproach but the right ; considering its ill consequences only as they were to be braved or overborne by a defiance of decency and impudence in wrong ; and last of all , and above all , recommending to us a compliance , a compromise , an acquiescence in the continuance of the sin , on the chance of a marriage which , thinking as I now thought of her brother , should rather be prevented than sought ; all this together most grievously convinced me that I had never understood her before , and that , as far as related to mind , it had been the creature of my own imagination , not Miss Crawford , that I had been too apt to dwell on for many months past . That , perhaps , it was best for me ; I had less to regret in sacrificing a friendship , feelings , hopes which must , at any rate , have been torn from me now . And yet , that I must and would confess that , could I have restored her to what she had appeared to me before , I would infinitely prefer any increase of the pain of parting , for the sake of carrying with me the right of tenderness and esteem . This is what I said , the purport of it ; but , as you may imagine , not spoken so collectedly or methodically as I have repeated it to you . She was astonished , exceedingly astonished -- more than astonished . I saw her change countenance . She turned extremely red . I imagined I saw a mixture of many feelings : a great , though short struggle ; half a wish of yielding to truths , half a sense of shame , but habit , habit carried it . She would have laughed if she could . It was a sort of laugh , as she answered , ` A pretty good lecture , upon my word . Was it part of your last sermon ? At this rate you will soon reform everybody at Mansfield and Thornton Lacey ; and when I hear of you next , it may be as a celebrated preacher in some great society of Methodists , or as a missionary into foreign parts . ' She tried to speak carelessly , but she was not so careless as she wanted to appear . I only said in reply , that from my heart I wished her well , and earnestly hoped that she might soon learn to think more justly , and not owe the most valuable knowledge we could any of us acquire , the knowledge of ourselves and of our duty , to the lessons of affliction , and immediately left the room . I had gone a few steps , Fanny , when I heard the door open behind me . ` Mr. Bertram , ' said she . I looked back . ` Mr. Bertram , ' said she , with a smile ; but it was a smile ill-suited to the conversation that had passed , a saucy playful smile , seeming to invite in order to subdue me ; at least it appeared so to me . I resisted ; it was the impulse of the moment to resist , and still walked on . I have since , sometimes , for a moment , regretted that I did not go back , but I know I was right , and such has been the end of our acquaintance . And what an acquaintance has it been ! How have I been deceived ! Equally in brother and sister deceived ! I thank you for your patience , Fanny . This has been the greatest relief , and now we will have done .

There was no recovering the complexion from the moment that I spoke of ` Fanny , ' and spoke of her as a sister should . But Mrs. Rushworth 's day of good looks will come ; we have cards for her first party on the 28th . Then she will be in beauty , for she will open one of the best houses in Wimpole Street . I was in it two years ago , when it was Lady Lascelle 's , and prefer it to almost any I know in London , and certainly she will then feel , to use a vulgar phrase , that she has got her pennyworth for her penny . Henry could not have afforded her such a house . I hope she will recollect it , and be satisfied , as well as she may , with moving the queen of a palace , though the king may appear best in the background ; and as I have no desire to tease her , I shall never _ force _ your name upon her again . She will grow sober by degrees . From all that I hear and guess , Baron Wildenheim 's attentions to Julia continue , but I do not know that he has any serious encouragement . She ought to do better . A poor honourable is no catch , and I can not imagine any liking in the case , for take away his rants , and the poor baron has nothing . What a difference a vowel makes ! If his rents were but equal to his rants ! Your cousin Edmund moves slowly ; detained , perchance , by parish duties . There may be some old woman at Thornton Lacey to be converted . I am unwilling to fancy myself neglected for a _ young _ one . Adieu ! my dear sweet Fanny , this is a long letter from London : write me a pretty one in reply to gladden Henry 's eyes , when he comes back , and send me an account of all the dashing young captains whom you disdain for his sake .
