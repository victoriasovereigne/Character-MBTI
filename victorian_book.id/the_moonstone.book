'' ","i":144131},{"w":"`` It 's the easiest difficulty to deal with of all , '' ","i":144176},{"w":"`` Because no Indian , Mr. Bruff , ever runs an unnecessary risk . The clause you drew in Colonel Herncastle 's Will , informed them -LRB- did n't it ? -RRB- that the Moonstone was to pass absolutely into Miss Verinder 's possession on her birthday . Very well . Tell me which was the safest course for men in their position ? To make their attempt on the Diamond while it was under the control of Mr. Franklin Blake , who had shown already that he could suspect and outwit them ? Or to wait till the Diamond was at the disposal of a young girl , who would innocently delight in wearing the magnificent jewel at every possible opportunity ? Perhaps you want a proof that my theory is correct ? Take the conduct of the Indians themselves as the proof . They appeared at the house , after waiting all those weeks , on Miss Verinder 's birthday ; and they were rewarded for the patient accuracy of their calculations by seeing the Moonstone in the bosom of her dress ! When I heard the story of the Colonel and the Diamond , later in the evening , I felt so sure about the risk Mr. Franklin Blake had run -LRB- they would have certainly attacked him , if he had not happened to ride back to Lady Verinder 's in the company of other people -RRB- ; and I was so strongly convinced of the worse risk still , in store for Miss Verinder , that I recommended following the Colonel 's plan , and destroying the identity of the gem by having it cut into separate stones . How its extraordinary disappearance that night , made my advice useless , and utterly defeated the Hindoo plot -- and how all further action on the part of the Indians was paralysed the next day by their confinement in prison as rogues and vagabonds -- you know as well as I do . The first act in the conspiracy closes there . Before we go on to the second , may I ask whether I have met your difficulty , with an explanation which is satisfactory to the mind of a practical man ? '' ","i":144346},{"w":"`` So far , so good , '' ","i":144768},{"w":"`` The first chance the Indians had of seizing the Diamond was a chance lost , on the day when they were committed to the prison at Frizinghall . When did the second chance offer itself ? The second chance offered itself -- as I am in a condition to prove -- while they were still in confinement . '' ","i":144780},{"w":"`` I was staying , '' ","i":144859},{"w":"`` with some friends at Frizinghall , at the time . A day or two before the Indians were set free -LRB- on a Monday , I think -RRB- , the governor of the prison came to me with a letter . It had been left for the Indians by one Mrs. Macann , of whom they had hired the lodging in which they lived ; and it had been delivered at Mrs. Macann 's door , in ordinary course of post , on the previous morning . The prison authorities had noticed that the postmark was ` Lambeth , ' and that the address on the outside , though expressed in correct English , was , in form , oddly at variance with the customary method of directing a letter . On opening it , they had found the contents to be written in a foreign language , which they rightly guessed at as Hindustani . Their object in coming to me was , of course , to have the letter translated to them . I took a copy in my pocket-book of the original , and of my translation -- and there they are at your service . '' ","i":144868},{"w":"`` I can explain the first sentence to you , '' ","i":145245},{"w":"`` and the conduct of the Indians themselves will explain the rest . The god of the moon is represented , in the Hindoo mythology , as a four-armed deity , seated on an antelope ; and one of his titles is the regent of the night . Here , then , to begin with , is something which looks suspiciously like an indirect reference to the Moonstone . Now , let us see what the Indians did , after the prison authorities had allowed them to receive their letter . On the very day when they were set free they went at once to the railway station , and took their places in the first train that started for London . We all thought it a pity at Frizinghall that their proceedings were not privately watched . But , after Lady Verinder had dismissed the police-officer , and had stopped all further inquiry into the loss of the Diamond , no one else could presume to stir in the matter . The Indians were free to go to London , and to London they went . What was the next news we heard of them , Mr. Bruff ? '' ","i":145259},{"w":"`` You shall give me a piece of information in your turn before we go on , '' ","i":145730},{"w":"`` Very well , '' ","i":145899},{"w":"`` let us leave it to time to clear the matter up . In the meanwhile , Mr. Bruff , we must get back again to the Indians , on your account . Their journey to London simply ended in their becoming the victims of another defeat . The loss of their second chance of seizing the Diamond is mainly attributable , as I think , to the cunning and foresight of Mr. Luker -- who does n't stand at the top of the prosperous and ancient profession of usury for nothing ! By the prompt dismissal of the man in his employment , he deprived the Indians of the assistance which their confederate would have rendered them in getting into the house . By the prompt transport of the Moonstone to his banker 's , he took the conspirators by surprise before they were prepared with a new plan for robbing him . How the Indians , in this latter case , suspected what he had done , and how they contrived to possess themselves of his banker 's receipt , are events too recent to need dwelling on . Let it be enough to say that they know the Moonstone to be once more out of their reach ; deposited -LRB- under the general description of ` a valuable of great price ' -RRB- in a banker 's strong room . Now , Mr. Bruff , what is their third chance of seizing the Diamond ? and when will it come ?

Well ! that was also the time when my uncle Herncastle returned from India . My father discovered that his brother-in-law was in possession of certain papers which were likely to be of service to him in his lawsuit . He called on the Colonel , on pretence of welcoming him back to England . The Colonel was not to be deluded in that way . ` You want something , ' he said , ` or you would never have compromised your reputation by calling on ME . ' My father saw that the one chance for him was to show his hand ; he admitted , at once , that he wanted the papers . The Colonel asked for a day to consider his answer . His answer came in the shape of a most extraordinary letter , which my friend the lawyer showed me . The Colonel began by saying that he wanted something of my father , and that he begged to propose an exchange of friendly services between them . The fortune of war -LRB- that was the expression he used -RRB- had placed him in possession of one of the largest Diamonds in the world ; and he had reason to believe that neither he nor his precious jewel was safe in any house , in any quarter of the globe , which they occupied together . Under these alarming circumstances , he had determined to place his Diamond in the keeping of another person . That person was not expected to run any risk . He might deposit the precious stone in any place especially guarded and set apart -- like a banker 's or jeweller 's strong-room -- for the safe custody of valuables of high price . His main personal responsibility in the matter was to be of the passive kind . He was to undertake either by himself , or by a trustworthy representative -- to receive at a prearranged address , on certain prearranged days in every year , a note from the Colonel , simply stating the fact that he was a living man at that date . In the event of the date passing over without the note being received , the Colonel 's silence might be taken as a sure token of the Colonel 's death by murder . In that case , and in no other , certain sealed instructions relating to the disposal of the Diamond , and deposited with it , were to be opened , and followed implicitly . If my father chose to accept this strange charge , the Colonel 's papers were at his disposal in return . That was the letter . '' ","i":17187},{"w":"`` Do ? '' ","i":17669},{"w":"`` Let 's finish the story of the Colonel first , '' ","i":17981},{"w":"`` My father , '' ","i":18095},{"w":"`` got the papers he wanted , and never saw his brother-in-law again from that time . Year after year , on the prearranged days , the prearranged letter came from the Colonel , and was opened by Mr. Bruff . I have seen the letters , in a heap , all of them written in the same brief , business-like form of words : ` Sir , -- This is to certify that I am still a living man . Let the Diamond be . John Herncastle . ' That was all he ever wrote , and that came regularly to the day ; until some six or eight months since , when the form of the letter varied for the first time . It ran now : ` Sir , -- They tell me I am dying . Come to me , and help me to make my will . ' Mr. Bruff went , and found him , in the little suburban villa , surrounded by its own grounds , in which he had lived alone , ever since he had left India . He had dogs , cats , and birds to keep him company ; but no human being near him , except the person who came daily to do the house-work , and the doctor at the bedside . The will was a very simple matter . The Colonel had dissipated the greater part of his fortune in his chemical investigations . His will began and ended in three clauses , which he dictated from his bed , in perfect possession of his faculties . The first clause provided for the safe keeping and support of his animals . The second founded a professorship of experimental chemistry at a northern university . The third bequeathed the Moonstone as a birthday present to his niece , on condition that my father would act as executor . My father at first refused to act . On second thoughts , however , he gave way , partly because he was assured that the executorship would involve him in no trouble ; partly because Mr. Bruff suggested , in Rachel 's interest , that the Diamond might be worth something , after all . '' ","i":18103},{"w":"`` He not only gave the reason -- he had the reason written in his will , '' ","i":18505},{"w":"`` Not possessing my father 's excellent common sense , '' ","i":18814},{"w":"`` I believe the Colonel 's life was threatened , exactly as the Colonel said . The sealed instructions , as I think , explain how it was that he died , after all , quietly in his bed . In the event of his death by violence -LRB- that is to say , in the absence of the regular letter from him at the appointed date -RRB- , my father was then directed to send the Moonstone secretly to Amsterdam . It was to be deposited in that city with a famous diamond-cutter , and it was to be cut up into from four to six separate stones . The stones were then to be sold for what they would fetch , and the proceeds were to be applied to the founding of that professorship of experimental chemistry , which the Colonel has since endowed by his Will . Now , Betteredge , exert those sharp wits of yours , and observe the conclusion to which the Colonel 's instructions point ! '' ","i":18829},{"w":"`` Remark , '' ","i":19041},{"w":"`` that the integrity of the Diamond , as a whole stone , is here artfully made dependent on the preservation from violence of the Colonel 's life . He is not satisfied with saying to the enemies he dreads , ` Kill me -- and you will be no nearer to the Diamond than you are now ; it is where you ca n't get at it -- in the guarded strong-room of a bank . ' He says instead , ` Kill me -- and the Diamond will be the Diamond no longer ; its identity will be destroyed . ' What does that mean ? '' ","i":19049},{"w":"`` Nothing of the sort , '' ","i":19201},{"w":"`` A plot organised among the Indians who originally owned the jewel , '' ","i":19360},{"w":"`` a plot with some old Hindoo superstition at the bottom of it . That is my opinion , confirmed by a family paper which I have about me at this moment . '' ","i":19378},{"w":"`` I do n't want to force my opinion on you , '' ","i":19443},{"w":"`` I was not very willing , when I discovered the story of the Moonstone , '' ","i":19638},{"w":"`` to be the means of bringing it here . But Mr. Bruff reminded me that somebody must put my cousin 's legacy into my cousin 's hands -- and that I might as well do it as anybody else . After taking the Diamond out of the bank , I fancied I was followed in the streets by a shabby , dark-complexioned man . I went to my father 's house to pick up my luggage , and found a letter there , which unexpectedly detained me in London . I went back to the bank with the Diamond , and thought I saw the shabby man again . Taking the Diamond once more out of the bank this morning , I saw the man for the third time , gave him the slip , and started -LRB- before he recovered the trace of me -RRB- by the morning instead of the afternoon train . Here I am , with the Diamond safe and sound -- and what is the first news that meets me ? I find that three strolling Indians have been at the house , and that my arrival from London , and something which I am expected to have about me , are two special objects of investigation to them when they believe themselves to be alone . I do n't waste time and words on their pouring the ink into the boy 's hand , and telling him to look in it for a man at a distance , and for something in that man 's pocket . The thing -LRB- which I have often seen done in the East -RRB- is ` hocus-pocus ' in my opinion , as it is in yours . The present question for us to decide is , whether I am wrongly attaching a meaning to a mere accident ? or whether we really have evidence of the Indians being on the track of the Moonstone , the moment it is removed from the safe keeping of the bank ? '' ","i":19659},{"w":"`` What are you thinking of ? '' ","i":20044},{"w":"`` If you have got the value of the stone in your pocket , '' ","i":20091},{"w":"`` say so , Betteredge , and in it goes ! '' ","i":20110},{"w":"`` Betteredge , '' ","i":20238},{"w":"`` we must face the question of the Colonel 's motive in leaving this legacy to his niece , for my aunt 's sake . Bear in mind how Lady Verinder treated her brother from the time when he returned to England , to the time when he told you he should remember his niece 's birthday . And read that . '' ","i":20245},{"w":"`` Well , '' ","i":20768},{"w":"`` now you have read the Colonel 's own statement , what do you say ? In bringing the Moonstone to my aunt 's house , am I serving his vengeance blindfold , or am I vindicating him in the character of a penitent and Christian man ? '' ","i":20776},{"w":"`` Let 's extract the inner meaning of this , '' ","i":21055},{"w":"`` That 's the Subjective view , '' ","i":21180},{"w":"`` I can see , '' ","i":21353},{"w":"`` that the Colonel 's object may , quite possibly , have been -- not to benefit his niece , whom he had never even seen -- but to prove to his sister that he had died forgiving her , and to prove it very prettily by means of a present made to her child . There is a totally different explanation from yours , Betteredge , taking its rise in a Subjective-Objective point of view . From all I can see , one interpretation is just as likely to be right as the other . '' ","i":21363},{"w":"`` I do n't want to alarm my aunt without reason , '' ","i":21938},{"w":"`` Wait .

'' ","i":24723},{"w":"`` It depends , '' ","i":24779},{"w":"`` on what the boy can really do . If he can see the Diamond through the iron safe of the bank at Frizinghall , we shall be troubled with no more visits from the Indians for the present .

Send the Diamond to-morrow -LRB- under guard of more than one man -RRB- to be cut up at Amsterdam . Make half a dozen diamonds of it , instead of one .

Keep about the house , Betteredge , till I come back , and try what you can make of Rosanna Spearman . I do n't ask you to do anything degrading to your own self-respect , or anything cruel towards the girl . I only ask you to exercise your observation more carefully than usual .

'' ","i":70673},{"w":"`` I was knocking the balls about , '' ","i":70694},{"w":"`` and trying to get this miserable business of the Diamond out of my mind . I happened to look up -- and there stood Rosanna Spearman at the side of me , like a ghost ! Her stealing on me in that way was so strange , that I hardly knew what to do at first . Seeing a very anxious expression in her face , I asked her if she wished to speak to me . She answered , ` Yes , if I dare . ' Knowing what suspicion attached to her , I could only put one construction on such language as that . I confess it made me uncomfortable . I had no wish to invite the girl 's confidence . At the same time , in the difficulties that now beset us , I could hardly feel justified in refusing to listen to her , if she was really bent on speaking to me . It was an awkward position ; and I dare say I got out of it awkwardly enough . I said to her , ` I do n't quite understand you . Is there anything you want me to do ? ' Mind , Betteredge , I did n't speak unkindly ! The poor girl ca n't help being ugly -- I felt that , at the time . The cue was still in my hand , and I went on knocking the balls about , to take off the awkwardness of the thing . As it turned out , I only made matters worse still . I 'm afraid I mortified her without meaning it ! She suddenly turned away . ` He looks at the billiard balls , ' I heard her say . ` Anything rather than look at _ me _ ! ' Before I could stop her , she had left the hall . I am not quite easy about it , Betteredge . Would you mind telling Rosanna that I meant no unkindness ?

If you will reflect , you will see that the man must have had some pretty strict instructions from the Indians .

Under those circumstances , the Indians , you may rely on it , would insist on having a description of the room -- of its position in the house , of its capability of being approached from the outside , and so on . What was the man to do , with such orders as these ? Just what he did ! He ran up-stairs to get a look at the room , before the sailor was taken into it . He was found there , making his observations -- and he shammed drunk , as the easiest way of getting out of the difficulty . That 's how I read the riddle . After he was turned out of the public-house , he probably went with his report to the place where his employers were waiting for him . And his employers , no doubt , sent him back to make sure that the sailor was really settled at the public-house till the next morning .

In my place , you would have seen him sinking , hour by hour ; and you would have risked anything , rather than let the one man on earth who had befriended you , die before your eyes . Do n't suppose that I had no sense of the terrible position in which I had placed myself ! There were moments when I felt all the misery of my friendlessness , all the peril of my dreadful responsibility . If I had been a happy man , if I had led a prosperous life , I believe I should have sunk under the task I had imposed on myself . But I had no happy time to look back at , no past peace of mind to force itself into contrast with my present anxiety and suspense -- and I held firm to my resolution through it all . I took an interval in the middle of the day , when my patient 's condition was at its best , for the repose I needed . For the rest of the four-and-twenty hours , as long as his life was in danger , I never left his bedside . Towards sunset , as usual in such cases , the delirium incidental to the fever came on . It lasted more or less through the night ; and then intermitted , at that terrible time in the early morning -- from two o\u2019clock to five -- when the vital energies even of the healthiest of us are at their lowest . It is then that Death gathers in his human harvest most abundantly . It was then that Death and I fought our fight over the bed , which should have the man who lay on it . I never hesitated in pursuing the treatment on which I had staked everything . When wine failed , I tried brandy . When the other stimulants lost their influence , I doubled the dose . After an interval of suspense -- the like of which I hope to God I shall never feel again -- there came a day when the rapidity of the pulse slightly , but appreciably , diminished ; and , better still , there came also a change in the beat -- an unmistakable change to steadiness and strength . THEN , I knew that I had saved him ; and then I own I broke down . I laid the poor fellow 's wasted hand back on the bed , and burst out crying . An hysterical relief , Mr. Blake -- nothing more !

' It is all confusion to begin with ; but it may be all brought into order and shape , if you can only find the right way . Acting on this plan , I filled in each blank space on the paper , with what the words or phrases on either side of it suggested to me as the speaker 's meaning ; altering over and over again , until my additions followed naturally on the spoken words which came before them , and fitted naturally into the spoken words which came after them . The result was , that I not only occupied in this way many vacant and anxious hours , but that I arrived at something which was -LRB- as it seemed to me -RRB- a confirmation of the theory that I held . In plainer words , after putting the broken sentences together I found the superior faculty of thinking going on , more or less connectedly , in my patient 's mind , while the inferior faculty of expression was in a state of almost complete incapacity and confusion .

But the harm is done ; the wrong is beyond all remedy . I decline to weary or distress you , sir , if I can help it . At the outset of my career in this country , the vile slander to which I have referred struck me down at once and for ever . I resigned my aspirations in my profession -- obscurity was the only hope left for me . I parted with the woman I loved -- how could I condemn her to share my disgrace ? A medical assistant 's place offered itself , in a remote corner of England . I got the place . It promised me peace ; it promised me obscurity , as I thought . I was wrong . Evil report , with time and chance to help it , travels patiently , and travels far . The accusation from which I had fled followed me . I got warning of its approach . I was able to leave my situation voluntarily , with the testimonials that I had earned . They got me another situation in another remote district . Time passed again ; and again the slander that was death to my character found me out . On this occasion I had no warning . My employer said , ` Mr. Jennings , I have no complaint to make against you ; but you must set yourself right , or leave me . ' I had but one choice -- I left him . It 's useless to dwell on what I suffered after that . I am only forty years old now . Look at my face , and let it tell for me the story of some miserable years . It ended in my drifting to this place , and meeting with Mr. Candy . He wanted an assistant . I referred him , on the question of capacity , to my last employer . The question of character remained . I told him what I have told you -- and more . I warned him that there were difficulties in the way , even if he believed me . ` Here , as elsewhere , ' I said ` I scorn the guilty evasion of living under an assumed name : I am no safer at Frizinghall than at other places from the cloud that follows me , go where I may . ' He answered , ` I do n't do things by halves -- I believe you , and I pity you . If you will risk what may happen , I will risk it too . ' God Almighty bless him !

YOU assume that the Hindoo conspirators could by no possibility commit a mistake . The Indians went to Mr. Luker 's house after the Diamond -- and , therefore , in Mr. Luker 's possession the Diamond must be ! Have you any evidence to prove that the Moonstone was taken to London at all ? You ca n't even guess how , or by whom , it was removed from Lady Verinder 's house ! Have you any evidence that the jewel was pledged to Mr. Luker ? He declares that he never heard of the Moonstone ; and his bankers ' receipt acknowledges nothing but the deposit of a valuable of great price . The Indians assume that Mr. Luker is lying -- and you assume again that the Indians are right . All I say , in differing with you , is -- that my view is possible .
