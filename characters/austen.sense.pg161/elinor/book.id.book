He does not draw himself , indeed , but he has great pleasure in seeing the performances of other people , and I assure you he is by no means deficient in natural taste , though he has not had opportunities of improving it . Had he ever been in the way of learning , I think he would have drawn very well .

'' ","i":1251},{"w":"`` I hope , Marianne , '' ","i":1443},{"w":"`` you do not consider him as deficient in general taste .

The excellence of his understanding and his principles can be concealed only by that shyness which too often keeps him silent . You know enough of him to do justice to his solid worth . But of his minuter propensities , as you call them you have from peculiar circumstances been kept more ignorant than myself . He and I have been at times thrown a good deal together , while you have been wholly engrossed on the most affectionate principle by my mother . I have seen a great deal of him , have studied his sentiments and heard his opinion on subjects of literature and taste ; and , upon the whole , I venture to pronounce that his mind is well-informed , enjoyment of books exceedingly great , his imagination lively , his observation just and correct , and his taste delicate and pure . His abilities in every respect improve as much upon acquaintance as his manners and person . At first sight , his address is certainly not striking ; and his person can hardly be called handsome , till the expression of his eyes , which are uncommonly good , and the general sweetness of his countenance , is perceived . At present , I know him so well , that I think him really handsome ; or at least , almost so . What say you , Marianne ?

Believe them to be stronger than I have declared ; believe them , in short , to be such as his merit , and the suspicion -- the hope of his affection for me may warrant , without imprudence or folly . But farther than this you must not believe . I am by no means assured of his regard for me . There are moments when the extent of it seems doubtful ; and till his sentiments are fully known , you can not wonder at my wishing to avoid any encouragement of my own partiality , by believing or calling it more than it is . In my heart I feel little -- scarcely any doubt of his preference . But there are other points to be considered besides his inclination . He is very far from being independent . What his mother really is we can not know ; but , from Fanny 's occasional mention of her conduct and opinions , we have never been disposed to think her amiable ; and I am very much mistaken if Edward is not himself aware that there would be many difficulties in his way , if he were to wish to marry a woman who had not either a great fortune or high rank .

But how is your acquaintance to be long supported , under such extraordinary despatch of every subject for discourse ? You will soon have exhausted each favourite topic . Another meeting will suffice to explain his sentiments on picturesque beauty , and second marriages , and then you can have nothing farther to ask .

Seven years would be insufficient to make some people acquainted with each other , and seven days are more than enough for others .

I remember Fanny used to say that she would marry sooner and better than you did ; not but what she is exceedingly fond of YOU , but so it happened to strike her . She will be mistaken , however . I question whether Marianne NOW , will marry a man worth more than five or six hundred a-year , at the utmost , and I am very much deceived if YOU do not do better . Dorsetshire !

Had you married , you must have been always poor . His expensiveness is acknowledged even by himself , and his whole conduct declares that self-denial is a word hardly understood by him . His demands and your inexperience together , on a small , very small income , must have brought on distresses which would not be the LESS grievous to you , from having been entirely unknown and unthought of before . YOUR sense of honour and honesty would have led you , I know , when aware of your situation , to attempt all the economy that would appear to you possible : and , perhaps , as long as your frugality retrenched only on your own comfort , you might have been suffered to practice it , but beyond that -- and how little could the utmost of your single management do to stop the ruin which had begun before your marriage ? -- Beyond THAT , had you endeavoured , however reasonably , to abridge HIS enjoyments , is it not to be feared , that instead of prevailing on feelings so selfish to consent to it , you would have lessened your own influence on his heart , and made him regret the connection which had involved him in such difficulties ?

His circumstances are now unembarrassed -- he suffers from no evil of that kind ; and he thinks only that he has married a woman of a less amiable temper than yourself . But does it follow that had he married you , he would have been happy ? -- The inconveniences would have been different . He would then have suffered under the pecuniary distresses which , because they are removed , he now reckons as nothing . He would have had a wife of whose temper he could make no complaint , but he would have been always necessitous -- always poor ; and probably would soon have learned to rank the innumerable comforts of a clear estate and good income as of far more importance , even to domestic happiness , than the mere temper of a wife .

Music seems scarcely to attract him , and though he admires Elinor 's drawings very much , it is not the admiration of a person who can understand their worth . It is evident , in spite of his frequent attention to her while she draws , that in fact he knows nothing of the matter . He admires as a lover , not as a connoisseur . To satisfy me , those characters must be united . I could not be happy with a man whose taste did not in every point coincide with my own . He must enter into all my feelings ; the same books , the same music must charm us both . Oh ! mama , how spiritless , how tame was Edward 's manner in reading to us last night !
