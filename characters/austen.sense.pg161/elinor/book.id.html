a strength of understanding, and coolness of judgment, which qualified
her, though only nineteen, to be the counsellor of her (<font color='blue'><b>her</b></font>) mother, and
enabled her (<font color='blue'><b>her</b></font>) frequently to counteract, to the advantage of them all,
that eagerness of mind in Mrs. Dashwood which must generally have led
to imprudence. She (<font color='blue'><b>Dashwood</b></font>) had an excellent heart;--her (<font color='blue'><b>Dashwood</b></font>) disposition was
affectionate, and her (<font color='blue'><b>Dashwood</b></font>) feelings were strong; but she (<font color='blue'><b>Dashwood</b></font>) knew how to govern
them: it was a knowledge which her (<font color='blue'><b>Dashwood</b></font>) mother had yet to learn; and which
one of her (<font color='blue'><b>Dashwood</b></font>) sisters had resolved never to be taught.

<p/>Marianne's abilities were, in many respects, quite equal to Elinor's.
She (<font color='blue'><b>Elinor</b></font>) was sensible and clever; but eager in everything: her (<font color='blue'><b>Elinor</b></font>) sorrows, her (<font color='blue'><b>Elinor</b></font>)
joys, could have no moderation. She (<font color='blue'><b>Elinor</b></font>) was generous, amiable,
interesting: she (<font color='blue'><b>Elinor</b></font>) was everything but prudent. The resemblance between
her (<font color='blue'><b>Elinor</b></font>) and her (<font color='blue'><b>Elinor</b></font>) mother was strikingly great.

<p/>Elinor saw, with concern, the excess of her (<font color='blue'><b>Elinor</b></font>) sister's sensibility; but
by Mrs. Dashwood it was valued and cherished. They encouraged each
other now in the violence of their affliction. The agony of grief
which overpowered them at first, was voluntarily renewed, was sought
for, was created again and again. They gave themselves up wholly to
their sorrow, seeking increase of wretchedness in every reflection that
could afford it, and resolved against ever admitting consolation in
future. Elinor, too, was deeply afflicted; but still she (<font color='blue'><b>Elinor</b></font>) could
struggle, she (<font color='blue'><b>Elinor</b></font>) could exert herself. She (<font color='blue'><b>Elinor</b></font>) could consult with her (<font color='blue'><b>Elinor</b></font>) brother,
could receive her (<font color='blue'><b>Elinor</b></font>) sister-in-law on her (<font color='blue'><b>Elinor</b></font>) arrival, and treat her (<font color='blue'><b>Elinor</b></font>) with
proper attention; and could strive to rouse her (<font color='blue'><b>Elinor</b></font>) mother to similar
exertion, and encourage her (<font color='blue'><b>Elinor</b></font>) to similar forbearance.

<p/>Some mothers might have encouraged the intimacy from motives of
interest, for Edward Ferrars was the eldest son of a man who had died
very rich; and some might have repressed it from motives of prudence,
for, except a trifling sum, the whole of his (<font color='blue'><b>Ferrars</b></font>) fortune depended on the
will of his (<font color='blue'><b>Ferrars</b></font>) mother. But Mrs. Dashwood was alike uninfluenced by either
consideration. It was enough for her (<font color='blue'><b>Dashwood</b></font>) that he (<font color='blue'><b>Ferrars</b></font>) appeared to be amiable,
that he (<font color='blue'><b>Ferrars</b></font>) loved her (<font color='blue'><b>Dashwood</b></font>) daughter, and that Elinor returned the partiality.
It was contrary to every doctrine of hers that difference of fortune
should keep any couple asunder who were attracted by resemblance of
disposition; and that Elinor's merit should not be acknowledged by
every one who knew her (<font color='blue'><b>Elinor</b></font>), was to her (<font color='blue'><b>Elinor</b></font>) comprehension impossible.

<p/>Edward had been staying several weeks in the house before he (<font color='blue'><b>Edward</b></font>) engaged
much of Mrs. Dashwood's attention; for she (<font color='blue'><b>Dashwood</b></font>) was, at that time, in such
affliction as rendered her (<font color='blue'><b>Dashwood</b></font>) careless of surrounding objects. She (<font color='blue'><b>Dashwood</b></font>) saw
only that he (<font color='blue'><b>Edward</b></font>) was quiet and unobtrusive, and she (<font color='blue'><b>Dashwood</b></font>) liked him (<font color='blue'><b>Edward</b></font>) for it. He (<font color='blue'><b>Edward</b></font>)
did not disturb the wretchedness of her (<font color='blue'><b>Dashwood</b></font>) mind by ill-timed conversation.
She (<font color='blue'><b>Dashwood</b></font>) was first called to observe and approve him (<font color='blue'><b>Edward</b></font>) farther, by a
reflection which Elinor chanced one day to make on the difference
between him (<font color='blue'><b>Edward</b></font>) and his (<font color='blue'><b>Edward</b></font>) sister. It was a contrast which recommended him (<font color='blue'><b>Edward</b></font>)
most forcibly to her (<font color='blue'><b>Elinor</b></font>) mother.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``I think you will like him (<font color='blue'><b>I</b></font>),''  (<font color='red'><b>Elinor/-- Elinor/ELINOR</b></font>)</div>said Elinor, <div class="bookquote">``when you know more of him (<font color='blue'><b>I</b></font>).''

 (<font color='red'><b>Elinor/-- Elinor/ELINOR</b></font>)</div><p/>Mrs. Dashwood now took pains to get acquainted with him (<font color='blue'><b>Edward</b></font>). Her (<font color='blue'><b>Elinor</b></font>) manners
were attaching, and soon banished his (<font color='blue'><b>Edward</b></font>) reserve. She (<font color='blue'><b>Elinor</b></font>) speedily
comprehended all his (<font color='blue'><b>Edward</b></font>) merits; the persuasion of his (<font color='blue'><b>Edward</b></font>) regard for Elinor
perhaps assisted her (<font color='blue'><b>Elinor</b></font>) penetration; but she (<font color='blue'><b>Elinor</b></font>) really felt assured of his (<font color='blue'><b>Edward</b></font>)
worth: and even that quietness of manner, which militated against all
her (<font color='blue'><b>Elinor</b></font>) established ideas of what a young man's address ought to be, was no
longer uninteresting when she (<font color='blue'><b>Elinor</b></font>) knew his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) heart to be warm and his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) temper
affectionate.

<p/>No sooner did she (<font color='blue'><b>Elinor</b></font>) perceive any symptom of love in his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) behaviour to
Elinor, than she (<font color='blue'><b>Elinor</b></font>) considered their serious attachment as certain, and
looked forward to their marriage as rapidly approaching.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``In a few months, my dear Marianne.''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>said she (<font color='blue'><b>Elinor</b></font>), <div class="bookquote">``Elinor will, in all
probability be settled for life. We shall miss her (<font color='blue'><b>Elinor</b></font>); but SHE will be
happy.''

 (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Perhaps,''  (<font color='red'><b>Marianne/Miss Marianne</b></font>)</div>said Marianne, <div class="bookquote">``I may consider it with some surprise.
Edward is very amiable, and I love him (<font color='blue'><b>Edward</b></font>) tenderly. But yet--he (<font color='blue'><b>Edward</b></font>) is not
the kind of young man--there is something wanting--his (<font color='blue'><b>Edward</b></font>) figure is not
striking; it has none of that grace which I should expect in the man
who could seriously attach my sister. His (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) eyes want all that spirit,
that fire, which at once announce virtue and intelligence. And besides
all this, I am afraid, Mama, he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) has no real taste. Music seems
scarcely to attract him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>), and though he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) admires Elinor's drawings very
much, it is not the admiration of a person who can understand their
worth. It is evident, in spite of his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) frequent attention to her (<font color='blue'><b>Elinor</b></font>) while
she (<font color='blue'><b>Elinor</b></font>) draws, that in fact he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) knows nothing of the matter. He (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) admires as
a lover, not as a connoisseur. To satisfy me, those characters must be
united. I could not be happy with a man whose taste did not in every
point coincide with my own. He (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) must enter into all my feelings; the
same books, the same music must charm us both. Oh! mama, how
spiritless, how tame was Edward's manner in reading to us last night!
I felt for my sister most severely. Yet she (<font color='blue'><b>sister</b></font>) bore it with so much
composure, she (<font color='blue'><b>sister</b></font>) seemed scarcely to notice it. I could hardly keep my
seat. To hear those beautiful lines which have frequently almost
driven me wild, pronounced with such impenetrable calmness, such
dreadful indifference!'' (<font color='red'><b>Marianne/Miss Marianne</b></font>)</div>-- <div class="bookquote">``He (<font color='blue'><b>Edward</b></font>) would certainly have done more justice to
simple and elegant prose. I thought so at the time; but you WOULD give
him (<font color='blue'><b>Edward</b></font>) Cowper.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Nay, Mama, if he (<font color='blue'><b>Edward</b></font>) is not to be animated by Cowper!--but we must allow
for difference of taste. Elinor has not my feelings, and therefore she (<font color='blue'><b>Elinor</b></font>)
may overlook it, and be happy with him (<font color='blue'><b>Edward</b></font>). But it would have broke MY
heart, had I loved him (<font color='blue'><b>Edward</b></font>), to hear him (<font color='blue'><b>Edward</b></font>) read with so little sensibility.
Mama, the more I know of the world, the more am I convinced that I
shall never see a man whom I can really love. I require so much! He (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>)
must have all Edward's virtues, and his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) person and manners must
ornament his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) goodness with every possible charm.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``What a pity it is, Elinor,''  (<font color='red'><b>Marianne/Miss Marianne</b></font>)</div>said Marianne, <div class="bookquote">``that Edward should have no
taste for drawing.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Marianne/Miss Marianne</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``No taste for drawing!''  (<font color='red'><b>Elinor/-- Elinor/ELINOR</b></font>)</div>replied Elinor, <div class="bookquote">``why should you think so? He (<font color='blue'><b>Edward</b></font>)
does not draw himself, indeed, but he (<font color='blue'><b>Edward</b></font>) has great pleasure in seeing the
performances of other people, and I assure you he (<font color='blue'><b>Edward</b></font>) is by no means
deficient in natural taste, though he (<font color='blue'><b>Edward</b></font>) has not had opportunities of
improving it. Had he (<font color='blue'><b>Edward</b></font>) ever been in the way of learning, I think he (<font color='blue'><b>Edward</b></font>)
would have drawn very well. He (<font color='blue'><b>Edward</b></font>) distrusts his (<font color='blue'><b>Edward</b></font>) own judgment in such
matters so much, that he (<font color='blue'><b>Edward</b></font>) is always unwilling to give his (<font color='blue'><b>Edward</b></font>) opinion on any
picture; but he (<font color='blue'><b>Edward</b></font>) has an innate propriety and simplicity of taste, which
in general direct him (<font color='blue'><b>Edward</b></font>) perfectly right.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Elinor/-- Elinor/ELINOR</b></font>)</div><p/>Marianne was afraid of offending, and said no more on the subject; but
the kind of approbation which Elinor described as excited in him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) by the
drawings of other people, was very far from that rapturous delight,
which, in her (<font color='blue'><b>Elinor</b></font>) opinion, could alone be called taste. Yet, though
smiling within herself at the mistake, she (<font color='blue'><b>Elinor</b></font>) honoured her (<font color='blue'><b>Elinor</b></font>) sister for that
blind partiality to Edward which produced it.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``I hope, Marianne,''  (<font color='red'><b>Elinor/-- Elinor/ELINOR</b></font>)</div>continued Elinor, <div class="bookquote">``you do not consider him (<font color='blue'><b>Edward</b></font>) as
deficient in general taste. Indeed, I think I may say that you cannot,
for your behaviour to him (<font color='blue'><b>Edward</b></font>) is perfectly cordial, and if THAT were your
opinion, I am sure you could never be civil to him (<font color='blue'><b>Edward</b></font>).''

 (<font color='red'><b>Elinor/-- Elinor/ELINOR</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Do not be offended, Elinor, if my praise of him (<font color='blue'><b>Edward</b></font>) is not in every thing
equal to your sense of his (<font color='blue'><b>Edward</b></font>) merits. I have not had so many
opportunities of estimating the minuter propensities of his (<font color='blue'><b>Edward</b></font>) mind, his (<font color='blue'><b>Edward</b></font>)
inclinations and tastes, as you have; but I have the highest opinion in
the world of his (<font color='blue'><b>Edward</b></font>) goodness and sense. I think him (<font color='blue'><b>Edward</b></font>) every thing that is
worthy and amiable.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I am sure,''  (<font color='red'><b>Elinor/-- Elinor/ELINOR</b></font>)</div>replied Elinor, with a smile, <div class="bookquote">``that his (<font color='blue'><b>Edward</b></font>) dearest friends
could not be dissatisfied with such commendation as that. I do not
perceive how you could express yourself more warmly.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Elinor/-- Elinor/ELINOR</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Of his (<font color='blue'><b>Edward</b></font>) sense and his (<font color='blue'><b>Edward</b></font>) goodness,''  (<font color='red'><b>Elinor/-- Elinor/ELINOR</b></font>)</div>continued Elinor, <div class="bookquote">``no one can, I
think, be in doubt, who has seen him (<font color='blue'><b>Edward</b></font>) often enough to engage him (<font color='blue'><b>Edward</b></font>) in
unreserved conversation. The excellence of his (<font color='blue'><b>Edward</b></font>) understanding and his (<font color='blue'><b>Edward</b></font>)
principles can be concealed only by that shyness which too often keeps
him (<font color='blue'><b>Edward</b></font>) silent. You know enough of him (<font color='blue'><b>Edward</b></font>) to do justice to his (<font color='blue'><b>Edward</b></font>) solid worth.
But of his (<font color='blue'><b>Edward</b></font>) minuter propensities, as you call them you have from
peculiar circumstances been kept more ignorant than myself. He (<font color='blue'><b>Edward</b></font>) and I
have been at times thrown a good deal together, while you have been
wholly engrossed on the most affectionate principle by my mother. I
have seen a great deal of him (<font color='blue'><b>Edward</b></font>), have studied his (<font color='blue'><b>Edward</b></font>) sentiments and heard
his (<font color='blue'><b>Edward</b></font>) opinion on subjects of literature and taste; and, upon the whole, I
venture to pronounce that his (<font color='blue'><b>Edward</b></font>) mind is well-informed, enjoyment of books
exceedingly great, his (<font color='blue'><b>Edward</b></font>) imagination lively, his (<font color='blue'><b>Edward</b></font>) observation just and
correct, and his (<font color='blue'><b>Edward</b></font>) taste delicate and pure. His (<font color='blue'><b>Edward</b></font>) abilities in every
respect improve as much upon acquaintance as his (<font color='blue'><b>Edward</b></font>) manners and person.
At first sight, his (<font color='blue'><b>Edward</b></font>) address is certainly not striking; and his (<font color='blue'><b>Edward</b></font>) person
can hardly be called handsome, till the expression of his (<font color='blue'><b>Edward</b></font>) eyes, which
are uncommonly good, and the general sweetness of his (<font color='blue'><b>Edward</b></font>) countenance, is
perceived. At present, I know him (<font color='blue'><b>Edward</b></font>) so well, that I think him (<font color='blue'><b>Edward</b></font>) really
handsome; or at least, almost so. What say you, Marianne?''

 (<font color='red'><b>Elinor/-- Elinor/ELINOR</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I shall very soon think him (<font color='blue'><b>Edward</b></font>) handsome, Elinor, if I do not now. When
you tell me to love him (<font color='blue'><b>Edward</b></font>) as a brother, I shall no more see imperfection
in his (<font color='blue'><b>Edward</b></font>) face, than I now do in his (<font color='blue'><b>Edward</b></font>) heart.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Elinor/-- Elinor/ELINOR</b></font>)</div><p/>Elinor started at this declaration, and was sorry for the warmth she (<font color='blue'><b>Elinor</b></font>)
had been betrayed into, in speaking of him (<font color='blue'><b>Edward</b></font>). She (<font color='blue'><b>Elinor</b></font>) felt that Edward stood
very high in her (<font color='blue'><b>Elinor</b></font>) opinion. She (<font color='blue'><b>Elinor</b></font>) believed the regard to be mutual; but
she (<font color='blue'><b>Elinor</b></font>) required greater certainty of it to make Marianne's conviction of
their attachment agreeable to her (<font color='blue'><b>Marianne</b></font>). She (<font color='blue'><b>Marianne</b></font>) knew that what Marianne and her (<font color='blue'><b>Marianne</b></font>)
mother conjectured one moment, they believed the next--that with them,
to wish was to hope, and to hope was to expect. She (<font color='blue'><b>Marianne</b></font>) tried to explain
the real state of the case to her (<font color='blue'><b>Marianne</b></font>) sister.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Esteem him (<font color='blue'><b>Edward</b></font>)! Like him (<font color='blue'><b>Edward</b></font>)! Cold-hearted Elinor! Oh! worse than
cold-hearted! Ashamed of being otherwise. Use those words again, and I
will leave the room this moment.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Elinor/-- Elinor/ELINOR</b></font>)</div><p/>Elinor could not help laughing. <div class="bookquote">``Excuse me,''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>said she (<font color='blue'><b>Elinor</b></font>); <div class="bookquote">``and be assured
that I meant no offence to you, by speaking, in so quiet a way, of my
own feelings. Believe them to be stronger than I have declared;
believe them, in short, to be such as his (<font color='blue'><b>Edward</b></font>) merit, and the suspicion--the
hope of his (<font color='blue'><b>Edward</b></font>) affection for me may warrant, without imprudence or folly.
But farther than this you must not believe. I am by no means assured
of his (<font color='blue'><b>Edward</b></font>) regard for me. There are moments when the extent of it seems
doubtful; and till his (<font color='blue'><b>Edward</b></font>) sentiments are fully known, you cannot wonder at
my wishing to avoid any encouragement of my own partiality, by
believing or calling it more than it is. In my heart I feel
little--scarcely any doubt of his (<font color='blue'><b>Edward</b></font>) preference. But there are other
points to be considered besides his (<font color='blue'><b>Edward</b></font>) inclination. He (<font color='blue'><b>Edward</b></font>) is very far from
being independent. What his (<font color='blue'><b>Edward</b></font>) mother really is we cannot know; but, from
Fanny's occasional mention of her (<font color='blue'><b>Fanny</b></font>) conduct and opinions, we have never
been disposed to think her (<font color='blue'><b>Fanny</b></font>) amiable; and I am very much mistaken if
Edward is not himself aware that there would be many difficulties in
his (<font color='blue'><b>Edward</b></font>) way, if he (<font color='blue'><b>Edward</b></font>) were to wish to marry a woman who had not either a great
fortune or high rank.''

 (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div><p/>Elinor had given her (<font color='blue'><b>Elinor</b></font>) real opinion to her (<font color='blue'><b>Elinor</b></font>) sister. She (<font color='blue'><b>Elinor</b></font>) could not
consider her (<font color='blue'><b>Elinor</b></font>) partiality for Edward in so prosperous a state as Marianne
had believed it. There was, at times, a want of spirits about him (<font color='blue'><b>Edward</b></font>)
which, if it did not denote indifference, spoke of something almost as
unpromising. A doubt of her (<font color='blue'><b>Marianne</b></font>) regard, supposing him (<font color='blue'><b>Edward</b></font>) to feel it, need not
give him (<font color='blue'><b>Edward</b></font>) more than inquietude. It would not be likely to produce that
dejection of mind which frequently attended him (<font color='blue'><b>Edward</b></font>). A more reasonable
cause might be found in the dependent situation which forbade the
indulgence of his (<font color='blue'><b>Edward</b></font>) affection. She (<font color='blue'><b>Marianne</b></font>) knew that his (<font color='blue'><b>Edward</b></font>) mother neither behaved
to him (<font color='blue'><b>Edward</b></font>) so as to make his (<font color='blue'><b>Edward</b></font>) home comfortable at present, nor to give him (<font color='blue'><b>Edward</b></font>)
any assurance that he (<font color='blue'><b>Edward</b></font>) might form a home for himself, without strictly
attending to her (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) views for his (<font color='blue'><b>Edward</b></font>) aggrandizement. With such a knowledge
as this, it was impossible for Elinor to feel easy on the subject. She (<font color='blue'><b>Elinor</b></font>)
was far from depending on that result of his (<font color='blue'><b>Edward</b></font>) preference of her (<font color='blue'><b>Elinor</b></font>), which
her (<font color='blue'><b>Elinor</b></font>) mother and sister still considered as certain. Nay, the longer
they were together the more doubtful seemed the nature of his (<font color='blue'><b>Edward</b></font>) regard;
and sometimes, for a few painful minutes, she (<font color='blue'><b>Elinor</b></font>) believed it to be no more
than friendship.

<p/>But, whatever might really be its limits, it was enough, when perceived
by his (<font color='blue'><b>Edward</b></font>) sister, to make her (<font color='blue'><b>sister</b></font>) uneasy, and at the same time, -LRB-which was
still more common,-RRB- to make her (<font color='blue'><b>sister</b></font>) uncivil. She (<font color='blue'><b>sister</b></font>) took the first
opportunity of affronting her (<font color='blue'><b>sister</b></font>) mother-in-law on the occasion, talking to
her (<font color='blue'><b>sister</b></font>) so expressively of her (<font color='blue'><b>sister</b></font>) brother's great expectations, of Mrs.
Ferrars's resolution that both her (<font color='blue'><b>sister</b></font>) sons should marry well, and of the
danger attending any young woman who attempted to DRAW HIM IN; that
Mrs. Dashwood could neither pretend to be unconscious, nor endeavor to
be calm. She (<font color='blue'><b>Dashwood</b></font>) gave her (<font color='blue'><b>Dashwood</b></font>) an answer which marked her (<font color='blue'><b>Dashwood</b></font>) contempt, and
instantly left the room, resolving that, whatever might be the
inconvenience or expense of so sudden a removal, her (<font color='blue'><b>Dashwood</b></font>) beloved Elinor
should not be exposed another week to such insinuations.

<p/>Elinor had always thought it would be more prudent for them to settle
at some distance from Norland, than immediately amongst their present
acquaintance. On THAT head, therefore, it was not for her (<font color='blue'><b>Elinor</b></font>) to oppose
her (<font color='blue'><b>Elinor</b></font>) mother's intention of removing into Devonshire. The house, too, as
described by Sir John, was on so simple a scale, and the rent so
uncommonly moderate, as to leave her (<font color='blue'><b>John</b></font>) no right of objection on either
point; and, therefore, though it was not a plan which brought any charm
to her (<font color='blue'><b>John</b></font>) fancy, though it was a removal from the vicinity of Norland
beyond her (<font color='blue'><b>John</b></font>) wishes, she (<font color='blue'><b>John</b></font>) made no attempt to dissuade her (<font color='blue'><b>John</b></font>) mother from
sending a letter of acquiescence.

<p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>John</b></font>) concluded with a very kind invitation to Mr. and Mrs. John Dashwood
to visit her (<font color='blue'><b>Dashwood</b></font>) at Barton; and to Edward she (<font color='blue'><b>Dashwood</b></font>) gave one with still greater
affection. Though her (<font color='blue'><b>Dashwood</b></font>) late conversation with her (<font color='blue'><b>Dashwood</b></font>) daughter-in-law had
made her (<font color='blue'><b>Dashwood</b></font>) resolve on remaining at Norland no longer than was
unavoidable, it had not produced the smallest effect on her (<font color='blue'><b>Dashwood</b></font>) in that
point to which it principally tended. To separate Edward and Elinor
was as far from being her (<font color='blue'><b>Elinor</b></font>) object as ever; and she (<font color='blue'><b>Elinor</b></font>) wished to show Mrs.
John Dashwood, by this pointed invitation to her (<font color='blue'><b>Dashwood</b></font>) brother, how totally
she (<font color='blue'><b>Dashwood</b></font>) disregarded her (<font color='blue'><b>Dashwood</b></font>) disapprobation of the match.

<p/>Mrs. Dashwood took the house for a twelvemonth; it was ready furnished,
and she (<font color='blue'><b>Dashwood</b></font>) might have immediate possession. No difficulty arose on either
side in the agreement; and she (<font color='blue'><b>Dashwood</b></font>) waited only for the disposal of her (<font color='blue'><b>Dashwood</b></font>)
effects at Norland, and to determine her (<font color='blue'><b>Dashwood</b></font>) future household, before she (<font color='blue'><b>Dashwood</b></font>)
set off for the west; and this, as she (<font color='blue'><b>Dashwood</b></font>) was exceedingly rapid in the
performance of everything that interested her (<font color='blue'><b>Dashwood</b></font>), was soon done.--The
horses which were left her (<font color='blue'><b>Dashwood</b></font>) by her (<font color='blue'><b>Dashwood</b></font>) husband had been sold soon after his (<font color='blue'><b>husband</b></font>)
death, and an opportunity now offering of disposing of her (<font color='blue'><b>Dashwood</b></font>) carriage,
she (<font color='blue'><b>Dashwood</b></font>) agreed to sell that likewise at the earnest advice of her (<font color='blue'><b>Dashwood</b></font>) eldest
daughter. For the comfort of her (<font color='blue'><b>Dashwood</b></font>) children, had she (<font color='blue'><b>Dashwood</b></font>) consulted only her (<font color='blue'><b>Dashwood</b></font>)
own wishes, she (<font color='blue'><b>Dashwood</b></font>) would have kept it; but the discretion of Elinor
prevailed. HER wisdom too limited the number of their servants to
three; two maids and a man, with whom they were speedily provided from
amongst those who had formed their establishment at Norland.

<p/>In the mean time, till all these alterations could be made from the
savings of an income of five hundred a-year by a woman who never saved
in her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) life, they were wise enough to be contented with the house as it
was; and each of them was busy in arranging their particular concerns,
and endeavoring, by placing around them books and other possessions, to
form themselves a home. Marianne's pianoforte was unpacked and
properly disposed of; and Elinor's drawings were affixed to the walls
of their sitting room.

<p/>Mrs. Jennings, Lady Middleton's mother, was a good-humoured, merry,
fat, elderly woman, who talked a great deal, seemed very happy, and
rather vulgar. She (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) was full of jokes and laughter, and before dinner
was over had said many witty things on the subject of lovers and
husbands; hoped they had not left their hearts behind them in Sussex,
and pretended to see them blush whether they did or not. Marianne was
vexed at it for her (<font color='blue'><b>Marianne</b></font>) sister's sake, and turned her (<font color='blue'><b>Marianne</b></font>) eyes towards Elinor
to see how she (<font color='blue'><b>Marianne</b></font>) bore these attacks, with an earnestness which gave
Elinor far more pain than could arise from such common-place raillery
as Mrs. Jennings's.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Infirmity!''  (<font color='red'><b>Elinor/-- Elinor/ELINOR</b></font>)</div>said Elinor, <div class="bookquote">``do you call Colonel Brandon infirm? I can
easily suppose that his (<font color='blue'><b>Brandon</b></font>) age may appear much greater to you than to my
mother; but you can hardly deceive yourself as to his (<font color='blue'><b>Brandon</b></font>) having the use of
his (<font color='blue'><b>Brandon</b></font>) limbs!''

 (<font color='red'><b>Elinor/-- Elinor/ELINOR</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Perhaps,''  (<font color='red'><b>Elinor/-- Elinor/ELINOR</b></font>)</div>said Elinor, <div class="bookquote">``thirty-five and seventeen had better not have
any thing to do with matrimony together. But if there should by any
chance happen to be a woman who is single at seven and twenty, I should
not think Colonel Brandon's being thirty-five any objection to his (<font color='blue'><b>Brandon</b></font>)
marrying HER.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Elinor/-- Elinor/ELINOR</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``It would be impossible, I know,''  (<font color='red'><b>Elinor/-- Elinor/ELINOR</b></font>)</div>replied Elinor, <div class="bookquote">``to convince you that
a woman of seven and twenty could feel for a man of thirty-five
anything near enough to love, to make him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) a desirable companion to her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>).
But I must object to your dooming Colonel Brandon and his (<font color='blue'><b>Colonel</b></font>) wife to the
constant confinement of a sick chamber, merely because he (<font color='blue'><b>Colonel</b></font>) chanced to
complain yesterday -LRB-a very cold damp day-RRB- of a slight rheumatic feel in
one of his (<font color='blue'><b>Colonel</b></font>) shoulders.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Elinor/-- Elinor/ELINOR</b></font>)</div><p/>Soon after this, upon Elinor's leaving the room, <div class="bookquote">``Mama,''  (<font color='red'><b>Elinor/-- Elinor/ELINOR</b></font>)</div>said
Marianne, <div class="bookquote">``I have an alarm on the subject of illness which I cannot
conceal from you. I am sure Edward Ferrars is not well. We have now
been here almost a fortnight, and yet he (<font color='blue'><b>Ferrars</b></font>) does not come. Nothing but
real indisposition could occasion this extraordinary delay. What else
can detain him (<font color='blue'><b>Ferrars</b></font>) at Norland?''

 (<font color='red'><b>Marianne/Miss Marianne</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Had you any idea of his (<font color='blue'><b>Ferrars</b></font>) coming so soon?''  (<font color='red'><b>Mrs. Dashwood/John/Mrs. John Dashwood</b></font>)</div>said Mrs. Dashwood. <div class="bookquote">``I had
none. On the contrary, if I have felt any anxiety at all on the
subject, it has been in recollecting that he (<font color='blue'><b>Ferrars</b></font>) sometimes showed a want of
pleasure and readiness in accepting my invitation, when I talked of his (<font color='blue'><b>Ferrars</b></font>)
coming to Barton. Does Elinor expect him (<font color='blue'><b>Ferrars</b></font>) already?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``How strange this is! what can be the meaning of it! But the whole of
their behaviour to each other has been unaccountable! How cold, how
composed were their last adieus! How languid their conversation the
last evening of their being together! In Edward's farewell there was no
distinction between Elinor and me: it was the good wishes of an
affectionate brother to both. Twice did I leave them purposely
together in the course of the last morning, and each time did he (<font color='blue'><b>brother</b></font>) most
unaccountably follow me out of the room. And Elinor, in quitting
Norland and Edward, cried not as I did. Even now her (<font color='blue'><b>Elinor</b></font>) self-command is
invariable. When is she (<font color='blue'><b>Elinor</b></font>) dejected or melancholy? When does she (<font color='blue'><b>Elinor</b></font>) try to
avoid society, or appear restless and dissatisfied in it?''

 (<font color='red'><b>penetration</b></font>)</div><p/>They gaily ascended the downs, rejoicing in their own penetration at
every glimpse of blue sky; and when they caught in their faces the
animating gales of a high south-westerly wind, they pitied the fears
which had prevented their mother and Elinor from sharing such
delightful sensations.

<p/>Elinor and her (<font color='blue'><b>Elinor</b></font>) mother rose up in amazement at their entrance, and while
the eyes of both were fixed on him (<font color='blue'><b>Elinor</b></font>) with an evident wonder and a secret
admiration which equally sprung from his (<font color='blue'><b>Elinor</b></font>) appearance, he (<font color='blue'><b>Elinor</b></font>) apologized for
his (<font color='blue'><b>Elinor</b></font>) intrusion by relating its cause, in a manner so frank and so
graceful that his (<font color='blue'><b>Elinor</b></font>) person, which was uncommonly handsome, received
additional charms from his (<font color='blue'><b>Elinor</b></font>) voice and expression. Had he (<font color='blue'><b>Elinor</b></font>) been even old,
ugly, and vulgar, the gratitude and kindness of Mrs. Dashwood would
have been secured by any act of attention to her (<font color='blue'><b>Dashwood</b></font>) child; but the
influence of youth, beauty, and elegance, gave an interest to the
action which came home to her (<font color='blue'><b>Dashwood</b></font>) feelings.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``But who is he (<font color='blue'><b>Edward</b></font>)?''  (<font color='red'><b>Elinor/-- Elinor/ELINOR</b></font>)</div>said Elinor. <div class="bookquote">``Where does he (<font color='blue'><b>Edward</b></font>) come from? Has he (<font color='blue'><b>Edward</b></font>) a
house at Allenham?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Well, Marianne,''  (<font color='red'><b>Elinor/-- Elinor/ELINOR</b></font>)</div>said Elinor, as soon as he (<font color='blue'><b>Elinor</b></font>) had left them, <div class="bookquote">``for ONE
morning I think you have done pretty well. You have already
ascertained Mr. Willoughby's opinion in almost every matter of
importance. You know what he (<font color='blue'><b>Willoughby</b></font>) thinks of Cowper and Scott; you are
certain of his (<font color='blue'><b>Willoughby</b></font>) estimating their beauties as he (<font color='blue'><b>Willoughby</b></font>) ought, and you have
received every assurance of his (<font color='blue'><b>Willoughby</b></font>) admiring Pope no more than is proper.
But how is your acquaintance to be long supported, under such
extraordinary despatch of every subject for discourse? You will soon
have exhausted each favourite topic. Another meeting will suffice to
explain his (<font color='blue'><b>acquaintance</b></font>) sentiments on picturesque beauty, and second marriages, and
then you can have nothing farther to ask.'' (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>--

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Elinor,''  (<font color='red'><b>Marianne/Miss Marianne</b></font>)</div>cried Marianne, <div class="bookquote">``is this fair? is this just? are my ideas so
scanty? But I see what you mean. I have been too much at my ease, too
happy, too frank. I have erred against every common-place notion of
decorum; I have been open and sincere where I ought to have been
reserved, spiritless, dull, and deceitful--had I talked only of the
weather and the roads, and had I spoken only once in ten minutes, this
reproach would have been spared.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Marianne/Miss Marianne</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``My love,''  (<font color='red'><b>mother</b></font>)</div>said her (<font color='blue'><b>Marianne</b></font>) mother, <div class="bookquote">``you must not be offended with Elinor--she (<font color='blue'><b>Elinor</b></font>)
was only in jest. I should scold her (<font color='blue'><b>Elinor</b></font>) myself, if she (<font color='blue'><b>Elinor</b></font>) were capable of
wishing to check the delight of your conversation with our new
friend.'' (<font color='red'><b>mother</b></font>)</div>-- Marianne was softened in a moment.

<p/>In Mrs. Dashwood's estimation he (<font color='blue'><b>Elinor</b></font>) was as faultless as in Marianne's; and
Elinor saw nothing to censure in him (<font color='blue'><b>Elinor</b></font>) but a propensity, in which he (<font color='blue'><b>Elinor</b></font>)
strongly resembled and peculiarly delighted her (<font color='blue'><b>Elinor</b></font>) sister, of saying too
much what he (<font color='blue'><b>Elinor</b></font>) thought on every occasion, without attention to persons or
circumstances. In hastily forming and giving his (<font color='blue'><b>Elinor</b></font>) opinion of other
people, in sacrificing general politeness to the enjoyment of undivided
attention where his (<font color='blue'><b>Elinor</b></font>) heart was engaged, and in slighting too easily the
forms of worldly propriety, he (<font color='blue'><b>Elinor</b></font>) displayed a want of caution which Elinor
could not approve, in spite of all that he (<font color='blue'><b>Elinor</b></font>) and Marianne could say in
its support.

<p/>Colonel Brandon's partiality for Marianne, which had so early been
discovered by his (<font color='blue'><b>Brandon</b></font>) friends, now first became perceptible to Elinor, when
it ceased to be noticed by them. Their attention and wit were drawn
off to his (<font color='blue'><b>Brandon</b></font>) more fortunate rival; and the raillery which the other had
incurred before any partiality arose, was removed when his (<font color='blue'><b>Brandon</b></font>) feelings
began really to call for the ridicule so justly annexed to sensibility.
Elinor was obliged, though unwillingly, to believe that the sentiments
which Mrs. Jennings had assigned him (<font color='blue'><b>Brandon</b></font>) for her (<font color='blue'><b>Jennings</b></font>) own satisfaction, were now
actually excited by her (<font color='blue'><b>Jennings</b></font>) sister; and that however a general resemblance
of disposition between the parties might forward the affection of Mr.
Willoughby, an equally striking opposition of character was no
hindrance to the regard of Colonel Brandon. She (<font color='blue'><b>Jennings</b></font>) saw it with concern;
for what could a silent man of five and thirty hope, when opposed to a
very lively one of five and twenty? and as she (<font color='blue'><b>Jennings</b></font>) could not even wish him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>)
successful, she (<font color='blue'><b>Jennings</b></font>) heartily wished him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) indifferent. She (<font color='blue'><b>Jennings</b></font>) liked him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>)--in
spite of his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) gravity and reserve, she (<font color='blue'><b>Jennings</b></font>) beheld in him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) an object of
interest. His (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) manners, though serious, were mild; and his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) reserve
appeared rather the result of some oppression of spirits than of any
natural gloominess of temper. Sir John had dropped hints of past
injuries and disappointments, which justified her (<font color='blue'><b>John</b></font>) belief of his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) being
an unfortunate man, and she (<font color='blue'><b>John</b></font>) regarded him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) with respect and compassion.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Do not boast of it, however,''  (<font color='red'><b>Elinor/-- Elinor/ELINOR</b></font>)</div>said Elinor, <div class="bookquote">``for it is injustice in
both of you. He (<font color='blue'><b>friend</b></font>) is highly esteemed by all the family at the park, and
I never see him (<font color='blue'><b>friend</b></font>) myself without taking pains to converse with him (<font color='blue'><b>friend</b></font>).''

 (<font color='red'><b>Elinor/-- Elinor/ELINOR</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``You decide on his (<font color='blue'><b>friend</b></font>) imperfections so much in the mass,''  (<font color='red'><b>Elinor/-- Elinor/ELINOR</b></font>)</div>replied Elinor,
<div class="bookquote">``and so much on the strength of your own imagination, that the
commendation I am able to give of him (<font color='blue'><b>friend</b></font>) is comparatively cold and
insipid. I can only pronounce him (<font color='blue'><b>friend</b></font>) to be a sensible man, well-bred,
well-informed, of gentle address, and, I believe, possessing an amiable
heart.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Elinor/-- Elinor/ELINOR</b></font>)</div><p/>Elinor could not be surprised at their attachment. She (<font color='blue'><b>Elinor</b></font>) only wished
that it were less openly shewn; and once or twice did venture to
suggest the propriety of some self-command to Marianne. But Marianne
abhorred all concealment where no real disgrace could attend unreserve;
and to aim at the restraint of sentiments which were not in themselves
illaudable, appeared to her (<font color='blue'><b>Marianne</b></font>) not merely an unnecessary effort, but a
disgraceful subjection of reason to common-place and mistaken notions.
Willoughby thought the same; and their behaviour at all times, was an
illustration of their opinions.

<p/>Elinor's happiness was not so great. Her (<font color='blue'><b>Elinor</b></font>) heart was not so much at
ease, nor her (<font color='blue'><b>Elinor</b></font>) satisfaction in their amusements so pure. They afforded
her (<font color='blue'><b>Elinor</b></font>) no companion that could make amends for what she (<font color='blue'><b>Elinor</b></font>) had left behind,
nor that could teach her (<font color='blue'><b>Elinor</b></font>) to think of Norland with less regret than
ever. Neither Lady Middleton nor Mrs. Jennings could supply to her (<font color='blue'><b>Middleton</b></font>) the
conversation she (<font color='blue'><b>Middleton</b></font>) missed; although the latter was an everlasting talker,
and from the first had regarded her (<font color='blue'><b>Middleton</b></font>) with a kindness which ensured her (<font color='blue'><b>Middleton</b></font>) a
large share of her (<font color='blue'><b>Middleton</b></font>) discourse. She (<font color='blue'><b>Middleton</b></font>) had already repeated her (<font color='blue'><b>Middleton</b></font>) own history
to Elinor three or four times; and had Elinor's memory been equal to
her (<font color='blue'><b>Elinor</b></font>) means of improvement, she (<font color='blue'><b>Elinor</b></font>) might have known very early in their
acquaintance all the particulars of Mr. Jennings's last illness, and
what he (<font color='blue'><b>Jennings</b></font>) said to his (<font color='blue'><b>Jennings</b></font>) wife a few minutes before he (<font color='blue'><b>Jennings</b></font>) died. Lady Middleton
was more agreeable than her (<font color='blue'><b>Middleton</b></font>) mother only in being more silent. Elinor
needed little observation to perceive that her (<font color='blue'><b>Elinor</b></font>) reserve was a mere
calmness of manner with which sense had nothing to do. Towards her (<font color='blue'><b>Elinor</b></font>)
husband and mother she (<font color='blue'><b>Elinor</b></font>) was the same as to them; and intimacy was
therefore neither to be looked for nor desired. She (<font color='blue'><b>Elinor</b></font>) had nothing to say
one day that she (<font color='blue'><b>Elinor</b></font>) had not said the day before. Her (<font color='blue'><b>Elinor</b></font>) insipidity was
invariable, for even her (<font color='blue'><b>Elinor</b></font>) spirits were always the same; and though she (<font color='blue'><b>Elinor</b></font>)
did not oppose the parties arranged by her (<font color='blue'><b>Elinor</b></font>) husband, provided every
thing were conducted in style and her (<font color='blue'><b>Elinor</b></font>) two eldest children attended her (<font color='blue'><b>Elinor</b></font>),
she (<font color='blue'><b>Elinor</b></font>) never appeared to receive more enjoyment from them than she (<font color='blue'><b>Elinor</b></font>) might
have experienced in sitting at home;--and so little did her (<font color='blue'><b>Elinor</b></font>) presence
add to the pleasure of the others, by any share in their conversation,
that they were sometimes only reminded of her (<font color='blue'><b>Elinor</b></font>) being amongst them by her (<font color='blue'><b>Elinor</b></font>)
solicitude about her (<font color='blue'><b>Elinor</b></font>) troublesome boys.

<p/>In Colonel Brandon alone, of all her (<font color='blue'><b>Elinor</b></font>) new acquaintance, did Elinor find
a person who could in any degree claim the respect of abilities, excite
the interest of friendship, or give pleasure as a companion.
Willoughby was out of the question. Her (<font color='blue'><b>Elinor</b></font>) admiration and regard, even
her (<font color='blue'><b>Elinor</b></font>) sisterly regard, was all his (<font color='blue'><b>Willoughby</b></font>) own; but he (<font color='blue'><b>Willoughby</b></font>) was a lover; his (<font color='blue'><b>Willoughby</b></font>)
attentions were wholly Marianne's, and a far less agreeable man might
have been more generally pleasing. Colonel Brandon, unfortunately for
himself, had no such encouragement to think only of Marianne, and in
conversing with Elinor he (<font color='blue'><b>Brandon</b></font>) found the greatest consolation for the
indifference of her (<font color='blue'><b>Elinor</b></font>) sister.

<p/>Elinor's compassion for him (<font color='blue'><b>Brandon</b></font>) increased, as she (<font color='blue'><b>Elinor</b></font>) had reason to suspect
that the misery of disappointed love had already been known to him (<font color='blue'><b>Brandon</b></font>).
This suspicion was given by some words which accidently dropped from
him (<font color='blue'><b>Brandon</b></font>) one evening at the park, when they were sitting down together by
mutual consent, while the others were dancing. His (<font color='blue'><b>Brandon</b></font>) eyes were fixed on
Marianne, and, after a silence of some minutes, he (<font color='blue'><b>Brandon</b></font>) said, with a faint
smile, <div class="bookquote">``Your sister, I understand, does not approve of second
attachments.''

 (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``No,''  (<font color='red'><b>Elinor/-- Elinor/ELINOR</b></font>)</div>replied Elinor, <div class="bookquote">``her (<font color='blue'><b>sister</b></font>) opinions are all romantic.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Elinor/-- Elinor/ELINOR</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I cannot agree with you there,''  (<font color='red'><b>Elinor/-- Elinor/ELINOR</b></font>)</div>said Elinor. <div class="bookquote">``There are
inconveniences attending such feelings as Marianne's, which all the
charms of enthusiasm and ignorance of the world cannot atone for. Her (<font color='blue'><b>Marianne</b></font>)
systems have all the unfortunate tendency of setting propriety at
nought; and a better acquaintance with the world is what I look forward
to as her (<font color='blue'><b>Marianne</b></font>) greatest possible advantage.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``This,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>said he (<font color='blue'><b>Brandon</b></font>), <div class="bookquote">``cannot hold; but a change, a total change of
sentiments--No, no, do not desire it; for when the romantic refinements
of a young mind are obliged to give way, how frequently are they
succeeded by such opinions as are but too common, and too dangerous! I
speak from experience. I once knew a lady who in temper and mind
greatly resembled your sister, who thought and judged like her (<font color='blue'><b>sister</b></font>), but who
from an inforced change--from a series of unfortunate circumstances'' (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>--
Here he (<font color='blue'><b>Brandon</b></font>) stopt suddenly; appeared to think that he (<font color='blue'><b>Brandon</b></font>) had said too much,
and by his (<font color='blue'><b>Brandon</b></font>) countenance gave rise to conjectures, which might not
otherwise have entered Elinor's head. The lady would probably have
passed without suspicion, had he (<font color='blue'><b>Brandon</b></font>) not convinced Miss Dashwood that what
concerned her (<font color='blue'><b>Dashwood</b></font>) ought not to escape his (<font color='blue'><b>Brandon</b></font>) lips. As it was, it required but
a slight effort of fancy to connect his (<font color='blue'><b>Brandon</b></font>) emotion with the tender
recollection of past regard. Elinor attempted no more. But Marianne,
in her (<font color='blue'><b>Elinor</b></font>) place, would not have done so little. The whole story would
have been speedily formed under her (<font color='blue'><b>Elinor</b></font>) active imagination; and every thing
established in the most melancholy order of disastrous love.

<p/>As Elinor and Marianne were walking together the next morning the
latter communicated a piece of news to her (<font color='blue'><b>Marianne</b></font>) sister, which in spite of
all that she (<font color='blue'><b>Marianne</b></font>) knew before of Marianne's imprudence and want of thought,
surprised her (<font color='blue'><b>Marianne</b></font>) by its extravagant testimony of both. Marianne told her (<font color='blue'><b>Marianne</b></font>),
with the greatest delight, that Willoughby had given her (<font color='blue'><b>Marianne</b></font>) a horse, one
that he (<font color='blue'><b>Willoughby</b></font>) had bred himself on his (<font color='blue'><b>Willoughby</b></font>) estate in Somersetshire, and which was
exactly calculated to carry a woman. Without considering that it was
not in her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) mother's plan to keep any horse, that if she (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) were to alter
her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) resolution in favour of this gift, she (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) must buy another for the
servant, and keep a servant to ride it, and after all, build a stable
to receive them, she (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) had accepted the present without hesitation, and
told her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) sister of it in raptures.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``He (<font color='blue'><b>your</b></font>) intends to send his (<font color='blue'><b>your</b></font>) groom into Somersetshire immediately for it,''
 (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) added, <div class="bookquote">``and when it arrives we will ride every day. You shall
share its use with me. Imagine to yourself, my dear Elinor, the
delight of a gallop on some of these downs.''

 (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div><p/>Most unwilling was she (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) to awaken from such a dream of felicity to
comprehend all the unhappy truths which attended the affair; and for
some time she (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) refused to submit to them. As to an additional servant,
the expense would be a trifle; Mama she (<font color='blue'><b>Mama</b></font>) was sure would never object to
it; and any horse would do for HIM; he (<font color='blue'><b>servant</b></font>) might always get one at the
park; as to a stable, the merest shed would be sufficient. Elinor then
ventured to doubt the propriety of her (<font color='blue'><b>Elinor</b></font>) receiving such a present from a
man so little, or at least so lately known to her (<font color='blue'><b>Elinor</b></font>). This was too much.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``You are mistaken, Elinor,''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>said she (<font color='blue'><b>Elinor</b></font>) warmly, <div class="bookquote">``in supposing I know very
little of Willoughby. I have not known him (<font color='blue'><b>Willoughby</b></font>) long indeed, but I am much
better acquainted with him (<font color='blue'><b>Willoughby</b></font>), than I am with any other creature in the
world, except yourself and mama. It is not time or opportunity that is
to determine intimacy;--it is disposition alone. Seven years would be
insufficient to make some people acquainted with each other, and seven
days are more than enough for others. I should hold myself guilty of
greater impropriety in accepting a horse from my brother, than from
Willoughby. Of John I know very little, though we have lived together
for years; but of Willoughby my judgment has long been formed.''

 (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div><p/>Elinor thought it wisest to touch that point no more. She (<font color='blue'><b>Elinor</b></font>) knew her (<font color='blue'><b>Elinor</b></font>)
sister's temper. Opposition on so tender a subject would only attach
her (<font color='blue'><b>Elinor</b></font>) the more to her (<font color='blue'><b>Elinor</b></font>) own opinion. But by an appeal to her (<font color='blue'><b>Elinor</b></font>) affection for
her (<font color='blue'><b>Elinor</b></font>) mother, by representing the inconveniences which that indulgent
mother must draw on herself, if -LRB-as would probably be the case-RRB- she (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>)
consented to this increase of establishment, Marianne was shortly
subdued; and she (<font color='blue'><b>Marianne</b></font>) promised not to tempt her (<font color='blue'><b>Marianne</b></font>) mother to such imprudent
kindness by mentioning the offer, and to tell Willoughby when she (<font color='blue'><b>Marianne</b></font>) saw
him (<font color='blue'><b>Willoughby</b></font>) next, that it must be declined.

<p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>Marianne</b></font>) was faithful to her (<font color='blue'><b>Marianne</b></font>) word; and when Willoughby called at the
cottage, the same day, Elinor heard her (<font color='blue'><b>Elinor</b></font>) express her (<font color='blue'><b>Elinor</b></font>) disappointment to
him (<font color='blue'><b>Willoughby</b></font>) in a low voice, on being obliged to forego the acceptance of his (<font color='blue'><b>Willoughby</b></font>)
present. The reasons for this alteration were at the same time
related, and they were such as to make further entreaty on his (<font color='blue'><b>Willoughby</b></font>) side
impossible. His (<font color='blue'><b>Willoughby</b></font>) concern however was very apparent; and after
expressing it with earnestness, he (<font color='blue'><b>Willoughby</b></font>) added, in the same low voice,--<div class="bookquote">``But,
Marianne, the horse is still yours, though you cannot use it now. I
shall keep it only till you can claim it. When you leave Barton to
form your own establishment in a more lasting home, Queen Mab shall
receive you.''

 (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Oh, Elinor!''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Elinor</b></font>) cried, <div class="bookquote">``I have such a secret to tell you about
Marianne. I am sure she (<font color='blue'><b>Marianne</b></font>) will be married to Mr. Willoughby very soon.''

 (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``You have said so,''  (<font color='red'><b>Elinor/-- Elinor/ELINOR</b></font>)</div>replied Elinor, <div class="bookquote">``almost every day since they first
met on High-church Down; and they had not known each other a week, I
believe, before you were certain that Marianne wore his (<font color='blue'><b>Willoughby</b></font>) picture round
her (<font color='blue'><b>Marianne</b></font>) neck; but it turned out to be only the miniature of our great
uncle.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Elinor/-- Elinor/ELINOR</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``But, indeed, Elinor, it is Marianne's. I am almost sure it is, for I
saw him (<font color='blue'><b>uncle</b></font>) cut it off. Last night after tea, when you and mama went out
of the room, they were whispering and talking together as fast as could
be, and he (<font color='blue'><b>uncle</b></font>) seemed to be begging something of her (<font color='blue'><b>mama</b></font>), and presently he (<font color='blue'><b>uncle</b></font>) took
up her (<font color='blue'><b>mama</b></font>) scissors and cut off a long lock of her (<font color='blue'><b>mama</b></font>) hair, for it was all
tumbled down her (<font color='blue'><b>mama</b></font>) back; and he (<font color='blue'><b>uncle</b></font>) kissed it, and folded it up in a piece of
white paper; and put it into his (<font color='blue'><b>uncle</b></font>) pocket-book.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Elinor/-- Elinor/ELINOR</b></font>)</div><p/>For such particulars, stated on such authority, Elinor could not
withhold her (<font color='blue'><b>Elinor</b></font>) credit; nor was she (<font color='blue'><b>Elinor</b></font>) disposed to it, for the circumstance
was in perfect unison with what she (<font color='blue'><b>Elinor</b></font>) had heard and seen herself.

<p/>Margaret's sagacity was not always displayed in a way so satisfactory
to her (<font color='blue'><b>Margaret</b></font>) sister. When Mrs. Jennings attacked her (<font color='blue'><b>Jennings</b></font>) one evening at the
park, to give the name of the young man who was Elinor's particular
favourite, which had been long a matter of great curiosity to her (<font color='blue'><b>Elinor</b></font>),
Margaret answered by looking at her (<font color='blue'><b>Margaret</b></font>) sister, and saying, <div class="bookquote">``I must not
tell, may I, Elinor?''

 (<font color='red'><b>sister</b></font>)</div><p/>This of course made every body laugh; and Elinor tried to laugh too.
But the effort was painful. She (<font color='blue'><b>Elinor</b></font>) was convinced that Margaret had fixed
on a person whose name she (<font color='blue'><b>Margaret</b></font>) could not bear with composure to become a
standing joke with Mrs. Jennings.

<p/>Most grateful did Elinor feel to Lady Middleton for observing, at this
moment, <div class="bookquote">``that it rained very hard,''  (<font color='red'><b>Lady Middleton/Middleton</b></font>)</div>though she (<font color='blue'><b>Elinor</b></font>) believed the
interruption to proceed less from any attention to her (<font color='blue'><b>Elinor</b></font>), than from her (<font color='blue'><b>Elinor</b></font>)
ladyship's great dislike of all such inelegant subjects of raillery as
delighted her (<font color='blue'><b>Elinor</b></font>) husband and mother. The idea however started by her (<font color='blue'><b>Elinor</b></font>), was
immediately pursued by Colonel Brandon, who was on every occasion
mindful of the feelings of others; and much was said on the subject of
rain by both of them. Willoughby opened the piano-forte, and asked
Marianne to sit down to it; and thus amidst the various endeavours of
different people to quit the topic, it fell to the ground. But not so
easily did Elinor recover from the alarm into which it had thrown her (<font color='blue'><b>Elinor</b></font>).

<p/>To some few of the company it appeared rather a bold undertaking,
considering the time of year, and that it had rained every day for the
last fortnight;--and Mrs. Dashwood, who had already a cold, was
persuaded by Elinor to stay at home.

<p/>Their intended excursion to Whitwell turned out very different from
what Elinor had expected. She (<font color='blue'><b>Elinor</b></font>) was prepared to be wet through,
fatigued, and frightened; but the event was still more unfortunate, for
they did not go at all.

<p/>Elinor then heard Willoughby say, in a low voice to Marianne, <div class="bookquote">``There
are some people who cannot bear a party of pleasure. Brandon is one of
them. He (<font color='blue'><b>Brandon</b></font>) was afraid of catching cold I dare say, and invented this
trick for getting out of it. I would lay fifty guineas the letter was
of his (<font color='blue'><b>Brandon</b></font>) own writing.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Marianne/Miss Marianne</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``What! do not you know who Miss Williams is? I am sure you must have
heard of her (<font color='blue'><b>Williams</b></font>) before. She (<font color='blue'><b>Williams</b></font>) is a relation of the Colonel's, my dear; a
very near relation. We will not say how near, for fear of shocking the
young ladies.''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>Then, lowering her (<font color='blue'><b>Elinor</b></font>) voice a little, she (<font color='blue'><b>Elinor</b></font>) said to Elinor,
<div class="bookquote">``She (<font color='blue'><b>Williams</b></font>) is his (<font color='blue'><b>Colonel</b></font>) natural daughter.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Elinor/-- Elinor/ELINOR</b></font>)</div><p/>It was settled that there should be a dance in the evening, and that
every body should be extremely merry all day long. Some more of the
Careys came to dinner, and they had the pleasure of sitting down nearly
twenty to table, which Sir John observed with great contentment.
Willoughby took his (<font color='blue'><b>Willoughby</b></font>) usual place between the two elder Miss Dashwoods.
Mrs. Jennings sat on Elinor's right hand; and they had not been long
seated, before she (<font color='blue'><b>Elinor</b></font>) leant behind her (<font color='blue'><b>Elinor</b></font>) and Willoughby, and said to
Marianne, loud enough for them both to hear, <div class="bookquote">``I have found you out in
spite of all your tricks. I know where you spent the morning.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Marianne/Miss Marianne</b></font>)</div><p/>Marianne turned away in great confusion. Mrs. Jennings laughed
heartily; and Elinor found that in her (<font color='blue'><b>Elinor</b></font>) resolution to know where they
had been, she (<font color='blue'><b>Elinor</b></font>) had actually made her (<font color='blue'><b>Elinor</b></font>) own woman enquire of Mr.
Willoughby's groom; and that she (<font color='blue'><b>Elinor</b></font>) had by that method been informed that
they had gone to Allenham, and spent a considerable time there in
walking about the garden and going all over the house.

<p/>Elinor could hardly believe this to be true, as it seemed very unlikely
that Willoughby should propose, or Marianne consent, to enter the house
while Mrs. Smith was in it, with whom Marianne had not the smallest
acquaintance.

<p/>As soon as they left the dining-room, Elinor enquired of her (<font color='blue'><b>Elinor</b></font>) about it;
and great was her (<font color='blue'><b>Elinor</b></font>) surprise when she (<font color='blue'><b>Elinor</b></font>) found that every circumstance
related by Mrs. Jennings was perfectly true. Marianne was quite angry
with her (<font color='blue'><b>Marianne</b></font>) for doubting it.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Why should you imagine, Elinor, that we did not go there, or that we
did not see the house? Is not it what you have often wished to do
yourself?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I am afraid,''  (<font color='red'><b>Elinor/-- Elinor/ELINOR</b></font>)</div>replied Elinor, <div class="bookquote">``that the pleasantness of an employment
does not always evince its propriety.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Elinor/-- Elinor/ELINOR</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``On the contrary, nothing can be a stronger proof of it, Elinor; for if
there had been any real impropriety in what I did, I should have been
sensible of it at the time, for we always know when we are acting
wrong, and with such a conviction I could have had no pleasure.''

 (<font color='red'><b>She</b></font>)</div><p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>Elinor</b></font>) blushed at this hint; but it was even visibly gratifying to her (<font color='blue'><b>Elinor</b></font>);
and after a ten minutes' interval of earnest thought, she (<font color='blue'><b>Elinor</b></font>) came to her (<font color='blue'><b>Elinor</b></font>)
sister again, and said with great good humour, <div class="bookquote">``Perhaps, Elinor, it WAS
rather ill-judged in me to go to Allenham; but Mr. Willoughby wanted
particularly to shew me the place; and it is a charming house, I assure
you.--There is one remarkably pretty sitting room up stairs; of a nice
comfortable size for constant use, and with modern furniture it would
be delightful. It is a corner room, and has windows on two sides. On
one side you look across the bowling-green, behind the house, to a
beautiful hanging wood, and on the other you have a view of the church
and village, and, beyond them, of those fine bold hills that we have so
often admired. I did not see it to advantage, for nothing could be
more forlorn than the furniture,--but if it were newly fitted up--a
couple of hundred pounds, Willoughby says, would make it one of the
pleasantest summer-rooms in England.''

 (<font color='red'><b>sister</b></font>)</div><p/>Could Elinor have listened to her (<font color='blue'><b>Elinor</b></font>) without interruption from the others,
she (<font color='blue'><b>Elinor</b></font>) would have described every room in the house with equal delight.

<p/>So wondered, so talked Mrs. Jennings. Her (<font color='blue'><b>Jennings</b></font>) opinion varying with every
fresh conjecture, and all seeming equally probable as they arose.
Elinor, though she (<font color='blue'><b>Elinor</b></font>) felt really interested in the welfare of Colonel
Brandon, could not bestow all the wonder on his (<font color='blue'><b>Brandon</b></font>) going so suddenly away,
which Mrs. Jennings was desirous of her (<font color='blue'><b>Jennings</b></font>) feeling; for besides that the
circumstance did not in her (<font color='blue'><b>Jennings</b></font>) opinion justify such lasting amazement or
variety of speculation, her (<font color='blue'><b>Jennings</b></font>) wonder was otherwise disposed of. It was
engrossed by the extraordinary silence of her (<font color='blue'><b>Jennings</b></font>) sister and Willoughby on
the subject, which they must know to be peculiarly interesting to them
all. As this silence continued, every day made it appear more strange
and more incompatible with the disposition of both. Why they should
not openly acknowledge to her (<font color='blue'><b>Jennings</b></font>) mother and herself, what their constant
behaviour to each other declared to have taken place, Elinor could not
imagine.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``With dark narrow stairs and a kitchen that smokes, I suppose,''  (<font color='red'><b>Elinor/-- Elinor/ELINOR</b></font>)</div>said
Elinor.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``I flatter myself,''  (<font color='red'><b>Elinor/-- Elinor/ELINOR</b></font>)</div>replied Elinor, <div class="bookquote">``that even under the disadvantage
of better rooms and a broader staircase, you will hereafter find your
own house as faultless as you now do this.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Elinor/-- Elinor/ELINOR</b></font>)</div><p/>Mrs. Dashwood looked at Elinor with surprise. Elinor felt equal
amazement. For a few moments every one was silent. Mrs. Dashwood
first spoke.

<p/>Elinor's uneasiness was at least equal to her (<font color='blue'><b>Elinor</b></font>) mother's. She (<font color='blue'><b>Elinor</b></font>) thought of
what had just passed with anxiety and distrust. Willoughby's behaviour
in taking leave of them, his (<font color='blue'><b>Willoughby</b></font>) embarrassment, and affectation of
cheerfulness, and, above all, his (<font color='blue'><b>Willoughby</b></font>) unwillingness to accept her (<font color='blue'><b>Elinor</b></font>) mother's
invitation, a backwardness so unlike a lover, so unlike himself,
greatly disturbed her (<font color='blue'><b>Elinor</b></font>). One moment she (<font color='blue'><b>Elinor</b></font>) feared that no serious design
had ever been formed on his (<font color='blue'><b>Willoughby</b></font>) side; and the next that some unfortunate
quarrel had taken place between him (<font color='blue'><b>Willoughby</b></font>) and her (<font color='blue'><b>Elinor</b></font>) sister;--the distress in
which Marianne had quitted the room was such as a serious quarrel could
most reasonably account for, though when she (<font color='blue'><b>Marianne</b></font>) considered what Marianne's
love for him (<font color='blue'><b>Willoughby</b></font>) was, a quarrel seemed almost impossible.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Our dear Willoughby is now some miles from Barton, Elinor,''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>said she (<font color='blue'><b>Marianne</b></font>),
as she (<font color='blue'><b>Marianne</b></font>) sat down to work, <div class="bookquote">``and with how heavy a heart does he (<font color='blue'><b>Willoughby</b></font>) travel?''

 (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``It was not inclination that he (<font color='blue'><b>Willoughby</b></font>) wanted, Elinor; I could plainly see
THAT. He (<font color='blue'><b>Willoughby</b></font>) had not the power of accepting it. I have thought it all
over I assure you, and I can perfectly account for every thing that at
first seemed strange to me as well as to you.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Yes. I have explained it to myself in the most satisfactory way;--but
you, Elinor, who love to doubt where you can--it will not satisfy YOU,
I know; but you shall not talk ME out of my trust in it. I am
persuaded that Mrs. Smith suspects his (<font color='blue'><b>Willoughby</b></font>) regard for Marianne, disapproves
of it, -LRB-perhaps because she (<font color='blue'><b>Marianne</b></font>) has other views for him (<font color='blue'><b>Willoughby</b></font>),-RRB- and on that
account is eager to get him (<font color='blue'><b>Willoughby</b></font>) away;--and that the business which she (<font color='blue'><b>Marianne</b></font>)
sends him (<font color='blue'><b>Willoughby</b></font>) off to transact is invented as an excuse to dismiss him (<font color='blue'><b>Willoughby</b></font>).
This is what I believe to have happened. He (<font color='blue'><b>Willoughby</b></font>) is, moreover, aware that
she (<font color='blue'><b>Marianne</b></font>) DOES disapprove the connection, he (<font color='blue'><b>Willoughby</b></font>) dares not therefore at present
confess to her (<font color='blue'><b>Marianne</b></font>) his (<font color='blue'><b>Willoughby</b></font>) engagement with Marianne, and he (<font color='blue'><b>Willoughby</b></font>) feels himself
obliged, from his (<font color='blue'><b>Willoughby</b></font>) dependent situation, to give into her (<font color='blue'><b>Marianne</b></font>) schemes, and
absent himself from Devonshire for a while. You will tell me, I know,
that this may or may NOT have happened; but I will listen to no cavil,
unless you can point out any other method of understanding the affair
as satisfactory at this. And now, Elinor, what have you to say?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Then you would have told me, that it might or might not have happened.
Oh, Elinor, how incomprehensible are your feelings! You had rather
take evil upon credit than good. You had rather look out for misery
for Marianne, and guilt for poor Willoughby, than an apology for the
latter. You are resolved to think him (<font color='blue'><b>Willoughby</b></font>) blameable, because he (<font color='blue'><b>Willoughby</b></font>) took leave
of us with less affection than his (<font color='blue'><b>Willoughby</b></font>) usual behaviour has shewn. And is
no allowance to be made for inadvertence, or for spirits depressed by
recent disappointment? Are no probabilities to be accepted, merely
because they are not certainties? Is nothing due to the man whom we
have all such reason to love, and no reason in the world to think ill
of? To the possibility of motives unanswerable in themselves, though
unavoidably secret for a while? And, after all, what is it you suspect
him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) of?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I want no proof of their affection,''  (<font color='red'><b>Elinor/-- Elinor/ELINOR</b></font>)</div>said Elinor; <div class="bookquote">``but of their
engagement I do.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Elinor/-- Elinor/ELINOR</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I have not wanted syllables where actions have spoken so plainly. Has
not his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) behaviour to Marianne and to all of us, for at least the last
fortnight, declared that he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) loved and considered her (<font color='blue'><b>Marianne</b></font>) as his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) future
wife, and that he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) felt for us the attachment of the nearest relation?
Have we not perfectly understood each other? Has not my consent been
daily asked by his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) looks, his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) manner, his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) attentive and affectionate
respect? My Elinor, is it possible to doubt their engagement? How
could such a thought occur to you? How is it to be supposed that
Willoughby, persuaded as he (<font color='blue'><b>Willoughby</b></font>) must be of your sister's love, should leave
her (<font color='blue'><b>sister</b></font>), and leave her (<font color='blue'><b>sister</b></font>) perhaps for months, without telling her (<font color='blue'><b>sister</b></font>) of his (<font color='blue'><b>Willoughby</b></font>)
affection;--that they should part without a mutual exchange of
confidence?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I confess,''  (<font color='red'><b>Elinor/-- Elinor/ELINOR</b></font>)</div>replied Elinor, <div class="bookquote">``that every circumstance except ONE is in
favour of their engagement; but that ONE is the total silence of both
on the subject, and with me it almost outweighs every other.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Elinor/-- Elinor/ELINOR</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I hope not, I believe not,''  (<font color='red'><b>Elinor/-- Elinor/ELINOR</b></font>)</div>cried Elinor. <div class="bookquote">``I love Willoughby,
sincerely love him (<font color='blue'><b>Willoughby</b></font>); and suspicion of his (<font color='blue'><b>Willoughby</b></font>) integrity cannot be more
painful to yourself than to me. It has been involuntary, and I will
not encourage it. I was startled, I confess, by the alteration in his (<font color='blue'><b>Willoughby</b></font>)
manners this morning;--he (<font color='blue'><b>Willoughby</b></font>) did not speak like himself, and did not
return your kindness with any cordiality. But all this may be
explained by such a situation of his (<font color='blue'><b>Willoughby</b></font>) affairs as you have supposed. He (<font color='blue'><b>Willoughby</b></font>)
had just parted from my sister, had seen her (<font color='blue'><b>sister</b></font>) leave him (<font color='blue'><b>Willoughby</b></font>) in the greatest
affliction; and if he (<font color='blue'><b>Willoughby</b></font>) felt obliged, from a fear of offending Mrs.
Smith, to resist the temptation of returning here soon, and yet aware
that by declining your invitation, by saying that he (<font color='blue'><b>Willoughby</b></font>) was going away for
some time, he (<font color='blue'><b>Willoughby</b></font>) should seem to act an ungenerous, a suspicious part by
our family, he (<font color='blue'><b>Willoughby</b></font>) might well be embarrassed and disturbed. In such a
case, a plain and open avowal of his (<font color='blue'><b>Willoughby</b></font>) difficulties would have been more
to his (<font color='blue'><b>Willoughby</b></font>) honour I think, as well as more consistent with his (<font color='blue'><b>Willoughby</b></font>) general
character;--but I will not raise objections against any one's conduct
on so illiberal a foundation, as a difference in judgment from myself,
or a deviation from what I may think right and consistent.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Margaret</b></font>)</div><p/>They were interrupted by the entrance of Margaret; and Elinor was then
at liberty to think over the representations of her (<font color='blue'><b>Elinor</b></font>) mother, to
acknowledge the probability of many, and hope for the justice of all.

<p/>No letter from Willoughby came; and none seemed expected by Marianne.
Her (<font color='blue'><b>Marianne</b></font>) mother was surprised, and Elinor again became uneasy. But Mrs.
Dashwood could find explanations whenever she (<font color='blue'><b>Dashwood</b></font>) wanted them, which at
least satisfied herself.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Remember, Elinor,''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>said she (<font color='blue'><b>Dashwood</b></font>), <div class="bookquote">``how very often Sir John fetches our
letters himself from the post, and carries them to it. We have already
agreed that secrecy may be necessary, and we must acknowledge that it
could not be maintained if their correspondence were to pass through
Sir John's hands.''

 (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div><p/>Elinor could not deny the truth of this, and she (<font color='blue'><b>Elinor</b></font>) tried to find in it a
motive sufficient for their silence. But there was one method so
direct, so simple, and in her (<font color='blue'><b>Elinor</b></font>) opinion so eligible of knowing the real
state of the affair, and of instantly removing all mystery, that she (<font color='blue'><b>Elinor</b></font>)
could not help suggesting it to her (<font color='blue'><b>Elinor</b></font>) mother.

<p/>Elinor thought this generosity overstrained, considering her (<font color='blue'><b>Elinor</b></font>) sister's
youth, and urged the matter farther, but in vain; common sense, common
care, common prudence, were all sunk in Mrs. Dashwood's romantic
delicacy.

<p/>Mrs. Dashwood was sorry for what she (<font color='blue'><b>Dashwood</b></font>) had said; but it gave Elinor
pleasure, as it produced a reply from Marianne so expressive of
confidence in Willoughby and knowledge of his (<font color='blue'><b>Willoughby</b></font>) intentions.

<p/>One morning, about a week after his (<font color='blue'><b>Willoughby</b></font>) leaving the country, Marianne was
prevailed on to join her (<font color='blue'><b>Marianne</b></font>) sisters in their usual walk, instead of
wandering away by herself. Hitherto she (<font color='blue'><b>Marianne</b></font>) had carefully avoided every
companion in her (<font color='blue'><b>Marianne</b></font>) rambles. If her (<font color='blue'><b>Marianne</b></font>) sisters intended to walk on the
downs, she (<font color='blue'><b>Marianne</b></font>) directly stole away towards the lanes; if they talked of the
valley, she (<font color='blue'><b>Marianne</b></font>) was as speedy in climbing the hills, and could never be
found when the others set off. But at length she (<font color='blue'><b>Marianne</b></font>) was secured by the
exertions of Elinor, who greatly disapproved such continual seclusion.
They walked along the road through the valley, and chiefly in silence,
for Marianne's MIND could not be controlled, and Elinor, satisfied with
gaining one point, would not then attempt more. Beyond the entrance of
the valley, where the country, though still rich, was less wild and
more open, a long stretch of the road which they had travelled on first
coming to Barton, lay before them; and on reaching that point, they
stopped to look around them, and examine a prospect which formed the
distance of their view from the cottage, from a spot which they had
never happened to reach in any of their walks before.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``It is he (<font color='blue'><b>I</b></font>); it is indeed;--I know it is!'' (<font color='red'><b>him</b></font>)</div>--and was hastening to meet
him (<font color='blue'><b>Barton</b></font>), when Elinor cried out,

<p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>Elinor</b></font>) walked eagerly on as she (<font color='blue'><b>Elinor</b></font>) spoke; and Elinor, to screen Marianne from
particularity, as she (<font color='blue'><b>Elinor</b></font>) felt almost certain of its not being Willoughby,
quickened her (<font color='blue'><b>Elinor</b></font>) pace and kept up with her (<font color='blue'><b>Elinor</b></font>). They were soon within thirty
yards of the gentleman. Marianne looked again; her (<font color='blue'><b>Marianne</b></font>) heart sunk within
her (<font color='blue'><b>Marianne</b></font>); and abruptly turning round, she (<font color='blue'><b>Marianne</b></font>) was hurrying back, when the voices
of both her (<font color='blue'><b>Marianne</b></font>) sisters were raised to detain her (<font color='blue'><b>Marianne</b></font>); a third, almost as well
known as Willoughby's, joined them in begging her (<font color='blue'><b>Marianne</b></font>) to stop, and she (<font color='blue'><b>Marianne</b></font>)
turned round with surprise to see and welcome Edward Ferrars.

<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Ferrars</b></font>) was welcomed by them all with great cordiality, but especially by
Marianne, who showed more warmth of regard in her (<font color='blue'><b>Marianne</b></font>) reception of him (<font color='blue'><b>Ferrars</b></font>) than
even Elinor herself. To Marianne, indeed, the meeting between Edward
and her (<font color='blue'><b>Marianne</b></font>) sister was but a continuation of that unaccountable coldness
which she (<font color='blue'><b>Marianne</b></font>) had often observed at Norland in their mutual behaviour. On
Edward's side, more particularly, there was a deficiency of all that a
lover ought to look and say on such an occasion. He (<font color='blue'><b>lover</b></font>) was confused,
seemed scarcely sensible of pleasure in seeing them, looked neither
rapturous nor gay, said little but what was forced from him (<font color='blue'><b>lover</b></font>) by
questions, and distinguished Elinor by no mark of affection. Marianne
saw and listened with increasing surprise. She (<font color='blue'><b>Marianne</b></font>) began almost to feel a
dislike of Edward; and it ended, as every feeling must end with her (<font color='blue'><b>Marianne</b></font>), by
carrying back her (<font color='blue'><b>Marianne</b></font>) thoughts to Willoughby, whose manners formed a
contrast sufficiently striking to those of his (<font color='blue'><b>Willoughby</b></font>) brother elect.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``A fortnight!''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Marianne</b></font>) repeated, surprised at his (<font color='blue'><b>Willoughby</b></font>) being so long in the same
county with Elinor without seeing her (<font color='blue'><b>Elinor</b></font>) before.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Have you been lately in Sussex?''  (<font color='red'><b>Elinor/-- Elinor/ELINOR</b></font>)</div>said Elinor.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Dear, dear Norland,''  (<font color='red'><b>Elinor/-- Elinor/ELINOR</b></font>)</div>said Elinor, <div class="bookquote">``probably looks much as it always
does at this time of the year. The woods and walks thickly covered
with dead leaves.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Elinor/-- Elinor/ELINOR</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``It is not every one,''  (<font color='red'><b>Elinor/-- Elinor/ELINOR</b></font>)</div>said Elinor, <div class="bookquote">``who has your passion for dead
leaves.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Elinor/-- Elinor/ELINOR</b></font>)</div><p/>Elinor took no notice of this; and directing her (<font color='blue'><b>Elinor</b></font>) attention to their
visitor, endeavoured to support something like discourse with him (<font color='blue'><b>visitor</b></font>), by
talking of their present residence, its conveniences, &c. extorting
from him (<font color='blue'><b>visitor</b></font>) occasional questions and remarks. His (<font color='blue'><b>visitor</b></font>) coldness and reserve
mortified her (<font color='blue'><b>Elinor</b></font>) severely; she (<font color='blue'><b>Elinor</b></font>) was vexed and half angry; but resolving to
regulate her (<font color='blue'><b>Elinor</b></font>) behaviour to him (<font color='blue'><b>visitor</b></font>) by the past rather than the present, she (<font color='blue'><b>Elinor</b></font>)
avoided every appearance of resentment or displeasure, and treated him (<font color='blue'><b>visitor</b></font>)
as she (<font color='blue'><b>Elinor</b></font>) thought he (<font color='blue'><b>visitor</b></font>) ought to be treated from the family connection.

<p/>Mrs. Dashwood was surprised only for a moment at seeing him (<font color='blue'><b>visitor</b></font>); for his (<font color='blue'><b>visitor</b></font>)
coming to Barton was, in her (<font color='blue'><b>Dashwood</b></font>) opinion, of all things the most natural.
Her (<font color='blue'><b>Dashwood</b></font>) joy and expression of regard long outlived her (<font color='blue'><b>Dashwood</b></font>) wonder. He (<font color='blue'><b>visitor</b></font>) received
the kindest welcome from her (<font color='blue'><b>Dashwood</b></font>); and shyness, coldness, reserve could not
stand against such a reception. They had begun to fail him (<font color='blue'><b>visitor</b></font>) before he (<font color='blue'><b>visitor</b></font>)
entered the house, and they were quite overcome by the captivating
manners of Mrs. Dashwood. Indeed a man could not very well be in love
with either of her (<font color='blue'><b>Dashwood</b></font>) daughters, without extending the passion to her (<font color='blue'><b>Dashwood</b></font>); and
Elinor had the satisfaction of seeing him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) soon become more like
himself. His (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) affections seemed to reanimate towards them all, and his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>)
interest in their welfare again became perceptible. He (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) was not in
spirits, however; he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) praised their house, admired its prospect, was
attentive, and kind; but still he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) was not in spirits. The whole family
perceived it, and Mrs. Dashwood, attributing it to some want of
liberality in his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) mother, sat down to table indignant against all
selfish parents.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Grandeur has but little,''  (<font color='red'><b>Elinor/-- Elinor/ELINOR</b></font>)</div>said Elinor, <div class="bookquote">``but wealth has much to do with
it.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Elinor/-- Elinor/ELINOR</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Elinor, for shame!''  (<font color='red'><b>Marianne/Miss Marianne</b></font>)</div>said Marianne, <div class="bookquote">``money can only give happiness
where there is nothing else to give it. Beyond a competence, it can
afford no real satisfaction, as far as mere self is concerned.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Marianne/Miss Marianne</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Perhaps,''  (<font color='red'><b>Elinor/-- Elinor/ELINOR</b></font>)</div>said Elinor, smiling, <div class="bookquote">``we may come to the same point. YOUR
competence and MY wealth are very much alike, I dare say; and without
them, as the world goes now, we shall both agree that every kind of
external comfort must be wanting. Your ideas are only more noble than
mine. Come, what is your competence?''

 (<font color='red'><b>Elinor/-- Elinor/ELINOR</b></font>)</div><p/>Elinor laughed. <div class="bookquote">``TWO thousand a year! ONE is my wealth! I guessed how
it would end.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Elinor/-- Elinor/ELINOR</b></font>)</div><p/>Elinor smiled again, to hear her (<font color='blue'><b>Elinor</b></font>) sister describing so accurately their

<p/><div class="bookquote">``We are all unanimous in that wish, I suppose,''  (<font color='red'><b>Elinor/-- Elinor/ELINOR</b></font>)</div>said Elinor, <div class="bookquote">``in spite
of the insufficiency of wealth.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Elinor/-- Elinor/ELINOR</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``You must begin your improvements on this house,''  (<font color='red'><b>Elinor/-- Elinor/ELINOR</b></font>)</div>observed Elinor, <div class="bookquote">``and
your difficulties will soon vanish.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Elinor/-- Elinor/ELINOR</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Marianne is as steadfast as ever, you see,''  (<font color='red'><b>Elinor/-- Elinor/ELINOR</b></font>)</div>said Elinor, <div class="bookquote">``she (<font color='blue'><b>Marianne</b></font>) is not
at all altered.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Elinor/-- Elinor/ELINOR</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Nor do I think it a part of Marianne's,''  (<font color='red'><b>Elinor/-- Elinor/ELINOR</b></font>)</div>said Elinor; <div class="bookquote">``I should hardly
call her (<font color='blue'><b>Marianne</b></font>) a lively girl--she (<font color='blue'><b>Marianne</b></font>) is very earnest, very eager in all she (<font color='blue'><b>Marianne</b></font>)
does--sometimes talks a great deal and always with animation--but she (<font color='blue'><b>Marianne</b></font>)
is not often really merry.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Elinor/-- Elinor/ELINOR</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I have frequently detected myself in such kind of mistakes,''  (<font color='red'><b>Elinor/-- Elinor/ELINOR</b></font>)</div>said
Elinor, <div class="bookquote">``in a total misapprehension of character in some point or
other: fancying people so much more gay or grave, or ingenious or
stupid than they really are, and I can hardly tell why or in what the
deception originated. Sometimes one is guided by what they say of
themselves, and very frequently by what other people say of them,
without giving oneself time to deliberate and judge.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Elinor/-- Elinor/ELINOR</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``But I thought it was right, Elinor,''  (<font color='red'><b>Marianne/Miss Marianne</b></font>)</div>said Marianne, <div class="bookquote">``to be guided
wholly by the opinion of other people. I thought our judgments were
given us merely to be subservient to those of neighbours. This has
always been your doctrine, I am sure.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Marianne/Miss Marianne</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``You have not been able to bring your sister over to your plan of
general civility,''  (<font color='red'><b>Edward/Mr. Ferrars/Edward Ferrars</b></font>)</div>said Edward to Elinor. <div class="bookquote">``Do you gain no ground?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Quite the contrary,''  (<font color='red'><b>Elinor/-- Elinor/ELINOR</b></font>)</div>replied Elinor, looking expressively at Marianne.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Marianne has not shyness to excuse any inattention of hers,''  (<font color='red'><b>Elinor/-- Elinor/ELINOR</b></font>)</div>said
Elinor.

<p/>Elinor looked surprised at his (<font color='blue'><b>Edward</b></font>) emotion; but trying to laugh off the
subject, she (<font color='blue'><b>Elinor</b></font>) said to him (<font color='blue'><b>Edward</b></font>), <div class="bookquote">``Do not you know my sister well enough to
understand what she (<font color='blue'><b>Marianne</b></font>) means? Do not you know she (<font color='blue'><b>Marianne</b></font>) calls every one
reserved who does not talk as fast, and admire what she (<font color='blue'><b>Marianne</b></font>) admires as
rapturously as herself?''

 (<font color='red'><b>him</b></font>)</div><p/>Elinor saw, with great uneasiness the low spirits of her (<font color='blue'><b>Elinor</b></font>) friend. His (<font color='blue'><b>friend</b></font>)
visit afforded her (<font color='blue'><b>Elinor</b></font>) but a very partial satisfaction, while his (<font color='blue'><b>friend</b></font>) own
enjoyment in it appeared so imperfect. It was evident that he (<font color='blue'><b>friend</b></font>) was
unhappy; she (<font color='blue'><b>Elinor</b></font>) wished it were equally evident that he (<font color='blue'><b>friend</b></font>) still distinguished
her (<font color='blue'><b>Elinor</b></font>) by the same affection which once she (<font color='blue'><b>Elinor</b></font>) had felt no doubt of
inspiring; but hitherto the continuance of his (<font color='blue'><b>friend</b></font>) preference seemed very
uncertain; and the reservedness of his (<font color='blue'><b>friend</b></font>) manner towards her (<font color='blue'><b>Elinor</b></font>) contradicted
one moment what a more animated look had intimated the preceding one.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``I suspect,''  (<font color='red'><b>Elinor/-- Elinor/ELINOR</b></font>)</div>said Elinor, <div class="bookquote">``that to avoid one kind of affectation,
Edward here falls into another. Because he (<font color='blue'><b>Edward</b></font>) believes many people
pretend to more admiration of the beauties of nature than they really
feel, and is disgusted with such pretensions, he (<font color='blue'><b>Edward</b></font>) affects greater
indifference and less discrimination in viewing them himself than he (<font color='blue'><b>Edward</b></font>)
possesses. He (<font color='blue'><b>Edward</b></font>) is fastidious and will have an affectation of his (<font color='blue'><b>Edward</b></font>) own.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Elinor/-- Elinor/ELINOR</b></font>)</div><p/>Marianne looked with amazement at Edward, with compassion at her (<font color='blue'><b>Elinor</b></font>)
sister. Elinor only laughed.

<p/>Marianne spoke inconsiderately what she (<font color='blue'><b>Elinor</b></font>) really felt--but when she (<font color='blue'><b>Elinor</b></font>) saw
how much she (<font color='blue'><b>Elinor</b></font>) had pained Edward, her (<font color='blue'><b>Elinor</b></font>) own vexation at her (<font color='blue'><b>Elinor</b></font>) want of thought
could not be surpassed by his (<font color='blue'><b>Edward</b></font>). He (<font color='blue'><b>Edward</b></font>) coloured very deeply, and giving a
momentary glance at Elinor, replied, <div class="bookquote">``Yes; it is my sister's hair. The
setting always casts a different shade on it, you know.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Elinor</b></font>)</div><p/>Elinor had met his (<font color='blue'><b>Edward</b></font>) eye, and looked conscious likewise. That the hair
was her (<font color='blue'><b>Elinor</b></font>) own, she (<font color='blue'><b>Elinor</b></font>) instantaneously felt as well satisfied as Marianne;
the only difference in their conclusions was, that what Marianne
considered as a free gift from her (<font color='blue'><b>Marianne</b></font>) sister, Elinor was conscious must
have been procured by some theft or contrivance unknown to herself.
She (<font color='blue'><b>Elinor</b></font>) was not in a humour, however, to regard it as an affront, and
affecting to take no notice of what passed, by instantly talking of
something else, she (<font color='blue'><b>Elinor</b></font>) internally resolved henceforward to catch every
opportunity of eyeing the hair and of satisfying herself, beyond all
doubt, that it was exactly the shade of her (<font color='blue'><b>Elinor</b></font>) own.

<p/>Before the middle of the day, they were visited by Sir John and Mrs.
Jennings, who, having heard of the arrival of a gentleman at the
cottage, came to take a survey of the guest. With the assistance of
his (<font color='blue'><b>guest</b></font>) mother-in-law, Sir John was not long in discovering that the name
of Ferrars began with an F. and this prepared a future mine of raillery
against the devoted Elinor, which nothing but the newness of their
acquaintance with Edward could have prevented from being immediately
sprung. But, as it was, she (<font color='blue'><b>Elinor</b></font>) only learned, from some very significant
looks, how far their penetration, founded on Margaret's instructions,
extended.

<p/>Elinor placed all that was astonishing in this way of acting to his (<font color='blue'><b>Edward</b></font>)
mother's account; and it was happy for her (<font color='blue'><b>Elinor</b></font>) that he (<font color='blue'><b>Edward</b></font>) had a mother whose
character was so imperfectly known to her (<font color='blue'><b>Elinor</b></font>), as to be the general excuse
for every thing strange on the part of her (<font color='blue'><b>Elinor</b></font>) son. Disappointed, however,
and vexed as she (<font color='blue'><b>Elinor</b></font>) was, and sometimes displeased with his (<font color='blue'><b>son</b></font>) uncertain
behaviour to herself, she (<font color='blue'><b>Elinor</b></font>) was very well disposed on the whole to regard
his (<font color='blue'><b>son</b></font>) actions with all the candid allowances and generous qualifications,
which had been rather more painfully extorted from her (<font color='blue'><b>Elinor</b></font>), for
Willoughby's service, by her (<font color='blue'><b>Elinor</b></font>) mother. His (<font color='blue'><b>Willoughby</b></font>) want of spirits, of openness,
and of consistency, were most usually attributed to his (<font color='blue'><b>Willoughby</b></font>) want of
independence, and his (<font color='blue'><b>Willoughby</b></font>) better knowledge of Mrs. Ferrars's disposition
and designs. The shortness of his (<font color='blue'><b>Willoughby</b></font>) visit, the steadiness of his (<font color='blue'><b>Willoughby</b></font>) purpose
in leaving them, originated in the same fettered inclination, the same
inevitable necessity of temporizing with his (<font color='blue'><b>Willoughby</b></font>) mother. The old
well-established grievance of duty against will, parent against child,
was the cause of all. She (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) would have been glad to know when these
difficulties were to cease, this opposition was to yield,--when Mrs.
Ferrars would be reformed, and her (<font color='blue'><b>Ferrars</b></font>) son be at liberty to be happy. But
from such vain wishes she (<font color='blue'><b>Ferrars</b></font>) was forced to turn for comfort to the renewal
of her (<font color='blue'><b>Ferrars</b></font>) confidence in Edward's affection, to the remembrance of every
mark of regard in look or word which fell from him (<font color='blue'><b>Edward</b></font>) while at Barton, and
above all to that flattering proof of it which he (<font color='blue'><b>Barton</b></font>) constantly wore round
his (<font color='blue'><b>Barton</b></font>) finger.

<p/>This desponding turn of mind, though it could not be communicated to
Mrs. Dashwood, gave additional pain to them all in the parting, which
shortly took place, and left an uncomfortable impression on Elinor's
feelings especially, which required some trouble and time to subdue.
But as it was her (<font color='blue'><b>Elinor</b></font>) determination to subdue it, and to prevent herself
from appearing to suffer more than what all her (<font color='blue'><b>Elinor</b></font>) family suffered on his (<font color='blue'><b>Barton</b></font>)
going away, she (<font color='blue'><b>Elinor</b></font>) did not adopt the method so judiciously employed by
Marianne, on a similar occasion, to augment and fix her (<font color='blue'><b>Marianne</b></font>) sorrow, by
seeking silence, solitude and idleness. Their means were as different
as their objects, and equally suited to the advancement of each.

<p/>Elinor sat down to her (<font color='blue'><b>Elinor</b></font>) drawing-table as soon as he (<font color='blue'><b>Barton</b></font>) was out of the
house, busily employed herself the whole day, neither sought nor
avoided the mention of his (<font color='blue'><b>Barton</b></font>) name, appeared to interest herself almost as
much as ever in the general concerns of the family, and if, by this
conduct, she (<font color='blue'><b>Elinor</b></font>) did not lessen her (<font color='blue'><b>Elinor</b></font>) own grief, it was at least prevented
from unnecessary increase, and her (<font color='blue'><b>Elinor</b></font>) mother and sisters were spared much
solicitude on her (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) account.

<p/>Without shutting herself up from her (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) family, or leaving the house in
determined solitude to avoid them, or lying awake the whole night to
indulge meditation, Elinor found every day afforded her (<font color='blue'><b>Elinor</b></font>) leisure enough
to think of Edward, and of Edward's behaviour, in every possible
variety which the different state of her (<font color='blue'><b>Elinor</b></font>) spirits at different times
could produce,--with tenderness, pity, approbation, censure, and doubt.
There were moments in abundance, when, if not by the absence of her (<font color='blue'><b>Elinor</b></font>)
mother and sisters, at least by the nature of their employments,
conversation was forbidden among them, and every effect of solitude was
produced. Her (<font color='blue'><b>Elinor</b></font>) mind was inevitably at liberty; her (<font color='blue'><b>Elinor</b></font>) thoughts could not
be chained elsewhere; and the past and the future, on a subject so
interesting, must be before her (<font color='blue'><b>Elinor</b></font>), must force her (<font color='blue'><b>Elinor</b></font>) attention, and engross
her (<font color='blue'><b>Elinor</b></font>) memory, her (<font color='blue'><b>Elinor</b></font>) reflection, and her (<font color='blue'><b>Elinor</b></font>) fancy.

<p/>As Elinor was certain of seeing her (<font color='blue'><b>Elinor</b></font>) in a couple of minutes, without
taking that liberty, she (<font color='blue'><b>Elinor</b></font>) begged to be excused.

<p/>Elinor was obliged to turn from her (<font color='blue'><b>Elinor</b></font>), in the middle of her (<font color='blue'><b>Elinor</b></font>) story, to
receive the rest of the party; Lady Middleton introduced the two
strangers; Mrs. Dashwood and Margaret came down stairs at the same
time, and they all sat down to look at one another, while Mrs. Jennings
continued her (<font color='blue'><b>Jennings</b></font>) story as she (<font color='blue'><b>Jennings</b></font>) walked through the passage into the parlour,
attended by Sir John.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``You may believe how glad we all were to see them,''  (<font color='red'><b>Mrs. Jennings</b></font>)</div>added Mrs.
Jennings, leaning forward towards Elinor, and speaking in a low voice
as if she (<font color='blue'><b>Elinor</b></font>) meant to be heard by no one else, though they were seated on
different sides of the room; <div class="bookquote">``but, however, I can't help wishing they
had not travelled quite so fast, nor made such a long journey of it,
for they came all round by London upon account of some business, for
you know -LRB-nodding significantly and pointing to her (<font color='blue'><b>sister</b></font>) daughter-RRB- it was
wrong in her (<font color='blue'><b>sister</b></font>) situation. I wanted her (<font color='blue'><b>sister</b></font>) to stay at home and rest this
morning, but she (<font color='blue'><b>sister</b></font>) would come with us; she (<font color='blue'><b>sister</b></font>) longed so much to see you all!''

 (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``They mean no less to be civil and kind to us now,''  (<font color='red'><b>Elinor/-- Elinor/ELINOR</b></font>)</div>said Elinor, <div class="bookquote">``by
these frequent invitations, than by those which we received from them a
few weeks ago. The alteration is not in them, if their parties are
grown tedious and dull. We must look for the change elsewhere.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Elinor/-- Elinor/ELINOR</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I am so glad to see you!''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>said she (<font color='blue'><b>Elinor</b></font>), seating herself between Elinor and
Marianne, <div class="bookquote">``for it is so bad a day I was afraid you might not come,
which would be a shocking thing, as we go away again tomorrow. We must
go, for the Westons come to us next week you know. It was quite a
sudden thing our coming at all, and I knew nothing of it till the
carriage was coming to the door, and then Mr. Palmer asked me if I
would go with him (<font color='blue'><b>Palmer</b></font>) to Barton. He (<font color='blue'><b>Barton</b></font>) is so droll! He (<font color='blue'><b>Barton</b></font>) never tells me any
thing! I am so sorry we cannot stay longer; however we shall meet again
in town very soon, I hope.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Marianne/Miss Marianne</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Mr. Palmer is so droll!''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>said she (<font color='blue'><b>Elinor</b></font>), in a whisper, to Elinor. <div class="bookquote">``He (<font color='blue'><b>Palmer</b></font>) is
always out of humour.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Elinor/-- Elinor/ELINOR</b></font>)</div><p/>Elinor was not inclined, after a little observation, to give him (<font color='blue'><b>Elinor</b></font>) credit
for being so genuinely and unaffectedly ill-natured or ill-bred as he (<font color='blue'><b>Elinor</b></font>)
wished to appear. His (<font color='blue'><b>Elinor</b></font>) temper might perhaps be a little soured by
finding, like many others of his (<font color='blue'><b>Elinor</b></font>) sex, that through some unaccountable
bias in favour of beauty, he (<font color='blue'><b>Elinor</b></font>) was the husband of a very silly
woman,--but she (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) knew that this kind of blunder was too common for any
sensible man to be lastingly hurt by it.-- It was rather a wish of
distinction, she (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) believed, which produced his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) contemptuous treatment of
every body, and his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) general abuse of every thing before him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>). It was
the desire of appearing superior to other people. The motive was too
common to be wondered at; but the means, however they might succeed by
establishing his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) superiority in ill-breeding, were not likely to attach
any one to him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) except his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) wife.

<p/>Elinor could hardly keep her (<font color='blue'><b>Elinor</b></font>) countenance as she (<font color='blue'><b>Elinor</b></font>) assented to the
hardship of such an obligation.

<p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>Elinor</b></font>) surprised Elinor very much as they returned into the drawing-room,
by asking her (<font color='blue'><b>Elinor</b></font>) whether she (<font color='blue'><b>Elinor</b></font>) did not like Mr. Palmer excessively.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Certainly,''  (<font color='red'><b>Elinor/-- Elinor/ELINOR</b></font>)</div>said Elinor; <div class="bookquote">``he (<font color='blue'><b>Palmer</b></font>) seems very agreeable.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Elinor/-- Elinor/ELINOR</b></font>)</div><p/>Elinor was again obliged to decline her (<font color='blue'><b>Elinor</b></font>) invitation; and by changing the
subject, put a stop to her (<font color='blue'><b>Elinor</b></font>) entreaties. She (<font color='blue'><b>Elinor</b></font>) thought it probable that as
they lived in the same county, Mrs. Palmer might be able to give some
more particular account of Willoughby's general character, than could
be gathered from the Middletons' partial acquaintance with him (<font color='blue'><b>acquaintance</b></font>); and she (<font color='blue'><b>Palmer</b></font>)
was eager to gain from any one, such a confirmation of his (<font color='blue'><b>acquaintance</b></font>) merits as
might remove the possibility of fear from Marianne. She (<font color='blue'><b>Marianne</b></font>) began by
inquiring if they saw much of Mr. Willoughby at Cleveland, and whether
they were intimately acquainted with him (<font color='blue'><b>Willoughby</b></font>).

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Upon my word,''  (<font color='red'><b>Elinor/-- Elinor/ELINOR</b></font>)</div>replied Elinor, <div class="bookquote">``you know much more of the matter than
I do, if you have any reason to expect such a match.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Elinor/-- Elinor/ELINOR</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Is Mr. Willoughby much known in your part of Somersetshire?''  (<font color='red'><b>Elinor/-- Elinor/ELINOR</b></font>)</div>said
Elinor.

<p/>The Palmers returned to Cleveland the next day, and the two families at
Barton were again left to entertain each other. But this did not last
long; Elinor had hardly got their last visitors out of her (<font color='blue'><b>Elinor</b></font>) head, had
hardly done wondering at Charlotte's being so happy without a cause, at
Mr. Palmer's acting so simply, with good abilities, and at the strange
unsuitableness which often existed between husband and wife, before Sir
John's and Mrs. Jennings's active zeal in the cause of society,
procured her (<font color='blue'><b>John</b></font>) some other new acquaintance to see and observe.

<p/>The young ladies arrived: their appearance was by no means ungenteel or
unfashionable. Their dress was very smart, their manners very civil,
they were delighted with the house, and in raptures with the furniture,
and they happened to be so doatingly fond of children that Lady
Middleton's good opinion was engaged in their favour before they had
been an hour at the Park. She (<font color='blue'><b>Middleton</b></font>) declared them to be very agreeable girls
indeed, which for her (<font color='blue'><b>Middleton</b></font>) ladyship was enthusiastic admiration. Sir John's
confidence in his (<font color='blue'><b>acquaintance</b></font>) own judgment rose with this animated praise, and he (<font color='blue'><b>acquaintance</b></font>)
set off directly for the cottage to tell the Miss Dashwoods of the Miss
Steeles' arrival, and to assure them of their being the sweetest girls
in the world. From such commendation as this, however, there was not
much to be learned; Elinor well knew that the sweetest girls in the
world were to be met with in every part of England, under every
possible variation of form, face, temper and understanding. Sir John
wanted the whole family to walk to the Park directly and look at his (<font color='blue'><b>acquaintance</b></font>)
guests. Benevolent, philanthropic man! It was painful to him (<font color='blue'><b>acquaintance</b></font>) even to
keep a third cousin to himself.

<p/>When their promised visit to the Park and consequent introduction to
these young ladies took place, they found in the appearance of the
eldest, who was nearly thirty, with a very plain and not a sensible
face, nothing to admire; but in the other, who was not more than two or
three and twenty, they acknowledged considerable beauty; her (<font color='blue'><b>John</b></font>) features
were pretty, and she (<font color='blue'><b>John</b></font>) had a sharp quick eye, and a smartness of air,
which though it did not give actual elegance or grace, gave distinction
to her (<font color='blue'><b>John</b></font>) person.-- Their manners were particularly civil, and Elinor soon
allowed them credit for some kind of sense, when she (<font color='blue'><b>Elinor</b></font>) saw with what
constant and judicious attention they were making themselves agreeable
to Lady Middleton. With her (<font color='blue'><b>Middleton</b></font>) children they were in continual raptures,
extolling their beauty, courting their notice, and humouring their
whims; and such of their time as could be spared from the importunate
demands which this politeness made on it, was spent in admiration of
whatever her (<font color='blue'><b>Middleton</b></font>) ladyship was doing, if she (<font color='blue'><b>Middleton</b></font>) happened to be doing any thing,
or in taking patterns of some elegant new dress, in which her (<font color='blue'><b>Middleton</b></font>)
appearance the day before had thrown them into unceasing delight.
Fortunately for those who pay their court through such foibles, a fond
mother, though, in pursuit of praise for her (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) children, the most
rapacious of human beings, is likewise the most credulous; her (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) demands
are exorbitant; but she (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) will swallow any thing; and the excessive
affection and endurance of the Miss Steeles towards her (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) offspring were
viewed therefore by Lady Middleton without the smallest surprise or
distrust. She (<font color='blue'><b>Middleton</b></font>) saw with maternal complacency all the impertinent
encroachments and mischievous tricks to which her (<font color='blue'><b>Middleton</b></font>) cousins submitted.
She (<font color='blue'><b>Middleton</b></font>) saw their sashes untied, their hair pulled about their ears, their
work-bags searched, and their knives and scissors stolen away, and felt
no doubt of its being a reciprocal enjoyment. It suggested no other
surprise than that Elinor and Marianne should sit so composedly by,
without claiming a share in what was passing.

<p/>Marianne was silent; it was impossible for her (<font color='blue'><b>Marianne</b></font>) to say what she (<font color='blue'><b>Marianne</b></font>) did not
feel, however trivial the occasion; and upon Elinor therefore the whole
task of telling lies when politeness required it, always fell. She (<font color='blue'><b>Elinor</b></font>) did
her (<font color='blue'><b>Elinor</b></font>) best when thus called on, by speaking of Lady Middleton with more
warmth than she (<font color='blue'><b>Middleton</b></font>) felt, though with far less than Miss Lucy.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``I should guess so,''  (<font color='red'><b>Elinor/-- Elinor/ELINOR</b></font>)</div>said Elinor, with a smile, <div class="bookquote">``from what I have
witnessed this morning.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Elinor/-- Elinor/ELINOR</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I confess,''  (<font color='red'><b>Elinor/-- Elinor/ELINOR</b></font>)</div>replied Elinor, <div class="bookquote">``that while I am at Barton Park, I never
think of tame and quiet children with any abhorrence.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Elinor/-- Elinor/ELINOR</b></font>)</div><p/>In some surprise at the familiarity of this question, or at least of
the manner in which it was spoken, Elinor replied that she (<font color='blue'><b>Elinor</b></font>) was.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``I think every one MUST admire it,''  (<font color='red'><b>Elinor/-- Elinor/ELINOR</b></font>)</div>replied Elinor, <div class="bookquote">``who ever saw the
place; though it is not to be supposed that any one can estimate its
beauties as we do.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Elinor/-- Elinor/ELINOR</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Upon my word,''  (<font color='red'><b>Elinor/-- Elinor/ELINOR</b></font>)</div>replied Elinor, <div class="bookquote">``I cannot tell you, for I do not
perfectly comprehend the meaning of the word. But this I can say, that
if he (<font color='blue'><b>Barton</b></font>) ever was a beau before he (<font color='blue'><b>Barton</b></font>) married, he (<font color='blue'><b>Barton</b></font>) is one still for there is
not the smallest alteration in him (<font color='blue'><b>Barton</b></font>).''

 (<font color='red'><b>Elinor/-- Elinor/ELINOR</b></font>)</div><p/>This specimen of the Miss Steeles was enough. The vulgar freedom and
folly of the eldest left her (<font color='blue'><b>Elinor</b></font>) no recommendation, and as Elinor was not
blinded by the beauty, or the shrewd look of the youngest, to her (<font color='blue'><b>Elinor</b></font>) want
of real elegance and artlessness, she (<font color='blue'><b>Elinor</b></font>) left the house without any wish
of knowing them better.

<p/>Not so the Miss Steeles.--They came from Exeter, well provided with
admiration for the use of Sir John Middleton, his (<font color='blue'><b>Middleton</b></font>) family, and all his (<font color='blue'><b>Middleton</b></font>)
relations, and no niggardly proportion was now dealt out to his (<font color='blue'><b>Middleton</b></font>) fair
cousins, whom they declared to be the most beautiful, elegant,
accomplished, and agreeable girls they had ever beheld, and with whom
they were particularly anxious to be better acquainted.-- And to be
better acquainted therefore, Elinor soon found was their inevitable
lot, for as Sir John was entirely on the side of the Miss Steeles,
their party would be too strong for opposition, and that kind of
intimacy must be submitted to, which consists of sitting an hour or two
together in the same room almost every day. Sir John could do no more;
but he (<font color='blue'><b>party</b></font>) did not know that any more was required: to be together was, in
his (<font color='blue'><b>party</b></font>) opinion, to be intimate, and while his (<font color='blue'><b>party</b></font>) continual schemes for their
meeting were effectual, he (<font color='blue'><b>party</b></font>) had not a doubt of their being established
friends.

<p/>To do him (<font color='blue'><b>party</b></font>) justice, he (<font color='blue'><b>party</b></font>) did every thing in his (<font color='blue'><b>party</b></font>) power to promote their
unreserve, by making the Miss Steeles acquainted with whatever he (<font color='blue'><b>party</b></font>) knew
or supposed of his (<font color='blue'><b>party</b></font>) cousins' situations in the most delicate
particulars,--and Elinor had not seen them more than twice, before the
eldest of them wished her (<font color='blue'><b>Elinor</b></font>) joy on her (<font color='blue'><b>Elinor</b></font>) sister's having been so lucky as
to make a conquest of a very smart beau since she (<font color='blue'><b>Elinor</b></font>) came to Barton.

<p/>Elinor could not suppose that Sir John would be more nice in
proclaiming his (<font color='blue'><b>Barton</b></font>) suspicions of her (<font color='blue'><b>John</b></font>) regard for Edward, than he (<font color='blue'><b>Barton</b></font>) had been
with respect to Marianne; indeed it was rather his (<font color='blue'><b>Barton</b></font>) favourite joke of
the two, as being somewhat newer and more conjectural; and since
Edward's visit, they had never dined together without his (<font color='blue'><b>Edward</b></font>) drinking to
her (<font color='blue'><b>Marianne</b></font>) best affections with so much significancy and so many nods and
winks, as to excite general attention. The letter F--had been likewise
invariably brought forward, and found productive of such countless
jokes, that its character as the wittiest letter in the alphabet had
been long established with Elinor.

<p/>Elinor heard all this with attention and surprise. <div class="bookquote">``And who was this
uncle? Where did he (<font color='blue'><b>uncle</b></font>) live? How came they acquainted?''  (<font color='red'><b>She</b></font>)</div>She (<font color='blue'><b>Elinor</b></font>) wished very
much to have the subject continued, though she (<font color='blue'><b>Elinor</b></font>) did not chuse to join in
it herself; but nothing more of it was said, and for the first time in
her (<font color='blue'><b>Elinor</b></font>) life, she (<font color='blue'><b>Elinor</b></font>) thought Mrs. Jennings deficient either in curiosity after
petty information, or in a disposition to communicate it. The manner
in which Miss Steele had spoken of Edward, increased her (<font color='blue'><b>Steele</b></font>) curiosity; for
it struck her (<font color='blue'><b>Steele</b></font>) as being rather ill-natured, and suggested the suspicion
of that lady's knowing, or fancying herself to know something to his (<font color='blue'><b>Edward</b></font>)
disadvantage.--But her (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) curiosity was unavailing, for no farther notice
was taken of Mr. Ferrars's name by Miss Steele when alluded to, or even
openly mentioned by Sir John.

<p/>Marianne, who had never much toleration for any thing like
impertinence, vulgarity, inferiority of parts, or even difference of
taste from herself, was at this time particularly ill-disposed, from
the state of her (<font color='blue'><b>Marianne</b></font>) spirits, to be pleased with the Miss Steeles, or to
encourage their advances; and to the invariable coldness of her (<font color='blue'><b>Marianne</b></font>)
behaviour towards them, which checked every endeavour at intimacy on
their side, Elinor principally attributed that preference of herself
which soon became evident in the manners of both, but especially of
Lucy, who missed no opportunity of engaging her (<font color='blue'><b>Lucy</b></font>) in conversation, or of
striving to improve their acquaintance by an easy and frank
communication of her (<font color='blue'><b>Lucy</b></font>) sentiments.

<p/>Lucy was naturally clever; her (<font color='blue'><b>Lucy</b></font>) remarks were often just and amusing; and
as a companion for half an hour Elinor frequently found her (<font color='blue'><b>Elinor</b></font>) agreeable;
but her (<font color='blue'><b>Elinor</b></font>) powers had received no aid from education: she (<font color='blue'><b>Elinor</b></font>) was ignorant and
illiterate; and her (<font color='blue'><b>Elinor</b></font>) deficiency of all mental improvement, her (<font color='blue'><b>Elinor</b></font>) want of
information in the most common particulars, could not be concealed from
Miss Dashwood, in spite of her (<font color='blue'><b>Dashwood</b></font>) constant endeavour to appear to
advantage. Elinor saw, and pitied her (<font color='blue'><b>Elinor</b></font>) for, the neglect of abilities
which education might have rendered so respectable; but she (<font color='blue'><b>Elinor</b></font>) saw, with
less tenderness of feeling, the thorough want of delicacy, of
rectitude, and integrity of mind, which her (<font color='blue'><b>Elinor</b></font>) attentions, her (<font color='blue'><b>Elinor</b></font>)
assiduities, her (<font color='blue'><b>Elinor</b></font>) flatteries at the Park betrayed; and she (<font color='blue'><b>Elinor</b></font>) could have no
lasting satisfaction in the company of a person who joined insincerity
with ignorance; whose want of instruction prevented their meeting in
conversation on terms of equality, and whose conduct toward others made
every shew of attention and deference towards herself perfectly
valueless.

<p/>Elinor DID think the question a very odd one, and her (<font color='blue'><b>Elinor</b></font>) countenance
expressed it, as she (<font color='blue'><b>Elinor</b></font>) answered that she (<font color='blue'><b>Elinor</b></font>) had never seen Mrs. Ferrars.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``No,''  (<font color='red'><b>Elinor/-- Elinor/ELINOR</b></font>)</div>returned Elinor, cautious of giving her (<font color='blue'><b>Elinor</b></font>) real opinion of Edward's
mother, and not very desirous of satisfying what seemed impertinent
curiosity-- <div class="bookquote">``I know nothing of her (<font color='blue'><b>Barton</b></font>).''

 (<font color='red'><b>Edward mother</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I am sure you think me very strange, for enquiring about her (<font color='blue'><b>Barton</b></font>) in such a
way,''  (<font color='red'><b>Lucy/Lucy Steele</b></font>)</div>said Lucy, eyeing Elinor attentively as she (<font color='blue'><b>Elinor</b></font>) spoke; <div class="bookquote">``but perhaps
there may be reasons--I wish I might venture; but however I hope you
will do me the justice of believing that I do not mean to be
impertinent.''

 (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div><p/>Elinor made her (<font color='blue'><b>Elinor</b></font>) a civil reply, and they walked on for a few minutes in
silence. It was broken by Lucy, who renewed the subject again by
saying, with some hesitation,

<p/><div class="bookquote">``I am sorry I do NOT,''  (<font color='red'><b>Lucy/Lucy Steele</b></font>)</div>said Elinor, in great astonishment, <div class="bookquote">``if it could
be of any use to YOU to know my opinion of her (<font color='blue'><b>Barton</b></font>). But really I never
understood that you were at all connected with that family, and
therefore I am a little surprised, I confess, at so serious an inquiry
into her (<font color='blue'><b>Barton</b></font>) character.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Elinor/-- Elinor/ELINOR</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Good heavens!''  (<font color='red'><b>Elinor/-- Elinor/ELINOR</b></font>)</div>cried Elinor, <div class="bookquote">``what do you mean? Are you acquainted
with Mr. Robert Ferrars? Can you be?''  (<font color='red'><b>Elinor/-- Elinor/ELINOR</b></font>)</div>And she (<font color='blue'><b>Elinor</b></font>) did not feel much
delighted with the idea of such a sister-in-law.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``No,''  (<font color='red'><b>Lucy/Lucy Steele</b></font>)</div>replied Lucy, <div class="bookquote">``not to Mr. ROBERT Ferrars--I never saw him (<font color='blue'><b>Ferrars</b></font>) in my
life; but,''  (<font color='red'><b>Lucy/Lucy Steele</b></font>)</div>fixing her (<font color='blue'><b>Lucy</b></font>) eyes upon Elinor, <div class="bookquote">``to his (<font color='blue'><b>Ferrars</b></font>) eldest brother.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Elinor/-- Elinor/ELINOR</b></font>)</div><p/>What felt Elinor at that moment? Astonishment, that would have been as
painful as it was strong, had not an immediate disbelief of the
assertion attended it. She (<font color='blue'><b>Elinor</b></font>) turned towards Lucy in silent amazement,
unable to divine the reason or object of such a declaration; and though
her (<font color='blue'><b>Lucy</b></font>) complexion varied, she (<font color='blue'><b>Lucy</b></font>) stood firm in incredulity, and felt in no
danger of an hysterical fit, or a swoon.

<p/>Elinor for a few moments remained silent. Her (<font color='blue'><b>Elinor</b></font>) astonishment at what she (<font color='blue'><b>Elinor</b></font>)
heard was at first too great for words; but at length forcing herself
to speak, and to speak cautiously, she (<font color='blue'><b>Elinor</b></font>) said, with calmness of manner,
which tolerably well concealed her (<font color='blue'><b>Elinor</b></font>) surprise and solicitude-- <div class="bookquote">``May I ask
if your engagement is of long standing?''

 (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div><p/>Elinor, though greatly shocked, still felt unable to believe it.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``I think I have,''  (<font color='red'><b>Elinor/-- Elinor/ELINOR</b></font>)</div>replied Elinor, with an exertion of spirits, which
increased with her (<font color='blue'><b>Elinor</b></font>) increase of emotion.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Certainly,''  (<font color='red'><b>Elinor/-- Elinor/ELINOR</b></font>)</div>answered Elinor, without knowing what she (<font color='blue'><b>Elinor</b></font>) said; but after
a moment's reflection, she (<font color='blue'><b>Elinor</b></font>) added, with revived security of Edward's
honour and love, and her (<font color='blue'><b>Elinor</b></font>) companion's falsehood--<div class="bookquote">``Engaged to Mr. Edward
Ferrars!--I confess myself so totally surprised at what you tell me,
that really--I beg your pardon; but surely there must be some mistake
of person or name. We cannot mean the same Mr. Ferrars.''

 (<font color='red'><b>companion</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``It is strange,''  (<font color='red'><b>Elinor/-- Elinor/ELINOR</b></font>)</div>replied Elinor, in a most painful perplexity, <div class="bookquote">``that I
should never have heard him (<font color='blue'><b>Ferrars</b></font>) even mention your name.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Elinor/-- Elinor/ELINOR</b></font>)</div><p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>Elinor</b></font>) was silent.--Elinor's security sunk; but her (<font color='blue'><b>Elinor</b></font>) self-command did not
sink with it.

<p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>Elinor</b></font>) put it into her (<font color='blue'><b>Elinor</b></font>) hands as she (<font color='blue'><b>Elinor</b></font>) spoke; and when Elinor saw the
painting, whatever other doubts her (<font color='blue'><b>Elinor</b></font>) fear of a too hasty decision, or
her (<font color='blue'><b>Elinor</b></font>) wish of detecting falsehood might suffer to linger in her (<font color='blue'><b>Elinor</b></font>) mind, she (<font color='blue'><b>Elinor</b></font>)
could have none of its being Edward's face. She (<font color='blue'><b>Elinor</b></font>) returned it almost
instantly, acknowledging the likeness.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``You are quite in the right,''  (<font color='red'><b>Elinor/-- Elinor/ELINOR</b></font>)</div>replied Elinor calmly. They then
proceeded a few paces in silence. Lucy spoke first.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``I certainly did not seek your confidence,''  (<font color='red'><b>Elinor/-- Elinor/ELINOR</b></font>)</div>said Elinor; <div class="bookquote">``but you do me
no more than justice in imagining that I may be depended on. Your
secret is safe with me; but pardon me if I express some surprise at so
unnecessary a communication. You must at least have felt that my being
acquainted with it could not add to its safety.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Elinor/-- Elinor/ELINOR</b></font>)</div><p/>Here she (<font color='blue'><b>Elinor</b></font>) took out her (<font color='blue'><b>Elinor</b></font>) handkerchief; but Elinor did not feel very
compassionate.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Pardon me,''  (<font color='red'><b>Elinor/-- Elinor/ELINOR</b></font>)</div>replied Elinor, startled by the question; <div class="bookquote">``but I can give
you no advice under such circumstances. Your own judgment must direct
you.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Elinor/-- Elinor/ELINOR</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``No,''  (<font color='red'><b>Elinor/-- Elinor/ELINOR</b></font>)</div>replied Elinor, most feelingly sensible of every fresh
circumstance in favour of Lucy's veracity; <div class="bookquote">``I remember he (<font color='blue'><b>I</b></font>) told us, that
he (<font color='blue'><b>I</b></font>) had been staying a fortnight with some friends near Plymouth.''  (<font color='red'><b>Lucy/Lucy Steele</b></font>)</div>She (<font color='blue'><b>Elinor</b></font>)
remembered too, her (<font color='blue'><b>Elinor</b></font>) own surprise at the time, at his (<font color='blue'><b>Edward</b></font>) mentioning nothing
farther of those friends, at his (<font color='blue'><b>Edward</b></font>) total silence with respect even to
their names.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``I begged him (<font color='blue'><b>I</b></font>) to exert himself for fear you should suspect what was the
matter; but it made him (<font color='blue'><b>I</b></font>) so melancholy, not being able to stay more than
a fortnight with us, and seeing me so much affected.-- Poor fellow!--I
am afraid it is just the same with him (<font color='blue'><b>fellow</b></font>) now; for he (<font color='blue'><b>fellow</b></font>) writes in wretched
spirits. I heard from him (<font color='blue'><b>fellow</b></font>) just before I left Exeter;''  (<font color='red'><b>Elinor/-- Elinor/ELINOR</b></font>)</div>taking a letter
from her (<font color='blue'><b>Elinor</b></font>) pocket and carelessly showing the direction to Elinor. <div class="bookquote">``You
know his (<font color='blue'><b>fellow</b></font>) hand, I dare say, a charming one it is; but that is not
written so well as usual.--He (<font color='blue'><b>fellow</b></font>) was tired, I dare say, for he (<font color='blue'><b>fellow</b></font>) had just
filled the sheet to me as full as possible.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Elinor/-- Elinor/ELINOR</b></font>)</div><p/>Elinor saw that it WAS his (<font color='blue'><b>Edward</b></font>) hand, and she (<font color='blue'><b>Elinor</b></font>) could doubt no longer. This
picture, she (<font color='blue'><b>Elinor</b></font>) had allowed herself to believe, might have been
accidentally obtained; it might not have been Edward's gift; but a
correspondence between them by letter, could subsist only under a
positive engagement, could be authorised by nothing else; for a few
moments, she (<font color='blue'><b>Elinor</b></font>) was almost overcome--her (<font color='blue'><b>Elinor</b></font>) heart sunk within her (<font color='blue'><b>Elinor</b></font>), and she (<font color='blue'><b>Elinor</b></font>)
could hardly stand; but exertion was indispensably necessary; and she (<font color='blue'><b>Elinor</b></font>)
struggled so resolutely against the oppression of her (<font color='blue'><b>Elinor</b></font>) feelings, that
her (<font color='blue'><b>Elinor</b></font>) success was speedy, and for the time complete.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``I did,''  (<font color='red'><b>Elinor/-- Elinor/ELINOR</b></font>)</div>said Elinor, with a composure of voice, under which was
concealed an emotion and distress beyond any thing she (<font color='blue'><b>Elinor</b></font>) had ever felt
before. She (<font color='blue'><b>Elinor</b></font>) was mortified, shocked, confounded.

<p/>Fortunately for her (<font color='blue'><b>Elinor</b></font>), they had now reached the cottage, and the
conversation could be continued no farther. After sitting with them a
few minutes, the Miss Steeles returned to the Park, and Elinor was then
at liberty to think and be wretched.

<p/>However small Elinor's general dependence on Lucy's veracity might be,
it was impossible for her (<font color='blue'><b>Elinor</b></font>) on serious reflection to suspect it in the
present case, where no temptation could be answerable to the folly of
inventing a falsehood of such a description. What Lucy had asserted to
be true, therefore, Elinor could not, dared not longer doubt; supported
as it was too on every side by such probabilities and proofs, and
contradicted by nothing but her (<font color='blue'><b>Elinor</b></font>) own wishes. Their opportunity of
acquaintance in the house of Mr. Pratt was a foundation for the rest,
at once indisputable and alarming; and Edward's visit near Plymouth,
his (<font color='blue'><b>Edward</b></font>) melancholy state of mind, his (<font color='blue'><b>Edward</b></font>) dissatisfaction at his (<font color='blue'><b>Edward</b></font>) own prospects,
his (<font color='blue'><b>Edward</b></font>) uncertain behaviour towards herself, the intimate knowledge of the
Miss Steeles as to Norland and their family connections, which had
often surprised her (<font color='blue'><b>Steeles</b></font>), the picture, the letter, the ring, formed
altogether such a body of evidence, as overcame every fear of
condemning him (<font color='blue'><b>Edward</b></font>) unfairly, and established as a fact, which no partiality
could set aside, his (<font color='blue'><b>Edward</b></font>) ill-treatment of herself.--Her (<font color='blue'><b>Steeles</b></font>) resentment of such
behaviour, her (<font color='blue'><b>Steeles</b></font>) indignation at having been its dupe, for a short time
made her (<font color='blue'><b>Steeles</b></font>) feel only for herself; but other ideas, other considerations,
soon arose. Had Edward been intentionally deceiving her (<font color='blue'><b>Steeles</b></font>)? Had he (<font color='blue'><b>Edward</b></font>)
feigned a regard for her (<font color='blue'><b>Steeles</b></font>) which he (<font color='blue'><b>Edward</b></font>) did not feel? Was his (<font color='blue'><b>Edward</b></font>) engagement to
Lucy an engagement of the heart? No; whatever it might once have been,
she (<font color='blue'><b>Lucy</b></font>) could not believe it such at present. His (<font color='blue'><b>Edward</b></font>) affection was all her (<font color='blue'><b>Lucy</b></font>)
own. She (<font color='blue'><b>Lucy</b></font>) could not be deceived in that. Her (<font color='blue'><b>Lucy</b></font>) mother, sisters, Fanny,
all had been conscious of his (<font color='blue'><b>Edward</b></font>) regard for her (<font color='blue'><b>Lucy</b></font>) at Norland; it was not an
illusion of her (<font color='blue'><b>Lucy</b></font>) own vanity. He (<font color='blue'><b>Edward</b></font>) certainly loved her (<font color='blue'><b>Lucy</b></font>). What a softener
of the heart was this persuasion! How much could it not tempt her (<font color='blue'><b>Lucy</b></font>) to
forgive! He (<font color='blue'><b>Edward</b></font>) had been blamable, highly blamable, in remaining at
Norland after he (<font color='blue'><b>Edward</b></font>) first felt her (<font color='blue'><b>Lucy</b></font>) influence over him (<font color='blue'><b>Edward</b></font>) to be more than it
ought to be. In that, he (<font color='blue'><b>Edward</b></font>) could not be defended; but if he (<font color='blue'><b>Edward</b></font>) had injured
her (<font color='blue'><b>Lucy</b></font>), how much more had he (<font color='blue'><b>Edward</b></font>) injured himself; if her (<font color='blue'><b>Lucy</b></font>) case were pitiable,
his (<font color='blue'><b>Edward</b></font>) was hopeless. His (<font color='blue'><b>Edward</b></font>) imprudence had made her (<font color='blue'><b>Lucy</b></font>) miserable for a while;
but it seemed to have deprived himself of all chance of ever being
otherwise. She (<font color='blue'><b>Lucy</b></font>) might in time regain tranquillity; but HE (<font color='blue'><b>Edward</b></font>), what had he (<font color='blue'><b>Edward</b></font>)
to look forward to? Could he (<font color='blue'><b>Edward</b></font>) ever be tolerably happy with Lucy Steele;
could he (<font color='blue'><b>Edward</b></font>), were his (<font color='blue'><b>Edward</b></font>) affection for herself out of the question, with his (<font color='blue'><b>Edward</b></font>)
integrity, his (<font color='blue'><b>Edward</b></font>) delicacy, and well-informed mind, be satisfied with a
wife like her (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>)--illiterate, artful, and selfish?

<p/>As these considerations occurred to her (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>) in painful succession, she (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>) wept
for him (<font color='blue'><b>Edward</b></font>), more than for herself. Supported by the conviction of having
done nothing to merit her (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>) present unhappiness, and consoled by the
belief that Edward had done nothing to forfeit her (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>) esteem, she (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>) thought
she (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>) could even now, under the first smart of the heavy blow, command
herself enough to guard every suspicion of the truth from her (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>) mother
and sisters. And so well was she (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>) able to answer her (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>) own expectations,
that when she (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>) joined them at dinner only two hours after she (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>) had first
suffered the extinction of all her (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>) dearest hopes, no one would have
supposed from the appearance of the sisters, that Elinor was mourning
in secret over obstacles which must divide her (<font color='blue'><b>Elinor</b></font>) for ever from the object
of her (<font color='blue'><b>Elinor</b></font>) love, and that Marianne was internally dwelling on the
perfections of a man, of whose whole heart she (<font color='blue'><b>Marianne</b></font>) felt thoroughly
possessed, and whom she (<font color='blue'><b>Marianne</b></font>) expected to see in every carriage which drove
near their house.

<p/>The necessity of concealing from her (<font color='blue'><b>Marianne</b></font>) mother and Marianne, what had been
entrusted in confidence to herself, though it obliged her (<font color='blue'><b>Marianne</b></font>) to unceasing
exertion, was no aggravation of Elinor's distress. On the contrary it
was a relief to her (<font color='blue'><b>Elinor</b></font>), to be spared the communication of what would give
such affliction to them, and to be saved likewise from hearing that
condemnation of Edward, which would probably flow from the excess of
their partial affection for herself, and which was more than she (<font color='blue'><b>Elinor</b></font>) felt
equal to support.

<p/>Much as she (<font color='blue'><b>Elinor</b></font>) had suffered from her (<font color='blue'><b>Elinor</b></font>) first conversation with Lucy on the
subject, she (<font color='blue'><b>Elinor</b></font>) soon felt an earnest wish of renewing it; and this for
more reasons than one. She (<font color='blue'><b>Elinor</b></font>) wanted to hear many particulars of their
engagement repeated again, she (<font color='blue'><b>Elinor</b></font>) wanted more clearly to understand what
Lucy really felt for Edward, whether there were any sincerity in her (<font color='blue'><b>Lucy</b></font>)
declaration of tender regard for him (<font color='blue'><b>Edward</b></font>), and she (<font color='blue'><b>Lucy</b></font>) particularly wanted to
convince Lucy, by her (<font color='blue'><b>Lucy</b></font>) readiness to enter on the matter again, and her (<font color='blue'><b>Lucy</b></font>)
calmness in conversing on it, that she (<font color='blue'><b>Lucy</b></font>) was no otherwise interested in
it than as a friend, which she (<font color='blue'><b>Lucy</b></font>) very much feared her (<font color='blue'><b>Lucy</b></font>) involuntary
agitation, in their morning discourse, must have left at least
doubtful. That Lucy was disposed to be jealous of her (<font color='blue'><b>Lucy</b></font>) appeared very
probable: it was plain that Edward had always spoken highly in her (<font color='blue'><b>Lucy</b></font>)
praise, not merely from Lucy's assertion, but from her (<font color='blue'><b>Lucy</b></font>) venturing to
trust her (<font color='blue'><b>Lucy</b></font>) on so short a personal acquaintance, with a secret so
confessedly and evidently important. And even Sir John's joking
intelligence must have had some weight. But indeed, while Elinor
remained so well assured within herself of being really beloved by
Edward, it required no other consideration of probabilities to make it
natural that Lucy should be jealous; and that she (<font color='blue'><b>Lucy</b></font>) was so, her (<font color='blue'><b>Lucy</b></font>) very
confidence was a proof. What other reason for the disclosure of the
affair could there be, but that Elinor might be informed by it of
Lucy's superior claims on Edward, and be taught to avoid him (<font color='blue'><b>Edward</b></font>) in future?
She (<font color='blue'><b>Lucy</b></font>) had little difficulty in understanding thus much of her (<font color='blue'><b>Lucy</b></font>) rival's
intentions, and while she (<font color='blue'><b>Lucy</b></font>) was firmly resolved to act by her (<font color='blue'><b>Lucy</b></font>) as every
principle of honour and honesty directed, to combat her (<font color='blue'><b>Lucy</b></font>) own affection
for Edward and to see him (<font color='blue'><b>Edward</b></font>) as little as possible; she (<font color='blue'><b>Lucy</b></font>) could not deny
herself the comfort of endeavouring to convince Lucy that her (<font color='blue'><b>Lucy</b></font>) heart was
unwounded. And as she (<font color='blue'><b>Lucy</b></font>) could now have nothing more painful to hear on
the subject than had already been told, she (<font color='blue'><b>Lucy</b></font>) did not mistrust her (<font color='blue'><b>Lucy</b></font>) own
ability of going through a repetition of particulars with composure.

<p/>One or two meetings of this kind had taken place, without affording
Elinor any chance of engaging Lucy in private, when Sir John called at
the cottage one morning, to beg, in the name of charity, that they
would all dine with Lady Middleton that day, as he (<font color='blue'><b>Lucy</b></font>) was obliged to
attend the club at Exeter, and she (<font color='blue'><b>Middleton</b></font>) would otherwise be quite alone,
except her (<font color='blue'><b>Middleton</b></font>) mother and the two Miss Steeles. Elinor, who foresaw a
fairer opening for the point she (<font color='blue'><b>Elinor</b></font>) had in view, in such a party as this
was likely to be, more at liberty among themselves under the tranquil
and well-bred direction of Lady Middleton than when her (<font color='blue'><b>Middleton</b></font>) husband united
them together in one noisy purpose, immediately accepted the
invitation; Margaret, with her (<font color='blue'><b>Margaret</b></font>) mother's permission, was equally
compliant, and Marianne, though always unwilling to join any of their
parties, was persuaded by her (<font color='blue'><b>Marianne</b></font>) mother, who could not bear to have her (<font color='blue'><b>Marianne</b></font>)
seclude herself from any chance of amusement, to go likewise.

<p/>The young ladies went, and Lady Middleton was happily preserved from
the frightful solitude which had threatened her (<font color='blue'><b>Middleton</b></font>). The insipidity of the
meeting was exactly such as Elinor had expected; it produced not one
novelty of thought or expression, and nothing could be less interesting
than the whole of their discourse both in the dining parlour and
drawing room: to the latter, the children accompanied them, and while
they remained there, she (<font color='blue'><b>Elinor</b></font>) was too well convinced of the impossibility of
engaging Lucy's attention to attempt it. They quitted it only with the
removal of the tea-things. The card-table was then placed, and Elinor
began to wonder at herself for having ever entertained a hope of
finding time for conversation at the park. They all rose up in
preparation for a round game.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Marianne can never keep long from that instrument you know, ma'am,''
 (<font color='red'><b>Elinor/-- Elinor/ELINOR</b></font>)</div>said Elinor, endeavouring to smooth away the offence; <div class="bookquote">``and I do not
much wonder at it; for it is the very best toned piano-forte I ever
heard.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Elinor/-- Elinor/ELINOR</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Perhaps,''  (<font color='red'><b>Elinor/-- Elinor/ELINOR</b></font>)</div>continued Elinor, <div class="bookquote">``if I should happen to cut out, I may be
of some use to Miss Lucy Steele, in rolling her (<font color='blue'><b>Lucy</b></font>) papers for her (<font color='blue'><b>Lucy</b></font>); and
there is so much still to be done to the basket, that it must be
impossible I think for her (<font color='blue'><b>Lucy</b></font>) labour singly, to finish it this evening. I
should like the work exceedingly, if she (<font color='blue'><b>Lucy</b></font>) would allow me a share in it.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Elinor/-- Elinor/ELINOR</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``You are very kind,''  (<font color='red'><b>Lady Middleton/Middleton</b></font>)</div>said Lady Middleton to Elinor; <div class="bookquote">``and as you really
like the work, perhaps you will be as well pleased not to cut in till
another rubber, or will you take your chance now?''

 (<font color='red'><b>Elinor/-- Elinor/ELINOR</b></font>)</div><p/>Elinor joyfully profited by the first of these proposals, and thus by a
little of that address which Marianne could never condescend to
practise, gained her (<font color='blue'><b>Marianne</b></font>) own end, and pleased Lady Middleton at the same
time. Lucy made room for her (<font color='blue'><b>Lucy</b></font>) with ready attention, and the two fair
rivals were thus seated side by side at the same table, and, with the
utmost harmony, engaged in forwarding the same work. The pianoforte at
which Marianne, wrapped up in her (<font color='blue'><b>Marianne</b></font>) own music and her (<font color='blue'><b>Marianne</b></font>) own thoughts, had
by this time forgotten that any body was in the room besides herself,
was luckily so near them that Miss Dashwood now judged she (<font color='blue'><b>Dashwood</b></font>) might
safely, under the shelter of its noise, introduce the interesting
subject, without any risk of being heard at the card-table.

<p/>In a firm, though cautious tone, Elinor thus began.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Offended me! How could you suppose so? Believe me,''  (<font color='red'><b>Elinor/-- Elinor/ELINOR</b></font>)</div>and Elinor spoke
it with the truest sincerity, <div class="bookquote">``nothing could be farther from my
intention than to give you such an idea. Could you have a motive for
the trust, that was not honourable and flattering to me?''

 (<font color='red'><b>Elinor/-- Elinor/ELINOR</b></font>)</div><p/>Lucy here looked up; but Elinor was careful in guarding her (<font color='blue'><b>Elinor</b></font>) countenance
from every expression that could give her (<font color='blue'><b>Elinor</b></font>) words a suspicious tendency.

<p/>Elinor hardly knew whether to smile or sigh at this assertion.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``All this,''  (<font color='red'><b>Elinor/-- Elinor/ELINOR</b></font>)</div>thought Elinor, <div class="bookquote">``is very pretty; but it can impose upon
neither of us.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Elinor/-- Elinor/ELINOR</b></font>)</div><p/>Lucy looked at Elinor again, and was silent.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Do you know Mr. Robert Ferrars?''  (<font color='red'><b>Elinor/-- Elinor/ELINOR</b></font>)</div>asked Elinor.

<p/>Elinor blushed in spite of herself. Lucy bit her (<font color='blue'><b>Elinor</b></font>) lip, and looked
angrily at her (<font color='blue'><b>Elinor</b></font>) sister. A mutual silence took place for some time.
Lucy first put an end to it by saying in a lower tone, though Marianne
was then giving them the powerful protection of a very magnificent
concerto--

<p/><div class="bookquote">``I should always be happy,''  (<font color='red'><b>Marianne/Miss Marianne</b></font>)</div>replied Elinor, <div class="bookquote">``to show any mark of my
esteem and friendship for Mr. Ferrars; but do you not perceive that my
interest on such an occasion would be perfectly unnecessary? He (<font color='blue'><b>Ferrars</b></font>) is
brother to Mrs. John Dashwood--THAT must be recommendation enough to
her (<font color='blue'><b>Dashwood</b></font>) husband.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Elinor/-- Elinor/ELINOR</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``No,''  (<font color='red'><b>Elinor/-- Elinor/ELINOR</b></font>)</div>answered Elinor, with a smile, which concealed very agitated
feelings, <div class="bookquote">``on such a subject I certainly will not. You know very well
that my opinion would have no weight with you, unless it were on the
side of your wishes.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Elinor/-- Elinor/ELINOR</b></font>)</div><p/>Elinor blushed for the insincerity of Edward's future wife, and
replied, <div class="bookquote">``This compliment would effectually frighten me from giving any
opinion on the subject had I formed one. It raises my influence much
too high; the power of dividing two people so tenderly attached is too
much for an indifferent person.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Edward wife</b></font>)</div><p/>Elinor thought it wisest to make no answer to this, lest they might
provoke each other to an unsuitable increase of ease and unreserve; and
was even partly determined never to mention the subject again. Another
pause therefore of many minutes' duration, succeeded this speech, and
Lucy was still the first to end it.

<p/>Elinor was soon called to the card-table by the conclusion of the first
rubber, and the confidential discourse of the two ladies was therefore
at an end, to which both of them submitted without any reluctance, for
nothing had been said on either side to make them dislike each other
less than they had done before; and Elinor sat down to the card table
with the melancholy persuasion that Edward was not only without
affection for the person who was to be his (<font color='blue'><b>Edward</b></font>) wife; but that he (<font color='blue'><b>Edward</b></font>) had not
even the chance of being tolerably happy in marriage, which sincere
affection on HER side would have given, for self-interest alone could
induce a woman to keep a man to an engagement, of which she (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) seemed so
thoroughly aware that he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) was weary.

<p/>From this time the subject was never revived by Elinor, and when
entered on by Lucy, who seldom missed an opportunity of introducing it,
and was particularly careful to inform her (<font color='blue'><b>Elinor</b></font>) confidante, of her (<font color='blue'><b>Elinor</b></font>) happiness
whenever she (<font color='blue'><b>Elinor</b></font>) received a letter from Edward, it was treated by the
former with calmness and caution, and dismissed as soon as civility
would allow; for she (<font color='blue'><b>Elinor</b></font>) felt such conversations to be an indulgence which
Lucy did not deserve, and which were dangerous to herself.

<p/>Though Mrs. Jennings was in the habit of spending a large portion of
the year at the houses of her (<font color='blue'><b>Jennings</b></font>) children and friends, she (<font color='blue'><b>Jennings</b></font>) was not without
a settled habitation of her (<font color='blue'><b>Jennings</b></font>) own. Since the death of her (<font color='blue'><b>Jennings</b></font>) husband, who
had traded with success in a less elegant part of the town, she (<font color='blue'><b>Jennings</b></font>) had
resided every winter in a house in one of the streets near Portman
Square. Towards this home, she (<font color='blue'><b>Jennings</b></font>) began on the approach of January to
turn her (<font color='blue'><b>Jennings</b></font>) thoughts, and thither she (<font color='blue'><b>Jennings</b></font>) one day abruptly, and very
unexpectedly by them, asked the elder Misses Dashwood to accompany her (<font color='blue'><b>Dashwood</b></font>).
Elinor, without observing the varying complexion of her (<font color='blue'><b>Elinor</b></font>) sister, and the
animated look which spoke no indifference to the plan, immediately gave
a grateful but absolute denial for both, in which she (<font color='blue'><b>Elinor</b></font>) believed herself
to be speaking their united inclinations. The reason alleged was their
determined resolution of not leaving their mother at that time of the
year. Mrs. Jennings received the refusal with some surprise, and
repeated her (<font color='blue'><b>Jennings</b></font>) invitation immediately.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``I thank you, ma'am, sincerely thank you,''  (<font color='red'><b>Marianne/Miss Marianne</b></font>)</div>said Marianne, with warmth:
<div class="bookquote">``your invitation has insured my gratitude for ever, and it would give
me such happiness, yes, almost the greatest happiness I am capable of,
to be able to accept it. But my mother, my dearest, kindest mother,--I
feel the justice of what Elinor has urged, and if she (<font color='blue'><b>Elinor</b></font>) were to be made
less happy, less comfortable by our absence--Oh! no, nothing should
tempt me to leave her (<font color='blue'><b>Elinor</b></font>). It should not, must not be a struggle.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Marianne/Miss Marianne</b></font>)</div><p/>Mrs. Jennings repeated her (<font color='blue'><b>Jennings</b></font>) assurance that Mrs. Dashwood could spare
them perfectly well; and Elinor, who now understood her (<font color='blue'><b>Elinor</b></font>) sister, and saw
to what indifference to almost every thing else she (<font color='blue'><b>Elinor</b></font>) was carried by her (<font color='blue'><b>Elinor</b></font>)
eagerness to be with Willoughby again, made no farther direct
opposition to the plan, and merely referred it to her (<font color='blue'><b>Elinor</b></font>) mother's
decision, from whom however she (<font color='blue'><b>Elinor</b></font>) scarcely expected to receive any
support in her (<font color='blue'><b>Elinor</b></font>) endeavour to prevent a visit, which she (<font color='blue'><b>Elinor</b></font>) could not
approve of for Marianne, and which on her (<font color='blue'><b>Marianne</b></font>) own account she (<font color='blue'><b>Marianne</b></font>) had
particular reasons to avoid. Whatever Marianne was desirous of, her (<font color='blue'><b>Marianne</b></font>)
mother would be eager to promote--she (<font color='blue'><b>Marianne</b></font>) could not expect to influence the
latter to cautiousness of conduct in an affair respecting which she (<font color='blue'><b>Marianne</b></font>) had
never been able to inspire her (<font color='blue'><b>Marianne</b></font>) with distrust; and she (<font color='blue'><b>Marianne</b></font>) dared not explain
the motive of her (<font color='blue'><b>Marianne</b></font>) own disinclination for going to London. That
Marianne, fastidious as she (<font color='blue'><b>Marianne</b></font>) was, thoroughly acquainted with Mrs.
Jennings' manners, and invariably disgusted by them, should overlook
every inconvenience of that kind, should disregard whatever must be
most wounding to her (<font color='blue'><b>Jennings</b></font>) irritable feelings, in her (<font color='blue'><b>Jennings</b></font>) pursuit of one object,
was such a proof, so strong, so full, of the importance of that object
to her (<font color='blue'><b>Jennings</b></font>), as Elinor, in spite of all that had passed, was not prepared to
witness.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Though with your usual anxiety for our happiness,''  (<font color='red'><b>Elinor/-- Elinor/ELINOR</b></font>)</div>said Elinor, <div class="bookquote">``you
have been obviating every impediment to the present scheme which
occurred to you, there is still one objection which, in my opinion,
cannot be so easily removed.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Elinor/-- Elinor/ELINOR</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``And what,''  (<font color='red'><b>Mrs. Dashwood/John/Mrs. John Dashwood</b></font>)</div>said Mrs. Dashwood, <div class="bookquote">``is my dear prudent Elinor going to
suggest? What formidable obstacle is she (<font color='blue'><b>Elinor</b></font>) now to bring forward? Do let
me hear a word about the expense of it.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Mrs. Dashwood/John/Mrs. John Dashwood</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``If Elinor is frightened away by her (<font color='blue'><b>Elinor</b></font>) dislike of Mrs. Jennings,''  (<font color='red'><b>Marianne/Miss Marianne</b></font>)</div>said
Marianne, <div class="bookquote">``at least it need not prevent MY accepting her (<font color='blue'><b>MY</b></font>) invitation. I
have no such scruples, and I am sure I could put up with every
unpleasantness of that kind with very little effort.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Marianne/Miss Marianne</b></font>)</div><p/>Elinor could not help smiling at this display of indifference towards
the manners of a person, to whom she (<font color='blue'><b>Elinor</b></font>) had often had difficulty in
persuading Marianne to behave with tolerable politeness; and resolved
within herself, that if her (<font color='blue'><b>Marianne</b></font>) sister persisted in going, she (<font color='blue'><b>Marianne</b></font>) would go
likewise, as she (<font color='blue'><b>Marianne</b></font>) did not think it proper that Marianne should be left
to the sole guidance of her (<font color='blue'><b>Marianne</b></font>) own judgment, or that Mrs. Jennings should
be abandoned to the mercy of Marianne for all the comfort of her (<font color='blue'><b>Marianne</b></font>)
domestic hours. To this determination she (<font color='blue'><b>Marianne</b></font>) was the more easily
reconciled, by recollecting that Edward Ferrars, by Lucy's account, was
not to be in town before February; and that their visit, without any
unreasonable abridgement, might be previously finished.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``I will have you BOTH go,''  (<font color='red'><b>Mrs. Dashwood/John/Mrs. John Dashwood</b></font>)</div>said Mrs. Dashwood; <div class="bookquote">``these objections are
nonsensical. You will have much pleasure in being in London, and
especially in being together; and if Elinor would ever condescend to
anticipate enjoyment, she (<font color='blue'><b>Elinor</b></font>) would foresee it there from a variety of
sources; she (<font color='blue'><b>Elinor</b></font>) would, perhaps, expect some from improving her (<font color='blue'><b>Elinor</b></font>)
acquaintance with her (<font color='blue'><b>Elinor</b></font>) sister-in-law's family.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Mrs. Dashwood/John/Mrs. John Dashwood</b></font>)</div><p/>Elinor had often wished for an opportunity of attempting to weaken her (<font color='blue'><b>Elinor</b></font>)
mother's dependence on the attachment of Edward and herself, that the
shock might be less when the whole truth were revealed, and now on this
attack, though almost hopeless of success, she (<font color='blue'><b>Elinor</b></font>) forced herself to begin
her (<font color='blue'><b>Elinor</b></font>) design by saying, as calmly as she (<font color='blue'><b>Elinor</b></font>) could, <div class="bookquote">``I like Edward Ferrars
very much, and shall always be glad to see him (<font color='blue'><b>Ferrars</b></font>); but as to the rest of
the family, it is a matter of perfect indifference to me, whether I am
ever known to them or not.''

 (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div><p/>Mrs. Dashwood smiled, and said nothing. Marianne lifted up her (<font color='blue'><b>Marianne</b></font>) eyes in
astonishment, and Elinor conjectured that she (<font color='blue'><b>Elinor</b></font>) might as well have held
her (<font color='blue'><b>Elinor</b></font>) tongue.

<p/>Elinor submitted to the arrangement which counteracted her (<font color='blue'><b>Elinor</b></font>) wishes with
less reluctance than she (<font color='blue'><b>Elinor</b></font>) had expected to feel. With regard to herself,
it was now a matter of unconcern whether she (<font color='blue'><b>Elinor</b></font>) went to town or not, and
when she (<font color='blue'><b>Elinor</b></font>) saw her (<font color='blue'><b>Elinor</b></font>) mother so thoroughly pleased with the plan, and her (<font color='blue'><b>Elinor</b></font>)
sister exhilarated by it in look, voice, and manner, restored to all
her (<font color='blue'><b>Elinor</b></font>) usual animation, and elevated to more than her (<font color='blue'><b>Elinor</b></font>) usual gaiety, she (<font color='blue'><b>Elinor</b></font>)
could not be dissatisfied with the cause, and would hardly allow
herself to distrust the consequence.

<p/>Marianne's joy was almost a degree beyond happiness, so great was the
perturbation of her (<font color='blue'><b>Marianne</b></font>) spirits and her (<font color='blue'><b>Marianne</b></font>) impatience to be gone. Her (<font color='blue'><b>Marianne</b></font>)
unwillingness to quit her (<font color='blue'><b>Marianne</b></font>) mother was her (<font color='blue'><b>Marianne</b></font>) only restorative to calmness;
and at the moment of parting her (<font color='blue'><b>Marianne</b></font>) grief on that score was excessive.
Her (<font color='blue'><b>Marianne</b></font>) mother's affliction was hardly less, and Elinor was the only one of
the three, who seemed to consider the separation as any thing short of
eternal.

<p/>Elinor could not find herself in the carriage with Mrs. Jennings, and
beginning a journey to London under her (<font color='blue'><b>Elinor</b></font>) protection, and as her (<font color='blue'><b>Elinor</b></font>) guest,
without wondering at her (<font color='blue'><b>Elinor</b></font>) own situation, so short had their acquaintance
with that lady been, so wholly unsuited were they in age and
disposition, and so many had been her (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) objections against such a measure
only a few days before! But these objections had all, with that happy
ardour of youth which Marianne and her (<font color='blue'><b>Marianne</b></font>) mother equally shared, been
overcome or overlooked; and Elinor, in spite of every occasional doubt
of Willoughby's constancy, could not witness the rapture of delightful
expectation which filled the whole soul and beamed in the eyes of
Marianne, without feeling how blank was her (<font color='blue'><b>Marianne</b></font>) own prospect, how cheerless
her (<font color='blue'><b>Marianne</b></font>) own state of mind in the comparison, and how gladly she (<font color='blue'><b>Marianne</b></font>) would
engage in the solicitude of Marianne's situation to have the same
animating object in view, the same possibility of hope. A short, a
very short time however must now decide what Willoughby's intentions
were; in all probability he (<font color='blue'><b>Willoughby</b></font>) was already in town. Marianne's eagerness
to be gone declared her (<font color='blue'><b>Marianne</b></font>) dependence on finding him (<font color='blue'><b>Willoughby</b></font>) there; and Elinor was
resolved not only upon gaining every new light as to his (<font color='blue'><b>Willoughby</b></font>) character
which her (<font color='blue'><b>Elinor</b></font>) own observation or the intelligence of others could give her (<font color='blue'><b>Elinor</b></font>),
but likewise upon watching his (<font color='blue'><b>Willoughby</b></font>) behaviour to her (<font color='blue'><b>Elinor</b></font>) sister with such
zealous attention, as to ascertain what he (<font color='blue'><b>Willoughby</b></font>) was and what he (<font color='blue'><b>Willoughby</b></font>) meant,
before many meetings had taken place. Should the result of her (<font color='blue'><b>Elinor</b></font>)
observations be unfavourable, she (<font color='blue'><b>Elinor</b></font>) was determined at all events to open
the eyes of her (<font color='blue'><b>Elinor</b></font>) sister; should it be otherwise, her (<font color='blue'><b>Elinor</b></font>) exertions would be
of a different nature--she (<font color='blue'><b>Elinor</b></font>) must then learn to avoid every selfish
comparison, and banish every regret which might lessen her (<font color='blue'><b>Elinor</b></font>) satisfaction
in the happiness of Marianne.

<p/>They were three days on their journey, and Marianne's behaviour as they
travelled was a happy specimen of what future complaisance and
companionableness to Mrs. Jennings might be expected to be. She (<font color='blue'><b>Jennings</b></font>) sat in
silence almost all the way, wrapt in her (<font color='blue'><b>Jennings</b></font>) own meditations, and scarcely
ever voluntarily speaking, except when any object of picturesque beauty
within their view drew from her (<font color='blue'><b>Jennings</b></font>) an exclamation of delight exclusively
addressed to her (<font color='blue'><b>Jennings</b></font>) sister. To atone for this conduct therefore, Elinor
took immediate possession of the post of civility which she (<font color='blue'><b>Elinor</b></font>) had
assigned herself, behaved with the greatest attention to Mrs. Jennings,
talked with her (<font color='blue'><b>Jennings</b></font>), laughed with her (<font color='blue'><b>Jennings</b></font>), and listened to her (<font color='blue'><b>Jennings</b></font>) whenever she (<font color='blue'><b>Jennings</b></font>)
could; and Mrs. Jennings on her (<font color='blue'><b>Jennings</b></font>) side treated them both with all
possible kindness, was solicitous on every occasion for their ease and
enjoyment, and only disturbed that she (<font color='blue'><b>Jennings</b></font>) could not make them choose their
own dinners at the inn, nor extort a confession of their preferring
salmon to cod, or boiled fowls to veal cutlets. They reached town by
three o'clock the third day, glad to be released, after such a journey,
from the confinement of a carriage, and ready to enjoy all the luxury
of a good fire.

<p/>As dinner was not to be ready in less than two hours from their
arrival, Elinor determined to employ the interval in writing to her (<font color='blue'><b>Elinor</b></font>)
mother, and sat down for that purpose. In a few moments Marianne did
the same. <div class="bookquote">``I am writing home, Marianne,''  (<font color='red'><b>Elinor/-- Elinor/ELINOR</b></font>)</div>said Elinor; <div class="bookquote">``had not you
better defer your letter for a day or two?''

 (<font color='red'><b>Elinor/-- Elinor/ELINOR</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I am NOT going to write to my mother,''  (<font color='red'><b>Marianne/Miss Marianne</b></font>)</div>replied Marianne, hastily, and
as if wishing to avoid any farther inquiry. Elinor said no more; it
immediately struck her (<font color='blue'><b>Elinor</b></font>) that she (<font color='blue'><b>Elinor</b></font>) must then be writing to Willoughby; and
the conclusion which as instantly followed was, that, however
mysteriously they might wish to conduct the affair, they must be
engaged. This conviction, though not entirely satisfactory, gave her (<font color='blue'><b>Elinor</b></font>)
pleasure, and she (<font color='blue'><b>Elinor</b></font>) continued her (<font color='blue'><b>Elinor</b></font>) letter with greater alacrity.
Marianne's was finished in a very few minutes; in length it could be no
more than a note; it was then folded up, sealed, and directed with
eager rapidity. Elinor thought she (<font color='blue'><b>Elinor</b></font>) could distinguish a large W in the
direction; and no sooner was it complete than Marianne, ringing the
bell, requested the footman who answered it to get that letter conveyed
for her (<font color='blue'><b>Marianne</b></font>) to the two-penny post. This decided the matter at once.

<p/>It was a great satisfaction to Elinor that Mrs. Jennings, by being much
engaged in her (<font color='blue'><b>Jennings</b></font>) own room, could see little of what was passing. The tea
things were brought in, and already had Marianne been disappointed more
than once by a rap at a neighbouring door, when a loud one was suddenly
heard which could not be mistaken for one at any other house, Elinor
felt secure of its announcing Willoughby's approach, and Marianne,
starting up, moved towards the door. Every thing was silent; this
could not be borne many seconds; she (<font color='blue'><b>Marianne</b></font>) opened the door, advanced a few
steps towards the stairs, and after listening half a minute, returned
into the room in all the agitation which a conviction of having heard
him (<font color='blue'><b>Willoughby</b></font>) would naturally produce; in the ecstasy of her (<font color='blue'><b>Marianne</b></font>) feelings at that
instant she (<font color='blue'><b>Marianne</b></font>) could not help exclaiming, <div class="bookquote">``Oh, Elinor, it is Willoughby,
indeed it is!''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>and seemed almost ready to throw herself into his (<font color='blue'><b>Willoughby</b></font>) arms,
when Colonel Brandon appeared.

<p/>It was too great a shock to be borne with calmness, and she (<font color='blue'><b>Marianne</b></font>) immediately
left the room. Elinor was disappointed too; but at the same time her (<font color='blue'><b>Elinor</b></font>)
regard for Colonel Brandon ensured his (<font color='blue'><b>Brandon</b></font>) welcome with her (<font color='blue'><b>Elinor</b></font>); and she (<font color='blue'><b>Elinor</b></font>) felt
particularly hurt that a man so partial to her (<font color='blue'><b>Elinor</b></font>) sister should perceive
that she (<font color='blue'><b>Elinor</b></font>) experienced nothing but grief and disappointment in seeing
him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>). She (<font color='blue'><b>Elinor</b></font>) instantly saw that it was not unnoticed by him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>), that he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) even
observed Marianne as she (<font color='blue'><b>Marianne</b></font>) quitted the room, with such astonishment and
concern, as hardly left him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) the recollection of what civility demanded
towards herself.

<p/>Elinor answered in some distress that she (<font color='blue'><b>Elinor</b></font>) was, and then talked of
head-aches, low spirits, and over fatigues; and of every thing to which
she (<font color='blue'><b>Elinor</b></font>) could decently attribute her (<font color='blue'><b>Elinor</b></font>) sister's behaviour.

<p/>In this calm kind of way, with very little interest on either side,
they continued to talk, both of them out of spirits, and the thoughts
of both engaged elsewhere. Elinor wished very much to ask whether
Willoughby were then in town, but she (<font color='blue'><b>Elinor</b></font>) was afraid of giving him (<font color='blue'><b>Willoughby</b></font>) pain by
any enquiry after his (<font color='blue'><b>Willoughby</b></font>) rival; and at length, by way of saying something,
she (<font color='blue'><b>Elinor</b></font>) asked if he (<font color='blue'><b>Willoughby</b></font>) had been in London ever since she (<font color='blue'><b>Elinor</b></font>) had seen him (<font color='blue'><b>Willoughby</b></font>) last.
<div class="bookquote">``Yes,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Willoughby</b></font>) replied, with some embarrassment, <div class="bookquote">``almost ever since; I have
been once or twice at Delaford for a few days, but it has never been in
my power to return to Barton.''

 (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div><p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Willoughby</b></font>) replied with his (<font color='blue'><b>Willoughby</b></font>) accustomary mildness to all her (<font color='blue'><b>Elinor</b></font>) inquiries, but
without satisfying her (<font color='blue'><b>Elinor</b></font>) in any. Elinor now began to make the tea, and
Marianne was obliged to appear again.

<p/>After an hour or two spent in what her (<font color='blue'><b>Marianne</b></font>) mother called comfortable chat,
or in other words, in every variety of inquiry concerning all their
acquaintance on Mrs. Jennings's side, and in laughter without cause on
Mrs. Palmer's, it was proposed by the latter that they should all
accompany her (<font color='blue'><b>Palmer</b></font>) to some shops where she (<font color='blue'><b>Palmer</b></font>) had business that morning, to
which Mrs. Jennings and Elinor readily consented, as having likewise
some purchases to make themselves; and Marianne, though declining it at
first was induced to go likewise.

<p/>It was late in the morning before they returned home; and no sooner had
they entered the house than Marianne flew eagerly up stairs, and when
Elinor followed, she (<font color='blue'><b>Elinor</b></font>) found her (<font color='blue'><b>Elinor</b></font>) turning from the table with a sorrowful
countenance, which declared that no Willoughby had been there.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``How odd, indeed!''  (<font color='red'><b>Elinor/-- Elinor/ELINOR</b></font>)</div>repeated Elinor within herself, regarding her (<font color='blue'><b>Elinor</b></font>) sister
with uneasiness. <div class="bookquote">``If she (<font color='blue'><b>Elinor</b></font>) had not known him (<font color='blue'><b>Barton</b></font>) to be in town she (<font color='blue'><b>Elinor</b></font>) would not
have written to him (<font color='blue'><b>Barton</b></font>), as she (<font color='blue'><b>Elinor</b></font>) did; she (<font color='blue'><b>Elinor</b></font>) would have written to Combe Magna;
and if he (<font color='blue'><b>Magna</b></font>) is in town, how odd that he (<font color='blue'><b>Magna</b></font>) should neither come nor write!
Oh! my dear mother, you must be wrong in permitting an engagement
between a daughter so young, a man so little known, to be carried on in
so doubtful, so mysterious a manner! I long to inquire; and how will
MY interference be borne.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Mrs. Palmer</b></font>)</div><p/>Mrs. Palmer and two elderly ladies of Mrs. Jennings's intimate
acquaintance, whom she (<font color='blue'><b>Jennings</b></font>) had met and invited in the morning, dined with
them. The former left them soon after tea to fulfill her (<font color='blue'><b>Jennings</b></font>) evening
engagements; and Elinor was obliged to assist in making a whist table
for the others. Marianne was of no use on these occasions, as she (<font color='blue'><b>Marianne</b></font>)
would never learn the game; but though her (<font color='blue'><b>Marianne</b></font>) time was therefore at her (<font color='blue'><b>Marianne</b></font>)
own disposal, the evening was by no means more productive of pleasure
to her (<font color='blue'><b>Marianne</b></font>) than to Elinor, for it was spent in all the anxiety of
expectation and the pain of disappointment. She (<font color='blue'><b>Elinor</b></font>) sometimes endeavoured
for a few minutes to read; but the book was soon thrown aside, and she (<font color='blue'><b>Elinor</b></font>)
returned to the more interesting employment of walking backwards and
forwards across the room, pausing for a moment whenever she (<font color='blue'><b>Elinor</b></font>) came to the
window, in hopes of distinguishing the long-expected rap.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``At any rate,''  (<font color='red'><b>Elinor/-- Elinor/ELINOR</b></font>)</div>said Elinor, wishing to prevent Mrs. Jennings from
seeing her (<font color='blue'><b>Elinor</b></font>) sister's thoughts as clearly as she (<font color='blue'><b>Elinor</b></font>) did, <div class="bookquote">``I dare say we
shall have Sir John and Lady Middleton in town by the end of next week.''

 (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``And now,''  (<font color='red'><b>Elinor/-- Elinor/ELINOR</b></font>)</div>silently conjectured Elinor, <div class="bookquote">``she (<font color='blue'><b>Middleton</b></font>) will write to Combe by
this day's post.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Elinor/-- Elinor/ELINOR</b></font>)</div><p/>But if she (<font color='blue'><b>Elinor</b></font>) DID, the letter was written and sent away with a privacy
which eluded all her (<font color='blue'><b>Elinor</b></font>) watchfulness to ascertain the fact. Whatever the
truth of it might be, and far as Elinor was from feeling thorough
contentment about it, yet while she (<font color='blue'><b>Elinor</b></font>) saw Marianne in spirits, she (<font color='blue'><b>Elinor</b></font>) could
not be very uncomfortable herself. And Marianne was in spirits; happy
in the mildness of the weather, and still happier in her (<font color='blue'><b>Marianne</b></font>) expectation of
a frost.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Don't you find it colder than it was in the morning, Elinor? There
seems to me a very decided difference. I can hardly keep my hands warm
even in my muff. It was not so yesterday, I think. The clouds seem
parting too, the sun will be out in a moment, and we shall have a clear
afternoon.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Elinor/-- Elinor/ELINOR</b></font>)</div><p/>Elinor was alternately diverted and pained; but Marianne persevered,
and saw every night in the brightness of the fire, and every morning in
the appearance of the atmosphere, the certain symptoms of approaching
frost.

<p/>The Miss Dashwoods had no greater reason to be dissatisfied with Mrs.
Jennings's style of living, and set of acquaintance, than with her (<font color='blue'><b>Jennings</b></font>)
behaviour to themselves, which was invariably kind. Every thing in her (<font color='blue'><b>Jennings</b></font>)
household arrangements was conducted on the most liberal plan, and
excepting a few old city friends, whom, to Lady Middleton's regret, she (<font color='blue'><b>Middleton</b></font>)
had never dropped, she (<font color='blue'><b>Middleton</b></font>) visited no one to whom an introduction could at
all discompose the feelings of her (<font color='blue'><b>Middleton</b></font>) young companions. Pleased to find
herself more comfortably situated in that particular than she (<font color='blue'><b>Middleton</b></font>) had
expected, Elinor was very willing to compound for the want of much real
enjoyment from any of their evening parties, which, whether at home or
abroad, formed only for cards, could have little to amuse her (<font color='blue'><b>Elinor</b></font>).

<p/>Colonel Brandon, who had a general invitation to the house, was with
them almost every day; he (<font color='blue'><b>Brandon</b></font>) came to look at Marianne and talk to Elinor,
who often derived more satisfaction from conversing with him (<font color='blue'><b>Brandon</b></font>) than from
any other daily occurrence, but who saw at the same time with much
concern his (<font color='blue'><b>Brandon</b></font>) continued regard for her (<font color='blue'><b>Elinor</b></font>) sister. She (<font color='blue'><b>Elinor</b></font>) feared it was a
strengthening regard. It grieved her (<font color='blue'><b>Elinor</b></font>) to see the earnestness with which
he (<font color='blue'><b>Brandon</b></font>) often watched Marianne, and his (<font color='blue'><b>Brandon</b></font>) spirits were certainly worse than
when at Barton.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Good God!''  (<font color='red'><b>Marianne/Miss Marianne</b></font>)</div>cried Marianne, <div class="bookquote">``he (<font color='blue'><b>God</b></font>) has been here while we were out.''
 (<font color='red'><b>Marianne/Miss Marianne</b></font>)</div>Elinor, rejoiced to be assured of his (<font color='blue'><b>Barton</b></font>) being in London, now ventured to
say, <div class="bookquote">``Depend upon it, he (<font color='blue'><b>God</b></font>) will call again tomorrow.''  (<font color='red'><b>Elinor/-- Elinor/ELINOR</b></font>)</div>But Marianne
seemed hardly to hear her (<font color='blue'><b>Marianne</b></font>), and on Mrs. Jennings's entrance, escaped with
the precious card.

<p/>This event, while it raised the spirits of Elinor, restored to those of
her (<font color='blue'><b>Elinor</b></font>) sister all, and more than all, their former agitation. From this
moment her (<font color='blue'><b>Elinor</b></font>) mind was never quiet; the expectation of seeing him (<font color='blue'><b>Barton</b></font>) every
hour of the day, made her (<font color='blue'><b>Elinor</b></font>) unfit for any thing. She (<font color='blue'><b>Elinor</b></font>) insisted on being
left behind, the next morning, when the others went out.

<p/>Elinor's thoughts were full of what might be passing in Berkeley Street
during their absence; but a moment's glance at her (<font color='blue'><b>Elinor</b></font>) sister when they
returned was enough to inform her (<font color='blue'><b>Elinor</b></font>), that Willoughby had paid no second
visit there. A note was just then brought in, and laid on the table.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``You are expecting a letter, then?''  (<font color='red'><b>Elinor/-- Elinor/ELINOR</b></font>)</div>said Elinor, unable to be longer
silent.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Nay, Elinor, this reproach from YOU--you who have confidence in no
one!''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Me!''  (<font color='red'><b>Elinor/-- Elinor/ELINOR</b></font>)</div>returned Elinor in some confusion; <div class="bookquote">``indeed, Marianne, I have
nothing to tell.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Elinor/-- Elinor/ELINOR</b></font>)</div><p/>Elinor, distressed by this charge of reserve in herself, which she (<font color='blue'><b>Elinor</b></font>) was
not at liberty to do away, knew not how, under such circumstances, to
press for greater openness in Marianne.

<p/>Mrs. Jennings soon appeared, and the note being given her (<font color='blue'><b>Jennings</b></font>), she (<font color='blue'><b>Jennings</b></font>) read it
aloud. It was from Lady Middleton, announcing their arrival in Conduit
Street the night before, and requesting the company of her (<font color='blue'><b>Middleton</b></font>) mother and
cousins the following evening. Business on Sir John's part, and a
violent cold on her (<font color='blue'><b>John</b></font>) own, prevented their calling in Berkeley Street.
The invitation was accepted; but when the hour of appointment drew
near, necessary as it was in common civility to Mrs. Jennings, that
they should both attend her (<font color='blue'><b>Jennings</b></font>) on such a visit, Elinor had some difficulty
in persuading her (<font color='blue'><b>Elinor</b></font>) sister to go, for still she (<font color='blue'><b>Elinor</b></font>) had seen nothing of
Willoughby; and therefore was not more indisposed for amusement abroad,
than unwilling to run the risk of his (<font color='blue'><b>Willoughby</b></font>) calling again in her (<font color='blue'><b>Elinor</b></font>) absence.

<p/>Elinor found, when the evening was over, that disposition is not
materially altered by a change of abode, for although scarcely settled
in town, Sir John had contrived to collect around him (<font color='blue'><b>Willoughby</b></font>), nearly twenty
young people, and to amuse them with a ball. This was an affair,
however, of which Lady Middleton did not approve. In the country, an
unpremeditated dance was very allowable; but in London, where the
reputation of elegance was more important and less easily attained, it
was risking too much for the gratification of a few girls, to have it
known that Lady Middleton had given a small dance of eight or nine
couple, with two violins, and a mere side-board collation.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Did you?''  (<font color='red'><b>Elinor/-- Elinor/ELINOR</b></font>)</div>replied Elinor.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``So my daughter Middleton told me, for it seems Sir John met him (<font color='blue'><b>God</b></font>)
somewhere in the street this morning.''  (<font color='red'><b>Marianne/Miss Marianne</b></font>)</div>Marianne said no more, but
looked exceedingly hurt. Impatient in this situation to be doing
something that might lead to her (<font color='blue'><b>Marianne</b></font>) sister's relief, Elinor resolved to
write the next morning to her (<font color='blue'><b>Elinor</b></font>) mother, and hoped by awakening her (<font color='blue'><b>Elinor</b></font>) fears
for the health of Marianne, to procure those inquiries which had been
so long delayed; and she (<font color='blue'><b>Marianne</b></font>) was still more eagerly bent on this measure by
perceiving after breakfast on the morrow, that Marianne was again
writing to Willoughby, for she (<font color='blue'><b>Marianne</b></font>) could not suppose it to be to any other
person.

<p/>About the middle of the day, Mrs. Jennings went out by herself on
business, and Elinor began her (<font color='blue'><b>Elinor</b></font>) letter directly, while Marianne, too
restless for employment, too anxious for conversation, walked from one
window to the other, or sat down by the fire in melancholy meditation.
Elinor was very earnest in her (<font color='blue'><b>Elinor</b></font>) application to her (<font color='blue'><b>Elinor</b></font>) mother, relating all
that had passed, her (<font color='blue'><b>Elinor</b></font>) suspicions of Willoughby's inconstancy, urging her (<font color='blue'><b>Elinor</b></font>)
by every plea of duty and affection to demand from Marianne an account
of her (<font color='blue'><b>Marianne</b></font>) real situation with respect to him (<font color='blue'><b>Willoughby</b></font>).

<p/>Her (<font color='blue'><b>Marianne</b></font>) letter was scarcely finished, when a rap foretold a visitor, and
Colonel Brandon was announced. Marianne, who had seen him (<font color='blue'><b>Brandon</b></font>) from the
window, and who hated company of any kind, left the room before he (<font color='blue'><b>Brandon</b></font>)
entered it. He (<font color='blue'><b>Brandon</b></font>) looked more than usually grave, and though expressing
satisfaction at finding Miss Dashwood alone, as if he (<font color='blue'><b>Brandon</b></font>) had somewhat in
particular to tell her (<font color='blue'><b>Dashwood</b></font>), sat for some time without saying a word.
Elinor, persuaded that he (<font color='blue'><b>Brandon</b></font>) had some communication to make in which her (<font color='blue'><b>Elinor</b></font>)
sister was concerned, impatiently expected its opening. It was not the
first time of her (<font color='blue'><b>Elinor</b></font>) feeling the same kind of conviction; for, more than
once before, beginning with the observation of <div class="bookquote">``your sister looks
unwell to-day,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>or <div class="bookquote">``your sister seems out of spirits,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Brandon</b></font>) had appeared
on the point, either of disclosing, or of inquiring, something
particular about her (<font color='blue'><b>Elinor</b></font>). After a pause of several minutes, their silence
was broken, by his (<font color='blue'><b>Brandon</b></font>) asking her (<font color='blue'><b>Elinor</b></font>) in a voice of some agitation, when he (<font color='blue'><b>Brandon</b></font>) was
to congratulate her (<font color='blue'><b>Elinor</b></font>) on the acquisition of a brother? Elinor was not
prepared for such a question, and having no answer ready, was obliged
to adopt the simple and common expedient, of asking what he (<font color='blue'><b>Brandon</b></font>) meant? He (<font color='blue'><b>Brandon</b></font>)
tried to smile as he (<font color='blue'><b>Brandon</b></font>) replied, <div class="bookquote">``your sister's engagement to Mr.
Willoughby is very generally known.''

 (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``It cannot be generally known,''  (<font color='red'><b>Elinor/-- Elinor/ELINOR</b></font>)</div>returned Elinor, <div class="bookquote">``for her (<font color='blue'><b>sister</b></font>) own family do
not know it.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Elinor/-- Elinor/ELINOR</b></font>)</div><p/>These words, which conveyed to Elinor a direct avowal of his (<font color='blue'><b>Brandon</b></font>) love for
her (<font color='blue'><b>Elinor</b></font>) sister, affected her (<font color='blue'><b>Elinor</b></font>) very much. She (<font color='blue'><b>Elinor</b></font>) was not immediately able to
say anything, and even when her (<font color='blue'><b>Elinor</b></font>) spirits were recovered, she (<font color='blue'><b>Elinor</b></font>) debated for
a short time, on the answer it would be most proper to give. The real
state of things between Willoughby and her (<font color='blue'><b>Elinor</b></font>) sister was so little known
to herself, that in endeavouring to explain it, she (<font color='blue'><b>Elinor</b></font>) might be as liable
to say too much as too little. Yet as she (<font color='blue'><b>Elinor</b></font>) was convinced that
Marianne's affection for Willoughby, could leave no hope of Colonel
Brandon's success, whatever the event of that affection might be, and
at the same time wished to shield her (<font color='blue'><b>Elinor</b></font>) conduct from censure, she (<font color='blue'><b>Elinor</b></font>) thought
it most prudent and kind, after some consideration, to say more than
she (<font color='blue'><b>Elinor</b></font>) really knew or believed. She (<font color='blue'><b>Elinor</b></font>) acknowledged, therefore, that though
she (<font color='blue'><b>Elinor</b></font>) had never been informed by themselves of the terms on which they
stood with each other, of their mutual affection she (<font color='blue'><b>Elinor</b></font>) had no doubt, and
of their correspondence she (<font color='blue'><b>Elinor</b></font>) was not astonished to hear.

<p/>Elinor derived no comfortable feelings from this conversation, to
lessen the uneasiness of her (<font color='blue'><b>Elinor</b></font>) mind on other points; she (<font color='blue'><b>Elinor</b></font>) was left, on the
contrary, with a melancholy impression of Colonel Brandon's
unhappiness, and was prevented even from wishing it removed, by her (<font color='blue'><b>Elinor</b></font>)
anxiety for the very event that must confirm it.

<p/>Nothing occurred during the next three or four days, to make Elinor
regret what she (<font color='blue'><b>Elinor</b></font>) had done, in applying to her (<font color='blue'><b>Elinor</b></font>) mother; for Willoughby
neither came nor wrote. They were engaged about the end of that time
to attend Lady Middleton to a party, from which Mrs. Jennings was kept
away by the indisposition of her (<font color='blue'><b>Jennings</b></font>) youngest daughter; and for this party,
Marianne, wholly dispirited, careless of her (<font color='blue'><b>Marianne</b></font>) appearance, and seeming
equally indifferent whether she (<font color='blue'><b>Marianne</b></font>) went or staid, prepared, without one
look of hope or one expression of pleasure. She (<font color='blue'><b>Marianne</b></font>) sat by the
drawing-room fire after tea, till the moment of Lady Middleton's
arrival, without once stirring from her (<font color='blue'><b>Middleton</b></font>) seat, or altering her (<font color='blue'><b>Middleton</b></font>) attitude,
lost in her (<font color='blue'><b>Middleton</b></font>) own thoughts, and insensible of her (<font color='blue'><b>Middleton</b></font>) sister's presence; and
when at last they were told that Lady Middleton waited for them at the
door, she (<font color='blue'><b>Middleton</b></font>) started as if she (<font color='blue'><b>Middleton</b></font>) had forgotten that any one was expected.

<p/>They arrived in due time at the place of destination, and as soon as
the string of carriages before them would allow, alighted, ascended the
stairs, heard their names announced from one landing-place to another
in an audible voice, and entered a room splendidly lit up, quite full
of company, and insufferably hot. When they had paid their tribute of
politeness by curtsying to the lady of the house, they were permitted
to mingle in the crowd, and take their share of the heat and
inconvenience, to which their arrival must necessarily add. After some
time spent in saying little or doing less, Lady Middleton sat down to
Cassino, and as Marianne was not in spirits for moving about, she (<font color='blue'><b>Marianne</b></font>) and
Elinor luckily succeeding to chairs, placed themselves at no great
distance from the table.

<p/>They had not remained in this manner long, before Elinor perceived
Willoughby, standing within a few yards of them, in earnest
conversation with a very fashionable looking young woman. She (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) soon
caught his (<font color='blue'><b>Willoughby</b></font>) eye, and he (<font color='blue'><b>Willoughby</b></font>) immediately bowed, but without attempting to
speak to her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>), or to approach Marianne, though he (<font color='blue'><b>Willoughby</b></font>) could not but see her (<font color='blue'><b>Marianne</b></font>);
and then continued his (<font color='blue'><b>Willoughby</b></font>) discourse with the same lady. Elinor turned
involuntarily to Marianne, to see whether it could be unobserved by
her (<font color='blue'><b>Elinor</b></font>). At that moment she (<font color='blue'><b>Elinor</b></font>) first perceived him (<font color='blue'><b>Willoughby</b></font>), and her (<font color='blue'><b>Elinor</b></font>) whole countenance
glowing with sudden delight, she (<font color='blue'><b>Elinor</b></font>) would have moved towards him (<font color='blue'><b>Willoughby</b></font>)
instantly, had not her (<font color='blue'><b>Elinor</b></font>) sister caught hold of her (<font color='blue'><b>Elinor</b></font>).

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Pray, pray be composed,''  (<font color='red'><b>Elinor/-- Elinor/ELINOR</b></font>)</div>cried Elinor, <div class="bookquote">``and do not betray what you
feel to every body present. Perhaps he (<font color='blue'><b>Willoughby</b></font>) has not observed you yet.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Elinor/-- Elinor/ELINOR</b></font>)</div><p/>At last he (<font color='blue'><b>Willoughby</b></font>) turned round again, and regarded them both; she (<font color='blue'><b>Elinor</b></font>) started up,
and pronouncing his (<font color='blue'><b>Willoughby</b></font>) name in a tone of affection, held out her (<font color='blue'><b>Elinor</b></font>) hand to
him (<font color='blue'><b>Willoughby</b></font>). He (<font color='blue'><b>Willoughby</b></font>) approached, and addressing himself rather to Elinor than
Marianne, as if wishing to avoid her (<font color='blue'><b>Marianne</b></font>) eye, and determined not to observe
her (<font color='blue'><b>Marianne</b></font>) attitude, inquired in a hurried manner after Mrs. Dashwood, and
asked how long they had been in town. Elinor was robbed of all
presence of mind by such an address, and was unable to say a word. But
the feelings of her (<font color='blue'><b>Elinor</b></font>) sister were instantly expressed. Her (<font color='blue'><b>Elinor</b></font>) face was
crimsoned over, and she (<font color='blue'><b>Elinor</b></font>) exclaimed, in a voice of the greatest emotion,
<div class="bookquote">``Good God! Willoughby, what is the meaning of this? Have you not
received my letters? Will you not shake hands with me?''

 (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div><p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Willoughby</b></font>) could not then avoid it, but her (<font color='blue'><b>Elinor</b></font>) touch seemed painful to him (<font color='blue'><b>Willoughby</b></font>), and he (<font color='blue'><b>Willoughby</b></font>)
held her (<font color='blue'><b>Elinor</b></font>) hand only for a moment. During all this time he (<font color='blue'><b>Willoughby</b></font>) was evidently
struggling for composure. Elinor watched his (<font color='blue'><b>Willoughby</b></font>) countenance and saw its
expression becoming more tranquil. After a moment's pause, he (<font color='blue'><b>Willoughby</b></font>) spoke
with calmness.

<p/>Marianne, now looking dreadfully white, and unable to stand, sunk into
her (<font color='blue'><b>Marianne</b></font>) chair, and Elinor, expecting every moment to see her (<font color='blue'><b>Elinor</b></font>) faint, tried
to screen her (<font color='blue'><b>Elinor</b></font>) from the observation of others, while reviving her (<font color='blue'><b>Elinor</b></font>) with
lavender water.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Go to him (<font color='blue'><b>Willoughby</b></font>), Elinor,''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Elinor</b></font>) cried, as soon as she (<font color='blue'><b>Elinor</b></font>) could speak, <div class="bookquote">``and force
him (<font color='blue'><b>Willoughby</b></font>) to come to me. Tell him (<font color='blue'><b>Willoughby</b></font>) I must see him (<font color='blue'><b>Willoughby</b></font>) again--must speak to him (<font color='blue'><b>Willoughby</b></font>)
instantly.-- I cannot rest--I shall not have a moment's peace till this
is explained--some dreadful misapprehension or other.-- Oh go to him (<font color='blue'><b>Willoughby</b></font>)
this moment.''

 (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div><p/>With difficulty however could she (<font color='blue'><b>Elinor</b></font>) prevent her (<font color='blue'><b>Elinor</b></font>) from following him (<font color='blue'><b>Willoughby</b></font>)
herself; and to persuade her (<font color='blue'><b>Elinor</b></font>) to check her (<font color='blue'><b>Elinor</b></font>) agitation, to wait, at least,
with the appearance of composure, till she (<font color='blue'><b>Elinor</b></font>) might speak to him (<font color='blue'><b>Willoughby</b></font>) with more
privacy and more effect, was impossible; for Marianne continued
incessantly to give way in a low voice to the misery of her (<font color='blue'><b>Marianne</b></font>) feelings,
by exclamations of wretchedness. In a short time Elinor saw Willoughby
quit the room by the door towards the staircase, and telling Marianne
that he (<font color='blue'><b>Willoughby</b></font>) was gone, urged the impossibility of speaking to him (<font color='blue'><b>Willoughby</b></font>) again that
evening, as a fresh argument for her (<font color='blue'><b>Marianne</b></font>) to be calm. She (<font color='blue'><b>Marianne</b></font>) instantly begged
her (<font color='blue'><b>Marianne</b></font>) sister would entreat Lady Middleton to take them home, as she (<font color='blue'><b>Marianne</b></font>) was
too miserable to stay a minute longer.

<p/>Before the house-maid had lit their fire the next day, or the sun
gained any power over a cold, gloomy morning in January, Marianne, only
half dressed, was kneeling against one of the window-seats for the sake
of all the little light she (<font color='blue'><b>Marianne</b></font>) could command from it, and writing as fast
as a continual flow of tears would permit her (<font color='blue'><b>Marianne</b></font>). In this situation,
Elinor, roused from sleep by her (<font color='blue'><b>Elinor</b></font>) agitation and sobs, first perceived
her (<font color='blue'><b>Elinor</b></font>); and after observing her (<font color='blue'><b>Elinor</b></font>) for a few moments with silent anxiety,
said, in a tone of the most considerate gentleness,

<p/><div class="bookquote">``No, Elinor,''  (<font color='red'><b>Elinor/-- Elinor/ELINOR</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Elinor</b></font>) replied, <div class="bookquote">``ask nothing; you will soon know all.''

 (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div><p/>Elinor paid her (<font color='blue'><b>Elinor</b></font>) every quiet and unobtrusive attention in her (<font color='blue'><b>Elinor</b></font>) power; and
she (<font color='blue'><b>Elinor</b></font>) would have tried to sooth and tranquilize her (<font color='blue'><b>Elinor</b></font>) still more, had not
Marianne entreated her (<font color='blue'><b>Marianne</b></font>), with all the eagerness of the most nervous
irritability, not to speak to her (<font color='blue'><b>Marianne</b></font>) for the world. In such
circumstances, it was better for both that they should not be long
together; and the restless state of Marianne's mind not only prevented
her (<font color='blue'><b>Marianne</b></font>) from remaining in the room a moment after she (<font color='blue'><b>Marianne</b></font>) was dressed, but
requiring at once solitude and continual change of place, made her (<font color='blue'><b>Marianne</b></font>)
wander about the house till breakfast time, avoiding the sight of every
body.

<p/>At breakfast she (<font color='blue'><b>Marianne</b></font>) neither ate, nor attempted to eat any thing; and
Elinor's attention was then all employed, not in urging her (<font color='blue'><b>Elinor</b></font>), not in
pitying her (<font color='blue'><b>Elinor</b></font>), nor in appearing to regard her (<font color='blue'><b>Elinor</b></font>), but in endeavouring to
engage Mrs. Jennings's notice entirely to herself.

<p/>As this was a favourite meal with Mrs. Jennings, it lasted a
considerable time, and they were just setting themselves, after it,
round the common working table, when a letter was delivered to
Marianne, which she (<font color='blue'><b>Marianne</b></font>) eagerly caught from the servant, and, turning of a
death-like paleness, instantly ran out of the room. Elinor, who saw as
plainly by this, as if she (<font color='blue'><b>Elinor</b></font>) had seen the direction, that it must come
from Willoughby, felt immediately such a sickness at heart as made her (<font color='blue'><b>Elinor</b></font>)
hardly able to hold up her (<font color='blue'><b>Elinor</b></font>) head, and sat in such a general tremour as
made her (<font color='blue'><b>Elinor</b></font>) fear it impossible to escape Mrs. Jennings's notice. That good
lady, however, saw only that Marianne had received a letter from
Willoughby, which appeared to her (<font color='blue'><b>Marianne</b></font>) a very good joke, and which she (<font color='blue'><b>Marianne</b></font>)
treated accordingly, by hoping, with a laugh, that she (<font color='blue'><b>Marianne</b></font>) would find it to
her (<font color='blue'><b>Marianne</b></font>) liking. Of Elinor's distress, she (<font color='blue'><b>Elinor</b></font>) was too busily employed in
measuring lengths of worsted for her (<font color='blue'><b>Elinor</b></font>) rug, to see any thing at all; and
calmly continuing her (<font color='blue'><b>Elinor</b></font>) talk, as soon as Marianne disappeared, she (<font color='blue'><b>Marianne</b></font>) said,

<p/>Elinor, though never less disposed to speak than at that moment,
obliged herself to answer such an attack as this, and, therefore,
trying to smile, replied, <div class="bookquote">``And have you really, Ma'am, talked yourself
into a persuasion of my sister's being engaged to Mr. Willoughby? I
thought it had been only a joke, but so serious a question seems to
imply more; and I must beg, therefore, that you will not deceive
yourself any longer. I do assure you that nothing would surprise me
more than to hear of their being going to be married.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Elinor/-- Elinor/ELINOR</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Indeed, Ma'am,''  (<font color='red'><b>Elinor/-- Elinor/ELINOR</b></font>)</div>said Elinor, very seriously, <div class="bookquote">``you are mistaken.
Indeed, you are doing a very unkind thing in spreading the report, and
you will find that you have though you will not believe me now.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Elinor/-- Elinor/ELINOR</b></font>)</div><p/>Mrs. Jennings laughed again, but Elinor had not spirits to say more,
and eager at all events to know what Willoughby had written, hurried
away to their room, where, on opening the door, she (<font color='blue'><b>Elinor</b></font>) saw Marianne
stretched on the bed, almost choked by grief, one letter in her (<font color='blue'><b>Marianne</b></font>) hand,
and two or three others laying by her (<font color='blue'><b>Marianne</b></font>). Elinor drew near, but without
saying a word; and seating herself on the bed, took her (<font color='blue'><b>Elinor</b></font>) hand, kissed
her (<font color='blue'><b>Elinor</b></font>) affectionately several times, and then gave way to a burst of
tears, which at first was scarcely less violent than Marianne's. The
latter, though unable to speak, seemed to feel all the tenderness of
this behaviour, and after some time thus spent in joint affliction, she (<font color='blue'><b>Marianne</b></font>)
put all the letters into Elinor's hands; and then covering her (<font color='blue'><b>Elinor</b></font>) face
with her (<font color='blue'><b>Elinor</b></font>) handkerchief, almost screamed with agony. Elinor, who knew
that such grief, shocking as it was to witness it, must have its
course, watched by her (<font color='blue'><b>Elinor</b></font>) till this excess of suffering had somewhat spent
itself, and then turning eagerly to Willoughby's letter, read as
follows:

<p/>In her (<font color='blue'><b>Elinor</b></font>) earnest meditations on the contents of the letter, on the
depravity of that mind which could dictate it, and probably, on the
very different mind of a very different person, who had no other
connection whatever with the affair than what her (<font color='blue'><b>Elinor</b></font>) heart gave him (<font color='blue'><b>Willoughby</b></font>) with
every thing that passed, Elinor forgot the immediate distress of her (<font color='blue'><b>Elinor</b></font>)
sister, forgot that she (<font color='blue'><b>Elinor</b></font>) had three letters on her (<font color='blue'><b>Elinor</b></font>) lap yet unread, and so
entirely forgot how long she (<font color='blue'><b>Elinor</b></font>) had been in the room, that when on hearing
a carriage drive up to the door, she (<font color='blue'><b>Elinor</b></font>) went to the window to see who
could be coming so unreasonably early, she (<font color='blue'><b>Elinor</b></font>) was all astonishment to
perceive Mrs. Jennings's chariot, which she (<font color='blue'><b>Jennings</b></font>) knew had not been ordered
till one. Determined not to quit Marianne, though hopeless of
contributing, at present, to her (<font color='blue'><b>Marianne</b></font>) ease, she (<font color='blue'><b>Marianne</b></font>) hurried away to excuse
herself from attending Mrs. Jennings, on account of her (<font color='blue'><b>Jennings</b></font>) sister being
indisposed. Mrs. Jennings, with a thoroughly good-humoured concern for
its cause, admitted the excuse most readily, and Elinor, after seeing
her (<font color='blue'><b>Elinor</b></font>) safe off, returned to Marianne, whom she (<font color='blue'><b>Marianne</b></font>) found attempting to rise
from the bed, and whom she (<font color='blue'><b>Marianne</b></font>) reached just in time to prevent her (<font color='blue'><b>Marianne</b></font>) from
falling on the floor, faint and giddy from a long want of proper rest
and food; for it was many days since she (<font color='blue'><b>Marianne</b></font>) had any appetite, and many
nights since she (<font color='blue'><b>Marianne</b></font>) had really slept; and now, when her (<font color='blue'><b>Marianne</b></font>) mind was no longer
supported by the fever of suspense, the consequence of all this was
felt in an aching head, a weakened stomach, and a general nervous
faintness. A glass of wine, which Elinor procured for her (<font color='blue'><b>Elinor</b></font>) directly,
made her (<font color='blue'><b>Elinor</b></font>) more comfortable, and she (<font color='blue'><b>Elinor</b></font>) was at last able to express some
sense of her (<font color='blue'><b>Elinor</b></font>) kindness, by saying,

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Poor Elinor! how unhappy I make you!''

 (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div><p/>This, as every thing else would have been, was too much for Marianne,
who could only exclaim, in the anguish of her (<font color='blue'><b>Marianne</b></font>) heart, <div class="bookquote">``Oh! Elinor, I am
miserable, indeed,''  (<font color='red'><b>Marianne/Miss Marianne</b></font>)</div>before her (<font color='blue'><b>Marianne</b></font>) voice was entirely lost in sobs.

<p/>Elinor could no longer witness this torrent of unresisted grief in
silence.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``I cannot, I cannot,''  (<font color='red'><b>Marianne/Miss Marianne</b></font>)</div>cried Marianne; <div class="bookquote">``leave me, leave me, if I
distress you; leave me, hate me, forget me! but do not torture me so.
Oh! how easy for those, who have no sorrow of their own to talk of
exertion! Happy, happy Elinor, YOU cannot have an idea of what I
suffer.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Marianne/Miss Marianne</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Many, many circumstances,''  (<font color='red'><b>Elinor/-- Elinor/ELINOR</b></font>)</div>said Elinor, solemnly.

<p/>Elinor said no more, and turning again to the three letters which now
raised a much stronger curiosity than before, directly ran over the
contents of all. The first, which was what her (<font color='blue'><b>Elinor</b></font>) sister had sent him (<font color='blue'><b>witness</b></font>) on
their arrival in town, was to this effect.

<p/>That such letters, so full of affection and confidence, could have been
so answered, Elinor, for Willoughby's sake, would have been unwilling
to believe. But her (<font color='blue'><b>Elinor</b></font>) condemnation of him (<font color='blue'><b>Willoughby</b></font>) did not blind her (<font color='blue'><b>Elinor</b></font>) to the
impropriety of their having been written at all; and she (<font color='blue'><b>Elinor</b></font>) was silently
grieving over the imprudence which had hazarded such unsolicited proofs
of tenderness, not warranted by anything preceding, and most severely
condemned by the event, when Marianne, perceiving that she (<font color='blue'><b>Marianne</b></font>) had finished
the letters, observed to her (<font color='blue'><b>Marianne</b></font>) that they contained nothing but what any
one would have written in the same situation.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``I can believe it,''  (<font color='red'><b>Elinor/-- Elinor/ELINOR</b></font>)</div>said Elinor; <div class="bookquote">``but unfortunately he (<font color='blue'><b>YOU</b></font>) did not feel the
same.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Elinor/-- Elinor/ELINOR</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``He (<font color='blue'><b>YOU</b></font>) DID feel the same, Elinor--for weeks and weeks he (<font color='blue'><b>YOU</b></font>) felt it. I know
he (<font color='blue'><b>YOU</b></font>) did. Whatever may have changed him (<font color='blue'><b>YOU</b></font>) now, -LRB-and nothing but the
blackest art employed against me can have done it-RRB-, I was once as dear
to him (<font color='blue'><b>YOU</b></font>) as my own soul could wish. This lock of hair, which now he (<font color='blue'><b>YOU</b></font>) can
so readily give up, was begged of me with the most earnest
supplication. Had you seen his (<font color='blue'><b>YOU</b></font>) look, his (<font color='blue'><b>YOU</b></font>) manner, had you heard his (<font color='blue'><b>YOU</b></font>)
voice at that moment! Have you forgot the last evening of our being
together at Barton? The morning that we parted too! When he (<font color='blue'><b>Barton</b></font>) told me
that it might be many weeks before we met again--his (<font color='blue'><b>Barton</b></font>) distress--can I
ever forget his (<font color='blue'><b>Barton</b></font>) distress?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Elinor, I have been cruelly used; but not by Willoughby.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Elinor/-- Elinor/ELINOR</b></font>)</div><p/>Elinor would not contend, and only replied, <div class="bookquote">``Whoever may have been so
detestably your enemy, let them be cheated of their malignant triumph,
my dear sister, by seeing how nobly the consciousness of your own
innocence and good intentions supports your spirits. It is a
reasonable and laudable pride which resists such malevolence.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Elinor/-- Elinor/ELINOR</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``No, no,''  (<font color='red'><b>Marianne/Miss Marianne</b></font>)</div>cried Marianne, <div class="bookquote">``misery such as mine has no pride. I care
not who knows that I am wretched. The triumph of seeing me so may be
open to all the world. Elinor, Elinor, they who suffer little may be
proud and independent as they like--may resist insult, or return
mortification--but I cannot. I must feel--I must be wretched--and they
are welcome to enjoy the consciousness of it that can.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Marianne/Miss Marianne</b></font>)</div><p/>Again they were both silent. Elinor was employed in walking
thoughtfully from the fire to the window, from the window to the fire,
without knowing that she (<font color='blue'><b>Elinor</b></font>) received warmth from one, or discerning
objects through the other; and Marianne, seated at the foot of the bed,
with her (<font color='blue'><b>Marianne</b></font>) head leaning against one of its posts, again took up
Willoughby's letter, and, after shuddering over every sentence,
exclaimed--

<p/>``It is too much! Oh, Willoughby, Willoughby, could this be yours!
Cruel, cruel--nothing can acquit you. Elinor, nothing can. Whatever
he (<font color='blue'><b>Willoughby</b></font>) might have heard against me--ought he (<font color='blue'><b>Willoughby</b></font>) not to have suspended his (<font color='blue'><b>Willoughby</b></font>)
belief? ought he (<font color='blue'><b>Willoughby</b></font>) not to have told me of it, to have given me the power
of clearing myself? <div class="bookquote">``The lock of hair, -LRB-repeating it from the letter,-RRB-
which you so obligingly bestowed on me'--That is unpardonable.
Willoughby, where was your heart when you wrote those words? Oh,
barbarously insolent!--Elinor, can he (<font color='blue'><b>Willoughby</b></font>) be justified?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Elinor, I must go home. I must go and comfort mama. Can not we be
gone to-morrow?''

 (<font color='red'><b>Elinor/-- Elinor/ELINOR</b></font>)</div><p/>Elinor advised her (<font color='blue'><b>Elinor</b></font>) to lie down again, and for a moment she (<font color='blue'><b>Elinor</b></font>) did so; but
no attitude could give her (<font color='blue'><b>Elinor</b></font>) ease; and in restless pain of mind and body
she (<font color='blue'><b>Elinor</b></font>) moved from one posture to another, till growing more and more
hysterical, her (<font color='blue'><b>Elinor</b></font>) sister could with difficulty keep her (<font color='blue'><b>Elinor</b></font>) on the bed at
all, and for some time was fearful of being constrained to call for
assistance. Some lavender drops, however, which she (<font color='blue'><b>Elinor</b></font>) was at length
persuaded to take, were of use; and from that time till Mrs. Jennings
returned, she (<font color='blue'><b>Jennings</b></font>) continued on the bed quiet and motionless.

<p/>Marianne, to the surprise of her (<font color='blue'><b>Marianne</b></font>) sister, determined on dining with
them. Elinor even advised her (<font color='blue'><b>Elinor</b></font>) against it. But <div class="bookquote">``no, she (<font color='blue'><b>Elinor</b></font>) would go down;
she (<font color='blue'><b>Elinor</b></font>) could bear it very well, and the bustle about her (<font color='blue'><b>Elinor</b></font>) would be less.''
 (<font color='red'><b>Elinor/-- Elinor/ELINOR</b></font>)</div>Elinor, pleased to have her (<font color='blue'><b>Elinor</b></font>) governed for a moment by such a motive,
though believing it hardly possible that she (<font color='blue'><b>Elinor</b></font>) could sit out the dinner,
said no more; and adjusting her (<font color='blue'><b>Elinor</b></font>) dress for her (<font color='blue'><b>Elinor</b></font>) as well as she (<font color='blue'><b>Elinor</b></font>) could,
while Marianne still remained on the bed, was ready to assist her (<font color='blue'><b>Marianne</b></font>) into
the dining room as soon as they were summoned to it.

<p/>Elinor, who did justice to Mrs. Jennings's kindness, though its
effusions were often distressing, and sometimes almost ridiculous, made
her (<font color='blue'><b>Elinor</b></font>) those acknowledgments, and returned her (<font color='blue'><b>Elinor</b></font>) those civilities, which her (<font color='blue'><b>Elinor</b></font>)
sister could not make or return for herself. Their good friend saw
that Marianne was unhappy, and felt that every thing was due to her (<font color='blue'><b>Marianne</b></font>)
which might make her (<font color='blue'><b>Marianne</b></font>) at all less so. She (<font color='blue'><b>Marianne</b></font>) treated her (<font color='blue'><b>Marianne</b></font>) therefore, with
all the indulgent fondness of a parent towards a favourite child on the
last day of its holidays. Marianne was to have the best place by the
fire, was to be tempted to eat by every delicacy in the house, and to
be amused by the relation of all the news of the day. Had not Elinor,
in the sad countenance of her (<font color='blue'><b>Elinor</b></font>) sister, seen a check to all mirth, she (<font color='blue'><b>Elinor</b></font>)
could have been entertained by Mrs. Jennings's endeavours to cure a
disappointment in love, by a variety of sweetmeats and olives, and a
good fire. As soon, however, as the consciousness of all this was
forced by continual repetition on Marianne, she (<font color='blue'><b>Marianne</b></font>) could stay no longer.
With a hasty exclamation of Misery, and a sign to her (<font color='blue'><b>Marianne</b></font>) sister not to
follow her (<font color='blue'><b>Marianne</b></font>), she (<font color='blue'><b>Marianne</b></font>) directly got up and hurried out of the room.

<p/>Elinor, for her (<font color='blue'><b>Elinor</b></font>) sister's sake, could not press the subject farther, and
she (<font color='blue'><b>Elinor</b></font>) hoped it was not required of her (<font color='blue'><b>Elinor</b></font>) for Willoughby's; since, though
Marianne might lose much, he (<font color='blue'><b>Willoughby</b></font>) could gain very little by the enforcement
of the real truth. After a short silence on both sides, Mrs. Jennings,
with all her (<font color='blue'><b>Jennings</b></font>) natural hilarity, burst forth again.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Ay, if we can do THAT, Ma'am,''  (<font color='red'><b>Elinor/-- Elinor/ELINOR</b></font>)</div>said Elinor, <div class="bookquote">``we shall do very well
with or without Colonel Brandon.''  (<font color='red'><b>Elinor/-- Elinor/ELINOR</b></font>)</div>And then rising, she (<font color='blue'><b>Elinor</b></font>) went away to
join Marianne, whom she (<font color='blue'><b>Marianne</b></font>) found, as she (<font color='blue'><b>Marianne</b></font>) expected, in her (<font color='blue'><b>Marianne</b></font>) own room,
leaning, in silent misery, over the small remains of a fire, which,
till Elinor's entrance, had been her (<font color='blue'><b>Elinor</b></font>) only light.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``I will leave you,''  (<font color='red'><b>Elinor/-- Elinor/ELINOR</b></font>)</div>said Elinor, <div class="bookquote">``if you will go to bed.''  (<font color='red'><b>Elinor/-- Elinor/ELINOR</b></font>)</div>But this,
from the momentary perverseness of impatient suffering, she (<font color='blue'><b>Elinor</b></font>) at first
refused to do. Her (<font color='blue'><b>Elinor</b></font>) sister's earnest, though gentle persuasion,
however, soon softened her (<font color='blue'><b>Elinor</b></font>) to compliance, and Elinor saw her (<font color='blue'><b>Elinor</b></font>) lay her (<font color='blue'><b>Elinor</b></font>)
aching head on the pillow, and as she (<font color='blue'><b>Elinor</b></font>) hoped, in a way to get some quiet
rest before she (<font color='blue'><b>Elinor</b></font>) left her (<font color='blue'><b>Elinor</b></font>).

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Dear Ma'am,''  (<font color='red'><b>Elinor/-- Elinor/ELINOR</b></font>)</div>replied Elinor, smiling at the difference of the
complaints for which it was recommended, <div class="bookquote">``how good you are! But I have
just left Marianne in bed, and, I hope, almost asleep; and as I think
nothing will be of so much service to her (<font color='blue'><b>Marianne</b></font>) as rest, if you will give me
leave, I will drink the wine myself.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Elinor/-- Elinor/ELINOR</b></font>)</div><p/>Mrs. Jennings, though regretting that she (<font color='blue'><b>Jennings</b></font>) had not been five minutes
earlier, was satisfied with the compromise; and Elinor, as she (<font color='blue'><b>Elinor</b></font>)
swallowed the chief of it, reflected, that though its effects on a
colicky gout were, at present, of little importance to her (<font color='blue'><b>Elinor</b></font>), its healing
powers, on a disappointed heart might be as reasonably tried on herself
as on her (<font color='blue'><b>Elinor</b></font>) sister.

<p/>Colonel Brandon came in while the party were at tea, and by his (<font color='blue'><b>Brandon</b></font>) manner
of looking round the room for Marianne, Elinor immediately fancied that
he (<font color='blue'><b>Brandon</b></font>) neither expected nor wished to see her (<font color='blue'><b>Elinor</b></font>) there, and, in short, that he (<font color='blue'><b>Brandon</b></font>)
was already aware of what occasioned her (<font color='blue'><b>Elinor</b></font>) absence. Mrs. Jennings was
not struck by the same thought; for soon after his (<font color='blue'><b>Brandon</b></font>) entrance, she (<font color='blue'><b>Jennings</b></font>) walked
across the room to the tea-table where Elinor presided, and whispered--
<div class="bookquote">``The Colonel looks as grave as ever you see. He (<font color='blue'><b>Colonel</b></font>) knows nothing of it;
do tell him (<font color='blue'><b>Colonel</b></font>), my dear.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Elinor/-- Elinor/ELINOR</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``You mean,''  (<font color='red'><b>Elinor/-- Elinor/ELINOR</b></font>)</div>answered Elinor, with forced calmness, <div class="bookquote">``Mr. Willoughby's
marriage with Miss Grey. Yes, we DO know it all. This seems to have
been a day of general elucidation, for this very morning first unfolded
it to us. Mr. Willoughby is unfathomable! Where did you hear it?''

 (<font color='red'><b>Elinor/-- Elinor/ELINOR</b></font>)</div><p/>Elinor encouraged her (<font color='blue'><b>Elinor</b></font>) as much as possible to talk of what she (<font color='blue'><b>Elinor</b></font>) felt; and
before breakfast was ready, they had gone through the subject again and
again; and with the same steady conviction and affectionate counsel on
Elinor's side, the same impetuous feelings and varying opinions on
Marianne's, as before. Sometimes she (<font color='blue'><b>Marianne</b></font>) could believe Willoughby to be as
unfortunate and as innocent as herself, and at others, lost every
consolation in the impossibility of acquitting him (<font color='blue'><b>Willoughby</b></font>). At one moment she (<font color='blue'><b>Marianne</b></font>)
was absolutely indifferent to the observation of all the world, at
another she (<font color='blue'><b>Marianne</b></font>) would seclude herself from it for ever, and at a third
could resist it with energy. In one thing, however, she (<font color='blue'><b>Marianne</b></font>) was uniform,
when it came to the point, in avoiding, where it was possible, the
presence of Mrs. Jennings, and in a determined silence when obliged to
endure it. Her (<font color='blue'><b>Jennings</b></font>) heart was hardened against the belief of Mrs.
Jennings's entering into her (<font color='blue'><b>Jennings</b></font>) sorrows with any compassion.

<p/>Elinor had not needed this to be assured of the injustice to which her (<font color='blue'><b>Elinor</b></font>)
sister was often led in her (<font color='blue'><b>Elinor</b></font>) opinion of others, by the irritable
refinement of her (<font color='blue'><b>Elinor</b></font>) own mind, and the too great importance placed by her (<font color='blue'><b>Elinor</b></font>)
on the delicacies of a strong sensibility, and the graces of a polished
manner. Like half the rest of the world, if more than half there be
that are clever and good, Marianne, with excellent abilities and an
excellent disposition, was neither reasonable nor candid. She (<font color='blue'><b>Marianne</b></font>) expected
from other people the same opinions and feelings as her (<font color='blue'><b>Marianne</b></font>) own, and she (<font color='blue'><b>Marianne</b></font>)
judged of their motives by the immediate effect of their actions on
herself. Thus a circumstance occurred, while the sisters were together
in their own room after breakfast, which sunk the heart of Mrs.
Jennings still lower in her (<font color='blue'><b>Jennings</b></font>) estimation; because, through her (<font color='blue'><b>Jennings</b></font>) own
weakness, it chanced to prove a source of fresh pain to herself, though
Mrs. Jennings was governed in it by an impulse of the utmost goodwill.

<p/>The cruelty of Mrs. Jennings no language, within her (<font color='blue'><b>Jennings</b></font>) reach in her (<font color='blue'><b>Jennings</b></font>)
moments of happiest eloquence, could have expressed; and now she (<font color='blue'><b>Jennings</b></font>) could
reproach her (<font color='blue'><b>Jennings</b></font>) only by the tears which streamed from her (<font color='blue'><b>Jennings</b></font>) eyes with
passionate violence--a reproach, however, so entirely lost on its
object, that after many expressions of pity, she (<font color='blue'><b>Jennings</b></font>) withdrew, still
referring her (<font color='blue'><b>Jennings</b></font>) to the letter of comfort. But the letter, when she (<font color='blue'><b>Jennings</b></font>) was
calm enough to read it, brought little comfort. Willoughby filled
every page. Her (<font color='blue'><b>Jennings</b></font>) mother, still confident of their engagement, and
relying as warmly as ever on his (<font color='blue'><b>Willoughby</b></font>) constancy, had only been roused by
Elinor's application, to intreat from Marianne greater openness towards
them both; and this, with such tenderness towards her (<font color='blue'><b>Marianne</b></font>), such affection
for Willoughby, and such a conviction of their future happiness in each
other, that she (<font color='blue'><b>Marianne</b></font>) wept with agony through the whole of it.

<p/>All her (<font color='blue'><b>Marianne</b></font>) impatience to be at home again now returned; her (<font color='blue'><b>Marianne</b></font>) mother was
dearer to her (<font color='blue'><b>Marianne</b></font>) than ever; dearer through the very excess of her (<font color='blue'><b>Marianne</b></font>) mistaken
confidence in Willoughby, and she (<font color='blue'><b>Marianne</b></font>) was wildly urgent to be gone.
Elinor, unable herself to determine whether it were better for Marianne
to be in London or at Barton, offered no counsel of her (<font color='blue'><b>Marianne</b></font>) own except of
patience till their mother's wishes could be known; and at length she (<font color='blue'><b>Marianne</b></font>)
obtained her (<font color='blue'><b>Marianne</b></font>) sister's consent to wait for that knowledge.

<p/>Mrs. Jennings left them earlier than usual; for she (<font color='blue'><b>Jennings</b></font>) could not be easy
till the Middletons and Palmers were able to grieve as much as herself;
and positively refusing Elinor's offered attendance, went out alone for
the rest of the morning. Elinor, with a very heavy heart, aware of the
pain she (<font color='blue'><b>Elinor</b></font>) was going to communicate, and perceiving, by Marianne's
letter, how ill she (<font color='blue'><b>Marianne</b></font>) had succeeded in laying any foundation for it, then
sat down to write her (<font color='blue'><b>Marianne</b></font>) mother an account of what had passed, and entreat
her (<font color='blue'><b>Marianne</b></font>) directions for the future; while Marianne, who came into the
drawing-room on Mrs. Jennings's going away, remained fixed at the table
where Elinor wrote, watching the advancement of her (<font color='blue'><b>Elinor</b></font>) pen, grieving over
her (<font color='blue'><b>Elinor</b></font>) for the hardship of such a task, and grieving still more fondly
over its effect on her (<font color='blue'><b>Elinor</b></font>) mother.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Who can this be?''  (<font color='red'><b>Elinor/-- Elinor/ELINOR</b></font>)</div>cried Elinor. <div class="bookquote">``So early too! I thought we HAD been
safe.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/>The event proved her (<font color='blue'><b>Elinor</b></font>) conjecture right, though it was founded on
injustice and error; for Colonel Brandon DID come in; and Elinor, who
was convinced that solicitude for Marianne brought him (<font color='blue'><b>Brandon</b></font>) thither, and who
saw THAT solicitude in his (<font color='blue'><b>Brandon</b></font>) disturbed and melancholy look, and in his (<font color='blue'><b>Brandon</b></font>)
anxious though brief inquiry after her (<font color='blue'><b>Marianne</b></font>), could not forgive her (<font color='blue'><b>Marianne</b></font>) sister
for esteeming him (<font color='blue'><b>Brandon</b></font>) so lightly.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``I understand you,''  (<font color='red'><b>Elinor/-- Elinor/ELINOR</b></font>)</div>said Elinor. <div class="bookquote">``You have something to tell me of Mr.
Willoughby, that will open his (<font color='blue'><b>Willoughby</b></font>) character farther. Your telling it will
be the greatest act of friendship that can be shewn Marianne. MY
gratitude will be insured immediately by any information tending to
that end, and HERS must be gained by it in time. Pray, pray let me
hear it.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Indeed,''  (<font color='red'><b>Elinor/-- Elinor/ELINOR</b></font>)</div>answered Elinor, <div class="bookquote">``I have NOT forgotten it.''  (<font color='red'><b>Elinor/-- Elinor/ELINOR</b></font>)</div>He (<font color='blue'><b>Brandon</b></font>) looked pleased
by this remembrance, and added,

<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Brandon</b></font>) could say no more, and rising hastily walked for a few minutes about
the room. Elinor, affected by his (<font color='blue'><b>Brandon</b></font>) relation, and still more by his (<font color='blue'><b>Brandon</b></font>)
distress, could not speak. He (<font color='blue'><b>Brandon</b></font>) saw her (<font color='blue'><b>Elinor</b></font>) concern, and coming to her (<font color='blue'><b>Elinor</b></font>), took
her (<font color='blue'><b>Elinor</b></font>) hand, pressed it, and kissed it with grateful respect. A few
minutes more of silent exertion enabled him (<font color='blue'><b>Brandon</b></font>) to proceed with composure.

<p/>Again he (<font color='blue'><b>Brandon</b></font>) stopped to recover himself; and Elinor spoke her (<font color='blue'><b>Elinor</b></font>) feelings in
an exclamation of tender concern, at the fate of his (<font color='blue'><b>Brandon</b></font>) unfortunate friend.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Good heavens!''  (<font color='red'><b>Elinor/-- Elinor/ELINOR</b></font>)</div>cried Elinor, <div class="bookquote">``could it be--could Willoughby!'' (<font color='red'><b>Elinor/-- Elinor/ELINOR</b></font>)</div>--

<p/><div class="bookquote">``This is beyond every thing!''  (<font color='red'><b>Elinor/-- Elinor/ELINOR</b></font>)</div>exclaimed Elinor.

<p/>Elinor's thanks followed this speech with grateful earnestness;
attended too with the assurance of her (<font color='blue'><b>Elinor</b></font>) expecting material advantage to
Marianne, from the communication of what had passed.

<p/>Elinor, startled by his (<font color='blue'><b>Brandon</b></font>) manner, looked at him (<font color='blue'><b>Brandon</b></font>) anxiously, saying,

<p/>Elinor sighed over the fancied necessity of this; but to a man and a
soldier she (<font color='blue'><b>Elinor</b></font>) presumed not to censure it.

<p/>Recollecting, soon afterwards, that he (<font color='blue'><b>soldier</b></font>) was probably dividing Elinor
from her (<font color='blue'><b>Elinor</b></font>) sister, he (<font color='blue'><b>soldier</b></font>) put an end to his (<font color='blue'><b>soldier</b></font>) visit, receiving from her (<font color='blue'><b>Elinor</b></font>) again
the same grateful acknowledgments, and leaving her (<font color='blue'><b>Elinor</b></font>) full of compassion
and esteem for him (<font color='blue'><b>soldier</b></font>).

<p/>When the particulars of this conversation were repeated by Miss
Dashwood to her (<font color='blue'><b>Dashwood</b></font>) sister, as they very soon were, the effect on her (<font color='blue'><b>Dashwood</b></font>) was
not entirely such as the former had hoped to see. Not that Marianne
appeared to distrust the truth of any part of it, for she (<font color='blue'><b>Marianne</b></font>) listened to
it all with the most steady and submissive attention, made neither
objection nor remark, attempted no vindication of Willoughby, and
seemed to shew by her (<font color='blue'><b>Marianne</b></font>) tears that she (<font color='blue'><b>Marianne</b></font>) felt it to be impossible. But
though this behaviour assured Elinor that the conviction of this guilt
WAS carried home to her (<font color='blue'><b>Elinor</b></font>) mind, though she (<font color='blue'><b>Elinor</b></font>) saw with satisfaction the
effect of it, in her (<font color='blue'><b>Elinor</b></font>) no longer avoiding Colonel Brandon when he (<font color='blue'><b>Colonel</b></font>) called,
in her (<font color='blue'><b>Elinor</b></font>) speaking to him (<font color='blue'><b>Colonel</b></font>), even voluntarily speaking, with a kind of
compassionate respect, and though she (<font color='blue'><b>Elinor</b></font>) saw her (<font color='blue'><b>Elinor</b></font>) spirits less violently
irritated than before, she (<font color='blue'><b>Elinor</b></font>) did not see her (<font color='blue'><b>Elinor</b></font>) less wretched. Her (<font color='blue'><b>Elinor</b></font>) mind did
become settled, but it was settled in a gloomy dejection. She (<font color='blue'><b>Elinor</b></font>) felt the
loss of Willoughby's character yet more heavily than she (<font color='blue'><b>Elinor</b></font>) had felt the
loss of his (<font color='blue'><b>Willoughby</b></font>) heart; his (<font color='blue'><b>Willoughby</b></font>) seduction and desertion of Miss Williams, the
misery of that poor girl, and the doubt of what his (<font color='blue'><b>Willoughby</b></font>) designs might ONCE
have been on herself, preyed altogether so much on her (<font color='blue'><b>Williams</b></font>) spirits, that
she (<font color='blue'><b>Williams</b></font>) could not bring herself to speak of what she (<font color='blue'><b>Williams</b></font>) felt even to Elinor;
and, brooding over her (<font color='blue'><b>Elinor</b></font>) sorrows in silence, gave more pain to her (<font color='blue'><b>Elinor</b></font>) sister
than could have been communicated by the most open and most frequent
confession of them.

<p/>To give the feelings or the language of Mrs. Dashwood on receiving and
answering Elinor's letter would be only to give a repetition of what
her (<font color='blue'><b>Elinor</b></font>) daughters had already felt and said; of a disappointment hardly
less painful than Marianne's, and an indignation even greater than
Elinor's. Long letters from her (<font color='blue'><b>Elinor</b></font>), quickly succeeding each other,
arrived to tell all that she (<font color='blue'><b>Elinor</b></font>) suffered and thought; to express her (<font color='blue'><b>Elinor</b></font>)
anxious solicitude for Marianne, and entreat she (<font color='blue'><b>Marianne</b></font>) would bear up with
fortitude under this misfortune. Bad indeed must the nature of
Marianne's affliction be, when her (<font color='blue'><b>Marianne</b></font>) mother could talk of fortitude!
mortifying and humiliating must be the origin of those regrets, which
SHE could wish her (<font color='blue'><b>Marianne</b></font>) not to indulge!

<p/>But it was a matter of great consolation to her (<font color='blue'><b>Marianne</b></font>), that what brought evil
to herself would bring good to her (<font color='blue'><b>Marianne</b></font>) sister; and Elinor, on the other
hand, suspecting that it would not be in her (<font color='blue'><b>Elinor</b></font>) power to avoid Edward
entirely, comforted herself by thinking, that though their longer stay
would therefore militate against her (<font color='blue'><b>Elinor</b></font>) own happiness, it would be better
for Marianne than an immediate return into Devonshire.

<p/>Her (<font color='blue'><b>Marianne</b></font>) carefulness in guarding her (<font color='blue'><b>Marianne</b></font>) sister from ever hearing Willoughby's
name mentioned, was not thrown away. Marianne, though without knowing
it herself, reaped all its advantage; for neither Mrs. Jennings, nor
Sir John, nor even Mrs. Palmer herself, ever spoke of him (<font color='blue'><b>Willoughby</b></font>) before her (<font color='blue'><b>Palmer</b></font>).
Elinor wished that the same forbearance could have extended towards
herself, but that was impossible, and she (<font color='blue'><b>Elinor</b></font>) was obliged to listen day
after day to the indignation of them all.

<p/>The rest of Mrs. Palmer's sympathy was shewn in procuring all the
particulars in her (<font color='blue'><b>Palmer</b></font>) power of the approaching marriage, and communicating
them to Elinor. She (<font color='blue'><b>Elinor</b></font>) could soon tell at what coachmaker's the new
carriage was building, by what painter Mr. Willoughby's portrait was
drawn, and at what warehouse Miss Grey's clothes might be seen.

<p/>The calm and polite unconcern of Lady Middleton on the occasion was a
happy relief to Elinor's spirits, oppressed as they often were by the
clamorous kindness of the others. It was a great comfort to her (<font color='blue'><b>Elinor</b></font>) to be
sure of exciting no interest in ONE person at least among their circle
of friends: a great comfort to know that there was ONE who would meet
her (<font color='blue'><b>Elinor</b></font>) without feeling any curiosity after particulars, or any anxiety for
her (<font color='blue'><b>Elinor</b></font>) sister's health.

<p/>Colonel Brandon's delicate, unobtrusive enquiries were never unwelcome
to Miss Dashwood. He (<font color='blue'><b>Brandon</b></font>) had abundantly earned the privilege of intimate
discussion of her (<font color='blue'><b>Dashwood</b></font>) sister's disappointment, by the friendly zeal with
which he (<font color='blue'><b>Brandon</b></font>) had endeavoured to soften it, and they always conversed with
confidence. His (<font color='blue'><b>Brandon</b></font>) chief reward for the painful exertion of disclosing
past sorrows and present humiliations, was given in the pitying eye
with which Marianne sometimes observed him (<font color='blue'><b>Brandon</b></font>), and the gentleness of her (<font color='blue'><b>Marianne</b></font>)
voice whenever -LRB-though it did not often happen-RRB- she (<font color='blue'><b>Marianne</b></font>) was obliged, or
could oblige herself to speak to him (<font color='blue'><b>Brandon</b></font>). THESE assured him (<font color='blue'><b>Brandon</b></font>) that his (<font color='blue'><b>Brandon</b></font>)
exertion had produced an increase of good-will towards himself, and
THESE gave Elinor hopes of its being farther augmented hereafter; but
Mrs. Jennings, who knew nothing of all this, who knew only that the
Colonel continued as grave as ever, and that she (<font color='blue'><b>Jennings</b></font>) could neither prevail
on him (<font color='blue'><b>Colonel</b></font>) to make the offer himself, nor commission her (<font color='blue'><b>Jennings</b></font>) to make it for
him (<font color='blue'><b>Colonel</b></font>), began, at the end of two days, to think that, instead of
Midsummer, they would not be married till Michaelmas, and by the end of
a week that it would not be a match at all. The good understanding
between the Colonel and Miss Dashwood seemed rather to declare that the
honours of the mulberry-tree, the canal, and the yew arbour, would all
be made over to HER; and Mrs. Jennings had, for some time ceased to
think at all of Mrs. Ferrars.

<p/>Early in February, within a fortnight from the receipt of Willoughby's
letter, Elinor had the painful office of informing her (<font color='blue'><b>Elinor</b></font>) sister that he (<font color='blue'><b>Willoughby</b></font>)
was married. She (<font color='blue'><b>Elinor</b></font>) had taken care to have the intelligence conveyed to
herself, as soon as it was known that the ceremony was over, as she (<font color='blue'><b>Elinor</b></font>) was
desirous that Marianne should not receive the first notice of it from
the public papers, which she (<font color='blue'><b>Marianne</b></font>) saw her (<font color='blue'><b>Marianne</b></font>) eagerly examining every morning.

<p/>The Willoughbys left town as soon as they were married; and Elinor now
hoped, as there could be no danger of her (<font color='blue'><b>Elinor</b></font>) seeing either of them, to
prevail on her (<font color='blue'><b>Elinor</b></font>) sister, who had never yet left the house since the blow
first fell, to go out again by degrees as she (<font color='blue'><b>Elinor</b></font>) had done before.

<p/>Elinor only was sorry to see them. Their presence always gave her (<font color='blue'><b>Elinor</b></font>)
pain, and she (<font color='blue'><b>Elinor</b></font>) hardly knew how to make a very gracious return to the
overpowering delight of Lucy in finding her (<font color='blue'><b>Lucy</b></font>) STILL in town.

<p/>Elinor perfectly understood her (<font color='blue'><b>Elinor</b></font>), and was forced to use all her (<font color='blue'><b>Elinor</b></font>)
self-command to make it appear that she (<font color='blue'><b>Elinor</b></font>) did NOT.

<p/>Elinor would not humour her (<font color='blue'><b>Elinor</b></font>) by farther opposition.

<p/>Elinor, with great civility, declined the proposal. Her (<font color='blue'><b>Elinor</b></font>) sister was
perhaps laid down upon the bed, or in her (<font color='blue'><b>sister</b></font>) dressing gown, and therefore
not able to come to them.

<p/>Elinor began to find this impertinence too much for her (<font color='blue'><b>Elinor</b></font>) temper; but she (<font color='blue'><b>Elinor</b></font>)
was saved the trouble of checking it, by Lucy's sharp reprimand, which
now, as on many occasions, though it did not give much sweetness to the
manners of one sister, was of advantage in governing those of the other.

<p/>After some opposition, Marianne yielded to her (<font color='blue'><b>Marianne</b></font>) sister's entreaties, and
consented to go out with her (<font color='blue'><b>Marianne</b></font>) and Mrs. Jennings one morning for half an
hour. She (<font color='blue'><b>Jennings</b></font>) expressly conditioned, however, for paying no visits, and
would do no more than accompany them to Gray's in Sackville Street,
where Elinor was carrying on a negotiation for the exchange of a few
old-fashioned jewels of her (<font color='blue'><b>Elinor</b></font>) mother.

<p/>On ascending the stairs, the Miss Dashwoods found so many people before
them in the room, that there was not a person at liberty to tend to
their orders; and they were obliged to wait. All that could be done
was, to sit down at that end of the counter which seemed to promise the
quickest succession; one gentleman only was standing there, and it is
probable that Elinor was not without hope of exciting his (<font color='blue'><b>gentleman</b></font>) politeness to
a quicker despatch. But the correctness of his (<font color='blue'><b>gentleman</b></font>) eye, and the delicacy
of his (<font color='blue'><b>gentleman</b></font>) taste, proved to be beyond his (<font color='blue'><b>gentleman</b></font>) politeness. He (<font color='blue'><b>gentleman</b></font>) was giving orders
for a toothpick-case for himself, and till its size, shape, and
ornaments were determined, all of which, after examining and debating
for a quarter of an hour over every toothpick-case in the shop, were
finally arranged by his (<font color='blue'><b>gentleman</b></font>) own inventive fancy, he (<font color='blue'><b>gentleman</b></font>) had no leisure to
bestow any other attention on the two ladies, than what was comprised
in three or four very broad stares; a kind of notice which served to
imprint on Elinor the remembrance of a person and face, of strong,
natural, sterling insignificance, though adorned in the first style of
fashion.

<p/>Elinor lost no time in bringing her (<font color='blue'><b>Elinor</b></font>) business forward, was on the point
of concluding it, when another gentleman presented himself at her (<font color='blue'><b>Elinor</b></font>) side.
She (<font color='blue'><b>Elinor</b></font>) turned her (<font color='blue'><b>Elinor</b></font>) eyes towards his (<font color='blue'><b>gentleman</b></font>) face, and found him (<font color='blue'><b>gentleman</b></font>) with some surprise
to be her (<font color='blue'><b>Elinor</b></font>) brother.

<p/>Elinor found that he (<font color='blue'><b>gentleman</b></font>) and Fanny had been in town two days.

<p/>Elinor did feel a little ashamed of her (<font color='blue'><b>Elinor</b></font>) brother; and was not sorry to
be spared the necessity of answering him (<font color='blue'><b>brother</b></font>), by the arrival of Mrs.
Jennings's servant, who came to tell her (<font color='blue'><b>Jennings</b></font>) that his (<font color='blue'><b>servant</b></font>) mistress waited for
them at the door.

<p/>After staying with them half an hour, he (<font color='blue'><b>servant</b></font>) asked Elinor to walk with him (<font color='blue'><b>servant</b></font>)
to Conduit Street, and introduce him (<font color='blue'><b>servant</b></font>) to Sir John and Lady Middleton.
The weather was remarkably fine, and she (<font color='blue'><b>Middleton</b></font>) readily consented. As soon as
they were out of the house, his (<font color='blue'><b>servant</b></font>) enquiries began.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``I am glad of it. He (<font color='blue'><b>Willoughby</b></font>) seems a most gentlemanlike man; and I think,
Elinor, I may congratulate you on the prospect of a very respectable
establishment in life.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Two thousand a-year;''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>and then working himself up to a pitch of
enthusiastic generosity, he (<font color='blue'><b>servant</b></font>) added, <div class="bookquote">``Elinor, I wish with all my heart it
were TWICE as much, for your sake.''

 (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Indeed I believe you,''  (<font color='red'><b>Elinor/-- Elinor/ELINOR</b></font>)</div>replied Elinor; <div class="bookquote">``but I am very sure that
Colonel Brandon has not the smallest wish of marrying ME.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Elinor/-- Elinor/ELINOR</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``You are mistaken, Elinor; you are very much mistaken. A very little
trouble on your side secures him (<font color='blue'><b>Brandon</b></font>). Perhaps just at present he (<font color='blue'><b>Brandon</b></font>) may be
undecided; the smallness of your fortune may make him (<font color='blue'><b>Brandon</b></font>) hang back; his (<font color='blue'><b>Brandon</b></font>)
friends may all advise him (<font color='blue'><b>Brandon</b></font>) against it. But some of those little
attentions and encouragements which ladies can so easily give will fix
him (<font color='blue'><b>Brandon</b></font>), in spite of himself. And there can be no reason why you should
not try for him (<font color='blue'><b>Brandon</b></font>). It is not to be supposed that any prior attachment on
your side--in short, you know as to an attachment of that kind, it is
quite out of the question, the objections are insurmountable--you have
too much sense not to see all that. Colonel Brandon must be the man;
and no civility shall be wanting on my part to make him (<font color='blue'><b>Brandon</b></font>) pleased with
you and your family. It is a match that must give universal
satisfaction. In short, it is a kind of thing that'' (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>--lowering his (<font color='blue'><b>servant</b></font>)
voice to an important whisper--<div class="bookquote">``will be exceedingly welcome to ALL
PARTIES.''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>Recollecting himself, however, he (<font color='blue'><b>servant</b></font>) added, <div class="bookquote">``That is, I mean to
say--your friends are all truly anxious to see you well settled; Fanny
particularly, for she (<font color='blue'><b>Fanny</b></font>) has your interest very much at heart, I assure
you. And her (<font color='blue'><b>Fanny</b></font>) mother too, Mrs. Ferrars, a very good-natured woman, I am
sure it would give her (<font color='blue'><b>Fanny</b></font>) great pleasure; she (<font color='blue'><b>Fanny</b></font>) said as much the other day.''

 (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div><p/>Elinor would not vouchsafe any answer.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Is Mr. Edward Ferrars,''  (<font color='red'><b>Elinor/-- Elinor/ELINOR</b></font>)</div>said Elinor, with resolution, <div class="bookquote">``going to be
married?''

 (<font color='red'><b>Elinor/-- Elinor/ELINOR</b></font>)</div><p/>Elinor could only smile.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Certainly,''  (<font color='red'><b>Elinor/-- Elinor/ELINOR</b></font>)</div>said Elinor; <div class="bookquote">``and assisted by her (<font color='blue'><b>Fanny</b></font>) liberality, I hope you
may yet live to be in easy circumstances.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Elinor/-- Elinor/ELINOR</b></font>)</div><p/>Elinor kept her (<font color='blue'><b>Elinor</b></font>) concern and her (<font color='blue'><b>Elinor</b></font>) censure to herself; and was very
thankful that Marianne was not present, to share the provocation.

<p/>Having now said enough to make his (<font color='blue'><b>servant</b></font>) poverty clear, and to do away the
necessity of buying a pair of ear-rings for each of his (<font color='blue'><b>servant</b></font>) sisters, in his (<font color='blue'><b>servant</b></font>)
next visit at Gray's his (<font color='blue'><b>servant</b></font>) thoughts took a cheerfuller turn, and he (<font color='blue'><b>servant</b></font>) began
to congratulate Elinor on having such a friend as Mrs. Jennings.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Why, to be sure,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>said he (<font color='blue'><b>servant</b></font>), seeming to recollect himself, <div class="bookquote">``people have
little, have very little in their power. But, my dear Elinor, what is
the matter with Marianne?-- she (<font color='blue'><b>Elinor</b></font>) looks very unwell, has lost her (<font color='blue'><b>Elinor</b></font>) colour,
and is grown quite thin. Is she (<font color='blue'><b>Elinor</b></font>) ill?''

 (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I am sorry for that. At her (<font color='blue'><b>Elinor</b></font>) time of life, any thing of an illness
destroys the bloom for ever! Hers has been a very short one! She (<font color='blue'><b>Elinor</b></font>) was
as handsome a girl last September, as I ever saw; and as likely to
attract the man. There was something in her (<font color='blue'><b>Elinor</b></font>) style of beauty, to please
them particularly. I remember Fanny used to say that she (<font color='blue'><b>Fanny</b></font>) would marry
sooner and better than you did; not but what she (<font color='blue'><b>Fanny</b></font>) is exceedingly fond of
YOU, but so it happened to strike her (<font color='blue'><b>Fanny</b></font>). She (<font color='blue'><b>Fanny</b></font>) will be mistaken, however.
I question whether Marianne NOW, will marry a man worth more than five
or six hundred a-year, at the utmost, and I am very much deceived if
YOU do not do better. Dorsetshire! I know very little of Dorsetshire;
but, my dear Elinor, I shall be exceedingly glad to know more of it;
and I think I can answer for your having Fanny and myself among the
earliest and best pleased of your visitors.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Elinor/-- Elinor/ELINOR</b></font>)</div><p/>Elinor tried very seriously to convince him (<font color='blue'><b>servant</b></font>) that there was no
likelihood of her (<font color='blue'><b>Elinor</b></font>) marrying Colonel Brandon; but it was an expectation
of too much pleasure to himself to be relinquished, and he (<font color='blue'><b>Colonel</b></font>) was really
resolved on seeking an intimacy with that gentleman, and promoting the
marriage by every possible attention. He (<font color='blue'><b>Colonel</b></font>) had just compunction enough
for having done nothing for his (<font color='blue'><b>Colonel</b></font>) sisters himself, to be exceedingly
anxious that everybody else should do a great deal; and an offer from
Colonel Brandon, or a legacy from Mrs. Jennings, was the easiest means
of atoning for his (<font color='blue'><b>Brandon</b></font>) own neglect.

<p/>Elinor wanted very much to know, though she (<font color='blue'><b>Elinor</b></font>) did not chuse to ask,
whether Edward was then in town; but nothing would have induced Fanny
voluntarily to mention his (<font color='blue'><b>Edward</b></font>) name before her (<font color='blue'><b>Fanny</b></font>), till able to tell her (<font color='blue'><b>Fanny</b></font>) that
his (<font color='blue'><b>Edward</b></font>) marriage with Miss Morton was resolved on, or till her (<font color='blue'><b>Fanny</b></font>) husband's
expectations on Colonel Brandon were answered; because she (<font color='blue'><b>Fanny</b></font>) believed
them still so very much attached to each other, that they could not be
too sedulously divided in word and deed on every occasion. The
intelligence however, which SHE would not give, soon flowed from
another quarter. Lucy came very shortly to claim Elinor's compassion
on being unable to see Edward, though he (<font color='blue'><b>Edward</b></font>) had arrived in town with Mr.
and Mrs. Dashwood. He (<font color='blue'><b>Edward</b></font>) dared not come to Bartlett's Buildings for fear
of detection, and though their mutual impatience to meet, was not to be
told, they could do nothing at present but write.

<p/>Edward assured them himself of his (<font color='blue'><b>Edward</b></font>) being in town, within a very short
time, by twice calling in Berkeley Street. Twice was his (<font color='blue'><b>Edward</b></font>) card found on
the table, when they returned from their morning's engagements. Elinor
was pleased that he (<font color='blue'><b>Edward</b></font>) had called; and still more pleased that she (<font color='blue'><b>Elinor</b></font>) had
missed him (<font color='blue'><b>Edward</b></font>).

<p/>The Dashwoods were so prodigiously delighted with the Middletons, that,
though not much in the habit of giving anything, they determined to
give them--a dinner; and soon after their acquaintance began, invited
them to dine in Harley Street, where they had taken a very good house
for three months. Their sisters and Mrs. Jennings were invited
likewise, and John Dashwood was careful to secure Colonel Brandon, who,
always glad to be where the Miss Dashwoods were, received his (<font color='blue'><b>Colonel</b></font>) eager
civilities with some surprise, but much more pleasure. They were to
meet Mrs. Ferrars; but Elinor could not learn whether her (<font color='blue'><b>Elinor</b></font>) sons were to
be of the party. The expectation of seeing HER, however, was enough to
make her (<font color='blue'><b>Elinor</b></font>) interested in the engagement; for though she (<font color='blue'><b>Elinor</b></font>) could now meet
Edward's mother without that strong anxiety which had once promised to
attend such an introduction, though she (<font color='blue'><b>Elinor</b></font>) could now see her (<font color='blue'><b>Elinor</b></font>) with perfect
indifference as to her (<font color='blue'><b>Elinor</b></font>) opinion of herself, her (<font color='blue'><b>Elinor</b></font>) desire of being in
company with Mrs. Ferrars, her (<font color='blue'><b>Ferrars</b></font>) curiosity to know what she (<font color='blue'><b>Ferrars</b></font>) was like, was
as lively as ever.

<p/>On Elinor its effect was very different. She (<font color='blue'><b>Elinor</b></font>) began immediately to
determine, that Edward who lived with his (<font color='blue'><b>Edward</b></font>) mother, must be asked as his (<font color='blue'><b>Edward</b></font>)
mother was, to a party given by his (<font color='blue'><b>Edward</b></font>) sister; and to see him (<font color='blue'><b>Edward</b></font>) for the
first time, after all that passed, in the company of Lucy!--she (<font color='blue'><b>Lucy</b></font>) hardly
knew how she (<font color='blue'><b>Lucy</b></font>) could bear it!

<p/>Elinor could have given her (<font color='blue'><b>Elinor</b></font>) immediate relief by suggesting the
possibility of its being Miss Morton's mother, rather than her (<font color='blue'><b>Morton</b></font>) own,
whom they were about to behold; but instead of doing that, she (<font color='blue'><b>Morton</b></font>) assured
her (<font color='blue'><b>Morton</b></font>), and with great sincerity, that she (<font color='blue'><b>Morton</b></font>) did pity her (<font color='blue'><b>Morton</b></font>)--to the utter
amazement of Lucy, who, though really uncomfortable herself, hoped at
least to be an object of irrepressible envy to Elinor.

<p/>Elinor could not NOW be made unhappy by this behaviour.-- A few months
ago it would have hurt her (<font color='blue'><b>Elinor</b></font>) exceedingly; but it was not in Mrs. Ferrars'
power to distress her (<font color='blue'><b>Ferrars</b></font>) by it now;--and the difference of her (<font color='blue'><b>Ferrars</b></font>) manners to
the Miss Steeles, a difference which seemed purposely made to humble
her (<font color='blue'><b>Ferrars</b></font>) more, only amused her (<font color='blue'><b>Ferrars</b></font>). She (<font color='blue'><b>Ferrars</b></font>) could not but smile to see the
graciousness of both mother and daughter towards the very person-- for
Lucy was particularly distinguished--whom of all others, had they known
as much as she (<font color='blue'><b>Lucy</b></font>) did, they would have been most anxious to mortify; while
she (<font color='blue'><b>Lucy</b></font>) herself, who had comparatively no power to wound them, sat
pointedly slighted by both. But while she (<font color='blue'><b>Lucy</b></font>) smiled at a graciousness so
misapplied, she (<font color='blue'><b>Lucy</b></font>) could not reflect on the mean-spirited folly from which
it sprung, nor observe the studied attentions with which the Miss
Steeles courted its continuance, without thoroughly despising them all
four.

<p/>Elinor, having once delivered her (<font color='blue'><b>Elinor</b></font>) opinion on William's side, by which
she (<font color='blue'><b>Elinor</b></font>) offended Mrs. Ferrars and Fanny still more, did not see the
necessity of enforcing it by any farther assertion; and Marianne, when
called on for hers, offended them all, by declaring that she (<font color='blue'><b>Marianne</b></font>) had no
opinion to give, as she (<font color='blue'><b>Marianne</b></font>) had never thought about it.

<p/>Before her (<font color='blue'><b>Marianne</b></font>) removing from Norland, Elinor had painted a very pretty pair
of screens for her (<font color='blue'><b>Elinor</b></font>) sister-in-law, which being now just mounted and
brought home, ornamented her (<font color='blue'><b>Elinor</b></font>) present drawing room; and these screens,
catching the eye of John Dashwood on his (<font color='blue'><b>Marianne</b></font>) following the other gentlemen
into the room, were officiously handed by him (<font color='blue'><b>Marianne</b></font>) to Colonel Brandon for
his (<font color='blue'><b>Brandon</b></font>) admiration.

<p/>The Colonel, though disclaiming all pretensions to connoisseurship,
warmly admired the screens, as he (<font color='blue'><b>Colonel</b></font>) would have done any thing painted by
Miss Dashwood; and on the curiosity of the others being of course
excited, they were handed round for general inspection. Mrs. Ferrars,
not aware of their being Elinor's work, particularly requested to look
at them; and after they had received gratifying testimony of Lady
Middletons's approbation, Fanny presented them to her (<font color='blue'><b>Fanny</b></font>) mother,
considerately informing her (<font color='blue'><b>Fanny</b></font>), at the same time, that they were done by
Miss Dashwood.

<p/>Marianne could not bear this.--She (<font color='blue'><b>Marianne</b></font>) was already greatly displeased with
Mrs. Ferrars; and such ill-timed praise of another, at Elinor's
expense, though she (<font color='blue'><b>Elinor</b></font>) had not any notion of what was principally meant by
it, provoked her (<font color='blue'><b>Elinor</b></font>) immediately to say with warmth,

<p/><div class="bookquote">``This is admiration of a very particular kind!--what is Miss Morton to
us?--who knows, or who cares, for her (<font color='blue'><b>Morton</b></font>)?--it is Elinor of whom WE think
and speak.''

 (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div><p/>Fanny looked very angry too, and her (<font color='blue'><b>Fanny</b></font>) husband was all in a fright at his (<font color='blue'><b>husband</b></font>)
sister's audacity. Elinor was much more hurt by Marianne's warmth than
she (<font color='blue'><b>Elinor</b></font>) had been by what produced it; but Colonel Brandon's eyes, as they
were fixed on Marianne, declared that he (<font color='blue'><b>Colonel</b></font>) noticed only what was amiable
in it, the affectionate heart which could not bear to see a sister
slighted in the smallest point.

<p/>Marianne's feelings did not stop here. The cold insolence of Mrs.
Ferrars's general behaviour to her (<font color='blue'><b>Ferrars</b></font>) sister, seemed, to her (<font color='blue'><b>Ferrars</b></font>), to foretell
such difficulties and distresses to Elinor, as her (<font color='blue'><b>Elinor</b></font>) own wounded heart
taught her (<font color='blue'><b>Elinor</b></font>) to think of with horror; and urged by a strong impulse of
affectionate sensibility, she (<font color='blue'><b>Elinor</b></font>) moved after a moment, to her (<font color='blue'><b>Elinor</b></font>) sister's
chair, and putting one arm round her (<font color='blue'><b>Elinor</b></font>) neck, and one cheek close to hers,
said in a low, but eager, voice,

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Dear, dear Elinor, don't mind them. Don't let them make YOU unhappy.''

 (<font color='red'><b>sister</b></font>)</div><p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>Elinor</b></font>) could say no more; her (<font color='blue'><b>Elinor</b></font>) spirits were quite overcome, and hiding her (<font color='blue'><b>Elinor</b></font>)
face on Elinor's shoulder, she (<font color='blue'><b>Elinor</b></font>) burst into tears. Every body's
attention was called, and almost every body was concerned.--Colonel
Brandon rose up and went to them without knowing what he (<font color='blue'><b>Brandon</b></font>) did.--Mrs.
Jennings, with a very intelligent <div class="bookquote">``Ah! poor dear,''  (<font color='red'><b>Mrs. Jennings</b></font>)</div>immediately gave her (<font color='blue'><b>Jennings</b></font>)
her (<font color='blue'><b>Jennings</b></font>) salts; and Sir John felt so desperately enraged against the author
of this nervous distress, that he (<font color='blue'><b>author</b></font>) instantly changed his (<font color='blue'><b>author</b></font>) seat to one
close by Lucy Steele, and gave her (<font color='blue'><b>Steele</b></font>), in a whisper, a brief account of
the whole shocking affair.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Poor Marianne!''  (<font color='red'><b>brother</b></font>)</div>said her (<font color='blue'><b>Steele</b></font>) brother to Colonel Brandon, in a low voice,
as soon as he (<font color='blue'><b>Brandon</b></font>) could secure his (<font color='blue'><b>Brandon</b></font>) attention,-- <div class="bookquote">``She (<font color='blue'><b>Marianne</b></font>) has not such good
health as her (<font color='blue'><b>Marianne</b></font>) sister,--she (<font color='blue'><b>Marianne</b></font>) is very nervous,--she (<font color='blue'><b>Marianne</b></font>) has not Elinor's
constitution;--and one must allow that there is something very trying
to a young woman who HAS BEEN a beauty in the loss of her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) personal
attractions. You would not think it perhaps, but Marianne WAS
remarkably handsome a few months ago; quite as handsome as Elinor.--
Now you see it is all gone.''

 (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div><p/>Elinor's curiosity to see Mrs. Ferrars was satisfied.-- She (<font color='blue'><b>Elinor</b></font>) had found
in her (<font color='blue'><b>Elinor</b></font>) every thing that could tend to make a farther connection between
the families undesirable.-- She (<font color='blue'><b>Elinor</b></font>) had seen enough of her (<font color='blue'><b>Elinor</b></font>) pride, her (<font color='blue'><b>Elinor</b></font>)
meanness, and her (<font color='blue'><b>Elinor</b></font>) determined prejudice against herself, to comprehend
all the difficulties that must have perplexed the engagement, and
retarded the marriage, of Edward and herself, had he (<font color='blue'><b>Edward</b></font>) been otherwise
free;--and she (<font color='blue'><b>Elinor</b></font>) had seen almost enough to be thankful for her (<font color='blue'><b>Elinor</b></font>) OWN sake,
that one greater obstacle preserved her (<font color='blue'><b>Elinor</b></font>) from suffering under any other
of Mrs. Ferrars's creation, preserved her (<font color='blue'><b>Ferrars</b></font>) from all dependence upon her (<font color='blue'><b>Ferrars</b></font>)
caprice, or any solicitude for her (<font color='blue'><b>Ferrars</b></font>) good opinion. Or at least, if she (<font color='blue'><b>Ferrars</b></font>)
did not bring herself quite to rejoice in Edward's being fettered to
Lucy, she (<font color='blue'><b>Lucy</b></font>) determined, that had Lucy been more amiable, she (<font color='blue'><b>Lucy</b></font>) OUGHT to
have rejoiced.

<p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>Lucy</b></font>) wondered that Lucy's spirits could be so very much elevated by the
civility of Mrs. Ferrars;--that her (<font color='blue'><b>Ferrars</b></font>) interest and her (<font color='blue'><b>Ferrars</b></font>) vanity should so
very much blind her (<font color='blue'><b>Ferrars</b></font>) as to make the attention which seemed only paid her (<font color='blue'><b>Ferrars</b></font>)
because she (<font color='blue'><b>Ferrars</b></font>) was NOT ELINOR, appear a compliment to herself--or to allow
her (<font color='blue'><b>ELINOR</b></font>) to derive encouragement from a preference only given her (<font color='blue'><b>ELINOR</b></font>), because
her (<font color='blue'><b>ELINOR</b></font>) real situation was unknown. But that it was so, had not only been
declared by Lucy's eyes at the time, but was declared over again the
next morning more openly, for at her (<font color='blue'><b>Lucy</b></font>) particular desire, Lady Middleton
set her (<font color='blue'><b>Middleton</b></font>) down in Berkeley Street on the chance of seeing Elinor alone,
to tell her (<font color='blue'><b>Elinor</b></font>) how happy she (<font color='blue'><b>Elinor</b></font>) was.

<p/>Elinor wished to talk of something else, but Lucy still pressed her (<font color='blue'><b>Lucy</b></font>) to
own that she (<font color='blue'><b>Lucy</b></font>) had reason for her (<font color='blue'><b>Lucy</b></font>) happiness; and Elinor was obliged to go
on.--

<p/>To this Elinor had no answer to make, and did not attempt any.

<p/>Elinor tried to make a civil answer, though doubting her (<font color='blue'><b>Elinor</b></font>) own success.
But it seemed to satisfy Lucy, for she (<font color='blue'><b>Lucy</b></font>) directly replied,

<p/>But Elinor would not give her (<font color='blue'><b>Elinor</b></font>) any encouragement to hope that she (<font color='blue'><b>Elinor</b></font>) SHOULD
tell her (<font color='blue'><b>Elinor</b></font>) sister. Lucy continued.

<p/>Elinor was prevented from making any reply to this civil triumph, by
the door's being thrown open, the servant's announcing Mr. Ferrars, and
Edward's immediately walking in.

<p/>But Elinor had more to do; and so anxious was she (<font color='blue'><b>Elinor</b></font>), for his (<font color='blue'><b>Edward</b></font>) sake and her (<font color='blue'><b>Elinor</b></font>)
own, to do it well, that she (<font color='blue'><b>Elinor</b></font>) forced herself, after a moment's
recollection, to welcome him (<font color='blue'><b>Edward</b></font>), with a look and manner that were almost
easy, and almost open; and another struggle, another effort still
improved them. She (<font color='blue'><b>Elinor</b></font>) would not allow the presence of Lucy, nor the
consciousness of some injustice towards herself, to deter her (<font color='blue'><b>Lucy</b></font>) from
saying that she (<font color='blue'><b>Lucy</b></font>) was happy to see him (<font color='blue'><b>Edward</b></font>), and that she (<font color='blue'><b>Lucy</b></font>) had very much
regretted being from home, when he (<font color='blue'><b>Edward</b></font>) called before in Berkeley Street.
She (<font color='blue'><b>Lucy</b></font>) would not be frightened from paying him (<font color='blue'><b>Edward</b></font>) those attentions which, as
a friend and almost a relation, were his (<font color='blue'><b>friend</b></font>) due, by the observant eyes of
Lucy, though she (<font color='blue'><b>Lucy</b></font>) soon perceived them to be narrowly watching her (<font color='blue'><b>Lucy</b></font>).

<p/>Her (<font color='blue'><b>Lucy</b></font>) manners gave some re-assurance to Edward, and he (<font color='blue'><b>Edward</b></font>) had courage enough
to sit down; but his (<font color='blue'><b>Edward</b></font>) embarrassment still exceeded that of the ladies in
a proportion, which the case rendered reasonable, though his (<font color='blue'><b>Edward</b></font>) sex might
make it rare; for his (<font color='blue'><b>Edward</b></font>) heart had not the indifference of Lucy's, nor
could his (<font color='blue'><b>Edward</b></font>) conscience have quite the ease of Elinor's.

<p/>Lucy, with a demure and settled air, seemed determined to make no
contribution to the comfort of the others, and would not say a word;
and almost every thing that WAS said, proceeded from Elinor, who was
obliged to volunteer all the information about her (<font color='blue'><b>Elinor</b></font>) mother's health,
their coming to town, &c. which Edward ought to have inquired about,
but never did.

<p/>Edward tried to return her (<font color='blue'><b>Elinor</b></font>) kindness as it deserved, but before such
witnesses he (<font color='blue'><b>Edward</b></font>) dared not say half what he (<font color='blue'><b>Edward</b></font>) really felt. Again they all
sat down, and for a moment or two all were silent; while Marianne was
looking with the most speaking tenderness, sometimes at Edward and
sometimes at Elinor, regretting only that their delight in each other
should be checked by Lucy's unwelcome presence. Edward was the first
to speak, and it was to notice Marianne's altered looks, and express
his (<font color='blue'><b>Edward</b></font>) fear of her (<font color='blue'><b>Marianne</b></font>) not finding London agree with her (<font color='blue'><b>Marianne</b></font>).

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Oh, don't think of me!''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Marianne</b></font>) replied with spirited earnestness, though
her (<font color='blue'><b>Marianne</b></font>) eyes were filled with tears as she (<font color='blue'><b>Marianne</b></font>) spoke, <div class="bookquote">``don't think of MY
health. Elinor is well, you see. That must be enough for us both.''

 (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div><p/>This remark was not calculated to make Edward or Elinor more easy, nor
to conciliate the good will of Lucy, who looked up at Marianne with no
very benignant expression.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``I think, Elinor,''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Marianne</b></font>) presently added, <div class="bookquote">``we must employ Edward to take
care of us in our return to Barton. In a week or two, I suppose, we
shall be going; and, I trust, Edward will not be very unwilling to
accept the charge.''

 (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div><p/>Elinor was very angry, but Marianne seemed entirely insensible of the
sting; for she (<font color='blue'><b>Marianne</b></font>) calmly replied,

<p/>Marianne looked at her (<font color='blue'><b>Marianne</b></font>) steadily, and said, <div class="bookquote">``You know, Elinor, that this
is a kind of talking which I cannot bear. If you only hope to have
your assertion contradicted, as I must suppose to be the case, you
ought to recollect that I am the last person in the world to do it. I
cannot descend to be tricked out of assurances, that are not really
wanted.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Marianne/Miss Marianne</b></font>)</div><p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>Marianne</b></font>) then left the room; and Elinor dared not follow her (<font color='blue'><b>Elinor</b></font>) to say more,
for bound as she (<font color='blue'><b>Elinor</b></font>) was by her (<font color='blue'><b>Elinor</b></font>) promise of secrecy to Lucy, she (<font color='blue'><b>Lucy</b></font>) could give
no information that would convince Marianne; and painful as the
consequences of her (<font color='blue'><b>Marianne</b></font>) still continuing in an error might be, she (<font color='blue'><b>Marianne</b></font>) was
obliged to submit to it. All that she (<font color='blue'><b>Marianne</b></font>) could hope, was that Edward
would not often expose her (<font color='blue'><b>Marianne</b></font>) or himself to the distress of hearing
Marianne's mistaken warmth, nor to the repetition of any other part of
the pain that had attended their recent meeting--and this she (<font color='blue'><b>Marianne</b></font>) had every
reason to expect.

<p/>They had too much sense to be desirable companions to the former; and
by the latter they were considered with a jealous eye, as intruding on
THEIR ground, and sharing the kindness which they wanted to monopolize.
Though nothing could be more polite than Lady Middleton's behaviour to
Elinor and Marianne, she (<font color='blue'><b>Marianne</b></font>) did not really like them at all. Because they
neither flattered herself nor her (<font color='blue'><b>Marianne</b></font>) children, she (<font color='blue'><b>Marianne</b></font>) could not believe them
good-natured; and because they were fond of reading, she (<font color='blue'><b>Marianne</b></font>) fancied them
satirical: perhaps without exactly knowing what it was to be satirical;
but THAT did not signify. It was censure in common use, and easily
given.

<p/>Their presence was a restraint both on her (<font color='blue'><b>Marianne</b></font>) and on Lucy. It checked the
idleness of one, and the business of the other. Lady Middleton was
ashamed of doing nothing before them, and the flattery which Lucy was
proud to think of and administer at other times, she (<font color='blue'><b>Lucy</b></font>) feared they would
despise her (<font color='blue'><b>Lucy</b></font>) for offering. Miss Steele was the least discomposed of the
three, by their presence; and it was in their power to reconcile her (<font color='blue'><b>Steele</b></font>) to
it entirely. Would either of them only have given her (<font color='blue'><b>Steele</b></font>) a full and
minute account of the whole affair between Marianne and Mr. Willoughby,
she (<font color='blue'><b>Marianne</b></font>) would have thought herself amply rewarded for the sacrifice of the
best place by the fire after dinner, which their arrival occasioned.
But this conciliation was not granted; for though she (<font color='blue'><b>Marianne</b></font>) often threw out
expressions of pity for her (<font color='blue'><b>Marianne</b></font>) sister to Elinor, and more than once dropt
a reflection on the inconstancy of beaux before Marianne, no effect was
produced, but a look of indifference from the former, or of disgust in
the latter. An effort even yet lighter might have made her (<font color='blue'><b>Marianne</b></font>) their
friend. Would they only have laughed at her (<font color='blue'><b>Marianne</b></font>) about the Doctor! But so
little were they, anymore than the others, inclined to oblige her (<font color='blue'><b>Marianne</b></font>), that
if Sir John dined from home, she (<font color='blue'><b>John</b></font>) might spend a whole day without
hearing any other raillery on the subject, than what she (<font color='blue'><b>John</b></font>) was kind
enough to bestow on herself.

<p/>As Elinor was neither musical, nor affecting to be so, she (<font color='blue'><b>Elinor</b></font>) made no
scruple of turning her (<font color='blue'><b>Elinor</b></font>) eyes from the grand pianoforte, whenever it
suited her (<font color='blue'><b>Elinor</b></font>), and unrestrained even by the presence of a harp, and
violoncello, would fix them at pleasure on any other object in the
room. In one of these excursive glances she (<font color='blue'><b>Elinor</b></font>) perceived among a group of
young men, the very he (<font color='blue'><b>John</b></font>), who had given them a lecture on toothpick-cases
at Gray's. She (<font color='blue'><b>Elinor</b></font>) perceived him (<font color='blue'><b>Gray</b></font>) soon afterwards looking at herself, and
speaking familiarly to her (<font color='blue'><b>Elinor</b></font>) brother; and had just determined to find out
his (<font color='blue'><b>brother</b></font>) name from the latter, when they both came towards her (<font color='blue'><b>Elinor</b></font>), and Mr.
Dashwood introduced him (<font color='blue'><b>Dashwood</b></font>) to her (<font color='blue'><b>Elinor</b></font>) as Mr. Robert Ferrars.

<p/>Elinor would not oppose his (<font color='blue'><b>Ferrars</b></font>) opinion, because, whatever might be her (<font color='blue'><b>Elinor</b></font>)
general estimation of the advantage of a public school, she (<font color='blue'><b>Elinor</b></font>) could not
think of Edward's abode in Mr. Pratt's family, with any satisfaction.

<p/>Elinor set him (<font color='blue'><b>Pratt</b></font>) right as to its situation; and it seemed rather
surprising to him (<font color='blue'><b>Pratt</b></font>) that anybody could live in Devonshire, without living
near Dawlish. He (<font color='blue'><b>Pratt</b></font>) bestowed his (<font color='blue'><b>Pratt</b></font>) hearty approbation however on their
species of house.

<p/>Elinor agreed to it all, for she (<font color='blue'><b>Elinor</b></font>) did not think he (<font color='blue'><b>Pratt</b></font>) deserved the
compliment of rational opposition.

<p/>Mr. Dashwood was convinced. He (<font color='blue'><b>Dashwood</b></font>) saw the necessity of inviting the Miss
Steeles immediately, and his (<font color='blue'><b>Dashwood</b></font>) conscience was pacified by the resolution
of inviting his (<font color='blue'><b>Dashwood</b></font>) sisters another year; at the same time, however, slyly
suspecting that another year would make the invitation needless, by
bringing Elinor to town as Colonel Brandon's wife, and Marianne as
THEIR visitor.

<p/>When the note was shown to Elinor, as it was within ten minutes after
its arrival, it gave her (<font color='blue'><b>Elinor</b></font>), for the first time, some share in the
expectations of Lucy; for such a mark of uncommon kindness, vouchsafed
on so short an acquaintance, seemed to declare that the good-will
towards her (<font color='blue'><b>Lucy</b></font>) arose from something more than merely malice against
herself; and might be brought, by time and address, to do every thing
that Lucy wished. Her (<font color='blue'><b>Lucy</b></font>) flattery had already subdued the pride of Lady
Middleton, and made an entry into the close heart of Mrs. John
Dashwood; and these were effects that laid open the probability of
greater.

<p/>The Miss Steeles removed to Harley Street, and all that reached Elinor
of their influence there, strengthened her (<font color='blue'><b>Elinor</b></font>) expectation of the event.
Sir John, who called on them more than once, brought home such accounts
of the favour they were in, as must be universally striking. Mrs.
Dashwood had never been so much pleased with any young women in her (<font color='blue'><b>Dashwood</b></font>)
life, as she (<font color='blue'><b>Dashwood</b></font>) was with them; had given each of them a needle book made
by some emigrant; called Lucy by her (<font color='blue'><b>Lucy</b></font>) Christian name; and did not know
whether she (<font color='blue'><b>Lucy</b></font>) should ever be able to part with them.

<p/>About the third or fourth morning after their being thus resettled in
Berkeley Street, Mrs. Jennings, on returning from her (<font color='blue'><b>Jennings</b></font>) ordinary visit to
Mrs. Palmer, entered the drawing-room, where Elinor was sitting by
herself, with an air of such hurrying importance as prepared her (<font color='blue'><b>Elinor</b></font>) to
hear something wonderful; and giving her (<font color='blue'><b>Elinor</b></font>) time only to form that idea,
began directly to justify it, by saying,

<p/>Here Mrs. Jennings ceased, and as Elinor had had time enough to collect
her (<font color='blue'><b>Elinor</b></font>) thoughts, she (<font color='blue'><b>Elinor</b></font>) was able to give such an answer, and make such
observations, as the subject might naturally be supposed to produce.
Happy to find that she (<font color='blue'><b>Elinor</b></font>) was not suspected of any extraordinary interest
in it; that Mrs. Jennings -LRB-as she (<font color='blue'><b>Jennings</b></font>) had of late often hoped might be the
case-RRB- had ceased to imagine her (<font color='blue'><b>Jennings</b></font>) at all attached to Edward; and happy
above all the rest, in the absence of Marianne, she (<font color='blue'><b>Marianne</b></font>) felt very well able
to speak of the affair without embarrassment, and to give her (<font color='blue'><b>Marianne</b></font>) judgment,
as she (<font color='blue'><b>Marianne</b></font>) believed, with impartiality on the conduct of every one
concerned in it.

<p/>As Mrs. Jennings could talk on no other subject, Elinor soon saw the
necessity of preparing Marianne for its discussion. No time was to be
lost in undeceiving her (<font color='blue'><b>Elinor</b></font>), in making her (<font color='blue'><b>Elinor</b></font>) acquainted with the real truth,
and in endeavouring to bring her (<font color='blue'><b>Elinor</b></font>) to hear it talked of by others,
without betraying that she (<font color='blue'><b>Elinor</b></font>) felt any uneasiness for her (<font color='blue'><b>Elinor</b></font>) sister, or any
resentment against Edward.

<p/>Elinor's office was a painful one.--She (<font color='blue'><b>Elinor</b></font>) was going to remove what she (<font color='blue'><b>Elinor</b></font>)
really believed to be her (<font color='blue'><b>Elinor</b></font>) sister's chief consolation,--to give such
particulars of Edward as she (<font color='blue'><b>Elinor</b></font>) feared would ruin him (<font color='blue'><b>Edward</b></font>) for ever in her (<font color='blue'><b>Elinor</b></font>) good
opinion,-and to make Marianne, by a resemblance in their situations,
which to HER fancy would seem strong, feel all her (<font color='blue'><b>Elinor</b></font>) own disappointment
over again. But unwelcome as such a task must be, it was necessary to
be done, and Elinor therefore hastened to perform it.

<p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>Elinor</b></font>) was very far from wishing to dwell on her (<font color='blue'><b>Elinor</b></font>) own feelings, or to
represent herself as suffering much, any otherwise than as the
self-command she (<font color='blue'><b>Elinor</b></font>) had practised since her (<font color='blue'><b>Elinor</b></font>) first knowledge of Edward's
engagement, might suggest a hint of what was practicable to Marianne.
Her (<font color='blue'><b>Marianne</b></font>) narration was clear and simple; and though it could not be given
without emotion, it was not accompanied by violent agitation, nor
impetuous grief.--THAT belonged rather to the hearer, for Marianne
listened with horror, and cried excessively. Elinor was to be the
comforter of others in her (<font color='blue'><b>Elinor</b></font>) own distresses, no less than in theirs; and
all the comfort that could be given by assurances of her (<font color='blue'><b>Elinor</b></font>) own composure
of mind, and a very earnest vindication of Edward from every charge but
of imprudence, was readily offered.

<p/>But Marianne for some time would give credit to neither. Edward seemed
a second Willoughby; and acknowledging as Elinor did, that she (<font color='blue'><b>Elinor</b></font>) HAD
loved him (<font color='blue'><b>Edward</b></font>) most sincerely, could she (<font color='blue'><b>Elinor</b></font>) feel less than herself! As for
Lucy Steele, she (<font color='blue'><b>Steele</b></font>) considered her (<font color='blue'><b>Steele</b></font>) so totally unamiable, so absolutely
incapable of attaching a sensible man, that she (<font color='blue'><b>Steele</b></font>) could not be persuaded
at first to believe, and afterwards to pardon, any former affection of
Edward for her (<font color='blue'><b>Steele</b></font>). She (<font color='blue'><b>Steele</b></font>) would not even admit it to have been natural; and
Elinor left her (<font color='blue'><b>Elinor</b></font>) to be convinced that it was so, by that which only
could convince her (<font color='blue'><b>Elinor</b></font>), a better knowledge of mankind.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``How long has this been known to you, Elinor? has he (<font color='blue'><b>Edward</b></font>) written to you?''

 (<font color='red'><b>Elinor/-- Elinor/ELINOR</b></font>)</div><p/>Elinor confirmed it.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``I have very often wished to undeceive yourself and my mother,''  (<font color='red'><b>Elinor/-- Elinor/ELINOR</b></font>)</div>added
Elinor; <div class="bookquote">``and once or twice I have attempted it;--but without betraying
my trust, I never could have convinced you.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Elinor/-- Elinor/ELINOR</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Oh! Elinor,''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Elinor</b></font>) cried, <div class="bookquote">``you have made me hate myself for ever.--How
barbarous have I been to you!--you, who have been my only comfort, who
have borne with me in all my misery, who have seemed to be only
suffering for me!--Is this my gratitude?--Is this the only return I can
make you?--Because your merit cries out upon myself, I have been trying
to do it away.''

 (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div><p/>The tenderest caresses followed this confession. In such a frame of
mind as she (<font color='blue'><b>Elinor</b></font>) was now in, Elinor had no difficulty in obtaining from her (<font color='blue'><b>Elinor</b></font>)
whatever promise she (<font color='blue'><b>Elinor</b></font>) required; and at her (<font color='blue'><b>Elinor</b></font>) request, Marianne engaged
never to speak of the affair to any one with the least appearance of
bitterness;--to meet Lucy without betraying the smallest increase of
dislike to her (<font color='blue'><b>Lucy</b></font>);--and even to see Edward himself, if chance should bring
them together, without any diminution of her (<font color='blue'><b>Lucy</b></font>) usual cordiality.-- These
were great concessions;--but where Marianne felt that she (<font color='blue'><b>Marianne</b></font>) had injured,
no reparation could be too much for her (<font color='blue'><b>Marianne</b></font>) to make.

<p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>Marianne</b></font>) performed her (<font color='blue'><b>Marianne</b></font>) promise of being discreet, to admiration.--She (<font color='blue'><b>Marianne</b></font>)
attended to all that Mrs. Jennings had to say upon the subject, with an
unchanging complexion, dissented from her (<font color='blue'><b>Jennings</b></font>) in nothing, and was heard
three times to say, <div class="bookquote">``Yes, ma'am.'' (<font color='red'><b>Mrs. Jennings</b></font>)</div>--She (<font color='blue'><b>Jennings</b></font>) listened to her (<font color='blue'><b>Jennings</b></font>) praise of Lucy
with only moving from one chair to another, and when Mrs. Jennings
talked of Edward's affection, it cost her (<font color='blue'><b>Jennings</b></font>) only a spasm in her (<font color='blue'><b>Jennings</b></font>)
throat.--Such advances towards heroism in her (<font color='blue'><b>Jennings</b></font>) sister, made Elinor feel
equal to any thing herself.

<p/>Marianne sighed out her (<font color='blue'><b>Marianne</b></font>) similar apprehension; and Elinor's heart wrung
for the feelings of Edward, while braving his (<font color='blue'><b>Edward</b></font>) mother's threats, for a
woman who could not reward him (<font color='blue'><b>Edward</b></font>).

<p/>Elinor's heart thanked her (<font color='blue'><b>Elinor</b></font>) for such kindness towards Edward, though she (<font color='blue'><b>Elinor</b></font>)
could not forbear smiling at the form of it.

<p/>Marianne's indignation burst forth as soon as he (<font color='blue'><b>Edward</b></font>) quitted the room; and
as her (<font color='blue'><b>Marianne</b></font>) vehemence made reserve impossible in Elinor, and unnecessary in
Mrs. Jennings, they all joined in a very spirited critique upon the
party.

<p/>Mrs. Jennings was very warm in her (<font color='blue'><b>Jennings</b></font>) praise of Edward's conduct, but only
Elinor and Marianne understood its true merit. THEY only knew how
little he (<font color='blue'><b>Edward</b></font>) had had to tempt him (<font color='blue'><b>Edward</b></font>) to be disobedient, and how small was the
consolation, beyond the consciousness of doing right, that could remain
to him (<font color='blue'><b>Edward</b></font>) in the loss of friends and fortune. Elinor gloried in his (<font color='blue'><b>Edward</b></font>)
integrity; and Marianne forgave all his (<font color='blue'><b>Edward</b></font>) offences in compassion for his (<font color='blue'><b>Edward</b></font>)
punishment. But though confidence between them was, by this public
discovery, restored to its proper state, it was not a subject on which
either of them were fond of dwelling when alone. Elinor avoided it
upon principle, as tending to fix still more upon her (<font color='blue'><b>Elinor</b></font>) thoughts, by the
too warm, too positive assurances of Marianne, that belief of Edward's
continued affection for herself which she (<font color='blue'><b>Marianne</b></font>) rather wished to do away; and
Marianne's courage soon failed her (<font color='blue'><b>Marianne</b></font>), in trying to converse upon a topic
which always left her (<font color='blue'><b>Marianne</b></font>) more dissatisfied with herself than ever, by the
comparison it necessarily produced between Elinor's conduct and her (<font color='blue'><b>Elinor</b></font>) own.

<p/>The third day succeeding their knowledge of the particulars, was so
fine, so beautiful a Sunday as to draw many to Kensington Gardens,
though it was only the second week in March. Mrs. Jennings and Elinor
were of the number; but Marianne, who knew that the Willoughbys were
again in town, and had a constant dread of meeting them, chose rather
to stay at home, than venture into so public a place.

<p/>An intimate acquaintance of Mrs. Jennings joined them soon after they
entered the Gardens, and Elinor was not sorry that by her (<font color='blue'><b>Elinor</b></font>) continuing
with them, and engaging all Mrs. Jennings's conversation, she (<font color='blue'><b>Jennings</b></font>) was
herself left to quiet reflection. She (<font color='blue'><b>Jennings</b></font>) saw nothing of the Willoughbys,
nothing of Edward, and for some time nothing of anybody who could by
any chance whether grave or gay, be interesting to her (<font color='blue'><b>Jennings</b></font>). But at last
she (<font color='blue'><b>Jennings</b></font>) found herself with some surprise, accosted by Miss Steele, who,
though looking rather shy, expressed great satisfaction in meeting
them, and on receiving encouragement from the particular kindness of
Mrs. Jennings, left her (<font color='blue'><b>Jennings</b></font>) own party for a short time, to join their's.
Mrs. Jennings immediately whispered to Elinor,

<p/>It was lucky, however, for Mrs. Jennings's curiosity and Elinor's too,
that she (<font color='blue'><b>Elinor</b></font>) would tell any thing WITHOUT being asked; for nothing would
otherwise have been learnt.

<p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>Elinor</b></font>) had wandered away to a subject on which Elinor had nothing to say,
and therefore soon judged it expedient to find her (<font color='blue'><b>Elinor</b></font>) way back again to
the first.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``I never heard any thing of the kind hinted at before, I assure you,''
 (<font color='red'><b>Elinor/-- Elinor/ELINOR</b></font>)</div>said Elinor.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``I do not understand what you mean by interrupting them,''  (<font color='red'><b>Elinor/-- Elinor/ELINOR</b></font>)</div>said Elinor;
<div class="bookquote">``you were all in the same room together, were not you?''

 (<font color='red'><b>Elinor/-- Elinor/ELINOR</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``How!''  (<font color='red'><b>Elinor/-- Elinor/ELINOR</b></font>)</div>cried Elinor; <div class="bookquote">``have you been repeating to me what you only
learnt yourself by listening at the door? I am sorry I did not know it
before; for I certainly would not have suffered you to give me
particulars of a conversation which you ought not to have known
yourself. How could you behave so unfairly by your sister?''

 (<font color='red'><b>Elinor/-- Elinor/ELINOR</b></font>)</div><p/>Elinor tried to talk of something else; but Miss Steele could not be
kept beyond a couple of minutes, from what was uppermost in her (<font color='blue'><b>Elinor</b></font>) mind.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Well,''  (<font color='red'><b>Elinor/-- Elinor/ELINOR</b></font>)</div>said Elinor, <div class="bookquote">``it is a comfort to be prepared against the worst.
You have got your answer ready.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Elinor/-- Elinor/ELINOR</b></font>)</div><p/>Such was her (<font color='blue'><b>Elinor</b></font>) parting concern; for after this, she (<font color='blue'><b>Elinor</b></font>) had time only to pay
her (<font color='blue'><b>Elinor</b></font>) farewell compliments to Mrs. Jennings, before her (<font color='blue'><b>Jennings</b></font>) company was
claimed by Mrs. Richardson; and Elinor was left in possession of
knowledge which might feed her (<font color='blue'><b>Elinor</b></font>) powers of reflection some time, though
she (<font color='blue'><b>Elinor</b></font>) had learnt very little more than what had been already foreseen and
foreplanned in her (<font color='blue'><b>Elinor</b></font>) own mind. Edward's marriage with Lucy was as firmly
determined on, and the time of its taking place remained as absolutely
uncertain, as she (<font color='blue'><b>Lucy</b></font>) had concluded it would be;--every thing depended,
exactly after her (<font color='blue'><b>Lucy</b></font>) expectation, on his (<font color='blue'><b>Edward</b></font>) getting that preferment, of
which, at present, there seemed not the smallest chance.

<p/>As soon as they returned to the carriage, Mrs. Jennings was eager for
information; but as Elinor wished to spread as little as possible
intelligence that had in the first place been so unfairly obtained, she (<font color='blue'><b>Elinor</b></font>)
confined herself to the brief repetition of such simple particulars, as
she (<font color='blue'><b>Elinor</b></font>) felt assured that Lucy, for the sake of her (<font color='blue'><b>Lucy</b></font>) own consequence, would
choose to have known. The continuance of their engagement, and the
means that were able to be taken for promoting its end, was all her (<font color='blue'><b>Lucy</b></font>)
communication; and this produced from Mrs. Jennings the following
natural remark.

<p/>The next morning brought Elinor a letter by the two-penny post from
Lucy herself. It was as follows:

<p/>As soon as Elinor had finished it, she (<font color='blue'><b>Elinor</b></font>) performed what she (<font color='blue'><b>Elinor</b></font>) concluded to
be its writer's real design, by placing it in the hands of Mrs.
Jennings, who read it aloud with many comments of satisfaction and
praise.

<p/>The Miss Dashwoods had now been rather more than two months in town,
and Marianne's impatience to be gone increased every day. She (<font color='blue'><b>Marianne</b></font>) sighed
for the air, the liberty, the quiet of the country; and fancied that if
any place could give her (<font color='blue'><b>Marianne</b></font>) ease, Barton must do it. Elinor was hardly
less anxious than herself for their removal, and only so much less bent
on its being effected immediately, as that she (<font color='blue'><b>Elinor</b></font>) was conscious of the
difficulties of so long a journey, which Marianne could not be brought
to acknowledge. She (<font color='blue'><b>Marianne</b></font>) began, however, seriously to turn her (<font color='blue'><b>Marianne</b></font>) thoughts
towards its accomplishment, and had already mentioned their wishes to
their kind hostess, who resisted them with all the eloquence of her (<font color='blue'><b>hostess</b></font>)
good-will, when a plan was suggested, which, though detaining them from
home yet a few weeks longer, appeared to Elinor altogether much more
eligible than any other. The Palmers were to remove to Cleveland about
the end of March, for the Easter holidays; and Mrs. Jennings, with both
her (<font color='blue'><b>Jennings</b></font>) friends, received a very warm invitation from Charlotte to go with
them. This would not, in itself, have been sufficient for the delicacy
of Miss Dashwood;--but it was inforced with so much real politeness by
Mr. Palmer himself, as, joined to the very great amendment of his (<font color='blue'><b>Palmer</b></font>)
manners towards them since her (<font color='blue'><b>Dashwood</b></font>) sister had been known to be unhappy,
induced her (<font color='blue'><b>Dashwood</b></font>) to accept it with pleasure.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``You forget,''  (<font color='red'><b>Elinor/-- Elinor/ELINOR</b></font>)</div>said Elinor gently, <div class="bookquote">``that its situation is not...that it
is not in the neighbourhood of...''

 (<font color='red'><b>Elinor/-- Elinor/ELINOR</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``But it is in Somersetshire.--I cannot go into Somersetshire.--There,
where I looked forward to going...No, Elinor, you cannot expect me to
go there.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Elinor/-- Elinor/ELINOR</b></font>)</div><p/>Elinor would not argue upon the propriety of overcoming such
feelings;--she (<font color='blue'><b>Elinor</b></font>) only endeavoured to counteract them by working on
others;--represented it, therefore, as a measure which would fix the
time of her (<font color='blue'><b>Elinor</b></font>) returning to that dear mother, whom she (<font color='blue'><b>Elinor</b></font>) so much wished to
see, in a more eligible, more comfortable manner, than any other plan
could do, and perhaps without any greater delay. From Cleveland, which
was within a few miles of Bristol, the distance to Barton was not
beyond one day, though a long day's journey; and their mother's servant
might easily come there to attend them down; and as there could be no
occasion of their staying above a week at Cleveland, they might now be
at home in little more than three weeks' time. As Marianne's affection
for her (<font color='blue'><b>Marianne</b></font>) mother was sincere, it must triumph with little difficulty,
over the imaginary evils she (<font color='blue'><b>Marianne</b></font>) had started.

<p/>Mrs. Jennings was so far from being weary of her (<font color='blue'><b>Jennings</b></font>) guests, that she (<font color='blue'><b>Jennings</b></font>)
pressed them very earnestly to return with her (<font color='blue'><b>Jennings</b></font>) again from Cleveland.
Elinor was grateful for the attention, but it could not alter her (<font color='blue'><b>Elinor</b></font>)
design; and their mother's concurrence being readily gained, every
thing relative to their return was arranged as far as it could be;--and
Marianne found some relief in drawing up a statement of the hours that
were yet to divide her (<font color='blue'><b>Marianne</b></font>) from Barton.

<p/>Perhaps Mrs. Jennings was in hopes, by this vigorous sketch of their
future ennui, to provoke him (<font color='blue'><b>Barton</b></font>) to make that offer, which might give
himself an escape from it;--and if so, she (<font color='blue'><b>Jennings</b></font>) had soon afterwards good
reason to think her (<font color='blue'><b>Jennings</b></font>) object gained; for, on Elinor's moving to the
window to take more expeditiously the dimensions of a print, which she (<font color='blue'><b>Elinor</b></font>)
was going to copy for her (<font color='blue'><b>Elinor</b></font>) friend, he (<font color='blue'><b>friend</b></font>) followed her (<font color='blue'><b>Elinor</b></font>) to it with a look of
particular meaning, and conversed with her (<font color='blue'><b>Elinor</b></font>) there for several minutes.
The effect of his (<font color='blue'><b>friend</b></font>) discourse on the lady too, could not escape her (<font color='blue'><b>Elinor</b></font>)
observation, for though she (<font color='blue'><b>Elinor</b></font>) was too honorable to listen, and had even
changed her (<font color='blue'><b>Elinor</b></font>) seat, on purpose that she (<font color='blue'><b>Elinor</b></font>) might NOT hear, to one close by
the piano forte on which Marianne was playing, she (<font color='blue'><b>Marianne</b></font>) could not keep
herself from seeing that Elinor changed colour, attended with
agitation, and was too intent on what he (<font color='blue'><b>friend</b></font>) said to pursue her (<font color='blue'><b>Elinor</b></font>)
employment.-- Still farther in confirmation of her (<font color='blue'><b>Elinor</b></font>) hopes, in the
interval of Marianne's turning from one lesson to another, some words
of the Colonel's inevitably reached her (<font color='blue'><b>Marianne</b></font>) ear, in which he (<font color='blue'><b>Colonel</b></font>) seemed to be
apologising for the badness of his (<font color='blue'><b>Colonel</b></font>) house. This set the matter beyond a
doubt. She (<font color='blue'><b>Marianne</b></font>) wondered, indeed, at his (<font color='blue'><b>Colonel</b></font>) thinking it necessary to do so;
but supposed it to be the proper etiquette. What Elinor said in reply
she (<font color='blue'><b>Elinor</b></font>) could not distinguish, but judged from the motion of her (<font color='blue'><b>Elinor</b></font>) lips, that
she (<font color='blue'><b>Elinor</b></font>) did not think THAT any material objection;--and Mrs. Jennings
commended her (<font color='blue'><b>Jennings</b></font>) in her (<font color='blue'><b>Jennings</b></font>) heart for being so honest. They then talked on
for a few minutes longer without her (<font color='blue'><b>Jennings</b></font>) catching a syllable, when another
lucky stop in Marianne's performance brought her (<font color='blue'><b>Jennings</b></font>) these words in the
Colonel's calm voice,--

<p/>This delay on the Colonel's side, however, did not seem to offend or
mortify his (<font color='blue'><b>Colonel</b></font>) fair companion in the least, for on their breaking up the
conference soon afterwards, and moving different ways, Mrs. Jennings
very plainly heard Elinor say, and with a voice which shewed her (<font color='blue'><b>Elinor</b></font>) to
feel what she (<font color='blue'><b>Elinor</b></font>) said,

<p/>Elinor told him (<font color='blue'><b>Colonel</b></font>) that it was.

<p/>Elinor's astonishment at this commission could hardly have been
greater, had the Colonel been really making her (<font color='blue'><b>Elinor</b></font>) an offer of his (<font color='blue'><b>Colonel</b></font>) hand.
The preferment, which only two days before she (<font color='blue'><b>Elinor</b></font>) had considered as
hopeless for Edward, was already provided to enable him (<font color='blue'><b>Edward</b></font>) to marry;--and
SHE, of all people in the world, was fixed on to bestow it!--Her (<font color='blue'><b>Elinor</b></font>)
emotion was such as Mrs. Jennings had attributed to a very different
cause;--but whatever minor feelings less pure, less pleasing, might
have a share in that emotion, her (<font color='blue'><b>Jennings</b></font>) esteem for the general benevolence,
and her (<font color='blue'><b>Jennings</b></font>) gratitude for the particular friendship, which together
prompted Colonel Brandon to this act, were strongly felt, and warmly
expressed. She (<font color='blue'><b>Jennings</b></font>) thanked him (<font color='blue'><b>Colonel</b></font>) for it with all her (<font color='blue'><b>Jennings</b></font>) heart, spoke of
Edward's principles and disposition with that praise which she (<font color='blue'><b>Jennings</b></font>) knew
them to deserve; and promised to undertake the commission with
pleasure, if it were really his (<font color='blue'><b>Edward</b></font>) wish to put off so agreeable an office
to another. But at the same time, she (<font color='blue'><b>Jennings</b></font>) could not help thinking that no
one could so well perform it as himself. It was an office in short,
from which, unwilling to give Edward the pain of receiving an
obligation from HER, she (<font color='blue'><b>Jennings</b></font>) would have been very glad to be spared
herself;-- but Colonel Brandon, on motives of equal delicacy, declining
it likewise, still seemed so desirous of its being given through her (<font color='blue'><b>Jennings</b></font>)
means, that she (<font color='blue'><b>Jennings</b></font>) would not on any account make farther opposition.
Edward, she (<font color='blue'><b>Jennings</b></font>) believed, was still in town, and fortunately she (<font color='blue'><b>Jennings</b></font>) had heard
his (<font color='blue'><b>Edward</b></font>) address from Miss Steele. She (<font color='blue'><b>Steele</b></font>) could undertake therefore to inform
him (<font color='blue'><b>Edward</b></font>) of it, in the course of the day. After this had been settled,
Colonel Brandon began to talk of his (<font color='blue'><b>Brandon</b></font>) own advantage in securing so
respectable and agreeable a neighbour, and THEN it was that he (<font color='blue'><b>Brandon</b></font>)
mentioned with regret, that the house was small and indifferent;--an
evil which Elinor, as Mrs. Jennings had supposed her (<font color='blue'><b>Jennings</b></font>) to do, made very
light of, at least as far as regarded its size.

<p/>Such was the sentence which, when misunderstood, so justly offended the
delicate feelings of Mrs. Jennings; but after this narration of what
really passed between Colonel Brandon and Elinor, while they stood at
the window, the gratitude expressed by the latter on their parting, may
perhaps appear in general, not less reasonably excited, nor less
properly worded than if it had arisen from an offer of marriage.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Thank you, ma'am,''  (<font color='red'><b>Elinor/-- Elinor/ELINOR</b></font>)</div>said Elinor. <div class="bookquote">``It is a matter of great joy to me;
and I feel the goodness of Colonel Brandon most sensibly. There are
not many men who would act as he (<font color='blue'><b>Brandon</b></font>) has done. Few people who have so
compassionate a heart! I never was more astonished in my life.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``You mean to go to Delaford after them I suppose,''  (<font color='red'><b>Elinor/-- Elinor/ELINOR</b></font>)</div>said Elinor, with a
faint smile.

<p/>Elinor did not quite understand the beginning of Mrs. Jennings's
speech, neither did she (<font color='blue'><b>Elinor</b></font>) think it worth inquiring into; and therefore
only replied to its conclusion.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Certainly, ma'am,''  (<font color='red'><b>Elinor/-- Elinor/ELINOR</b></font>)</div>replied Elinor, not hearing much of what she (<font color='blue'><b>Elinor</b></font>) said,
and more anxious to be alone, than to be mistress of the subject.

<p/>Elinor had just been congratulating herself, in the midst of her (<font color='blue'><b>Elinor</b></font>)
perplexity, that however difficult it might be to express herself
properly by letter, it was at least preferable to giving the
information by word of mouth, when her (<font color='blue'><b>Elinor</b></font>) visitor entered, to force her (<font color='blue'><b>Elinor</b></font>)
upon this greatest exertion of all. Her (<font color='blue'><b>Elinor</b></font>) astonishment and confusion
were very great on his (<font color='blue'><b>visitor</b></font>) so sudden appearance. She (<font color='blue'><b>Elinor</b></font>) had not seen him (<font color='blue'><b>visitor</b></font>)
before since his (<font color='blue'><b>visitor</b></font>) engagement became public, and therefore not since his (<font color='blue'><b>visitor</b></font>)
knowing her (<font color='blue'><b>Elinor</b></font>) to be acquainted with it; which, with the consciousness of
what she (<font color='blue'><b>Elinor</b></font>) had been thinking of, and what she (<font color='blue'><b>Elinor</b></font>) had to tell him (<font color='blue'><b>visitor</b></font>), made her (<font color='blue'><b>Elinor</b></font>)
feel particularly uncomfortable for some minutes. He (<font color='blue'><b>visitor</b></font>) too was much
distressed; and they sat down together in a most promising state of
embarrassment.--Whether he (<font color='blue'><b>visitor</b></font>) had asked her (<font color='blue'><b>Elinor</b></font>) pardon for his (<font color='blue'><b>visitor</b></font>) intrusion on
first coming into the room, he (<font color='blue'><b>visitor</b></font>) could not recollect; but determining to
be on the safe side, he (<font color='blue'><b>visitor</b></font>) made his (<font color='blue'><b>visitor</b></font>) apology in form as soon as he (<font color='blue'><b>visitor</b></font>) could
say any thing, after taking a chair.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``You would not have gone, however,''  (<font color='red'><b>Elinor/-- Elinor/ELINOR</b></font>)</div>said Elinor, recovering herself,
and determined to get over what she (<font color='blue'><b>Elinor</b></font>) so much dreaded as soon as
possible, <div class="bookquote">``without receiving our good wishes, even if we had not been
able to give them in person. Mrs. Jennings was quite right in what she (<font color='blue'><b>Jennings</b></font>)
said. I have something of consequence to inform you of, which I was on
the point of communicating by paper. I am charged with a most
agreeable office -LRB-breathing rather faster than usual as she (<font color='blue'><b>Jennings</b></font>) spoke.-RRB-
Colonel Brandon, who was here only ten minutes ago, has desired me to
say, that understanding you mean to take orders, he (<font color='blue'><b>Brandon</b></font>) has great pleasure
in offering you the living of Delaford now just vacant, and only wishes
it were more valuable. Allow me to congratulate you on having so
respectable and well-judging a friend, and to join in his (<font color='blue'><b>friend</b></font>) wish that the
living--it is about two hundred a-year--were much more considerable,
and such as might better enable you to--as might be more than a
temporary accommodation to yourself--such, in short, as might establish
all your views of happiness.''

 (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Yes,''  (<font color='red'><b>Elinor/-- Elinor/ELINOR</b></font>)</div>continued Elinor, gathering more resolution, as some of the
worst was over, <div class="bookquote">``Colonel Brandon means it as a testimony of his (<font color='blue'><b>Brandon</b></font>) concern
for what has lately passed--for the cruel situation in which the
unjustifiable conduct of your family has placed you--a concern which I
am sure Marianne, myself, and all your friends, must share; and
likewise as a proof of his (<font color='blue'><b>Brandon</b></font>) high esteem for your general character, and
his (<font color='blue'><b>Brandon</b></font>) particular approbation of your behaviour on the present occasion.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Elinor/-- Elinor/ELINOR</b></font>)</div><p/>Truth obliged her (<font color='blue'><b>Elinor</b></font>) to acknowledge some small share in the action, but
she (<font color='blue'><b>Elinor</b></font>) was at the same time so unwilling to appear as the benefactress of
Edward, that she (<font color='blue'><b>Elinor</b></font>) acknowledged it with hesitation; which probably
contributed to fix that suspicion in his (<font color='blue'><b>Edward</b></font>) mind which had recently
entered it. For a short time he (<font color='blue'><b>Edward</b></font>) sat deep in thought, after Elinor had
ceased to speak;--at last, and as if it were rather an effort, he (<font color='blue'><b>Edward</b></font>) said,

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Indeed,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>replied Elinor, <div class="bookquote">``I believe that you will find him (<font color='blue'><b>Brandon</b></font>), on farther
acquaintance, all that you have heard him (<font color='blue'><b>Brandon</b></font>) to be, and as you will be
such very near neighbours -LRB-for I understand the parsonage is almost
close to the mansion-house,-RRB- it is particularly important that he (<font color='blue'><b>Brandon</b></font>)
SHOULD be all this.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Elinor/-- Elinor/ELINOR</b></font>)</div><p/>Elinor told him (<font color='blue'><b>Edward</b></font>) the number of the house.

<p/>Elinor did not offer to detain him (<font color='blue'><b>Edward</b></font>); and they parted, with a very
earnest assurance on HER side of her (<font color='blue'><b>Elinor</b></font>) unceasing good wishes for his (<font color='blue'><b>Edward</b></font>)
happiness in every change of situation that might befall him (<font color='blue'><b>Edward</b></font>); on HIS (<font color='blue'><b>Edward</b></font>),
with rather an attempt to return the same good will, than the power of
expressing it.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``When I see him (<font color='blue'><b>Brandon</b></font>) again,''  (<font color='red'><b>Elinor/-- Elinor/ELINOR</b></font>)</div>said Elinor to herself, as the door shut him (<font color='blue'><b>Edward</b></font>)
out, <div class="bookquote">``I shall see him (<font color='blue'><b>Brandon</b></font>) the husband of Lucy.''

 (<font color='red'><b>him</b></font>)</div><p/>When Mrs. Jennings came home, though she (<font color='blue'><b>Jennings</b></font>) returned from seeing people
whom she (<font color='blue'><b>Jennings</b></font>) had never seen before, and of whom therefore she (<font color='blue'><b>Jennings</b></font>) must have a
great deal to say, her (<font color='blue'><b>Jennings</b></font>) mind was so much more occupied by the important
secret in her (<font color='blue'><b>Jennings</b></font>) possession, than by anything else, that she (<font color='blue'><b>Jennings</b></font>) reverted to
it again as soon as Elinor appeared.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Really,''  (<font color='red'><b>Elinor/-- Elinor/ELINOR</b></font>)</div>said Elinor, <div class="bookquote">``I know so little of these kind of forms, that I
can hardly even conjecture as to the time, or the preparation
necessary; but I suppose two or three months will complete his (<font color='blue'><b>Brandon</b></font>)
ordination.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Elinor/-- Elinor/ELINOR</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``My dear ma'am,''  (<font color='red'><b>Elinor/-- Elinor/ELINOR</b></font>)</div>said Elinor, <div class="bookquote">``what can you be thinking of?-- Why,
Colonel Brandon's only object is to be of use to Mr. Ferrars.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Elinor/-- Elinor/ELINOR</b></font>)</div><p/>Elinor was quite of her (<font color='blue'><b>Elinor</b></font>) opinion, as to the probability of their not
waiting for any thing more.

<p/>Her (<font color='blue'><b>Elinor</b></font>) own happiness, and her (<font color='blue'><b>Elinor</b></font>) own spirits, were at least very certain; and
she (<font color='blue'><b>Elinor</b></font>) joined Mrs. Jennings most heartily in her (<font color='blue'><b>Elinor</b></font>) expectation of their
being all comfortably together in Delaford Parsonage before Michaelmas.
So far was she (<font color='blue'><b>Elinor</b></font>), at the same time, from any backwardness to give Elinor
that credit which Edward WOULD give her (<font color='blue'><b>Elinor</b></font>), that she (<font color='blue'><b>Elinor</b></font>) spoke of her (<font color='blue'><b>Elinor</b></font>)
friendship for them both with the most grateful warmth, was ready to
own all their obligation to her (<font color='blue'><b>Elinor</b></font>), and openly declared that no exertion
for their good on Miss Dashwood's part, either present or future, would
ever surprise her (<font color='blue'><b>Dashwood</b></font>), for she (<font color='blue'><b>Dashwood</b></font>) believed her (<font color='blue'><b>Dashwood</b></font>) capable of doing any thing in
the world for those she (<font color='blue'><b>Dashwood</b></font>) really valued. As for Colonel Brandon, she (<font color='blue'><b>Dashwood</b></font>) was
not only ready to worship him (<font color='blue'><b>Brandon</b></font>) as a saint, but was moreover truly
anxious that he (<font color='blue'><b>Brandon</b></font>) should be treated as one in all worldly concerns;
anxious that his (<font color='blue'><b>Brandon</b></font>) tithes should be raised to the utmost; and scarcely
resolved to avail herself, at Delaford, as far as she (<font color='blue'><b>Dashwood</b></font>) possibly could,
of his (<font color='blue'><b>Brandon</b></font>) servants, his (<font color='blue'><b>Brandon</b></font>) carriage, his (<font color='blue'><b>Brandon</b></font>) cows, and his (<font color='blue'><b>Brandon</b></font>) poultry.

<p/>It was now above a week since John Dashwood had called in Berkeley
Street, and as since that time no notice had been taken by them of his (<font color='blue'><b>Brandon</b></font>)
wife's indisposition, beyond one verbal enquiry, Elinor began to feel
it necessary to pay her (<font color='blue'><b>Elinor</b></font>) a visit.--This was an obligation, however,
which not only opposed her (<font color='blue'><b>Elinor</b></font>) own inclination, but which had not the
assistance of any encouragement from her (<font color='blue'><b>Elinor</b></font>) companions. Marianne, not
contented with absolutely refusing to go herself, was very urgent to
prevent her (<font color='blue'><b>Marianne</b></font>) sister's going at all; and Mrs. Jennings, though her (<font color='blue'><b>Jennings</b></font>)
carriage was always at Elinor's service, so very much disliked Mrs.
John Dashwood, that not even her (<font color='blue'><b>Dashwood</b></font>) curiosity to see how she (<font color='blue'><b>Dashwood</b></font>) looked after
the late discovery, nor her (<font color='blue'><b>Dashwood</b></font>) strong desire to affront her (<font color='blue'><b>Dashwood</b></font>) by taking
Edward's part, could overcome her (<font color='blue'><b>Dashwood</b></font>) unwillingness to be in her (<font color='blue'><b>Dashwood</b></font>) company
again. The consequence was, that Elinor set out by herself to pay a
visit, for which no one could really have less inclination, and to run
the risk of a tete-a-tete with a woman, whom neither of the others had
so much reason to dislike.

<p/>Mrs. Dashwood was denied; but before the carriage could turn from the
house, her (<font color='blue'><b>Dashwood</b></font>) husband accidentally came out. He (<font color='blue'><b>husband</b></font>) expressed great pleasure
in meeting Elinor, told her (<font color='blue'><b>Elinor</b></font>) that he (<font color='blue'><b>husband</b></font>) had been just going to call in
Berkeley Street, and, assuring her (<font color='blue'><b>Elinor</b></font>) that Fanny would be very glad to see
her (<font color='blue'><b>Fanny</b></font>), invited her (<font color='blue'><b>Fanny</b></font>) to come in.

<p/>Elinor made what excuse she (<font color='blue'><b>Elinor</b></font>) could for her (<font color='blue'><b>Elinor</b></font>).

<p/>Elinor contradicted it, however, very positively; and by relating that
she (<font color='blue'><b>Elinor</b></font>) had herself been employed in conveying the offer from Colonel
Brandon to Edward, and, therefore, must understand the terms on which
it was given, obliged him (<font color='blue'><b>Edward</b></font>) to submit to her (<font color='blue'><b>Elinor</b></font>) authority.

<p/>Elinor had some difficulty here to refrain from observing, that she (<font color='blue'><b>Elinor</b></font>)
thought Fanny might have borne with composure, an acquisition of wealth
to her (<font color='blue'><b>Fanny</b></font>) brother, by which neither she (<font color='blue'><b>Fanny</b></font>) nor her (<font color='blue'><b>Fanny</b></font>) child could be possibly
impoverished.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Ah! Elinor,''  (<font color='red'><b>Mrs. Dashwood/John/Mrs. John Dashwood</b></font>)</div>said John, <div class="bookquote">``your reasoning is very good, but it is
founded on ignorance of human nature. When Edward's unhappy match
takes place, depend upon it his (<font color='blue'><b>Edward</b></font>) mother will feel as much as if she (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) had
never discarded him (<font color='blue'><b>Edward</b></font>); and, therefore every circumstance that may
accelerate that dreadful event, must be concealed from her (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) as much as
possible. Mrs. Ferrars can never forget that Edward is her (<font color='blue'><b>Ferrars</b></font>) son.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Mrs. Dashwood/John/Mrs. John Dashwood</b></font>)</div><p/>Elinor was silent.

<p/>Elinor, smiling at the grave and decisive importance of her (<font color='blue'><b>Elinor</b></font>) brother's
tone, calmly replied,

<p/>Elinor said no more, and John was also for a short time silent.--His (<font color='blue'><b>brother</b></font>)
reflections ended thus.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Of ONE thing, my dear sister,''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>kindly taking her (<font color='blue'><b>Elinor</b></font>) hand, and speaking in
an awful whisper,--``I may assure you;--and I WILL do it, because I know
it must gratify you. I have good reason to think--indeed I have it
from the best authority, or I should not repeat it, for otherwise it
would be very wrong to say any thing about it--but I have it from the
very best authority--not that I ever precisely heard Mrs. Ferrars say
it herself--but her (<font color='blue'><b>Ferrars</b></font>) daughter DID, and I have it from her (<font color='blue'><b>Ferrars</b></font>)--That in
short, whatever objections there might be against a certain--a certain
connection--you understand me--it would have been far preferable to
her (<font color='blue'><b>Ferrars</b></font>), it would not have given her (<font color='blue'><b>Ferrars</b></font>) half the vexation that THIS does. I
was exceedingly pleased to hear that Mrs. Ferrars considered it in that
light--a very gratifying circumstance you know to us all. ``It would
have been beyond comparison,<div class="bookquote">'' she (<font color='blue'><b>Elinor</b></font>) said, `the least evil of the two, and
she (<font color='blue'><b>Elinor</b></font>) would be glad to compound NOW for nothing worse.''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>But however, all
that is quite out of the question--not to be thought of or
mentioned--as to any attachment you know--it never could be--all that
is gone by. But I thought I would just tell you of this, because I
knew how much it must please you. Not that you have any reason to
regret, my dear Elinor. There is no doubt of your doing exceedingly
well--quite as well, or better, perhaps, all things considered. Has
Colonel Brandon been with you lately?''

<p/>Elinor had heard enough, if not to gratify her (<font color='blue'><b>Elinor</b></font>) vanity, and raise her (<font color='blue'><b>Elinor</b></font>)
self-importance, to agitate her (<font color='blue'><b>Elinor</b></font>) nerves and fill her (<font color='blue'><b>Elinor</b></font>) mind;--and she (<font color='blue'><b>Elinor</b></font>) was
therefore glad to be spared from the necessity of saying much in reply
herself, and from the danger of hearing any thing more from her (<font color='blue'><b>Elinor</b></font>)
brother, by the entrance of Mr. Robert Ferrars. After a few moments'
chat, John Dashwood, recollecting that Fanny was yet uninformed of her (<font color='blue'><b>Fanny</b></font>)
sister's being there, quitted the room in quest of her (<font color='blue'><b>Fanny</b></font>); and Elinor was
left to improve her (<font color='blue'><b>Elinor</b></font>) acquaintance with Robert, who, by the gay
unconcern, the happy self-complacency of his (<font color='blue'><b>Robert</b></font>) manner while enjoying so
unfair a division of his (<font color='blue'><b>Robert</b></font>) mother's love and liberality, to the prejudice
of his (<font color='blue'><b>Robert</b></font>) banished brother, earned only by his (<font color='blue'><b>Robert</b></font>) own dissipated course of
life, and that brother's integrity, was confirming her (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) most
unfavourable opinion of his (<font color='blue'><b>Robert</b></font>) head and heart.

<p/>They had scarcely been two minutes by themselves, before he (<font color='blue'><b>Robert</b></font>) began to
speak of Edward; for he (<font color='blue'><b>Robert</b></font>), too, had heard of the living, and was very
inquisitive on the subject. Elinor repeated the particulars of it, as
she (<font color='blue'><b>Elinor</b></font>) had given them to John; and their effect on Robert, though very
different, was not less striking than it had been on HIM. He (<font color='blue'><b>Robert</b></font>) laughed
most immoderately. The idea of Edward's being a clergyman, and living
in a small parsonage-house, diverted him (<font color='blue'><b>Edward</b></font>) beyond measure;--and when to
that was added the fanciful imagery of Edward reading prayers in a
white surplice, and publishing the banns of marriage between John Smith
and Mary Brown, he (<font color='blue'><b>Smith</b></font>) could conceive nothing more ridiculous.

<p/>Elinor, while she (<font color='blue'><b>Elinor</b></font>) waited in silence and immovable gravity, the
conclusion of such folly, could not restrain her (<font color='blue'><b>Elinor</b></font>) eyes from being fixed
on him (<font color='blue'><b>Smith</b></font>) with a look that spoke all the contempt it excited. It was a
look, however, very well bestowed, for it relieved her (<font color='blue'><b>Elinor</b></font>) own feelings,
and gave no intelligence to him (<font color='blue'><b>Smith</b></font>). He (<font color='blue'><b>Smith</b></font>) was recalled from wit to wisdom,
not by any reproof of hers, but by his (<font color='blue'><b>Smith</b></font>) own sensibility.

<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Smith</b></font>) had just settled this point with great composure, when the entrance
of Mrs. John Dashwood put an end to the subject. But though SHE never
spoke of it out of her (<font color='blue'><b>Dashwood</b></font>) own family, Elinor could see its influence on
her (<font color='blue'><b>Elinor</b></font>) mind, in the something like confusion of countenance with which she (<font color='blue'><b>Elinor</b></font>)
entered, and an attempt at cordiality in her (<font color='blue'><b>Elinor</b></font>) behaviour to herself. She (<font color='blue'><b>Elinor</b></font>)
even proceeded so far as to be concerned to find that Elinor and her (<font color='blue'><b>Elinor</b></font>)
sister were so soon to leave town, as she (<font color='blue'><b>Elinor</b></font>) had hoped to see more of
them;--an exertion in which her (<font color='blue'><b>Elinor</b></font>) husband, who attended her (<font color='blue'><b>Elinor</b></font>) into the
room, and hung enamoured over her (<font color='blue'><b>Elinor</b></font>) accents, seemed to distinguish every
thing that was most affectionate and graceful.

<p/>One other short call in Harley Street, in which Elinor received her (<font color='blue'><b>Elinor</b></font>)
brother's congratulations on their travelling so far towards Barton
without any expense, and on Colonel Brandon's being to follow them to
Cleveland in a day or two, completed the intercourse of the brother and
sisters in town;--and a faint invitation from Fanny, to come to Norland
whenever it should happen to be in their way, which of all things was
the most unlikely to occur, with a more warm, though less public,
assurance, from John to Elinor, of the promptitude with which he (<font color='blue'><b>brother</b></font>) should
come to see her (<font color='blue'><b>Elinor</b></font>) at Delaford, was all that foretold any meeting in the
country.

<p/>Elinor's satisfaction, at the moment of removal, was more positive.
She (<font color='blue'><b>Elinor</b></font>) had no such object for her (<font color='blue'><b>Elinor</b></font>) lingering thoughts to fix on, she (<font color='blue'><b>Elinor</b></font>) left
no creature behind, from whom it would give her (<font color='blue'><b>Elinor</b></font>) a moment's regret to be
divided for ever, she (<font color='blue'><b>Elinor</b></font>) was pleased to be free herself from the
persecution of Lucy's friendship, she (<font color='blue'><b>Lucy</b></font>) was grateful for bringing her (<font color='blue'><b>Lucy</b></font>)
sister away unseen by Willoughby since his (<font color='blue'><b>Willoughby</b></font>) marriage, and she (<font color='blue'><b>Lucy</b></font>) looked
forward with hope to what a few months of tranquility at Barton might
do towards restoring Marianne's peace of mind, and confirming her (<font color='blue'><b>Marianne</b></font>) own.

<p/>Their party was small, and the hours passed quietly away. Mrs. Palmer
had her (<font color='blue'><b>Palmer</b></font>) child, and Mrs. Jennings her (<font color='blue'><b>Palmer</b></font>) carpet-work; they talked of the
friends they had left behind, arranged Lady Middleton's engagements,
and wondered whether Mr. Palmer and Colonel Brandon would get farther
than Reading that night. Elinor, however little concerned in it,
joined in their discourse; and Marianne, who had the knack of finding
her (<font color='blue'><b>Marianne</b></font>) way in every house to the library, however it might be avoided by
the family in general, soon procured herself a book.

<p/>Nothing was wanting on Mrs. Palmer's side that constant and friendly
good humour could do, to make them feel themselves welcome. The
openness and heartiness of her (<font color='blue'><b>Palmer</b></font>) manner more than atoned for that want of
recollection and elegance which made her (<font color='blue'><b>Palmer</b></font>) often deficient in the forms
of politeness; her (<font color='blue'><b>Palmer</b></font>) kindness, recommended by so pretty a face, was
engaging; her (<font color='blue'><b>Palmer</b></font>) folly, though evident was not disgusting, because it was
not conceited; and Elinor could have forgiven every thing but her (<font color='blue'><b>Elinor</b></font>) laugh.

<p/>Elinor had seen so little of Mr. Palmer, and in that little had seen so
much variety in his (<font color='blue'><b>Palmer</b></font>) address to her (<font color='blue'><b>Elinor</b></font>) sister and herself, that she (<font color='blue'><b>Elinor</b></font>) knew
not what to expect to find him (<font color='blue'><b>Palmer</b></font>) in his (<font color='blue'><b>Palmer</b></font>) own family. She (<font color='blue'><b>Elinor</b></font>) found him (<font color='blue'><b>Palmer</b></font>),
however, perfectly the gentleman in his (<font color='blue'><b>Palmer</b></font>) behaviour to all his (<font color='blue'><b>Palmer</b></font>) visitors,
and only occasionally rude to his (<font color='blue'><b>Palmer</b></font>) wife and her (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>) mother; she (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>) found him (<font color='blue'><b>Palmer</b></font>)
very capable of being a pleasant companion, and only prevented from
being so always, by too great an aptitude to fancy himself as much
superior to people in general, as he (<font color='blue'><b>Palmer</b></font>) must feel himself to be to Mrs.
Jennings and Charlotte. For the rest of his (<font color='blue'><b>Palmer</b></font>) character and habits, they
were marked, as far as Elinor could perceive, with no traits at all
unusual in his (<font color='blue'><b>Palmer</b></font>) sex and time of life. He (<font color='blue'><b>Palmer</b></font>) was nice in his (<font color='blue'><b>Palmer</b></font>) eating,
uncertain in his (<font color='blue'><b>Palmer</b></font>) hours; fond of his (<font color='blue'><b>Palmer</b></font>) child, though affecting to slight
it; and idled away the mornings at billiards, which ought to have been
devoted to business. She (<font color='blue'><b>Elinor</b></font>) liked him (<font color='blue'><b>Palmer</b></font>), however, upon the whole, much
better than she (<font color='blue'><b>Elinor</b></font>) had expected, and in her (<font color='blue'><b>Elinor</b></font>) heart was not sorry that she (<font color='blue'><b>Elinor</b></font>)
could like him (<font color='blue'><b>Palmer</b></font>) no more;--not sorry to be driven by the observation of
his (<font color='blue'><b>Palmer</b></font>) Epicurism, his (<font color='blue'><b>Palmer</b></font>) selfishness, and his (<font color='blue'><b>Palmer</b></font>) conceit, to rest with
complacency on the remembrance of Edward's generous temper, simple
taste, and diffident feelings.

<p/>Of Edward, or at least of some of his (<font color='blue'><b>Edward</b></font>) concerns, she (<font color='blue'><b>Elinor</b></font>) now received
intelligence from Colonel Brandon, who had been into Dorsetshire
lately; and who, treating her (<font color='blue'><b>Elinor</b></font>) at once as the disinterested friend of
Mr. Ferrars, and the kind of confidant of himself, talked to her (<font color='blue'><b>Elinor</b></font>) a
great deal of the parsonage at Delaford, described its deficiencies,
and told her (<font color='blue'><b>Elinor</b></font>) what he (<font color='blue'><b>Ferrars</b></font>) meant to do himself towards removing them.--His (<font color='blue'><b>Ferrars</b></font>)
behaviour to her (<font color='blue'><b>Elinor</b></font>) in this, as well as in every other particular, his (<font color='blue'><b>Ferrars</b></font>)
open pleasure in meeting her (<font color='blue'><b>Elinor</b></font>) after an absence of only ten days, his (<font color='blue'><b>Ferrars</b></font>)
readiness to converse with her (<font color='blue'><b>Elinor</b></font>), and his (<font color='blue'><b>Ferrars</b></font>) deference for her (<font color='blue'><b>Elinor</b></font>) opinion,
might very well justify Mrs. Jennings's persuasion of his (<font color='blue'><b>Ferrars</b></font>) attachment,
and would have been enough, perhaps, had not Elinor still, as from the
first, believed Marianne his (<font color='blue'><b>Ferrars</b></font>) real favourite, to make her (<font color='blue'><b>Marianne</b></font>) suspect it
herself. But as it was, such a notion had scarcely ever entered her (<font color='blue'><b>Marianne</b></font>)
head, except by Mrs. Jennings's suggestion; and she (<font color='blue'><b>Marianne</b></font>) could not help
believing herself the nicest observer of the two;--she (<font color='blue'><b>Marianne</b></font>) watched his (<font color='blue'><b>Ferrars</b></font>)
eyes, while Mrs. Jennings thought only of his (<font color='blue'><b>Ferrars</b></font>) behaviour;--and while his (<font color='blue'><b>Ferrars</b></font>)
looks of anxious solicitude on Marianne's feeling, in her (<font color='blue'><b>Marianne</b></font>) head and
throat, the beginning of a heavy cold, because unexpressed by words,
entirely escaped the latter lady's observation;--SHE could discover in
them the quick feelings, and needless alarm of a lover.

<p/>Two delightful twilight walks on the third and fourth evenings of her (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>)
being there, not merely on the dry gravel of the shrubbery, but all
over the grounds, and especially in the most distant parts of them,
where there was something more of wildness than in the rest, where the
trees were the oldest, and the grass was the longest and wettest,
had--assisted by the still greater imprudence of sitting in her (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) wet
shoes and stockings--given Marianne a cold so violent as, though for a
day or two trifled with or denied, would force itself by increasing
ailments on the concern of every body, and the notice of herself.
Prescriptions poured in from all quarters, and as usual, were all
declined. Though heavy and feverish, with a pain in her (<font color='blue'><b>Marianne</b></font>) limbs, and a
cough, and a sore throat, a good night's rest was to cure her (<font color='blue'><b>Marianne</b></font>) entirely;
and it was with difficulty that Elinor prevailed on her (<font color='blue'><b>Elinor</b></font>), when she (<font color='blue'><b>Elinor</b></font>) went
to bed, to try one or two of the simplest of the remedies.

<p/>A very restless and feverish night, however, disappointed the
expectation of both; and when Marianne, after persisting in rising,
confessed herself unable to sit up, and returned voluntarily to her (<font color='blue'><b>Marianne</b></font>)
bed, Elinor was very ready to adopt Mrs. Jennings's advice, of sending
for the Palmers' apothecary.

<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Marianne</b></font>) came, examined his (<font color='blue'><b>Marianne</b></font>) patient, and though encouraging Miss Dashwood to
expect that a very few days would restore her (<font color='blue'><b>Dashwood</b></font>) sister to health, yet, by
pronouncing her (<font color='blue'><b>Dashwood</b></font>) disorder to have a putrid tendency, and allowing the
word <div class="bookquote">``infection''  (<font color='red'><b>sister</b></font>)</div>to pass his (<font color='blue'><b>Marianne</b></font>) lips, gave instant alarm to Mrs. Palmer,
on her (<font color='blue'><b>Palmer</b></font>) baby's account. Mrs. Jennings, who had been inclined from the
first to think Marianne's complaint more serious than Elinor, now
looked very grave on Mr. Harris's report, and confirming Charlotte's
fears and caution, urged the necessity of her (<font color='blue'><b>Charlotte</b></font>) immediate removal with
her (<font color='blue'><b>Charlotte</b></font>) infant; and Mr. Palmer, though treating their apprehensions as
idle, found the anxiety and importunity of his (<font color='blue'><b>Palmer</b></font>) wife too great to be
withstood. Her (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>) departure, therefore, was fixed on; and within an hour
after Mr. Harris's arrival, she (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>) set off, with her (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>) little boy and his (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>)
nurse, for the house of a near relation of Mr. Palmer's, who lived a
few miles on the other side of Bath; whither her (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>) husband promised, at
her (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>) earnest entreaty, to join her (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>) in a day or two; and whither she (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>) was
almost equally urgent with her (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>) mother to accompany her (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>). Mrs. Jennings,
however, with a kindness of heart which made Elinor really love her (<font color='blue'><b>Elinor</b></font>),
declared her (<font color='blue'><b>Elinor</b></font>) resolution of not stirring from Cleveland as long as
Marianne remained ill, and of endeavouring, by her (<font color='blue'><b>Marianne</b></font>) own attentive care,
to supply to her (<font color='blue'><b>Marianne</b></font>) the place of the mother she (<font color='blue'><b>Marianne</b></font>) had taken her (<font color='blue'><b>Marianne</b></font>) from; and
Elinor found her (<font color='blue'><b>Elinor</b></font>) on every occasion a most willing and active helpmate,
desirous to share in all her (<font color='blue'><b>Elinor</b></font>) fatigues, and often by her (<font color='blue'><b>Elinor</b></font>) better
experience in nursing, of material use.

<p/>Poor Marianne, languid and low from the nature of her (<font color='blue'><b>Marianne</b></font>) malady, and
feeling herself universally ill, could no longer hope that tomorrow
would find her (<font color='blue'><b>Marianne</b></font>) recovered; and the idea of what tomorrow would have
produced, but for this unlucky illness, made every ailment severe; for
on that day they were to have begun their journey home; and, attended
the whole way by a servant of Mrs. Jennings, were to have taken their
mother by surprise on the following forenoon. The little she (<font color='blue'><b>Jennings</b></font>) said was
all in lamentation of this inevitable delay; though Elinor tried to
raise her (<font color='blue'><b>Elinor</b></font>) spirits, and make her (<font color='blue'><b>Elinor</b></font>) believe, as she (<font color='blue'><b>Elinor</b></font>) THEN really believed
herself, that it would be a very short one.

<p/>On the morning of the third day however, the gloomy anticipations of
both were almost done away; for when Mr. Harris arrived, he (<font color='blue'><b>Harris</b></font>) declared
his (<font color='blue'><b>Harris</b></font>) patient materially better. Her (<font color='blue'><b>Elinor</b></font>) pulse was much stronger, and every
symptom more favourable than on the preceding visit. Elinor, confirmed
in every pleasant hope, was all cheerfulness; rejoicing that in her (<font color='blue'><b>Elinor</b></font>)
letters to her (<font color='blue'><b>Elinor</b></font>) mother, she (<font color='blue'><b>Elinor</b></font>) had pursued her (<font color='blue'><b>Elinor</b></font>) own judgment rather than her (<font color='blue'><b>Elinor</b></font>)
friend's, in making very light of the indisposition which delayed them
at Cleveland; and almost fixing on the time when Marianne would be able
to travel.

<p/>But the day did not close so auspiciously as it began.-- Towards the
evening Marianne became ill again, growing more heavy, restless, and
uncomfortable than before. Her (<font color='blue'><b>Marianne</b></font>) sister, however, still sanguine, was
willing to attribute the change to nothing more than the fatigue of
having sat up to have her (<font color='blue'><b>Marianne</b></font>) bed made; and carefully administering the
cordials prescribed, saw her (<font color='blue'><b>Marianne</b></font>), with satisfaction, sink at last into a
slumber, from which she (<font color='blue'><b>Marianne</b></font>) expected the most beneficial effects. Her (<font color='blue'><b>Marianne</b></font>)
sleep, though not so quiet as Elinor wished to see it, lasted a
considerable time; and anxious to observe the result of it herself, she (<font color='blue'><b>Elinor</b></font>)
resolved to sit with her (<font color='blue'><b>Elinor</b></font>) during the whole of it. Mrs. Jennings,
knowing nothing of any change in the patient, went unusually early to
bed; her (<font color='blue'><b>Jennings</b></font>) maid, who was one of the principal nurses, was recreating
herself in the housekeeper's room, and Elinor remained alone with
Marianne.

<p/>Elinor perceived with alarm that she (<font color='blue'><b>Elinor</b></font>) was not quite herself, and, while
attempting to soothe her (<font color='blue'><b>Elinor</b></font>), eagerly felt her (<font color='blue'><b>Elinor</b></font>) pulse. It was lower and
quicker than ever! and Marianne, still talking wildly of mama, her (<font color='blue'><b>Marianne</b></font>)
alarm increased so rapidly, as to determine her (<font color='blue'><b>Marianne</b></font>) on sending instantly
for Mr. Harris, and despatching a messenger to Barton for her (<font color='blue'><b>Marianne</b></font>) mother.
To consult with Colonel Brandon on the best means of effecting the
latter, was a thought which immediately followed the resolution of its
performance; and as soon she (<font color='blue'><b>Marianne</b></font>) had rung up the maid to take her (<font color='blue'><b>Marianne</b></font>) place by
her (<font color='blue'><b>Marianne</b></font>) sister, she (<font color='blue'><b>Marianne</b></font>) hastened down to the drawing-room, where she (<font color='blue'><b>Marianne</b></font>) knew he (<font color='blue'><b>Brandon</b></font>)
was generally to be found at a much later hour than the present.

<p/>It was no time for hesitation. Her (<font color='blue'><b>Marianne</b></font>) fears and her (<font color='blue'><b>Marianne</b></font>) difficulties were
immediately before him (<font color='blue'><b>Brandon</b></font>). Her (<font color='blue'><b>Marianne</b></font>) fears, he (<font color='blue'><b>Brandon</b></font>) had no courage, no confidence to
attempt the removal of:--he (<font color='blue'><b>Brandon</b></font>) listened to them in silent despondence;--but
her (<font color='blue'><b>Marianne</b></font>) difficulties were instantly obviated, for with a readiness that
seemed to speak the occasion, and the service pre-arranged in his (<font color='blue'><b>Brandon</b></font>) mind,
he (<font color='blue'><b>Brandon</b></font>) offered himself as the messenger who should fetch Mrs. Dashwood.
Elinor made no resistance that was not easily overcome. She (<font color='blue'><b>Elinor</b></font>) thanked him (<font color='blue'><b>Brandon</b></font>)
with brief, though fervent gratitude, and while he (<font color='blue'><b>Brandon</b></font>) went to hurry off his (<font color='blue'><b>Brandon</b></font>)
servant with a message to Mr. Harris, and an order for post-horses
directly, she (<font color='blue'><b>Elinor</b></font>) wrote a few lines to her (<font color='blue'><b>Elinor</b></font>) mother.

<p/>HE (<font color='blue'><b>Harris</b></font>), meanwhile, whatever he (<font color='blue'><b>Harris</b></font>) might feel, acted with all the firmness of a
collected mind, made every necessary arrangement with the utmost
despatch, and calculated with exactness the time in which she (<font color='blue'><b>Elinor</b></font>) might
look for his (<font color='blue'><b>Harris</b></font>) return. Not a moment was lost in delay of any kind. The
horses arrived, even before they were expected, and Colonel Brandon
only pressing her (<font color='blue'><b>Elinor</b></font>) hand with a look of solemnity, and a few words spoken
too low to reach her (<font color='blue'><b>Elinor</b></font>) ear, hurried into the carriage. It was then about
twelve o'clock, and she (<font color='blue'><b>Elinor</b></font>) returned to her (<font color='blue'><b>Elinor</b></font>) sister's apartment to wait for
the arrival of the apothecary, and to watch by her (<font color='blue'><b>Elinor</b></font>) the rest of the
night. It was a night of almost equal suffering to both. Hour after
hour passed away in sleepless pain and delirium on Marianne's side, and
in the most cruel anxiety on Elinor's, before Mr. Harris appeared. Her (<font color='blue'><b>Elinor</b></font>)
apprehensions once raised, paid by their excess for all her (<font color='blue'><b>Elinor</b></font>) former
security; and the servant who sat up with her (<font color='blue'><b>Elinor</b></font>), for she (<font color='blue'><b>Elinor</b></font>) would not allow
Mrs. Jennings to be called, only tortured her (<font color='blue'><b>Jennings</b></font>) more, by hints of what
her (<font color='blue'><b>Jennings</b></font>) mistress had always thought.

<p/>Marianne's ideas were still, at intervals, fixed incoherently on her (<font color='blue'><b>Marianne</b></font>)
mother, and whenever she (<font color='blue'><b>Marianne</b></font>) mentioned her (<font color='blue'><b>Marianne</b></font>) name, it gave a pang to the
heart of poor Elinor, who, reproaching herself for having trifled with
so many days of illness, and wretched for some immediate relief,
fancied that all relief might soon be in vain, that every thing had
been delayed too long, and pictured to herself her (<font color='blue'><b>Elinor</b></font>) suffering mother
arriving too late to see this darling child, or to see her (<font color='blue'><b>Elinor</b></font>) rational.

<p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>Elinor</b></font>) was on the point of sending again for Mr. Harris, or if HE (<font color='blue'><b>Harris</b></font>) could
not come, for some other advice, when the former--but not till after
five o'clock--arrived. His (<font color='blue'><b>Harris</b></font>) opinion, however, made some little amends
for his (<font color='blue'><b>Harris</b></font>) delay, for though acknowledging a very unexpected and
unpleasant alteration in his (<font color='blue'><b>Harris</b></font>) patient, he (<font color='blue'><b>Harris</b></font>) would not allow the danger to
be material, and talked of the relief which a fresh mode of treatment
must procure, with a confidence which, in a lesser degree, was
communicated to Elinor. He (<font color='blue'><b>Harris</b></font>) promised to call again in the course of
three or four hours, and left both the patient and her (<font color='blue'><b>Elinor</b></font>) anxious
attendant more composed than he (<font color='blue'><b>attendant</b></font>) had found them.

<p/>With strong concern, and with many reproaches for not being called to
their aid, did Mrs. Jennings hear in the morning of what had passed.
Her (<font color='blue'><b>Jennings</b></font>) former apprehensions, now with greater reason restored, left her (<font color='blue'><b>Jennings</b></font>) no
doubt of the event; and though trying to speak comfort to Elinor, her (<font color='blue'><b>Elinor</b></font>)
conviction of her (<font color='blue'><b>Elinor</b></font>) sister's danger would not allow her (<font color='blue'><b>Elinor</b></font>) to offer the
comfort of hope. Her (<font color='blue'><b>Elinor</b></font>) heart was really grieved. The rapid decay, the
early death of a girl so young, so lovely as Marianne, must have struck
a less interested person with concern. On Mrs. Jennings's compassion
she (<font color='blue'><b>Jennings</b></font>) had other claims. She (<font color='blue'><b>Jennings</b></font>) had been for three months her (<font color='blue'><b>Jennings</b></font>) companion, was
still under her (<font color='blue'><b>Jennings</b></font>) care, and she (<font color='blue'><b>Jennings</b></font>) was known to have been greatly injured,
and long unhappy. The distress of her (<font color='blue'><b>Jennings</b></font>) sister too, particularly a
favourite, was before her (<font color='blue'><b>Jennings</b></font>);--and as for their mother, when Mrs. Jennings
considered that Marianne might probably be to HER what Charlotte was to
herself, her (<font color='blue'><b>Charlotte</b></font>) sympathy in HER sufferings was very sincere.

<p/>Mr. Harris was punctual in his (<font color='blue'><b>Harris</b></font>) second visit;--but he (<font color='blue'><b>Harris</b></font>) came to be
disappointed in his (<font color='blue'><b>Harris</b></font>) hopes of what the last would produce. His (<font color='blue'><b>Harris</b></font>)
medicines had failed;--the fever was unabated; and Marianne only more
quiet--not more herself--remained in a heavy stupor. Elinor, catching
all, and more than all, his (<font color='blue'><b>Harris</b></font>) fears in a moment, proposed to call in
further advice. But he (<font color='blue'><b>Harris</b></font>) judged it unnecessary: he (<font color='blue'><b>Harris</b></font>) had still something
more to try, some more fresh application, of whose success he (<font color='blue'><b>Harris</b></font>) was as
confident as the last, and his (<font color='blue'><b>Harris</b></font>) visit concluded with encouraging
assurances which reached the ear, but could not enter the heart of Miss
Dashwood. She (<font color='blue'><b>Dashwood</b></font>) was calm, except when she (<font color='blue'><b>Dashwood</b></font>) thought of her (<font color='blue'><b>Dashwood</b></font>) mother; but she (<font color='blue'><b>Dashwood</b></font>)
was almost hopeless; and in this state she (<font color='blue'><b>Dashwood</b></font>) continued till noon,
scarcely stirring from her (<font color='blue'><b>Dashwood</b></font>) sister's bed, her (<font color='blue'><b>Dashwood</b></font>) thoughts wandering from
one image of grief, one suffering friend to another, and her (<font color='blue'><b>Dashwood</b></font>) spirits
oppressed to the utmost by the conversation of Mrs. Jennings, who
scrupled not to attribute the severity and danger of this attack to the
many weeks of previous indisposition which Marianne's disappointment
had brought on. Elinor felt all the reasonableness of the idea, and it
gave fresh misery to her (<font color='blue'><b>Elinor</b></font>) reflections.

<p/>About noon, however, she (<font color='blue'><b>Elinor</b></font>) began--but with a caution--a dread of
disappointment which for some time kept her (<font color='blue'><b>Elinor</b></font>) silent, even to her (<font color='blue'><b>Elinor</b></font>)
friend--to fancy, to hope she (<font color='blue'><b>Elinor</b></font>) could perceive a slight amendment in her (<font color='blue'><b>Elinor</b></font>)
sister's pulse;--she (<font color='blue'><b>Elinor</b></font>) waited, watched, and examined it again and
again;--and at last, with an agitation more difficult to bury under
exterior calmness, than all her (<font color='blue'><b>Elinor</b></font>) foregoing distress, ventured to
communicate her (<font color='blue'><b>Elinor</b></font>) hopes. Mrs. Jennings, though forced, on examination,
to acknowledge a temporary revival, tried to keep her (<font color='blue'><b>Jennings</b></font>) young friend from
indulging a thought of its continuance;--and Elinor, conning over every
injunction of distrust, told herself likewise not to hope. But it was
too late. Hope had already entered; and feeling all its anxious
flutter, she (<font color='blue'><b>Elinor</b></font>) bent over her (<font color='blue'><b>Elinor</b></font>) sister to watch--she (<font color='blue'><b>Elinor</b></font>) hardly knew for what.
Half an hour passed away, and the favourable symptom yet blessed her (<font color='blue'><b>Elinor</b></font>).
Others even arose to confirm it. Her (<font color='blue'><b>Elinor</b></font>) breath, her (<font color='blue'><b>Elinor</b></font>) skin, her (<font color='blue'><b>Elinor</b></font>) lips, all
flattered Elinor with signs of amendment; and Marianne fixed her (<font color='blue'><b>Marianne</b></font>) eyes
on her (<font color='blue'><b>Marianne</b></font>) with a rational, though languid, gaze. Anxiety and hope now
oppressed her (<font color='blue'><b>Marianne</b></font>) in equal degrees, and left her (<font color='blue'><b>Marianne</b></font>) no moment of tranquillity
till the arrival of Mr. Harris at four o'clock;--when his (<font color='blue'><b>Harris</b></font>) assurances,
his (<font color='blue'><b>Harris</b></font>) felicitations on a recovery in her (<font color='blue'><b>Marianne</b></font>) sister even surpassing his (<font color='blue'><b>Harris</b></font>)
expectation, gave her (<font color='blue'><b>Marianne</b></font>) confidence, comfort, and tears of joy.

<p/>Elinor could not be cheerful. Her (<font color='blue'><b>Elinor</b></font>) joy was of a different kind, and led
to any thing rather than to gaiety. Marianne restored to life, health,
friends, and to her (<font color='blue'><b>Marianne</b></font>) doting mother, was an idea to fill her (<font color='blue'><b>Marianne</b></font>) heart with
sensations of exquisite comfort, and expand it in fervent
gratitude;--but it led to no outward demonstrations of joy, no words,
no smiles. All within Elinor's breast was satisfaction, silent and
strong.

<p/>At seven o'clock, leaving Marianne still sweetly asleep, she (<font color='blue'><b>Marianne</b></font>) joined
Mrs. Jennings in the drawing-room to tea. Of breakfast she (<font color='blue'><b>Marianne</b></font>) had been
kept by her (<font color='blue'><b>Marianne</b></font>) fears, and of dinner by their sudden reverse, from eating
much;--and the present refreshment, therefore, with such feelings of
content as she (<font color='blue'><b>Marianne</b></font>) brought to it, was particularly welcome. Mrs. Jennings
would have persuaded her (<font color='blue'><b>Jennings</b></font>), at its conclusion, to take some rest before
her (<font color='blue'><b>Jennings</b></font>) mother's arrival, and allow HER to take her (<font color='blue'><b>Jennings</b></font>) place by Marianne; but
Elinor had no sense of fatigue, no capability of sleep at that moment
about her (<font color='blue'><b>Elinor</b></font>), and she (<font color='blue'><b>Elinor</b></font>) was not to be kept away from her (<font color='blue'><b>Elinor</b></font>) sister an
unnecessary instant. Mrs. Jennings therefore attending her (<font color='blue'><b>Jennings</b></font>) up stairs
into the sick chamber, to satisfy herself that all continued right,
left her (<font color='blue'><b>Jennings</b></font>) there again to her (<font color='blue'><b>Jennings</b></font>) charge and her (<font color='blue'><b>Jennings</b></font>) thoughts, and retired to her (<font color='blue'><b>Jennings</b></font>)
own room to write letters and sleep.

<p/>The night was cold and stormy. The wind roared round the house, and
the rain beat against the windows; but Elinor, all happiness within,
regarded it not. Marianne slept through every blast; and the
travellers--they had a rich reward in store, for every present
inconvenience.

<p/>The clock struck eight. Had it been ten, Elinor would have been
convinced that at that moment she (<font color='blue'><b>Elinor</b></font>) heard a carriage driving up to the
house; and so strong was the persuasion that she (<font color='blue'><b>Elinor</b></font>) DID, in spite of the
ALMOST impossibility of their being already come, that she (<font color='blue'><b>Elinor</b></font>) moved into
the adjoining dressing-closet and opened a window shutter, to be
satisfied of the truth. She (<font color='blue'><b>Elinor</b></font>) instantly saw that her (<font color='blue'><b>Elinor</b></font>) ears had not
deceived her (<font color='blue'><b>Elinor</b></font>). The flaring lamps of a carriage were immediately in
view. By their uncertain light she (<font color='blue'><b>Elinor</b></font>) thought she (<font color='blue'><b>Elinor</b></font>) could discern it to be
drawn by four horses; and this, while it told the excess of her (<font color='blue'><b>Elinor</b></font>) poor
mother's alarm, gave some explanation to such unexpected rapidity.

<p/>Never in her (<font color='blue'><b>Elinor</b></font>) life had Elinor found it so difficult to be calm, as at
that moment. The knowledge of what her (<font color='blue'><b>Elinor</b></font>) mother must be feeling as the
carriage stopt at the door--of her (<font color='blue'><b>Elinor</b></font>) doubt--her (<font color='blue'><b>Elinor</b></font>) dread--perhaps her (<font color='blue'><b>Elinor</b></font>)
despair!--and of what SHE had to tell!--with such knowledge it was
impossible to be calm. All that remained to be done was to be speedy;
and, therefore staying only till she (<font color='blue'><b>Elinor</b></font>) could leave Mrs. Jennings's maid
with her (<font color='blue'><b>Jennings</b></font>) sister, she (<font color='blue'><b>Jennings</b></font>) hurried down stairs.

<p/>Elinor, starting back with a look of horror at the sight of him (<font color='blue'><b>Elinor</b></font>), obeyed
the first impulse of her (<font color='blue'><b>Elinor</b></font>) heart in turning instantly to quit the room,
and her (<font color='blue'><b>Elinor</b></font>) hand was already on the lock, when its action was suspended by
his (<font color='blue'><b>Elinor</b></font>) hastily advancing, and saying, in a voice rather of command than
supplication,

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Pray be quick, sir,'' (<font color='red'><b>him</b></font>)</div>--said Elinor, impatiently;--<div class="bookquote">``I have no time to
spare.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Elinor/-- Elinor/ELINOR</b></font>)</div><p/>Elinor would not speak. He (<font color='blue'><b>Elinor</b></font>) repeated the inquiry with yet greater
eagerness.

<p/>Elinor looked at him (<font color='blue'><b>Elinor</b></font>) with greater astonishment than ever. She (<font color='blue'><b>Elinor</b></font>) began to
think that he (<font color='blue'><b>Elinor</b></font>) must be in liquor;--the strangeness of such a visit, and
of such manners, seemed no otherwise intelligible; and with this
impression she (<font color='blue'><b>Elinor</b></font>) immediately rose, saying,

<p/><div class="bookquote">``At Marlborough!'' (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>--cried Elinor, more and more at a loss to understand
what he (<font color='blue'><b>Elinor</b></font>) would be at.

<p/>The steadiness of his (<font color='blue'><b>Elinor</b></font>) manner, and the intelligence of his (<font color='blue'><b>Elinor</b></font>) eye as he (<font color='blue'><b>Elinor</b></font>)
spoke, convincing Elinor, that whatever other unpardonable folly might
bring him (<font color='blue'><b>Elinor</b></font>) to Cleveland, he (<font color='blue'><b>Elinor</b></font>) was not brought there by intoxication, she (<font color='blue'><b>Elinor</b></font>)
said, after a moment's recollection,

<p/>Elinor bowed her (<font color='blue'><b>Elinor</b></font>) assent.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``You did then,''  (<font color='red'><b>Elinor/-- Elinor/ELINOR</b></font>)</div>said Elinor, a little softened, <div class="bookquote">``believe yourself at
one time attached to her (<font color='blue'><b>Ferrars</b></font>)?''

 (<font color='red'><b>Elinor/-- Elinor/ELINOR</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I have,''  (<font color='red'><b>Elinor/-- Elinor/ELINOR</b></font>)</div>returned Elinor, colouring likewise, and hardening her (<font color='blue'><b>Elinor</b></font>) heart
anew against any compassion for him (<font color='blue'><b>Elinor</b></font>), <div class="bookquote">``I have heard it all. And how you
will explain away any part of your guilt in that dreadful business, I
confess is beyond my comprehension.''

 (<font color='red'><b>him</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Why did you call, Mr. Willoughby?''  (<font color='red'><b>Elinor/-- Elinor/ELINOR</b></font>)</div>said Elinor, reproachfully; <div class="bookquote">``a note
would have answered every purpose.-- Why was it necessary to call?''

 (<font color='red'><b>Elinor/-- Elinor/ELINOR</b></font>)</div><p/>They were both silent for a few moments. Elinor first spoke.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Well, sir,''  (<font color='red'><b>Elinor/-- Elinor/ELINOR</b></font>)</div>said Elinor, who, though pitying him (<font color='blue'><b>Elinor</b></font>), grew impatient for
his (<font color='blue'><b>Elinor</b></font>) departure, <div class="bookquote">``and this is all?''

 (<font color='red'><b>him</b></font>)</div><p/>Elinor's heart, which had undergone many changes in the course of this
extraordinary conversation, was now softened again;--yet she (<font color='blue'><b>Elinor</b></font>) felt it
her (<font color='blue'><b>Elinor</b></font>) duty to check such ideas in her (<font color='blue'><b>Elinor</b></font>) companion as the last.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``You are very wrong, Mr. Willoughby, very blamable,''  (<font color='red'><b>Elinor/-- Elinor/ELINOR</b></font>)</div>said Elinor, while
her (<font color='blue'><b>Elinor</b></font>) voice, in spite of herself, betrayed her (<font color='blue'><b>Elinor</b></font>) compassionate emotion;
<div class="bookquote">``you ought not to speak in this way, either of Mrs. Willoughby or my
sister. You had made your own choice. It was not forced on you. Your
wife has a claim to your politeness, to your respect, at least. She (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>)
must be attached to you, or she (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>) would not have married you. To treat
her (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>) with unkindness, to speak of her (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>) slightingly is no atonement to
Marianne--nor can I suppose it a relief to your own conscience.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Elinor/-- Elinor/ELINOR</b></font>)</div><p/>Elinor made no answer. Her (<font color='blue'><b>Elinor</b></font>) thoughts were silently fixed on the
irreparable injury which too early an independence and its consequent
habits of idleness, dissipation, and luxury, had made in the mind, the
character, the happiness, of a man who, to every advantage of person
and talents, united a disposition naturally open and honest, and a
feeling, affectionate temper. The world had made him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) extravagant and
vain--Extravagance and vanity had made him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) cold-hearted and selfish.
Vanity, while seeking its own guilty triumph at the expense of another,
had involved him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) in a real attachment, which extravagance, or at least
its offspring, necessity, had required to be sacrificed. Each faulty
propensity in leading him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) to evil, had led him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) likewise to punishment.
The attachment, from which against honour, against feeling, against
every better interest he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) had outwardly torn himself, now, when no
longer allowable, governed every thought; and the connection, for the
sake of which he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) had, with little scruple, left her (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) sister to misery,
was likely to prove a source of unhappiness to himself of a far more
incurable nature. From a reverie of this kind she (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) was recalled at the
end of some minutes by Willoughby, who, rousing himself from a reverie
at least equally painful, started up in preparation for going, and
said--

<p/>Elinor assured him (<font color='blue'><b>Willoughby</b></font>) that she (<font color='blue'><b>Elinor</b></font>) did;--that she (<font color='blue'><b>Elinor</b></font>) forgave, pitied, wished him (<font color='blue'><b>Willoughby</b></font>)
well--was even interested in his (<font color='blue'><b>Willoughby</b></font>) happiness--and added some gentle
counsel as to the behaviour most likely to promote it. His (<font color='blue'><b>Willoughby</b></font>) answer was
not very encouraging.

<p/>Elinor stopped him (<font color='blue'><b>Willoughby</b></font>) with a reproof.

<p/>Elinor, for some time after he (<font color='blue'><b>Willoughby</b></font>) left her (<font color='blue'><b>Elinor</b></font>), for some time even after the
sound of his (<font color='blue'><b>Willoughby</b></font>) carriage had died away, remained too much oppressed by a
crowd of ideas, widely differing in themselves, but of which sadness
was the general result, to think even of her (<font color='blue'><b>Elinor</b></font>) sister.

<p/>When at last she (<font color='blue'><b>Elinor</b></font>) returned to the unconscious Marianne, she (<font color='blue'><b>Marianne</b></font>) found her (<font color='blue'><b>Marianne</b></font>)
just awaking, refreshed by so long and sweet a sleep to the extent of
her (<font color='blue'><b>Marianne</b></font>) hopes. Elinor's heart was full. The past, the present, the
future, Willoughby's visit, Marianne's safety, and her (<font color='blue'><b>Marianne</b></font>) mother's
expected arrival, threw her (<font color='blue'><b>Marianne</b></font>) altogether into an agitation of spirits
which kept off every indication of fatigue, and made her (<font color='blue'><b>Marianne</b></font>) only fearful
of betraying herself to her (<font color='blue'><b>Marianne</b></font>) sister. Short was the time, however, in
which that fear could affect her (<font color='blue'><b>Marianne</b></font>), for within half an hour after
Willoughby's leaving the house, she (<font color='blue'><b>Marianne</b></font>) was again called down stairs by the
sound of another carriage.--Eager to save her (<font color='blue'><b>Marianne</b></font>) mother from every
unnecessary moment's horrible suspense, she (<font color='blue'><b>Marianne</b></font>) ran immediately into the
hall, and reached the outward door just in time to receive and support
her (<font color='blue'><b>Marianne</b></font>) as she (<font color='blue'><b>Marianne</b></font>) entered it.

<p/>Mrs. Dashwood, whose terror as they drew near the house had produced
almost the conviction of Marianne's being no more, had no voice to
inquire after her (<font color='blue'><b>Marianne</b></font>), no voice even for Elinor; but SHE, waiting neither
for salutation nor inquiry, instantly gave the joyful relief;--and her (<font color='blue'><b>Elinor</b></font>)
mother, catching it with all her (<font color='blue'><b>Elinor</b></font>) usual warmth, was in a moment as much
overcome by her (<font color='blue'><b>Elinor</b></font>) happiness, as she (<font color='blue'><b>Elinor</b></font>) had been before by her (<font color='blue'><b>Elinor</b></font>) fears. She (<font color='blue'><b>Elinor</b></font>)
was supported into the drawing-room between her (<font color='blue'><b>Elinor</b></font>) daughter and her (<font color='blue'><b>Elinor</b></font>)
friend;--and there, shedding tears of joy, though still unable to
speak, embraced Elinor again and again, turning from her (<font color='blue'><b>Elinor</b></font>) at intervals
to press Colonel Brandon's hand, with a look which spoke at once her (<font color='blue'><b>Elinor</b></font>)
gratitude, and her (<font color='blue'><b>Elinor</b></font>) conviction of his (<font color='blue'><b>Brandon</b></font>) sharing with herself in the bliss
of the moment. He (<font color='blue'><b>Brandon</b></font>) shared it, however, in a silence even greater than
her (<font color='blue'><b>Elinor</b></font>) own.

<p/>As soon as Mrs. Dashwood had recovered herself, to see Marianne was her (<font color='blue'><b>Marianne</b></font>)
first desire; and in two minutes she (<font color='blue'><b>Marianne</b></font>) was with her (<font color='blue'><b>Marianne</b></font>) beloved child,
rendered dearer to her (<font color='blue'><b>Marianne</b></font>) than ever by absence, unhappiness, and danger.
Elinor's delight, as she (<font color='blue'><b>Elinor</b></font>) saw what each felt in the meeting, was only
checked by an apprehension of its robbing Marianne of farther
sleep;--but Mrs. Dashwood could be calm, could be even prudent, when
the life of a child was at stake, and Marianne, satisfied in knowing
her (<font color='blue'><b>Marianne</b></font>) mother was near her (<font color='blue'><b>Marianne</b></font>), and conscious of being too weak for
conversation, submitted readily to the silence and quiet prescribed by
every nurse around her (<font color='blue'><b>nurse</b></font>). Mrs. Dashwood WOULD sit up with her (<font color='blue'><b>Dashwood</b></font>) all night;
and Elinor, in compliance with her (<font color='blue'><b>Elinor</b></font>) mother's entreaty, went to bed. But
the rest, which one night entirely sleepless, and many hours of the
most wearing anxiety seemed to make requisite, was kept off by
irritation of spirits. Willoughby, <div class="bookquote">``poor Willoughby,''  (<font color='red'><b>Willoughby/Mr. Willoughby</b></font>)</div>as she (<font color='blue'><b>Elinor</b></font>) now
allowed herself to call him (<font color='blue'><b>Willoughby</b></font>), was constantly in her (<font color='blue'><b>Elinor</b></font>) thoughts; she (<font color='blue'><b>Elinor</b></font>) would
not but have heard his (<font color='blue'><b>Willoughby</b></font>) vindication for the world, and now blamed, now
acquitted herself for having judged him (<font color='blue'><b>Willoughby</b></font>) so harshly before. But her (<font color='blue'><b>Elinor</b></font>)
promise of relating it to her (<font color='blue'><b>Elinor</b></font>) sister was invariably painful. She (<font color='blue'><b>Elinor</b></font>)
dreaded the performance of it, dreaded what its effect on Marianne
might be; doubted whether after such an explanation she (<font color='blue'><b>Marianne</b></font>) could ever be
happy with another; and for a moment wished Willoughby a widower.
Then, remembering Colonel Brandon, reproved herself, felt that to HIS (<font color='blue'><b>Colonel</b></font>)
sufferings and his (<font color='blue'><b>Colonel</b></font>) constancy far more than to his (<font color='blue'><b>Colonel</b></font>) rival's, the reward
of her (<font color='blue'><b>Marianne</b></font>) sister was due, and wished any thing rather than Mrs.
Willoughby's death.

<p/>Marianne continued to mend every day, and the brilliant cheerfulness of
Mrs. Dashwood's looks and spirits proved her (<font color='blue'><b>Dashwood</b></font>) to be, as she (<font color='blue'><b>Dashwood</b></font>) repeatedly
declared herself, one of the happiest women in the world. Elinor could
not hear the declaration, nor witness its proofs without sometimes
wondering whether her (<font color='blue'><b>Elinor</b></font>) mother ever recollected Edward. But Mrs.
Dashwood, trusting to the temperate account of her (<font color='blue'><b>Dashwood</b></font>) own disappointment
which Elinor had sent her (<font color='blue'><b>Elinor</b></font>), was led away by the exuberance of her (<font color='blue'><b>Elinor</b></font>) joy to
think only of what would increase it. Marianne was restored to her (<font color='blue'><b>Marianne</b></font>)
from a danger in which, as she (<font color='blue'><b>Marianne</b></font>) now began to feel, her (<font color='blue'><b>Marianne</b></font>) own mistaken
judgment in encouraging the unfortunate attachment to Willoughby, had
contributed to place her (<font color='blue'><b>Marianne</b></font>);--and in her (<font color='blue'><b>Marianne</b></font>) recovery she (<font color='blue'><b>Marianne</b></font>) had yet another
source of joy unthought of by Elinor. It was thus imparted to her (<font color='blue'><b>Elinor</b></font>), as
soon as any opportunity of private conference between them occurred.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``At last we are alone. My Elinor, you do not yet know all my
happiness. Colonel Brandon loves Marianne. He (<font color='blue'><b>Brandon</b></font>) has told me so himself.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``You are never like me, dear Elinor, or I should wonder at your
composure now. Had I sat down to wish for any possible good to my
family, I should have fixed on Colonel Brandon's marrying one of you as
the object most desirable. And I believe Marianne will be the most
happy with him (<font color='blue'><b>Brandon</b></font>) of the two.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Elinor/-- Elinor/ELINOR</b></font>)</div><p/>Elinor was half inclined to ask her (<font color='blue'><b>Elinor</b></font>) reason for thinking so, because
satisfied that none founded on an impartial consideration of their age,
characters, or feelings, could be given;--but her (<font color='blue'><b>Elinor</b></font>) mother must always be
carried away by her (<font color='blue'><b>Elinor</b></font>) imagination on any interesting subject, and
therefore instead of an inquiry, she (<font color='blue'><b>Elinor</b></font>) passed it off with a smile.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``He (<font color='blue'><b>Brandon</b></font>) opened his (<font color='blue'><b>Brandon</b></font>) whole heart to me yesterday as we travelled. It came
out quite unawares, quite undesignedly. I, you may well believe, could
talk of nothing but my child;--he (<font color='blue'><b>Brandon</b></font>) could not conceal his (<font color='blue'><b>Brandon</b></font>) distress; I saw
that it equalled my own, and he (<font color='blue'><b>Brandon</b></font>) perhaps, thinking that mere friendship,
as the world now goes, would not justify so warm a sympathy--or rather,
not thinking at all, I suppose--giving way to irresistible feelings,
made me acquainted with his (<font color='blue'><b>Brandon</b></font>) earnest, tender, constant, affection for
Marianne. He (<font color='blue'><b>Brandon</b></font>) has loved her (<font color='blue'><b>Marianne</b></font>), my Elinor, ever since the first moment of
seeing her (<font color='blue'><b>Elinor</b></font>).''

 (<font color='red'><b>Elinor/-- Elinor/ELINOR</b></font>)</div><p/>Here, however, Elinor perceived,--not the language, not the professions
of Colonel Brandon, but the natural embellishments of her (<font color='blue'><b>Elinor</b></font>) mother's
active fancy, which fashioned every thing delightful to her (<font color='blue'><b>Elinor</b></font>) as it chose.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Colonel Brandon's character,''  (<font color='red'><b>Elinor/-- Elinor/ELINOR</b></font>)</div>said Elinor, <div class="bookquote">``as an excellent man, is
well established.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Elinor/-- Elinor/ELINOR</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``His (<font color='blue'><b>Brandon</b></font>) character, however,''  (<font color='red'><b>Elinor/-- Elinor/ELINOR</b></font>)</div>answered Elinor, <div class="bookquote">``does not rest on ONE act of
kindness, to which his (<font color='blue'><b>Brandon</b></font>) affection for Marianne, were humanity out of the
case, would have prompted him (<font color='blue'><b>Brandon</b></font>). To Mrs. Jennings, to the Middletons, he (<font color='blue'><b>Brandon</b></font>)
has been long and intimately known; they equally love and respect him (<font color='blue'><b>Brandon</b></font>);
and even my own knowledge of him (<font color='blue'><b>Brandon</b></font>), though lately acquired, is very
considerable; and so highly do I value and esteem him (<font color='blue'><b>Brandon</b></font>), that if Marianne
can be happy with him (<font color='blue'><b>Brandon</b></font>), I shall be as ready as yourself to think our
connection the greatest blessing to us in the world. What answer did
you give him (<font color='blue'><b>Brandon</b></font>)?--Did you allow him (<font color='blue'><b>Brandon</b></font>) to hope?''

 (<font color='red'><b>Elinor/-- Elinor/ELINOR</b></font>)</div><p/>Elinor could NOT remember it;--but her (<font color='blue'><b>Elinor</b></font>) mother, without waiting for her (<font color='blue'><b>Elinor</b></font>)
assent, continued,

<p/>Poor Elinor!--here was a new scheme for getting her (<font color='blue'><b>Elinor</b></font>) to Delaford!--but
her (<font color='blue'><b>Elinor</b></font>) spirit was stubborn.

<p/>Here they were interrupted by the entrance of a third person, and
Elinor withdrew to think it all over in private, to wish success to her (<font color='blue'><b>Elinor</b></font>)
friend, and yet in wishing it, to feel a pang for Willoughby.

<p/>His (<font color='blue'><b>Willoughby</b></font>) emotion on entering the room, in seeing her (<font color='blue'><b>Elinor</b></font>) altered looks, and in
receiving the pale hand which she (<font color='blue'><b>Elinor</b></font>) immediately held out to him (<font color='blue'><b>Willoughby</b></font>), was
such, as, in Elinor's conjecture, must arise from something more than
his (<font color='blue'><b>Willoughby</b></font>) affection for Marianne, or the consciousness of its being known to
others; and she (<font color='blue'><b>Marianne</b></font>) soon discovered in his (<font color='blue'><b>Willoughby</b></font>) melancholy eye and varying
complexion as he (<font color='blue'><b>Willoughby</b></font>) looked at her (<font color='blue'><b>Marianne</b></font>) sister, the probable recurrence of many
past scenes of misery to his (<font color='blue'><b>Willoughby</b></font>) mind, brought back by that resemblance
between Marianne and Eliza already acknowledged, and now strengthened
by the hollow eye, the sickly skin, the posture of reclining weakness,
and the warm acknowledgment of peculiar obligation.

<p/>The day of separation and departure arrived; and Marianne, after taking
so particular and lengthened a leave of Mrs. Jennings, one so earnestly
grateful, so full of respect and kind wishes as seemed due to her (<font color='blue'><b>Marianne</b></font>) own
heart from a secret acknowledgment of past inattention, and bidding
Colonel Brandon farewell with a cordiality of a friend, was carefully
assisted by him (<font color='blue'><b>Brandon</b></font>) into the carriage, of which he (<font color='blue'><b>Brandon</b></font>) seemed anxious that she (<font color='blue'><b>Marianne</b></font>)
should engross at least half. Mrs. Dashwood and Elinor then followed,
and the others were left by themselves, to talk of the travellers, and
feel their own dullness, till Mrs. Jennings was summoned to her (<font color='blue'><b>Jennings</b></font>) chaise
to take comfort in the gossip of her (<font color='blue'><b>Jennings</b></font>) maid for the loss of her (<font color='blue'><b>Jennings</b></font>) two young
companions; and Colonel Brandon immediately afterwards took his (<font color='blue'><b>Brandon</b></font>)
solitary way to Delaford.

<p/>The Dashwoods were two days on the road, and Marianne bore her (<font color='blue'><b>Marianne</b></font>) journey
on both, without essential fatigue. Every thing that the most zealous
affection, the most solicitous care could do to render her (<font color='blue'><b>Marianne</b></font>) comfortable,
was the office of each watchful companion, and each found their reward
in her (<font color='blue'><b>Marianne</b></font>) bodily ease, and her (<font color='blue'><b>Marianne</b></font>) calmness of spirits. To Elinor, the
observation of the latter was particularly grateful. She (<font color='blue'><b>Elinor</b></font>), who had seen
her (<font color='blue'><b>Elinor</b></font>) week after week so constantly suffering, oppressed by anguish of
heart which she (<font color='blue'><b>Elinor</b></font>) had neither courage to speak of, nor fortitude to
conceal, now saw with a joy, which no other could equally share, an
apparent composure of mind, which, in being the result as she (<font color='blue'><b>Elinor</b></font>) trusted
of serious reflection, must eventually lead her (<font color='blue'><b>Elinor</b></font>) to contentment and
cheerfulness.

<p/>As they approached Barton, indeed, and entered on scenes of which every
field and every tree brought some peculiar, some painful recollection,
she (<font color='blue'><b>Elinor</b></font>) grew silent and thoughtful, and turning away her (<font color='blue'><b>Elinor</b></font>) face from their
notice, sat earnestly gazing through the window. But here, Elinor
could neither wonder nor blame; and when she (<font color='blue'><b>Elinor</b></font>) saw, as she (<font color='blue'><b>Elinor</b></font>) assisted
Marianne from the carriage, that she (<font color='blue'><b>Marianne</b></font>) had been crying, she (<font color='blue'><b>Marianne</b></font>) saw only an
emotion too natural in itself to raise any thing less tender than pity,
and in its unobtrusiveness entitled to praise. In the whole of her (<font color='blue'><b>Marianne</b></font>)
subsequent manner, she (<font color='blue'><b>Marianne</b></font>) traced the direction of a mind awakened to
reasonable exertion; for no sooner had they entered their common
sitting-room, than Marianne turned her (<font color='blue'><b>Marianne</b></font>) eyes around it with a look of
resolute firmness, as if determined at once to accustom herself to the
sight of every object with which the remembrance of Willoughby could be
connected.--She (<font color='blue'><b>Marianne</b></font>) said little, but every sentence aimed at cheerfulness,
and though a sigh sometimes escaped her (<font color='blue'><b>Marianne</b></font>), it never passed away without
the atonement of a smile. After dinner she (<font color='blue'><b>Marianne</b></font>) would try her (<font color='blue'><b>Marianne</b></font>) piano-forte.
She (<font color='blue'><b>Marianne</b></font>) went to it; but the music on which her (<font color='blue'><b>Marianne</b></font>) eye first rested was an
opera, procured for her (<font color='blue'><b>Marianne</b></font>) by Willoughby, containing some of their
favourite duets, and bearing on its outward leaf her (<font color='blue'><b>Marianne</b></font>) own name in his (<font color='blue'><b>Willoughby</b></font>)
hand-writing.--That would not do.--She (<font color='blue'><b>Marianne</b></font>) shook her (<font color='blue'><b>Marianne</b></font>) head, put the music
aside, and after running over the keys for a minute, complained of
feebleness in her (<font color='blue'><b>Marianne</b></font>) fingers, and closed the instrument again; declaring
however with firmness as she (<font color='blue'><b>Marianne</b></font>) did so, that she (<font color='blue'><b>Marianne</b></font>) should in future practice
much.

<p/>Elinor honoured her (<font color='blue'><b>Elinor</b></font>) for a plan which originated so nobly as this;
though smiling to see the same eager fancy which had been leading her (<font color='blue'><b>Elinor</b></font>)
to the extreme of languid indolence and selfish repining, now at work
in introducing excess into a scheme of such rational employment and
virtuous self-control. Her (<font color='blue'><b>Elinor</b></font>) smile however changed to a sigh when she (<font color='blue'><b>Elinor</b></font>)
remembered that promise to Willoughby was yet unfulfilled, and feared
she (<font color='blue'><b>Elinor</b></font>) had that to communicate which might again unsettle the mind of
Marianne, and ruin at least for a time this fair prospect of busy
tranquillity. Willing therefore to delay the evil hour, she (<font color='blue'><b>Marianne</b></font>) resolved
to wait till her (<font color='blue'><b>Marianne</b></font>) sister's health were more secure, before she (<font color='blue'><b>Marianne</b></font>) appointed
it. But the resolution was made only to be broken.

<p/>Marianne had been two or three days at home, before the weather was
fine enough for an invalid like herself to venture out. But at last a
soft, genial morning appeared; such as might tempt the daughter's
wishes and the mother's confidence; and Marianne, leaning on Elinor's
arm, was authorised to walk as long as she (<font color='blue'><b>Marianne</b></font>) could without fatigue, in
the lane before the house.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``I am thankful to find that I can look with so little pain on the
spot!--shall we ever talk on that subject, Elinor?'' (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>--hesitatingly it
was said.--<div class="bookquote">``Or will it be wrong?--I can talk of it now, I hope, as I
ought to do.'' (<font color='red'><b>Elinor/-- Elinor/ELINOR</b></font>)</div>--

<p/>Elinor tenderly invited her (<font color='blue'><b>Elinor</b></font>) to be open.

<p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>Elinor</b></font>) stopt. Elinor joyfully treasured her (<font color='blue'><b>Elinor</b></font>) words as she (<font color='blue'><b>Elinor</b></font>) answered,

<p/>Elinor said no more. She (<font color='blue'><b>Elinor</b></font>) was debating within herself on the
eligibility of beginning her (<font color='blue'><b>Elinor</b></font>) story directly, or postponing it till
Marianne were in stronger health;--and they crept on for a few minutes
in silence.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``They have borne more than our conduct.--Do not, my dearest Elinor, let
your kindness defend what I know your judgment must censure. My
illness has made me think-- It has given me leisure and calmness for
serious recollection. Long before I was enough recovered to talk, I
was perfectly able to reflect. I considered the past: I saw in my own
behaviour, since the beginning of our acquaintance with him (<font color='blue'><b>acquaintance</b></font>) last
autumn, nothing but a series of imprudence towards myself, and want of
kindness to others. I saw that my own feelings had prepared my
sufferings, and that my want of fortitude under them had almost led me
to the grave. My illness, I well knew, had been entirely brought on by
myself by such negligence of my own health, as I had felt even at the
time to be wrong. Had I died,--it would have been self-destruction. I
did not know my danger till the danger was removed; but with such
feelings as these reflections gave me, I wonder at my recovery,--wonder
that the very eagerness of my desire to live, to have time for
atonement to my God, and to you all, did not kill me at once. Had I
died,--in what peculiar misery should I have left you, my nurse, my
friend, my sister!--You, who had seen all the fretful selfishness of my
latter days; who had known all the murmurings of my heart!--How should
I have lived in YOUR remembrance!--My mother too! How could you have
consoled her (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>)!--I cannot express my own abhorrence of myself. Whenever
I looked towards the past, I saw some duty neglected, or some failing
indulged. Every body seemed injured by me. The kindness, the
unceasing kindness of Mrs. Jennings, I had repaid with ungrateful
contempt. To the Middletons, to the Palmers, the Steeles, to every
common acquaintance even, I had been insolent and unjust; with a heart
hardened against their merits, and a temper irritated by their very
attention.--To John, to Fanny,--yes, even to them, little as they
deserve, I had given less than their due. But you,--you above all,
above my mother, had been wronged by me. I, and only I, knew your
heart and its sorrows; yet to what did it influence me?--not to any
compassion that could benefit you or myself.--Your example was before
me; but to what avail?--Was I more considerate of you and your comfort?
Did I imitate your forbearance, or lessen your restraints, by taking
any part in those offices of general complaisance or particular
gratitude which you had hitherto been left to discharge
alone?--No;--not less when I knew you to be unhappy, than when I had
believed you at ease, did I turn away from every exertion of duty or
friendship; scarcely allowing sorrow to exist but with me, regretting
only THAT heart which had deserted and wronged me, and leaving you, for
whom I professed an unbounded affection, to be miserable for my sake.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/>Here ceased the rapid flow of her (<font color='blue'><b>Marianne</b></font>) self-reproving spirit; and Elinor,
impatient to soothe, though too honest to flatter, gave her (<font color='blue'><b>Elinor</b></font>) instantly
that praise and support which her (<font color='blue'><b>Elinor</b></font>) frankness and her (<font color='blue'><b>Elinor</b></font>) contrition so well
deserved. Marianne pressed her (<font color='blue'><b>Marianne</b></font>) hand and replied,

<p/>Elinor, who had now been for some time reflecting on the propriety or
impropriety of speedily hazarding her (<font color='blue'><b>Marianne</b></font>) narration, without feeling at all
nearer decision than at first, heard this; and perceiving that as
reflection did nothing, resolution must do all, soon found herself
leading to the fact.

<p/>Elinor, dreading her (<font color='blue'><b>Elinor</b></font>) being tired, led her (<font color='blue'><b>Elinor</b></font>) towards home; and till they
reached the door of the cottage, easily conjecturing what her (<font color='blue'><b>Elinor</b></font>) curiosity
must be though no question was suffered to speak it, talked of nothing
but Willoughby, and their conversation together; and was carefully
minute in every particular of speech and look, where minuteness could
be safely indulged. As soon as they entered the house, Marianne with a
kiss of gratitude and these two words just articulate through her (<font color='blue'><b>Marianne</b></font>)
tears, <div class="bookquote">``Tell mama,''  (<font color='red'><b>Marianne/Miss Marianne</b></font>)</div>withdrew from her (<font color='blue'><b>Marianne</b></font>) sister and walked slowly up
stairs. Elinor would not attempt to disturb a solitude so reasonable
as what she (<font color='blue'><b>Elinor</b></font>) now sought; and with a mind anxiously pre-arranging its
result, and a resolution of reviving the subject again, should Marianne
fail to do it, she (<font color='blue'><b>Marianne</b></font>) turned into the parlour to fulfill her (<font color='blue'><b>Marianne</b></font>) parting
injunction.

<p/>Had Mrs. Dashwood, like her (<font color='blue'><b>Dashwood</b></font>) daughter, heard Willoughby's story from
himself--had she (<font color='blue'><b>Dashwood</b></font>) witnessed his (<font color='blue'><b>Willoughby</b></font>) distress, and been under the influence
of his (<font color='blue'><b>Willoughby</b></font>) countenance and his (<font color='blue'><b>Willoughby</b></font>) manner, it is probable that her (<font color='blue'><b>Dashwood</b></font>) compassion
would have been greater. But it was neither in Elinor's power, nor in
her (<font color='blue'><b>Elinor</b></font>) wish, to rouse such feelings in another, by her (<font color='blue'><b>Elinor</b></font>) retailed
explanation, as had at first been called forth in herself. Reflection
had given calmness to her (<font color='blue'><b>Elinor</b></font>) judgment, and sobered her (<font color='blue'><b>Elinor</b></font>) own opinion of
Willoughby's deserts;--she (<font color='blue'><b>Elinor</b></font>) wished, therefore, to declare only the
simple truth, and lay open such facts as were really due to his (<font color='blue'><b>Willoughby</b></font>)
character, without any embellishment of tenderness to lead the fancy
astray.

<p/>Mrs. Dashwood would have interrupted her (<font color='blue'><b>Dashwood</b></font>) instantly with soothing
tenderness, had not Elinor, who really wished to hear her (<font color='blue'><b>Elinor</b></font>) sister's
unbiased opinion, by an eager sign, engaged her (<font color='blue'><b>Elinor</b></font>) silence. Marianne
slowly continued--

<p/><div class="bookquote">``It is a great relief to me--what Elinor told me this morning--I have
now heard exactly what I wished to hear.'' (<font color='red'><b>Marianne/Miss Marianne</b></font>)</div>--For some moments her (<font color='blue'><b>Marianne</b></font>) voice
was lost; but recovering herself, she (<font color='blue'><b>Marianne</b></font>) added, and with greater calmness
than before--<div class="bookquote">``I am now perfectly satisfied, I wish for no change. I
never could have been happy with him (<font color='blue'><b>I</b></font>), after knowing, as sooner or later
I must have known, all this.--I should have had no confidence, no
esteem. Nothing could have done it away to my feelings.''

 (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``You consider the matter,''  (<font color='red'><b>Elinor/-- Elinor/ELINOR</b></font>)</div>said Elinor, <div class="bookquote">``exactly as a good mind and a
sound understanding must consider it; and I dare say you perceive, as
well as myself, not only in this, but in many other circumstances,
reason enough to be convinced that your marriage must have involved you
in many certain troubles and disappointments, in which you would have
been poorly supported by an affection, on his (<font color='blue'><b>You</b></font>) side, much less certain.
Had you married, you must have been always poor. His (<font color='blue'><b>You</b></font>) expensiveness is
acknowledged even by himself, and his (<font color='blue'><b>You</b></font>) whole conduct declares that
self-denial is a word hardly understood by him (<font color='blue'><b>You</b></font>). His (<font color='blue'><b>You</b></font>) demands and your
inexperience together, on a small, very small income, must have brought
on distresses which would not be the LESS grievous to you, from having
been entirely unknown and unthought of before. YOUR sense of honour
and honesty would have led you, I know, when aware of your situation,
to attempt all the economy that would appear to you possible: and,
perhaps, as long as your frugality retrenched only on your own comfort,
you might have been suffered to practice it, but beyond that--and how
little could the utmost of your single management do to stop the ruin
which had begun before your marriage?-- Beyond THAT, had you
endeavoured, however reasonably, to abridge HIS (<font color='blue'><b>you</b></font>) enjoyments, is it not
to be feared, that instead of prevailing on feelings so selfish to
consent to it, you would have lessened your own influence on his (<font color='blue'><b>you</b></font>) heart,
and made him (<font color='blue'><b>you</b></font>) regret the connection which had involved him (<font color='blue'><b>you</b></font>) in such
difficulties?''

 (<font color='red'><b>Elinor/-- Elinor/ELINOR</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``The whole of his (<font color='blue'><b>you</b></font>) behaviour,''  (<font color='red'><b>Elinor/-- Elinor/ELINOR</b></font>)</div>replied Elinor, <div class="bookquote">``from the beginning to
the end of the affair, has been grounded on selfishness. It was
selfishness which first made him (<font color='blue'><b>you</b></font>) sport with your affections; which
afterwards, when his (<font color='blue'><b>you</b></font>) own were engaged, made him (<font color='blue'><b>you</b></font>) delay the confession of
it, and which finally carried him (<font color='blue'><b>you</b></font>) from Barton. His (<font color='blue'><b>Barton</b></font>) own enjoyment, or
his (<font color='blue'><b>Barton</b></font>) own ease, was, in every particular, his (<font color='blue'><b>Barton</b></font>) ruling principle.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Elinor/-- Elinor/ELINOR</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``At present,''  (<font color='red'><b>Elinor/-- Elinor/ELINOR</b></font>)</div>continued Elinor, <div class="bookquote">``he (<font color='blue'><b>Barton</b></font>) regrets what he (<font color='blue'><b>Barton</b></font>) has done. And why
does he (<font color='blue'><b>Barton</b></font>) regret it?--Because he (<font color='blue'><b>Barton</b></font>) finds it has not answered towards
himself. It has not made him (<font color='blue'><b>Barton</b></font>) happy. His (<font color='blue'><b>Barton</b></font>) circumstances are now
unembarrassed--he (<font color='blue'><b>Barton</b></font>) suffers from no evil of that kind; and he (<font color='blue'><b>Barton</b></font>) thinks only
that he (<font color='blue'><b>Barton</b></font>) has married a woman of a less amiable temper than yourself.
But does it follow that had he (<font color='blue'><b>Barton</b></font>) married you, he (<font color='blue'><b>Barton</b></font>) would have been
happy?--The inconveniences would have been different. He (<font color='blue'><b>Barton</b></font>) would then
have suffered under the pecuniary distresses which, because they are
removed, he (<font color='blue'><b>Barton</b></font>) now reckons as nothing. He (<font color='blue'><b>Barton</b></font>) would have had a wife of whose
temper he (<font color='blue'><b>Barton</b></font>) could make no complaint, but he (<font color='blue'><b>Barton</b></font>) would have been always
necessitous--always poor; and probably would soon have learned to rank
the innumerable comforts of a clear estate and good income as of far
more importance, even to domestic happiness, than the mere temper of a
wife.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Elinor/-- Elinor/ELINOR</b></font>)</div><p/>Marianne would not let her (<font color='blue'><b>Elinor</b></font>) proceed;--and Elinor, satisfied that each
felt their own error, wished to avoid any survey of the past that might
weaken her (<font color='blue'><b>Elinor</b></font>) sister's spirits; she (<font color='blue'><b>Elinor</b></font>), therefore, pursuing the first
subject, immediately continued,

<p/>Elinor, according to her (<font color='blue'><b>Elinor</b></font>) expectation, saw on the two or three following
days, that Marianne did not continue to gain strength as she (<font color='blue'><b>Marianne</b></font>) had done;
but while her (<font color='blue'><b>Marianne</b></font>) resolution was unsubdued, and she (<font color='blue'><b>Marianne</b></font>) still tried to appear
cheerful and easy, her (<font color='blue'><b>Marianne</b></font>) sister could safely trust to the effect of time
upon her (<font color='blue'><b>Marianne</b></font>) health.

<p/>Elinor grew impatient for some tidings of Edward. She (<font color='blue'><b>Elinor</b></font>) had heard
nothing of him (<font color='blue'><b>Edward</b></font>) since her (<font color='blue'><b>Elinor</b></font>) leaving London, nothing new of his (<font color='blue'><b>Edward</b></font>) plans,
nothing certain even of his (<font color='blue'><b>Edward</b></font>) present abode. Some letters had passed
between her (<font color='blue'><b>Elinor</b></font>) and her (<font color='blue'><b>Elinor</b></font>) brother, in consequence of Marianne's illness; and
in the first of John's, there had been this sentence:-- <div class="bookquote">``We know
nothing of our unfortunate Edward, and can make no enquiries on so
prohibited a subject, but conclude him (<font color='blue'><b>Edward</b></font>) to be still at Oxford;''  (<font color='red'><b>Mrs. Dashwood/John/Mrs. John Dashwood</b></font>)</div>which
was all the intelligence of Edward afforded her (<font color='blue'><b>John</b></font>) by the correspondence,
for his (<font color='blue'><b>Edward</b></font>) name was not even mentioned in any of the succeeding letters.
She (<font color='blue'><b>John</b></font>) was not doomed, however, to be long in ignorance of his (<font color='blue'><b>Edward</b></font>) measures.

<p/>Marianne gave a violent start, fixed her (<font color='blue'><b>Marianne</b></font>) eyes upon Elinor, saw her (<font color='blue'><b>Elinor</b></font>)
turning pale, and fell back in her (<font color='blue'><b>Elinor</b></font>) chair in hysterics. Mrs. Dashwood,
whose eyes, as she (<font color='blue'><b>Dashwood</b></font>) answered the servant's inquiry, had intuitively
taken the same direction, was shocked to perceive by Elinor's
countenance how much she (<font color='blue'><b>Elinor</b></font>) really suffered, and a moment afterwards,
alike distressed by Marianne's situation, knew not on which child to
bestow her (<font color='blue'><b>Marianne</b></font>) principal attention.

<p/>The servant, who saw only that Miss Marianne was taken ill, had sense
enough to call one of the maids, who, with Mrs. Dashwood's assistance,
supported her (<font color='blue'><b>Dashwood</b></font>) into the other room. By that time, Marianne was rather
better, and her (<font color='blue'><b>Marianne</b></font>) mother leaving her (<font color='blue'><b>Marianne</b></font>) to the care of Margaret and the
maid, returned to Elinor, who, though still much disordered, had so far
recovered the use of her (<font color='blue'><b>Elinor</b></font>) reason and voice as to be just beginning an
inquiry of Thomas, as to the source of his (<font color='blue'><b>Thomas</b></font>) intelligence. Mrs. Dashwood
immediately took all that trouble on herself; and Elinor had the
benefit of the information without the exertion of seeking it.

<p/>Elinor's heart could easily account for his (<font color='blue'><b>Thomas</b></font>) not putting himself
forward; and Mrs. Dashwood probably found the same explanation.

<p/>Mrs. Dashwood now looked at her (<font color='blue'><b>Dashwood</b></font>) daughter; but Elinor knew better than
to expect them. She (<font color='blue'><b>Elinor</b></font>) recognised the whole of Lucy in the message, and
was very confident that Edward would never come near them. She (<font color='blue'><b>Elinor</b></font>)
observed in a low voice, to her (<font color='blue'><b>Elinor</b></font>) mother, that they were probably going
down to Mr. Pratt's, near Plymouth.

<p/>Thomas's intelligence seemed over. Elinor looked as if she (<font color='blue'><b>Elinor</b></font>) wished to
hear more.

<p/>Mrs. Dashwood could think of no other question, and Thomas and the
tablecloth, now alike needless, were soon afterwards dismissed.
Marianne had already sent to say, that she (<font color='blue'><b>Marianne</b></font>) should eat nothing more.
Mrs. Dashwood's and Elinor's appetites were equally lost, and Margaret
might think herself very well off, that with so much uneasiness as both
her (<font color='blue'><b>Margaret</b></font>) sisters had lately experienced, so much reason as they had often
had to be careless of their meals, she (<font color='blue'><b>Margaret</b></font>) had never been obliged to go
without her (<font color='blue'><b>Margaret</b></font>) dinner before.

<p/>When the dessert and the wine were arranged, and Mrs. Dashwood and
Elinor were left by themselves, they remained long together in a
similarity of thoughtfulness and silence. Mrs. Dashwood feared to
hazard any remark, and ventured not to offer consolation. She (<font color='blue'><b>Dashwood</b></font>) now
found that she (<font color='blue'><b>Dashwood</b></font>) had erred in relying on Elinor's representation of
herself; and justly concluded that every thing had been expressly
softened at the time, to spare her (<font color='blue'><b>Elinor</b></font>) from an increase of unhappiness,
suffering as she (<font color='blue'><b>Elinor</b></font>) then had suffered for Marianne. She (<font color='blue'><b>Marianne</b></font>) found that she (<font color='blue'><b>Marianne</b></font>)
had been misled by the careful, the considerate attention of her (<font color='blue'><b>Marianne</b></font>)
daughter, to think the attachment, which once she (<font color='blue'><b>Marianne</b></font>) had so well
understood, much slighter in reality, than she (<font color='blue'><b>Marianne</b></font>) had been wont to
believe, or than it was now proved to be. She (<font color='blue'><b>Marianne</b></font>) feared that under this
persuasion she (<font color='blue'><b>Marianne</b></font>) had been unjust, inattentive, nay, almost unkind, to her (<font color='blue'><b>Marianne</b></font>)
Elinor;--that Marianne's affliction, because more acknowledged, more
immediately before her (<font color='blue'><b>Marianne</b></font>), had too much engrossed her (<font color='blue'><b>Marianne</b></font>) tenderness, and led
her (<font color='blue'><b>Marianne</b></font>) away to forget that in Elinor she (<font color='blue'><b>Elinor</b></font>) might have a daughter suffering
almost as much, certainly with less self-provocation, and greater
fortitude.

<p/>Elinor now found the difference between the expectation of an
unpleasant event, however certain the mind may be told to consider it,
and certainty itself. She (<font color='blue'><b>Elinor</b></font>) now found, that in spite of herself, she (<font color='blue'><b>Elinor</b></font>) had
always admitted a hope, while Edward remained single, that something
would occur to prevent his (<font color='blue'><b>Edward</b></font>) marrying Lucy; that some resolution of his (<font color='blue'><b>Edward</b></font>)
own, some mediation of friends, or some more eligible opportunity of
establishment for the lady, would arise to assist the happiness of all.
But he (<font color='blue'><b>Edward</b></font>) was now married; and she (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) condemned her (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) heart for the lurking
flattery, which so much heightened the pain of the intelligence.

<p/>Elinor flattered herself that some one of their connections in London
would write to them to announce the event, and give farther
particulars,--but day after day passed off, and brought no letter, no
tidings. Though uncertain that any one were to blame, she (<font color='blue'><b>Elinor</b></font>) found fault
with every absent friend. They were all thoughtless or indolent.

<p/>His (<font color='blue'><b>friend</b></font>) countenance, as he (<font color='blue'><b>friend</b></font>) entered the room, was not too happy, even for
Elinor. His (<font color='blue'><b>friend</b></font>) complexion was white with agitation, and he (<font color='blue'><b>friend</b></font>) looked as if
fearful of his (<font color='blue'><b>friend</b></font>) reception, and conscious that he (<font color='blue'><b>friend</b></font>) merited no kind one.
Mrs. Dashwood, however, conforming, as she (<font color='blue'><b>Dashwood</b></font>) trusted, to the wishes of
that daughter, by whom she (<font color='blue'><b>Dashwood</b></font>) then meant in the warmth of her (<font color='blue'><b>Dashwood</b></font>) heart to be
guided in every thing, met with a look of forced complacency, gave him (<font color='blue'><b>friend</b></font>)
her (<font color='blue'><b>Dashwood</b></font>) hand, and wished him (<font color='blue'><b>friend</b></font>) joy.

<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>friend</b></font>) coloured, and stammered out an unintelligible reply. Elinor's lips
had moved with her (<font color='blue'><b>Elinor</b></font>) mother's, and, when the moment of action was over,
she (<font color='blue'><b>Elinor</b></font>) wished that she (<font color='blue'><b>Elinor</b></font>) had shaken hands with him (<font color='blue'><b>friend</b></font>) too. But it was then too
late, and with a countenance meaning to be open, she (<font color='blue'><b>Elinor</b></font>) sat down again and
talked of the weather.

<p/>When Elinor had ceased to rejoice in the dryness of the season, a very
awful pause took place. It was put an end to by Mrs. Dashwood, who
felt obliged to hope that he (<font color='blue'><b>friend</b></font>) had left Mrs. Ferrars very well. In a
hurried manner, he (<font color='blue'><b>friend</b></font>) replied in the affirmative.

<p/>Elinor resolving to exert herself, though fearing the sound of her (<font color='blue'><b>Elinor</b></font>) own
voice, now said,

<p/><div class="bookquote">``I meant,''  (<font color='red'><b>Elinor/-- Elinor/ELINOR</b></font>)</div>said Elinor, taking up some work from the table, <div class="bookquote">``to inquire
for Mrs. EDWARD Ferrars.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Elinor/-- Elinor/ELINOR</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Mrs. Robert Ferrars!'' (<font color='red'><b>Marianne/Miss Marianne</b></font>)</div>--was repeated by Marianne and her (<font color='blue'><b>Elinor</b></font>) mother in an
accent of the utmost amazement;--and though Elinor could not speak,
even HER eyes were fixed on him (<font color='blue'><b>friend</b></font>) with the same impatient wonder. He (<font color='blue'><b>friend</b></font>)
rose from his (<font color='blue'><b>friend</b></font>) seat, and walked to the window, apparently from not
knowing what to do; took up a pair of scissors that lay there, and
while spoiling both them and their sheath by cutting the latter to
pieces as he (<font color='blue'><b>friend</b></font>) spoke, said, in a hurried voice,

<p/>His (<font color='blue'><b>friend</b></font>) words were echoed with unspeakable astonishment by all but Elinor,
who sat with her (<font color='blue'><b>Elinor</b></font>) head leaning over her (<font color='blue'><b>Elinor</b></font>) work, in a state of such
agitation as made her (<font color='blue'><b>Elinor</b></font>) hardly know where she (<font color='blue'><b>Elinor</b></font>) was.

<p/>Elinor could sit it no longer. She (<font color='blue'><b>Elinor</b></font>) almost ran out of the room, and as
soon as the door was closed, burst into tears of joy, which at first
she (<font color='blue'><b>Elinor</b></font>) thought would never cease. Edward, who had till then looked any
where, rather than at her (<font color='blue'><b>Elinor</b></font>), saw her (<font color='blue'><b>Elinor</b></font>) hurry away, and perhaps saw--or even
heard, her (<font color='blue'><b>Elinor</b></font>) emotion; for immediately afterwards he (<font color='blue'><b>Edward</b></font>) fell into a reverie,
which no remarks, no inquiries, no affectionate address of Mrs.
Dashwood could penetrate, and at last, without saying a word, quitted
the room, and walked out towards the village--leaving the others in the
greatest astonishment and perplexity on a change in his (<font color='blue'><b>Edward</b></font>) situation, so
wonderful and so sudden;--a perplexity which they had no means of
lessening but by their own conjectures.

<p/>His (<font color='blue'><b>Edward</b></font>) errand at Barton, in fact, was a simple one. It was only to ask
Elinor to marry him (<font color='blue'><b>Edward</b></font>);--and considering that he (<font color='blue'><b>Edward</b></font>) was not altogether
inexperienced in such a question, it might be strange that he (<font color='blue'><b>Edward</b></font>) should
feel so uncomfortable in the present case as he (<font color='blue'><b>Edward</b></font>) really did, so much in
need of encouragement and fresh air.

<p/>His (<font color='blue'><b>Edward</b></font>) heart was now open to Elinor, all its weaknesses, all its errors
confessed, and his (<font color='blue'><b>Edward</b></font>) first boyish attachment to Lucy treated with all the
philosophic dignity of twenty-four.

<p/>The change which a few hours had wrought in the minds and the happiness
of the Dashwoods, was such--so great--as promised them all, the
satisfaction of a sleepless night. Mrs. Dashwood, too happy to be
comfortable, knew not how to love Edward, nor praise Elinor enough, how
to be enough thankful for his (<font color='blue'><b>Edward</b></font>) release without wounding his (<font color='blue'><b>Edward</b></font>) delicacy,
nor how at once to give them leisure for unrestrained conversation
together, and yet enjoy, as she (<font color='blue'><b>Elinor</b></font>) wished, the sight and society of both.

<p/>But Elinor--how are HER feelings to be described?--From the moment of
learning that Lucy was married to another, that Edward was free, to the
moment of his (<font color='blue'><b>Edward</b></font>) justifying the hopes which had so instantly followed, she (<font color='blue'><b>Lucy</b></font>)
was every thing by turns but tranquil. But when the second moment had
passed, when she (<font color='blue'><b>Lucy</b></font>) found every doubt, every solicitude removed, compared
her (<font color='blue'><b>Lucy</b></font>) situation with what so lately it had been,--saw him (<font color='blue'><b>Edward</b></font>) honourably
released from his (<font color='blue'><b>Edward</b></font>) former engagement, saw him (<font color='blue'><b>Edward</b></font>) instantly profiting by the
release, to address herself and declare an affection as tender, as
constant as she (<font color='blue'><b>Lucy</b></font>) had ever supposed it to be,--she (<font color='blue'><b>Lucy</b></font>) was oppressed, she (<font color='blue'><b>Lucy</b></font>) was
overcome by her (<font color='blue'><b>Lucy</b></font>) own felicity;--and happily disposed as is the human
mind to be easily familiarized with any change for the better, it
required several hours to give sedateness to her (<font color='blue'><b>Lucy</b></font>) spirits, or any degree
of tranquillity to her (<font color='blue'><b>Lucy</b></font>) heart.

<p/>Edward was now fixed at the cottage at least for a week;--for whatever
other claims might be made on him (<font color='blue'><b>Edward</b></font>), it was impossible that less than a
week should be given up to the enjoyment of Elinor's company, or
suffice to say half that was to be said of the past, the present, and
the future;--for though a very few hours spent in the hard labor of
incessant talking will despatch more subjects than can really be in
common between any two rational creatures, yet with lovers it is
different. Between THEM no subject is finished, no communication is
even made, till it has been made at least twenty times over.

<p/>Lucy's marriage, the unceasing and reasonable wonder among them all,
formed of course one of the earliest discussions of the lovers;--and
Elinor's particular knowledge of each party made it appear to her (<font color='blue'><b>Elinor</b></font>) in
every view, as one of the most extraordinary and unaccountable
circumstances she (<font color='blue'><b>Elinor</b></font>) had ever heard. How they could be thrown together,
and by what attraction Robert could be drawn on to marry a girl, of
whose beauty she (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) had herself heard him (<font color='blue'><b>Robert</b></font>) speak without any admiration,--a
girl too already engaged to his (<font color='blue'><b>Robert</b></font>) brother, and on whose account that
brother had been thrown off by his (<font color='blue'><b>brother</b></font>) family--it was beyond her (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>)
comprehension to make out. To her (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) own heart it was a delightful
affair, to her (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) imagination it was even a ridiculous one, but to her (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>)
reason, her (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) judgment, it was completely a puzzle.

<p/>Edward could only attempt an explanation by supposing, that, perhaps,
at first accidentally meeting, the vanity of the one had been so worked
on by the flattery of the other, as to lead by degrees to all the rest.
Elinor remembered what Robert had told her (<font color='blue'><b>Elinor</b></font>) in Harley Street, of his (<font color='blue'><b>Robert</b></font>)
opinion of what his (<font color='blue'><b>Robert</b></font>) own mediation in his (<font color='blue'><b>Robert</b></font>) brother's affairs might have
done, if applied to in time. She (<font color='blue'><b>Elinor</b></font>) repeated it to Edward.

<p/>How long it had been carrying on between them, however, he (<font color='blue'><b>Edward</b></font>) was equally
at a loss with herself to make out; for at Oxford, where he (<font color='blue'><b>Edward</b></font>) had
remained for choice ever since his (<font color='blue'><b>Edward</b></font>) quitting London, he (<font color='blue'><b>Edward</b></font>) had had no means
of hearing of her (<font color='blue'><b>Elinor</b></font>) but from herself, and her (<font color='blue'><b>Elinor</b></font>) letters to the very last
were neither less frequent, nor less affectionate than usual. Not the
smallest suspicion, therefore, had ever occurred to prepare him (<font color='blue'><b>Edward</b></font>) for
what followed;--and when at last it burst on him (<font color='blue'><b>Edward</b></font>) in a letter from Lucy
herself, he (<font color='blue'><b>Edward</b></font>) had been for some time, he (<font color='blue'><b>Edward</b></font>) believed, half stupified between
the wonder, the horror, and the joy of such a deliverance. He (<font color='blue'><b>Edward</b></font>) put the
letter into Elinor's hands.

<p/>Elinor read and returned it without any comment.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``However it may have come about,''  (<font color='red'><b>Elinor/-- Elinor/ELINOR</b></font>)</div>said Elinor, after a pause,--<div class="bookquote">``they
are certainly married. And your mother has brought on herself a most
appropriate punishment. The independence she (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) settled on Robert,
through resentment against you, has put it in his (<font color='blue'><b>Robert</b></font>) power to make his (<font color='blue'><b>Robert</b></font>) own
choice; and she (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) has actually been bribing one son with a thousand
a-year, to do the very deed which she (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) disinherited the other for
intending to do. She (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) will hardly be less hurt, I suppose, by Robert's
marrying Lucy, than she (<font color='blue'><b>Lucy</b></font>) would have been by your marrying her (<font color='blue'><b>Lucy</b></font>).''

 (<font color='red'><b>Elinor/-- Elinor/ELINOR</b></font>)</div><p/>That Lucy had certainly meant to deceive, to go off with a flourish of
malice against him (<font color='blue'><b>Edward</b></font>) in her (<font color='blue'><b>Lucy</b></font>) message by Thomas, was perfectly clear to
Elinor; and Edward himself, now thoroughly enlightened on her (<font color='blue'><b>Elinor</b></font>)
character, had no scruple in believing her (<font color='blue'><b>Elinor</b></font>) capable of the utmost
meanness of wanton ill-nature. Though his (<font color='blue'><b>Edward</b></font>) eyes had been long opened,
even before his (<font color='blue'><b>Edward</b></font>) acquaintance with Elinor began, to her (<font color='blue'><b>Elinor</b></font>) ignorance and a
want of liberality in some of her (<font color='blue'><b>Elinor</b></font>) opinions--they had been equally
imputed, by him (<font color='blue'><b>Edward</b></font>), to her (<font color='blue'><b>Elinor</b></font>) want of education; and till her (<font color='blue'><b>Elinor</b></font>) last letter
reached him (<font color='blue'><b>Edward</b></font>), he (<font color='blue'><b>Edward</b></font>) had always believed her (<font color='blue'><b>Elinor</b></font>) to be a well-disposed,
good-hearted girl, and thoroughly attached to himself. Nothing but
such a persuasion could have prevented his (<font color='blue'><b>Edward</b></font>) putting an end to an
engagement, which, long before the discovery of it laid him (<font color='blue'><b>Edward</b></font>) open to his (<font color='blue'><b>Edward</b></font>)
mother's anger, had been a continual source of disquiet and regret to
him (<font color='blue'><b>Edward</b></font>).

<p/>Elinor scolded him (<font color='blue'><b>Edward</b></font>), harshly as ladies always scold the imprudence which
compliments themselves, for having spent so much time with them at
Norland, when he (<font color='blue'><b>Edward</b></font>) must have felt his (<font color='blue'><b>Edward</b></font>) own inconstancy.

<p/>Elinor smiled, and shook her (<font color='blue'><b>Elinor</b></font>) head.

<p/>NOW he (<font color='blue'><b>Edward</b></font>) felt astonished himself that he (<font color='blue'><b>Edward</b></font>) had never yet been to the place.
But so little interest had he (<font color='blue'><b>Edward</b></font>) taken in the matter, that he (<font color='blue'><b>Edward</b></font>) owed all his (<font color='blue'><b>Edward</b></font>)
knowledge of the house, garden, and glebe, extent of the parish,
condition of the land, and rate of the tithes, to Elinor herself, who
had heard so much of it from Colonel Brandon, and heard it with so much
attention, as to be entirely mistress of the subject.

<p/>One question after this only remained undecided, between them, one
difficulty only was to be overcome. They were brought together by
mutual affection, with the warmest approbation of their real friends;
their intimate knowledge of each other seemed to make their happiness
certain--and they only wanted something to live upon. Edward had two
thousand pounds, and Elinor one, which, with Delaford living, was all
that they could call their own; for it was impossible that Mrs.
Dashwood should advance anything; and they were neither of them quite
enough in love to think that three hundred and fifty pounds a-year
would supply them with the comforts of life.

<p/>Edward was not entirely without hopes of some favourable change in his (<font color='blue'><b>Edward</b></font>)
mother towards him (<font color='blue'><b>Edward</b></font>); and on THAT he (<font color='blue'><b>Edward</b></font>) rested for the residue of their
income. But Elinor had no such dependence; for since Edward would
still be unable to marry Miss Morton, and his (<font color='blue'><b>Edward</b></font>) chusing herself had been
spoken of in Mrs. Ferrars's flattering language as only a lesser evil
than his (<font color='blue'><b>Edward</b></font>) chusing Lucy Steele, she (<font color='blue'><b>Steele</b></font>) feared that Robert's offence would
serve no other purpose than to enrich Fanny.

<p/>A three weeks' residence at Delaford, where, in his (<font color='blue'><b>Edward</b></font>) evening hours at
least, he (<font color='blue'><b>Edward</b></font>) had little to do but to calculate the disproportion between
thirty-six and seventeen, brought him (<font color='blue'><b>Edward</b></font>) to Barton in a temper of mind
which needed all the improvement in Marianne's looks, all the kindness
of her (<font color='blue'><b>Marianne</b></font>) welcome, and all the encouragement of her (<font color='blue'><b>Marianne</b></font>) mother's language, to
make it cheerful. Among such friends, however, and such flattery, he (<font color='blue'><b>Barton</b></font>)
did revive. No rumour of Lucy's marriage had yet reached him (<font color='blue'><b>Barton</b></font>):--he (<font color='blue'><b>Barton</b></font>) knew
nothing of what had passed; and the first hours of his (<font color='blue'><b>Barton</b></font>) visit were
consequently spent in hearing and in wondering. Every thing was
explained to him (<font color='blue'><b>Barton</b></font>) by Mrs. Dashwood, and he (<font color='blue'><b>Barton</b></font>) found fresh reason to rejoice
in what he (<font color='blue'><b>Barton</b></font>) had done for Mr. Ferrars, since eventually it promoted the
interest of Elinor.

<p/>The letters from town, which a few days before would have made every
nerve in Elinor's body thrill with transport, now arrived to be read
with less emotion than mirth. Mrs. Jennings wrote to tell the
wonderful tale, to vent her (<font color='blue'><b>Jennings</b></font>) honest indignation against the jilting
girl, and pour forth her (<font color='blue'><b>Jennings</b></font>) compassion towards poor Mr. Edward, who, she (<font color='blue'><b>Jennings</b></font>)
was sure, had quite doted upon the worthless hussy, and was now, by all
accounts, almost broken-hearted, at Oxford.-- <div class="bookquote">``I do think,''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Jennings</b></font>)
continued, <div class="bookquote">``nothing was ever carried on so sly; for it was but two days
before Lucy called and sat a couple of hours with me. Not a soul
suspected anything of the matter, not even Nancy, who, poor soul! came
crying to me the day after, in a great fright for fear of Mrs. Ferrars,
as well as not knowing how to get to Plymouth; for Lucy it seems
borrowed all her (<font color='blue'><b>Lucy</b></font>) money before she (<font color='blue'><b>Lucy</b></font>) went off to be married, on purpose we
suppose to make a show with, and poor Nancy had not seven shillings in
the world;--so I was very glad to give her (<font color='blue'><b>Nancy</b></font>) five guineas to take her (<font color='blue'><b>Nancy</b></font>)
down to Exeter, where she (<font color='blue'><b>Nancy</b></font>) thinks of staying three or four weeks with
Mrs. Burgess, in hopes, as I tell her (<font color='blue'><b>Burgess</b></font>), to fall in with the Doctor
again. And I must say that Lucy's crossness not to take them along
with them in the chaise is worse than all. Poor Mr. Edward! I cannot
get him (<font color='blue'><b>Edward</b></font>) out of my head, but you must send for him (<font color='blue'><b>Edward</b></font>) to Barton, and Miss
Marianne must try to comfort him (<font color='blue'><b>Barton</b></font>).''

 (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div><p/>Mr. Dashwood's strains were more solemn. Mrs. Ferrars was the most
unfortunate of women--poor Fanny had suffered agonies of
sensibility--and he (<font color='blue'><b>Dashwood</b></font>) considered the existence of each, under such a
blow, with grateful wonder. Robert's offence was unpardonable, but
Lucy's was infinitely worse. Neither of them were ever again to be
mentioned to Mrs. Ferrars; and even, if she (<font color='blue'><b>Ferrars</b></font>) might hereafter be induced
to forgive her (<font color='blue'><b>Ferrars</b></font>) son, his (<font color='blue'><b>son</b></font>) wife should never be acknowledged as her (<font color='blue'><b>Ferrars</b></font>)
daughter, nor be permitted to appear in her (<font color='blue'><b>Ferrars</b></font>) presence. The secrecy with
which everything had been carried on between them, was rationally
treated as enormously heightening the crime, because, had any suspicion
of it occurred to the others, proper measures would have been taken to
prevent the marriage; and he (<font color='blue'><b>son</b></font>) called on Elinor to join with him (<font color='blue'><b>son</b></font>) in
regretting that Lucy's engagement with Edward had not rather been
fulfilled, than that she (<font color='blue'><b>Lucy</b></font>) should thus be the means of spreading misery
farther in the family.-- He (<font color='blue'><b>Edward</b></font>) thus continued:

<p/><div class="bookquote">``You may certainly ask to be forgiven,''  (<font color='red'><b>He</b></font>)</div>said Elinor, <div class="bookquote">``because you have
offended;--and I should think you might NOW venture so far as to
profess some concern for having ever formed the engagement which drew
on you your mother's anger.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Elinor/-- Elinor/ELINOR</b></font>)</div><p/>In spite of his (<font color='blue'><b>Edward</b></font>) being allowed once more to live, however, he (<font color='blue'><b>Edward</b></font>) did not
feel the continuance of his (<font color='blue'><b>Edward</b></font>) existence secure, till he (<font color='blue'><b>Edward</b></font>) had revealed his (<font color='blue'><b>Edward</b></font>)
present engagement; for the publication of that circumstance, he (<font color='blue'><b>Edward</b></font>)
feared, might give a sudden turn to his (<font color='blue'><b>Edward</b></font>) constitution, and carry him (<font color='blue'><b>Edward</b></font>) off
as rapidly as before. With apprehensive caution therefore it was
revealed, and he (<font color='blue'><b>Edward</b></font>) was listened to with unexpected calmness. Mrs.
Ferrars at first reasonably endeavoured to dissuade him (<font color='blue'><b>Edward</b></font>) from marrying
Miss Dashwood, by every argument in her (<font color='blue'><b>Dashwood</b></font>) power;--told him (<font color='blue'><b>Edward</b></font>), that in Miss
Morton he (<font color='blue'><b>Edward</b></font>) would have a woman of higher rank and larger fortune;--and
enforced the assertion, by observing that Miss Morton was the daughter
of a nobleman with thirty thousand pounds, while Miss Dashwood was only
the daughter of a private gentleman with no more than THREE; but when
she (<font color='blue'><b>Dashwood</b></font>) found that, though perfectly admitting the truth of her (<font color='blue'><b>Dashwood</b></font>)
representation, he (<font color='blue'><b>gentleman</b></font>) was by no means inclined to be guided by it, she (<font color='blue'><b>Dashwood</b></font>)
judged it wisest, from the experience of the past, to submit--and
therefore, after such an ungracious delay as she (<font color='blue'><b>Dashwood</b></font>) owed to her (<font color='blue'><b>Dashwood</b></font>) own
dignity, and as served to prevent every suspicion of good-will, she (<font color='blue'><b>Dashwood</b></font>)
issued her (<font color='blue'><b>Dashwood</b></font>) decree of consent to the marriage of Edward and Elinor.

<p/>It was as much, however, as was desired, and more than was expected, by
Edward and Elinor; and Mrs. Ferrars herself, by her (<font color='blue'><b>Ferrars</b></font>) shuffling excuses,
seemed the only person surprised at her (<font color='blue'><b>Ferrars</b></font>) not giving more.

<p/>With an income quite sufficient to their wants thus secured to them,
they had nothing to wait for after Edward was in possession of the
living, but the readiness of the house, to which Colonel Brandon, with
an eager desire for the accommodation of Elinor, was making
considerable improvements; and after waiting some time for their
completion, after experiencing, as usual, a thousand disappointments
and delays from the unaccountable dilatoriness of the workmen, Elinor,
as usual, broke through the first positive resolution of not marrying
till every thing was ready, and the ceremony took place in Barton
church early in the autumn.

<p/>The first month after their marriage was spent with their friend at the
Mansion-house; from whence they could superintend the progress of the
Parsonage, and direct every thing as they liked on the spot;--could
chuse papers, project shrubberies, and invent a sweep. Mrs. Jennings's
prophecies, though rather jumbled together, were chiefly fulfilled; for
she (<font color='blue'><b>Jennings</b></font>) was able to visit Edward and his (<font color='blue'><b>Edward</b></font>) wife in their Parsonage by
Michaelmas, and she (<font color='blue'><b>Jennings</b></font>) found in Elinor and her (<font color='blue'><b>Elinor</b></font>) husband, as she (<font color='blue'><b>Elinor</b></font>) really
believed, one of the happiest couples in the world. They had in fact
nothing to wish for, but the marriage of Colonel Brandon and Marianne,
and rather better pasturage for their cows.

<p/>The whole of Lucy's behaviour in the affair, and the prosperity which
crowned it, therefore, may be held forth as a most encouraging instance
of what an earnest, an unceasing attention to self-interest, however
its progress may be apparently obstructed, will do in securing every
advantage of fortune, with no other sacrifice than that of time and
conscience. When Robert first sought her (<font color='blue'><b>Lucy</b></font>) acquaintance, and privately
visited her (<font color='blue'><b>Lucy</b></font>) in Bartlett's Buildings, it was only with the view imputed
to him (<font color='blue'><b>Bartlett</b></font>) by his (<font color='blue'><b>Bartlett</b></font>) brother. He (<font color='blue'><b>Bartlett</b></font>) merely meant to persuade her (<font color='blue'><b>Lucy</b></font>) to give up the
engagement; and as there could be nothing to overcome but the affection
of both, he (<font color='blue'><b>Bartlett</b></font>) naturally expected that one or two interviews would settle
the matter. In that point, however, and that only, he (<font color='blue'><b>Bartlett</b></font>) erred;--for
though Lucy soon gave him (<font color='blue'><b>Bartlett</b></font>) hopes that his (<font color='blue'><b>Bartlett</b></font>) eloquence would convince her (<font color='blue'><b>Lucy</b></font>)
in TIME, another visit, another conversation, was always wanted to
produce this conviction. Some doubts always lingered in her (<font color='blue'><b>Lucy</b></font>) mind when
they parted, which could only be removed by another half hour's
discourse with himself. His (<font color='blue'><b>Bartlett</b></font>) attendance was by this means secured, and
the rest followed in course. Instead of talking of Edward, they came
gradually to talk only of Robert,--a subject on which he (<font color='blue'><b>Robert</b></font>) had always
more to say than on any other, and in which she (<font color='blue'><b>Lucy</b></font>) soon betrayed an
interest even equal to his (<font color='blue'><b>Robert</b></font>) own; and in short, it became speedily
evident to both, that he (<font color='blue'><b>Robert</b></font>) had entirely supplanted his (<font color='blue'><b>Robert</b></font>) brother. He (<font color='blue'><b>Robert</b></font>) was
proud of his (<font color='blue'><b>Robert</b></font>) conquest, proud of tricking Edward, and very proud of
marrying privately without his (<font color='blue'><b>Robert</b></font>) mother's consent. What immediately
followed is known. They passed some months in great happiness at
Dawlish; for she (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) had many relations and old acquaintances to cut--and
he (<font color='blue'><b>Robert</b></font>) drew several plans for magnificent cottages;--and from thence
returning to town, procured the forgiveness of Mrs. Ferrars, by the
simple expedient of asking it, which, at Lucy's instigation, was
adopted. The forgiveness, at first, indeed, as was reasonable,
comprehended only Robert; and Lucy, who had owed his (<font color='blue'><b>Robert</b></font>) mother no duty and
therefore could have transgressed none, still remained some weeks
longer unpardoned. But perseverance in humility of conduct and
messages, in self-condemnation for Robert's offence, and gratitude for
the unkindness she (<font color='blue'><b>Lucy</b></font>) was treated with, procured her (<font color='blue'><b>Lucy</b></font>) in time the haughty
notice which overcame her (<font color='blue'><b>Lucy</b></font>) by its graciousness, and led soon afterwards,
by rapid degrees, to the highest state of affection and influence.
Lucy became as necessary to Mrs. Ferrars, as either Robert or Fanny;
and while Edward was never cordially forgiven for having once intended
to marry her (<font color='blue'><b>Fanny</b></font>), and Elinor, though superior to her (<font color='blue'><b>Elinor</b></font>) in fortune and birth,
was spoken of as an intruder, SHE was in every thing considered, and
always openly acknowledged, to be a favourite child. They settled in
town, received very liberal assistance from Mrs. Ferrars, were on the
best terms imaginable with the Dashwoods; and setting aside the
jealousies and ill-will continually subsisting between Fanny and Lucy,
in which their husbands of course took a part, as well as the frequent
domestic disagreements between Robert and Lucy themselves, nothing
could exceed the harmony in which they all lived together.

<p/>Elinor's marriage divided her (<font color='blue'><b>Elinor</b></font>) as little from her (<font color='blue'><b>Elinor</b></font>) family as could well
be contrived, without rendering the cottage at Barton entirely useless,
for her (<font color='blue'><b>Elinor</b></font>) mother and sisters spent much more than half their time with
her (<font color='blue'><b>Elinor</b></font>). Mrs. Dashwood was acting on motives of policy as well as pleasure
in the frequency of her (<font color='blue'><b>Dashwood</b></font>) visits at Delaford; for her (<font color='blue'><b>Dashwood</b></font>) wish of bringing
Marianne and Colonel Brandon together was hardly less earnest, though
rather more liberal than what John had expressed. It was now her (<font color='blue'><b>John</b></font>)
darling object. Precious as was the company of her (<font color='blue'><b>John</b></font>) daughter to her (<font color='blue'><b>John</b></font>),
she (<font color='blue'><b>John</b></font>) desired nothing so much as to give up its constant enjoyment to her (<font color='blue'><b>John</b></font>)
valued friend; and to see Marianne settled at the mansion-house was
equally the wish of Edward and Elinor. They each felt his (<font color='blue'><b>Edward</b></font>) sorrows, and
their own obligations, and Marianne, by general consent, was to be the
reward of all.

<p/>Between Barton and Delaford, there was that constant communication
which strong family affection would naturally dictate;--and among the
merits and the happiness of Elinor and Marianne, let it not be ranked
as the least considerable, that though sisters, and living almost
within sight of each other, they could live without disagreement
between themselves, or producing coolness between their husbands.
