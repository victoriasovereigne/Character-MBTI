<p/>By Jane Austen



<p/>Chapter 1


<p/>It is a truth universally acknowledged, that a single man in possession
of a good fortune, must be in want of a wife.

<p/>However little known the feelings or views of such a man may be on his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>)
first entering a neighbourhood, this truth is so well fixed in the minds
of the surrounding families, that he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) is considered the rightful property
of some one or other of their daughters.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``My dear Mr. Bennet,''  (<font color='red'><b>lady</b></font>)</div>said his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) lady to him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) one day, <div class="bookquote">``have you heard that
Netherfield Park is let at last?''

 (<font color='red'><b>him</b></font>)</div><p/>Mr. Bennet replied that he (<font color='blue'><b>Bennet</b></font>) had not.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``But it is,''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>returned she (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>); <div class="bookquote">``for Mrs. Long has just been here, and she (<font color='blue'><b>Long</b></font>)
told me all about it.''

 (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div><p/>Mr. Bennet made no answer.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Do you not want to know who has taken it?''  (<font color='red'><b>wife</b></font>)</div>cried his (<font color='blue'><b>Bennet</b></font>) wife impatiently.

<p/><div class="bookquote">''_You_ want to tell me, and I have no objection to hearing it.''

 (<font color='red'><b>wife</b></font>)</div><p/>This was invitation enough.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Why, my dear, you must know, Mrs. Long says that Netherfield is taken
by a young man of large fortune from the north of England; that he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) came
down on Monday in a chaise and four to see the place, and was so much
delighted with it, that he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) agreed with Mr. Morris immediately; that he (<font color='blue'><b>Mr.</b></font>)
is to take possession before Michaelmas, and some of his (<font color='blue'><b>Mr.</b></font>) servants are to
be in the house by the end of next week.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``What is his (<font color='blue'><b>Mr.</b></font>) name?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Bingley.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Is he (<font color='blue'><b>Mr.</b></font>) married or single?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Oh! Single, my dear, to be sure! A single man of large fortune; four or
five thousand a year. What a fine thing for our girls!''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``How so? How can it affect them?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``My dear Mr. Bennet,''  (<font color='red'><b>wife</b></font>)</div>replied his (<font color='blue'><b>Bennet</b></font>) wife, <div class="bookquote">``how can you be so tiresome! You
must know that I am thinking of his (<font color='blue'><b>Bennet</b></font>) marrying one of them.''

 (<font color='red'><b>wife</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Is that his (<font color='blue'><b>Bennet</b></font>) design in settling here?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Design! Nonsense, how can you talk so! But it is very likely that he (<font color='blue'><b>Bennet</b></font>)
_may_ fall in love with one of them, and therefore you must visit him (<font color='blue'><b>Bennet</b></font>) as
soon as he (<font color='blue'><b>Bennet</b></font>) comes.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I see no occasion for that. You and the girls may go, or you may send
them by themselves, which perhaps will be still better, for as you are
as handsome as any of them, Mr. Bingley may like you the best of the
party.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``My dear, you flatter me. I certainly _have_ had my share of beauty, but
I do not pretend to be anything extraordinary now. When a woman has five
grown-up daughters, she (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) ought to give over thinking of her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) own beauty.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``In such cases, a woman has not often much beauty to think of.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``But, my dear, you must indeed go and see Mr. Bingley when he (<font color='blue'><b>Bingley</b></font>) comes into
the neighbourhood.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``It is more than I engage for, I assure you.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``But consider your daughters. Only think what an establishment it would
be for one of them. Sir William and Lady Lucas are determined to
go, merely on that account, for in general, you know, they visit no
newcomers. Indeed you must go, for it will be impossible for _us_ to
visit him (<font color='blue'><b>William</b></font>) if you do not.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``You are over-scrupulous, surely. I dare say Mr. Bingley will be very
glad to see you; and I will send a few lines by you to assure him (<font color='blue'><b>Bingley</b></font>) of my
hearty consent to his (<font color='blue'><b>Bingley</b></font>) marrying whichever he (<font color='blue'><b>Bingley</b></font>) chooses of the girls; though
I must throw in a good word for my little Lizzy.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I desire you will do no such thing. Lizzy is not a bit better than the
others; and I am sure she (<font color='blue'><b>Lizzy</b></font>) is not half so handsome as Jane, nor half so
good-humoured as Lydia. But you are always giving _her (<font color='blue'><b>Lydia</b></font>)_ the preference.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``They have none of them much to recommend them,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>replied he (<font color='blue'><b>Bennet</b></font>); <div class="bookquote">``they are
all silly and ignorant like other girls; but Lizzy has something more of
quickness than her (<font color='blue'><b>Lizzy</b></font>) sisters.''

 (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Mr. Bennet, how _can_ you abuse your own children in such a way? You
take delight in vexing me. You have no compassion for my poor nerves.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``You mistake me, my dear. I have a high respect for your nerves. They
are my old friends. I have heard you mention them with consideration
these last twenty years at least.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Ah, you do not know what I suffer.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``But I hope you will get over it, and live to see many young men of four
thousand a year come into the neighbourhood.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``It will be no use to us, if twenty such should come, since you will not
visit them.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Depend upon it, my dear, that when there are twenty, I will visit them
all.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Bennet</b></font>)</div><p/>Mr. Bennet was so odd a mixture of quick parts, sarcastic humour,
reserve, and caprice, that the experience of three-and-twenty years had
been insufficient to make his (<font color='blue'><b>Bennet</b></font>) wife understand his (<font color='blue'><b>Bennet</b></font>) character. _Her (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>)_ mind
was less difficult to develop. She (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>) was a woman of mean understanding,
little information, and uncertain temper. When she (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>) was discontented,
she (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>) fancied herself nervous. The business of her (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>) life was to get her (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>)
daughters married; its solace was visiting and news.



<p/>Chapter 2


<p/>Mr. Bennet was among the earliest of those who waited on Mr. Bingley. He (<font color='blue'><b>Bingley</b></font>)
had always intended to visit him (<font color='blue'><b>Bingley</b></font>), though to the last always assuring
his (<font color='blue'><b>Bingley</b></font>) wife that he (<font color='blue'><b>Bingley</b></font>) should not go; and till the evening after the visit was
paid she (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>) had no knowledge of it. It was then disclosed in the following
manner. Observing his (<font color='blue'><b>Bingley</b></font>) second daughter employed in trimming a hat, he (<font color='blue'><b>Bingley</b></font>)
suddenly addressed her (<font color='blue'><b>daughter</b></font>) with:

<p/><div class="bookquote">``I hope Mr. Bingley will like it, Lizzy.''

 (<font color='red'><b>her</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``We are not in a way to know _what_ Mr. Bingley likes,''  (<font color='red'><b>mother</b></font>)</div>said her (<font color='blue'><b>daughter</b></font>) mother
resentfully, <div class="bookquote">``since we are not to visit.''

 (<font color='red'><b>mother</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``But you forget, mamma,''  (<font color='red'><b>Elizabeth/Miss Bennet/Miss Elizabeth</b></font>)</div>said Elizabeth, <div class="bookquote">``that we shall meet him (<font color='blue'><b>Bingley</b></font>) at the
assemblies, and that Mrs. Long promised to introduce him (<font color='blue'><b>Bingley</b></font>).''

 (<font color='red'><b>Elizabeth/Miss Bennet/Miss Elizabeth</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I do not believe Mrs. Long will do any such thing. She (<font color='blue'><b>Long</b></font>) has two nieces
of her (<font color='blue'><b>Long</b></font>) own. She (<font color='blue'><b>Long</b></font>) is a selfish, hypocritical woman, and I have no opinion
of her (<font color='blue'><b>Long</b></font>).''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``No more have I,''  (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Bennet</b></font>)</div>said Mr. Bennet; <div class="bookquote">``and I am glad to find that you do
not depend on her (<font color='blue'><b>Long</b></font>) serving you.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Bennet</b></font>)</div><p/>Mrs. Bennet deigned not to make any reply, but, unable to contain
herself, began scolding one of her (<font color='blue'><b>Bennet</b></font>) daughters.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Don't keep coughing so, Kitty, for Heaven's sake! Have a little
compassion on my nerves. You tear them to pieces.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Kitty has no discretion in her (<font color='blue'><b>Kitty</b></font>) coughs,''  (<font color='red'><b>father</b></font>)</div>said her (<font color='blue'><b>Bennet</b></font>) father; <div class="bookquote">``she (<font color='blue'><b>Kitty</b></font>) times
them ill.''

 (<font color='red'><b>father</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I do not cough for my own amusement,''  (<font color='red'><b>Kitty</b></font>)</div>replied Kitty fretfully. <div class="bookquote">``When is
your next ball to be, Lizzy?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``To-morrow fortnight.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Aye, so it is,''  (<font color='red'><b>mother</b></font>)</div>cried her (<font color='blue'><b>Bennet</b></font>) mother, <div class="bookquote">``and Mrs. Long does not come back
till the day before; so it will be impossible for her (<font color='blue'><b>Long</b></font>) to introduce him (<font color='blue'><b>Long</b></font>),
for she (<font color='blue'><b>Long</b></font>) will not know him (<font color='blue'><b>Long</b></font>) herself.''

 (<font color='red'><b>mother</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Then, my dear, you may have the advantage of your friend, and introduce
Mr. Bingley to _her (<font color='blue'><b>Long</b></font>)_.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Impossible, Mr. Bennet, impossible, when I am not acquainted with him (<font color='blue'><b>Bennet</b></font>)
myself; how can you be so teasing?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I honour your circumspection. A fortnight's acquaintance is certainly
very little. One cannot know what a man really is by the end of a
fortnight. But if _we_ do not venture somebody else will; and after all,
Mrs. Long and her (<font color='blue'><b>Long</b></font>) neices must stand their chance; and, therefore, as
she (<font color='blue'><b>Long</b></font>) will think it an act of kindness, if you decline the office, I will
take it on myself.''

 (<font color='red'><b>The girls</b></font>)</div><p/>The girls stared at their father. Mrs. Bennet said only, <div class="bookquote">``Nonsense,
nonsense!''

 (<font color='red'><b>Mrs. Bennet</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``What can be the meaning of that emphatic exclamation?''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>cried he (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>). <div class="bookquote">``Do
you consider the forms of introduction, and the stress that is laid on
them, as nonsense? I cannot quite agree with you _there_. What say you,
Mary? For you are a young lady of deep reflection, I know, and read
great books and make extracts.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Mary/Mary King</b></font>)</div><p/>Mary wished to say something sensible, but knew not how.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``While Mary is adjusting her (<font color='blue'><b>Mary</b></font>) ideas,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) continued, <div class="bookquote">``let us return to Mr.
Bingley.''

 (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I am sick of Mr. Bingley,''  (<font color='red'><b>wife</b></font>)</div>cried his (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) wife.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``I am sorry to hear _that_; but why did not you tell me that before? If
I had known as much this morning I certainly would not have called
on him (<font color='blue'><b>Bingley</b></font>). It is very unlucky; but as I have actually paid the visit, we
cannot escape the acquaintance now.''

 (<font color='red'><b>the ladies</b></font>)</div><p/>The astonishment of the ladies was just what he (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) wished; that of Mrs.
Bennet perhaps surpassing the rest; though, when the first tumult of joy
was over, she (<font color='blue'><b>Bennet</b></font>) began to declare that it was what she (<font color='blue'><b>Bennet</b></font>) had expected all the
while.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``How good it was in you, my dear Mr. Bennet! But I knew I should
persuade you at last. I was sure you loved your girls too well to
neglect such an acquaintance. Well, how pleased I am! and it is such a
good joke, too, that you should have gone this morning and never said a
word about it till now.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Now, Kitty, you may cough as much as you choose,''  (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Bennet</b></font>)</div>said Mr. Bennet; and,
as he (<font color='blue'><b>Bennet</b></font>) spoke, he (<font color='blue'><b>Bennet</b></font>) left the room, fatigued with the raptures of his (<font color='blue'><b>Bennet</b></font>) wife.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``What an excellent father you have, girls!''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>said she (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>), when the door was
shut. <div class="bookquote">``I do not know how you will ever make him (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) amends for his (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) kindness;
or me, either, for that matter. At our time of life it is not so
pleasant, I can tell you, to be making new acquaintances every day; but
for your sakes, we would do anything. Lydia, my love, though you _are_
the youngest, I dare say Mr. Bingley will dance with you at the next
ball.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Oh!''  (<font color='red'><b>Lydia/Miss Lydia/Miss Lydia Bennet</b></font>)</div>said Lydia stoutly, <div class="bookquote">``I am not afraid; for though I _am_ the
youngest, I'm the tallest.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Lydia/Miss Lydia/Miss Lydia Bennet</b></font>)</div><p/>The rest of the evening was spent in conjecturing how soon he (<font color='blue'><b>Bennet</b></font>) would
return Mr. Bennet's visit, and determining when they should ask him (<font color='blue'><b>Bennet</b></font>) to
dinner.



<p/>Chapter 3


<p/>Not all that Mrs. Bennet, however, with the assistance of her (<font color='blue'><b>Bennet</b></font>) five
daughters, could ask on the subject, was sufficient to draw from her (<font color='blue'><b>Bennet</b></font>)
husband any satisfactory description of Mr. Bingley. They attacked him (<font color='blue'><b>Bingley</b></font>)
in various ways--with barefaced questions, ingenious suppositions, and
distant surmises; but he (<font color='blue'><b>Bingley</b></font>) eluded the skill of them all, and they were at
last obliged to accept the second-hand intelligence of their neighbour,
Lady Lucas. Her (<font color='blue'><b>Lucas</b></font>) report was highly favourable. Sir William had been
delighted with him (<font color='blue'><b>William</b></font>). He (<font color='blue'><b>William</b></font>) was quite young, wonderfully handsome, extremely
agreeable, and, to crown the whole, he (<font color='blue'><b>William</b></font>) meant to be at the next assembly
with a large party. Nothing could be more delightful! To be fond of
dancing was a certain step towards falling in love; and very lively
hopes of Mr. Bingley's heart were entertained.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``If I can but see one of my daughters happily settled at Netherfield,''
 (<font color='red'><b>Mrs. Bennet</b></font>)</div>said Mrs. Bennet to her (<font color='blue'><b>Bennet</b></font>) husband, <div class="bookquote">``and all the others equally well
married, I shall have nothing to wish for.''

 (<font color='red'><b>husband</b></font>)</div><p/>In a few days Mr. Bingley returned Mr. Bennet's visit, and sat about
ten minutes with him (<font color='blue'><b>Bingley</b></font>) in his (<font color='blue'><b>Bingley</b></font>) library. He (<font color='blue'><b>Bingley</b></font>) had entertained hopes of being
admitted to a sight of the young ladies, of whose beauty he (<font color='blue'><b>Bingley</b></font>) had
heard much; but he (<font color='blue'><b>Bingley</b></font>) saw only the father. The ladies were somewhat more
fortunate, for they had the advantage of ascertaining from an upper
window that he (<font color='blue'><b>Bingley</b></font>) wore a blue coat, and rode a black horse.

<p/>An invitation to dinner was soon afterwards dispatched; and already
had Mrs. Bennet planned the courses that were to do credit to her (<font color='blue'><b>Bennet</b></font>)
housekeeping, when an answer arrived which deferred it all. Mr. Bingley
was obliged to be in town the following day, and, consequently, unable
to accept the honour of their invitation, etc.. Mrs. Bennet was quite
disconcerted. She (<font color='blue'><b>Bennet</b></font>) could not imagine what business he (<font color='blue'><b>Bingley</b></font>) could have in town
so soon after his (<font color='blue'><b>Bingley</b></font>) arrival in Hertfordshire; and she (<font color='blue'><b>Bennet</b></font>) began to fear that
he (<font color='blue'><b>Bingley</b></font>) might be always flying about from one place to another, and never
settled at Netherfield as he (<font color='blue'><b>Bingley</b></font>) ought to be. Lady Lucas quieted her (<font color='blue'><b>Lucas</b></font>) fears
a little by starting the idea of his (<font color='blue'><b>Bingley</b></font>) being gone to London only to get
a large party for the ball; and a report soon followed that Mr. Bingley
was to bring twelve ladies and seven gentlemen with him (<font color='blue'><b>Bingley</b></font>) to the assembly.
The girls grieved over such a number of ladies, but were comforted the
day before the ball by hearing, that instead of twelve he (<font color='blue'><b>Bingley</b></font>) brought only
six with him (<font color='blue'><b>Bingley</b></font>) from London--his (<font color='blue'><b>Bingley</b></font>) five sisters and a cousin. And when
the party entered the assembly room it consisted of only five
altogether--Mr. Bingley, his (<font color='blue'><b>Bingley</b></font>) two sisters, the husband of the eldest, and
another young man.

<p/>Mr. Bingley was good-looking and gentlemanlike; he (<font color='blue'><b>Bingley</b></font>) had a pleasant
countenance, and easy, unaffected manners. His (<font color='blue'><b>Bingley</b></font>) sisters were fine women,
with an air of decided fashion. His (<font color='blue'><b>Bingley</b></font>) brother-in-law, Mr. Hurst, merely
looked the gentleman; but his (<font color='blue'><b>Bingley</b></font>) friend Mr. Darcy soon drew the attention
of the room by his (<font color='blue'><b>Darcy</b></font>) fine, tall person, handsome features, noble mien, and
the report which was in general circulation within five minutes
after his (<font color='blue'><b>Darcy</b></font>) entrance, of his (<font color='blue'><b>Darcy</b></font>) having ten thousand a year. The gentlemen
pronounced him (<font color='blue'><b>Darcy</b></font>) to be a fine figure of a man, the ladies declared he (<font color='blue'><b>Darcy</b></font>)
was much handsomer than Mr. Bingley, and he (<font color='blue'><b>Bingley</b></font>) was looked at with great
admiration for about half the evening, till his (<font color='blue'><b>Bingley</b></font>) manners gave a disgust
which turned the tide of his (<font color='blue'><b>Bingley</b></font>) popularity; for he (<font color='blue'><b>Bingley</b></font>) was discovered to be
proud; to be above his (<font color='blue'><b>Bingley</b></font>) company, and above being pleased; and not all
his (<font color='blue'><b>Bingley</b></font>) large estate in Derbyshire could then save him (<font color='blue'><b>Bingley</b></font>) from having a most
forbidding, disagreeable countenance, and being unworthy to be compared
with his (<font color='blue'><b>Bingley</b></font>) friend.

<p/>Mr. Bingley had soon made himself acquainted with all the principal
people in the room; he (<font color='blue'><b>Bingley</b></font>) was lively and unreserved, danced every dance,
was angry that the ball closed so early, and talked of giving
one himself at Netherfield. Such amiable qualities must speak for
themselves. What a contrast between him (<font color='blue'><b>Bingley</b></font>) and his (<font color='blue'><b>Bingley</b></font>) friend! Mr. Darcy danced
only once with Mrs. Hurst and once with Miss Bingley, declined being
introduced to any other lady, and spent the rest of the evening in
walking about the room, speaking occasionally to one of his (<font color='blue'><b>Darcy</b></font>) own party.
His (<font color='blue'><b>Darcy</b></font>) character was decided. He (<font color='blue'><b>Darcy</b></font>) was the proudest, most disagreeable man
in the world, and everybody hoped that he (<font color='blue'><b>Darcy</b></font>) would never come there again.
Amongst the most violent against him (<font color='blue'><b>Darcy</b></font>) was Mrs. Bennet, whose dislike of
his (<font color='blue'><b>Darcy</b></font>) general behaviour was sharpened into particular resentment by his (<font color='blue'><b>Darcy</b></font>)
having slighted one of her (<font color='blue'><b>Bennet</b></font>) daughters.

<p/>Elizabeth Bennet had been obliged, by the scarcity of gentlemen, to sit
down for two dances; and during part of that time, Mr. Darcy had been
standing near enough for her (<font color='blue'><b>Bennet</b></font>) to hear a conversation between him (<font color='blue'><b>Darcy</b></font>) and Mr.
Bingley, who came from the dance for a few minutes, to press his (<font color='blue'><b>Bingley</b></font>) friend
to join it.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Come, Darcy,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>said he (<font color='blue'><b>Bingley</b></font>), <div class="bookquote">``I must have you dance. I hate to see you
standing about by yourself in this stupid manner. You had much better
dance.''

 (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I certainly shall not. You know how I detest it, unless I am
particularly acquainted with my partner. At such an assembly as this
it would be insupportable. Your sisters are engaged, and there is not
another woman in the room whom it would not be a punishment to me to
stand up with.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I would not be so fastidious as you are,''  (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Bingley/Bingley</b></font>)</div>cried Mr. Bingley, <div class="bookquote">``for a
kingdom! Upon my honour, I never met with so many pleasant girls in
my life as I have this evening; and there are several of them you see
uncommonly pretty.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Bingley/Bingley</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">''_You_ are dancing with the only handsome girl in the room,''  (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Darcy/Darcy</b></font>)</div>said Mr.
Darcy, looking at the eldest Miss Bennet.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Oh! She (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) is the most beautiful creature I ever beheld! But there is one
of her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) sisters sitting down just behind you, who is very pretty, and I
dare say very agreeable. Do let me ask my partner to introduce you.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Which do you mean?''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>and turning round he (<font color='blue'><b>Darcy</b></font>) looked for a moment at
Elizabeth, till catching her (<font color='blue'><b>Elizabeth</b></font>) eye, he (<font color='blue'><b>Darcy</b></font>) withdrew his (<font color='blue'><b>Darcy</b></font>) own and coldly said:
<div class="bookquote">``She (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) is tolerable, but not handsome enough to tempt _me_; I am in no
humour at present to give consequence to young ladies who are slighted
by other men. You had better return to your partner and enjoy her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>)
smiles, for you are wasting your time with me.''

 (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div><p/>Mr. Bingley followed his (<font color='blue'><b>Bingley</b></font>) advice. Mr. Darcy walked off; and Elizabeth
remained with no very cordial feelings toward him (<font color='blue'><b>Darcy</b></font>). She (<font color='blue'><b>Elizabeth</b></font>) told the story,
however, with great spirit among her (<font color='blue'><b>Elizabeth</b></font>) friends; for she (<font color='blue'><b>Elizabeth</b></font>) had a lively,
playful disposition, which delighted in anything ridiculous.

<p/>The evening altogether passed off pleasantly to the whole family. Mrs.
Bennet had seen her (<font color='blue'><b>Bennet</b></font>) eldest daughter much admired by the Netherfield
party. Mr. Bingley had danced with her (<font color='blue'><b>Bennet</b></font>) twice, and she (<font color='blue'><b>Bennet</b></font>) had been
distinguished by his (<font color='blue'><b>Bingley</b></font>) sisters. Jane was as much gratified by this as
her (<font color='blue'><b>Jane</b></font>) mother could be, though in a quieter way. Elizabeth felt Jane's
pleasure. Mary had heard herself mentioned to Miss Bingley as the most
accomplished girl in the neighbourhood; and Catherine and Lydia had been
fortunate enough never to be without partners, which was all that they
had yet learnt to care for at a ball. They returned, therefore, in good
spirits to Longbourn, the village where they lived, and of which they
were the principal inhabitants. They found Mr. Bennet still up. With
a book he (<font color='blue'><b>Bennet</b></font>) was regardless of time; and on the present occasion he (<font color='blue'><b>Bennet</b></font>) had a
good deal of curiosity as to the event of an evening which had raised
such splendid expectations. He (<font color='blue'><b>Bennet</b></font>) had rather hoped that his (<font color='blue'><b>Bennet</b></font>) wife's views on
the stranger would be disappointed; but he (<font color='blue'><b>Bennet</b></font>) soon found out that he (<font color='blue'><b>Bennet</b></font>) had a
different story to hear.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Oh! my dear Mr. Bennet,''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>as she (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>) entered the room, <div class="bookquote">``we have had a most
delightful evening, a most excellent ball. I wish you had been there.
Jane was so admired, nothing could be like it. Everybody said how well
she (<font color='blue'><b>Jane</b></font>) looked; and Mr. Bingley thought her (<font color='blue'><b>Jane</b></font>) quite beautiful, and danced with
her (<font color='blue'><b>Jane</b></font>) twice! Only think of _that_, my dear; he (<font color='blue'><b>Bingley</b></font>) actually danced with her (<font color='blue'><b>Jane</b></font>)
twice! and she (<font color='blue'><b>Jane</b></font>) was the only creature in the room that he (<font color='blue'><b>Bingley</b></font>) asked a second
time. First of all, he (<font color='blue'><b>Bingley</b></font>) asked Miss Lucas. I was so vexed to see him (<font color='blue'><b>Bingley</b></font>) stand
up with her (<font color='blue'><b>Lucas</b></font>)! But, however, he (<font color='blue'><b>Bingley</b></font>) did not admire her (<font color='blue'><b>Lucas</b></font>) at all; indeed, nobody
can, you know; and he (<font color='blue'><b>Bingley</b></font>) seemed quite struck with Jane as she (<font color='blue'><b>Jane</b></font>) was going
down the dance. So he (<font color='blue'><b>Bingley</b></font>) inquired who she (<font color='blue'><b>Jane</b></font>) was, and got introduced, and
asked her (<font color='blue'><b>Jane</b></font>) for the two next. Then the two third he (<font color='blue'><b>Bingley</b></font>) danced with Miss King,
and the two fourth with Maria Lucas, and the two fifth with Jane again,
and the two sixth with Lizzy, and the _Boulanger_--''

 (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``If he (<font color='blue'><b>Bingley</b></font>) had had any compassion for _me_,''  (<font color='red'><b>husband</b></font>)</div>cried her (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>) husband impatiently,
<div class="bookquote">``he (<font color='blue'><b>Bingley</b></font>) would not have danced half so much! For God's sake, say no more of
his (<font color='blue'><b>God</b></font>) partners. Oh that he (<font color='blue'><b>God</b></font>) had sprained his (<font color='blue'><b>God</b></font>) ankle in the first dance!''

 (<font color='red'><b>husband</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Oh! my dear, I am quite delighted with him (<font color='blue'><b>God</b></font>). He (<font color='blue'><b>God</b></font>) is so excessively
handsome! And his (<font color='blue'><b>God</b></font>) sisters are charming women. I never in my life saw
anything more elegant than their dresses. I dare say the lace upon Mrs.
Hurst's gown--''

 (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div><p/>Here she (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>) was interrupted again. Mr. Bennet protested against any
description of finery. She (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>) was therefore obliged to seek another branch
of the subject, and related, with much bitterness of spirit and some
exaggeration, the shocking rudeness of Mr. Darcy.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``But I can assure you,''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>) added, <div class="bookquote">``that Lizzy does not lose much by not
suiting _his (<font color='blue'><b>God</b></font>)_ fancy; for he (<font color='blue'><b>God</b></font>) is a most disagreeable, horrid man, not at
all worth pleasing. So high and so conceited that there was no enduring
him (<font color='blue'><b>God</b></font>)! He (<font color='blue'><b>God</b></font>) walked here, and he (<font color='blue'><b>God</b></font>) walked there, fancying himself so very
great! Not handsome enough to dance with! I wish you had been there, my
dear, to have given him (<font color='blue'><b>God</b></font>) one of your set-downs. I quite detest the man.''



 (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div><p/>Chapter 4


<p/>When Jane and Elizabeth were alone, the former, who had been cautious in
her (<font color='blue'><b>Jane</b></font>) praise of Mr. Bingley before, expressed to her (<font color='blue'><b>Jane</b></font>) sister just how very
much she (<font color='blue'><b>Jane</b></font>) admired him (<font color='blue'><b>Bingley</b></font>).

<p/><div class="bookquote">``He (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) is just what a young man ought to be,''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>said she (<font color='blue'><b>Jane</b></font>), <div class="bookquote">``sensible,
good-humoured, lively; and I never saw such happy manners!--so much
ease, with such perfect good breeding!''

 (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``He (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) is also handsome,''  (<font color='red'><b>Elizabeth/Miss Bennet/Miss Elizabeth</b></font>)</div>replied Elizabeth, <div class="bookquote">``which a young man ought
likewise to be, if he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) possibly can. His (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) character is thereby complete.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Elizabeth/Miss Bennet/Miss Elizabeth</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I was very much flattered by his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) asking me to dance a second time. I
did not expect such a compliment.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Did not you? I did for you. But that is one great difference between
us. Compliments always take _you_ by surprise, and _me_ never. What
could be more natural than his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) asking you again? He (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) could not help
seeing that you were about five times as pretty as every other woman
in the room. No thanks to his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) gallantry for that. Well, he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) certainly is
very agreeable, and I give you leave to like him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>). You have liked many a
stupider person.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Dear Lizzy!''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Oh! you are a great deal too apt, you know, to like people in general.
You never see a fault in anybody. All the world are good and agreeable
in your eyes. I never heard you speak ill of a human being in your
life.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I would not wish to be hasty in censuring anyone; but I always speak
what I think.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I know you do; and it is _that_ which makes the wonder. With _your_
good sense, to be so honestly blind to the follies and nonsense of
others! Affectation of candour is common enough--one meets with it
everywhere. But to be candid without ostentation or design--to take the
good of everybody's character and make it still better, and say nothing
of the bad--belongs to you alone. And so you like this man's sisters,
too, do you? Their manners are not equal to his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>).''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Certainly not--at first. But they are very pleasing women when you
converse with them. Miss Bingley is to live with her (<font color='blue'><b>Bingley</b></font>) brother, and keep
his (<font color='blue'><b>brother</b></font>) house; and I am much mistaken if we shall not find a very charming
neighbour in her (<font color='blue'><b>Bingley</b></font>).''

 (<font color='red'><b>Elizabeth/Miss Bennet/Miss Elizabeth</b></font>)</div><p/>Elizabeth listened in silence, but was not convinced; their behaviour at
the assembly had not been calculated to please in general; and with more
quickness of observation and less pliancy of temper than her (<font color='blue'><b>Elizabeth</b></font>) sister,
and with a judgement too unassailed by any attention to herself, she (<font color='blue'><b>Elizabeth</b></font>)
was very little disposed to approve them. They were in fact very fine
ladies; not deficient in good humour when they were pleased, nor in the
power of making themselves agreeable when they chose it, but proud and
conceited. They were rather handsome, had been educated in one of the
first private seminaries in town, had a fortune of twenty thousand
pounds, were in the habit of spending more than they ought, and of
associating with people of rank, and were therefore in every respect
entitled to think well of themselves, and meanly of others. They were of
a respectable family in the north of England; a circumstance more deeply
impressed on their memories than that their brother's fortune and their
own had been acquired by trade.

<p/>Mr. Bingley inherited property to the amount of nearly a hundred
thousand pounds from his (<font color='blue'><b>Bingley</b></font>) father, who had intended to purchase an
estate, but did not live to do it. Mr. Bingley intended it likewise, and
sometimes made choice of his (<font color='blue'><b>Bingley</b></font>) county; but as he (<font color='blue'><b>Bingley</b></font>) was now provided with a
good house and the liberty of a manor, it was doubtful to many of those
who best knew the easiness of his (<font color='blue'><b>Bingley</b></font>) temper, whether he (<font color='blue'><b>Bingley</b></font>) might not spend the
remainder of his (<font color='blue'><b>Bingley</b></font>) days at Netherfield, and leave the next generation to
purchase.

<p/>His (<font color='blue'><b>Bingley</b></font>) sisters were anxious for his (<font color='blue'><b>Bingley</b></font>) having an estate of his (<font color='blue'><b>Bingley</b></font>) own; but,
though he (<font color='blue'><b>Bingley</b></font>) was now only established as a tenant, Miss Bingley was by no
means unwilling to preside at his (<font color='blue'><b>Bingley</b></font>) table--nor was Mrs. Hurst, who had
married a man of more fashion than fortune, less disposed to consider
his (<font color='blue'><b>Bingley</b></font>) house as her (<font color='blue'><b>Hurst</b></font>) home when it suited her (<font color='blue'><b>Hurst</b></font>). Mr. Bingley had not been of
age two years, when he (<font color='blue'><b>Bingley</b></font>) was tempted by an accidental recommendation
to look at Netherfield House. He (<font color='blue'><b>Bingley</b></font>) did look at it, and into it for
half-an-hour--was pleased with the situation and the principal
rooms, satisfied with what the owner said in its praise, and took it
immediately.

<p/>Between him (<font color='blue'><b>owner</b></font>) and Darcy there was a very steady friendship, in spite of
great opposition of character. Bingley was endeared to Darcy by the
easiness, openness, and ductility of his (<font color='blue'><b>Bingley</b></font>) temper, though no disposition
could offer a greater contrast to his (<font color='blue'><b>Bingley</b></font>) own, and though with his (<font color='blue'><b>Bingley</b></font>) own he (<font color='blue'><b>Bingley</b></font>)
never appeared dissatisfied. On the strength of Darcy's regard, Bingley
had the firmest reliance, and of his (<font color='blue'><b>Bingley</b></font>) judgement the highest opinion.
In understanding, Darcy was the superior. Bingley was by no means
deficient, but Darcy was clever. He (<font color='blue'><b>Bingley</b></font>) was at the same time haughty,
reserved, and fastidious, and his (<font color='blue'><b>Bingley</b></font>) manners, though well-bred, were not
inviting. In that respect his (<font color='blue'><b>Bingley</b></font>) friend had greatly the advantage. Bingley
was sure of being liked wherever he (<font color='blue'><b>Bingley</b></font>) appeared, Darcy was continually
giving offense.

<p/>The manner in which they spoke of the Meryton assembly was sufficiently
characteristic. Bingley had never met with more pleasant people or
prettier girls in his (<font color='blue'><b>Bingley</b></font>) life; everybody had been most kind and attentive
to him (<font color='blue'><b>Bingley</b></font>); there had been no formality, no stiffness; he (<font color='blue'><b>Bingley</b></font>) had soon felt
acquainted with all the room; and, as to Miss Bennet, he (<font color='blue'><b>Bingley</b></font>) could not
conceive an angel more beautiful. Darcy, on the contrary, had seen a
collection of people in whom there was little beauty and no fashion, for
none of whom he (<font color='blue'><b>Darcy</b></font>) had felt the smallest interest, and from none received
either attention or pleasure. Miss Bennet he (<font color='blue'><b>Darcy</b></font>) acknowledged to be pretty,
but she (<font color='blue'><b>Bennet</b></font>) smiled too much.

<p/>Mrs. Hurst and her (<font color='blue'><b>Hurst</b></font>) sister allowed it to be so--but still they admired
her (<font color='blue'><b>Hurst</b></font>) and liked her (<font color='blue'><b>Hurst</b></font>), and pronounced her (<font color='blue'><b>Hurst</b></font>) to be a sweet girl, and one
whom they would not object to know more of. Miss Bennet was therefore
established as a sweet girl, and their brother felt authorized by such
commendation to think of her (<font color='blue'><b>Bennet</b></font>) as he (<font color='blue'><b>brother</b></font>) chose.



<p/>Chapter 5


<p/>Within a short walk of Longbourn lived a family with whom the Bennets
were particularly intimate. Sir William Lucas had been formerly in trade
in Meryton, where he (<font color='blue'><b>Lucas</b></font>) had made a tolerable fortune, and risen to the
honour of knighthood by an address to the king during his (<font color='blue'><b>king</b></font>) mayoralty.
The distinction had perhaps been felt too strongly. It had given him (<font color='blue'><b>king</b></font>) a
disgust to his (<font color='blue'><b>king</b></font>) business, and to his (<font color='blue'><b>king</b></font>) residence in a small market town;
and, in quitting them both, he (<font color='blue'><b>king</b></font>) had removed with his (<font color='blue'><b>king</b></font>) family to a house
about a mile from Meryton, denominated from that period Lucas Lodge,
where he (<font color='blue'><b>Lodge</b></font>) could think with pleasure of his (<font color='blue'><b>Lodge</b></font>) own importance, and,
unshackled by business, occupy himself solely in being civil to all
the world. For, though elated by his (<font color='blue'><b>Lodge</b></font>) rank, it did not render him (<font color='blue'><b>Lodge</b></font>)
supercilious; on the contrary, he (<font color='blue'><b>Lodge</b></font>) was all attention to everybody. By
nature inoffensive, friendly, and obliging, his (<font color='blue'><b>Lodge</b></font>) presentation at St.
James's had made him (<font color='blue'><b>Lodge</b></font>) courteous.

<p/>Lady Lucas was a very good kind of woman, not too clever to be a
valuable neighbour to Mrs. Bennet. They had several children. The eldest
of them, a sensible, intelligent young woman, about twenty-seven, was
Elizabeth's intimate friend.

<p/>That the Miss Lucases and the Miss Bennets should meet to talk over
a ball was absolutely necessary; and the morning after the assembly
brought the former to Longbourn to hear and to communicate.

<p/><div class="bookquote">''_You_ began the evening well, Charlotte,''  (<font color='red'><b>the Miss Bennets</b></font>)</div>said Mrs. Bennet with civil
self-command to Miss Lucas. <div class="bookquote">''_You_ were Mr. Bingley's first choice.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Miss Lucas</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Yes; but he (<font color='blue'><b>brother</b></font>) seemed to like his (<font color='blue'><b>brother</b></font>) second better.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Oh! you mean Jane, I suppose, because he (<font color='blue'><b>brother</b></font>) danced with her (<font color='blue'><b>Jane</b></font>) twice. To be
sure that _did_ seem as if he (<font color='blue'><b>brother</b></font>) admired her (<font color='blue'><b>Jane</b></font>)--indeed I rather believe he (<font color='blue'><b>brother</b></font>)
_did_--I heard something about it--but I hardly know what--something
about Mr. Robinson.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/>``Perhaps you mean what I overheard between him (<font color='blue'><b>Robinson</b></font>) and Mr. Robinson; did not
I mention it to you? Mr. Robinson's asking him (<font color='blue'><b>Robinson</b></font>) how he (<font color='blue'><b>Robinson</b></font>) liked our Meryton
assemblies, and whether he (<font color='blue'><b>Robinson</b></font>) did not think there were a great many
pretty women in the room, and _which_ he (<font color='blue'><b>Robinson</b></font>) thought the prettiest? and his (<font color='blue'><b>Robinson</b></font>)
answering immediately to the last question: <div class="bookquote">``Oh! the eldest Miss Bennet,
beyond a doubt; there cannot be two opinions on that point.'''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Upon my word! Well, that is very decided indeed--that does seem as
if--but, however, it may all come to nothing, you know.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">''_My_ overhearings were more to the purpose than _yours_, Eliza,''  (<font color='red'><b>Charlotte</b></font>)</div>said
Charlotte. <div class="bookquote">``Mr. Darcy is not so well worth listening to as his (<font color='blue'><b>Darcy</b></font>) friend,
is he (<font color='blue'><b>Darcy</b></font>)?--poor Eliza!--to be only just _tolerable_.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I beg you would not put it into Lizzy's head to be vexed by his (<font color='blue'><b>Darcy</b></font>)
ill-treatment, for he (<font color='blue'><b>Darcy</b></font>) is such a disagreeable man, that it would be quite
a misfortune to be liked by him (<font color='blue'><b>Darcy</b></font>). Mrs. Long told me last night that he (<font color='blue'><b>Darcy</b></font>)
sat close to her (<font color='blue'><b>Long</b></font>) for half-an-hour without once opening his (<font color='blue'><b>Darcy</b></font>) lips.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Are you quite sure, ma'am?--is not there a little mistake?''  (<font color='red'><b>Jane</b></font>)</div>said Jane.
<div class="bookquote">``I certainly saw Mr. Darcy speaking to her (<font color='blue'><b>Long</b></font>).''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Aye--because she (<font color='blue'><b>Long</b></font>) asked him (<font color='blue'><b>Darcy</b></font>) at last how he (<font color='blue'><b>Darcy</b></font>) liked Netherfield, and he (<font color='blue'><b>Darcy</b></font>)
could not help answering her (<font color='blue'><b>Long</b></font>); but she (<font color='blue'><b>Long</b></font>) said he (<font color='blue'><b>Darcy</b></font>) seemed quite angry at
being spoke to.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Miss Bingley told me,''  (<font color='red'><b>Jane</b></font>)</div>said Jane, <div class="bookquote">``that he (<font color='blue'><b>Darcy</b></font>) never speaks much,
unless among his (<font color='blue'><b>Darcy</b></font>) intimate acquaintances. With _them_ he (<font color='blue'><b>Darcy</b></font>) is remarkably
agreeable.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Jane</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I do not believe a word of it, my dear. If he (<font color='blue'><b>Darcy</b></font>) had been so very
agreeable, he (<font color='blue'><b>Darcy</b></font>) would have talked to Mrs. Long. But I can guess how it
was; everybody says that he (<font color='blue'><b>Darcy</b></font>) is eat up with pride, and I dare say he (<font color='blue'><b>Darcy</b></font>) had
heard somehow that Mrs. Long does not keep a carriage, and had come to
the ball in a hack chaise.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I do not mind his (<font color='blue'><b>Darcy</b></font>) not talking to Mrs. Long,''  (<font color='red'><b>Miss Lucas</b></font>)</div>said Miss Lucas, <div class="bookquote">``but I
wish he (<font color='blue'><b>Darcy</b></font>) had danced with Eliza.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Miss Lucas</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Another time, Lizzy,''  (<font color='red'><b>mother</b></font>)</div>said her (<font color='blue'><b>Lucas</b></font>) mother, <div class="bookquote">``I would not dance with _him (<font color='blue'><b>Darcy</b></font>)_,
if I were you.''

 (<font color='red'><b>mother</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I believe, ma'am, I may safely promise you _never_ to dance with him (<font color='blue'><b>Darcy</b></font>).''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``His (<font color='blue'><b>Darcy</b></font>) pride,''  (<font color='red'><b>Miss Lucas</b></font>)</div>said Miss Lucas, <div class="bookquote">``does not offend _me_ so much as pride
often does, because there is an excuse for it. One cannot wonder that so
very fine a young man, with family, fortune, everything in his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) favour,
should think highly of himself. If I may so express it, he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) has a _right_
to be proud.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Miss Lucas</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``That is very true,''  (<font color='red'><b>Elizabeth/Miss Bennet/Miss Elizabeth</b></font>)</div>replied Elizabeth, <div class="bookquote">``and I could easily forgive
_his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>)_ pride, if he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) had not mortified _mine_.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Elizabeth/Miss Bennet/Miss Elizabeth</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Pride,''  (<font color='red'><b>Mary/Mary King</b></font>)</div>observed Mary, who piqued herself upon the solidity of her (<font color='blue'><b>Elizabeth</b></font>)
reflections, <div class="bookquote">``is a very common failing, I believe. By all that I have
ever read, I am convinced that it is very common indeed; that human
nature is particularly prone to it, and that there are very few of us
who do not cherish a feeling of self-complacency on the score of some
quality or other, real or imaginary. Vanity and pride are different
things, though the words are often used synonymously. A person may
be proud without being vain. Pride relates more to our opinion of
ourselves, vanity to what we would have others think of us.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Mary/Mary King</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``If I were as rich as Mr. Darcy,''  (<font color='red'><b>Lady Lucas/Lucas</b></font>)</div>cried a young Lucas, who came with
his (<font color='blue'><b>Bingley</b></font>) sisters, <div class="bookquote">``I should not care how proud I was. I would keep a pack of
foxhounds, and drink a bottle of wine a day.''

 (<font color='red'><b>sisters</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Then you would drink a great deal more than you ought,''  (<font color='red'><b>Mrs. Bennet</b></font>)</div>said Mrs.
Bennet; <div class="bookquote">``and if I were to see you at it, I should take away your bottle
directly.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Mrs. Bennet</b></font>)</div><p/>The boy protested that she (<font color='blue'><b>Bennet</b></font>) should not; she (<font color='blue'><b>Bennet</b></font>) continued to declare that she (<font color='blue'><b>Bennet</b></font>)
would, and the argument ended only with the visit.



<p/>Chapter 6


<p/>The ladies of Longbourn soon waited on those of Netherfield. The visit
was soon returned in due form. Miss Bennet's pleasing manners grew on
the goodwill of Mrs. Hurst and Miss Bingley; and though the mother was
found to be intolerable, and the younger sisters not worth speaking to,
a wish of being better acquainted with _them_ was expressed towards
the two eldest. By Jane, this attention was received with the greatest
pleasure, but Elizabeth still saw superciliousness in their treatment
of everybody, hardly excepting even her (<font color='blue'><b>Elizabeth</b></font>) sister, and could not like them;
though their kindness to Jane, such as it was, had a value as arising in
all probability from the influence of their brother's admiration. It
was generally evident whenever they met, that he (<font color='blue'><b>brother</b></font>) _did_ admire her (<font color='blue'><b>Jane</b></font>) and
to _her (<font color='blue'><b>Jane</b></font>)_ it was equally evident that Jane was yielding to the preference
which she (<font color='blue'><b>Jane</b></font>) had begun to entertain for him (<font color='blue'><b>brother</b></font>) from the first, and was in a
way to be very much in love; but she (<font color='blue'><b>Jane</b></font>) considered with pleasure that it
was not likely to be discovered by the world in general, since Jane
united, with great strength of feeling, a composure of temper and a
uniform cheerfulness of manner which would guard her (<font color='blue'><b>Jane</b></font>) from the suspicions
of the impertinent. She (<font color='blue'><b>Jane</b></font>) mentioned this to her (<font color='blue'><b>Jane</b></font>) friend Miss Lucas.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``It may perhaps be pleasant,''  (<font color='red'><b>Charlotte</b></font>)</div>replied Charlotte, <div class="bookquote">``to be able to impose
on the public in such a case; but it is sometimes a disadvantage to be
so very guarded. If a woman conceals her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) affection with the same skill
from the object of it, she (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) may lose the opportunity of fixing him (<font color='blue'><b>it</b></font>); and
it will then be but poor consolation to believe the world equally in
the dark. There is so much of gratitude or vanity in almost every
attachment, that it is not safe to leave any to itself. We can all
_begin_ freely--a slight preference is natural enough; but there are
very few of us who have heart enough to be really in love without
encouragement. In nine cases out of ten a women had better show _more_
affection than she (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) feels. Bingley likes your sister undoubtedly; but he (<font color='blue'><b>Bingley</b></font>)
may never do more than like her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>), if she (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) does not help him (<font color='blue'><b>Bingley</b></font>) on.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Charlotte</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``But she (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) does help him (<font color='blue'><b>Bingley</b></font>) on, as much as her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) nature will allow. If I can
perceive her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) regard for him (<font color='blue'><b>Bingley</b></font>), he (<font color='blue'><b>Bingley</b></font>) must be a simpleton, indeed, not to
discover it too.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Remember, Eliza, that he (<font color='blue'><b>Bingley</b></font>) does not know Jane's disposition as you do.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``But if a woman is partial to a man, and does not endeavour to conceal
it, he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) must find it out.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Perhaps he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) must, if he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) sees enough of her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>). But, though Bingley and Jane
meet tolerably often, it is never for many hours together; and, as they
always see each other in large mixed parties, it is impossible that
every moment should be employed in conversing together. Jane should
therefore make the most of every half-hour in which she (<font color='blue'><b>Jane</b></font>) can command his (<font color='blue'><b>Bingley</b></font>)
attention. When she (<font color='blue'><b>Jane</b></font>) is secure of him (<font color='blue'><b>Bingley</b></font>), there will be more leisure for
falling in love as much as she (<font color='blue'><b>Jane</b></font>) chooses.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Your plan is a good one,''  (<font color='red'><b>Elizabeth/Miss Bennet/Miss Elizabeth</b></font>)</div>replied Elizabeth, <div class="bookquote">``where nothing is in
question but the desire of being well married, and if I were determined
to get a rich husband, or any husband, I dare say I should adopt it. But
these are not Jane's feelings; she (<font color='blue'><b>Jane</b></font>) is not acting by design. As yet,
she (<font color='blue'><b>Jane</b></font>) cannot even be certain of the degree of her (<font color='blue'><b>Jane</b></font>) own regard nor of its
reasonableness. She (<font color='blue'><b>Jane</b></font>) has known him (<font color='blue'><b>husband</b></font>) only a fortnight. She (<font color='blue'><b>Jane</b></font>) danced four
dances with him (<font color='blue'><b>husband</b></font>) at Meryton; she (<font color='blue'><b>Jane</b></font>) saw him (<font color='blue'><b>husband</b></font>) one morning at his (<font color='blue'><b>husband</b></font>) own house,
and has since dined with him (<font color='blue'><b>husband</b></font>) in company four times. This is not quite
enough to make her (<font color='blue'><b>Jane</b></font>) understand his (<font color='blue'><b>husband</b></font>) character.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Elizabeth/Miss Bennet/Miss Elizabeth</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Not as you represent it. Had she (<font color='blue'><b>Jane</b></font>) merely _dined_ with him (<font color='blue'><b>husband</b></font>), she (<font color='blue'><b>Jane</b></font>) might
only have discovered whether he (<font color='blue'><b>husband</b></font>) had a good appetite; but you must
remember that four evenings have also been spent together--and four
evenings may do a great deal.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Yes; these four evenings have enabled them to ascertain that they
both like Vingt-un better than Commerce; but with respect to any other
leading characteristic, I do not imagine that much has been unfolded.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Well,''  (<font color='red'><b>Charlotte</b></font>)</div>said Charlotte, <div class="bookquote">``I wish Jane success with all my heart; and
if she (<font color='blue'><b>Jane</b></font>) were married to him (<font color='blue'><b>husband</b></font>) to-morrow, I should think she (<font color='blue'><b>Jane</b></font>) had as good a
chance of happiness as if she (<font color='blue'><b>Jane</b></font>) were to be studying his (<font color='blue'><b>husband</b></font>) character for a
twelvemonth. Happiness in marriage is entirely a matter of chance. If
the dispositions of the parties are ever so well known to each other or
ever so similar beforehand, it does not advance their felicity in the
least. They always continue to grow sufficiently unlike afterwards to
have their share of vexation; and it is better to know as little as
possible of the defects of the person with whom you are to pass your
life.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Charlotte</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``You make me laugh, Charlotte; but it is not sound. You know it is not
sound, and that you would never act in this way yourself.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Bingley/Bingley</b></font>)</div><p/>Occupied in observing Mr. Bingley's attentions to her (<font color='blue'><b>Charlotte</b></font>) sister, Elizabeth
was far from suspecting that she (<font color='blue'><b>Elizabeth</b></font>) was herself becoming an object of some
interest in the eyes of his (<font color='blue'><b>Bingley</b></font>) friend. Mr. Darcy had at first scarcely
allowed her (<font color='blue'><b>Elizabeth</b></font>) to be pretty; he (<font color='blue'><b>Darcy</b></font>) had looked at her (<font color='blue'><b>Elizabeth</b></font>) without admiration at the
ball; and when they next met, he (<font color='blue'><b>Darcy</b></font>) looked at her (<font color='blue'><b>Elizabeth</b></font>) only to criticise. But no
sooner had he (<font color='blue'><b>Darcy</b></font>) made it clear to himself and his (<font color='blue'><b>Darcy</b></font>) friends that she (<font color='blue'><b>Elizabeth</b></font>) hardly
had a good feature in her (<font color='blue'><b>Elizabeth</b></font>) face, than he (<font color='blue'><b>Darcy</b></font>) began to find it was rendered
uncommonly intelligent by the beautiful expression of her (<font color='blue'><b>Elizabeth</b></font>) dark eyes. To
this discovery succeeded some others equally mortifying. Though he (<font color='blue'><b>Darcy</b></font>) had
detected with a critical eye more than one failure of perfect symmetry
in her (<font color='blue'><b>Elizabeth</b></font>) form, he (<font color='blue'><b>Darcy</b></font>) was forced to acknowledge her (<font color='blue'><b>Elizabeth</b></font>) figure to be light and
pleasing; and in spite of his (<font color='blue'><b>Darcy</b></font>) asserting that her (<font color='blue'><b>Elizabeth</b></font>) manners were not those
of the fashionable world, he (<font color='blue'><b>Darcy</b></font>) was caught by their easy playfulness. Of
this she (<font color='blue'><b>Elizabeth</b></font>) was perfectly unaware; to her (<font color='blue'><b>Elizabeth</b></font>) he (<font color='blue'><b>Darcy</b></font>) was only the man who made
himself agreeable nowhere, and who had not thought her (<font color='blue'><b>Elizabeth</b></font>) handsome enough
to dance with.

<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Darcy</b></font>) began to wish to know more of her (<font color='blue'><b>Elizabeth</b></font>), and as a step towards conversing
with her (<font color='blue'><b>Elizabeth</b></font>) himself, attended to her (<font color='blue'><b>Elizabeth</b></font>) conversation with others. His (<font color='blue'><b>Darcy</b></font>) doing so
drew her (<font color='blue'><b>Elizabeth</b></font>) notice. It was at Sir William Lucas's, where a large party were
assembled.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``What does Mr. Darcy mean,''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>said she (<font color='blue'><b>Elizabeth</b></font>) to Charlotte, <div class="bookquote">``by listening to my
conversation with Colonel Forster?''

 (<font color='red'><b>Charlotte</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``That is a question which Mr. Darcy only can answer.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``But if he (<font color='blue'><b>Darcy</b></font>) does it any more I shall certainly let him (<font color='blue'><b>Darcy</b></font>) know that I see
what he (<font color='blue'><b>Darcy</b></font>) is about. He (<font color='blue'><b>Darcy</b></font>) has a very satirical eye, and if I do not begin by
being impertinent myself, I shall soon grow afraid of him (<font color='blue'><b>Darcy</b></font>).''

 (<font color='red'><b>Miss Lucas</b></font>)</div><p/>On his (<font color='blue'><b>Lucas</b></font>) approaching them soon afterwards, though without seeming to have
any intention of speaking, Miss Lucas defied her (<font color='blue'><b>Lucas</b></font>) friend to mention such
a subject to him (<font color='blue'><b>Lucas</b></font>); which immediately provoking Elizabeth to do it, she (<font color='blue'><b>Elizabeth</b></font>)
turned to him (<font color='blue'><b>Lucas</b></font>) and said:

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Did you not think, Mr. Darcy, that I expressed myself uncommonly
well just now, when I was teasing Colonel Forster to give us a ball at
Meryton?''

 (<font color='red'><b>him</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``With great energy; but it is always a subject which makes a lady
energetic.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``You are severe on us.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``It will be _her (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>)_ turn soon to be teased,''  (<font color='red'><b>Miss Lucas</b></font>)</div>said Miss Lucas. <div class="bookquote">``I am going
to open the instrument, Eliza, and you know what follows.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``You are a very strange creature by way of a friend!--always wanting me
to play and sing before anybody and everybody! If my vanity had taken
a musical turn, you would have been invaluable; but as it is, I would
really rather not sit down before those who must be in the habit of
hearing the very best performers.''  (<font color='red'><b>Miss Lucas</b></font>)</div>On Miss Lucas's persevering, however,
she (<font color='blue'><b>Lucas</b></font>) added, <div class="bookquote">``Very well, if it must be so, it must.''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>And gravely glancing
at Mr. Darcy, ``There is a fine old saying, which everybody here is of
course familiar with: <div class="bookquote">``Keep your breath to cool your porridge'; and I
shall keep mine to swell my song.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Darcy/Darcy</b></font>)</div><p/>Her (<font color='blue'><b>Lucas</b></font>) performance was pleasing, though by no means capital. After a song
or two, and before she (<font color='blue'><b>Lucas</b></font>) could reply to the entreaties of several that
she (<font color='blue'><b>Lucas</b></font>) would sing again, she (<font color='blue'><b>Lucas</b></font>) was eagerly succeeded at the instrument by her (<font color='blue'><b>Lucas</b></font>)
sister Mary, who having, in consequence of being the only plain one in
the family, worked hard for knowledge and accomplishments, was always
impatient for display.

<p/>Mary had neither genius nor taste; and though vanity had given her (<font color='blue'><b>Mary</b></font>)
application, it had given her (<font color='blue'><b>Mary</b></font>) likewise a pedantic air and conceited
manner, which would have injured a higher degree of excellence than she (<font color='blue'><b>Mary</b></font>)
had reached. Elizabeth, easy and unaffected, had been listened to with
much more pleasure, though not playing half so well; and Mary, at the
end of a long concerto, was glad to purchase praise and gratitude by
Scotch and Irish airs, at the request of her (<font color='blue'><b>Irish</b></font>) younger sisters, who,
with some of the Lucases, and two or three officers, joined eagerly in
dancing at one end of the room.

<p/>Mr. Darcy stood near them in silent indignation at such a mode of
passing the evening, to the exclusion of all conversation, and was too
much engrossed by his (<font color='blue'><b>Darcy</b></font>) thoughts to perceive that Sir William Lucas was
his (<font color='blue'><b>Lucas</b></font>) neighbour, till Sir William thus began:

<p/><div class="bookquote">``What a charming amusement for young people this is, Mr. Darcy! There
is nothing like dancing after all. I consider it as one of the first
refinements of polished society.''

 (<font color='red'><b>William/William Lucas</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Certainly, sir; and it has the advantage also of being in vogue amongst
the less polished societies of the world. Every savage can dance.''

 (<font color='red'><b>William/William Lucas</b></font>)</div><p/>Sir William only smiled. <div class="bookquote">``Your friend performs delightfully,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>William</b></font>)
continued after a pause, on seeing Bingley join the group; <div class="bookquote">``and I doubt
not that you are an adept in the science yourself, Mr. Darcy.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Bingley/Bingley</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``You saw me dance at Meryton, I believe, sir.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Yes, indeed, and received no inconsiderable pleasure from the sight. Do
you often dance at St. James's?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Never, sir.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Do you not think it would be a proper compliment to the place?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``It is a compliment which I never pay to any place if I can avoid it.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``You have a house in town, I conclude?''

 (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Darcy/Darcy</b></font>)</div><p/>Mr. Darcy bowed.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``I had once had some thought of fixing in town myself--for I am fond
of superior society; but I did not feel quite certain that the air of
London would agree with Lady Lucas.''

 (<font color='red'><b>He</b></font>)</div><p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Darcy</b></font>) paused in hopes of an answer; but his (<font color='blue'><b>Darcy</b></font>) companion was not disposed
to make any; and Elizabeth at that instant moving towards them, he (<font color='blue'><b>Darcy</b></font>) was
struck with the action of doing a very gallant thing, and called out to
her (<font color='blue'><b>Elizabeth</b></font>):

<p/><div class="bookquote">``My dear Miss Eliza, why are you not dancing? Mr. Darcy, you must allow
me to present this young lady to you as a very desirable partner. You
cannot refuse to dance, I am sure when so much beauty is before you.''
 (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>And, taking her (<font color='blue'><b>Elizabeth</b></font>) hand, he (<font color='blue'><b>Darcy</b></font>) would have given it to Mr. Darcy who, though
extremely surprised, was not unwilling to receive it, when she (<font color='blue'><b>Elizabeth</b></font>) instantly
drew back, and said with some discomposure to Sir William:

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Indeed, sir, I have not the least intention of dancing. I entreat you
not to suppose that I moved this way in order to beg for a partner.''

 (<font color='red'><b>William/William Lucas</b></font>)</div><p/>Mr. Darcy, with grave propriety, requested to be allowed the honour of
her (<font color='blue'><b>Elizabeth</b></font>) hand, but in vain. Elizabeth was determined; nor did Sir William at
all shake her (<font color='blue'><b>Elizabeth</b></font>) purpose by his (<font color='blue'><b>William</b></font>) attempt at persuasion.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``You excel so much in the dance, Miss Eliza, that it is cruel to deny
me the happiness of seeing you; and though this gentleman dislikes the
amusement in general, he (<font color='blue'><b>gentleman</b></font>) can have no objection, I am sure, to oblige us
for one half-hour.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Mr. Darcy is all politeness,''  (<font color='red'><b>Elizabeth/Miss Bennet/Miss Elizabeth</b></font>)</div>said Elizabeth, smiling.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``He (<font color='blue'><b>Darcy</b></font>) is, indeed; but, considering the inducement, my dear Miss Eliza,
we cannot wonder at his (<font color='blue'><b>Darcy</b></font>) complaisance--for who would object to such a
partner?''

 (<font color='red'><b>Elizabeth/Miss Bennet/Miss Elizabeth</b></font>)</div><p/>Elizabeth looked archly, and turned away. Her (<font color='blue'><b>Elizabeth</b></font>) resistance had not
injured her (<font color='blue'><b>Elizabeth</b></font>) with the gentleman, and he (<font color='blue'><b>gentleman</b></font>) was thinking of her (<font color='blue'><b>Elizabeth</b></font>) with some
complacency, when thus accosted by Miss Bingley:

<p/><div class="bookquote">``I can guess the subject of your reverie.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Miss Bingley</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I should imagine not.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``You are considering how insupportable it would be to pass many evenings
in this manner--in such society; and indeed I am quite of your opinion.
I was never more annoyed! The insipidity, and yet the noise--the
nothingness, and yet the self-importance of all those people! What would
I give to hear your strictures on them!''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Your conjecture is totally wrong, I assure you. My mind was more
agreeably engaged. I have been meditating on the very great pleasure
which a pair of fine eyes in the face of a pretty woman can bestow.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Miss Bingley</b></font>)</div><p/>Miss Bingley immediately fixed her (<font color='blue'><b>Bingley</b></font>) eyes on his (<font color='blue'><b>gentleman</b></font>) face, and desired he (<font color='blue'><b>gentleman</b></font>)
would tell her (<font color='blue'><b>Bingley</b></font>) what lady had the credit of inspiring such reflections.
Mr. Darcy replied with great intrepidity:

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Miss Elizabeth Bennet.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Darcy/Darcy</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Miss Elizabeth Bennet!''  (<font color='red'><b>Miss Bingley</b></font>)</div>repeated Miss Bingley. <div class="bookquote">``I am all astonishment.
How long has she (<font color='blue'><b>Bennet</b></font>) been such a favourite?--and pray, when am I to wish you
joy?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``That is exactly the question which I expected you to ask. A lady's
imagination is very rapid; it jumps from admiration to love, from love
to matrimony, in a moment. I knew you would be wishing me joy.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Nay, if you are serious about it, I shall consider the matter is
absolutely settled. You will be having a charming mother-in-law, indeed;
and, of course, she (<font color='blue'><b>mother-in-law</b></font>) will always be at Pemberley with you.''

 (<font color='red'><b>He</b></font>)</div><p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Darcy</b></font>) listened to her (<font color='blue'><b>Bingley</b></font>) with perfect indifference while she (<font color='blue'><b>Bingley</b></font>) chose to
entertain herself in this manner; and as his (<font color='blue'><b>Darcy</b></font>) composure convinced her (<font color='blue'><b>Bingley</b></font>)
that all was safe, her (<font color='blue'><b>Bingley</b></font>) wit flowed long.



<p/>Chapter 7


<p/>Mr. Bennet's property consisted almost entirely in an estate of two
thousand a year, which, unfortunately for his (<font color='blue'><b>Bennet</b></font>) daughters, was entailed,
in default of heirs male, on a distant relation; and their mother's
fortune, though ample for her (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) situation in life, could but ill supply
the deficiency of his (<font color='blue'><b>Bennet</b></font>). Her (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) father had been an attorney in Meryton, and
had left her (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) four thousand pounds.

<p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) had a sister married to a Mr. Phillips, who had been a clerk to
their father and succeeded him (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) in the business, and a brother settled in
London in a respectable line of trade.

<p/>The village of Longbourn was only one mile from Meryton; a most
convenient distance for the young ladies, who were usually tempted
thither three or four times a week, to pay their duty to their aunt and
to a milliner's shop just over the way. The two youngest of the family,
Catherine and Lydia, were particularly frequent in these attentions;
their minds were more vacant than their sisters', and when nothing
better offered, a walk to Meryton was necessary to amuse their morning
hours and furnish conversation for the evening; and however bare of news
the country in general might be, they always contrived to learn some
from their aunt. At present, indeed, they were well supplied both with
news and happiness by the recent arrival of a militia regiment in the
neighbourhood; it was to remain the whole winter, and Meryton was the
headquarters.

<p/>Their visits to Mrs. Phillips were now productive of the most
interesting intelligence. Every day added something to their knowledge
of the officers' names and connections. Their lodgings were not long a
secret, and at length they began to know the officers themselves. Mr.
Phillips visited them all, and this opened to his (<font color='blue'><b>Phillips</b></font>) nieces a store of
felicity unknown before. They could talk of nothing but officers; and
Mr. Bingley's large fortune, the mention of which gave animation
to their mother, was worthless in their eyes when opposed to the
regimentals of an ensign.

<p/>After listening one morning to their effusions on this subject, Mr.
Bennet coolly observed:

<p/><div class="bookquote">``From all that I can collect by your manner of talking, you must be two
of the silliest girls in the country. I have suspected it some time, but
I am now convinced.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Bennet</b></font>)</div><p/>Catherine was disconcerted, and made no answer; but Lydia, with perfect
indifference, continued to express her (<font color='blue'><b>Lydia</b></font>) admiration of Captain Carter,
and her (<font color='blue'><b>Lydia</b></font>) hope of seeing him (<font color='blue'><b>Carter</b></font>) in the course of the day, as he (<font color='blue'><b>Carter</b></font>) was going the
next morning to London.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``I am astonished, my dear,''  (<font color='red'><b>Mrs. Bennet</b></font>)</div>said Mrs. Bennet, <div class="bookquote">``that you should be so
ready to think your own children silly. If I wished to think slightingly
of anybody's children, it should not be of my own, however.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Mrs. Bennet</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``If my children are silly, I must hope to be always sensible of it.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Yes--but as it happens, they are all of them very clever.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``This is the only point, I flatter myself, on which we do not agree. I
had hoped that our sentiments coincided in every particular, but I must
so far differ from you as to think our two youngest daughters uncommonly
foolish.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``My dear Mr. Bennet, you must not expect such girls to have the sense of
their father and mother. When they get to our age, I dare say they will
not think about officers any more than we do. I remember the time when
I liked a red coat myself very well--and, indeed, so I do still at my
heart; and if a smart young colonel, with five or six thousand a year,
should want one of my girls I shall not say nay to him (<font color='blue'><b>colonel</b></font>); and I thought
Colonel Forster looked very becoming the other night at Sir William's in
his (<font color='blue'><b>William</b></font>) regimentals.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Mamma,''  (<font color='red'><b>Lydia/Miss Lydia/Miss Lydia Bennet</b></font>)</div>cried Lydia, <div class="bookquote">``my aunt says that Colonel Forster and Captain
Carter do not go so often to Miss Watson's as they did when they first
came; she (<font color='blue'><b>Watson</b></font>) sees them now very often standing in Clarke's library.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Lydia/Miss Lydia/Miss Lydia Bennet</b></font>)</div><p/>Mrs. Bennet was prevented replying by the entrance of the footman with
a note for Miss Bennet; it came from Netherfield, and the servant waited
for an answer. Mrs. Bennet's eyes sparkled with pleasure, and she (<font color='blue'><b>Bennet</b></font>) was
eagerly calling out, while her (<font color='blue'><b>Bennet</b></font>) daughter read,

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Well, Jane, who is it from? What is it about? What does he (<font color='blue'><b>Clarke</b></font>) say? Well,
Jane, make haste and tell us; make haste, my love.''

 (<font color='red'><b>daughter</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``It is from Miss Bingley,''  (<font color='red'><b>Jane</b></font>)</div>said Jane, and then read it aloud.

<p/>``MY DEAR FRIEND,--

<p/>``If you are not so compassionate as to dine to-day with Louisa and me,
we shall be in danger of hating each other for the rest of our lives,
for a whole day's tete-a-tete between two women can never end without a
quarrel. Come as soon as you can on receipt of this. My brother and the
gentlemen are to dine with the officers.--Yours ever,

<p/><div class="bookquote">``CAROLINE BINGLEY''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``With the officers!''  (<font color='red'><b>Lydia/Miss Lydia/Miss Lydia Bennet</b></font>)</div>cried Lydia. <div class="bookquote">``I wonder my aunt did not tell us of
_that_.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Dining out,''  (<font color='red'><b>Mrs. Bennet</b></font>)</div>said Mrs. Bennet, <div class="bookquote">``that is very unlucky.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Mrs. Bennet</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Can I have the carriage?''  (<font color='red'><b>Jane</b></font>)</div>said Jane.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``No, my dear, you had better go on horseback, because it seems likely to
rain; and then you must stay all night.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``That would be a good scheme,''  (<font color='red'><b>Elizabeth/Miss Bennet/Miss Elizabeth</b></font>)</div>said Elizabeth, <div class="bookquote">``if you were sure that
they would not offer to send her (<font color='blue'><b>aunt</b></font>) home.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Elizabeth/Miss Bennet/Miss Elizabeth</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Oh! but the gentlemen will have Mr. Bingley's chaise to go to Meryton,
and the Hursts have no horses to theirs.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I had much rather go in the coach.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``But, my dear, your father cannot spare the horses, I am sure. They are
wanted in the farm, Mr. Bennet, are they not?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``They are wanted in the farm much oftener than I can get them.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``But if you have got them to-day,''  (<font color='red'><b>Elizabeth/Miss Bennet/Miss Elizabeth</b></font>)</div>said Elizabeth, <div class="bookquote">``my mother's purpose
will be answered.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Elizabeth/Miss Bennet/Miss Elizabeth</b></font>)</div><p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>Elizabeth</b></font>) did at last extort from her (<font color='blue'><b>Elizabeth</b></font>) father an acknowledgment that the horses
were engaged. Jane was therefore obliged to go on horseback, and her (<font color='blue'><b>Jane</b></font>)
mother attended her (<font color='blue'><b>Jane</b></font>) to the door with many cheerful prognostics of a
bad day. Her (<font color='blue'><b>Jane</b></font>) hopes were answered; Jane had not been gone long before
it rained hard. Her (<font color='blue'><b>Jane</b></font>) sisters were uneasy for her (<font color='blue'><b>Jane</b></font>), but her (<font color='blue'><b>Jane</b></font>) mother was
delighted. The rain continued the whole evening without intermission;
Jane certainly could not come back.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``This was a lucky idea of mine, indeed!''  (<font color='red'><b>Mrs. Bennet</b></font>)</div>said Mrs. Bennet more than
once, as if the credit of making it rain were all her (<font color='blue'><b>Bennet</b></font>) own. Till the
next morning, however, she (<font color='blue'><b>Bennet</b></font>) was not aware of all the felicity of her (<font color='blue'><b>Bennet</b></font>)
contrivance. Breakfast was scarcely over when a servant from Netherfield
brought the following note for Elizabeth:

<p/>``MY DEAREST LIZZY,--

<p/><div class="bookquote">``I find myself very unwell this morning, which, I suppose, is to be
imputed to my getting wet through yesterday. My kind friends will not
hear of my returning till I am better. They insist also on my seeing Mr.
Jones--therefore do not be alarmed if you should hear of his (<font color='blue'><b>Jones</b></font>) having been
to me--and, excepting a sore throat and headache, there is not much the
matter with me.--Yours, etc.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Elizabeth/Miss Bennet/Miss Elizabeth</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Well, my dear,''  (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Bennet</b></font>)</div>said Mr. Bennet, when Elizabeth had read the note
aloud, <div class="bookquote">``if your daughter should have a dangerous fit of illness--if she (<font color='blue'><b>daughter</b></font>)
should die, it would be a comfort to know that it was all in pursuit of
Mr. Bingley, and under your orders.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Elizabeth/Miss Bennet/Miss Elizabeth</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Oh! I am not afraid of her (<font color='blue'><b>daughter</b></font>) dying. People do not die of little trifling
colds. She (<font color='blue'><b>daughter</b></font>) will be taken good care of. As long as she (<font color='blue'><b>daughter</b></font>) stays there, it is
all very well. I would go and see her (<font color='blue'><b>daughter</b></font>) if I could have the carriage.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Elizabeth/Miss Bennet/Miss Elizabeth</b></font>)</div><p/>Elizabeth, feeling really anxious, was determined to go to her (<font color='blue'><b>Elizabeth</b></font>), though
the carriage was not to be had; and as she (<font color='blue'><b>Elizabeth</b></font>) was no horsewoman, walking
was her (<font color='blue'><b>Elizabeth</b></font>) only alternative. She (<font color='blue'><b>Elizabeth</b></font>) declared her (<font color='blue'><b>Elizabeth</b></font>) resolution.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``How can you be so silly,''  (<font color='red'><b>mother</b></font>)</div>cried her (<font color='blue'><b>Elizabeth</b></font>) mother, <div class="bookquote">``as to think of such a
thing, in all this dirt! You will not be fit to be seen when you get
there.''

 (<font color='red'><b>mother</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I shall be very fit to see Jane--which is all I want.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Is this a hint to me, Lizzy,''  (<font color='red'><b>father</b></font>)</div>said her (<font color='blue'><b>Elizabeth</b></font>) father, <div class="bookquote">``to send for the
horses?''

 (<font color='red'><b>father</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``No, indeed, I do not wish to avoid the walk. The distance is nothing
when one has a motive; only three miles. I shall be back by dinner.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I admire the activity of your benevolence,''  (<font color='red'><b>Mary/Mary King</b></font>)</div>observed Mary, <div class="bookquote">``but every
impulse of feeling should be guided by reason; and, in my opinion,
exertion should always be in proportion to what is required.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Mary/Mary King</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``We will go as far as Meryton with you,''  (<font color='red'><b>Lady Catherine/Lady Catherine de Bourgh/Catherine</b></font>)</div>said Catherine and Lydia.
Elizabeth accepted their company, and the three young ladies set off
together.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``If we make haste,''  (<font color='red'><b>Lydia/Miss Lydia/Miss Lydia Bennet</b></font>)</div>said Lydia, as they walked along, <div class="bookquote">``perhaps we may
see something of Captain Carter before he (<font color='blue'><b>Carter</b></font>) goes.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Lydia/Miss Lydia/Miss Lydia Bennet</b></font>)</div><p/>In Meryton they parted; the two youngest repaired to the lodgings of one
of the officers' wives, and Elizabeth continued her (<font color='blue'><b>Elizabeth</b></font>) walk alone, crossing
field after field at a quick pace, jumping over stiles and springing
over puddles with impatient activity, and finding herself at last
within view of the house, with weary ankles, dirty stockings, and a face
glowing with the warmth of exercise.

<p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>Elizabeth</b></font>) was shown into the breakfast-parlour, where all but Jane were
assembled, and where her (<font color='blue'><b>Jane</b></font>) appearance created a great deal of surprise.
That she (<font color='blue'><b>Jane</b></font>) should have walked three miles so early in the day, in such
dirty weather, and by herself, was almost incredible to Mrs. Hurst and
Miss Bingley; and Elizabeth was convinced that they held her (<font color='blue'><b>Elizabeth</b></font>) in contempt
for it. She (<font color='blue'><b>Elizabeth</b></font>) was received, however, very politely by them; and in their
brother's manners there was something better than politeness; there
was good humour and kindness. Mr. Darcy said very little, and Mr.
Hurst nothing at all. The former was divided between admiration of the
brilliancy which exercise had given to her (<font color='blue'><b>Elizabeth</b></font>) complexion, and doubt as
to the occasion's justifying her (<font color='blue'><b>Elizabeth</b></font>) coming so far alone. The latter was
thinking only of his (<font color='blue'><b>Darcy</b></font>) breakfast.

<p/>Her (<font color='blue'><b>Elizabeth</b></font>) inquiries after her (<font color='blue'><b>Elizabeth</b></font>) sister were not very favourably answered. Miss
Bennet had slept ill, and though up, was very feverish, and not
well enough to leave her (<font color='blue'><b>Bennet</b></font>) room. Elizabeth was glad to be taken to her (<font color='blue'><b>Elizabeth</b></font>)
immediately; and Jane, who had only been withheld by the fear of giving
alarm or inconvenience from expressing in her (<font color='blue'><b>Elizabeth</b></font>) note how much she (<font color='blue'><b>Elizabeth</b></font>) longed
for such a visit, was delighted at her (<font color='blue'><b>Elizabeth</b></font>) entrance. She (<font color='blue'><b>Elizabeth</b></font>) was not equal,
however, to much conversation, and when Miss Bingley left them
together, could attempt little besides expressions of gratitude for the
extraordinary kindness she (<font color='blue'><b>Bingley</b></font>) was treated with. Elizabeth silently attended
her (<font color='blue'><b>Elizabeth</b></font>).

<p/>When breakfast was over they were joined by the sisters; and Elizabeth
began to like them herself, when she (<font color='blue'><b>Elizabeth</b></font>) saw how much affection and
solicitude they showed for Jane. The apothecary came, and having
examined his (<font color='blue'><b>Elizabeth</b></font>) patient, said, as might be supposed, that she (<font color='blue'><b>Jane</b></font>) had caught
a violent cold, and that they must endeavour to get the better of it;
advised her (<font color='blue'><b>Jane</b></font>) to return to bed, and promised her (<font color='blue'><b>Jane</b></font>) some draughts. The advice
was followed readily, for the feverish symptoms increased, and her (<font color='blue'><b>Jane</b></font>) head
ached acutely. Elizabeth did not quit her (<font color='blue'><b>Elizabeth</b></font>) room for a moment; nor were
the other ladies often absent; the gentlemen being out, they had, in
fact, nothing to do elsewhere.

<p/>When the clock struck three, Elizabeth felt that she (<font color='blue'><b>Elizabeth</b></font>) must go, and very
unwillingly said so. Miss Bingley offered her (<font color='blue'><b>Bingley</b></font>) the carriage, and she (<font color='blue'><b>Bingley</b></font>) only
wanted a little pressing to accept it, when Jane testified such concern
in parting with her (<font color='blue'><b>Jane</b></font>), that Miss Bingley was obliged to convert the offer
of the chaise to an invitation to remain at Netherfield for the present.
Elizabeth most thankfully consented, and a servant was dispatched to
Longbourn to acquaint the family with her (<font color='blue'><b>Elizabeth</b></font>) stay and bring back a supply
of clothes.



<p/>Chapter 8


<p/>At five o'clock the two ladies retired to dress, and at half-past six
Elizabeth was summoned to dinner. To the civil inquiries which then
poured in, and amongst which she (<font color='blue'><b>Elizabeth</b></font>) had the pleasure of distinguishing the
much superior solicitude of Mr. Bingley's, she (<font color='blue'><b>Elizabeth</b></font>) could not make a very
favourable answer. Jane was by no means better. The sisters, on hearing
this, repeated three or four times how much they were grieved, how
shocking it was to have a bad cold, and how excessively they disliked
being ill themselves; and then thought no more of the matter: and their
indifference towards Jane when not immediately before them restored
Elizabeth to the enjoyment of all her (<font color='blue'><b>Elizabeth</b></font>) former dislike.

<p/>Their brother, indeed, was the only one of the party whom she (<font color='blue'><b>Elizabeth</b></font>) could
regard with any complacency. His (<font color='blue'><b>brother</b></font>) anxiety for Jane was evident, and his (<font color='blue'><b>brother</b></font>)
attentions to herself most pleasing, and they prevented her (<font color='blue'><b>Jane</b></font>) feeling
herself so much an intruder as she (<font color='blue'><b>Jane</b></font>) believed she (<font color='blue'><b>Jane</b></font>) was considered by the
others. She (<font color='blue'><b>Jane</b></font>) had very little notice from any but him (<font color='blue'><b>intruder</b></font>). Miss Bingley was
engrossed by Mr. Darcy, her (<font color='blue'><b>Bingley</b></font>) sister scarcely less so; and as for Mr.
Hurst, by whom Elizabeth sat, he (<font color='blue'><b>Hurst</b></font>) was an indolent man, who lived only to
eat, drink, and play at cards; who, when he (<font color='blue'><b>Hurst</b></font>) found her (<font color='blue'><b>Elizabeth</b></font>) to prefer a plain
dish to a ragout, had nothing to say to her (<font color='blue'><b>Elizabeth</b></font>).

<p/>When dinner was over, she (<font color='blue'><b>Elizabeth</b></font>) returned directly to Jane, and Miss Bingley
began abusing her (<font color='blue'><b>Bingley</b></font>) as soon as she (<font color='blue'><b>Bingley</b></font>) was out of the room. Her (<font color='blue'><b>Bingley</b></font>) manners were
pronounced to be very bad indeed, a mixture of pride and impertinence;
she (<font color='blue'><b>Bingley</b></font>) had no conversation, no style, no beauty. Mrs. Hurst thought the
same, and added:

<p/><div class="bookquote">``She (<font color='blue'><b>we</b></font>) has nothing, in short, to recommend her (<font color='blue'><b>we</b></font>), but being an excellent
walker. I shall never forget her (<font color='blue'><b>we</b></font>) appearance this morning. She (<font color='blue'><b>we</b></font>) really
looked almost wild.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Mrs. Hurst</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``She (<font color='blue'><b>we</b></font>) did, indeed, Louisa. I could hardly keep my countenance. Very
nonsensical to come at all! Why must _she (<font color='blue'><b>we</b></font>)_ be scampering about the
country, because her (<font color='blue'><b>we</b></font>) sister had a cold? Her (<font color='blue'><b>we</b></font>) hair, so untidy, so blowsy!''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Yes, and her (<font color='blue'><b>we</b></font>) petticoat; I hope you saw her (<font color='blue'><b>we</b></font>) petticoat, six inches deep
in mud, I am absolutely certain; and the gown which had been let down to
hide it not doing its office.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Your picture may be very exact, Louisa,''  (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Bingley/Bingley</b></font>)</div>said Bingley; <div class="bookquote">``but this was
all lost upon me. I thought Miss Elizabeth Bennet looked remarkably
well when she (<font color='blue'><b>Bennet</b></font>) came into the room this morning. Her (<font color='blue'><b>Bennet</b></font>) dirty petticoat quite
escaped my notice.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Bingley/Bingley</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">''_You_ observed it, Mr. Darcy, I am sure,''  (<font color='red'><b>Miss Bingley</b></font>)</div>said Miss Bingley; <div class="bookquote">``and I am
inclined to think that you would not wish to see _your_ sister make such
an exhibition.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Miss Bingley</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Certainly not.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``To walk three miles, or four miles, or five miles, or whatever it is,
above her (<font color='blue'><b>sister</b></font>) ankles in dirt, and alone, quite alone! What could she (<font color='blue'><b>sister</b></font>) mean by
it? It seems to me to show an abominable sort of conceited independence,
a most country-town indifference to decorum.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``It shows an affection for her (<font color='blue'><b>sister</b></font>) sister that is very pleasing,''  (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Bingley/Bingley</b></font>)</div>said
Bingley.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``I am afraid, Mr. Darcy,''  (<font color='red'><b>Miss Bingley</b></font>)</div>observed Miss Bingley in a half whisper, <div class="bookquote">``that
this adventure has rather affected your admiration of her (<font color='blue'><b>sister</b></font>) fine eyes.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Miss Bingley</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Not at all,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Bingley</b></font>) replied; <div class="bookquote">``they were brightened by the exercise.''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>A
short pause followed this speech, and Mrs. Hurst began again:

<p/><div class="bookquote">``I have an excessive regard for Miss Jane Bennet, she (<font color='blue'><b>Bennet</b></font>) is really a very
sweet girl, and I wish with all my heart she (<font color='blue'><b>Bennet</b></font>) were well settled. But with
such a father and mother, and such low connections, I am afraid there is
no chance of it.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Mrs. Hurst</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I think I have heard you say that their uncle is an attorney in
Meryton.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Yes; and they have another, who lives somewhere near Cheapside.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``That is capital,''  (<font color='red'><b>sister</b></font>)</div>added her (<font color='blue'><b>Hurst</b></font>) sister, and they both laughed heartily.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``If they had uncles enough to fill _all_ Cheapside,''  (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Bingley/Bingley</b></font>)</div>cried Bingley, <div class="bookquote">``it
would not make them one jot less agreeable.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Bingley/Bingley</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``But it must very materially lessen their chance of marrying men of any
consideration in the world,''  (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Darcy/Darcy</b></font>)</div>replied Darcy.

<p/>To this speech Bingley made no answer; but his (<font color='blue'><b>Bingley</b></font>) sisters gave it their
hearty assent, and indulged their mirth for some time at the expense of
their dear friend's vulgar relations.

<p/>With a renewal of tenderness, however, they returned to her (<font color='blue'><b>Hurst</b></font>) room on
leaving the dining-parlour, and sat with her (<font color='blue'><b>Hurst</b></font>) till summoned to coffee.
She (<font color='blue'><b>Hurst</b></font>) was still very poorly, and Elizabeth would not quit her (<font color='blue'><b>Elizabeth</b></font>) at all, till
late in the evening, when she (<font color='blue'><b>Elizabeth</b></font>) had the comfort of seeing her (<font color='blue'><b>Elizabeth</b></font>) sleep, and
when it seemed to her (<font color='blue'><b>Elizabeth</b></font>) rather right than pleasant that she (<font color='blue'><b>Elizabeth</b></font>) should go
downstairs herself. On entering the drawing-room she (<font color='blue'><b>Elizabeth</b></font>) found the whole
party at loo, and was immediately invited to join them; but suspecting
them to be playing high she (<font color='blue'><b>Elizabeth</b></font>) declined it, and making her (<font color='blue'><b>Elizabeth</b></font>) sister the
excuse, said she (<font color='blue'><b>Elizabeth</b></font>) would amuse herself for the short time she (<font color='blue'><b>Elizabeth</b></font>) could stay
below, with a book. Mr. Hurst looked at her (<font color='blue'><b>Elizabeth</b></font>) with astonishment.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Do you prefer reading to cards?''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>said he (<font color='blue'><b>Hurst</b></font>); <div class="bookquote">``that is rather singular.''

 (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Miss Eliza Bennet,''  (<font color='red'><b>Miss Bingley</b></font>)</div>said Miss Bingley, <div class="bookquote">``despises cards. She (<font color='blue'><b>Bennet</b></font>) is a great
reader, and has no pleasure in anything else.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Miss Bingley</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I deserve neither such praise nor such censure,''  (<font color='red'><b>Elizabeth/Miss Bennet/Miss Elizabeth</b></font>)</div>cried Elizabeth; <div class="bookquote">``I am
_not_ a great reader, and I have pleasure in many things.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Elizabeth/Miss Bennet/Miss Elizabeth</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``In nursing your sister I am sure you have pleasure,''  (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Bingley/Bingley</b></font>)</div>said Bingley; <div class="bookquote">``and
I hope it will be soon increased by seeing her (<font color='blue'><b>sister</b></font>) quite well.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Bingley/Bingley</b></font>)</div><p/>Elizabeth thanked him (<font color='blue'><b>Bingley</b></font>) from her (<font color='blue'><b>Elizabeth</b></font>) heart, and then walked towards the
table where a few books were lying. He (<font color='blue'><b>Bingley</b></font>) immediately offered to fetch her (<font color='blue'><b>Elizabeth</b></font>)
others--all that his (<font color='blue'><b>Bingley</b></font>) library afforded.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``And I wish my collection were larger for your benefit and my own
credit; but I am an idle fellow, and though I have not many, I have more
than I ever looked into.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Elizabeth/Miss Bennet/Miss Elizabeth</b></font>)</div><p/>Elizabeth assured him (<font color='blue'><b>Bingley</b></font>) that she (<font color='blue'><b>Elizabeth</b></font>) could suit herself perfectly with those
in the room.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``I am astonished,''  (<font color='red'><b>Miss Bingley</b></font>)</div>said Miss Bingley, <div class="bookquote">``that my father should have left
so small a collection of books. What a delightful library you have at
Pemberley, Mr. Darcy!''

 (<font color='red'><b>Miss Bingley</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``It ought to be good,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Bingley</b></font>) replied, <div class="bookquote">``it has been the work of many
generations.''

 (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``And then you have added so much to it yourself, you are always buying
books.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I cannot comprehend the neglect of a family library in such days as
these.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Neglect! I am sure you neglect nothing that can add to the beauties of
that noble place. Charles, when you build _your_ house, I wish it may be
half as delightful as Pemberley.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I wish it may.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``But I would really advise you to make your purchase in that
neighbourhood, and take Pemberley for a kind of model. There is not a
finer county in England than Derbyshire.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``With all my heart; I will buy Pemberley itself if Darcy will sell it.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I am talking of possibilities, Charles.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Upon my word, Caroline, I should think it more possible to get
Pemberley by purchase than by imitation.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Elizabeth/Miss Bennet/Miss Elizabeth</b></font>)</div><p/>Elizabeth was so much caught with what passed, as to leave her (<font color='blue'><b>Elizabeth</b></font>) very
little attention for her (<font color='blue'><b>Elizabeth</b></font>) book; and soon laying it wholly aside, she (<font color='blue'><b>Elizabeth</b></font>) drew
near the card-table, and stationed herself between Mr. Bingley and his (<font color='blue'><b>Bingley</b></font>)
eldest sister, to observe the game.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Is Miss Darcy much grown since the spring?''  (<font color='red'><b>Miss Bingley</b></font>)</div>said Miss Bingley; <div class="bookquote">``will
she (<font color='blue'><b>Darcy</b></font>) be as tall as I am?''

 (<font color='red'><b>Miss Bingley</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I think she (<font color='blue'><b>Darcy</b></font>) will. She (<font color='blue'><b>Darcy</b></font>) is now about Miss Elizabeth Bennet's height, or
rather taller.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``How I long to see her (<font color='blue'><b>Darcy</b></font>) again! I never met with anybody who delighted me
so much. Such a countenance, such manners! And so extremely accomplished
for her (<font color='blue'><b>Darcy</b></font>) age! Her (<font color='blue'><b>Darcy</b></font>) performance on the pianoforte is exquisite.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``It is amazing to me,''  (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Bingley/Bingley</b></font>)</div>said Bingley, <div class="bookquote">``how young ladies can have patience
to be so very accomplished as they all are.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Bingley/Bingley</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``All young ladies accomplished! My dear Charles, what do you mean?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Yes, all of them, I think. They all paint tables, cover screens, and
net purses. I scarcely know anyone who cannot do all this, and I am sure
I never heard a young lady spoken of for the first time, without being
informed that she (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) was very accomplished.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Your list of the common extent of accomplishments,''  (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Darcy/Darcy</b></font>)</div>said Darcy, <div class="bookquote">``has
too much truth. The word is applied to many a woman who deserves it no
otherwise than by netting a purse or covering a screen. But I am very
far from agreeing with you in your estimation of ladies in general. I
cannot boast of knowing more than half-a-dozen, in the whole range of my
acquaintance, that are really accomplished.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Darcy/Darcy</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Nor I, I am sure,''  (<font color='red'><b>Miss Bingley</b></font>)</div>said Miss Bingley.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Then,''  (<font color='red'><b>Elizabeth/Miss Bennet/Miss Elizabeth</b></font>)</div>observed Elizabeth, <div class="bookquote">``you must comprehend a great deal in your
idea of an accomplished woman.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Elizabeth/Miss Bennet/Miss Elizabeth</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Yes, I do comprehend a great deal in it.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Oh! certainly,''  (<font color='red'><b>faithful</b></font>)</div>cried his (<font color='blue'><b>Darcy</b></font>) faithful assistant, <div class="bookquote">``no one can be really
esteemed accomplished who does not greatly surpass what is usually met
with. A woman must have a thorough knowledge of music, singing, drawing,
dancing, and the modern languages, to deserve the word; and besides
all this, she (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) must possess a certain something in her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) air and manner of
walking, the tone of her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) voice, her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) address and expressions, or the word
will be but half-deserved.''

 (<font color='red'><b>faithful assistant</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``All this she (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) must possess,''  (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Darcy/Darcy</b></font>)</div>added Darcy, <div class="bookquote">``and to all this she (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) must
yet add something more substantial, in the improvement of her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) mind by
extensive reading.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Darcy/Darcy</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I am no longer surprised at your knowing _only_ six accomplished women.
I rather wonder now at your knowing _any_.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Are you so severe upon your own sex as to doubt the possibility of all
this?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I never saw such a woman. I never saw such capacity, and taste, and
application, and elegance, as you describe united.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Mrs. Hurst</b></font>)</div><p/>Mrs. Hurst and Miss Bingley both cried out against the injustice of her (<font color='blue'><b>Hurst</b></font>)
implied doubt, and were both protesting that they knew many women who
answered this description, when Mr. Hurst called them to order, with
bitter complaints of their inattention to what was going forward. As all
conversation was thereby at an end, Elizabeth soon afterwards left the
room.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Elizabeth Bennet,''  (<font color='red'><b>Miss Bingley</b></font>)</div>said Miss Bingley, when the door was closed on her (<font color='blue'><b>Bingley</b></font>),
<div class="bookquote">``is one of those young ladies who seek to recommend themselves to the
other sex by undervaluing their own; and with many men, I dare say, it
succeeds. But, in my opinion, it is a paltry device, a very mean art.''

 (<font color='red'><b>her</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Undoubtedly,''  (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Darcy/Darcy</b></font>)</div>replied Darcy, to whom this remark was chiefly addressed,
<div class="bookquote">``there is a meanness in _all_ the arts which ladies sometimes condescend
to employ for captivation. Whatever bears affinity to cunning is
despicable.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Darcy/Darcy</b></font>)</div><p/>Miss Bingley was not so entirely satisfied with this reply as to
continue the subject.

<p/>Elizabeth joined them again only to say that her (<font color='blue'><b>Elizabeth</b></font>) sister was worse, and
that she (<font color='blue'><b>Elizabeth</b></font>) could not leave her (<font color='blue'><b>Elizabeth</b></font>). Bingley urged Mr. Jones being sent for
immediately; while his (<font color='blue'><b>Bingley</b></font>) sisters, convinced that no country advice could
be of any service, recommended an express to town for one of the most
eminent physicians. This she (<font color='blue'><b>Elizabeth</b></font>) would not hear of; but she (<font color='blue'><b>Elizabeth</b></font>) was not so
unwilling to comply with their brother's proposal; and it was settled
that Mr. Jones should be sent for early in the morning, if Miss Bennet
were not decidedly better. Bingley was quite uncomfortable; his (<font color='blue'><b>Bingley</b></font>) sisters
declared that they were miserable. They solaced their wretchedness,
however, by duets after supper, while he (<font color='blue'><b>Bingley</b></font>) could find no better relief
to his (<font color='blue'><b>Bingley</b></font>) feelings than by giving his (<font color='blue'><b>Bingley</b></font>) housekeeper directions that every
attention might be paid to the sick lady and her (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) sister.



<p/>Chapter 9


<p/>Elizabeth passed the chief of the night in her (<font color='blue'><b>Elizabeth</b></font>) sister's room, and in the
morning had the pleasure of being able to send a tolerable answer to the
inquiries which she (<font color='blue'><b>Elizabeth</b></font>) very early received from Mr. Bingley by a housemaid,
and some time afterwards from the two elegant ladies who waited on his (<font color='blue'><b>Bingley</b></font>)
sisters. In spite of this amendment, however, she (<font color='blue'><b>Elizabeth</b></font>) requested to have a
note sent to Longbourn, desiring her (<font color='blue'><b>Elizabeth</b></font>) mother to visit Jane, and form her (<font color='blue'><b>Elizabeth</b></font>)
own judgement of her (<font color='blue'><b>Elizabeth</b></font>) situation. The note was immediately dispatched, and
its contents as quickly complied with. Mrs. Bennet, accompanied by her (<font color='blue'><b>Bennet</b></font>)
two youngest girls, reached Netherfield soon after the family breakfast.

<p/>Had she (<font color='blue'><b>Bennet</b></font>) found Jane in any apparent danger, Mrs. Bennet would have been
very miserable; but being satisfied on seeing her (<font color='blue'><b>Bennet</b></font>) that her (<font color='blue'><b>Bennet</b></font>) illness was
not alarming, she (<font color='blue'><b>Bennet</b></font>) had no wish of her (<font color='blue'><b>Bennet</b></font>) recovering immediately, as her (<font color='blue'><b>Bennet</b></font>)
restoration to health would probably remove her (<font color='blue'><b>Bennet</b></font>) from Netherfield. She (<font color='blue'><b>Bennet</b></font>)
would not listen, therefore, to her (<font color='blue'><b>Bennet</b></font>) daughter's proposal of being carried
home; neither did the apothecary, who arrived about the same time, think
it at all advisable. After sitting a little while with Jane, on Miss
Bingley's appearance and invitation, the mother and three daughters all
attended her (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) into the breakfast parlour. Bingley met them with hopes
that Mrs. Bennet had not found Miss Bennet worse than she (<font color='blue'><b>Bennet</b></font>) expected.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Indeed I have, sir,''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>was her (<font color='blue'><b>Bennet</b></font>) answer. <div class="bookquote">``She (<font color='blue'><b>Bennet</b></font>) is a great deal too ill to be
moved. Mr. Jones says we must not think of moving her (<font color='blue'><b>Bennet</b></font>). We must trespass
a little longer on your kindness.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Removed!''  (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Bingley/Bingley</b></font>)</div>cried Bingley. <div class="bookquote">``It must not be thought of. My sister, I am
sure, will not hear of her (<font color='blue'><b>sister</b></font>) removal.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``You may depend upon it, Madam,''  (<font color='red'><b>Miss Bingley</b></font>)</div>said Miss Bingley, with cold civility,
<div class="bookquote">``that Miss Bennet will receive every possible attention while she (<font color='blue'><b>Bennet</b></font>)
remains with us.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Miss Bingley</b></font>)</div><p/>Mrs. Bennet was profuse in her (<font color='blue'><b>Bennet</b></font>) acknowledgments.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``I am sure,''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Bennet</b></font>) added, <div class="bookquote">``if it was not for such good friends I do not
know what would become of her (<font color='blue'><b>Bennet</b></font>), for she (<font color='blue'><b>Bennet</b></font>) is very ill indeed, and suffers
a vast deal, though with the greatest patience in the world, which is
always the way with her (<font color='blue'><b>Bennet</b></font>), for she (<font color='blue'><b>Bennet</b></font>) has, without exception, the sweetest
temper I have ever met with. I often tell my other girls they are
nothing to _her (<font color='blue'><b>Bennet</b></font>)_. You have a sweet room here, Mr. Bingley, and a
charming prospect over the gravel walk. I do not know a place in the
country that is equal to Netherfield. You will not think of quitting it
in a hurry, I hope, though you have but a short lease.''

 (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Whatever I do is done in a hurry,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>replied he (<font color='blue'><b>Bingley</b></font>); <div class="bookquote">``and therefore if I
should resolve to quit Netherfield, I should probably be off in five
minutes. At present, however, I consider myself as quite fixed here.''

 (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``That is exactly what I should have supposed of you,''  (<font color='red'><b>Elizabeth/Miss Bennet/Miss Elizabeth</b></font>)</div>said Elizabeth.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``You begin to comprehend me, do you?''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>cried he (<font color='blue'><b>Bingley</b></font>), turning towards her (<font color='blue'><b>Elizabeth</b></font>).

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Oh! yes--I understand you perfectly.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I wish I might take this for a compliment; but to be so easily seen
through I am afraid is pitiful.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``That is as it happens. It does not follow that a deep, intricate
character is more or less estimable than such a one as yours.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Lizzy,''  (<font color='red'><b>mother</b></font>)</div>cried her (<font color='blue'><b>Elizabeth</b></font>) mother, <div class="bookquote">``remember where you are, and do not run on in
the wild manner that you are suffered to do at home.''

 (<font color='red'><b>mother</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I did not know before,''  (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Bingley/Bingley</b></font>)</div>continued Bingley immediately, <div class="bookquote">``that you were a
studier of character. It must be an amusing study.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Bingley/Bingley</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Yes, but intricate characters are the _most_ amusing. They have at
least that advantage.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``The country,''  (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Darcy/Darcy</b></font>)</div>said Darcy, <div class="bookquote">``can in general supply but a few subjects for
such a study. In a country neighbourhood you move in a very confined and
unvarying society.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Darcy/Darcy</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``But people themselves alter so much, that there is something new to be
observed in them for ever.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Yes, indeed,''  (<font color='red'><b>Mrs. Bennet</b></font>)</div>cried Mrs. Bennet, offended by his (<font color='blue'><b>Darcy</b></font>) manner of mentioning
a country neighbourhood. <div class="bookquote">``I assure you there is quite as much of _that_
going on in the country as in town.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Everybody</b></font>)</div><p/>Everybody was surprised, and Darcy, after looking at her (<font color='blue'><b>Bennet</b></font>) for a moment,
turned silently away. Mrs. Bennet, who fancied she (<font color='blue'><b>Bennet</b></font>) had gained a complete
victory over him (<font color='blue'><b>Darcy</b></font>), continued her (<font color='blue'><b>Bennet</b></font>) triumph.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``I cannot see that London has any great advantage over the country, for
my part, except the shops and public places. The country is a vast deal
pleasanter, is it not, Mr. Bingley?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``When I am in the country,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Darcy</b></font>) replied, <div class="bookquote">``I never wish to leave it;
and when I am in town it is pretty much the same. They have each their
advantages, and I can be equally happy in either.''

 (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Aye--that is because you have the right disposition. But that
gentleman,''  (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Darcy/Darcy</b></font>)</div>looking at Darcy, <div class="bookquote">``seemed to think the country was nothing
at all.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Darcy/Darcy</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Indeed, Mamma, you are mistaken,''  (<font color='red'><b>Elizabeth/Miss Bennet/Miss Elizabeth</b></font>)</div>said Elizabeth, blushing for her (<font color='blue'><b>Elizabeth</b></font>)
mother. <div class="bookquote">``You quite mistook Mr. Darcy. He (<font color='blue'><b>Darcy</b></font>) only meant that there was not
such a variety of people to be met with in the country as in the town,
which you must acknowledge to be true.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Certainly, my dear, nobody said there were; but as to not meeting
with many people in this neighbourhood, I believe there are few
neighbourhoods larger. I know we dine with four-and-twenty families.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Elizabeth/Miss Bennet/Miss Elizabeth</b></font>)</div><p/>Nothing but concern for Elizabeth could enable Bingley to keep his (<font color='blue'><b>Bingley</b></font>)
countenance. His (<font color='blue'><b>Bingley</b></font>) sister was less delicate, and directed her (<font color='blue'><b>sister</b></font>) eyes towards
Mr. Darcy with a very expressive smile. Elizabeth, for the sake of
saying something that might turn her (<font color='blue'><b>Elizabeth</b></font>) mother's thoughts, now asked her (<font color='blue'><b>Elizabeth</b></font>) if
Charlotte Lucas had been at Longbourn since _her (<font color='blue'><b>Lucas</b></font>)_ coming away.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Yes, she (<font color='blue'><b>nobody</b></font>) called yesterday with her (<font color='blue'><b>nobody</b></font>) father. What an agreeable man Sir
William is, Mr. Bingley, is not he (<font color='blue'><b>Bingley</b></font>)? So much the man of fashion! So
genteel and easy! He (<font color='blue'><b>Bingley</b></font>) has always something to say to everybody. _That_
is my idea of good breeding; and those persons who fancy themselves very
important, and never open their mouths, quite mistake the matter.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Did Charlotte dine with you?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``No, she (<font color='blue'><b>Charlotte</b></font>) would go home. I fancy she (<font color='blue'><b>Charlotte</b></font>) was wanted about the mince-pies. For
my part, Mr. Bingley, I always keep servants that can do their own work;
_my_ daughters are brought up very differently. But everybody is to
judge for themselves, and the Lucases are a very good sort of girls,
I assure you. It is a pity they are not handsome! Not that I think
Charlotte so _very_ plain--but then she (<font color='blue'><b>Charlotte</b></font>) is our particular friend.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``She (<font color='blue'><b>Charlotte</b></font>) seems a very pleasant young woman.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Oh! dear, yes; but you must own she (<font color='blue'><b>Charlotte</b></font>) is very plain. Lady Lucas herself
has often said so, and envied me Jane's beauty. I do not like to boast
of my own child, but to be sure, Jane--one does not often see anybody
better looking. It is what everybody says. I do not trust my own
partiality. When she (<font color='blue'><b>Jane</b></font>) was only fifteen, there was a man at my brother
Gardiner's in town so much in love with her (<font color='blue'><b>Jane</b></font>) that my sister-in-law was
sure he (<font color='blue'><b>Gardiner</b></font>) would make her (<font color='blue'><b>Jane</b></font>) an offer before we came away. But, however, he (<font color='blue'><b>Gardiner</b></font>)
did not. Perhaps he (<font color='blue'><b>Gardiner</b></font>) thought her (<font color='blue'><b>Jane</b></font>) too young. However, he (<font color='blue'><b>Gardiner</b></font>) wrote some verses
on her (<font color='blue'><b>Jane</b></font>), and very pretty they were.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``And so ended his (<font color='blue'><b>Gardiner</b></font>) affection,''  (<font color='red'><b>Elizabeth/Miss Bennet/Miss Elizabeth</b></font>)</div>said Elizabeth impatiently. <div class="bookquote">``There has
been many a one, I fancy, overcome in the same way. I wonder who first
discovered the efficacy of poetry in driving away love!''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I have been used to consider poetry as the _food_ of love,''  (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Darcy/Darcy</b></font>)</div>said Darcy.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Of a fine, stout, healthy love it may. Everything nourishes what is
strong already. But if it be only a slight, thin sort of inclination, I
am convinced that one good sonnet will starve it entirely away.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Darcy/Darcy</b></font>)</div><p/>Darcy only smiled; and the general pause which ensued made Elizabeth
tremble lest her (<font color='blue'><b>Elizabeth</b></font>) mother should be exposing herself again. She (<font color='blue'><b>Elizabeth</b></font>) longed to
speak, but could think of nothing to say; and after a short silence Mrs.
Bennet began repeating her (<font color='blue'><b>Bennet</b></font>) thanks to Mr. Bingley for his (<font color='blue'><b>Bingley</b></font>) kindness to
Jane, with an apology for troubling him (<font color='blue'><b>Bingley</b></font>) also with Lizzy. Mr. Bingley was
unaffectedly civil in his (<font color='blue'><b>Bingley</b></font>) answer, and forced his (<font color='blue'><b>Bingley</b></font>) younger sister to be
civil also, and say what the occasion required. She (<font color='blue'><b>sister</b></font>) performed her (<font color='blue'><b>sister</b></font>) part
indeed without much graciousness, but Mrs. Bennet was satisfied, and
soon afterwards ordered her (<font color='blue'><b>Bennet</b></font>) carriage. Upon this signal, the youngest of
her (<font color='blue'><b>Bennet</b></font>) daughters put herself forward. The two girls had been whispering to
each other during the whole visit, and the result of it was, that the
youngest should tax Mr. Bingley with having promised on his (<font color='blue'><b>Bingley</b></font>) first coming
into the country to give a ball at Netherfield.

<p/>Lydia was a stout, well-grown girl of fifteen, with a fine complexion
and good-humoured countenance; a favourite with her (<font color='blue'><b>Lydia</b></font>) mother, whose
affection had brought her (<font color='blue'><b>Lydia</b></font>) into public at an early age. She (<font color='blue'><b>Lydia</b></font>) had high
animal spirits, and a sort of natural self-consequence, which the
attention of the officers, to whom her (<font color='blue'><b>Lydia</b></font>) uncle's good dinners, and her (<font color='blue'><b>Lydia</b></font>) own
easy manners recommended her (<font color='blue'><b>Lydia</b></font>), had increased into assurance. She (<font color='blue'><b>Lydia</b></font>) was very
equal, therefore, to address Mr. Bingley on the subject of the ball, and
abruptly reminded him (<font color='blue'><b>Bingley</b></font>) of his (<font color='blue'><b>Bingley</b></font>) promise; adding, that it would be the most
shameful thing in the world if he (<font color='blue'><b>Bingley</b></font>) did not keep it. His (<font color='blue'><b>Bingley</b></font>) answer to this
sudden attack was delightful to their mother's ear:

<p/><div class="bookquote">``I am perfectly ready, I assure you, to keep my engagement; and when
your sister is recovered, you shall, if you please, name the very day of
the ball. But you would not wish to be dancing when she (<font color='blue'><b>sister</b></font>) is ill.''

 (<font color='red'><b>mother</b></font>)</div><p/>Lydia declared herself satisfied. <div class="bookquote">``Oh! yes--it would be much better to
wait till Jane was well, and by that time most likely Captain Carter
would be at Meryton again. And when you have given _your_ ball,''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Lydia</b></font>)
added, <div class="bookquote">``I shall insist on their giving one also. I shall tell Colonel
Forster it will be quite a shame if he (<font color='blue'><b>Colonel</b></font>) does not.''

 (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div><p/>Mrs. Bennet and her (<font color='blue'><b>Bennet</b></font>) daughters then departed, and Elizabeth returned
instantly to Jane, leaving her (<font color='blue'><b>Elizabeth</b></font>) own and her (<font color='blue'><b>Elizabeth</b></font>) relations' behaviour to the
remarks of the two ladies and Mr. Darcy; the latter of whom, however,
could not be prevailed on to join in their censure of _her (<font color='blue'><b>Elizabeth</b></font>)_, in spite of
all Miss Bingley's witticisms on _fine eyes_.



<p/>Chapter 10


<p/>The day passed much as the day before had done. Mrs. Hurst and Miss
Bingley had spent some hours of the morning with the invalid, who
continued, though slowly, to mend; and in the evening Elizabeth joined
their party in the drawing-room. The loo-table, however, did not appear.
Mr. Darcy was writing, and Miss Bingley, seated near him (<font color='blue'><b>Darcy</b></font>), was watching
the progress of his (<font color='blue'><b>Darcy</b></font>) letter and repeatedly calling off his (<font color='blue'><b>Darcy</b></font>) attention by
messages to his (<font color='blue'><b>Darcy</b></font>) sister. Mr. Hurst and Mr. Bingley were at piquet, and
Mrs. Hurst was observing their game.

<p/>Elizabeth took up some needlework, and was sufficiently amused in
attending to what passed between Darcy and his (<font color='blue'><b>Darcy</b></font>) companion. The perpetual
commendations of the lady, either on his (<font color='blue'><b>Darcy</b></font>) handwriting, or on the evenness
of his (<font color='blue'><b>Darcy</b></font>) lines, or on the length of his (<font color='blue'><b>Darcy</b></font>) letter, with the perfect unconcern
with which her (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) praises were received, formed a curious dialogue, and was
exactly in union with her (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) opinion of each.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``How delighted Miss Darcy will be to receive such a letter!''

 (<font color='red'><b>He</b></font>)</div><p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Darcy</b></font>) made no answer.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``You write uncommonly fast.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``You are mistaken. I write rather slowly.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``How many letters you must have occasion to write in the course of a
year! Letters of business, too! How odious I should think them!''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``It is fortunate, then, that they fall to my lot instead of yours.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Pray tell your sister that I long to see her (<font color='blue'><b>sister</b></font>).''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I have already told her (<font color='blue'><b>sister</b></font>) so once, by your desire.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I am afraid you do not like your pen. Let me mend it for you. I mend
pens remarkably well.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Thank you--but I always mend my own.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``How can you contrive to write so even?''

 (<font color='red'><b>He</b></font>)</div><p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Darcy</b></font>) was silent.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Tell your sister I am delighted to hear of her (<font color='blue'><b>sister</b></font>) improvement on the harp;
and pray let her (<font color='blue'><b>sister</b></font>) know that I am quite in raptures with her (<font color='blue'><b>sister</b></font>) beautiful
little design for a table, and I think it infinitely superior to Miss
Grantley's.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Will you give me leave to defer your raptures till I write again? At
present I have not room to do them justice.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Oh! it is of no consequence. I shall see her (<font color='blue'><b>sister</b></font>) in January. But do you
always write such charming long letters to her (<font color='blue'><b>sister</b></font>), Mr. Darcy?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``They are generally long; but whether always charming it is not for me
to determine.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``It is a rule with me, that a person who can write a long letter with
ease, cannot write ill.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``That will not do for a compliment to Darcy, Caroline,''  (<font color='red'><b>brother</b></font>)</div>cried her (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>)
brother, <div class="bookquote">``because he (<font color='blue'><b>Darcy</b></font>) does _not_ write with ease. He (<font color='blue'><b>Darcy</b></font>) studies too much for
words of four syllables. Do not you, Darcy?''

 (<font color='red'><b>brother</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``My style of writing is very different from yours.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Oh!''  (<font color='red'><b>Miss Bingley</b></font>)</div>cried Miss Bingley, <div class="bookquote">``Charles writes in the most careless way
imaginable. He (<font color='blue'><b>Charles</b></font>) leaves out half his (<font color='blue'><b>Charles</b></font>) words, and blots the rest.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Miss Bingley</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``My ideas flow so rapidly that I have not time to express them--by which
means my letters sometimes convey no ideas at all to my correspondents.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Your humility, Mr. Bingley,''  (<font color='red'><b>Elizabeth/Miss Bennet/Miss Elizabeth</b></font>)</div>said Elizabeth, <div class="bookquote">``must disarm reproof.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Elizabeth/Miss Bennet/Miss Elizabeth</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Nothing is more deceitful,''  (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Darcy/Darcy</b></font>)</div>said Darcy, <div class="bookquote">``than the appearance of
humility. It is often only carelessness of opinion, and sometimes an
indirect boast.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Darcy/Darcy</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``And which of the two do you call _my_ little recent piece of modesty?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``The indirect boast; for you are really proud of your defects in
writing, because you consider them as proceeding from a rapidity of
thought and carelessness of execution, which, if not estimable, you
think at least highly interesting. The power of doing anything with
quickness is always prized much by the possessor, and often without any
attention to the imperfection of the performance. When you told Mrs.
Bennet this morning that if you ever resolved upon quitting Netherfield
you should be gone in five minutes, you meant it to be a sort of
panegyric, of compliment to yourself--and yet what is there so very
laudable in a precipitance which must leave very necessary business
undone, and can be of no real advantage to yourself or anyone else?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Nay,''  (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Bingley/Bingley</b></font>)</div>cried Bingley, <div class="bookquote">``this is too much, to remember at night all the
foolish things that were said in the morning. And yet, upon my honour,
I believe what I said of myself to be true, and I believe it at this
moment. At least, therefore, I did not assume the character of needless
precipitance merely to show off before the ladies.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Bingley/Bingley</b></font>)</div><p/>``I dare say you believed it; but I am by no means convinced that
you would be gone with such celerity. Your conduct would be quite as
dependent on chance as that of any man I know; and if, as you were
mounting your horse, a friend were to say, ``Bingley, you had better
stay till next week,<div class="bookquote">'' you would probably do it, you would probably not
go--and at another word, might stay a month.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Bingley</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``You have only proved by this,''  (<font color='red'><b>Elizabeth/Miss Bennet/Miss Elizabeth</b></font>)</div>cried Elizabeth, <div class="bookquote">``that Mr. Bingley did
not do justice to his (<font color='blue'><b>Bingley</b></font>) own disposition. You have shown him (<font color='blue'><b>Bingley</b></font>) off now much
more than he (<font color='blue'><b>Bingley</b></font>) did himself.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Elizabeth/Miss Bennet/Miss Elizabeth</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I am exceedingly gratified,''  (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Bingley/Bingley</b></font>)</div>said Bingley, <div class="bookquote">``by your converting what my
friend says into a compliment on the sweetness of my temper. But I am
afraid you are giving it a turn which that gentleman did by no means
intend; for he (<font color='blue'><b>gentleman</b></font>) would certainly think better of me, if under such a
circumstance I were to give a flat denial, and ride off as fast as I
could.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Bingley/Bingley</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Would Mr. Darcy then consider the rashness of your original intentions
as atoned for by your obstinacy in adhering to it?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Upon my word, I cannot exactly explain the matter; Darcy must speak for
himself.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``You expect me to account for opinions which you choose to call mine,
but which I have never acknowledged. Allowing the case, however, to
stand according to your representation, you must remember, Miss Bennet,
that the friend who is supposed to desire his (<font color='blue'><b>friend</b></font>) return to the house, and
the delay of his (<font color='blue'><b>friend</b></font>) plan, has merely desired it, asked it without offering
one argument in favour of its propriety.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``To yield readily--easily--to the _persuasion_ of a friend is no merit
with you.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``To yield without conviction is no compliment to the understanding of
either.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``You appear to me, Mr. Darcy, to allow nothing for the influence of
friendship and affection. A regard for the requester would often make
one readily yield to a request, without waiting for arguments to reason
one into it. I am not particularly speaking of such a case as you have
supposed about Mr. Bingley. We may as well wait, perhaps, till the
circumstance occurs before we discuss the discretion of his (<font color='blue'><b>Bingley</b></font>) behaviour
thereupon. But in general and ordinary cases between friend and friend,
where one of them is desired by the other to change a resolution of no
very great moment, should you think ill of that person for complying
with the desire, without waiting to be argued into it?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Will it not be advisable, before we proceed on this subject, to
arrange with rather more precision the degree of importance which is to
appertain to this request, as well as the degree of intimacy subsisting
between the parties?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``By all means,''  (<font color='red'><b>Bingley</b></font>)</div>cried Bingley; <div class="bookquote">``let us hear all the particulars, not
forgetting their comparative height and size; for that will have more
weight in the argument, Miss Bennet, than you may be aware of. I assure
you, that if Darcy were not such a great tall fellow, in comparison with
myself, I should not pay him (<font color='blue'><b>Darcy</b></font>) half so much deference. I declare I do not
know a more awful object than Darcy, on particular occasions, and in
particular places; at his (<font color='blue'><b>Darcy</b></font>) own house especially, and of a Sunday evening,
when he (<font color='blue'><b>Darcy</b></font>) has nothing to do.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Bingley</b></font>)</div><p/>Mr. Darcy smiled; but Elizabeth thought she (<font color='blue'><b>Elizabeth</b></font>) could perceive that he (<font color='blue'><b>Darcy</b></font>) was
rather offended, and therefore checked her (<font color='blue'><b>Elizabeth</b></font>) laugh. Miss Bingley warmly
resented the indignity he (<font color='blue'><b>Darcy</b></font>) had received, in an expostulation with her (<font color='blue'><b>Bingley</b></font>)
brother for talking such nonsense.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``I see your design, Bingley,''  (<font color='red'><b>friend</b></font>)</div>said his (<font color='blue'><b>Darcy</b></font>) friend. <div class="bookquote">``You dislike an argument,
and want to silence this.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Perhaps I do. Arguments are too much like disputes. If you and Miss
Bennet will defer yours till I am out of the room, I shall be very
thankful; and then you may say whatever you like of me.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``What you ask,''  (<font color='red'><b>Elizabeth/Miss Bennet/Miss Elizabeth</b></font>)</div>said Elizabeth, <div class="bookquote">``is no sacrifice on my side; and Mr.
Darcy had much better finish his (<font color='blue'><b>Darcy</b></font>) letter.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Elizabeth/Miss Bennet/Miss Elizabeth</b></font>)</div><p/>Mr. Darcy took her (<font color='blue'><b>Elizabeth</b></font>) advice, and did finish his (<font color='blue'><b>Darcy</b></font>) letter.

<p/>When that business was over, he (<font color='blue'><b>Darcy</b></font>) applied to Miss Bingley and Elizabeth
for an indulgence of some music. Miss Bingley moved with some alacrity
to the pianoforte; and, after a polite request that Elizabeth would lead
the way which the other as politely and more earnestly negatived, she (<font color='blue'><b>Elizabeth</b></font>)
seated herself.

<p/>Mrs. Hurst sang with her (<font color='blue'><b>Hurst</b></font>) sister, and while they were thus employed,
Elizabeth could not help observing, as she (<font color='blue'><b>Elizabeth</b></font>) turned over some music-books
that lay on the instrument, how frequently Mr. Darcy's eyes were fixed
on her (<font color='blue'><b>Elizabeth</b></font>). She (<font color='blue'><b>Elizabeth</b></font>) hardly knew how to suppose that she (<font color='blue'><b>Elizabeth</b></font>) could be an object of
admiration to so great a man; and yet that he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) should look at her (<font color='blue'><b>Elizabeth</b></font>)
because he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) disliked her (<font color='blue'><b>Elizabeth</b></font>), was still more strange. She (<font color='blue'><b>Elizabeth</b></font>) could only imagine,
however, at last that she (<font color='blue'><b>Elizabeth</b></font>) drew his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) notice because there was something
more wrong and reprehensible, according to his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) ideas of right, than in
any other person present. The supposition did not pain her (<font color='blue'><b>Elizabeth</b></font>). She (<font color='blue'><b>Elizabeth</b></font>) liked
him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) too little to care for his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) approbation.

<p/>After playing some Italian songs, Miss Bingley varied the charm by
a lively Scotch air; and soon afterwards Mr. Darcy, drawing near
Elizabeth, said to her (<font color='blue'><b>Elizabeth</b></font>):

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Do not you feel a great inclination, Miss Bennet, to seize such an
opportunity of dancing a reel?''

 (<font color='red'><b>Elizabeth/Miss Bennet/Miss Elizabeth</b></font>)</div><p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>Elizabeth</b></font>) smiled, but made no answer. He (<font color='blue'><b>Darcy</b></font>) repeated the question, with some
surprise at her (<font color='blue'><b>Elizabeth</b></font>) silence.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Oh!''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>said she (<font color='blue'><b>Elizabeth</b></font>), ``I heard you before, but I could not immediately
determine what to say in reply. You wanted me, I know, to say ``Yes,<div class="bookquote">''
that you might have the pleasure of despising my taste; but I always
delight in overthrowing those kind of schemes, and cheating a person of
their premeditated contempt. I have, therefore, made up my mind to tell
you, that I do not want to dance a reel at all--and now despise me if
you dare.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Indeed I do not dare.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Elizabeth/Miss Bennet/Miss Elizabeth</b></font>)</div><p/>Elizabeth, having rather expected to affront him (<font color='blue'><b>Darcy</b></font>), was amazed at his (<font color='blue'><b>Darcy</b></font>)
gallantry; but there was a mixture of sweetness and archness in her (<font color='blue'><b>Elizabeth</b></font>)
manner which made it difficult for her (<font color='blue'><b>Elizabeth</b></font>) to affront anybody; and Darcy
had never been so bewitched by any woman as he (<font color='blue'><b>Darcy</b></font>) was by her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>). He (<font color='blue'><b>Darcy</b></font>) really
believed, that were it not for the inferiority of her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) connections, he (<font color='blue'><b>Darcy</b></font>)
should be in some danger.

<p/>Miss Bingley saw, or suspected enough to be jealous; and her (<font color='blue'><b>Bingley</b></font>) great
anxiety for the recovery of her (<font color='blue'><b>Bingley</b></font>) dear friend Jane received some
assistance from her (<font color='blue'><b>Jane</b></font>) desire of getting rid of Elizabeth.

<p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>Elizabeth</b></font>) often tried to provoke Darcy into disliking her (<font color='blue'><b>Elizabeth</b></font>) guest, by talking of
their supposed marriage, and planning his (<font color='blue'><b>Darcy</b></font>) happiness in such an alliance.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``I hope,''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>said she (<font color='blue'><b>Elizabeth</b></font>), as they were walking together in the shrubbery
the next day, <div class="bookquote">``you will give your mother-in-law a few hints, when this
desirable event takes place, as to the advantage of holding her (<font color='blue'><b>mother-in-law</b></font>) tongue;
and if you can compass it, do cure the younger girls of running after
officers. And, if I may mention so delicate a subject, endeavour to
check that little something, bordering on conceit and impertinence,
which your lady possesses.''

 (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Have you anything else to propose for my domestic felicity?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Oh! yes. Do let the portraits of your uncle and aunt Phillips be placed
in the gallery at Pemberley. Put them next to your great-uncle the
judge. They are in the same profession, you know, only in different
lines. As for your Elizabeth's picture, you must not have it taken, for
what painter could do justice to those beautiful eyes?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``It would not be easy, indeed, to catch their expression, but their
colour and shape, and the eyelashes, so remarkably fine, might be
copied.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Mrs. Hurst</b></font>)</div><p/>At that moment they were met from another walk by Mrs. Hurst and
Elizabeth herself.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``I did not know that you intended to walk,''  (<font color='red'><b>Miss Bingley</b></font>)</div>said Miss Bingley, in some
confusion, lest they had been overheard.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``You used us abominably ill,''  (<font color='red'><b>Mrs. Hurst</b></font>)</div>answered Mrs. Hurst, <div class="bookquote">``running away without
telling us that you were coming out.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Mrs. Hurst</b></font>)</div><p/>Then taking the disengaged arm of Mr. Darcy, she (<font color='blue'><b>Hurst</b></font>) left Elizabeth to walk
by herself. The path just admitted three. Mr. Darcy felt their rudeness,
and immediately said:

<p/><div class="bookquote">``This walk is not wide enough for our party. We had better go into the
avenue.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Darcy/Darcy</b></font>)</div><p/>But Elizabeth, who had not the least inclination to remain with them,
laughingly answered:

<p/><div class="bookquote">``No, no; stay where you are. You are charmingly grouped, and appear
to uncommon advantage. The picturesque would be spoilt by admitting a
fourth. Good-bye.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Elizabeth/Miss Bennet/Miss Elizabeth</b></font>)</div><p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>Elizabeth</b></font>) then ran gaily off, rejoicing as she (<font color='blue'><b>Elizabeth</b></font>) rambled about, in the hope of
being at home again in a day or two. Jane was already so much recovered
as to intend leaving her (<font color='blue'><b>Jane</b></font>) room for a couple of hours that evening.



<p/>Chapter 11


<p/>When the ladies removed after dinner, Elizabeth ran up to her (<font color='blue'><b>Elizabeth</b></font>)
sister, and seeing her (<font color='blue'><b>Elizabeth</b></font>) well guarded from cold, attended her (<font color='blue'><b>Elizabeth</b></font>) into the
drawing-room, where she (<font color='blue'><b>Elizabeth</b></font>) was welcomed by her (<font color='blue'><b>Elizabeth</b></font>) two friends with many
professions of pleasure; and Elizabeth had never seen them so agreeable
as they were during the hour which passed before the gentlemen appeared.
Their powers of conversation were considerable. They could describe an
entertainment with accuracy, relate an anecdote with humour, and laugh
at their acquaintance with spirit.

<p/>But when the gentlemen entered, Jane was no longer the first object;
Miss Bingley's eyes were instantly turned toward Darcy, and she (<font color='blue'><b>Bingley</b></font>) had
something to say to him (<font color='blue'><b>Darcy</b></font>) before he (<font color='blue'><b>Darcy</b></font>) had advanced many steps. He (<font color='blue'><b>Darcy</b></font>) addressed
himself to Miss Bennet, with a polite congratulation; Mr. Hurst also
made her (<font color='blue'><b>Bennet</b></font>) a slight bow, and said he (<font color='blue'><b>Hurst</b></font>) was <div class="bookquote">``very glad;''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>but diffuseness
and warmth remained for Bingley's salutation. He (<font color='blue'><b>Bingley</b></font>) was full of joy and
attention. The first half-hour was spent in piling up the fire, lest she (<font color='blue'><b>Bennet</b></font>)
should suffer from the change of room; and she (<font color='blue'><b>Bennet</b></font>) removed at his (<font color='blue'><b>Bingley</b></font>) desire
to the other side of the fireplace, that she (<font color='blue'><b>Bennet</b></font>) might be further from
the door. He (<font color='blue'><b>Bingley</b></font>) then sat down by her (<font color='blue'><b>Bennet</b></font>), and talked scarcely to anyone
else. Elizabeth, at work in the opposite corner, saw it all with great
delight.

<p/>When tea was over, Mr. Hurst reminded his (<font color='blue'><b>Hurst</b></font>) sister-in-law of the
card-table--but in vain. She (<font color='blue'><b>sister-in-law</b></font>) had obtained private intelligence that Mr.
Darcy did not wish for cards; and Mr. Hurst soon found even his (<font color='blue'><b>Hurst</b></font>) open
petition rejected. She (<font color='blue'><b>sister-in-law</b></font>) assured him (<font color='blue'><b>Hurst</b></font>) that no one intended to play, and
the silence of the whole party on the subject seemed to justify her (<font color='blue'><b>sister-in-law</b></font>). Mr.
Hurst had therefore nothing to do, but to stretch himself on one of the
sofas and go to sleep. Darcy took up a book; Miss Bingley did the same;
and Mrs. Hurst, principally occupied in playing with her (<font color='blue'><b>Hurst</b></font>) bracelets
and rings, joined now and then in her (<font color='blue'><b>Hurst</b></font>) brother's conversation with Miss
Bennet.

<p/>Miss Bingley's attention was quite as much engaged in watching Mr.
Darcy's progress through _his (<font color='blue'><b>Darcy</b></font>)_ book, as in reading her (<font color='blue'><b>Bingley</b></font>) own; and she (<font color='blue'><b>Bingley</b></font>)
was perpetually either making some inquiry, or looking at his (<font color='blue'><b>Darcy</b></font>) page. She (<font color='blue'><b>Bingley</b></font>)
could not win him (<font color='blue'><b>Darcy</b></font>), however, to any conversation; he (<font color='blue'><b>Darcy</b></font>) merely answered her (<font color='blue'><b>Bingley</b></font>)
question, and read on. At length, quite exhausted by the attempt to be
amused with her (<font color='blue'><b>Bingley</b></font>) own book, which she (<font color='blue'><b>Bingley</b></font>) had only chosen because it was the
second volume of his (<font color='blue'><b>Darcy</b></font>), she (<font color='blue'><b>Bingley</b></font>) gave a great yawn and said, <div class="bookquote">``How pleasant
it is to spend an evening in this way! I declare after all there is no
enjoyment like reading! How much sooner one tires of anything than of a
book! When I have a house of my own, I shall be miserable if I have not
an excellent library.''

 (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div><p/>No one made any reply. She (<font color='blue'><b>Bingley</b></font>) then yawned again, threw aside her (<font color='blue'><b>Bingley</b></font>) book, and
cast her (<font color='blue'><b>Bingley</b></font>) eyes round the room in quest for some amusement; when hearing
her (<font color='blue'><b>Bingley</b></font>) brother mentioning a ball to Miss Bennet, she (<font color='blue'><b>Bennet</b></font>) turned suddenly
towards him (<font color='blue'><b>brother</b></font>) and said:

<p/><div class="bookquote">``By the bye, Charles, are you really serious in meditating a dance at
Netherfield? I would advise you, before you determine on it, to consult
the wishes of the present party; I am much mistaken if there are
not some among us to whom a ball would be rather a punishment than a
pleasure.''

 (<font color='red'><b>him</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``If you mean Darcy,''  (<font color='red'><b>brother</b></font>)</div>cried her (<font color='blue'><b>Bennet</b></font>) brother, <div class="bookquote">``he (<font color='blue'><b>Darcy</b></font>) may go to bed, if he (<font color='blue'><b>Darcy</b></font>)
chooses, before it begins--but as for the ball, it is quite a settled
thing; and as soon as Nicholls has made white soup enough, I shall send
round my cards.''

 (<font color='red'><b>brother</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I should like balls infinitely better,''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Bennet</b></font>) replied, <div class="bookquote">``if they were
carried on in a different manner; but there is something insufferably
tedious in the usual process of such a meeting. It would surely be much
more rational if conversation instead of dancing were made the order of
the day.''

 (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Much more rational, my dear Caroline, I dare say, but it would not be
near so much like a ball.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Miss Bingley</b></font>)</div><p/>Miss Bingley made no answer, and soon afterwards she (<font color='blue'><b>Bingley</b></font>) got up and walked
about the room. Her (<font color='blue'><b>Bingley</b></font>) figure was elegant, and she (<font color='blue'><b>Bingley</b></font>) walked well; but
Darcy, at whom it was all aimed, was still inflexibly studious. In
the desperation of her (<font color='blue'><b>Bingley</b></font>) feelings, she (<font color='blue'><b>Bingley</b></font>) resolved on one effort more, and,
turning to Elizabeth, said:

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Miss Eliza Bennet, let me persuade you to follow my example, and take a
turn about the room. I assure you it is very refreshing after sitting so
long in one attitude.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Elizabeth/Miss Bennet/Miss Elizabeth</b></font>)</div><p/>Elizabeth was surprised, but agreed to it immediately. Miss Bingley
succeeded no less in the real object of her (<font color='blue'><b>Bingley</b></font>) civility; Mr. Darcy looked
up. He (<font color='blue'><b>Darcy</b></font>) was as much awake to the novelty of attention in that quarter as
Elizabeth herself could be, and unconsciously closed his (<font color='blue'><b>Darcy</b></font>) book. He (<font color='blue'><b>Darcy</b></font>) was
directly invited to join their party, but he (<font color='blue'><b>Darcy</b></font>) declined it, observing that
he (<font color='blue'><b>Darcy</b></font>) could imagine but two motives for their choosing to walk up and down
the room together, with either of which motives his (<font color='blue'><b>Darcy</b></font>) joining them would
interfere. <div class="bookquote">``What could he (<font color='blue'><b>me</b></font>) mean? She (<font color='blue'><b>Bennet</b></font>) was dying to know what could be his (<font color='blue'><b>me</b></font>)
meaning?'' (<font color='red'><b>Elizabeth/Miss Bennet/Miss Elizabeth</b></font>)</div>--and asked Elizabeth whether she (<font color='blue'><b>Elizabeth</b></font>) could at all understand him (<font color='blue'><b>Darcy</b></font>)?

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Not at all,''  (<font color='red'><b>Miss Bingley</b></font>)</div>was her (<font color='blue'><b>Elizabeth</b></font>) answer; <div class="bookquote">``but depend upon it, he (<font color='blue'><b>me</b></font>) means to be severe
on us, and our surest way of disappointing him (<font color='blue'><b>me</b></font>) will be to ask nothing
about it.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Miss Bingley</b></font>)</div><p/>Miss Bingley, however, was incapable of disappointing Mr. Darcy in
anything, and persevered therefore in requiring an explanation of his (<font color='blue'><b>Darcy</b></font>)
two motives.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``I have not the smallest objection to explaining them,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>said he (<font color='blue'><b>Darcy</b></font>), as soon
as she (<font color='blue'><b>Bingley</b></font>) allowed him (<font color='blue'><b>Darcy</b></font>) to speak. <div class="bookquote">``You either choose this method of passing
the evening because you are in each other's confidence, and have secret
affairs to discuss, or because you are conscious that your figures
appear to the greatest advantage in walking; if the first, I would be
completely in your way, and if the second, I can admire you much better
as I sit by the fire.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Oh! shocking!''  (<font color='red'><b>Miss Bingley</b></font>)</div>cried Miss Bingley. <div class="bookquote">``I never heard anything so
abominable. How shall we punish him (<font color='blue'><b>I</b></font>) for such a speech?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Nothing so easy, if you have but the inclination,''  (<font color='red'><b>Elizabeth/Miss Bennet/Miss Elizabeth</b></font>)</div>said Elizabeth. <div class="bookquote">``We
can all plague and punish one another. Tease him (<font color='blue'><b>I</b></font>)--laugh at him (<font color='blue'><b>I</b></font>). Intimate
as you are, you must know how it is to be done.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``But upon my honour, I do _not_. I do assure you that my intimacy has
not yet taught me _that_. Tease calmness of manner and presence of
mind! No, no; I feel he (<font color='blue'><b>I</b></font>) may defy us there. And as to laughter, we will
not expose ourselves, if you please, by attempting to laugh without a
subject. Mr. Darcy may hug himself.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Mr. Darcy is not to be laughed at!''  (<font color='red'><b>Elizabeth/Miss Bennet/Miss Elizabeth</b></font>)</div>cried Elizabeth. <div class="bookquote">``That is an
uncommon advantage, and uncommon I hope it will continue, for it would
be a great loss to _me_ to have many such acquaintances. I dearly love a
laugh.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Miss Bingley,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>said he (<font color='blue'><b>Darcy</b></font>), <div class="bookquote">``has given me more credit than can be.
The wisest and the best of men--nay, the wisest and best of their
actions--may be rendered ridiculous by a person whose first object in
life is a joke.''

 (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Certainly,''  (<font color='red'><b>Elizabeth/Miss Bennet/Miss Elizabeth</b></font>)</div>replied Elizabeth--<div class="bookquote">``there are such people, but I hope I
am not one of _them_. I hope I never ridicule what is wise and good.
Follies and nonsense, whims and inconsistencies, _do_ divert me, I own,
and I laugh at them whenever I can. But these, I suppose, are precisely
what you are without.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Elizabeth/Miss Bennet/Miss Elizabeth</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Perhaps that is not possible for anyone. But it has been the study
of my life to avoid those weaknesses which often expose a strong
understanding to ridicule.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Such as vanity and pride.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Yes, vanity is a weakness indeed. But pride--where there is a real
superiority of mind, pride will be always under good regulation.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Elizabeth/Miss Bennet/Miss Elizabeth</b></font>)</div><p/>Elizabeth turned away to hide a smile.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Your examination of Mr. Darcy is over, I presume,''  (<font color='red'><b>Miss Bingley</b></font>)</div>said Miss Bingley;
<div class="bookquote">``and pray what is the result?''

 (<font color='red'><b>Miss Bingley</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I am perfectly convinced by it that Mr. Darcy has no defect. He (<font color='blue'><b>Darcy</b></font>) owns it
himself without disguise.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``No,''  (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Darcy/Darcy</b></font>)</div>said Darcy, <div class="bookquote">``I have made no such pretension. I have faults enough,
but they are not, I hope, of understanding. My temper I dare not vouch
for. It is, I believe, too little yielding--certainly too little for the
convenience of the world. I cannot forget the follies and vices of others
so soon as I ought, nor their offenses against myself. My feelings
are not puffed about with every attempt to move them. My temper
would perhaps be called resentful. My good opinion once lost, is lost
forever.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Darcy/Darcy</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">''_That_ is a failing indeed!''  (<font color='red'><b>Elizabeth/Miss Bennet/Miss Elizabeth</b></font>)</div>cried Elizabeth. <div class="bookquote">``Implacable resentment
_is_ a shade in a character. But you have chosen your fault well. I
really cannot _laugh_ at it. You are safe from me.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``There is, I believe, in every disposition a tendency to some particular
evil--a natural defect, which not even the best education can overcome.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``And _your_ defect is to hate everybody.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``And yours,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Darcy</b></font>) replied with a smile, <div class="bookquote">``is willfully to misunderstand
them.''

 (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Do let us have a little music,''  (<font color='red'><b>Miss Bingley</b></font>)</div>cried Miss Bingley, tired of a
conversation in which she (<font color='blue'><b>Bingley</b></font>) had no share. <div class="bookquote">``Louisa, you will not mind my
waking Mr. Hurst?''

 (<font color='red'><b>sister</b></font>)</div><p/>Her (<font color='blue'><b>Bingley</b></font>) sister had not the smallest objection, and the pianoforte was
opened; and Darcy, after a few moments' recollection, was not sorry for
it. He (<font color='blue'><b>Darcy</b></font>) began to feel the danger of paying Elizabeth too much attention.



<p/>Chapter 12


<p/>In consequence of an agreement between the sisters, Elizabeth wrote the
next morning to their mother, to beg that the carriage might be sent for
them in the course of the day. But Mrs. Bennet, who had calculated on
her (<font color='blue'><b>Bennet</b></font>) daughters remaining at Netherfield till the following Tuesday, which
would exactly finish Jane's week, could not bring herself to receive
them with pleasure before. Her (<font color='blue'><b>Jane</b></font>) answer, therefore, was not propitious, at
least not to Elizabeth's wishes, for she (<font color='blue'><b>Elizabeth</b></font>) was impatient to get home. Mrs.
Bennet sent them word that they could not possibly have the carriage
before Tuesday; and in her (<font color='blue'><b>Bennet</b></font>) postscript it was added, that if Mr. Bingley
and his (<font color='blue'><b>Bingley</b></font>) sister pressed them to stay longer, she (<font color='blue'><b>Bennet</b></font>) could spare them
very well. Against staying longer, however, Elizabeth was positively
resolved--nor did she (<font color='blue'><b>Elizabeth</b></font>) much expect it would be asked; and fearful, on the
contrary, as being considered as intruding themselves needlessly long,
she (<font color='blue'><b>Elizabeth</b></font>) urged Jane to borrow Mr. Bingley's carriage immediately, and at
length it was settled that their original design of leaving Netherfield
that morning should be mentioned, and the request made.

<p/>The communication excited many professions of concern; and enough was
said of wishing them to stay at least till the following day to work
on Jane; and till the morrow their going was deferred. Miss Bingley was
then sorry that she (<font color='blue'><b>Bingley</b></font>) had proposed the delay, for her (<font color='blue'><b>Bingley</b></font>) jealousy and dislike
of one sister much exceeded her (<font color='blue'><b>Bingley</b></font>) affection for the other.

<p/>The master of the house heard with real sorrow that they were to go so
soon, and repeatedly tried to persuade Miss Bennet that it would not be
safe for her (<font color='blue'><b>Bennet</b></font>)--that she (<font color='blue'><b>Bennet</b></font>) was not enough recovered; but Jane was firm where
she (<font color='blue'><b>Jane</b></font>) felt herself to be right.

<p/>To Mr. Darcy it was welcome intelligence--Elizabeth had been at
Netherfield long enough. She (<font color='blue'><b>Elizabeth</b></font>) attracted him (<font color='blue'><b>Darcy</b></font>) more than he (<font color='blue'><b>Darcy</b></font>) liked--and Miss
Bingley was uncivil to _her (<font color='blue'><b>Bingley</b></font>)_, and more teasing than usual to himself.
He (<font color='blue'><b>Darcy</b></font>) wisely resolved to be particularly careful that no sign of admiration
should _now_ escape him (<font color='blue'><b>Darcy</b></font>), nothing that could elevate her (<font color='blue'><b>Bingley</b></font>) with the hope
of influencing his (<font color='blue'><b>Darcy</b></font>) felicity; sensible that if such an idea had been
suggested, his (<font color='blue'><b>Darcy</b></font>) behaviour during the last day must have material weight
in confirming or crushing it. Steady to his (<font color='blue'><b>Darcy</b></font>) purpose, he (<font color='blue'><b>Darcy</b></font>) scarcely spoke
ten words to her (<font color='blue'><b>Bingley</b></font>) through the whole of Saturday, and though they were
at one time left by themselves for half-an-hour, he (<font color='blue'><b>Darcy</b></font>) adhered most
conscientiously to his (<font color='blue'><b>Darcy</b></font>) book, and would not even look at her (<font color='blue'><b>Bingley</b></font>).

<p/>On Sunday, after morning service, the separation, so agreeable to almost
all, took place. Miss Bingley's civility to Elizabeth increased at last
very rapidly, as well as her (<font color='blue'><b>Elizabeth</b></font>) affection for Jane; and when they parted,
after assuring the latter of the pleasure it would always give her (<font color='blue'><b>Jane</b></font>)
to see her (<font color='blue'><b>Jane</b></font>) either at Longbourn or Netherfield, and embracing her (<font color='blue'><b>Jane</b></font>) most
tenderly, she (<font color='blue'><b>Jane</b></font>) even shook hands with the former. Elizabeth took leave of
the whole party in the liveliest of spirits.

<p/>They were not welcomed home very cordially by their mother. Mrs. Bennet
wondered at their coming, and thought them very wrong to give so much
trouble, and was sure Jane would have caught cold again. But their
father, though very laconic in his (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) expressions of pleasure, was really
glad to see them; he (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) had felt their importance in the family circle. The
evening conversation, when they were all assembled, had lost much of
its animation, and almost all its sense by the absence of Jane and
Elizabeth.

<p/>They found Mary, as usual, deep in the study of thorough-bass and human
nature; and had some extracts to admire, and some new observations of
threadbare morality to listen to. Catherine and Lydia had information
for them of a different sort. Much had been done and much had been said
in the regiment since the preceding Wednesday; several of the officers
had dined lately with their uncle, a private had been flogged, and it
had actually been hinted that Colonel Forster was going to be married.



<p/>Chapter 13


<p/><div class="bookquote">``I hope, my dear,''  (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Bennet</b></font>)</div>said Mr. Bennet to his (<font color='blue'><b>Bennet</b></font>) wife, as they were at

because I have reason to expect an addition to our family party.''

 (<font color='red'><b>wife</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Who do you mean, my dear? I know of nobody that is coming, I am sure,
unless Charlotte Lucas should happen to call in--and I hope _my_ dinners
are good enough for her (<font color='blue'><b>Lucas</b></font>). I do not believe she (<font color='blue'><b>Lucas</b></font>) often sees such at home.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``The person of whom I speak is a gentleman, and a stranger.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Mrs. Bennet</b></font>)</div><p/>Mrs. Bennet's eyes sparkled. <div class="bookquote">``A gentleman and a stranger! It is Mr.
Bingley, I am sure! Well, I am sure I shall be extremely glad to see Mr.
Bingley. But--good Lord! how unlucky! There is not a bit of fish to be
got to-day. Lydia, my love, ring the bell--I must speak to Hill this
moment.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``It is _not_ Mr. Bingley,''  (<font color='red'><b>husband</b></font>)</div>said her (<font color='blue'><b>Bennet</b></font>) husband; <div class="bookquote">``it is a person whom I
never saw in the whole course of my life.''

 (<font color='red'><b>husband</b></font>)</div><p/>This roused a general astonishment; and he (<font color='blue'><b>husband</b></font>) had the pleasure of being
eagerly questioned by his (<font color='blue'><b>husband</b></font>) wife and his (<font color='blue'><b>husband</b></font>) five daughters at once.

<p/>After amusing himself some time with their curiosity, he (<font color='blue'><b>husband</b></font>) thus explained:

<p/><div class="bookquote">``About a month ago I received this letter; and about a fortnight ago
I answered it, for I thought it a case of some delicacy, and requiring
early attention. It is from my cousin, Mr. Collins, who, when I am dead,
may turn you all out of this house as soon as he (<font color='blue'><b>Collins</b></font>) pleases.''

 (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Oh! my dear,''  (<font color='red'><b>wife</b></font>)</div>cried his (<font color='blue'><b>husband</b></font>) wife, <div class="bookquote">``I cannot bear to hear that mentioned.
Pray do not talk of that odious man. I do think it is the hardest thing
in the world, that your estate should be entailed away from your own
children; and I am sure, if I had been you, I should have tried long ago
to do something or other about it.''

 (<font color='red'><b>wife</b></font>)</div><p/>Jane and Elizabeth tried to explain to her (<font color='blue'><b>Jane</b></font>) the nature of an entail. They
had often attempted to do it before, but it was a subject on which
Mrs. Bennet was beyond the reach of reason, and she (<font color='blue'><b>Bennet</b></font>) continued to rail
bitterly against the cruelty of settling an estate away from a family of
five daughters, in favour of a man whom nobody cared anything about.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``It certainly is a most iniquitous affair,''  (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Bennet</b></font>)</div>said Mr. Bennet, <div class="bookquote">``and
nothing can clear Mr. Collins from the guilt of inheriting Longbourn.
But if you will listen to his (<font color='blue'><b>Collins</b></font>) letter, you may perhaps be a little
softened by his (<font color='blue'><b>Collins</b></font>) manner of expressing himself.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Bennet</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``No, that I am sure I shall not; and I think it is very impertinent of
him (<font color='blue'><b>Collins</b></font>) to write to you at all, and very hypocritical. I hate such false
friends. Why could he (<font color='blue'><b>Collins</b></font>) not keep on quarreling with you, as his (<font color='blue'><b>Collins</b></font>) father did
before him (<font color='blue'><b>Collins</b></font>)?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Why, indeed; he (<font color='blue'><b>Collins</b></font>) does seem to have had some filial scruples on that
head, as you will hear.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/>``Hunsford, near Westerham, Kent, 15th October.

<p/>``Dear Sir,--

<p/>``The disagreement subsisting between yourself and my late honoured
father always gave me much uneasiness, and since I have had the
misfortune to lose him (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>), I have frequently wished to heal the breach; but
for some time I was kept back by my own doubts, fearing lest it might
seem disrespectful to his (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) memory for me to be on good terms with anyone
with whom it had always pleased him (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) to be at variance.--<div class="bookquote">``There, Mrs.
Bennet.'' (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>--My mind, however, is now made up on the subject, for having
received ordination at Easter, I have been so fortunate as to be
distinguished by the patronage of the Right Honourable Lady Catherine de
Bourgh, widow of Sir Lewis de Bourgh, whose bounty and beneficence has
preferred me to the valuable rectory of this parish, where it shall be
my earnest endeavour to demean myself with grateful respect towards her (<font color='blue'><b>Bourgh</b></font>)
ladyship, and be ever ready to perform those rites and ceremonies which
are instituted by the Church of England. As a clergyman, moreover, I
feel it my duty to promote and establish the blessing of peace in
all families within the reach of my influence; and on these grounds I
flatter myself that my present overtures are highly commendable, and
that the circumstance of my being next in the entail of Longbourn estate
will be kindly overlooked on your side, and not lead you to reject the
offered olive-branch. I cannot be otherwise than concerned at being the
means of injuring your amiable daughters, and beg leave to apologise for
it, as well as to assure you of my readiness to make them every possible
amends--but of this hereafter. If you should have no objection to
receive me into your house, I propose myself the satisfaction of waiting
on you and your family, Monday, November 18th, by four o'clock, and
shall probably trespass on your hospitality till the Saturday se'ennight
following, which I can do without any inconvenience, as Lady Catherine
is far from objecting to my occasional absence on a Sunday, provided
that some other clergyman is engaged to do the duty of the day.--I
remain, dear sir, with respectful compliments to your lady and
daughters, your well-wisher and friend,

<p/><div class="bookquote">``WILLIAM COLLINS''

 (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Bennet</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``At four o'clock, therefore, we may expect this peace-making gentleman,''
 (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Bennet</b></font>)</div>said Mr. Bennet, as he (<font color='blue'><b>Bennet</b></font>) folded up the letter. <div class="bookquote">``He (<font color='blue'><b>gentleman</b></font>) seems to be a most
conscientious and polite young man, upon my word, and I doubt not will
prove a valuable acquaintance, especially if Lady Catherine should be so
indulgent as to let him (<font color='blue'><b>acquaintance</b></font>) come to us again.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``There is some sense in what he (<font color='blue'><b>acquaintance</b></font>) says about the girls, however, and if
he (<font color='blue'><b>acquaintance</b></font>) is disposed to make them any amends, I shall not be the person to
discourage him (<font color='blue'><b>acquaintance</b></font>).''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Though it is difficult,''  (<font color='red'><b>Jane</b></font>)</div>said Jane, <div class="bookquote">``to guess in what way he (<font color='blue'><b>acquaintance</b></font>) can mean
to make us the atonement he (<font color='blue'><b>acquaintance</b></font>) thinks our due, the wish is certainly to his (<font color='blue'><b>acquaintance</b></font>)
credit.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Jane</b></font>)</div><p/>Elizabeth was chiefly struck by his (<font color='blue'><b>Bennet</b></font>) extraordinary deference for Lady
Catherine, and his (<font color='blue'><b>Bennet</b></font>) kind intention of christening, marrying, and burying
his (<font color='blue'><b>Bennet</b></font>) parishioners whenever it were required.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``He (<font color='blue'><b>acquaintance</b></font>) must be an oddity, I think,''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>said she (<font color='blue'><b>Catherine</b></font>). <div class="bookquote">``I cannot make him (<font color='blue'><b>acquaintance</b></font>)
out.--There is something very pompous in his (<font color='blue'><b>acquaintance</b></font>) style.--And what can he (<font color='blue'><b>acquaintance</b></font>)
mean by apologising for being next in the entail?--We cannot suppose he (<font color='blue'><b>acquaintance</b></font>)
would help it if he (<font color='blue'><b>acquaintance</b></font>) could.--Could he (<font color='blue'><b>acquaintance</b></font>) be a sensible man, sir?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``No, my dear, I think not. I have great hopes of finding him (<font color='blue'><b>acquaintance</b></font>) quite the
reverse. There is a mixture of servility and self-importance in his (<font color='blue'><b>acquaintance</b></font>)
letter, which promises well. I am impatient to see him (<font color='blue'><b>acquaintance</b></font>).''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``In point of composition,''  (<font color='red'><b>Mary/Mary King</b></font>)</div>said Mary, <div class="bookquote">``the letter does not seem
defective. The idea of the olive-branch perhaps is not wholly new, yet I
think it is well expressed.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Mary/Mary King</b></font>)</div><p/>To Catherine and Lydia, neither the letter nor its writer were in any
degree interesting. It was next to impossible that their cousin should
come in a scarlet coat, and it was now some weeks since they had
received pleasure from the society of a man in any other colour. As for
their mother, Mr. Collins's letter had done away much of her (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) ill-will,
and she (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) was preparing to see him (<font color='blue'><b>Collins</b></font>) with a degree of composure which
astonished her (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) husband and daughters.

<p/>Mr. Collins was punctual to his (<font color='blue'><b>Collins</b></font>) time, and was received with great
politeness by the whole family. Mr. Bennet indeed said little; but the
ladies were ready enough to talk, and Mr. Collins seemed neither in
need of encouragement, nor inclined to be silent himself. He (<font color='blue'><b>Collins</b></font>) was a
tall, heavy-looking young man of five-and-twenty. His (<font color='blue'><b>Collins</b></font>) air was grave and
stately, and his (<font color='blue'><b>Collins</b></font>) manners were very formal. He (<font color='blue'><b>Collins</b></font>) had not been long seated
before he (<font color='blue'><b>Collins</b></font>) complimented Mrs. Bennet on having so fine a family of
daughters; said he (<font color='blue'><b>Collins</b></font>) had heard much of their beauty, but that in this
instance fame had fallen short of the truth; and added, that he (<font color='blue'><b>Collins</b></font>) did
not doubt her (<font color='blue'><b>Bennet</b></font>) seeing them all in due time disposed of in marriage. This
gallantry was not much to the taste of some of his (<font color='blue'><b>Collins</b></font>) hearers; but Mrs.
Bennet, who quarreled with no compliments, answered most readily.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``You are very kind, I am sure; and I wish with all my heart it may
prove so, for else they will be destitute enough. Things are settled so
oddly.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``You allude, perhaps, to the entail of this estate.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Ah! sir, I do indeed. It is a grievous affair to my poor girls, you
must confess. Not that I mean to find fault with _you_, for such things
I know are all chance in this world. There is no knowing how estates
will go when once they come to be entailed.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I am very sensible, madam, of the hardship to my fair cousins, and
could say much on the subject, but that I am cautious of appearing
forward and precipitate. But I can assure the young ladies that I come
prepared to admire them. At present I will not say more; but, perhaps,
when we are better acquainted--''

 (<font color='red'><b>He</b></font>)</div><p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Collins</b></font>) was interrupted by a summons to dinner; and the girls smiled on each
other. They were not the only objects of Mr. Collins's admiration. The
hall, the dining-room, and all its furniture, were examined and praised;
and his (<font color='blue'><b>Collins</b></font>) commendation of everything would have touched Mrs. Bennet's
heart, but for the mortifying supposition of his (<font color='blue'><b>Collins</b></font>) viewing it all as his (<font color='blue'><b>Collins</b></font>)
own future property. The dinner too in its turn was highly admired; and
he (<font color='blue'><b>Collins</b></font>) begged to know to which of his (<font color='blue'><b>Collins</b></font>) fair cousins the excellency of its
cooking was owing. But he (<font color='blue'><b>Collins</b></font>) was set right there by Mrs. Bennet, who
assured him (<font color='blue'><b>Collins</b></font>) with some asperity that they were very well able to keep a
good cook, and that her (<font color='blue'><b>Bennet</b></font>) daughters had nothing to do in the kitchen. He (<font color='blue'><b>cook</b></font>)
begged pardon for having displeased her (<font color='blue'><b>Bennet</b></font>). In a softened tone she (<font color='blue'><b>Bennet</b></font>) declared
herself not at all offended; but he (<font color='blue'><b>cook</b></font>) continued to apologise for about a
quarter of an hour.



<p/>Chapter 14


<p/>During dinner, Mr. Bennet scarcely spoke at all; but when the servants
were withdrawn, he (<font color='blue'><b>Bennet</b></font>) thought it time to have some conversation with his (<font color='blue'><b>Bennet</b></font>)
guest, and therefore started a subject in which he (<font color='blue'><b>Bennet</b></font>) expected him (<font color='blue'><b>Bennet</b></font>) to
shine, by observing that he (<font color='blue'><b>Bennet</b></font>) seemed very fortunate in his (<font color='blue'><b>Bennet</b></font>) patroness. Lady
Catherine de Bourgh's attention to his (<font color='blue'><b>Bennet</b></font>) wishes, and consideration for
his (<font color='blue'><b>Bennet</b></font>) comfort, appeared very remarkable. Mr. Bennet could not have chosen
better. Mr. Collins was eloquent in her (<font color='blue'><b>Bourgh</b></font>) praise. The subject elevated him (<font color='blue'><b>Collins</b></font>)
to more than usual solemnity of manner, and with a most important aspect
he (<font color='blue'><b>Collins</b></font>) protested that <div class="bookquote">``he (<font color='blue'><b>I</b></font>) had never in his (<font color='blue'><b>I</b></font>) life witnessed such behaviour in
a person of rank--such affability and condescension, as he (<font color='blue'><b>I</b></font>) had himself
experienced from Lady Catherine. She (<font color='blue'><b>Catherine</b></font>) had been graciously pleased to
approve of both of the discourses which he (<font color='blue'><b>I</b></font>) had already had the honour of
preaching before her (<font color='blue'><b>Catherine</b></font>). She (<font color='blue'><b>Catherine</b></font>) had also asked him (<font color='blue'><b>I</b></font>) twice to dine at Rosings,
and had sent for him (<font color='blue'><b>I</b></font>) only the Saturday before, to make up her (<font color='blue'><b>Catherine</b></font>) pool of
quadrille in the evening. Lady Catherine was reckoned proud by many
people he (<font color='blue'><b>I</b></font>) knew, but _he (<font color='blue'><b>I</b></font>)_ had never seen anything but affability in her (<font color='blue'><b>Catherine</b></font>).
She (<font color='blue'><b>Catherine</b></font>) had always spoken to him (<font color='blue'><b>I</b></font>) as she (<font color='blue'><b>Catherine</b></font>) would to any other gentleman; she (<font color='blue'><b>Catherine</b></font>)
made not the smallest objection to his (<font color='blue'><b>gentleman</b></font>) joining in the society of the
neighbourhood nor to his (<font color='blue'><b>gentleman</b></font>) leaving the parish occasionally for a week or
two, to visit his (<font color='blue'><b>gentleman</b></font>) relations. She (<font color='blue'><b>Catherine</b></font>) had even condescended to advise him (<font color='blue'><b>gentleman</b></font>) to
marry as soon as he (<font color='blue'><b>gentleman</b></font>) could, provided he (<font color='blue'><b>gentleman</b></font>) chose with discretion; and had
once paid him (<font color='blue'><b>gentleman</b></font>) a visit in his (<font color='blue'><b>gentleman</b></font>) humble parsonage, where she (<font color='blue'><b>Catherine</b></font>) had perfectly
approved all the alterations he (<font color='blue'><b>gentleman</b></font>) had been making, and had even vouchsafed
to suggest some herself--some shelves in the closet up stairs.''

 (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``That is all very proper and civil, I am sure,''  (<font color='red'><b>Mrs. Bennet</b></font>)</div>said Mrs. Bennet, <div class="bookquote">``and
I dare say she (<font color='blue'><b>Catherine</b></font>) is a very agreeable woman. It is a pity that great ladies
in general are not more like her (<font color='blue'><b>Catherine</b></font>). Does she (<font color='blue'><b>Catherine</b></font>) live near you, sir?''

 (<font color='red'><b>Mrs. Bennet</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``The garden in which stands my humble abode is separated only by a lane
from Rosings Park, her (<font color='blue'><b>Catherine</b></font>) ladyship's residence.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I think you said she (<font color='blue'><b>Catherine</b></font>) was a widow, sir? Has she (<font color='blue'><b>Catherine</b></font>) any family?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``She (<font color='blue'><b>Catherine</b></font>) has only one daughter, the heiress of Rosings, and of very
extensive property.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Ah!''  (<font color='red'><b>Mrs. Bennet</b></font>)</div>said Mrs. Bennet, shaking her (<font color='blue'><b>Bennet</b></font>) head, <div class="bookquote">``then she (<font color='blue'><b>Catherine</b></font>) is better off than
many girls. And what sort of young lady is she (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>)? Is she (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) handsome?''

 (<font color='red'><b>Mrs. Bennet</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``She (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) is a most charming young lady indeed. Lady Catherine herself says
that, in point of true beauty, Miss de Bourgh is far superior to the
handsomest of her (<font color='blue'><b>Bourgh</b></font>) sex, because there is that in her (<font color='blue'><b>Bourgh</b></font>) features which marks
the young lady of distinguished birth. She (<font color='blue'><b>Bourgh</b></font>) is unfortunately of a sickly
constitution, which has prevented her (<font color='blue'><b>Bourgh</b></font>) from making that progress in many
accomplishments which she (<font color='blue'><b>Bourgh</b></font>) could not have otherwise failed of, as I am
informed by the lady who superintended her (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) education, and who still
resides with them. But she (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) is perfectly amiable, and often condescends
to drive by my humble abode in her (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) little phaeton and ponies.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Has she (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) been presented? I do not remember her (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) name among the ladies at
court.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Her (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) indifferent state of health unhappily prevents her (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) being in town;
and by that means, as I told Lady Catherine one day, has deprived the
British court of its brightest ornament. Her (<font color='blue'><b>Catherine</b></font>) ladyship seemed pleased
with the idea; and you may imagine that I am happy on every occasion to
offer those little delicate compliments which are always acceptable
to ladies. I have more than once observed to Lady Catherine, that
her (<font color='blue'><b>Catherine</b></font>) charming daughter seemed born to be a duchess, and that the most
elevated rank, instead of giving her (<font color='blue'><b>Catherine</b></font>) consequence, would be adorned by
her (<font color='blue'><b>Catherine</b></font>). These are the kind of little things which please her (<font color='blue'><b>Catherine</b></font>) ladyship, and
it is a sort of attention which I conceive myself peculiarly bound to
pay.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``You judge very properly,''  (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Bennet</b></font>)</div>said Mr. Bennet, <div class="bookquote">``and it is happy for you
that you possess the talent of flattering with delicacy. May I ask
whether these pleasing attentions proceed from the impulse of the
moment, or are the result of previous study?''

 (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Bennet</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``They arise chiefly from what is passing at the time, and though I
sometimes amuse myself with suggesting and arranging such little elegant
compliments as may be adapted to ordinary occasions, I always wish to
give them as unstudied an air as possible.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Bennet</b></font>)</div><p/>Mr. Bennet's expectations were fully answered. His (<font color='blue'><b>Bennet</b></font>) cousin was as absurd
as he (<font color='blue'><b>Bennet</b></font>) had hoped, and he (<font color='blue'><b>Bennet</b></font>) listened to him (<font color='blue'><b>Bennet</b></font>) with the keenest enjoyment,
maintaining at the same time the most resolute composure of countenance,
and, except in an occasional glance at Elizabeth, requiring no partner
in his (<font color='blue'><b>Bennet</b></font>) pleasure.

<p/>By tea-time, however, the dose had been enough, and Mr. Bennet was glad
to take his (<font color='blue'><b>Bennet</b></font>) guest into the drawing-room again, and, when tea was over,
glad to invite him (<font color='blue'><b>Bennet</b></font>) to read aloud to the ladies. Mr. Collins readily
assented, and a book was produced; but, on beholding it -LRB-for everything
announced it to be from a circulating library-RRB-, he (<font color='blue'><b>Collins</b></font>) started back, and
begging pardon, protested that he (<font color='blue'><b>Collins</b></font>) never read novels. Kitty stared at
him (<font color='blue'><b>Collins</b></font>), and Lydia exclaimed. Other books were produced, and after some
deliberation he (<font color='blue'><b>Collins</b></font>) chose Fordyce's Sermons. Lydia gaped as he (<font color='blue'><b>Collins</b></font>) opened the
volume, and before he (<font color='blue'><b>Collins</b></font>) had, with very monotonous solemnity, read three
pages, she (<font color='blue'><b>Lydia</b></font>) interrupted him (<font color='blue'><b>Collins</b></font>) with:

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Do you know, mamma, that my uncle Phillips talks of turning away
Richard; and if he (<font color='blue'><b>Richard</b></font>) does, Colonel Forster will hire him (<font color='blue'><b>Richard</b></font>). My aunt told me
so herself on Saturday. I shall walk to Meryton to-morrow to hear more
about it, and to ask when Mr. Denny comes back from town.''

 (<font color='red'><b>him</b></font>)</div><p/>Lydia was bid by her (<font color='blue'><b>Lydia</b></font>) two eldest sisters to hold her (<font color='blue'><b>Lydia</b></font>) tongue; but Mr.
Collins, much offended, laid aside his (<font color='blue'><b>Collins</b></font>) book, and said:

<p/><div class="bookquote">``I have often observed how little young ladies are interested by books
of a serious stamp, though written solely for their benefit. It amazes
me, I confess; for, certainly, there can be nothing so advantageous to
them as instruction. But I will no longer importune my young cousin.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Collins</b></font>)</div><p/>Then turning to Mr. Bennet, he (<font color='blue'><b>Bennet</b></font>) offered himself as his (<font color='blue'><b>Bennet</b></font>) antagonist at
backgammon. Mr. Bennet accepted the challenge, observing that he (<font color='blue'><b>Bennet</b></font>) acted
very wisely in leaving the girls to their own trifling amusements.
Mrs. Bennet and her (<font color='blue'><b>Bennet</b></font>) daughters apologised most civilly for Lydia's
interruption, and promised that it should not occur again, if he (<font color='blue'><b>Bennet</b></font>) would
resume his (<font color='blue'><b>Bennet</b></font>) book; but Mr. Collins, after assuring them that he (<font color='blue'><b>Collins</b></font>) bore his (<font color='blue'><b>Collins</b></font>)
young cousin no ill-will, and should never resent her (<font color='blue'><b>Bennet</b></font>) behaviour as any
affront, seated himself at another table with Mr. Bennet, and prepared
for backgammon.



<p/>Chapter 15


<p/>Mr. Collins was not a sensible man, and the deficiency of nature had
been but little assisted by education or society; the greatest part
of his (<font color='blue'><b>Collins</b></font>) life having been spent under the guidance of an illiterate and
miserly father; and though he (<font color='blue'><b>Collins</b></font>) belonged to one of the universities, he (<font color='blue'><b>Collins</b></font>)
had merely kept the necessary terms, without forming at it any useful
acquaintance. The subjection in which his (<font color='blue'><b>Collins</b></font>) father had brought him (<font color='blue'><b>Collins</b></font>) up had
given him (<font color='blue'><b>Collins</b></font>) originally great humility of manner; but it was now a
good deal counteracted by the self-conceit of a weak head, living in
retirement, and the consequential feelings of early and unexpected
prosperity. A fortunate chance had recommended him (<font color='blue'><b>Collins</b></font>) to Lady Catherine de
Bourgh when the living of Hunsford was vacant; and the respect which
he (<font color='blue'><b>Collins</b></font>) felt for her (<font color='blue'><b>Bourgh</b></font>) high rank, and his (<font color='blue'><b>Collins</b></font>) veneration for her (<font color='blue'><b>Bourgh</b></font>) as his (<font color='blue'><b>Collins</b></font>) patroness,
mingling with a very good opinion of himself, of his (<font color='blue'><b>Collins</b></font>) authority as a
clergyman, and his (<font color='blue'><b>Collins</b></font>) right as a rector, made him (<font color='blue'><b>Collins</b></font>) altogether a mixture of
pride and obsequiousness, self-importance and humility.

<p/>Having now a good house and a very sufficient income, he (<font color='blue'><b>Collins</b></font>) intended to
marry; and in seeking a reconciliation with the Longbourn family he (<font color='blue'><b>Collins</b></font>) had
a wife in view, as he (<font color='blue'><b>Collins</b></font>) meant to choose one of the daughters, if he (<font color='blue'><b>Collins</b></font>) found
them as handsome and amiable as they were represented by common report.
This was his (<font color='blue'><b>Collins</b></font>) plan of amends--of atonement--for inheriting their father's
estate; and he (<font color='blue'><b>Collins</b></font>) thought it an excellent one, full of eligibility and
suitableness, and excessively generous and disinterested on his (<font color='blue'><b>Collins</b></font>) own
part.

<p/>His (<font color='blue'><b>Collins</b></font>) plan did not vary on seeing them. Miss Bennet's lovely face
confirmed his (<font color='blue'><b>Collins</b></font>) views, and established all his (<font color='blue'><b>Collins</b></font>) strictest notions of what
was due to seniority; and for the first evening _she (<font color='blue'><b>Bennet</b></font>)_ was his (<font color='blue'><b>Collins</b></font>) settled
choice. The next morning, however, made an alteration; for in a
quarter of an hour's tete-a-tete with Mrs. Bennet before breakfast, a
conversation beginning with his (<font color='blue'><b>Collins</b></font>) parsonage-house, and leading naturally
to the avowal of his (<font color='blue'><b>Collins</b></font>) hopes, that a mistress might be found for it at
Longbourn, produced from her (<font color='blue'><b>mistress</b></font>), amid very complaisant smiles and general
encouragement, a caution against the very Jane he (<font color='blue'><b>Collins</b></font>) had fixed on. <div class="bookquote">``As to
her (<font color='blue'><b>Forster</b></font>) _younger_ daughters, she (<font color='blue'><b>Forster</b></font>) could not take upon her (<font color='blue'><b>Forster</b></font>) to say--she (<font color='blue'><b>Forster</b></font>) could
not positively answer--but she (<font color='blue'><b>Forster</b></font>) did not _know_ of any prepossession; her (<font color='blue'><b>Forster</b></font>)
_eldest_ daughter, she (<font color='blue'><b>Forster</b></font>) must just mention--she (<font color='blue'><b>Forster</b></font>) felt it incumbent on her (<font color='blue'><b>Forster</b></font>)
to hint, was likely to be very soon engaged.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Collins</b></font>)</div><p/>Mr. Collins had only to change from Jane to Elizabeth--and it was soon
done--done while Mrs. Bennet was stirring the fire. Elizabeth, equally
next to Jane in birth and beauty, succeeded her (<font color='blue'><b>Jane</b></font>) of course.

<p/>Mrs. Bennet treasured up the hint, and trusted that she (<font color='blue'><b>Bennet</b></font>) might soon have
two daughters married; and the man whom she (<font color='blue'><b>Bennet</b></font>) could not bear to speak of
the day before was now high in her (<font color='blue'><b>Bennet</b></font>) good graces.

<p/>Lydia's intention of walking to Meryton was not forgotten; every sister
except Mary agreed to go with her (<font color='blue'><b>Mary</b></font>); and Mr. Collins was to attend them,
at the request of Mr. Bennet, who was most anxious to get rid of him (<font color='blue'><b>Bennet</b></font>),
and have his (<font color='blue'><b>Bennet</b></font>) library to himself; for thither Mr. Collins had followed
him (<font color='blue'><b>Collins</b></font>) after breakfast; and there he (<font color='blue'><b>Collins</b></font>) would continue, nominally engaged with
one of the largest folios in the collection, but really talking to Mr.
Bennet, with little cessation, of his (<font color='blue'><b>Bennet</b></font>) house and garden at Hunsford. Such
doings discomposed Mr. Bennet exceedingly. In his (<font color='blue'><b>Bennet</b></font>) library he (<font color='blue'><b>Bennet</b></font>) had been
always sure of leisure and tranquillity; and though prepared, as he (<font color='blue'><b>Bennet</b></font>) told
Elizabeth, to meet with folly and conceit in every other room of the
house, he (<font color='blue'><b>Bennet</b></font>) was used to be free from them there; his (<font color='blue'><b>Bennet</b></font>) civility, therefore,
was most prompt in inviting Mr. Collins to join his (<font color='blue'><b>Collins</b></font>) daughters in their
walk; and Mr. Collins, being in fact much better fitted for a walker
than a reader, was extremely pleased to close his (<font color='blue'><b>Collins</b></font>) large book, and go.

<p/>In pompous nothings on his (<font color='blue'><b>Collins</b></font>) side, and civil assents on that of his (<font color='blue'><b>Collins</b></font>)
cousins, their time passed till they entered Meryton. The attention of
the younger ones was then no longer to be gained by him (<font color='blue'><b>Collins</b></font>). Their eyes were
immediately wandering up in the street in quest of the officers, and
nothing less than a very smart bonnet indeed, or a really new muslin in
a shop window, could recall them.

<p/>But the attention of every lady was soon caught by a young man, whom
they had never seen before, of most gentlemanlike appearance, walking
with another officer on the other side of the way. The officer was
the very Mr. Denny concerning whose return from London Lydia came
to inquire, and he (<font color='blue'><b>Denny</b></font>) bowed as they passed. All were struck with the
stranger's air, all wondered who he (<font color='blue'><b>Denny</b></font>) could be; and Kitty and Lydia,
determined if possible to find out, led the way across the street, under
pretense of wanting something in an opposite shop, and fortunately
had just gained the pavement when the two gentlemen, turning back, had
reached the same spot. Mr. Denny addressed them directly, and entreated
permission to introduce his (<font color='blue'><b>Denny</b></font>) friend, Mr. Wickham, who had returned with
him (<font color='blue'><b>Denny</b></font>) the day before from town, and he (<font color='blue'><b>Denny</b></font>) was happy to say had accepted a
commission in their corps. This was exactly as it should be; for the
young man wanted only regimentals to make him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) completely charming.
His (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) appearance was greatly in his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) favour; he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) had all the best part of
beauty, a fine countenance, a good figure, and very pleasing address.
The introduction was followed up on his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) side by a happy readiness
of conversation--a readiness at the same time perfectly correct and
unassuming; and the whole party were still standing and talking together
very agreeably, when the sound of horses drew their notice, and Darcy
and Bingley were seen riding down the street. On distinguishing the
ladies of the group, the two gentlemen came directly towards them, and
began the usual civilities. Bingley was the principal spokesman, and
Miss Bennet the principal object. He (<font color='blue'><b>Bingley</b></font>) was then, he (<font color='blue'><b>Bingley</b></font>) said, on his (<font color='blue'><b>Bingley</b></font>) way to
Longbourn on purpose to inquire after her (<font color='blue'><b>Bennet</b></font>). Mr. Darcy corroborated
it with a bow, and was beginning to determine not to fix his (<font color='blue'><b>Darcy</b></font>) eyes
on Elizabeth, when they were suddenly arrested by the sight of the
stranger, and Elizabeth happening to see the countenance of both as they
looked at each other, was all astonishment at the effect of the meeting.
Both changed colour, one looked white, the other red. Mr. Wickham,
after a few moments, touched his (<font color='blue'><b>Wickham</b></font>) hat--a salutation which Mr. Darcy just
deigned to return. What could be the meaning of it? It was impossible to
imagine; it was impossible not to long to know.

<p/>In another minute, Mr. Bingley, but without seeming to have noticed what
passed, took leave and rode on with his (<font color='blue'><b>Bingley</b></font>) friend.

<p/>Mr. Denny and Mr. Wickham walked with the young ladies to the door of
Mr. Phillip's house, and then made their bows, in spite of Miss Lydia's
pressing entreaties that they should come in, and even in spite of
Mrs. Phillips's throwing up the parlour window and loudly seconding the
invitation.

<p/>Mrs. Phillips was always glad to see her (<font color='blue'><b>Phillips</b></font>) nieces; and the two eldest,
from their recent absence, were particularly welcome, and she (<font color='blue'><b>Phillips</b></font>) was
eagerly expressing her (<font color='blue'><b>Phillips</b></font>) surprise at their sudden return home, which, as
their own carriage had not fetched them, she (<font color='blue'><b>Phillips</b></font>) should have known nothing
about, if she (<font color='blue'><b>Phillips</b></font>) had not happened to see Mr. Jones's shop-boy in the
street, who had told her (<font color='blue'><b>Phillips</b></font>) that they were not to send any more draughts to
Netherfield because the Miss Bennets were come away, when her (<font color='blue'><b>Bennets</b></font>) civility
was claimed towards Mr. Collins by Jane's introduction of him (<font color='blue'><b>Collins</b></font>). She (<font color='blue'><b>Bennets</b></font>)
received him (<font color='blue'><b>Collins</b></font>) with her (<font color='blue'><b>Bennets</b></font>) very best politeness, which he (<font color='blue'><b>Collins</b></font>) returned with
as much more, apologising for his (<font color='blue'><b>Collins</b></font>) intrusion, without any previous
acquaintance with her (<font color='blue'><b>Bennets</b></font>), which he (<font color='blue'><b>Collins</b></font>) could not help flattering himself,
however, might be justified by his (<font color='blue'><b>Collins</b></font>) relationship to the young ladies who
introduced him (<font color='blue'><b>Collins</b></font>) to her (<font color='blue'><b>Bennets</b></font>) notice. Mrs. Phillips was quite awed by such an
excess of good breeding; but her (<font color='blue'><b>Phillips</b></font>) contemplation of one stranger was soon
put to an end by exclamations and inquiries about the other; of whom,
however, she (<font color='blue'><b>Phillips</b></font>) could only tell her (<font color='blue'><b>Phillips</b></font>) nieces what they already knew, that
Mr. Denny had brought him (<font color='blue'><b>Denny</b></font>) from London, and that he (<font color='blue'><b>Denny</b></font>) was to have a
lieutenant's commission in the --shire. She (<font color='blue'><b>Phillips</b></font>) had been watching him (<font color='blue'><b>Denny</b></font>) the
last hour, she (<font color='blue'><b>Phillips</b></font>) said, as he (<font color='blue'><b>Denny</b></font>) walked up and down the street, and had Mr.
Wickham appeared, Kitty and Lydia would certainly have continued the
occupation, but unluckily no one passed windows now except a few of the
officers, who, in comparison with the stranger, were become <div class="bookquote">``stupid,
disagreeable fellows.''  (<font color='red'><b>the stranger</b></font>)</div>Some of them were to dine with the Phillipses
the next day, and their aunt promised to make her (<font color='blue'><b>aunt</b></font>) husband call on Mr.
Wickham, and give him (<font color='blue'><b>Wickham</b></font>) an invitation also, if the family from Longbourn
would come in the evening. This was agreed to, and Mrs. Phillips
protested that they would have a nice comfortable noisy game of lottery
tickets, and a little bit of hot supper afterwards. The prospect of such
delights was very cheering, and they parted in mutual good spirits. Mr.
Collins repeated his (<font color='blue'><b>Collins</b></font>) apologies in quitting the room, and was assured
with unwearying civility that they were perfectly needless.

<p/>As they walked home, Elizabeth related to Jane what she (<font color='blue'><b>Jane</b></font>) had seen pass
between the two gentlemen; but though Jane would have defended either
or both, had they appeared to be in the wrong, she (<font color='blue'><b>Jane</b></font>) could no more explain
such behaviour than her (<font color='blue'><b>Jane</b></font>) sister.

<p/>Mr. Collins on his (<font color='blue'><b>Collins</b></font>) return highly gratified Mrs. Bennet by admiring
Mrs. Phillips's manners and politeness. He (<font color='blue'><b>Collins</b></font>) protested that, except Lady
Catherine and her (<font color='blue'><b>Catherine</b></font>) daughter, he (<font color='blue'><b>Collins</b></font>) had never seen a more elegant woman;
for she (<font color='blue'><b>Catherine</b></font>) had not only received him (<font color='blue'><b>Collins</b></font>) with the utmost civility, but even
pointedly included him (<font color='blue'><b>Collins</b></font>) in her (<font color='blue'><b>Catherine</b></font>) invitation for the next evening, although
utterly unknown to her (<font color='blue'><b>Catherine</b></font>) before. Something, he (<font color='blue'><b>Collins</b></font>) supposed, might be
attributed to his (<font color='blue'><b>Collins</b></font>) connection with them, but yet he (<font color='blue'><b>Collins</b></font>) had never met with so
much attention in the whole course of his (<font color='blue'><b>Collins</b></font>) life.



<p/>Chapter 16


<p/>As no objection was made to the young people's engagement with their
aunt, and all Mr. Collins's scruples of leaving Mr. and Mrs. Bennet for
a single evening during his (<font color='blue'><b>Collins</b></font>) visit were most steadily resisted, the coach
conveyed him (<font color='blue'><b>coach</b></font>) and his (<font color='blue'><b>coach</b></font>) five cousins at a suitable hour to Meryton; and
the girls had the pleasure of hearing, as they entered the drawing-room,
that Mr. Wickham had accepted their uncle's invitation, and was then in
the house.

<p/>When this information was given, and they had all taken their seats, Mr.
Collins was at leisure to look around him (<font color='blue'><b>Collins</b></font>) and admire, and he (<font color='blue'><b>Collins</b></font>) was so much
struck with the size and furniture of the apartment, that he (<font color='blue'><b>Collins</b></font>) declared he (<font color='blue'><b>Collins</b></font>)
might almost have supposed himself in the small summer breakfast
parlour at Rosings; a comparison that did not at first convey much
gratification; but when Mrs. Phillips understood from him (<font color='blue'><b>Collins</b></font>) what
Rosings was, and who was its proprietor--when she (<font color='blue'><b>Phillips</b></font>) had listened to the
description of only one of Lady Catherine's drawing-rooms, and found
that the chimney-piece alone had cost eight hundred pounds, she (<font color='blue'><b>Catherine</b></font>) felt all
the force of the compliment, and would hardly have resented a comparison
with the housekeeper's room.

<p/>In describing to her (<font color='blue'><b>housekeeper</b></font>) all the grandeur of Lady Catherine and her (<font color='blue'><b>Catherine</b></font>) mansion,
with occasional digressions in praise of his (<font color='blue'><b>proprietor</b></font>) own humble abode, and
the improvements it was receiving, he (<font color='blue'><b>proprietor</b></font>) was happily employed until the
gentlemen joined them; and he (<font color='blue'><b>proprietor</b></font>) found in Mrs. Phillips a very attentive
listener, whose opinion of his (<font color='blue'><b>proprietor</b></font>) consequence increased with what she (<font color='blue'><b>Phillips</b></font>)
heard, and who was resolving to retail it all among her (<font color='blue'><b>Phillips</b></font>) neighbours as
soon as she (<font color='blue'><b>Phillips</b></font>) could. To the girls, who could not listen to their cousin,
and who had nothing to do but to wish for an instrument, and examine
their own indifferent imitations of china on the mantelpiece, the
interval of waiting appeared very long. It was over at last, however.
The gentlemen did approach, and when Mr. Wickham walked into the room,
Elizabeth felt that she (<font color='blue'><b>Elizabeth</b></font>) had neither been seeing him (<font color='blue'><b>Wickham</b></font>) before, nor thinking
of him (<font color='blue'><b>Wickham</b></font>) since, with the smallest degree of unreasonable admiration.
The officers of the --shire were in general a very creditable,
gentlemanlike set, and the best of them were of the present party; but
Mr. Wickham was as far beyond them all in person, countenance, air, and
walk, as _they_ were superior to the broad-faced, stuffy uncle Phillips,
breathing port wine, who followed them into the room.

<p/>Mr. Wickham was the happy man towards whom almost every female eye was
turned, and Elizabeth was the happy woman by whom he (<font color='blue'><b>Wickham</b></font>) finally seated
himself; and the agreeable manner in which he (<font color='blue'><b>Wickham</b></font>) immediately fell into
conversation, though it was only on its being a wet night, made her (<font color='blue'><b>Elizabeth</b></font>) feel
that the commonest, dullest, most threadbare topic might be rendered
interesting by the skill of the speaker.

<p/>With such rivals for the notice of the fair as Mr. Wickham and the
officers, Mr. Collins seemed to sink into insignificance; to the young
ladies he (<font color='blue'><b>Wickham</b></font>) certainly was nothing; but he (<font color='blue'><b>Wickham</b></font>) had still at intervals a kind
listener in Mrs. Phillips, and was by her (<font color='blue'><b>Phillips</b></font>) watchfulness, most abundantly
supplied with coffee and muffin. When the card-tables were placed, he (<font color='blue'><b>Wickham</b></font>)
had the opportunity of obliging her (<font color='blue'><b>Phillips</b></font>) in turn, by sitting down to whist.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``I know little of the game at present,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>said he (<font color='blue'><b>Wickham</b></font>), <div class="bookquote">``but I shall be glad
to improve myself, for in my situation in life--''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>Mrs. Phillips was very
glad for his (<font color='blue'><b>Wickham</b></font>) compliance, but could not wait for his (<font color='blue'><b>Wickham</b></font>) reason.

<p/>Mr. Wickham did not play at whist, and with ready delight was he (<font color='blue'><b>Wickham</b></font>)
received at the other table between Elizabeth and Lydia. At first there
seemed danger of Lydia's engrossing him (<font color='blue'><b>Wickham</b></font>) entirely, for she (<font color='blue'><b>Lydia</b></font>) was a most
determined talker; but being likewise extremely fond of lottery tickets,
she (<font color='blue'><b>Lydia</b></font>) soon grew too much interested in the game, too eager in making bets
and exclaiming after prizes to have attention for anyone in particular.
Allowing for the common demands of the game, Mr. Wickham was therefore
at leisure to talk to Elizabeth, and she (<font color='blue'><b>Elizabeth</b></font>) was very willing to hear
him (<font color='blue'><b>Wickham</b></font>), though what she (<font color='blue'><b>Elizabeth</b></font>) chiefly wished to hear she (<font color='blue'><b>Elizabeth</b></font>) could not hope to be
told--the history of his (<font color='blue'><b>Wickham</b></font>) acquaintance with Mr. Darcy. She (<font color='blue'><b>Elizabeth</b></font>) dared not
even mention that gentleman. Her (<font color='blue'><b>Elizabeth</b></font>) curiosity, however, was unexpectedly
relieved. Mr. Wickham began the subject himself. He (<font color='blue'><b>Wickham</b></font>) inquired how far
Netherfield was from Meryton; and, after receiving her (<font color='blue'><b>Elizabeth</b></font>) answer, asked in
a hesitating manner how long Mr. Darcy had been staying there.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``About a month,''  (<font color='red'><b>Elizabeth/Miss Bennet/Miss Elizabeth</b></font>)</div>said Elizabeth; and then, unwilling to let the subject
drop, added, <div class="bookquote">``He (<font color='blue'><b>fellows</b></font>) is a man of very large property in Derbyshire, I
understand.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Elizabeth/Miss Bennet/Miss Elizabeth</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Yes,''  (<font color='red'><b>Wickham/Mr. Wickham</b></font>)</div>replied Mr. Wickham; <div class="bookquote">``his (<font color='blue'><b>fellows</b></font>) estate there is a noble one. A clear
ten thousand per annum. You could not have met with a person more
capable of giving you certain information on that head than myself, for
I have been connected with his (<font color='blue'><b>fellows</b></font>) family in a particular manner from my
infancy.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Wickham/Mr. Wickham</b></font>)</div><p/>Elizabeth could not but look surprised.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``You may well be surprised, Miss Bennet, at such an assertion, after
seeing, as you probably might, the very cold manner of our meeting
yesterday. Are you much acquainted with Mr. Darcy?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``As much as I ever wish to be,''  (<font color='red'><b>Elizabeth/Miss Bennet/Miss Elizabeth</b></font>)</div>cried Elizabeth very warmly. <div class="bookquote">``I have
spent four days in the same house with him (<font color='blue'><b>Darcy</b></font>), and I think him (<font color='blue'><b>Darcy</b></font>) very
disagreeable.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I have no right to give _my_ opinion,''  (<font color='red'><b>Wickham/Mr. Wickham</b></font>)</div>said Wickham, <div class="bookquote">``as to his (<font color='blue'><b>Darcy</b></font>) being
agreeable or otherwise. I am not qualified to form one. I have known him (<font color='blue'><b>Darcy</b></font>)
too long and too well to be a fair judge. It is impossible for _me_
to be impartial. But I believe your opinion of him (<font color='blue'><b>judge</b></font>) would in general
astonish--and perhaps you would not express it quite so strongly
anywhere else. Here you are in your own family.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Wickham/Mr. Wickham</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Upon my word, I say no more _here_ than I might say in any house in
the neighbourhood, except Netherfield. He (<font color='blue'><b>judge</b></font>) is not at all liked in
Hertfordshire. Everybody is disgusted with his (<font color='blue'><b>judge</b></font>) pride. You will not find
him (<font color='blue'><b>judge</b></font>) more favourably spoken of by anyone.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I cannot pretend to be sorry,''  (<font color='red'><b>Wickham/Mr. Wickham</b></font>)</div>said Wickham, after a short
interruption, <div class="bookquote">``that he (<font color='blue'><b>judge</b></font>) or that any man should not be estimated beyond
their deserts; but with _him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>)_ I believe it does not often happen. The
world is blinded by his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) fortune and consequence, or frightened by his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>)
high and imposing manners, and sees him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) only as he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) chooses to be seen.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Wickham/Mr. Wickham</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I should take him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>), even on _my_ slight acquaintance, to be an
ill-tempered man.''  (<font color='red'><b>Wickham/Mr. Wickham</b></font>)</div>Wickham only shook his (<font color='blue'><b>Wickham</b></font>) head.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``I wonder,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>said he (<font color='blue'><b>Wickham</b></font>), at the next opportunity of speaking, <div class="bookquote">``whether he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) is
likely to be in this country much longer.''

 (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I do not at all know; but I _heard_ nothing of his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) going away when I
was at Netherfield. I hope your plans in favour of the --shire will
not be affected by his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) being in the neighbourhood.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Oh! no--it is not for _me_ to be driven away by Mr. Darcy. If _he (<font color='blue'><b>Darcy</b></font>)_
wishes to avoid seeing _me_, he (<font color='blue'><b>Darcy</b></font>) must go. We are not on friendly terms,
and it always gives me pain to meet him (<font color='blue'><b>Darcy</b></font>), but I have no reason for
avoiding _him (<font color='blue'><b>Darcy</b></font>)_ but what I might proclaim before all the world, a sense
of very great ill-usage, and most painful regrets at his (<font color='blue'><b>Darcy</b></font>) being what he (<font color='blue'><b>Darcy</b></font>)
is. His (<font color='blue'><b>Darcy</b></font>) father, Miss Bennet, the late Mr. Darcy, was one of the best men
that ever breathed, and the truest friend I ever had; and I can never
be in company with this Mr. Darcy without being grieved to the soul by
a thousand tender recollections. His (<font color='blue'><b>Darcy</b></font>) behaviour to myself has been
scandalous; but I verily believe I could forgive him (<font color='blue'><b>Darcy</b></font>) anything and
everything, rather than his (<font color='blue'><b>Darcy</b></font>) disappointing the hopes and disgracing the
memory of his (<font color='blue'><b>Darcy</b></font>) father.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Elizabeth/Miss Bennet/Miss Elizabeth</b></font>)</div><p/>Elizabeth found the interest of the subject increase, and listened with
all her (<font color='blue'><b>Elizabeth</b></font>) heart; but the delicacy of it prevented further inquiry.

<p/>Mr. Wickham began to speak on more general topics, Meryton, the
neighbourhood, the society, appearing highly pleased with all that
he (<font color='blue'><b>Wickham</b></font>) had yet seen, and speaking of the latter with gentle but very
intelligible gallantry.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``It was the prospect of constant society, and good society,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Wickham</b></font>) added,
<div class="bookquote">``which was my chief inducement to enter the --shire. I knew it to be
a most respectable, agreeable corps, and my friend Denny tempted me
further by his (<font color='blue'><b>Denny</b></font>) account of their present quarters, and the very great
attentions and excellent acquaintances Meryton had procured them.
Society, I own, is necessary to me. I have been a disappointed man, and
my spirits will not bear solitude. I _must_ have employment and society.
A military life is not what I was intended for, but circumstances have
now made it eligible. The church _ought_ to have been my profession--I
was brought up for the church, and I should at this time have been in
possession of a most valuable living, had it pleased the gentleman we
were speaking of just now.''

 (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Indeed!''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Yes--the late Mr. Darcy bequeathed me the next presentation of the best
living in his (<font color='blue'><b>Darcy</b></font>) gift. He (<font color='blue'><b>Darcy</b></font>) was my godfather, and excessively attached to me.
I cannot do justice to his (<font color='blue'><b>Darcy</b></font>) kindness. He (<font color='blue'><b>Darcy</b></font>) meant to provide for me amply,
and thought he (<font color='blue'><b>Darcy</b></font>) had done it; but when the living fell, it was given
elsewhere.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Good heavens!''  (<font color='red'><b>Elizabeth/Miss Bennet/Miss Elizabeth</b></font>)</div>cried Elizabeth; <div class="bookquote">``but how could _that_ be? How could his (<font color='blue'><b>Darcy</b></font>)
will be disregarded? Why did you not seek legal redress?''

 (<font color='red'><b>Elizabeth/Miss Bennet/Miss Elizabeth</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``There was just such an informality in the terms of the bequest as to
give me no hope from law. A man of honour could not have doubted the
intention, but Mr. Darcy chose to doubt it--or to treat it as a merely
conditional recommendation, and to assert that I had forfeited all claim
to it by extravagance, imprudence--in short anything or nothing. Certain
it is, that the living became vacant two years ago, exactly as I was
of an age to hold it, and that it was given to another man; and no
less certain is it, that I cannot accuse myself of having really done
anything to deserve to lose it. I have a warm, unguarded temper, and
I may have spoken my opinion _of_ him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>), and _to_ him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>), too freely. I can
recall nothing worse. But the fact is, that we are very different sort
of men, and that he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) hates me.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``This is quite shocking! He (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) deserves to be publicly disgraced.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Some time or other he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) _will_ be--but it shall not be by _me_. Till I
can forget his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) father, I can never defy or expose _him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>)_.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Elizabeth/Miss Bennet/Miss Elizabeth</b></font>)</div><p/>Elizabeth honoured him (<font color='blue'><b>Wickham</b></font>) for such feelings, and thought him (<font color='blue'><b>Wickham</b></font>) handsomer than
ever as he (<font color='blue'><b>Wickham</b></font>) expressed them.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``But what,''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>said she (<font color='blue'><b>Elizabeth</b></font>), after a pause, <div class="bookquote">``can have been his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) motive? What can
have induced him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) to behave so cruelly?''

 (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``A thorough, determined dislike of me--a dislike which I cannot but
attribute in some measure to jealousy. Had the late Mr. Darcy liked me
less, his (<font color='blue'><b>Darcy</b></font>) son might have borne with me better; but his (<font color='blue'><b>Darcy</b></font>) father's uncommon
attachment to me irritated him (<font color='blue'><b>Darcy</b></font>), I believe, very early in life. He (<font color='blue'><b>Darcy</b></font>) had
not a temper to bear the sort of competition in which we stood--the sort
of preference which was often given me.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I had not thought Mr. Darcy so bad as this--though I have never liked
him (<font color='blue'><b>Darcy</b></font>). I had not thought so very ill of him (<font color='blue'><b>Darcy</b></font>). I had supposed him (<font color='blue'><b>Darcy</b></font>) to be
despising his (<font color='blue'><b>Darcy</b></font>) fellow-creatures in general, but did not suspect him (<font color='blue'><b>Darcy</b></font>) of
descending to such malicious revenge, such injustice, such inhumanity as
this.''

 (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div><p/>After a few minutes' reflection, however, she (<font color='blue'><b>Elizabeth</b></font>) continued, <div class="bookquote">``I _do_
remember his (<font color='blue'><b>Darcy</b></font>) boasting one day, at Netherfield, of the implacability of
his (<font color='blue'><b>Darcy</b></font>) resentments, of his (<font color='blue'><b>Darcy</b></font>) having an unforgiving temper. His (<font color='blue'><b>Darcy</b></font>) disposition
must be dreadful.''

 (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I will not trust myself on the subject,''  (<font color='red'><b>Wickham/Mr. Wickham</b></font>)</div>replied Wickham; <div class="bookquote">``I can hardly
be just to him (<font color='blue'><b>Darcy</b></font>).''

 (<font color='red'><b>Wickham/Mr. Wickham</b></font>)</div><p/>Elizabeth was again deep in thought, and after a time exclaimed, <div class="bookquote">``To
treat in such a manner the godson, the friend, the favourite of his (<font color='blue'><b>friend</b></font>)
father!''  (<font color='red'><b>Elizabeth/Miss Bennet/Miss Elizabeth</b></font>)</div>She (<font color='blue'><b>Elizabeth</b></font>) could have added, <div class="bookquote">``A young man, too, like _you_, whose very
countenance may vouch for your being amiable'' (<font color='red'><b>She</b></font>)</div>--but she (<font color='blue'><b>Elizabeth</b></font>) contented herself
with, <div class="bookquote">``and one, too, who had probably been his (<font color='blue'><b>friend</b></font>) companion from childhood,
connected together, as I think you said, in the closest manner!''

 (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``We were born in the same parish, within the same park; the greatest
part of our youth was passed together; inmates of the same house,
sharing the same amusements, objects of the same parental care. _My_
father began life in the profession which your uncle, Mr. Phillips,
appears to do so much credit to--but he (<font color='blue'><b>Phillips</b></font>) gave up everything to be of
use to the late Mr. Darcy and devoted all his (<font color='blue'><b>Darcy</b></font>) time to the care of the
Pemberley property. He (<font color='blue'><b>Darcy</b></font>) was most highly esteemed by Mr. Darcy, a most
intimate, confidential friend. Mr. Darcy often acknowledged himself to
be under the greatest obligations to my father's active superintendence,
and when, immediately before my father's death, Mr. Darcy gave him (<font color='blue'><b>Darcy</b></font>) a
voluntary promise of providing for me, I am convinced that he (<font color='blue'><b>Darcy</b></font>) felt it to
be as much a debt of gratitude to _him (<font color='blue'><b>Darcy</b></font>)_, as of his (<font color='blue'><b>Darcy</b></font>) affection to myself.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``How strange!''  (<font color='red'><b>Elizabeth/Miss Bennet/Miss Elizabeth</b></font>)</div>cried Elizabeth. <div class="bookquote">``How abominable! I wonder that the very
pride of this Mr. Darcy has not made him (<font color='blue'><b>Darcy</b></font>) just to you! If from no better
motive, that he (<font color='blue'><b>Darcy</b></font>) should not have been too proud to be dishonest--for
dishonesty I must call it.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``It _is_ wonderful,''  (<font color='red'><b>Wickham/Mr. Wickham</b></font>)</div>replied Wickham, <div class="bookquote">``for almost all his (<font color='blue'><b>Darcy</b></font>) actions may
be traced to pride; and pride had often been his (<font color='blue'><b>Darcy</b></font>) best friend. It has
connected him (<font color='blue'><b>Darcy</b></font>) nearer with virtue than with any other feeling. But we are
none of us consistent, and in his (<font color='blue'><b>Darcy</b></font>) behaviour to me there were stronger
impulses even than pride.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Wickham/Mr. Wickham</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Can such abominable pride as his (<font color='blue'><b>Darcy</b></font>) have ever done him (<font color='blue'><b>Darcy</b></font>) good?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Yes. It has often led him (<font color='blue'><b>Darcy</b></font>) to be liberal and generous, to give his (<font color='blue'><b>Darcy</b></font>) money
freely, to display hospitality, to assist his (<font color='blue'><b>Darcy</b></font>) tenants, and relieve the
poor. Family pride, and _filial_ pride--for he (<font color='blue'><b>Darcy</b></font>) is very proud of what
his (<font color='blue'><b>Darcy</b></font>) father was--have done this. Not to appear to disgrace his (<font color='blue'><b>Darcy</b></font>) family,
to degenerate from the popular qualities, or lose the influence of the
Pemberley House, is a powerful motive. He (<font color='blue'><b>Darcy</b></font>) has also _brotherly_ pride,
which, with _some_ brotherly affection, makes him (<font color='blue'><b>Darcy</b></font>) a very kind and
careful guardian of his (<font color='blue'><b>Darcy</b></font>) sister, and you will hear him (<font color='blue'><b>Darcy</b></font>) generally cried up
as the most attentive and best of brothers.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``What sort of girl is Miss Darcy?''

 (<font color='red'><b>He</b></font>)</div><p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Wickham</b></font>) shook his (<font color='blue'><b>Wickham</b></font>) head. <div class="bookquote">``I wish I could call her (<font color='blue'><b>Darcy</b></font>) amiable. It gives me pain to
speak ill of a Darcy. But she (<font color='blue'><b>Darcy</b></font>) is too much like her (<font color='blue'><b>Darcy</b></font>) brother--very, very
proud. As a child, she (<font color='blue'><b>Darcy</b></font>) was affectionate and pleasing, and extremely fond
of me; and I have devoted hours and hours to her (<font color='blue'><b>Darcy</b></font>) amusement. But she (<font color='blue'><b>Darcy</b></font>) is
nothing to me now. She (<font color='blue'><b>Darcy</b></font>) is a handsome girl, about fifteen or sixteen,
and, I understand, highly accomplished. Since her (<font color='blue'><b>Darcy</b></font>) father's death, her (<font color='blue'><b>Darcy</b></font>)
home has been London, where a lady lives with her (<font color='blue'><b>Darcy</b></font>), and superintends her (<font color='blue'><b>Darcy</b></font>)
education.''

 (<font color='red'><b>subjects</b></font>)</div><p/>After many pauses and many trials of other subjects, Elizabeth could not
help reverting once more to the first, and saying:

<p/><div class="bookquote">``I am astonished at his (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) intimacy with Mr. Bingley! How can Mr. Bingley,
who seems good humour itself, and is, I really believe, truly amiable,
be in friendship with such a man? How can they suit each other? Do you
know Mr. Bingley?''

 (<font color='red'><b>Elizabeth/Miss Bennet/Miss Elizabeth</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Not at all.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``He (<font color='blue'><b>Bingley</b></font>) is a sweet-tempered, amiable, charming man. He (<font color='blue'><b>Bingley</b></font>) cannot know what Mr.
Darcy is.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Probably not; but Mr. Darcy can please where he (<font color='blue'><b>Darcy</b></font>) chooses. He (<font color='blue'><b>Darcy</b></font>) does not
want abilities. He (<font color='blue'><b>Darcy</b></font>) can be a conversible companion if he (<font color='blue'><b>Darcy</b></font>) thinks it worth
his (<font color='blue'><b>Darcy</b></font>) while. Among those who are at all his (<font color='blue'><b>Darcy</b></font>) equals in consequence, he (<font color='blue'><b>Darcy</b></font>) is
a very different man from what he (<font color='blue'><b>Darcy</b></font>) is to the less prosperous. His (<font color='blue'><b>Darcy</b></font>)
pride never deserts him (<font color='blue'><b>Darcy</b></font>); but with the rich he (<font color='blue'><b>Darcy</b></font>) is liberal-minded, just,
sincere, rational, honourable, and perhaps agreeable--allowing something
for fortune and figure.''

 (<font color='red'><b>The whist party Collins</b></font>)</div><p/>The whist party soon afterwards breaking up, the players gathered round
the other table and Mr. Collins took his (<font color='blue'><b>Collins</b></font>) station between his (<font color='blue'><b>Collins</b></font>) cousin
Elizabeth and Mrs. Phillips. The usual inquiries as to his (<font color='blue'><b>Collins</b></font>) success were
made by the latter. It had not been very great; he (<font color='blue'><b>Collins</b></font>) had lost every
point; but when Mrs. Phillips began to express her (<font color='blue'><b>Phillips</b></font>) concern thereupon,
he (<font color='blue'><b>Collins</b></font>) assured her (<font color='blue'><b>Phillips</b></font>) with much earnest gravity that it was not of the least
importance, that he (<font color='blue'><b>Collins</b></font>) considered the money as a mere trifle, and begged
that she (<font color='blue'><b>Phillips</b></font>) would not make herself uneasy.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``I know very well, madam,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>said he (<font color='blue'><b>Collins</b></font>), <div class="bookquote">``that when persons sit down to a
card-table, they must take their chances of these things, and happily I
am not in such circumstances as to make five shillings any object. There
are undoubtedly many who could not say the same, but thanks to Lady
Catherine de Bourgh, I am removed far beyond the necessity of regarding
little matters.''

 (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div><p/>Mr. Wickham's attention was caught; and after observing Mr. Collins for
a few moments, he (<font color='blue'><b>Collins</b></font>) asked Elizabeth in a low voice whether her (<font color='blue'><b>Elizabeth</b></font>) relation
was very intimately acquainted with the family of de Bourgh.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Lady Catherine de Bourgh,''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Elizabeth</b></font>) replied, <div class="bookquote">``has very lately given him (<font color='blue'><b>I</b></font>)
a living. I hardly know how Mr. Collins was first introduced to her (<font color='blue'><b>Bourgh</b></font>)
notice, but he (<font color='blue'><b>Collins</b></font>) certainly has not known her (<font color='blue'><b>Bourgh</b></font>) long.''

 (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``You know of course that Lady Catherine de Bourgh and Lady Anne Darcy
were sisters; consequently that she (<font color='blue'><b>Bourgh</b></font>) is aunt to the present Mr. Darcy.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``No, indeed, I did not. I knew nothing at all of Lady Catherine's
connections. I never heard of her (<font color='blue'><b>Catherine</b></font>) existence till the day before
yesterday.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Her (<font color='blue'><b>Catherine</b></font>) daughter, Miss de Bourgh, will have a very large fortune, and it is
believed that she (<font color='blue'><b>Bourgh</b></font>) and her (<font color='blue'><b>Bourgh</b></font>) cousin will unite the two estates.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Elizabeth/Miss Bennet/Miss Elizabeth</b></font>)</div><p/>This information made Elizabeth smile, as she (<font color='blue'><b>Elizabeth</b></font>) thought of poor Miss
Bingley. Vain indeed must be all her (<font color='blue'><b>Bingley</b></font>) attentions, vain and useless her (<font color='blue'><b>Bingley</b></font>)
affection for his (<font color='blue'><b>Collins</b></font>) sister and her (<font color='blue'><b>Bingley</b></font>) praise of himself, if he (<font color='blue'><b>Collins</b></font>) were already
self-destined for another.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Mr. Collins,''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>said she (<font color='blue'><b>Bingley</b></font>), <div class="bookquote">``speaks highly both of Lady Catherine and her (<font color='blue'><b>Catherine</b></font>)
daughter; but from some particulars that he (<font color='blue'><b>Collins</b></font>) has related of her (<font color='blue'><b>Catherine</b></font>) ladyship,
I suspect his (<font color='blue'><b>Collins</b></font>) gratitude misleads him (<font color='blue'><b>Collins</b></font>), and that in spite of her (<font color='blue'><b>Catherine</b></font>) being his (<font color='blue'><b>Collins</b></font>)
patroness, she (<font color='blue'><b>Catherine</b></font>) is an arrogant, conceited woman.''

 (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I believe her (<font color='blue'><b>Catherine</b></font>) to be both in a great degree,''  (<font color='red'><b>Wickham/Mr. Wickham</b></font>)</div>replied Wickham; <div class="bookquote">``I have
not seen her (<font color='blue'><b>Catherine</b></font>) for many years, but I very well remember that I never liked
her (<font color='blue'><b>Catherine</b></font>), and that her (<font color='blue'><b>Catherine</b></font>) manners were dictatorial and insolent. She (<font color='blue'><b>Catherine</b></font>) has the
reputation of being remarkably sensible and clever; but I rather believe
she (<font color='blue'><b>Catherine</b></font>) derives part of her (<font color='blue'><b>Catherine</b></font>) abilities from her (<font color='blue'><b>Catherine</b></font>) rank and fortune, part from
her (<font color='blue'><b>Catherine</b></font>) authoritative manner, and the rest from the pride for her (<font color='blue'><b>Catherine</b></font>)
nephew, who chooses that everyone connected with him (<font color='blue'><b>nephew</b></font>) should have an
understanding of the first class.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Wickham/Mr. Wickham</b></font>)</div><p/>Elizabeth allowed that he (<font color='blue'><b>Wickham</b></font>) had given a very rational account of it, and
they continued talking together, with mutual satisfaction till supper
put an end to cards, and gave the rest of the ladies their share of Mr.
Wickham's attentions. There could be no conversation in the noise
of Mrs. Phillips's supper party, but his (<font color='blue'><b>Wickham</b></font>) manners recommended him (<font color='blue'><b>Wickham</b></font>) to
everybody. Whatever he (<font color='blue'><b>Wickham</b></font>) said, was said well; and whatever he (<font color='blue'><b>Wickham</b></font>) did, done
gracefully. Elizabeth went away with her (<font color='blue'><b>Elizabeth</b></font>) head full of him (<font color='blue'><b>Wickham</b></font>). She (<font color='blue'><b>Elizabeth</b></font>) could
think of nothing but of Mr. Wickham, and of what he (<font color='blue'><b>Wickham</b></font>) had told her (<font color='blue'><b>Elizabeth</b></font>), all
the way home; but there was not time for her (<font color='blue'><b>Elizabeth</b></font>) even to mention his (<font color='blue'><b>Wickham</b></font>) name
as they went, for neither Lydia nor Mr. Collins were once silent. Lydia
talked incessantly of lottery tickets, of the fish she (<font color='blue'><b>Lydia</b></font>) had lost and the
fish she (<font color='blue'><b>Lydia</b></font>) had won; and Mr. Collins in describing the civility of Mr. and
Mrs. Phillips, protesting that he (<font color='blue'><b>Collins</b></font>) did not in the least regard his (<font color='blue'><b>Collins</b></font>) losses
at whist, enumerating all the dishes at supper, and repeatedly fearing
that he (<font color='blue'><b>Collins</b></font>) crowded his (<font color='blue'><b>Collins</b></font>) cousins, had more to say than he (<font color='blue'><b>Collins</b></font>) could well manage
before the carriage stopped at Longbourn House.



<p/>Chapter 17


<p/>Elizabeth related to Jane the next day what had passed between Mr.
Wickham and herself. Jane listened with astonishment and concern; she (<font color='blue'><b>Jane</b></font>)
knew not how to believe that Mr. Darcy could be so unworthy of Mr.
Bingley's regard; and yet, it was not in her (<font color='blue'><b>Jane</b></font>) nature to question the
veracity of a young man of such amiable appearance as Wickham. The
possibility of his (<font color='blue'><b>Wickham</b></font>) having endured such unkindness, was enough to
interest all her (<font color='blue'><b>Jane</b></font>) tender feelings; and nothing remained therefore to be
done, but to think well of them both, to defend the conduct of each,
and throw into the account of accident or mistake whatever could not be
otherwise explained.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``They have both,''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>said she (<font color='blue'><b>Jane</b></font>), <div class="bookquote">``been deceived, I dare say, in some way
or other, of which we can form no idea. Interested people have perhaps
misrepresented each to the other. It is, in short, impossible for us to
conjecture the causes or circumstances which may have alienated them,
without actual blame on either side.''

 (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Very true, indeed; and now, my dear Jane, what have you got to say on
behalf of the interested people who have probably been concerned in the
business? Do clear _them_ too, or we shall be obliged to think ill of
somebody.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Laugh as much as you choose, but you will not laugh me out of my
opinion. My dearest Lizzy, do but consider in what a disgraceful light
it places Mr. Darcy, to be treating his (<font color='blue'><b>Darcy</b></font>) father's favourite in such
a manner, one whom his (<font color='blue'><b>Darcy</b></font>) father had promised to provide for. It is
impossible. No man of common humanity, no man who had any value for his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>)
character, could be capable of it. Can his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) most intimate friends be so
excessively deceived in him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>)? Oh! no.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I can much more easily believe Mr. Bingley's being imposed on, than
that Mr. Wickham should invent such a history of himself as he (<font color='blue'><b>Wickham</b></font>) gave me
last night; names, facts, everything mentioned without ceremony. If it
be not so, let Mr. Darcy contradict it. Besides, there was truth in his (<font color='blue'><b>Darcy</b></font>)
looks.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``It is difficult indeed--it is distressing. One does not know what to
think.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I beg your pardon; one knows exactly what to think.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Jane</b></font>)</div><p/>But Jane could think with certainty on only one point--that Mr. Bingley,
if he (<font color='blue'><b>Bingley</b></font>) _had_ been imposed on, would have much to suffer when the affair
became public.

<p/>The two young ladies were summoned from the shrubbery, where this
conversation passed, by the arrival of the very persons of whom they had
been speaking; Mr. Bingley and his (<font color='blue'><b>Bingley</b></font>) sisters came to give their personal
invitation for the long-expected ball at Netherfield, which was fixed
for the following Tuesday. The two ladies were delighted to see their
dear friend again, called it an age since they had met, and repeatedly
asked what she (<font color='blue'><b>friend</b></font>) had been doing with herself since their separation. To
the rest of the family they paid little attention; avoiding Mrs. Bennet
as much as possible, saying not much to Elizabeth, and nothing at all to
the others. They were soon gone again, rising from their seats with an
activity which took their brother by surprise, and hurrying off as if
eager to escape from Mrs. Bennet's civilities.

<p/>The prospect of the Netherfield ball was extremely agreeable to every
female of the family. Mrs. Bennet chose to consider it as given in
compliment to her (<font color='blue'><b>Bennet</b></font>) eldest daughter, and was particularly flattered
by receiving the invitation from Mr. Bingley himself, instead of a
ceremonious card. Jane pictured to herself a happy evening in the
society of her (<font color='blue'><b>Jane</b></font>) two friends, and the attentions of their brother; and
Elizabeth thought with pleasure of dancing a great deal with Mr.
Wickham, and of seeing a confirmation of everything in Mr. Darcy's look
and behaviour. The happiness anticipated by Catherine and Lydia depended
less on any single event, or any particular person, for though they
each, like Elizabeth, meant to dance half the evening with Mr. Wickham,
he (<font color='blue'><b>Wickham</b></font>) was by no means the only partner who could satisfy them, and a ball
was, at any rate, a ball. And even Mary could assure her (<font color='blue'><b>Mary</b></font>) family that she (<font color='blue'><b>Mary</b></font>)
had no disinclination for it.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``While I can have my mornings to myself,''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>said she (<font color='blue'><b>Mary</b></font>), <div class="bookquote">``it is enough--I
think it is no sacrifice to join occasionally in evening engagements.
Society has claims on us all; and I profess myself one of those
who consider intervals of recreation and amusement as desirable for
everybody.''

 (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div><p/>Elizabeth's spirits were so high on this occasion, that though she (<font color='blue'><b>Elizabeth</b></font>) did
not often speak unnecessarily to Mr. Collins, she (<font color='blue'><b>Elizabeth</b></font>) could not help asking
him (<font color='blue'><b>Collins</b></font>) whether he (<font color='blue'><b>Collins</b></font>) intended to accept Mr. Bingley's invitation, and if
he (<font color='blue'><b>Bingley</b></font>) did, whether he (<font color='blue'><b>Bingley</b></font>) would think it proper to join in the evening's
amusement; and she (<font color='blue'><b>Elizabeth</b></font>) was rather surprised to find that he (<font color='blue'><b>Bingley</b></font>) entertained no
scruple whatever on that head, and was very far from dreading a rebuke
either from the Archbishop, or Lady Catherine de Bourgh, by venturing to
dance.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``I am by no means of the opinion, I assure you,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>said he (<font color='blue'><b>Archbishop</b></font>), <div class="bookquote">``that a ball
of this kind, given by a young man of character, to respectable people,
can have any evil tendency; and I am so far from objecting to dancing
myself, that I shall hope to be honoured with the hands of all my fair
cousins in the course of the evening; and I take this opportunity of
soliciting yours, Miss Elizabeth, for the two first dances especially,
a preference which I trust my cousin Jane will attribute to the right
cause, and not to any disrespect for her (<font color='blue'><b>Jane</b></font>).''

 (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div><p/>Elizabeth felt herself completely taken in. She (<font color='blue'><b>Elizabeth</b></font>) had fully proposed being
engaged by Mr. Wickham for those very dances; and to have Mr. Collins
instead! her (<font color='blue'><b>Elizabeth</b></font>) liveliness had never been worse timed. There was no help
for it, however. Mr. Wickham's happiness and her (<font color='blue'><b>Elizabeth</b></font>) own were perforce
delayed a little longer, and Mr. Collins's proposal accepted with as
good a grace as she (<font color='blue'><b>Elizabeth</b></font>) could. She (<font color='blue'><b>Elizabeth</b></font>) was not the better pleased with his (<font color='blue'><b>Collins</b></font>)
gallantry from the idea it suggested of something more. It now first
struck her (<font color='blue'><b>Elizabeth</b></font>), that _she (<font color='blue'><b>Elizabeth</b></font>)_ was selected from among her (<font color='blue'><b>Elizabeth</b></font>) sisters as worthy
of being mistress of Hunsford Parsonage, and of assisting to form a
quadrille table at Rosings, in the absence of more eligible visitors.
The idea soon reached to conviction, as she (<font color='blue'><b>Elizabeth</b></font>) observed his (<font color='blue'><b>Collins</b></font>) increasing
civilities toward herself, and heard his (<font color='blue'><b>Collins</b></font>) frequent attempt at a
compliment on her (<font color='blue'><b>Elizabeth</b></font>) wit and vivacity; and though more astonished than
gratified herself by this effect of her (<font color='blue'><b>Elizabeth</b></font>) charms, it was not long before
her (<font color='blue'><b>Elizabeth</b></font>) mother gave her (<font color='blue'><b>Elizabeth</b></font>) to understand that the probability of their marriage
was extremely agreeable to _her (<font color='blue'><b>Elizabeth</b></font>)_. Elizabeth, however, did not choose
to take the hint, being well aware that a serious dispute must be the
consequence of any reply. Mr. Collins might never make the offer, and
till he (<font color='blue'><b>Collins</b></font>) did, it was useless to quarrel about him (<font color='blue'><b>Collins</b></font>).

<p/>If there had not been a Netherfield ball to prepare for and talk of, the
younger Miss Bennets would have been in a very pitiable state at this
time, for from the day of the invitation, to the day of the ball, there
was such a succession of rain as prevented their walking to Meryton
once. No aunt, no officers, no news could be sought after--the very
shoe-roses for Netherfield were got by proxy. Even Elizabeth might have
found some trial of her (<font color='blue'><b>Elizabeth</b></font>) patience in weather which totally suspended the
improvement of her (<font color='blue'><b>Elizabeth</b></font>) acquaintance with Mr. Wickham; and nothing less than
a dance on Tuesday, could have made such a Friday, Saturday, Sunday, and
Monday endurable to Kitty and Lydia.



<p/>Chapter 18


<p/>Till Elizabeth entered the drawing-room at Netherfield, and looked in
vain for Mr. Wickham among the cluster of red coats there assembled, a
doubt of his (<font color='blue'><b>Wickham</b></font>) being present had never occurred to her (<font color='blue'><b>Elizabeth</b></font>). The certainty
of meeting him (<font color='blue'><b>Wickham</b></font>) had not been checked by any of those recollections that
might not unreasonably have alarmed her (<font color='blue'><b>Elizabeth</b></font>). She (<font color='blue'><b>Elizabeth</b></font>) had dressed with more than
usual care, and prepared in the highest spirits for the conquest of all
that remained unsubdued of his (<font color='blue'><b>Wickham</b></font>) heart, trusting that it was not more than
might be won in the course of the evening. But in an instant arose
the dreadful suspicion of his (<font color='blue'><b>Wickham</b></font>) being purposely omitted for Mr. Darcy's
pleasure in the Bingleys' invitation to the officers; and though
this was not exactly the case, the absolute fact of his (<font color='blue'><b>Wickham</b></font>) absence was
pronounced by his (<font color='blue'><b>Wickham</b></font>) friend Denny, to whom Lydia eagerly applied, and who
told them that Wickham had been obliged to go to town on business the
day before, and was not yet returned; adding, with a significant smile,
<div class="bookquote">``I do not imagine his (<font color='blue'><b>cousin</b></font>) business would have called him (<font color='blue'><b>cousin</b></font>) away just now, if
he (<font color='blue'><b>cousin</b></font>) had not wanted to avoid a certain gentleman here.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Wickham/Mr. Wickham</b></font>)</div><p/>This part of his (<font color='blue'><b>Wickham</b></font>) intelligence, though unheard by Lydia, was caught by
Elizabeth, and, as it assured her (<font color='blue'><b>Elizabeth</b></font>) that Darcy was not less answerable for
Wickham's absence than if her (<font color='blue'><b>Elizabeth</b></font>) first surmise had been just, every
feeling of displeasure against the former was so sharpened by immediate
disappointment, that she (<font color='blue'><b>Elizabeth</b></font>) could hardly reply with tolerable civility to
the polite inquiries which he (<font color='blue'><b>Wickham</b></font>) directly afterwards approached to make.
Attendance, forbearance, patience with Darcy, was injury to Wickham. She (<font color='blue'><b>Elizabeth</b></font>)
was resolved against any sort of conversation with him (<font color='blue'><b>Wickham</b></font>), and turned away
with a degree of ill-humour which she (<font color='blue'><b>Elizabeth</b></font>) could not wholly surmount even in
speaking to Mr. Bingley, whose blind partiality provoked her (<font color='blue'><b>Elizabeth</b></font>).

<p/>But Elizabeth was not formed for ill-humour; and though every prospect
of her (<font color='blue'><b>Elizabeth</b></font>) own was destroyed for the evening, it could not dwell long on her (<font color='blue'><b>Elizabeth</b></font>)
spirits; and having told all her (<font color='blue'><b>Elizabeth</b></font>) griefs to Charlotte Lucas, whom she (<font color='blue'><b>Elizabeth</b></font>) had
not seen for a week, she (<font color='blue'><b>Elizabeth</b></font>) was soon able to make a voluntary transition
to the oddities of her (<font color='blue'><b>Elizabeth</b></font>) cousin, and to point him (<font color='blue'><b>cousin</b></font>) out to her (<font color='blue'><b>Elizabeth</b></font>) particular
notice. The first two dances, however, brought a return of distress;
they were dances of mortification. Mr. Collins, awkward and solemn,
apologising instead of attending, and often moving wrong without being
aware of it, gave her (<font color='blue'><b>Elizabeth</b></font>) all the shame and misery which a disagreeable
partner for a couple of dances can give. The moment of her (<font color='blue'><b>Elizabeth</b></font>) release from
him (<font color='blue'><b>Collins</b></font>) was ecstasy.

<p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>Elizabeth</b></font>) danced next with an officer, and had the refreshment of talking of
Wickham, and of hearing that he (<font color='blue'><b>Wickham</b></font>) was universally liked. When those dances
were over, she (<font color='blue'><b>Elizabeth</b></font>) returned to Charlotte Lucas, and was in conversation with
her (<font color='blue'><b>Elizabeth</b></font>), when she (<font color='blue'><b>Elizabeth</b></font>) found herself suddenly addressed by Mr. Darcy who took
her (<font color='blue'><b>Elizabeth</b></font>) so much by surprise in his (<font color='blue'><b>Darcy</b></font>) application for her (<font color='blue'><b>Elizabeth</b></font>) hand, that,
without knowing what she (<font color='blue'><b>Elizabeth</b></font>) did, she (<font color='blue'><b>Elizabeth</b></font>) accepted him (<font color='blue'><b>Darcy</b></font>). He (<font color='blue'><b>Darcy</b></font>) walked away again
immediately, and she (<font color='blue'><b>Elizabeth</b></font>) was left to fret over her (<font color='blue'><b>Elizabeth</b></font>) own want of presence of
mind; Charlotte tried to console her (<font color='blue'><b>Charlotte</b></font>):

<p/><div class="bookquote">``I dare say you will find him (<font color='blue'><b>cousin</b></font>) very agreeable.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Charlotte</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Heaven forbid! _That_ would be the greatest misfortune of all! To find
a man agreeable whom one is determined to hate! Do not wish me such an
evil.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Darcy/Darcy</b></font>)</div><p/>When the dancing recommenced, however, and Darcy approached to claim her (<font color='blue'><b>Charlotte</b></font>)
hand, Charlotte could not help cautioning her (<font color='blue'><b>Charlotte</b></font>) in a whisper, not to be a
simpleton, and allow her (<font color='blue'><b>Charlotte</b></font>) fancy for Wickham to make her (<font color='blue'><b>Charlotte</b></font>) appear unpleasant
in the eyes of a man ten times his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) consequence. Elizabeth made no
answer, and took her (<font color='blue'><b>Elizabeth</b></font>) place in the set, amazed at the dignity to which
she (<font color='blue'><b>Elizabeth</b></font>) was arrived in being allowed to stand opposite to Mr. Darcy, and
reading in her (<font color='blue'><b>Elizabeth</b></font>) neighbours' looks, their equal amazement in beholding
it. They stood for some time without speaking a word; and she (<font color='blue'><b>Elizabeth</b></font>) began to
imagine that their silence was to last through the two dances, and at
first was resolved not to break it; till suddenly fancying that it would
be the greater punishment to her (<font color='blue'><b>Elizabeth</b></font>) partner to oblige him (<font color='blue'><b>Darcy</b></font>) to talk, she (<font color='blue'><b>Elizabeth</b></font>) made
some slight observation on the dance. He (<font color='blue'><b>Darcy</b></font>) replied, and was again
silent. After a pause of some minutes, she (<font color='blue'><b>Elizabeth</b></font>) addressed him (<font color='blue'><b>Darcy</b></font>) a second time
with:--<div class="bookquote">``It is _your_ turn to say something now, Mr. Darcy. I talked
about the dance, and _you_ ought to make some sort of remark on the size
of the room, or the number of couples.''

 (<font color='red'><b>him</b></font>)</div><p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Darcy</b></font>) smiled, and assured her (<font color='blue'><b>Elizabeth</b></font>) that whatever she (<font color='blue'><b>Elizabeth</b></font>) wished him (<font color='blue'><b>Darcy</b></font>) to say should be
said.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Very well. That reply will do for the present. Perhaps by and by I may
observe that private balls are much pleasanter than public ones. But
_now_ we may be silent.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Do you talk by rule, then, while you are dancing?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Sometimes. One must speak a little, you know. It would look odd to be
entirely silent for half an hour together; and yet for the advantage of
_some_, conversation ought to be so arranged, as that they may have the
trouble of saying as little as possible.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Are you consulting your own feelings in the present case, or do you
imagine that you are gratifying mine?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Both,''  (<font color='red'><b>Elizabeth/Miss Bennet/Miss Elizabeth</b></font>)</div>replied Elizabeth archly; <div class="bookquote">``for I have always seen a great
similarity in the turn of our minds. We are each of an unsocial,
taciturn disposition, unwilling to speak, unless we expect to say
something that will amaze the whole room, and be handed down to
posterity with all the eclat of a proverb.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Elizabeth/Miss Bennet/Miss Elizabeth</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``This is no very striking resemblance of your own character, I am sure,''
 (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>said he (<font color='blue'><b>Darcy</b></font>). <div class="bookquote">``How near it may be to _mine_, I cannot pretend to say. _You_
think it a faithful portrait undoubtedly.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I must not decide on my own performance.''

 (<font color='red'><b>He</b></font>)</div><p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Darcy</b></font>) made no answer, and they were again silent till they had gone down
the dance, when he (<font color='blue'><b>Darcy</b></font>) asked her (<font color='blue'><b>Elizabeth</b></font>) if she (<font color='blue'><b>Elizabeth</b></font>) and her (<font color='blue'><b>Elizabeth</b></font>) sisters did not very often
walk to Meryton. She (<font color='blue'><b>Elizabeth</b></font>) answered in the affirmative, and, unable to resist
the temptation, added, <div class="bookquote">``When you met us there the other day, we had just
been forming a new acquaintance.''

 (<font color='red'><b>She</b></font>)</div><p/>The effect was immediate. A deeper shade of _hauteur_ overspread his (<font color='blue'><b>Darcy</b></font>)
features, but he (<font color='blue'><b>Darcy</b></font>) said not a word, and Elizabeth, though blaming herself
for her (<font color='blue'><b>Elizabeth</b></font>) own weakness, could not go on. At length Darcy spoke, and in a
constrained manner said, <div class="bookquote">``Mr. Wickham is blessed with such happy manners
as may ensure his (<font color='blue'><b>Wickham</b></font>) _making_ friends--whether he (<font color='blue'><b>Wickham</b></font>) may be equally capable of
_retaining_ them, is less certain.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Darcy/Darcy</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``He (<font color='blue'><b>Wickham</b></font>) has been so unlucky as to lose _your_ friendship,''  (<font color='red'><b>Elizabeth/Miss Bennet/Miss Elizabeth</b></font>)</div>replied Elizabeth
with emphasis, <div class="bookquote">``and in a manner which he (<font color='blue'><b>Wickham</b></font>) is likely to suffer from all
his (<font color='blue'><b>Wickham</b></font>) life.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Elizabeth/Miss Bennet/Miss Elizabeth</b></font>)</div><p/>Darcy made no answer, and seemed desirous of changing the subject. At
that moment, Sir William Lucas appeared close to them, meaning to pass
through the set to the other side of the room; but on perceiving Mr.
Darcy, he (<font color='blue'><b>Darcy</b></font>) stopped with a bow of superior courtesy to compliment him (<font color='blue'><b>Darcy</b></font>) on
his (<font color='blue'><b>Darcy</b></font>) dancing and his (<font color='blue'><b>Darcy</b></font>) partner.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``I have been most highly gratified indeed, my dear sir. Such very
superior dancing is not often seen. It is evident that you belong to the
first circles. Allow me to say, however, that your fair partner does not
disgrace you, and that I must hope to have this pleasure often repeated,
especially when a certain desirable event, my dear Eliza -LRB-glancing at
her (<font color='blue'><b>Eliza</b></font>) sister and Bingley-RRB- shall take place. What congratulations will then
flow in! I appeal to Mr. Darcy:--but let me not interrupt you, sir. You
will not thank me for detaining you from the bewitching converse of that
young lady, whose bright eyes are also upbraiding me.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Darcy/Darcy</b></font>)</div><p/>The latter part of this address was scarcely heard by Darcy; but Sir
William's allusion to his (<font color='blue'><b>Darcy</b></font>) friend seemed to strike him (<font color='blue'><b>Darcy</b></font>) forcibly, and his (<font color='blue'><b>Darcy</b></font>)
eyes were directed with a very serious expression towards Bingley and
Jane, who were dancing together. Recovering himself, however, shortly,
he (<font color='blue'><b>Darcy</b></font>) turned to his (<font color='blue'><b>Darcy</b></font>) partner, and said, <div class="bookquote">``Sir William's interruption has made
me forget what we were talking of.''

 (<font color='red'><b>partner</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I do not think we were speaking at all. Sir William could not have
interrupted two people in the room who had less to say for themselves.
We have tried two or three subjects already without success, and what we
are to talk of next I cannot imagine.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``What think you of books?''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>said he (<font color='blue'><b>Darcy</b></font>), smiling.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Books--oh! no. I am sure we never read the same, or not with the same
feelings.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I am sorry you think so; but if that be the case, there can at least be
no want of subject. We may compare our different opinions.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``No--I cannot talk of books in a ball-room; my head is always full of
something else.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``The _present_ always occupies you in such scenes--does it?''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>said he (<font color='blue'><b>Darcy</b></font>),
with a look of doubt.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Yes, always,''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Jane</b></font>) replied, without knowing what she (<font color='blue'><b>Jane</b></font>) said, for her (<font color='blue'><b>Jane</b></font>)
thoughts had wandered far from the subject, as soon afterwards appeared
by her (<font color='blue'><b>Jane</b></font>) suddenly exclaiming, <div class="bookquote">``I remember hearing you once say, Mr. Darcy,
that you hardly ever forgave, that your resentment once created was
unappeasable. You are very cautious, I suppose, as to its _being
created_.''

 (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I am,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>said he (<font color='blue'><b>Darcy</b></font>), with a firm voice.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``And never allow yourself to be blinded by prejudice?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I hope not.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``It is particularly incumbent on those who never change their opinion,
to be secure of judging properly at first.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``May I ask to what these questions tend?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Merely to the illustration of _your_ character,''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>said she (<font color='blue'><b>Jane</b></font>), endeavouring
to shake off her (<font color='blue'><b>Jane</b></font>) gravity. <div class="bookquote">``I am trying to make it out.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``And what is your success?''

 (<font color='red'><b>She</b></font>)</div><p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>Jane</b></font>) shook her (<font color='blue'><b>Jane</b></font>) head. <div class="bookquote">``I do not get on at all. I hear such different
accounts of you as puzzle me exceedingly.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I can readily believe,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>answered he (<font color='blue'><b>Darcy</b></font>) gravely, <div class="bookquote">``that reports may vary
greatly with respect to me; and I could wish, Miss Bennet, that you were
not to sketch my character at the present moment, as there is reason to
fear that the performance would reflect no credit on either.''

 (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``But if I do not take your likeness now, I may never have another
opportunity.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I would by no means suspend any pleasure of yours,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Darcy</b></font>) coldly replied.
She (<font color='blue'><b>Jane</b></font>) said no more, and they went down the other dance and parted in
silence; and on each side dissatisfied, though not to an equal degree,
for in Darcy's breast there was a tolerably powerful feeling towards
her (<font color='blue'><b>Jane</b></font>), which soon procured her (<font color='blue'><b>Jane</b></font>) pardon, and directed all his (<font color='blue'><b>Darcy</b></font>) anger against
another.

<p/>They had not long separated, when Miss Bingley came towards her (<font color='blue'><b>Bingley</b></font>), and
with an expression of civil disdain accosted her (<font color='blue'><b>Bingley</b></font>):

<p/><div class="bookquote">``So, Miss Eliza, I hear you are quite delighted with George Wickham!
Your sister has been talking to me about him (<font color='blue'><b>Wickham</b></font>), and asking me a thousand
questions; and I find that the young man quite forgot to tell you, among
his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) other communication, that he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) was the son of old Wickham, the late
Mr. Darcy's steward. Let me recommend you, however, as a friend, not to
give implicit confidence to all his (<font color='blue'><b>friend</b></font>) assertions; for as to Mr. Darcy's
using him (<font color='blue'><b>Darcy</b></font>) ill, it is perfectly false; for, on the contrary, he (<font color='blue'><b>Darcy</b></font>) has
always been remarkably kind to him (<font color='blue'><b>Darcy</b></font>), though George Wickham has treated
Mr. Darcy in a most infamous manner. I do not know the particulars, but
I know very well that Mr. Darcy is not in the least to blame, that he (<font color='blue'><b>Darcy</b></font>)
cannot bear to hear George Wickham mentioned, and that though my brother
thought that he (<font color='blue'><b>Wickham</b></font>) could not well avoid including him (<font color='blue'><b>Wickham</b></font>) in his (<font color='blue'><b>Wickham</b></font>) invitation to
the officers, he (<font color='blue'><b>Wickham</b></font>) was excessively glad to find that he (<font color='blue'><b>Wickham</b></font>) had taken himself
out of the way. His (<font color='blue'><b>Wickham</b></font>) coming into the country at all is a most insolent
thing, indeed, and I wonder how he (<font color='blue'><b>Wickham</b></font>) could presume to do it. I pity you,
Miss Eliza, for this discovery of your favourite's guilt; but really,
considering his (<font color='blue'><b>Wickham</b></font>) descent, one could not expect much better.''

 (<font color='red'><b>her</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``His (<font color='blue'><b>Wickham</b></font>) guilt and his (<font color='blue'><b>Wickham</b></font>) descent appear by your account to be the same,''  (<font color='red'><b>Elizabeth/Miss Bennet/Miss Elizabeth</b></font>)</div>said
Elizabeth angrily; <div class="bookquote">``for I have heard you accuse him (<font color='blue'><b>Wickham</b></font>) of nothing worse
than of being the son of Mr. Darcy's steward, and of _that_, I can
assure you, he (<font color='blue'><b>Darcy</b></font>) informed me himself.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Elizabeth/Miss Bennet/Miss Elizabeth</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I beg your pardon,''  (<font color='red'><b>Miss Bingley</b></font>)</div>replied Miss Bingley, turning away with a sneer.
<div class="bookquote">``Excuse my interference--it was kindly meant.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Insolent girl!''  (<font color='red'><b>Elizabeth/Miss Bennet/Miss Elizabeth</b></font>)</div>said Elizabeth to herself. <div class="bookquote">``You are much mistaken
if you expect to influence me by such a paltry attack as this. I see
nothing in it but your own wilful ignorance and the malice of Mr.
Darcy.''  (<font color='red'><b>She</b></font>)</div>She (<font color='blue'><b>Elizabeth</b></font>) then sought her (<font color='blue'><b>Elizabeth</b></font>) eldest sister, who had undertaken to make
inquiries on the same subject of Bingley. Jane met her (<font color='blue'><b>Jane</b></font>) with a smile of
such sweet complacency, a glow of such happy expression, as sufficiently
marked how well she (<font color='blue'><b>Jane</b></font>) was satisfied with the occurrences of the evening.
Elizabeth instantly read her (<font color='blue'><b>Elizabeth</b></font>) feelings, and at that moment solicitude for
Wickham, resentment against his (<font color='blue'><b>Wickham</b></font>) enemies, and everything else, gave way
before the hope of Jane's being in the fairest way for happiness.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``I want to know,''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>said she (<font color='blue'><b>Jane</b></font>), with a countenance no less smiling than her (<font color='blue'><b>Jane</b></font>)
sister's, <div class="bookquote">``what you have learnt about Mr. Wickham. But perhaps you have
been too pleasantly engaged to think of any third person; in which case
you may be sure of my pardon.''

 (<font color='red'><b>sister</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``No,''  (<font color='red'><b>Jane</b></font>)</div>replied Jane, <div class="bookquote">``I have not forgotten him (<font color='blue'><b>Wickham</b></font>); but I have nothing
satisfactory to tell you. Mr. Bingley does not know the whole of
his (<font color='blue'><b>Bingley</b></font>) history, and is quite ignorant of the circumstances which have
principally offended Mr. Darcy; but he (<font color='blue'><b>Darcy</b></font>) will vouch for the good conduct,
the probity, and honour of his (<font color='blue'><b>Darcy</b></font>) friend, and is perfectly convinced that
Mr. Wickham has deserved much less attention from Mr. Darcy than he (<font color='blue'><b>Darcy</b></font>) has
received; and I am sorry to say by his (<font color='blue'><b>Darcy</b></font>) account as well as his (<font color='blue'><b>Darcy</b></font>) sister's,
Mr. Wickham is by no means a respectable young man. I am afraid he (<font color='blue'><b>Wickham</b></font>) has
been very imprudent, and has deserved to lose Mr. Darcy's regard.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Jane</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Mr. Bingley does not know Mr. Wickham himself?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``No; he (<font color='blue'><b>Bingley</b></font>) never saw him (<font color='blue'><b>Bingley</b></font>) till the other morning at Meryton.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``This account then is what he (<font color='blue'><b>Bingley</b></font>) has received from Mr. Darcy. I am
satisfied. But what does he (<font color='blue'><b>Darcy</b></font>) say of the living?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``He (<font color='blue'><b>Darcy</b></font>) does not exactly recollect the circumstances, though he (<font color='blue'><b>Darcy</b></font>) has heard
them from Mr. Darcy more than once, but he (<font color='blue'><b>Darcy</b></font>) believes that it was left to
him (<font color='blue'><b>Darcy</b></font>) _conditionally_ only.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I have not a doubt of Mr. Bingley's sincerity,''  (<font color='red'><b>Elizabeth/Miss Bennet/Miss Elizabeth</b></font>)</div>said Elizabeth warmly;
<div class="bookquote">``but you must excuse my not being convinced by assurances only. Mr.
Bingley's defense of his (<font color='blue'><b>Bingley</b></font>) friend was a very able one, I dare say; but
since he (<font color='blue'><b>Bingley</b></font>) is unacquainted with several parts of the story, and has learnt
the rest from that friend himself, I shall venture to still think of
both gentlemen as I did before.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Elizabeth/Miss Bennet/Miss Elizabeth</b></font>)</div><p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>Elizabeth</b></font>) then changed the discourse to one more gratifying to each, and on
which there could be no difference of sentiment. Elizabeth listened with
delight to the happy, though modest hopes which Jane entertained of Mr.
Bingley's regard, and said all in her (<font color='blue'><b>Jane</b></font>) power to heighten her (<font color='blue'><b>Jane</b></font>) confidence
in it. On their being joined by Mr. Bingley himself, Elizabeth withdrew
to Miss Lucas; to whose inquiry after the pleasantness of her (<font color='blue'><b>Elizabeth</b></font>) last
partner she (<font color='blue'><b>Elizabeth</b></font>) had scarcely replied, before Mr. Collins came up to them,
and told her (<font color='blue'><b>Elizabeth</b></font>) with great exultation that he (<font color='blue'><b>Collins</b></font>) had just been so fortunate as
to make a most important discovery.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``I have found out,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>said he (<font color='blue'><b>Collins</b></font>), <div class="bookquote">``by a singular accident, that there is now
in the room a near relation of my patroness. I happened to overhear the
gentleman himself mentioning to the young lady who does the honours of
the house the names of his (<font color='blue'><b>gentleman</b></font>) cousin Miss de Bourgh, and of her (<font color='blue'><b>Bourgh</b></font>) mother Lady
Catherine. How wonderfully these sort of things occur! Who would have
thought of my meeting with, perhaps, a nephew of Lady Catherine de
Bourgh in this assembly! I am most thankful that the discovery is made
in time for me to pay my respects to him (<font color='blue'><b>nephew</b></font>), which I am now going to
do, and trust he (<font color='blue'><b>nephew</b></font>) will excuse my not having done it before. My total
ignorance of the connection must plead my apology.''

 (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``You are not going to introduce yourself to Mr. Darcy!''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Indeed I am. I shall entreat his (<font color='blue'><b>Darcy</b></font>) pardon for not having done it earlier.
I believe him (<font color='blue'><b>Darcy</b></font>) to be Lady Catherine's _nephew_. It will be in my power to
assure him (<font color='blue'><b>Darcy</b></font>) that her (<font color='blue'><b>Catherine</b></font>) ladyship was quite well yesterday se`nnight.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Elizabeth/Miss Bennet/Miss Elizabeth</b></font>)</div><p/>Elizabeth tried hard to dissuade him (<font color='blue'><b>Collins</b></font>) from such a scheme, assuring him (<font color='blue'><b>Collins</b></font>)
that Mr. Darcy would consider his (<font color='blue'><b>Darcy</b></font>) addressing him (<font color='blue'><b>Darcy</b></font>) without introduction
as an impertinent freedom, rather than a compliment to his (<font color='blue'><b>Darcy</b></font>) aunt; that
it was not in the least necessary there should be any notice on either
side; and that if it were, it must belong to Mr. Darcy, the superior in
consequence, to begin the acquaintance. Mr. Collins listened to her (<font color='blue'><b>aunt</b></font>)
with the determined air of following his (<font color='blue'><b>Collins</b></font>) own inclination, and, when she (<font color='blue'><b>aunt</b></font>)
ceased speaking, replied thus:

<p/><div class="bookquote">``My dear Miss Elizabeth, I have the highest opinion in the world in
your excellent judgement in all matters within the scope of your
understanding; but permit me to say, that there must be a wide
difference between the established forms of ceremony amongst the laity,
and those which regulate the clergy; for, give me leave to observe that
I consider the clerical office as equal in point of dignity with
the highest rank in the kingdom--provided that a proper humility of
behaviour is at the same time maintained. You must therefore allow me to
follow the dictates of my conscience on this occasion, which leads me to
perform what I look on as a point of duty. Pardon me for neglecting to
profit by your advice, which on every other subject shall be my constant
guide, though in the case before us I consider myself more fitted by
education and habitual study to decide on what is right than a young
lady like yourself.''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>And with a low bow he (<font color='blue'><b>Collins</b></font>) left her (<font color='blue'><b>aunt</b></font>) to attack Mr.
Darcy, whose reception of his (<font color='blue'><b>Darcy</b></font>) advances she (<font color='blue'><b>aunt</b></font>) eagerly watched, and whose
astonishment at being so addressed was very evident. Her (<font color='blue'><b>aunt</b></font>) cousin prefaced
his (<font color='blue'><b>cousin</b></font>) speech with a solemn bow and though she (<font color='blue'><b>aunt</b></font>) could not hear a word of
it, she (<font color='blue'><b>aunt</b></font>) felt as if hearing it all, and saw in the motion of his (<font color='blue'><b>cousin</b></font>) lips the
words <div class="bookquote">``apology,''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``Hunsford,''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>and <div class="bookquote">``Lady Catherine de Bourgh.''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>It vexed
her (<font color='blue'><b>aunt</b></font>) to see him (<font color='blue'><b>cousin</b></font>) expose himself to such a man. Mr. Darcy was eyeing him (<font color='blue'><b>Darcy</b></font>)
with unrestrained wonder, and when at last Mr. Collins allowed him (<font color='blue'><b>Collins</b></font>) time
to speak, replied with an air of distant civility. Mr. Collins, however,
was not discouraged from speaking again, and Mr. Darcy's contempt seemed
abundantly increasing with the length of his (<font color='blue'><b>Darcy</b></font>) second speech, and at the
end of it he (<font color='blue'><b>Darcy</b></font>) only made him (<font color='blue'><b>Darcy</b></font>) a slight bow, and moved another way. Mr.
Collins then returned to Elizabeth.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``I have no reason, I assure you,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>said he (<font color='blue'><b>Collins</b></font>), <div class="bookquote">``to be dissatisfied with my
reception. Mr. Darcy seemed much pleased with the attention. He (<font color='blue'><b>Darcy</b></font>) answered
me with the utmost civility, and even paid me the compliment of saying
that he (<font color='blue'><b>Darcy</b></font>) was so well convinced of Lady Catherine's discernment as to be
certain she (<font color='blue'><b>Catherine</b></font>) could never bestow a favour unworthily. It was really a very
handsome thought. Upon the whole, I am much pleased with him (<font color='blue'><b>Darcy</b></font>).''

 (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div><p/>As Elizabeth had no longer any interest of her (<font color='blue'><b>Elizabeth</b></font>) own to pursue, she (<font color='blue'><b>Elizabeth</b></font>) turned
her (<font color='blue'><b>Elizabeth</b></font>) attention almost entirely on her (<font color='blue'><b>Elizabeth</b></font>) sister and Mr. Bingley; and the
train of agreeable reflections which her (<font color='blue'><b>Elizabeth</b></font>) observations gave birth to,
made her (<font color='blue'><b>Elizabeth</b></font>) perhaps almost as happy as Jane. She (<font color='blue'><b>Elizabeth</b></font>) saw her (<font color='blue'><b>Elizabeth</b></font>) in idea settled in
that very house, in all the felicity which a marriage of true affection
could bestow; and she (<font color='blue'><b>Elizabeth</b></font>) felt capable, under such circumstances, of
endeavouring even to like Bingley's two sisters. Her (<font color='blue'><b>Elizabeth</b></font>) mother's thoughts
she (<font color='blue'><b>Elizabeth</b></font>) plainly saw were bent the same way, and she (<font color='blue'><b>Elizabeth</b></font>) determined not to
venture near her (<font color='blue'><b>Elizabeth</b></font>), lest she (<font color='blue'><b>Elizabeth</b></font>) might hear too much. When they sat down to
supper, therefore, she (<font color='blue'><b>Elizabeth</b></font>) considered it a most unlucky perverseness which
placed them within one of each other; and deeply was she (<font color='blue'><b>Elizabeth</b></font>) vexed to find
that her (<font color='blue'><b>Elizabeth</b></font>) mother was talking to that one person -LRB-Lady Lucas-RRB- freely,
openly, and of nothing else but her (<font color='blue'><b>Lucas</b></font>) expectation that Jane would soon
be married to Mr. Bingley. It was an animating subject, and Mrs. Bennet
seemed incapable of fatigue while enumerating the advantages of the
match. His (<font color='blue'><b>Bingley</b></font>) being such a charming young man, and so rich, and living but
three miles from them, were the first points of self-gratulation; and
then it was such a comfort to think how fond the two sisters were of
Jane, and to be certain that they must desire the connection as much as
she (<font color='blue'><b>Jane</b></font>) could do. It was, moreover, such a promising thing for her (<font color='blue'><b>Jane</b></font>) younger
daughters, as Jane's marrying so greatly must throw them in the way of
other rich men; and lastly, it was so pleasant at her (<font color='blue'><b>Jane</b></font>) time of life to be
able to consign her (<font color='blue'><b>Jane</b></font>) single daughters to the care of their sister, that
she (<font color='blue'><b>Jane</b></font>) might not be obliged to go into company more than she (<font color='blue'><b>Jane</b></font>) liked. It was
necessary to make this circumstance a matter of pleasure, because on
such occasions it is the etiquette; but no one was less likely than Mrs.
Bennet to find comfort in staying home at any period of her (<font color='blue'><b>Bennet</b></font>) life. She (<font color='blue'><b>Bennet</b></font>)
concluded with many good wishes that Lady Lucas might soon be equally
fortunate, though evidently and triumphantly believing there was no
chance of it.

<p/>In vain did Elizabeth endeavour to check the rapidity of her (<font color='blue'><b>Elizabeth</b></font>) mother's
words, or persuade her (<font color='blue'><b>Elizabeth</b></font>) to describe her (<font color='blue'><b>Elizabeth</b></font>) felicity in a less audible
whisper; for, to her (<font color='blue'><b>Elizabeth</b></font>) inexpressible vexation, she (<font color='blue'><b>Elizabeth</b></font>) could perceive that the
chief of it was overheard by Mr. Darcy, who sat opposite to them. Her (<font color='blue'><b>Elizabeth</b></font>)
mother only scolded her (<font color='blue'><b>Elizabeth</b></font>) for being nonsensical.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``What is Mr. Darcy to me, pray, that I should be afraid of him (<font color='blue'><b>Darcy</b></font>)? I am
sure we owe him (<font color='blue'><b>Darcy</b></font>) no such particular civility as to be obliged to say
nothing _he (<font color='blue'><b>Darcy</b></font>)_ may not like to hear.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``For heaven's sake, madam, speak lower. What advantage can it be for you
to offend Mr. Darcy? You will never recommend yourself to his (<font color='blue'><b>Darcy</b></font>) friend by
so doing!''

 (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div><p/>Nothing that she (<font color='blue'><b>Elizabeth</b></font>) could say, however, had any influence. Her (<font color='blue'><b>Elizabeth</b></font>) mother would
talk of her (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) views in the same intelligible tone. Elizabeth blushed and
blushed again with shame and vexation. She (<font color='blue'><b>Elizabeth</b></font>) could not help frequently
glancing her (<font color='blue'><b>Elizabeth</b></font>) eye at Mr. Darcy, though every glance convinced her (<font color='blue'><b>Elizabeth</b></font>) of what
she (<font color='blue'><b>Elizabeth</b></font>) dreaded; for though he (<font color='blue'><b>Darcy</b></font>) was not always looking at her (<font color='blue'><b>Elizabeth</b></font>) mother, she (<font color='blue'><b>Elizabeth</b></font>) was
convinced that his (<font color='blue'><b>Darcy</b></font>) attention was invariably fixed by her (<font color='blue'><b>Elizabeth</b></font>). The expression
of his (<font color='blue'><b>Darcy</b></font>) face changed gradually from indignant contempt to a composed and
steady gravity.

<p/>At length, however, Mrs. Bennet had no more to say; and Lady Lucas, who
had been long yawning at the repetition of delights which she (<font color='blue'><b>Lucas</b></font>) saw no
likelihood of sharing, was left to the comforts of cold ham and
chicken. Elizabeth now began to revive. But not long was the interval of
tranquillity; for, when supper was over, singing was talked of, and
she (<font color='blue'><b>Elizabeth</b></font>) had the mortification of seeing Mary, after very little entreaty,
preparing to oblige the company. By many significant looks and silent
entreaties, did she (<font color='blue'><b>Mary</b></font>) endeavour to prevent such a proof of complaisance,
but in vain; Mary would not understand them; such an opportunity of
exhibiting was delightful to her (<font color='blue'><b>Mary</b></font>), and she (<font color='blue'><b>Mary</b></font>) began her (<font color='blue'><b>Mary</b></font>) song. Elizabeth's
eyes were fixed on her (<font color='blue'><b>Mary</b></font>) with most painful sensations, and she (<font color='blue'><b>Mary</b></font>) watched her (<font color='blue'><b>Mary</b></font>)
progress through the several stanzas with an impatience which was very
ill rewarded at their close; for Mary, on receiving, amongst the thanks
of the table, the hint of a hope that she (<font color='blue'><b>Mary</b></font>) might be prevailed on to
favour them again, after the pause of half a minute began another.
Mary's powers were by no means fitted for such a display; her (<font color='blue'><b>Mary</b></font>) voice was
weak, and her (<font color='blue'><b>Mary</b></font>) manner affected. Elizabeth was in agonies. She (<font color='blue'><b>Elizabeth</b></font>) looked at
Jane, to see how she (<font color='blue'><b>Elizabeth</b></font>) bore it; but Jane was very composedly talking to
Bingley. She (<font color='blue'><b>Jane</b></font>) looked at his (<font color='blue'><b>Elizabeth</b></font>) two sisters, and saw them making signs
of derision at each other, and at Darcy, who continued, however,
imperturbably grave. She (<font color='blue'><b>Jane</b></font>) looked at her (<font color='blue'><b>Jane</b></font>) father to entreat his (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>)
interference, lest Mary should be singing all night. He (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) took the hint,
and when Mary had finished her (<font color='blue'><b>Mary</b></font>) second song, said aloud, <div class="bookquote">``That will do
extremely well, child. You have delighted us long enough. Let the other
young ladies have time to exhibit.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Mary/Mary King</b></font>)</div><p/>Mary, though pretending not to hear, was somewhat disconcerted; and
Elizabeth, sorry for her (<font color='blue'><b>Elizabeth</b></font>), and sorry for her (<font color='blue'><b>Elizabeth</b></font>) father's speech, was afraid
her (<font color='blue'><b>Elizabeth</b></font>) anxiety had done no good. Others of the party were now applied to.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``If I,''  (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Collins</b></font>)</div>said Mr. Collins, <div class="bookquote">``were so fortunate as to be able to sing, I
should have great pleasure, I am sure, in obliging the company with an
air; for I consider music as a very innocent diversion, and perfectly
compatible with the profession of a clergyman. I do not mean, however,
to assert that we can be justified in devoting too much of our time
to music, for there are certainly other things to be attended to. The
rector of a parish has much to do. In the first place, he (<font color='blue'><b>rector</b></font>) must make
such an agreement for tithes as may be beneficial to himself and not
offensive to his (<font color='blue'><b>rector</b></font>) patron. He (<font color='blue'><b>rector</b></font>) must write his (<font color='blue'><b>rector</b></font>) own sermons; and the time
that remains will not be too much for his (<font color='blue'><b>rector</b></font>) parish duties, and the care
and improvement of his (<font color='blue'><b>rector</b></font>) dwelling, which he (<font color='blue'><b>rector</b></font>) cannot be excused from making
as comfortable as possible. And I do not think it of light importance
that he (<font color='blue'><b>rector</b></font>) should have attentive and conciliatory manners towards everybody,
especially towards those to whom he (<font color='blue'><b>rector</b></font>) owes his (<font color='blue'><b>rector</b></font>) preferment. I cannot acquit
him (<font color='blue'><b>rector</b></font>) of that duty; nor could I think well of the man who should omit an
occasion of testifying his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) respect towards anybody connected with the
family.''  (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Collins</b></font>)</div>And with a bow to Mr. Darcy, he (<font color='blue'><b>Darcy</b></font>) concluded his (<font color='blue'><b>Darcy</b></font>) speech, which had
been spoken so loud as to be heard by half the room. Many stared--many
smiled; but no one looked more amused than Mr. Bennet himself, while his (<font color='blue'><b>Bennet</b></font>)
wife seriously commended Mr. Collins for having spoken so sensibly,
and observed in a half-whisper to Lady Lucas, that he (<font color='blue'><b>Bennet</b></font>) was a remarkably
clever, good kind of young man.

<p/>To Elizabeth it appeared that, had her (<font color='blue'><b>Elizabeth</b></font>) family made an agreement to
expose themselves as much as they could during the evening, it would
have been impossible for them to play their parts with more spirit or
finer success; and happy did she (<font color='blue'><b>Elizabeth</b></font>) think it for Bingley and her (<font color='blue'><b>Elizabeth</b></font>) sister
that some of the exhibition had escaped his (<font color='blue'><b>Bingley</b></font>) notice, and that his (<font color='blue'><b>Bingley</b></font>)
feelings were not of a sort to be much distressed by the folly which he (<font color='blue'><b>Bingley</b></font>)
must have witnessed. That his (<font color='blue'><b>Bingley</b></font>) two sisters and Mr. Darcy, however, should
have such an opportunity of ridiculing her (<font color='blue'><b>Elizabeth</b></font>) relations, was bad enough,
and she (<font color='blue'><b>Elizabeth</b></font>) could not determine whether the silent contempt of the
gentleman, or the insolent smiles of the ladies, were more intolerable.

<p/>The rest of the evening brought her (<font color='blue'><b>Elizabeth</b></font>) little amusement. She (<font color='blue'><b>Elizabeth</b></font>) was teased by
Mr. Collins, who continued most perseveringly by her (<font color='blue'><b>Elizabeth</b></font>) side, and though
he (<font color='blue'><b>Collins</b></font>) could not prevail on her (<font color='blue'><b>Elizabeth</b></font>) to dance with him (<font color='blue'><b>Collins</b></font>) again, put it out of her (<font color='blue'><b>Elizabeth</b></font>)
power to dance with others. In vain did she (<font color='blue'><b>Elizabeth</b></font>) entreat him (<font color='blue'><b>Collins</b></font>) to stand up with
somebody else, and offer to introduce him (<font color='blue'><b>Collins</b></font>) to any young lady in the room.
He (<font color='blue'><b>Collins</b></font>) assured her (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>), that as to dancing, he (<font color='blue'><b>Collins</b></font>) was perfectly indifferent to it;
that his (<font color='blue'><b>Collins</b></font>) chief object was by delicate attentions to recommend himself to
her (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) and that he (<font color='blue'><b>Collins</b></font>) should therefore make a point of remaining close to her (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>)
the whole evening. There was no arguing upon such a project. She (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) owed
her (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) greatest relief to her (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) friend Miss Lucas, who often joined them, and
good-naturedly engaged Mr. Collins's conversation to herself.

<p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) was at least free from the offense of Mr. Darcy's further notice;
though often standing within a very short distance of her (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>), quite
disengaged, he (<font color='blue'><b>Darcy</b></font>) never came near enough to speak. She (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) felt it to be the
probable consequence of her (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) allusions to Mr. Wickham, and rejoiced in
it.

<p/>The Longbourn party were the last of all the company to depart, and, by
a manoeuvre of Mrs. Bennet, had to wait for their carriage a quarter of
an hour after everybody else was gone, which gave them time to see how
heartily they were wished away by some of the family. Mrs. Hurst and her (<font color='blue'><b>Hurst</b></font>)
sister scarcely opened their mouths, except to complain of fatigue, and
were evidently impatient to have the house to themselves. They repulsed
every attempt of Mrs. Bennet at conversation, and by so doing threw a
languor over the whole party, which was very little relieved by the
long speeches of Mr. Collins, who was complimenting Mr. Bingley and his (<font color='blue'><b>Bingley</b></font>)
sisters on the elegance of their entertainment, and the hospitality and
politeness which had marked their behaviour to their guests. Darcy said
nothing at all. Mr. Bennet, in equal silence, was enjoying the scene.
Mr. Bingley and Jane were standing together, a little detached from the
rest, and talked only to each other. Elizabeth preserved as steady a
silence as either Mrs. Hurst or Miss Bingley; and even Lydia was too
much fatigued to utter more than the occasional exclamation of <div class="bookquote">``Lord,
how tired I am!''  (<font color='red'><b>Lydia/Miss Lydia/Miss Lydia Bennet</b></font>)</div>accompanied by a violent yawn.

<p/>When at length they arose to take leave, Mrs. Bennet was most pressingly
civil in her (<font color='blue'><b>Bennet</b></font>) hope of seeing the whole family soon at Longbourn, and
addressed herself especially to Mr. Bingley, to assure him (<font color='blue'><b>Bingley</b></font>) how happy he (<font color='blue'><b>Bingley</b></font>)
would make them by eating a family dinner with them at any time, without
the ceremony of a formal invitation. Bingley was all grateful pleasure,
and he (<font color='blue'><b>Bingley</b></font>) readily engaged for taking the earliest opportunity of waiting on
her (<font color='blue'><b>Bennet</b></font>), after his (<font color='blue'><b>Bingley</b></font>) return from London, whither he (<font color='blue'><b>Bingley</b></font>) was obliged to go the next
day for a short time.

<p/>Mrs. Bennet was perfectly satisfied, and quitted the house under the
delightful persuasion that, allowing for the necessary preparations of
settlements, new carriages, and wedding clothes, she (<font color='blue'><b>Bennet</b></font>) should undoubtedly
see her (<font color='blue'><b>Bennet</b></font>) daughter settled at Netherfield in the course of three or four
months. Of having another daughter married to Mr. Collins, she (<font color='blue'><b>daughter</b></font>) thought
with equal certainty, and with considerable, though not equal, pleasure.
Elizabeth was the least dear to her (<font color='blue'><b>Elizabeth</b></font>) of all her (<font color='blue'><b>Elizabeth</b></font>) children; and though the
man and the match were quite good enough for _her (<font color='blue'><b>Elizabeth</b></font>)_, the worth of each
was eclipsed by Mr. Bingley and Netherfield.



<p/>Chapter 19


<p/>The next day opened a new scene at Longbourn. Mr. Collins made his (<font color='blue'><b>Collins</b></font>)
declaration in form. Having resolved to do it without loss of time, as
his (<font color='blue'><b>Collins</b></font>) leave of absence extended only to the following Saturday, and having
no feelings of diffidence to make it distressing to himself even at
the moment, he (<font color='blue'><b>Collins</b></font>) set about it in a very orderly manner, with all the
observances, which he (<font color='blue'><b>Collins</b></font>) supposed a regular part of the business. On
finding Mrs. Bennet, Elizabeth, and one of the younger girls together,
soon after breakfast, he (<font color='blue'><b>Collins</b></font>) addressed the mother in these words:

<p/><div class="bookquote">``May I hope, madam, for your interest with your fair daughter Elizabeth,
when I solicit for the honour of a private audience with her (<font color='blue'><b>Elizabeth</b></font>) in the
course of this morning?''

 (<font color='red'><b>the mother</b></font>)</div><p/>Before Elizabeth had time for anything but a blush of surprise, Mrs.
Bennet answered instantly, <div class="bookquote">``Oh dear!--yes--certainly. I am sure Lizzy
will be very happy--I am sure she (<font color='blue'><b>Lizzy</b></font>) can have no objection. Come, Kitty, I
want you up stairs.''  (<font color='red'><b>Mrs. Bennet</b></font>)</div>And, gathering her (<font color='blue'><b>Bennet</b></font>) work together, she (<font color='blue'><b>Bennet</b></font>) was hastening
away, when Elizabeth called out:

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Dear madam, do not go. I beg you will not go. Mr. Collins must excuse
me. He (<font color='blue'><b>Collins</b></font>) can have nothing to say to me that anybody need not hear. I am
going away myself.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Elizabeth/Miss Bennet/Miss Elizabeth</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``No, no, nonsense, Lizzy. I desire you to stay where you are.''  (<font color='red'><b>Elizabeth/Miss Bennet/Miss Elizabeth</b></font>)</div>And upon
Elizabeth's seeming really, with vexed and embarrassed looks, about to
escape, she (<font color='blue'><b>Elizabeth</b></font>) added: <div class="bookquote">``Lizzy, I _insist_ upon your staying and hearing Mr.
Collins.''

 (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div><p/>Elizabeth would not oppose such an injunction--and a moment's
consideration making her (<font color='blue'><b>Elizabeth</b></font>) also sensible that it would be wisest to get it
over as soon and as quietly as possible, she (<font color='blue'><b>Elizabeth</b></font>) sat down again and tried to
conceal, by incessant employment the feelings which were divided between
distress and diversion. Mrs. Bennet and Kitty walked off, and as soon as
they were gone, Mr. Collins began.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Believe me, my dear Miss Elizabeth, that your modesty, so far from
doing you any disservice, rather adds to your other perfections. You
would have been less amiable in my eyes had there _not_ been this little
unwillingness; but allow me to assure you, that I have your respected
mother's permission for this address. You can hardly doubt the
purport of my discourse, however your natural delicacy may lead you to
dissemble; my attentions have been too marked to be mistaken. Almost as
soon as I entered the house, I singled you out as the companion of
my future life. But before I am run away with by my feelings on this
subject, perhaps it would be advisable for me to state my reasons for
marrying--and, moreover, for coming into Hertfordshire with the design
of selecting a wife, as I certainly did.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Collins</b></font>)</div><p/>The idea of Mr. Collins, with all his (<font color='blue'><b>Collins</b></font>) solemn composure, being run away
with by his (<font color='blue'><b>Collins</b></font>) feelings, made Elizabeth so near laughing, that she (<font color='blue'><b>Elizabeth</b></font>) could
not use the short pause he (<font color='blue'><b>Collins</b></font>) allowed in any attempt to stop him (<font color='blue'><b>Collins</b></font>) further,
and he (<font color='blue'><b>Collins</b></font>) continued:

<p/>``My reasons for marrying are, first, that I think it a right thing for
every clergyman in easy circumstances -LRB-like myself-RRB- to set the example
of matrimony in his (<font color='blue'><b>clergyman</b></font>) parish; secondly, that I am convinced that it will
add very greatly to my happiness; and thirdly--which perhaps I ought
to have mentioned earlier, that it is the particular advice and
recommendation of the very noble lady whom I have the honour of calling
patroness. Twice has she (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) condescended to give me her (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) opinion -LRB-unasked
too!-RRB- on this subject; and it was but the very Saturday night before I
left Hunsford--between our pools at quadrille, while Mrs. Jenkinson was
arranging Miss de Bourgh's footstool, that she (<font color='blue'><b>Jenkinson</b></font>) said, ``Mr. Collins, you
must marry. A clergyman like you must marry. Choose properly, choose
a gentlewoman for _my_ sake; and for your _own_, let her (<font color='blue'><b>Jenkinson</b></font>) be an active,
useful sort of person, not brought up high, but able to make a small
income go a good way. This is my advice. Find such a woman as soon as
you can, bring her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) to Hunsford, and I will visit her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>).<div class="bookquote">'' Allow me, by the
way, to observe, my fair cousin, that I do not reckon the notice
and kindness of Lady Catherine de Bourgh as among the least of the
advantages in my power to offer. You will find her (<font color='blue'><b>Bourgh</b></font>) manners beyond
anything I can describe; and your wit and vivacity, I think, must be
acceptable to her (<font color='blue'><b>Bourgh</b></font>), especially when tempered with the silence and
respect which her (<font color='blue'><b>Bourgh</b></font>) rank will inevitably excite. Thus much for my general
intention in favour of matrimony; it remains to be told why my views
were directed towards Longbourn instead of my own neighbourhood, where I
can assure you there are many amiable young women. But the fact is, that
being, as I am, to inherit this estate after the death of your honoured
father -LRB-who, however, may live many years longer-RRB-, I could not satisfy
myself without resolving to choose a wife from among his (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) daughters, that
the loss to them might be as little as possible, when the melancholy
event takes place--which, however, as I have already said, may not
be for several years. This has been my motive, my fair cousin, and
I flatter myself it will not sink me in your esteem. And now nothing
remains for me but to assure you in the most animated language of the
violence of my affection. To fortune I am perfectly indifferent, and
shall make no demand of that nature on your father, since I am well
aware that it could not be complied with; and that one thousand pounds
in the four per cents, which will not be yours till after your mother's
decease, is all that you may ever be entitled to. On that head,
therefore, I shall be uniformly silent; and you may assure yourself that
no ungenerous reproach shall ever pass my lips when we are married.''

 (<font color='red'><b>her</b></font>)</div><p/>It was absolutely necessary to interrupt him (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) now.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``You are too hasty, sir,''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) cried. <div class="bookquote">``You forget that I have made no
answer. Let me do it without further loss of time. Accept my thanks for
the compliment you are paying me. I am very sensible of the honour of
your proposals, but it is impossible for me to do otherwise than to
decline them.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I am not now to learn,''  (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Collins</b></font>)</div>replied Mr. Collins, with a formal wave of the
hand, <div class="bookquote">``that it is usual with young ladies to reject the addresses of the
man whom they secretly mean to accept, when he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) first applies for their
favour; and that sometimes the refusal is repeated a second, or even a
third time. I am therefore by no means discouraged by what you have just
said, and shall hope to lead you to the altar ere long.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Collins</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Upon my word, sir,''  (<font color='red'><b>Elizabeth/Miss Bennet/Miss Elizabeth</b></font>)</div>cried Elizabeth, <div class="bookquote">``your hope is a rather
extraordinary one after my declaration. I do assure you that I am not
one of those young ladies -LRB-if such young ladies there are-RRB- who are so
daring as to risk their happiness on the chance of being asked a second
time. I am perfectly serious in my refusal. You could not make _me_
happy, and I am convinced that I am the last woman in the world who
could make you so. Nay, were your friend Lady Catherine to know me, I
am persuaded she (<font color='blue'><b>Catherine</b></font>) would find me in every respect ill qualified for the
situation.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Elizabeth/Miss Bennet/Miss Elizabeth</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Were it certain that Lady Catherine would think so,''  (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Collins</b></font>)</div>said Mr. Collins
very gravely--<div class="bookquote">``but I cannot imagine that her (<font color='blue'><b>Catherine</b></font>) ladyship would at all
disapprove of you. And you may be certain when I have the honour of
seeing her (<font color='blue'><b>Catherine</b></font>) again, I shall speak in the very highest terms of your
modesty, economy, and other amiable qualification.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Collins</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Indeed, Mr. Collins, all praise of me will be unnecessary. You
must give me leave to judge for myself, and pay me the compliment
of believing what I say. I wish you very happy and very rich, and by
refusing your hand, do all in my power to prevent your being otherwise.
In making me the offer, you must have satisfied the delicacy of your
feelings with regard to my family, and may take possession of Longbourn
estate whenever it falls, without any self-reproach. This matter may
be considered, therefore, as finally settled.''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>And rising as she (<font color='blue'><b>Elizabeth</b></font>)
thus spoke, she (<font color='blue'><b>Elizabeth</b></font>) would have quitted the room, had Mr. Collins not thus
addressed her (<font color='blue'><b>Elizabeth</b></font>):

<p/><div class="bookquote">``When I do myself the honour of speaking to you next on the subject, I
shall hope to receive a more favourable answer than you have now given
me; though I am far from accusing you of cruelty at present, because I
know it to be the established custom of your sex to reject a man on
the first application, and perhaps you have even now said as much to
encourage my suit as would be consistent with the true delicacy of the
female character.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Collins</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Really, Mr. Collins,''  (<font color='red'><b>Elizabeth/Miss Bennet/Miss Elizabeth</b></font>)</div>cried Elizabeth with some warmth, <div class="bookquote">``you puzzle me
exceedingly. If what I have hitherto said can appear to you in the form
of encouragement, I know not how to express my refusal in such a way as
to convince you of its being one.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Elizabeth/Miss Bennet/Miss Elizabeth</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``You must give me leave to flatter myself, my dear cousin, that your
refusal of my addresses is merely words of course. My reasons for
believing it are briefly these: It does not appear to me that my hand is
unworthy of your acceptance, or that the establishment I can offer would
be any other than highly desirable. My situation in life, my connections
with the family of de Bourgh, and my relationship to your own, are
circumstances highly in my favour; and you should take it into further
consideration, that in spite of your manifold attractions, it is by no
means certain that another offer of marriage may ever be made you. Your
portion is unhappily so small that it will in all likelihood undo
the effects of your loveliness and amiable qualifications. As I must
therefore conclude that you are not serious in your rejection of me,
I shall choose to attribute it to your wish of increasing my love by
suspense, according to the usual practice of elegant females.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I do assure you, sir, that I have no pretensions whatever to that kind
of elegance which consists in tormenting a respectable man. I would
rather be paid the compliment of being believed sincere. I thank you
again and again for the honour you have done me in your proposals, but
to accept them is absolutely impossible. My feelings in every respect
forbid it. Can I speak plainer? Do not consider me now as an elegant
female, intending to plague you, but as a rational creature, speaking
the truth from her (<font color='blue'><b>female</b></font>) heart.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``You are uniformly charming!''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>cried he (<font color='blue'><b>Collins</b></font>), with an air of awkward
gallantry; <div class="bookquote">``and I am persuaded that when sanctioned by the express
authority of both your excellent parents, my proposals will not fail of
being acceptable.''

 (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div><p/>To such perseverance in wilful self-deception Elizabeth would make
no reply, and immediately and in silence withdrew; determined, if
he (<font color='blue'><b>Collins</b></font>) persisted in considering her (<font color='blue'><b>Elizabeth</b></font>) repeated refusals as flattering
encouragement, to apply to her (<font color='blue'><b>Elizabeth</b></font>) father, whose negative might be uttered
in such a manner as to be decisive, and whose behaviour at least could
not be mistaken for the affectation and coquetry of an elegant female.



<p/>Chapter 20


<p/>Mr. Collins was not left long to the silent contemplation of his (<font color='blue'><b>Collins</b></font>)
successful love; for Mrs. Bennet, having dawdled about in the vestibule
to watch for the end of the conference, no sooner saw Elizabeth open
the door and with quick step pass her (<font color='blue'><b>Elizabeth</b></font>) towards the staircase, than she (<font color='blue'><b>Elizabeth</b></font>)
entered the breakfast-room, and congratulated both him (<font color='blue'><b>Collins</b></font>) and herself in
warm terms on the happy prospect of their nearer connection. Mr. Collins
received and returned these felicitations with equal pleasure, and then
proceeded to relate the particulars of their interview, with the result
of which he (<font color='blue'><b>Collins</b></font>) trusted he (<font color='blue'><b>Collins</b></font>) had every reason to be satisfied, since the
refusal which his (<font color='blue'><b>Collins</b></font>) cousin had steadfastly given him (<font color='blue'><b>Collins</b></font>) would naturally flow
from her (<font color='blue'><b>Elizabeth</b></font>) bashful modesty and the genuine delicacy of her (<font color='blue'><b>Elizabeth</b></font>) character.

<p/>This information, however, startled Mrs. Bennet; she (<font color='blue'><b>Bennet</b></font>) would have been
glad to be equally satisfied that her (<font color='blue'><b>Bennet</b></font>) daughter had meant to encourage
him (<font color='blue'><b>character</b></font>) by protesting against his (<font color='blue'><b>character</b></font>) proposals, but she (<font color='blue'><b>Bennet</b></font>) dared not believe it,
and could not help saying so.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``But, depend upon it, Mr. Collins,''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Bennet</b></font>) added, <div class="bookquote">``that Lizzy shall be
brought to reason. I will speak to her (<font color='blue'><b>Lizzy</b></font>) about it directly. She (<font color='blue'><b>Lizzy</b></font>) is a very
headstrong, foolish girl, and does not know her (<font color='blue'><b>Lizzy</b></font>) own interest but I will
_make_ her (<font color='blue'><b>Lizzy</b></font>) know it.''

 (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Pardon me for interrupting you, madam,''  (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Collins</b></font>)</div>cried Mr. Collins; <div class="bookquote">``but if
she (<font color='blue'><b>madam</b></font>) is really headstrong and foolish, I know not whether she (<font color='blue'><b>madam</b></font>) would
altogether be a very desirable wife to a man in my situation, who
naturally looks for happiness in the marriage state. If therefore she (<font color='blue'><b>madam</b></font>)
actually persists in rejecting my suit, perhaps it were better not
to force her (<font color='blue'><b>madam</b></font>) into accepting me, because if liable to such defects of
temper, she (<font color='blue'><b>madam</b></font>) could not contribute much to my felicity.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Collins</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Sir, you quite misunderstand me,''  (<font color='red'><b>Mrs. Bennet</b></font>)</div>said Mrs. Bennet, alarmed. <div class="bookquote">``Lizzy is
only headstrong in such matters as these. In everything else she (<font color='blue'><b>Lizzy</b></font>) is as
good-natured a girl as ever lived. I will go directly to Mr. Bennet, and
we shall very soon settle it with her (<font color='blue'><b>Lizzy</b></font>), I am sure.''

 (<font color='red'><b>She</b></font>)</div><p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>Bennet</b></font>) would not give him (<font color='blue'><b>Collins</b></font>) time to reply, but hurrying instantly to her (<font color='blue'><b>Bennet</b></font>)
husband, called out as she (<font color='blue'><b>Bennet</b></font>) entered the library, <div class="bookquote">``Oh! Mr. Bennet, you
are wanted immediately; we are all in an uproar. You must come and make
Lizzy marry Mr. Collins, for she (<font color='blue'><b>Lizzy</b></font>) vows she (<font color='blue'><b>Lizzy</b></font>) will not have him (<font color='blue'><b>Collins</b></font>), and if you
do not make haste he (<font color='blue'><b>Collins</b></font>) will change his (<font color='blue'><b>Collins</b></font>) mind and not have _her (<font color='blue'><b>Lizzy</b></font>)_.''

 (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div><p/>Mr. Bennet raised his (<font color='blue'><b>Bennet</b></font>) eyes from his (<font color='blue'><b>Bennet</b></font>) book as she (<font color='blue'><b>Bennet</b></font>) entered, and fixed them
on her (<font color='blue'><b>Bennet</b></font>) face with a calm unconcern which was not in the least altered by
her (<font color='blue'><b>Bennet</b></font>) communication.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``I have not the pleasure of understanding you,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>said he (<font color='blue'><b>Bennet</b></font>), when she (<font color='blue'><b>Bennet</b></font>) had
finished her (<font color='blue'><b>Bennet</b></font>) speech. <div class="bookquote">``Of what are you talking?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Of Mr. Collins and Lizzy. Lizzy declares she (<font color='blue'><b>Lizzy</b></font>) will not have Mr. Collins,
and Mr. Collins begins to say that he (<font color='blue'><b>Collins</b></font>) will not have Lizzy.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``And what am I to do on the occasion? It seems an hopeless business.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Speak to Lizzy about it yourself. Tell her (<font color='blue'><b>Lizzy</b></font>) that you insist upon her (<font color='blue'><b>Lizzy</b></font>)
marrying him (<font color='blue'><b>Collins</b></font>).''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Let her (<font color='blue'><b>Lizzy</b></font>) be called down. She (<font color='blue'><b>Lizzy</b></font>) shall hear my opinion.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Mrs. Bennet</b></font>)</div><p/>Mrs. Bennet rang the bell, and Miss Elizabeth was summoned to the
library.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Come here, child,''  (<font color='red'><b>father</b></font>)</div>cried her (<font color='blue'><b>Elizabeth</b></font>) father as she (<font color='blue'><b>Elizabeth</b></font>) appeared. <div class="bookquote">``I have sent for
you on an affair of importance. I understand that Mr. Collins has made
you an offer of marriage. Is it true?''  (<font color='red'><b>Elizabeth/Miss Bennet/Miss Elizabeth</b></font>)</div>Elizabeth replied that it was.
<div class="bookquote">``Very well--and this offer of marriage you have refused?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I have, sir.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Very well. We now come to the point. Your mother insists upon your
accepting it. Is it not so, Mrs. Bennet?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Yes, or I will never see her (<font color='blue'><b>Bennet</b></font>) again.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``An unhappy alternative is before you, Elizabeth. From this day you must
be a stranger to one of your parents. Your mother will never see you
again if you do _not_ marry Mr. Collins, and I will never see you again
if you _do_.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Elizabeth/Miss Bennet/Miss Elizabeth</b></font>)</div><p/>Elizabeth could not but smile at such a conclusion of such a beginning,
but Mrs. Bennet, who had persuaded herself that her (<font color='blue'><b>Bennet</b></font>) husband regarded the
affair as she (<font color='blue'><b>Bennet</b></font>) wished, was excessively disappointed.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``What do you mean, Mr. Bennet, in talking this way? You promised me to
_insist_ upon her (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) marrying him (<font color='blue'><b>Bennet</b></font>).''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``My dear,''  (<font color='red'><b>husband</b></font>)</div>replied her (<font color='blue'><b>Bennet</b></font>) husband, <div class="bookquote">``I have two small favours to request.
First, that you will allow me the free use of my understanding on the
present occasion; and secondly, of my room. I shall be glad to have the
library to myself as soon as may be.''

 (<font color='red'><b>husband</b></font>)</div><p/>Not yet, however, in spite of her (<font color='blue'><b>Bennet</b></font>) disappointment in her (<font color='blue'><b>Bennet</b></font>) husband, did
Mrs. Bennet give up the point. She (<font color='blue'><b>Bennet</b></font>) talked to Elizabeth again and again;
coaxed and threatened her (<font color='blue'><b>Elizabeth</b></font>) by turns. She (<font color='blue'><b>Elizabeth</b></font>) endeavoured to secure Jane
in her (<font color='blue'><b>Elizabeth</b></font>) interest; but Jane, with all possible mildness, declined
interfering; and Elizabeth, sometimes with real earnestness, and
sometimes with playful gaiety, replied to her (<font color='blue'><b>Elizabeth</b></font>) attacks. Though her (<font color='blue'><b>Elizabeth</b></font>) manner
varied, however, her (<font color='blue'><b>Elizabeth</b></font>) determination never did.

<p/>Mr. Collins, meanwhile, was meditating in solitude on what had passed.
He (<font color='blue'><b>Collins</b></font>) thought too well of himself to comprehend on what motives his (<font color='blue'><b>Collins</b></font>) cousin
could refuse him (<font color='blue'><b>Collins</b></font>); and though his (<font color='blue'><b>Collins</b></font>) pride was hurt, he (<font color='blue'><b>Collins</b></font>) suffered in no other
way. His (<font color='blue'><b>Collins</b></font>) regard for her (<font color='blue'><b>Elizabeth</b></font>) was quite imaginary; and the possibility of her (<font color='blue'><b>Elizabeth</b></font>)
deserving her (<font color='blue'><b>Elizabeth</b></font>) mother's reproach prevented his (<font color='blue'><b>Collins</b></font>) feeling any regret.

<p/>While the family were in this confusion, Charlotte Lucas came to spend
the day with them. She (<font color='blue'><b>Lucas</b></font>) was met in the vestibule by Lydia, who, flying to
her (<font color='blue'><b>Lucas</b></font>), cried in a half whisper, <div class="bookquote">``I am glad you are come, for there is such
fun here! What do you think has happened this morning? Mr. Collins has
made an offer to Lizzy, and she (<font color='blue'><b>Lizzy</b></font>) will not have him (<font color='blue'><b>Collins</b></font>).''

 (<font color='red'><b>her</b></font>)</div><p/>Charlotte hardly had time to answer, before they were joined by Kitty,
who came to tell the same news; and no sooner had they entered the
breakfast-room, where Mrs. Bennet was alone, than she (<font color='blue'><b>Bennet</b></font>) likewise began on
the subject, calling on Miss Lucas for her (<font color='blue'><b>Lucas</b></font>) compassion, and entreating
her (<font color='blue'><b>Lucas</b></font>) to persuade her (<font color='blue'><b>Lucas</b></font>) friend Lizzy to comply with the wishes of all her (<font color='blue'><b>Lucas</b></font>)
family. <div class="bookquote">``Pray do, my dear Miss Lucas,''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Lucas</b></font>) added in a melancholy tone,
<div class="bookquote">``for nobody is on my side, nobody takes part with me. I am cruelly used,
nobody feels for my poor nerves.''

 (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div><p/>Charlotte's reply was spared by the entrance of Jane and Elizabeth.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Aye, there she (<font color='blue'><b>Lucas</b></font>) comes,''  (<font color='red'><b>Mrs. Bennet</b></font>)</div>continued Mrs. Bennet, <div class="bookquote">``looking as unconcerned
as may be, and caring no more for us than if we were at York, provided
she (<font color='blue'><b>Lucas</b></font>) can have her (<font color='blue'><b>Lucas</b></font>) own way. But I tell you, Miss Lizzy--if you take it
into your head to go on refusing every offer of marriage in this way,
you will never get a husband at all--and I am sure I do not know who is
to maintain you when your father is dead. I shall not be able to keep
you--and so I warn you. I have done with you from this very day. I told
you in the library, you know, that I should never speak to you again,
and you will find me as good as my word. I have no pleasure in talking
to undutiful children. Not that I have much pleasure, indeed, in talking
to anybody. People who suffer as I do from nervous complaints can have
no great inclination for talking. Nobody can tell what I suffer! But it
is always so. Those who do not complain are never pitied.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Mrs. Bennet</b></font>)</div><p/>Her (<font color='blue'><b>Bennet</b></font>) daughters listened in silence to this effusion, sensible that
any attempt to reason with her (<font color='blue'><b>Bennet</b></font>) or soothe her (<font color='blue'><b>Bennet</b></font>) would only increase the
irritation. She (<font color='blue'><b>Bennet</b></font>) talked on, therefore, without interruption from any of
them, till they were joined by Mr. Collins, who entered the room with
an air more stately than usual, and on perceiving whom, she (<font color='blue'><b>Bennet</b></font>) said to
the girls, <div class="bookquote">``Now, I do insist upon it, that you, all of you, hold
your tongues, and let me and Mr. Collins have a little conversation
together.''

 (<font color='red'><b>the girls</b></font>)</div><p/>Elizabeth passed quietly out of the room, Jane and Kitty followed, but
Lydia stood her (<font color='blue'><b>Lydia</b></font>) ground, determined to hear all she (<font color='blue'><b>Lydia</b></font>) could; and Charlotte,
detained first by the civility of Mr. Collins, whose inquiries after
herself and all her (<font color='blue'><b>Charlotte</b></font>) family were very minute, and then by a little
curiosity, satisfied herself with walking to the window and pretending
not to hear. In a doleful voice Mrs. Bennet began the projected
conversation: <div class="bookquote">``Oh! Mr. Collins!''

 (<font color='red'><b>Mrs. Bennet</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``My dear madam,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>replied he (<font color='blue'><b>Collins</b></font>), <div class="bookquote">``let us be for ever silent on this point.
Far be it from me,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Collins</b></font>) presently continued, in a voice that marked his (<font color='blue'><b>Collins</b></font>)
displeasure, <div class="bookquote">``to resent the behaviour of your daughter. Resignation
to inevitable evils is the duty of us all; the peculiar duty of a
young man who has been so fortunate as I have been in early preferment;
and I trust I am resigned. Perhaps not the less so from feeling a doubt
of my positive happiness had my fair cousin honoured me with her (<font color='blue'><b>daughter</b></font>) hand;
for I have often observed that resignation is never so perfect as
when the blessing denied begins to lose somewhat of its value in our
estimation. You will not, I hope, consider me as showing any disrespect
to your family, my dear madam, by thus withdrawing my pretensions to
your daughter's favour, without having paid yourself and Mr. Bennet the
compliment of requesting you to interpose your authority in my
behalf. My conduct may, I fear, be objectionable in having accepted my
dismission from your daughter's lips instead of your own. But we are all
liable to error. I have certainly meant well through the whole affair.
My object has been to secure an amiable companion for myself, with due
consideration for the advantage of all your family, and if my _manner_
has been at all reprehensible, I here beg leave to apologise.''



 (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div><p/>Chapter 21


<p/>The discussion of Mr. Collins's offer was now nearly at an end, and
Elizabeth had only to suffer from the uncomfortable feelings necessarily
attending it, and occasionally from some peevish allusions of her (<font color='blue'><b>Elizabeth</b></font>)
mother. As for the gentleman himself, _his (<font color='blue'><b>gentleman</b></font>)_ feelings were chiefly
expressed, not by embarrassment or dejection, or by trying to avoid her (<font color='blue'><b>Elizabeth</b></font>),
but by stiffness of manner and resentful silence. He (<font color='blue'><b>gentleman</b></font>) scarcely ever spoke
to her (<font color='blue'><b>Elizabeth</b></font>), and the assiduous attentions which he (<font color='blue'><b>gentleman</b></font>) had been so sensible of
himself were transferred for the rest of the day to Miss Lucas, whose
civility in listening to him (<font color='blue'><b>gentleman</b></font>) was a seasonable relief to them all, and
especially to her (<font color='blue'><b>Lucas</b></font>) friend.

<p/>The morrow produced no abatement of Mrs. Bennet's ill-humour or ill
health. Mr. Collins was also in the same state of angry pride. Elizabeth
had hoped that his (<font color='blue'><b>Collins</b></font>) resentment might shorten his (<font color='blue'><b>Collins</b></font>) visit, but his (<font color='blue'><b>Collins</b></font>) plan did
not appear in the least affected by it. He (<font color='blue'><b>Collins</b></font>) was always to have gone on
Saturday, and to Saturday he (<font color='blue'><b>Collins</b></font>) meant to stay.

<p/>After breakfast, the girls walked to Meryton to inquire if Mr. Wickham
were returned, and to lament over his (<font color='blue'><b>Wickham</b></font>) absence from the Netherfield ball.
He (<font color='blue'><b>Wickham</b></font>) joined them on their entering the town, and attended them to their
aunt's where his (<font color='blue'><b>Wickham</b></font>) regret and vexation, and the concern of everybody, was
well talked over. To Elizabeth, however, he (<font color='blue'><b>Wickham</b></font>) voluntarily acknowledged
that the necessity of his (<font color='blue'><b>Wickham</b></font>) absence _had_ been self-imposed.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``I found,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>said he (<font color='blue'><b>Wickham</b></font>), <div class="bookquote">``as the time drew near that I had better not meet
Mr. Darcy; that to be in the same room, the same party with him (<font color='blue'><b>Darcy</b></font>) for so
many hours together, might be more than I could bear, and that scenes
might arise unpleasant to more than myself.''

 (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div><p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>Elizabeth</b></font>) highly approved his (<font color='blue'><b>Wickham</b></font>) forbearance, and they had leisure for a full
discussion of it, and for all the commendation which they civilly
bestowed on each other, as Wickham and another officer walked back with
them to Longbourn, and during the walk he (<font color='blue'><b>Wickham</b></font>) particularly attended to
her (<font color='blue'><b>Elizabeth</b></font>). His (<font color='blue'><b>Wickham</b></font>) accompanying them was a double advantage; she (<font color='blue'><b>Elizabeth</b></font>) felt all the
compliment it offered to herself, and it was most acceptable as an
occasion of introducing him (<font color='blue'><b>Wickham</b></font>) to her (<font color='blue'><b>Elizabeth</b></font>) father and mother.

<p/>Soon after their return, a letter was delivered to Miss Bennet; it came
from Netherfield. The envelope contained a sheet of elegant, little,
hot-pressed paper, well covered with a lady's fair, flowing hand; and
Elizabeth saw her (<font color='blue'><b>Elizabeth</b></font>) sister's countenance change as she (<font color='blue'><b>Elizabeth</b></font>) read it, and saw
her (<font color='blue'><b>Elizabeth</b></font>) dwelling intently on some particular passages. Jane recollected
herself soon, and putting the letter away, tried to join with her (<font color='blue'><b>Jane</b></font>) usual
cheerfulness in the general conversation; but Elizabeth felt an anxiety
on the subject which drew off her (<font color='blue'><b>Elizabeth</b></font>) attention even from Wickham; and no
sooner had he (<font color='blue'><b>Wickham</b></font>) and his (<font color='blue'><b>Wickham</b></font>) companion taken leave, than a glance from Jane
invited her (<font color='blue'><b>Jane</b></font>) to follow her (<font color='blue'><b>Jane</b></font>) up stairs. When they had gained their own room,
Jane, taking out the letter, said:

<p/><div class="bookquote">``This is from Caroline Bingley; what it contains has surprised me a good
deal. The whole party have left Netherfield by this time, and are on
their way to town--and without any intention of coming back again. You
shall hear what she (<font color='blue'><b>Bingley</b></font>) says.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Jane</b></font>)</div><p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>Jane</b></font>) then read the first sentence aloud, which comprised the information
of their having just resolved to follow their brother to town directly,
and of their meaning to dine in Grosvenor Street, where Mr. Hurst had a
house. The next was in these words: <div class="bookquote">``I do not pretend to regret anything
I shall leave in Hertfordshire, except your society, my dearest friend;
but we will hope, at some future period, to enjoy many returns of that
delightful intercourse we have known, and in the meanwhile may
lessen the pain of separation by a very frequent and most unreserved
correspondence. I depend on you for that.''  (<font color='red'><b>Elizabeth/Miss Bennet/Miss Elizabeth</b></font>)</div>To these highflown
expressions Elizabeth listened with all the insensibility of distrust;
and though the suddenness of their removal surprised her (<font color='blue'><b>Elizabeth</b></font>), she (<font color='blue'><b>Elizabeth</b></font>) saw
nothing in it really to lament; it was not to be supposed that their
absence from Netherfield would prevent Mr. Bingley's being there; and as
to the loss of their society, she (<font color='blue'><b>Elizabeth</b></font>) was persuaded that Jane must cease to
regard it, in the enjoyment of his (<font color='blue'><b>Bingley</b></font>).

<p/><div class="bookquote">``It is unlucky,''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>said she (<font color='blue'><b>Jane</b></font>), after a short pause, <div class="bookquote">``that you should not be
able to see your friends before they leave the country. But may we not
hope that the period of future happiness to which Miss Bingley looks
forward may arrive earlier than she (<font color='blue'><b>Bingley</b></font>) is aware, and that the delightful
intercourse you have known as friends will be renewed with yet greater
satisfaction as sisters? Mr. Bingley will not be detained in London by
them.''

 (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Caroline decidedly says that none of the party will return into
Hertfordshire this winter. I will read it to you:''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``When my brother left us yesterday, he (<font color='blue'><b>brother</b></font>) imagined that the business which
took him (<font color='blue'><b>brother</b></font>) to London might be concluded in three or four days; but as we
are certain it cannot be so, and at the same time convinced that when
Charles gets to town he (<font color='blue'><b>Charles</b></font>) will be in no hurry to leave it again, we have
determined on following him (<font color='blue'><b>Charles</b></font>) thither, that he (<font color='blue'><b>Charles</b></font>) may not be obliged to spend
his (<font color='blue'><b>Charles</b></font>) vacant hours in a comfortless hotel. Many of my acquaintances are
already there for the winter; I wish that I could hear that you, my
dearest friend, had any intention of making one of the crowd--but of
that I despair. I sincerely hope your Christmas in Hertfordshire may
abound in the gaieties which that season generally brings, and that your
beaux will be so numerous as to prevent your feeling the loss of the
three of whom we shall deprive you.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``It is evident by this,''  (<font color='red'><b>Jane</b></font>)</div>added Jane, <div class="bookquote">``that he (<font color='blue'><b>friend</b></font>) comes back no more this
winter.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Jane</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``It is only evident that Miss Bingley does not mean that he (<font color='blue'><b>friend</b></font>) _should_.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Why will you think so? It must be his (<font color='blue'><b>friend</b></font>) own doing. He (<font color='blue'><b>friend</b></font>) is his (<font color='blue'><b>friend</b></font>) own
master. But you do not know _all_. I _will_ read you the passage which
particularly hurts me. I will have no reserves from _you_.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Mr. Darcy is impatient to see his (<font color='blue'><b>Darcy</b></font>) sister; and, to confess the truth,
_we_ are scarcely less eager to meet her (<font color='blue'><b>sister</b></font>) again. I really do not think
Georgiana Darcy has her (<font color='blue'><b>Georgiana</b></font>) equal for beauty, elegance, and accomplishments;
and the affection she (<font color='blue'><b>Georgiana</b></font>) inspires in Louisa and myself is heightened into
something still more interesting, from the hope we dare entertain of
her (<font color='blue'><b>Georgiana</b></font>) being hereafter our sister. I do not know whether I ever before
mentioned to you my feelings on this subject; but I will not leave the
country without confiding them, and I trust you will not esteem them
unreasonable. My brother admires her (<font color='blue'><b>Georgiana</b></font>) greatly already; he (<font color='blue'><b>brother</b></font>) will have
frequent opportunity now of seeing her (<font color='blue'><b>Georgiana</b></font>) on the most intimate footing;
her (<font color='blue'><b>Georgiana</b></font>) relations all wish the connection as much as his (<font color='blue'><b>brother</b></font>) own; and a sister's
partiality is not misleading me, I think, when I call Charles most
capable of engaging any woman's heart. With all these circumstances to
favour an attachment, and nothing to prevent it, am I wrong, my dearest
Jane, in indulging the hope of an event which will secure the happiness
of so many?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``What do you think of _this_ sentence, my dear Lizzy?''  (<font color='red'><b>Jane</b></font>)</div>said Jane as she (<font color='blue'><b>Jane</b></font>)
finished it. <div class="bookquote">``Is it not clear enough? Does it not expressly declare that
Caroline neither expects nor wishes me to be her (<font color='blue'><b>Caroline</b></font>) sister; that she (<font color='blue'><b>Caroline</b></font>) is
perfectly convinced of her (<font color='blue'><b>Caroline</b></font>) brother's indifference; and that if she (<font color='blue'><b>Caroline</b></font>)
suspects the nature of my feelings for him (<font color='blue'><b>brother</b></font>), she (<font color='blue'><b>Caroline</b></font>) means -LRB-most kindly!-RRB- to
put me on my guard? Can there be any other opinion on the subject?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Yes, there can; for mine is totally different. Will you hear it?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Most willingly.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``You shall have it in a few words. Miss Bingley sees that her (<font color='blue'><b>Bingley</b></font>) brother is
in love with you, and wants him (<font color='blue'><b>brother</b></font>) to marry Miss Darcy. She (<font color='blue'><b>Darcy</b></font>) follows him (<font color='blue'><b>brother</b></font>)
to town in hope of keeping him (<font color='blue'><b>brother</b></font>) there, and tries to persuade you that he (<font color='blue'><b>brother</b></font>)
does not care about you.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Jane</b></font>)</div><p/>Jane shook her (<font color='blue'><b>Jane</b></font>) head.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Indeed, Jane, you ought to believe me. No one who has ever seen you
together can doubt his (<font color='blue'><b>brother</b></font>) affection. Miss Bingley, I am sure, cannot. She (<font color='blue'><b>Bingley</b></font>)
is not such a simpleton. Could she (<font color='blue'><b>Bingley</b></font>) have seen half as much love in Mr.
Darcy for herself, she (<font color='blue'><b>Bingley</b></font>) would have ordered her (<font color='blue'><b>Bingley</b></font>) wedding clothes. But the
case is this: We are not rich enough or grand enough for them; and she (<font color='blue'><b>Bingley</b></font>)
is the more anxious to get Miss Darcy for her (<font color='blue'><b>Darcy</b></font>) brother, from the notion
that when there has been _one_ intermarriage, she (<font color='blue'><b>Darcy</b></font>) may have less trouble
in achieving a second; in which there is certainly some ingenuity, and
I dare say it would succeed, if Miss de Bourgh were out of the way. But,
my dearest Jane, you cannot seriously imagine that because Miss Bingley
tells you her (<font color='blue'><b>Bingley</b></font>) brother greatly admires Miss Darcy, he (<font color='blue'><b>brother</b></font>) is in the smallest
degree less sensible of _your_ merit than when he (<font color='blue'><b>brother</b></font>) took leave of you on
Tuesday, or that it will be in her (<font color='blue'><b>Darcy</b></font>) power to persuade him (<font color='blue'><b>brother</b></font>) that, instead
of being in love with you, he (<font color='blue'><b>brother</b></font>) is very much in love with her (<font color='blue'><b>Darcy</b></font>) friend.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``If we thought alike of Miss Bingley,''  (<font color='red'><b>Jane</b></font>)</div>replied Jane, <div class="bookquote">``your
representation of all this might make me quite easy. But I know the
foundation is unjust. Caroline is incapable of wilfully deceiving
anyone; and all that I can hope in this case is that she (<font color='blue'><b>Caroline</b></font>) is deceiving
herself.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Jane</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``That is right. You could not have started a more happy idea, since you
will not take comfort in mine. Believe her (<font color='blue'><b>Caroline</b></font>) to be deceived, by all means.
You have now done your duty by her (<font color='blue'><b>Caroline</b></font>), and must fret no longer.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``But, my dear sister, can I be happy, even supposing the best, in
accepting a man whose sisters and friends are all wishing him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) to marry
elsewhere?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``You must decide for yourself,''  (<font color='red'><b>Elizabeth/Miss Bennet/Miss Elizabeth</b></font>)</div>said Elizabeth; <div class="bookquote">``and if, upon mature
deliberation, you find that the misery of disobliging his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) two sisters is
more than equivalent to the happiness of being his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) wife, I advise you by
all means to refuse him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>).''

 (<font color='red'><b>Elizabeth/Miss Bennet/Miss Elizabeth</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``How can you talk so?''  (<font color='red'><b>Jane</b></font>)</div>said Jane, faintly smiling. <div class="bookquote">``You must know that
though I should be exceedingly grieved at their disapprobation, I could
not hesitate.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I did not think you would; and that being the case, I cannot consider
your situation with much compassion.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``But if he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) returns no more this winter, my choice will never be
required. A thousand things may arise in six months!''

 (<font color='red'><b>Elizabeth/Miss Bennet/Miss Elizabeth</b></font>)</div><p/>The idea of his (<font color='blue'><b>Bingley</b></font>) returning no more Elizabeth treated with the utmost
contempt. It appeared to her (<font color='blue'><b>Jane</b></font>) merely the suggestion of Caroline's
interested wishes, and she (<font color='blue'><b>Jane</b></font>) could not for a moment suppose that those
wishes, however openly or artfully spoken, could influence a young man
so totally independent of everyone.

<p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>Jane</b></font>) represented to her (<font color='blue'><b>Jane</b></font>) sister as forcibly as possible what she (<font color='blue'><b>Jane</b></font>) felt
on the subject, and had soon the pleasure of seeing its happy effect.
Jane's temper was not desponding, and she (<font color='blue'><b>Jane</b></font>) was gradually led to hope,
though the diffidence of affection sometimes overcame the hope, that
Bingley would return to Netherfield and answer every wish of her (<font color='blue'><b>Jane</b></font>) heart.

<p/>They agreed that Mrs. Bennet should only hear of the departure of the
family, without being alarmed on the score of the gentleman's conduct;
but even this partial communication gave her (<font color='blue'><b>Bennet</b></font>) a great deal of concern,
and she (<font color='blue'><b>Bennet</b></font>) bewailed it as exceedingly unlucky that the ladies should happen
to go away just as they were all getting so intimate together. After
lamenting it, however, at some length, she (<font color='blue'><b>Bennet</b></font>) had the consolation that Mr.
Bingley would be soon down again and soon dining at Longbourn, and the
conclusion of all was the comfortable declaration, that though he (<font color='blue'><b>Bingley</b></font>) had
been invited only to a family dinner, she (<font color='blue'><b>Bennet</b></font>) would take care to have two
full courses.



<p/>Chapter 22


<p/>The Bennets were engaged to dine with the Lucases and again during the
chief of the day was Miss Lucas so kind as to listen to Mr. Collins.
Elizabeth took an opportunity of thanking her (<font color='blue'><b>Elizabeth</b></font>). <div class="bookquote">``It keeps him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) in good
humour,''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>said she (<font color='blue'><b>Elizabeth</b></font>), <div class="bookquote">``and I am more obliged to you than I can express.''
 (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>Charlotte assured her (<font color='blue'><b>Charlotte</b></font>) friend of her (<font color='blue'><b>Charlotte</b></font>) satisfaction in being useful, and
that it amply repaid her (<font color='blue'><b>Charlotte</b></font>) for the little sacrifice of her (<font color='blue'><b>Charlotte</b></font>) time. This was
very amiable, but Charlotte's kindness extended farther than Elizabeth
had any conception of; its object was nothing else than to secure her (<font color='blue'><b>Elizabeth</b></font>)
from any return of Mr. Collins's addresses, by engaging them towards
herself. Such was Miss Lucas's scheme; and appearances were so
favourable, that when they parted at night, she (<font color='blue'><b>Lucas</b></font>) would have felt almost
secure of success if he (<font color='blue'><b>Collins</b></font>) had not been to leave Hertfordshire so very
soon. But here she (<font color='blue'><b>Lucas</b></font>) did injustice to the fire and independence of his (<font color='blue'><b>Collins</b></font>)
character, for it led him (<font color='blue'><b>Collins</b></font>) to escape out of Longbourn House the next
morning with admirable slyness, and hasten to Lucas Lodge to throw
himself at her (<font color='blue'><b>Lucas</b></font>) feet. He (<font color='blue'><b>Lodge</b></font>) was anxious to avoid the notice of his (<font color='blue'><b>Lodge</b></font>) cousins,
from a conviction that if they saw him (<font color='blue'><b>Lodge</b></font>) depart, they could not fail to
conjecture his (<font color='blue'><b>Lodge</b></font>) design, and he (<font color='blue'><b>Lodge</b></font>) was not willing to have the attempt known
till its success might be known likewise; for though feeling almost
secure, and with reason, for Charlotte had been tolerably encouraging,
he (<font color='blue'><b>Lodge</b></font>) was comparatively diffident since the adventure of Wednesday.
His (<font color='blue'><b>Lodge</b></font>) reception, however, was of the most flattering kind. Miss Lucas
perceived him (<font color='blue'><b>Lodge</b></font>) from an upper window as he (<font color='blue'><b>Lodge</b></font>) walked towards the house, and
instantly set out to meet him (<font color='blue'><b>Lodge</b></font>) accidentally in the lane. But little had
she (<font color='blue'><b>Lucas</b></font>) dared to hope that so much love and eloquence awaited her (<font color='blue'><b>Lucas</b></font>) there.

<p/>In as short a time as Mr. Collins's long speeches would allow,
everything was settled between them to the satisfaction of both; and as
they entered the house he (<font color='blue'><b>Collins</b></font>) earnestly entreated her (<font color='blue'><b>Lucas</b></font>) to name the day that
was to make him (<font color='blue'><b>Collins</b></font>) the happiest of men; and though such a solicitation must
be waived for the present, the lady felt no inclination to trifle with
his (<font color='blue'><b>Collins</b></font>) happiness. The stupidity with which he (<font color='blue'><b>Collins</b></font>) was favoured by nature must
guard his (<font color='blue'><b>Collins</b></font>) courtship from any charm that could make a woman wish for its
continuance; and Miss Lucas, who accepted him (<font color='blue'><b>Collins</b></font>) solely from the pure
and disinterested desire of an establishment, cared not how soon that
establishment were gained.

<p/>Sir William and Lady Lucas were speedily applied to for their consent;
and it was bestowed with a most joyful alacrity. Mr. Collins's present
circumstances made it a most eligible match for their daughter, to whom
they could give little fortune; and his (<font color='blue'><b>Collins</b></font>) prospects of future wealth were
exceedingly fair. Lady Lucas began directly to calculate, with more
interest than the matter had ever excited before, how many years longer
Mr. Bennet was likely to live; and Sir William gave it as his (<font color='blue'><b>William</b></font>) decided
opinion, that whenever Mr. Collins should be in possession of the
Longbourn estate, it would be highly expedient that both he (<font color='blue'><b>Collins</b></font>) and his (<font color='blue'><b>Collins</b></font>) wife
should make their appearance at St. James's. The whole family, in short,
were properly overjoyed on the occasion. The younger girls formed hopes
of _coming out_ a year or two sooner than they might otherwise have
done; and the boys were relieved from their apprehension of Charlotte's
dying an old maid. Charlotte herself was tolerably composed. She (<font color='blue'><b>Charlotte</b></font>) had
gained her (<font color='blue'><b>Charlotte</b></font>) point, and had time to consider of it. Her (<font color='blue'><b>Charlotte</b></font>) reflections were
in general satisfactory. Mr. Collins, to be sure, was neither sensible
nor agreeable; his (<font color='blue'><b>Collins</b></font>) society was irksome, and his (<font color='blue'><b>Collins</b></font>) attachment to her (<font color='blue'><b>Charlotte</b></font>) must
be imaginary. But still he (<font color='blue'><b>Collins</b></font>) would be her (<font color='blue'><b>Charlotte</b></font>) husband. Without thinking highly
either of men or matrimony, marriage had always been her (<font color='blue'><b>Charlotte</b></font>) object; it was
the only provision for well-educated young women of small fortune,
and however uncertain of giving happiness, must be their pleasantest
preservative from want. This preservative she (<font color='blue'><b>Charlotte</b></font>) had now obtained; and at
the age of twenty-seven, without having ever been handsome, she (<font color='blue'><b>Charlotte</b></font>) felt all
the good luck of it. The least agreeable circumstance in the business
was the surprise it must occasion to Elizabeth Bennet, whose friendship
she (<font color='blue'><b>Bennet</b></font>) valued beyond that of any other person. Elizabeth would wonder,
and probably would blame her (<font color='blue'><b>Elizabeth</b></font>); and though her (<font color='blue'><b>Elizabeth</b></font>) resolution was not to be
shaken, her (<font color='blue'><b>Elizabeth</b></font>) feelings must be hurt by such a disapprobation. She (<font color='blue'><b>Elizabeth</b></font>) resolved
to give her (<font color='blue'><b>Elizabeth</b></font>) the information herself, and therefore charged Mr. Collins,
when he (<font color='blue'><b>Collins</b></font>) returned to Longbourn to dinner, to drop no hint of what had
passed before any of the family. A promise of secrecy was of course very
dutifully given, but it could not be kept without difficulty; for the
curiosity excited by his (<font color='blue'><b>Collins</b></font>) long absence burst forth in such very direct
questions on his (<font color='blue'><b>Collins</b></font>) return as required some ingenuity to evade, and he (<font color='blue'><b>Collins</b></font>) was
at the same time exercising great self-denial, for he (<font color='blue'><b>Collins</b></font>) was longing to
publish his (<font color='blue'><b>Collins</b></font>) prosperous love.

<p/>As he (<font color='blue'><b>Collins</b></font>) was to begin his (<font color='blue'><b>Collins</b></font>) journey too early on the morrow to see any of the
family, the ceremony of leave-taking was performed when the ladies moved
for the night; and Mrs. Bennet, with great politeness and cordiality,
said how happy they should be to see him (<font color='blue'><b>Collins</b></font>) at Longbourn again, whenever
his (<font color='blue'><b>Collins</b></font>) engagements might allow him (<font color='blue'><b>Collins</b></font>) to visit them.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``My dear madam,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Collins</b></font>) replied, <div class="bookquote">``this invitation is particularly
gratifying, because it is what I have been hoping to receive; and
you may be very certain that I shall avail myself of it as soon as
possible.''

 (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div><p/>They were all astonished; and Mr. Bennet, who could by no means wish for
so speedy a return, immediately said:

<p/><div class="bookquote">``But is there not danger of Lady Catherine's disapprobation here, my
good sir? You had better neglect your relations than run the risk of
offending your patroness.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Bennet</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``My dear sir,''  (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Collins</b></font>)</div>replied Mr. Collins, <div class="bookquote">``I am particularly obliged to you
for this friendly caution, and you may depend upon my not taking so
material a step without her (<font color='blue'><b>Catherine</b></font>) ladyship's concurrence.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Collins</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``You cannot be too much upon your guard. Risk anything rather than her (<font color='blue'><b>Catherine</b></font>)
displeasure; and if you find it likely to be raised by your coming to us
again, which I should think exceedingly probable, stay quietly at home,
and be satisfied that _we_ shall take no offence.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Believe me, my dear sir, my gratitude is warmly excited by such
affectionate attention; and depend upon it, you will speedily receive
from me a letter of thanks for this, and for every other mark of your
regard during my stay in Hertfordshire. As for my fair cousins, though
my absence may not be long enough to render it necessary, I shall now
take the liberty of wishing them health and happiness, not excepting my
cousin Elizabeth.''

 (<font color='red'><b>the ladies</b></font>)</div><p/>With proper civilities the ladies then withdrew; all of them equally
surprised that he (<font color='blue'><b>Collins</b></font>) meditated a quick return. Mrs. Bennet wished to
understand by it that he (<font color='blue'><b>Collins</b></font>) thought of paying his (<font color='blue'><b>Collins</b></font>) addresses to one of her (<font color='blue'><b>Bennet</b></font>)
younger girls, and Mary might have been prevailed on to accept him (<font color='blue'><b>Collins</b></font>).
She (<font color='blue'><b>Mary</b></font>) rated his (<font color='blue'><b>Collins</b></font>) abilities much higher than any of the others; there was
a solidity in his (<font color='blue'><b>Collins</b></font>) reflections which often struck her (<font color='blue'><b>Mary</b></font>), and though by no
means so clever as herself, she (<font color='blue'><b>Mary</b></font>) thought that if encouraged to read
and improve himself by such an example as hers, he (<font color='blue'><b>Collins</b></font>) might become a very
agreeable companion. But on the following morning, every hope of this
kind was done away. Miss Lucas called soon after breakfast, and in a
private conference with Elizabeth related the event of the day before.

<p/>The possibility of Mr. Collins's fancying himself in love with her (<font color='blue'><b>Elizabeth</b></font>)
friend had once occurred to Elizabeth within the last day or two; but
that Charlotte could encourage him (<font color='blue'><b>friend</b></font>) seemed almost as far from
possibility as she (<font color='blue'><b>Charlotte</b></font>) could encourage him (<font color='blue'><b>friend</b></font>) herself, and her (<font color='blue'><b>Charlotte</b></font>) astonishment was
consequently so great as to overcome at first the bounds of decorum, and
she (<font color='blue'><b>Charlotte</b></font>) could not help crying out:

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Engaged to Mr. Collins! My dear Charlotte--impossible!''

 (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div><p/>The steady countenance which Miss Lucas had commanded in telling her (<font color='blue'><b>Lucas</b></font>)
story, gave way to a momentary confusion here on receiving so direct a
reproach; though, as it was no more than she (<font color='blue'><b>Lucas</b></font>) expected, she (<font color='blue'><b>Lucas</b></font>) soon regained
her (<font color='blue'><b>Lucas</b></font>) composure, and calmly replied:

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Why should you be surprised, my dear Eliza? Do you think it incredible
that Mr. Collins should be able to procure any woman's good opinion,
because he (<font color='blue'><b>Collins</b></font>) was not so happy as to succeed with you?''

 (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div><p/>But Elizabeth had now recollected herself, and making a strong effort
for it, was able to assure with tolerable firmness that the prospect of
their relationship was highly grateful to her (<font color='blue'><b>Elizabeth</b></font>), and that she (<font color='blue'><b>Elizabeth</b></font>) wished her (<font color='blue'><b>Elizabeth</b></font>)
all imaginable happiness.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``I see what you are feeling,''  (<font color='red'><b>Charlotte</b></font>)</div>replied Charlotte. <div class="bookquote">``You must be surprised,
very much surprised--so lately as Mr. Collins was wishing to marry
you. But when you have had time to think it over, I hope you will be
satisfied with what I have done. I am not romantic, you know; I never
was. I ask only a comfortable home; and considering Mr. Collins's
character, connection, and situation in life, I am convinced that my
chance of happiness with him (<font color='blue'><b>Collins</b></font>) is as fair as most people can boast on
entering the marriage state.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Elizabeth/Miss Bennet/Miss Elizabeth</b></font>)</div><p/>Elizabeth quietly answered <div class="bookquote">``Undoubtedly;''  (<font color='red'><b>Elizabeth/Miss Bennet/Miss Elizabeth</b></font>)</div>and after an awkward pause,
they returned to the rest of the family. Charlotte did not stay much
longer, and Elizabeth was then left to reflect on what she (<font color='blue'><b>Elizabeth</b></font>) had heard.
It was a long time before she (<font color='blue'><b>Elizabeth</b></font>) became at all reconciled to the idea of so
unsuitable a match. The strangeness of Mr. Collins's making two offers
of marriage within three days was nothing in comparison of his (<font color='blue'><b>Collins</b></font>) being now
accepted. She (<font color='blue'><b>Elizabeth</b></font>) had always felt that Charlotte's opinion of matrimony was
not exactly like her (<font color='blue'><b>Charlotte</b></font>) own, but she (<font color='blue'><b>Charlotte</b></font>) had not supposed it to be possible
that, when called into action, she (<font color='blue'><b>Charlotte</b></font>) would have sacrificed every better
feeling to worldly advantage. Charlotte the wife of Mr. Collins was a
most humiliating picture! And to the pang of a friend disgracing herself
and sunk in her (<font color='blue'><b>Charlotte</b></font>) esteem, was added the distressing conviction that it
was impossible for that friend to be tolerably happy in the lot she (<font color='blue'><b>Charlotte</b></font>) had
chosen.



<p/>Chapter 23


<p/>Elizabeth was sitting with her (<font color='blue'><b>Elizabeth</b></font>) mother and sisters, reflecting on what
she (<font color='blue'><b>Elizabeth</b></font>) had heard, and doubting whether she (<font color='blue'><b>Elizabeth</b></font>) was authorised to mention
it, when Sir William Lucas himself appeared, sent by his (<font color='blue'><b>Lucas</b></font>) daughter, to
announce her (<font color='blue'><b>daughter</b></font>) engagement to the family. With many compliments to them,
and much self-gratulation on the prospect of a connection between the
houses, he (<font color='blue'><b>Lucas</b></font>) unfolded the matter--to an audience not merely wondering, but
incredulous; for Mrs. Bennet, with more perseverance than politeness,
protested he (<font color='blue'><b>Lucas</b></font>) must be entirely mistaken; and Lydia, always unguarded and
often uncivil, boisterously exclaimed:

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Good Lord! Sir William, how can you tell such a story? Do not you know
that Mr. Collins wants to marry Lizzy?''

 (<font color='red'><b>Lydia/Miss Lydia/Miss Lydia Bennet</b></font>)</div><p/>Nothing less than the complaisance of a courtier could have borne
without anger such treatment; but Sir William's good breeding carried
him (<font color='blue'><b>William</b></font>) through it all; and though he (<font color='blue'><b>William</b></font>) begged leave to be positive as to the
truth of his (<font color='blue'><b>William</b></font>) information, he (<font color='blue'><b>William</b></font>) listened to all their impertinence with the
most forbearing courtesy.

<p/>Elizabeth, feeling it incumbent on her (<font color='blue'><b>Elizabeth</b></font>) to relieve him (<font color='blue'><b>William</b></font>) from so unpleasant
a situation, now put herself forward to confirm his (<font color='blue'><b>William</b></font>) account, by
mentioning her (<font color='blue'><b>Elizabeth</b></font>) prior knowledge of it from Charlotte herself; and
endeavoured to put a stop to the exclamations of her (<font color='blue'><b>Charlotte</b></font>) mother and sisters
by the earnestness of her (<font color='blue'><b>Charlotte</b></font>) congratulations to Sir William, in which she (<font color='blue'><b>Charlotte</b></font>)
was readily joined by Jane, and by making a variety of remarks on the
happiness that might be expected from the match, the excellent character
of Mr. Collins, and the convenient distance of Hunsford from London.

<p/>Mrs. Bennet was in fact too much overpowered to say a great deal while
Sir William remained; but no sooner had he (<font color='blue'><b>William</b></font>) left them than her (<font color='blue'><b>Bennet</b></font>) feelings
found a rapid vent. In the first place, she (<font color='blue'><b>Bennet</b></font>) persisted in disbelieving
the whole of the matter; secondly, she (<font color='blue'><b>Bennet</b></font>) was very sure that Mr. Collins
had been taken in; thirdly, she (<font color='blue'><b>Bennet</b></font>) trusted that they would never be
happy together; and fourthly, that the match might be broken off. Two
inferences, however, were plainly deduced from the whole: one, that
Elizabeth was the real cause of the mischief; and the other that she (<font color='blue'><b>Elizabeth</b></font>)
herself had been barbarously misused by them all; and on these two
points she (<font color='blue'><b>Elizabeth</b></font>) principally dwelt during the rest of the day. Nothing could
console and nothing could appease her (<font color='blue'><b>Elizabeth</b></font>). Nor did that day wear out her (<font color='blue'><b>Elizabeth</b></font>)
resentment. A week elapsed before she (<font color='blue'><b>Elizabeth</b></font>) could see Elizabeth without
scolding her (<font color='blue'><b>Elizabeth</b></font>), a month passed away before she (<font color='blue'><b>Elizabeth</b></font>) could speak to Sir William
or Lady Lucas without being rude, and many months were gone before she (<font color='blue'><b>Lucas</b></font>)
could at all forgive their daughter.

<p/>Mr. Bennet's emotions were much more tranquil on the occasion, and such
as he (<font color='blue'><b>Bennet</b></font>) did experience he (<font color='blue'><b>Bennet</b></font>) pronounced to be of a most agreeable sort; for
it gratified him (<font color='blue'><b>Bennet</b></font>), he (<font color='blue'><b>Bennet</b></font>) said, to discover that Charlotte Lucas, whom he (<font color='blue'><b>Bennet</b></font>) had
been used to think tolerably sensible, was as foolish as his (<font color='blue'><b>Bennet</b></font>) wife, and
more foolish than his (<font color='blue'><b>Bennet</b></font>) daughter!

<p/>Jane confessed herself a little surprised at the match; but she (<font color='blue'><b>Jane</b></font>) said
less of her (<font color='blue'><b>Jane</b></font>) astonishment than of her (<font color='blue'><b>Jane</b></font>) earnest desire for their happiness;
nor could Elizabeth persuade her (<font color='blue'><b>Elizabeth</b></font>) to consider it as improbable. Kitty
and Lydia were far from envying Miss Lucas, for Mr. Collins was only a
clergyman; and it affected them in no other way than as a piece of news
to spread at Meryton.

<p/>Lady Lucas could not be insensible of triumph on being able to retort
on Mrs. Bennet the comfort of having a daughter well married; and she (<font color='blue'><b>daughter</b></font>)
called at Longbourn rather oftener than usual to say how happy she (<font color='blue'><b>daughter</b></font>) was,
though Mrs. Bennet's sour looks and ill-natured remarks might have been
enough to drive happiness away.

<p/>Between Elizabeth and Charlotte there was a restraint which kept them
mutually silent on the subject; and Elizabeth felt persuaded that
no real confidence could ever subsist between them again. Her (<font color='blue'><b>Elizabeth</b></font>)
disappointment in Charlotte made her (<font color='blue'><b>Elizabeth</b></font>) turn with fonder regard to her (<font color='blue'><b>Elizabeth</b></font>)
sister, of whose rectitude and delicacy she (<font color='blue'><b>Elizabeth</b></font>) was sure her (<font color='blue'><b>Elizabeth</b></font>) opinion could
never be shaken, and for whose happiness she (<font color='blue'><b>Elizabeth</b></font>) grew daily more anxious,
as Bingley had now been gone a week and nothing more was heard of his (<font color='blue'><b>Bingley</b></font>)
return.

<p/>Jane had sent Caroline an early answer to her (<font color='blue'><b>Jane</b></font>) letter, and was counting
the days till she (<font color='blue'><b>Jane</b></font>) might reasonably hope to hear again. The promised
letter of thanks from Mr. Collins arrived on Tuesday, addressed to
their father, and written with all the solemnity of gratitude which a
twelvemonth's abode in the family might have prompted. After discharging
his (<font color='blue'><b>Collins</b></font>) conscience on that head, he (<font color='blue'><b>Collins</b></font>) proceeded to inform them, with many
rapturous expressions, of his (<font color='blue'><b>Collins</b></font>) happiness in having obtained the affection
of their amiable neighbour, Miss Lucas, and then explained that it was
merely with the view of enjoying her (<font color='blue'><b>Lucas</b></font>) society that he (<font color='blue'><b>Collins</b></font>) had been so ready
to close with their kind wish of seeing him (<font color='blue'><b>Collins</b></font>) again at Longbourn, whither
he (<font color='blue'><b>Collins</b></font>) hoped to be able to return on Monday fortnight; for Lady Catherine,
he (<font color='blue'><b>Collins</b></font>) added, so heartily approved his (<font color='blue'><b>Collins</b></font>) marriage, that she (<font color='blue'><b>Catherine</b></font>) wished it to take
place as soon as possible, which he (<font color='blue'><b>Collins</b></font>) trusted would be an unanswerable
argument with his (<font color='blue'><b>Collins</b></font>) amiable Charlotte to name an early day for making him (<font color='blue'><b>Collins</b></font>)
the happiest of men.

<p/>Mr. Collins's return into Hertfordshire was no longer a matter of
pleasure to Mrs. Bennet. On the contrary, she (<font color='blue'><b>Bennet</b></font>) was as much disposed to
complain of it as her (<font color='blue'><b>Bennet</b></font>) husband. It was very strange that he (<font color='blue'><b>husband</b></font>) should come
to Longbourn instead of to Lucas Lodge; it was also very inconvenient
and exceedingly troublesome. She (<font color='blue'><b>Bennet</b></font>) hated having visitors in the house
while her (<font color='blue'><b>Bennet</b></font>) health was so indifferent, and lovers were of all people the
most disagreeable. Such were the gentle murmurs of Mrs. Bennet, and
they gave way only to the greater distress of Mr. Bingley's continued
absence.

<p/>Neither Jane nor Elizabeth were comfortable on this subject. Day after
day passed away without bringing any other tidings of him (<font color='blue'><b>Bingley</b></font>) than the
report which shortly prevailed in Meryton of his (<font color='blue'><b>Bingley</b></font>) coming no more to
Netherfield the whole winter; a report which highly incensed Mrs.
Bennet, and which she (<font color='blue'><b>Bennet</b></font>) never failed to contradict as a most scandalous
falsehood.

<p/>Even Elizabeth began to fear--not that Bingley was indifferent--but that
his (<font color='blue'><b>Bingley</b></font>) sisters would be successful in keeping him (<font color='blue'><b>Bingley</b></font>) away. Unwilling as
she (<font color='blue'><b>Elizabeth</b></font>) was to admit an idea so destructive of Jane's happiness, and so
dishonorable to the stability of her (<font color='blue'><b>Jane</b></font>) lover, she (<font color='blue'><b>Jane</b></font>) could not prevent its
frequently occurring. The united efforts of his (<font color='blue'><b>lover</b></font>) two unfeeling sisters
and of his (<font color='blue'><b>lover</b></font>) overpowering friend, assisted by the attractions of Miss
Darcy and the amusements of London might be too much, she (<font color='blue'><b>Darcy</b></font>) feared, for
the strength of his (<font color='blue'><b>lover</b></font>) attachment.

<p/>As for Jane, _her (<font color='blue'><b>Jane</b></font>)_ anxiety under this suspense was, of course, more
painful than Elizabeth's, but whatever she (<font color='blue'><b>Elizabeth</b></font>) felt she (<font color='blue'><b>Elizabeth</b></font>) was desirous of
concealing, and between herself and Elizabeth, therefore, the subject
was never alluded to. But as no such delicacy restrained her (<font color='blue'><b>Elizabeth</b></font>) mother,
an hour seldom passed in which she (<font color='blue'><b>Elizabeth</b></font>) did not talk of Bingley, express her (<font color='blue'><b>Elizabeth</b></font>)
impatience for his (<font color='blue'><b>Bingley</b></font>) arrival, or even require Jane to confess that if he (<font color='blue'><b>Bingley</b></font>)
did not come back she (<font color='blue'><b>Jane</b></font>) would think herself very ill used. It needed
all Jane's steady mildness to bear these attacks with tolerable
tranquillity.

<p/>Mr. Collins returned most punctually on Monday fortnight, but his (<font color='blue'><b>Collins</b></font>)
reception at Longbourn was not quite so gracious as it had been on his (<font color='blue'><b>Collins</b></font>)
first introduction. He (<font color='blue'><b>Collins</b></font>) was too happy, however, to need much attention;
and luckily for the others, the business of love-making relieved them
from a great deal of his (<font color='blue'><b>Collins</b></font>) company. The chief of every day was spent by
him (<font color='blue'><b>Collins</b></font>) at Lucas Lodge, and he (<font color='blue'><b>Lodge</b></font>) sometimes returned to Longbourn only in time
to make an apology for his (<font color='blue'><b>Lodge</b></font>) absence before the family went to bed.

<p/>Mrs. Bennet was really in a most pitiable state. The very mention of
anything concerning the match threw her (<font color='blue'><b>Bennet</b></font>) into an agony of ill-humour,
and wherever she (<font color='blue'><b>Bennet</b></font>) went she (<font color='blue'><b>Bennet</b></font>) was sure of hearing it talked of. The sight
of Miss Lucas was odious to her (<font color='blue'><b>Lucas</b></font>). As her (<font color='blue'><b>Lucas</b></font>) successor in that house, she (<font color='blue'><b>Lucas</b></font>)
regarded her (<font color='blue'><b>Lucas</b></font>) with jealous abhorrence. Whenever Charlotte came to see
them, she (<font color='blue'><b>Charlotte</b></font>) concluded her (<font color='blue'><b>Charlotte</b></font>) to be anticipating the hour of possession; and
whenever she (<font color='blue'><b>Charlotte</b></font>) spoke in a low voice to Mr. Collins, was convinced that
they were talking of the Longbourn estate, and resolving to turn herself
and her (<font color='blue'><b>Charlotte</b></font>) daughters out of the house, as soon as Mr. Bennet were dead. She (<font color='blue'><b>Charlotte</b></font>)
complained bitterly of all this to her (<font color='blue'><b>Charlotte</b></font>) husband.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Indeed, Mr. Bennet,''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>said she (<font color='blue'><b>Charlotte</b></font>), <div class="bookquote">``it is very hard to think that Charlotte
Lucas should ever be mistress of this house, that I should be forced to
make way for _her (<font color='blue'><b>Lucas</b></font>)_, and live to see her (<font color='blue'><b>Lucas</b></font>) take her (<font color='blue'><b>Lucas</b></font>) place in it!''

 (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``My dear, do not give way to such gloomy thoughts. Let us hope for
better things. Let us flatter ourselves that I may be the survivor.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Mrs. Bennet</b></font>)</div><p/>This was not very consoling to Mrs. Bennet, and therefore, instead of
making any answer, she (<font color='blue'><b>Bennet</b></font>) went on as before.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``I cannot bear to think that they should have all this estate. If it was
not for the entail, I should not mind it.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``What should not you mind?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I should not mind anything at all.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Let us be thankful that you are preserved from a state of such
insensibility.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I never can be thankful, Mr. Bennet, for anything about the entail. How
anyone could have the conscience to entail away an estate from one's own
daughters, I cannot understand; and all for the sake of Mr. Collins too!
Why should _he (<font color='blue'><b>Collins</b></font>)_ have it more than anybody else?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I leave it to yourself to determine,''  (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Bennet</b></font>)</div>said Mr. Bennet.



<p/>Chapter 24


<p/>Miss Bingley's letter arrived, and put an end to doubt. The very first
sentence conveyed the assurance of their being all settled in London for
the winter, and concluded with her (<font color='blue'><b>Bingley</b></font>) brother's regret at not having had
time to pay his (<font color='blue'><b>brother</b></font>) respects to his (<font color='blue'><b>brother</b></font>) friends in Hertfordshire before he (<font color='blue'><b>brother</b></font>) left
the country.

<p/>Hope was over, entirely over; and when Jane could attend to the rest
of the letter, she (<font color='blue'><b>Jane</b></font>) found little, except the professed affection of the
writer, that could give her (<font color='blue'><b>Jane</b></font>) any comfort. Miss Darcy's praise occupied
the chief of it. Her (<font color='blue'><b>Jane</b></font>) many attractions were again dwelt on, and Caroline
boasted joyfully of their increasing intimacy, and ventured to predict
the accomplishment of the wishes which had been unfolded in her (<font color='blue'><b>Caroline</b></font>) former
letter. She (<font color='blue'><b>Caroline</b></font>) wrote also with great pleasure of her (<font color='blue'><b>Caroline</b></font>) brother's being an
inmate of Mr. Darcy's house, and mentioned with raptures some plans of
the latter with regard to new furniture.

<p/>Elizabeth, to whom Jane very soon communicated the chief of all this,
heard it in silent indignation. Her (<font color='blue'><b>Elizabeth</b></font>) heart was divided between concern
for her (<font color='blue'><b>Elizabeth</b></font>) sister, and resentment against all others. To Caroline's
assertion of her (<font color='blue'><b>Caroline</b></font>) brother's being partial to Miss Darcy she (<font color='blue'><b>Darcy</b></font>) paid no
credit. That he (<font color='blue'><b>brother</b></font>) was really fond of Jane, she (<font color='blue'><b>Jane</b></font>) doubted no more than she (<font color='blue'><b>Jane</b></font>)
had ever done; and much as she (<font color='blue'><b>Jane</b></font>) had always been disposed to like him (<font color='blue'><b>brother</b></font>), she (<font color='blue'><b>Jane</b></font>)
could not think without anger, hardly without contempt, on that easiness
of temper, that want of proper resolution, which now made him (<font color='blue'><b>brother</b></font>) the slave
of his (<font color='blue'><b>brother</b></font>) designing friends, and led him (<font color='blue'><b>brother</b></font>) to sacrifice of his (<font color='blue'><b>brother</b></font>) own happiness
to the caprice of their inclination. Had his (<font color='blue'><b>brother</b></font>) own happiness, however,
been the only sacrifice, he (<font color='blue'><b>brother</b></font>) might have been allowed to sport with it in
whatever manner he (<font color='blue'><b>brother</b></font>) thought best, but her (<font color='blue'><b>Jane</b></font>) sister's was involved in it, as
she (<font color='blue'><b>Jane</b></font>) thought he (<font color='blue'><b>brother</b></font>) must be sensible himself. It was a subject, in short,
on which reflection would be long indulged, and must be unavailing. She (<font color='blue'><b>Jane</b></font>)
could think of nothing else; and yet whether Bingley's regard had really
died away, or were suppressed by his (<font color='blue'><b>Bingley</b></font>) friends' interference; whether
he (<font color='blue'><b>Bingley</b></font>) had been aware of Jane's attachment, or whether it had escaped his (<font color='blue'><b>Bingley</b></font>)
observation; whatever were the case, though her (<font color='blue'><b>Jane</b></font>) opinion of him (<font color='blue'><b>Bingley</b></font>) must be
materially affected by the difference, her (<font color='blue'><b>Jane</b></font>) sister's situation remained
the same, her (<font color='blue'><b>Jane</b></font>) peace equally wounded.

<p/>A day or two passed before Jane had courage to speak of her (<font color='blue'><b>Jane</b></font>) feelings to
Elizabeth; but at last, on Mrs. Bennet's leaving them together, after a
longer irritation than usual about Netherfield and its master, she (<font color='blue'><b>Bennet</b></font>) could
not help saying:

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Oh, that my dear mother had more command over herself! She (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) can have no
idea of the pain she (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) gives me by her (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) continual reflections on him (<font color='blue'><b>Collins</b></font>). But
I will not repine. It cannot last long. He (<font color='blue'><b>Collins</b></font>) will be forgot, and we shall
all be as we were before.''

 (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div><p/>Elizabeth looked at her (<font color='blue'><b>Elizabeth</b></font>) sister with incredulous solicitude, but said
nothing.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``You doubt me,''  (<font color='red'><b>Jane</b></font>)</div>cried Jane, slightly colouring; <div class="bookquote">``indeed, you have
no reason. He (<font color='blue'><b>Collins</b></font>) may live in my memory as the most amiable man of my
acquaintance, but that is all. I have nothing either to hope or fear,
and nothing to reproach him (<font color='blue'><b>Collins</b></font>) with. Thank God! I have not _that_ pain. A
little time, therefore--I shall certainly try to get the better.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Jane</b></font>)</div><p/>With a stronger voice she (<font color='blue'><b>Jane</b></font>) soon added, <div class="bookquote">``I have this comfort immediately,
that it has not been more than an error of fancy on my side, and that it
has done no harm to anyone but myself.''

 (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``My dear Jane!''  (<font color='red'><b>Elizabeth/Miss Bennet/Miss Elizabeth</b></font>)</div>exclaimed Elizabeth, <div class="bookquote">``you are too good. Your sweetness
and disinterestedness are really angelic; I do not know what to say
to you. I feel as if I had never done you justice, or loved you as you
deserve.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Elizabeth/Miss Bennet/Miss Elizabeth</b></font>)</div><p/>Miss Bennet eagerly disclaimed all extraordinary merit, and threw back
the praise on her (<font color='blue'><b>Bennet</b></font>) sister's warm affection.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Nay,''  (<font color='red'><b>Elizabeth/Miss Bennet/Miss Elizabeth</b></font>)</div>said Elizabeth, <div class="bookquote">``this is not fair. _You_ wish to think all the
world respectable, and are hurt if I speak ill of anybody. I only want
to think _you_ perfect, and you set yourself against it. Do not
be afraid of my running into any excess, of my encroaching on your
privilege of universal good-will. You need not. There are few people
whom I really love, and still fewer of whom I think well. The more I see
of the world, the more am I dissatisfied with it; and every day confirms
my belief of the inconsistency of all human characters, and of the
little dependence that can be placed on the appearance of merit or
sense. I have met with two instances lately, one I will not mention; the
other is Charlotte's marriage. It is unaccountable! In every view it is
unaccountable!''

 (<font color='red'><b>Elizabeth/Miss Bennet/Miss Elizabeth</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``My dear Lizzy, do not give way to such feelings as these. They will
ruin your happiness. You do not make allowance enough for difference
of situation and temper. Consider Mr. Collins's respectability, and
Charlotte's steady, prudent character. Remember that she (<font color='blue'><b>Charlotte</b></font>) is one of a
large family; that as to fortune, it is a most eligible match; and be
ready to believe, for everybody's sake, that she (<font color='blue'><b>Charlotte</b></font>) may feel something like
regard and esteem for our cousin.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``To oblige you, I would try to believe almost anything, but no one else
could be benefited by such a belief as this; for were I persuaded that
Charlotte had any regard for him (<font color='blue'><b>cousin</b></font>), I should only think worse of her (<font color='blue'><b>Charlotte</b></font>)
understanding than I now do of her (<font color='blue'><b>Charlotte</b></font>) heart. My dear Jane, Mr. Collins is a
conceited, pompous, narrow-minded, silly man; you know he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) is, as well as
I do; and you must feel, as well as I do, that the woman who married him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>)
cannot have a proper way of thinking. You shall not defend her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>), though
it is Charlotte Lucas. You shall not, for the sake of one individual,
change the meaning of principle and integrity, nor endeavour to persuade
yourself or me, that selfishness is prudence, and insensibility of
danger security for happiness.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I must think your language too strong in speaking of both,''  (<font color='red'><b>Jane</b></font>)</div>replied
Jane; <div class="bookquote">``and I hope you will be convinced of it by seeing them happy
together. But enough of this. You alluded to something else. You
mentioned _two_ instances. I cannot misunderstand you, but I entreat
you, dear Lizzy, not to pain me by thinking _that person_ to blame, and
saying your opinion of him (<font color='blue'><b>you</b></font>) is sunk. We must not be so ready to fancy
ourselves intentionally injured. We must not expect a lively young man
to be always so guarded and circumspect. It is very often nothing but
our own vanity that deceives us. Women fancy admiration means more than
it does.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Jane</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``And men take care that they should.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``If it is designedly done, they cannot be justified; but I have no idea
of there being so much design in the world as some persons imagine.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I am far from attributing any part of Mr. Bingley's conduct to design,''
 (<font color='red'><b>Elizabeth/Miss Bennet/Miss Elizabeth</b></font>)</div>said Elizabeth; <div class="bookquote">``but without scheming to do wrong, or to make others
unhappy, there may be error, and there may be misery. Thoughtlessness,
want of attention to other people's feelings, and want of resolution,
will do the business.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Elizabeth/Miss Bennet/Miss Elizabeth</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``And do you impute it to either of those?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Yes; to the last. But if I go on, I shall displease you by saying what
I think of persons you esteem. Stop me whilst you can.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``You persist, then, in supposing his (<font color='blue'><b>others</b></font>) sisters influence him (<font color='blue'><b>others</b></font>)?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Yes, in conjunction with his (<font color='blue'><b>others</b></font>) friend.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I cannot believe it. Why should they try to influence him (<font color='blue'><b>others</b></font>)? They can
only wish his (<font color='blue'><b>others</b></font>) happiness; and if he (<font color='blue'><b>others</b></font>) is attached to me, no other woman can
secure it.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Your first position is false. They may wish many things besides his (<font color='blue'><b>others</b></font>)
happiness; they may wish his (<font color='blue'><b>others</b></font>) increase of wealth and consequence; they
may wish him (<font color='blue'><b>others</b></font>) to marry a girl who has all the importance of money, great
connections, and pride.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Beyond a doubt, they _do_ wish him (<font color='blue'><b>others</b></font>) to choose Miss Darcy,''  (<font color='red'><b>Jane</b></font>)</div>replied Jane;
<div class="bookquote">``but this may be from better feelings than you are supposing. They have
known her (<font color='blue'><b>Darcy</b></font>) much longer than they have known me; no wonder if they love
her (<font color='blue'><b>Darcy</b></font>) better. But, whatever may be their own wishes, it is very unlikely
they should have opposed their brother's. What sister would think
herself at liberty to do it, unless there were something very
objectionable? If they believed him (<font color='blue'><b>brother</b></font>) attached to me, they would not try
to part us; if he (<font color='blue'><b>brother</b></font>) were so, they could not succeed. By supposing such an
affection, you make everybody acting unnaturally and wrong, and me most
unhappy. Do not distress me by the idea. I am not ashamed of having been
mistaken--or, at least, it is light, it is nothing in comparison of what
I should feel in thinking ill of him (<font color='blue'><b>brother</b></font>) or his (<font color='blue'><b>brother</b></font>) sisters. Let me take it in
the best light, in the light in which it may be understood.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Jane</b></font>)</div><p/>Elizabeth could not oppose such a wish; and from this time Mr. Bingley's
name was scarcely ever mentioned between them.

<p/>Mrs. Bennet still continued to wonder and repine at his (<font color='blue'><b>Bingley</b></font>) returning no
more, and though a day seldom passed in which Elizabeth did not account
for it clearly, there was little chance of her (<font color='blue'><b>Elizabeth</b></font>) ever considering it with
less perplexity. Her (<font color='blue'><b>Elizabeth</b></font>) daughter endeavoured to convince her (<font color='blue'><b>Elizabeth</b></font>) of what she (<font color='blue'><b>Elizabeth</b></font>)
did not believe herself, that his (<font color='blue'><b>Bingley</b></font>) attentions to Jane had been merely the
effect of a common and transient liking, which ceased when he (<font color='blue'><b>Bingley</b></font>) saw her (<font color='blue'><b>Jane</b></font>)
no more; but though the probability of the statement was admitted at
the time, she (<font color='blue'><b>Jane</b></font>) had the same story to repeat every day. Mrs. Bennet's best
comfort was that Mr. Bingley must be down again in the summer.

<p/>Mr. Bennet treated the matter differently. <div class="bookquote">``So, Lizzy,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>said he (<font color='blue'><b>Bennet</b></font>) one day,
<div class="bookquote">``your sister is crossed in love, I find. I congratulate her (<font color='blue'><b>sister</b></font>). Next to
being married, a girl likes to be crossed a little in love now and then.
It is something to think of, and it gives her (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) a sort of distinction
among her (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) companions. When is your turn to come? You will hardly bear to
be long outdone by Jane. Now is your time. Here are officers enough in
Meryton to disappoint all the young ladies in the country. Let Wickham
be _your_ man. He (<font color='blue'><b>Wickham</b></font>) is a pleasant fellow, and would jilt you creditably.''

 (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Thank you, sir, but a less agreeable man would satisfy me. We must not
all expect Jane's good fortune.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``True,''  (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Bennet</b></font>)</div>said Mr. Bennet, <div class="bookquote">``but it is a comfort to think that whatever of
that kind may befall you, you have an affectionate mother who will make
the most of it.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Bennet</b></font>)</div><p/>Mr. Wickham's society was of material service in dispelling the gloom
which the late perverse occurrences had thrown on many of the Longbourn
family. They saw him (<font color='blue'><b>Bennet</b></font>) often, and to his (<font color='blue'><b>Bennet</b></font>) other recommendations was now
added that of general unreserve. The whole of what Elizabeth had already
heard, his (<font color='blue'><b>Bennet</b></font>) claims on Mr. Darcy, and all that he (<font color='blue'><b>Bennet</b></font>) had suffered from him (<font color='blue'><b>Bennet</b></font>),
was now openly acknowledged and publicly canvassed; and everybody was
pleased to know how much they had always disliked Mr. Darcy before they
had known anything of the matter.

<p/>Miss Bennet was the only creature who could suppose there might be
any extenuating circumstances in the case, unknown to the society
of Hertfordshire; her (<font color='blue'><b>Bennet</b></font>) mild and steady candour always pleaded for
allowances, and urged the possibility of mistakes--but by everybody else
Mr. Darcy was condemned as the worst of men.



<p/>Chapter 25


<p/>After a week spent in professions of love and schemes of felicity,
Mr. Collins was called from his (<font color='blue'><b>Collins</b></font>) amiable Charlotte by the arrival of
Saturday. The pain of separation, however, might be alleviated on his (<font color='blue'><b>Collins</b></font>)
side, by preparations for the reception of his (<font color='blue'><b>Collins</b></font>) bride; as he (<font color='blue'><b>Collins</b></font>) had reason
to hope, that shortly after his (<font color='blue'><b>Collins</b></font>) return into Hertfordshire, the day would
be fixed that was to make him (<font color='blue'><b>Collins</b></font>) the happiest of men. He (<font color='blue'><b>Collins</b></font>) took leave of his (<font color='blue'><b>Collins</b></font>)
relations at Longbourn with as much solemnity as before; wished his (<font color='blue'><b>Collins</b></font>) fair
cousins health and happiness again, and promised their father another
letter of thanks.

<p/>On the following Monday, Mrs. Bennet had the pleasure of receiving
her (<font color='blue'><b>Bennet</b></font>) brother and his (<font color='blue'><b>brother</b></font>) wife, who came as usual to spend the Christmas
at Longbourn. Mr. Gardiner was a sensible, gentlemanlike man, greatly
superior to his (<font color='blue'><b>Gardiner</b></font>) sister, as well by nature as education. The Netherfield
ladies would have had difficulty in believing that a man who lived
by trade, and within view of his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) own warehouses, could have been so
well-bred and agreeable. Mrs. Gardiner, who was several years younger
than Mrs. Bennet and Mrs. Phillips, was an amiable, intelligent, elegant
woman, and a great favourite with all her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) Longbourn nieces. Between the
two eldest and herself especially, there subsisted a particular regard.
They had frequently been staying with her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) in town.

<p/>The first part of Mrs. Gardiner's business on her (<font color='blue'><b>Gardiner</b></font>) arrival was to
distribute her (<font color='blue'><b>Gardiner</b></font>) presents and describe the newest fashions. When this was
done she (<font color='blue'><b>Gardiner</b></font>) had a less active part to play. It became her (<font color='blue'><b>Gardiner</b></font>) turn to listen.
Mrs. Bennet had many grievances to relate, and much to complain of. They
had all been very ill-used since she (<font color='blue'><b>Bennet</b></font>) last saw her (<font color='blue'><b>Bennet</b></font>) sister. Two of her (<font color='blue'><b>Bennet</b></font>)
girls had been upon the point of marriage, and after all there was
nothing in it.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``I do not blame Jane,''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Bennet</b></font>) continued, <div class="bookquote">``for Jane would have got Mr.
Bingley if she (<font color='blue'><b>Jane</b></font>) could. But Lizzy! Oh, sister! It is very hard to think
that she (<font color='blue'><b>Jane</b></font>) might have been Mr. Collins's wife by this time, had it not
been for her (<font color='blue'><b>Jane</b></font>) own perverseness. He (<font color='blue'><b>Collins</b></font>) made her (<font color='blue'><b>Jane</b></font>) an offer in this very room,
and she (<font color='blue'><b>Jane</b></font>) refused him (<font color='blue'><b>Collins</b></font>). The consequence of it is, that Lady Lucas will have
a daughter married before I have, and that the Longbourn estate is just
as much entailed as ever. The Lucases are very artful people indeed,
sister. They are all for what they can get. I am sorry to say it of
them, but so it is. It makes me very nervous and poorly, to be thwarted
so in my own family, and to have neighbours who think of themselves
before anybody else. However, your coming just at this time is the
greatest of comforts, and I am very glad to hear what you tell us, of
long sleeves.''

 (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div><p/>Mrs. Gardiner, to whom the chief of this news had been given before,
in the course of Jane and Elizabeth's correspondence with her (<font color='blue'><b>Jane</b></font>), made her (<font color='blue'><b>Jane</b></font>)
sister a slight answer, and, in compassion to her (<font color='blue'><b>Jane</b></font>) nieces, turned the
conversation.

<p/>When alone with Elizabeth afterwards, she (<font color='blue'><b>Elizabeth</b></font>) spoke more on the subject. <div class="bookquote">``It
seems likely to have been a desirable match for Jane,''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>said she (<font color='blue'><b>Elizabeth</b></font>). <div class="bookquote">``I am
sorry it went off. But these things happen so often! A young man, such
as you describe Mr. Bingley, so easily falls in love with a pretty girl
for a few weeks, and when accident separates them, so easily forgets
her (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>), that these sort of inconsistencies are very frequent.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``An excellent consolation in its way,''  (<font color='red'><b>Elizabeth/Miss Bennet/Miss Elizabeth</b></font>)</div>said Elizabeth, <div class="bookquote">``but it will not
do for _us_. We do not suffer by _accident_. It does not often
happen that the interference of friends will persuade a young man of
independent fortune to think no more of a girl whom he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) was violently in
love with only a few days before.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Elizabeth/Miss Bennet/Miss Elizabeth</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``But that expression of `violently in love' is so hackneyed, so
doubtful, so indefinite, that it gives me very little idea. It is as
often applied to feelings which arise from a half-hour's acquaintance,
as to a real, strong attachment. Pray, how _violent was_ Mr. Bingley's
love?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I never saw a more promising inclination; he (<font color='blue'><b>Bingley</b></font>) was growing quite
inattentive to other people, and wholly engrossed by her (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>). Every time
they met, it was more decided and remarkable. At his (<font color='blue'><b>Bingley</b></font>) own ball he (<font color='blue'><b>Bingley</b></font>)
offended two or three young ladies, by not asking them to dance; and I
spoke to him (<font color='blue'><b>Bingley</b></font>) twice myself, without receiving an answer. Could there be
finer symptoms? Is not general incivility the very essence of love?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Oh, yes!--of that kind of love which I suppose him (<font color='blue'><b>Bingley</b></font>) to have felt. Poor
Jane! I am sorry for her (<font color='blue'><b>Jane</b></font>), because, with her (<font color='blue'><b>Jane</b></font>) disposition, she (<font color='blue'><b>Jane</b></font>) may not get
over it immediately. It had better have happened to _you_, Lizzy; you
would have laughed yourself out of it sooner. But do you think she (<font color='blue'><b>Lizzy</b></font>)
would be prevailed upon to go back with us? Change of scene might be
of service--and perhaps a little relief from home may be as useful as
anything.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Elizabeth/Miss Bennet/Miss Elizabeth</b></font>)</div><p/>Elizabeth was exceedingly pleased with this proposal, and felt persuaded
of her (<font color='blue'><b>Elizabeth</b></font>) sister's ready acquiescence.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``I hope,''  (<font color='red'><b>Mrs. Gardiner/Gardiner/GARDINER</b></font>)</div>added Mrs. Gardiner, <div class="bookquote">``that no consideration with regard to
this young man will influence her (<font color='blue'><b>Lizzy</b></font>). We live in so different a part of
town, all our connections are so different, and, as you well know, we go
out so little, that it is very improbable that they should meet at all,
unless he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) really comes to see her (<font color='blue'><b>Lizzy</b></font>).''

 (<font color='red'><b>Mrs. Gardiner/Gardiner/GARDINER</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``And _that_ is quite impossible; for he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) is now in the custody of his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>)
friend, and Mr. Darcy would no more suffer him (<font color='blue'><b>Darcy</b></font>) to call on Jane in such
a part of London! My dear aunt, how could you think of it? Mr. Darcy may
perhaps have _heard_ of such a place as Gracechurch Street, but he (<font color='blue'><b>Darcy</b></font>)
would hardly think a month's ablution enough to cleanse him (<font color='blue'><b>Darcy</b></font>) from its
impurities, were he (<font color='blue'><b>Darcy</b></font>) once to enter it; and depend upon it, Mr. Bingley
never stirs without him (<font color='blue'><b>Bingley</b></font>).''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``So much the better. I hope they will not meet at all. But does not Jane
correspond with his (<font color='blue'><b>Bingley</b></font>) sister? _She (<font color='blue'><b>Jane</b></font>)_ will not be able to help calling.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``She (<font color='blue'><b>Jane</b></font>) will drop the acquaintance entirely.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Elizabeth/Miss Bennet/Miss Elizabeth</b></font>)</div><p/>But in spite of the certainty in which Elizabeth affected to place this
point, as well as the still more interesting one of Bingley's being
withheld from seeing Jane, she (<font color='blue'><b>Jane</b></font>) felt a solicitude on the subject which
convinced her (<font color='blue'><b>Jane</b></font>), on examination, that she (<font color='blue'><b>Jane</b></font>) did not consider it entirely
hopeless. It was possible, and sometimes she (<font color='blue'><b>Jane</b></font>) thought it probable, that
his (<font color='blue'><b>Bingley</b></font>) affection might be reanimated, and the influence of his (<font color='blue'><b>Bingley</b></font>) friends
successfully combated by the more natural influence of Jane's
attractions.

<p/>Miss Bennet accepted her (<font color='blue'><b>Bennet</b></font>) aunt's invitation with pleasure; and the
Bingleys were no otherwise in her (<font color='blue'><b>Bennet</b></font>) thoughts at the same time, than as she (<font color='blue'><b>Bennet</b></font>)
hoped by Caroline's not living in the same house with her (<font color='blue'><b>Bennet</b></font>) brother,
she (<font color='blue'><b>Bennet</b></font>) might occasionally spend a morning with her (<font color='blue'><b>Bennet</b></font>), without any danger of
seeing him (<font color='blue'><b>brother</b></font>).

<p/>The Gardiners stayed a week at Longbourn; and what with the Phillipses,
the Lucases, and the officers, there was not a day without its
engagement. Mrs. Bennet had so carefully provided for the entertainment
of her (<font color='blue'><b>Bennet</b></font>) brother and sister, that they did not once sit down to a family
dinner. When the engagement was for home, some of the officers always
made part of it--of which officers Mr. Wickham was sure to be one; and
on these occasions, Mrs. Gardiner, rendered suspicious by Elizabeth's
warm commendation, narrowly observed them both. Without supposing them,
from what she (<font color='blue'><b>Gardiner</b></font>) saw, to be very seriously in love, their preference
of each other was plain enough to make her (<font color='blue'><b>Gardiner</b></font>) a little uneasy; and
she (<font color='blue'><b>Gardiner</b></font>) resolved to speak to Elizabeth on the subject before she (<font color='blue'><b>Elizabeth</b></font>) left
Hertfordshire, and represent to her (<font color='blue'><b>Elizabeth</b></font>) the imprudence of encouraging such
an attachment.

<p/>To Mrs. Gardiner, Wickham had one means of affording pleasure,
unconnected with his (<font color='blue'><b>Wickham</b></font>) general powers. About ten or a dozen years ago,
before her (<font color='blue'><b>Gardiner</b></font>) marriage, she (<font color='blue'><b>Gardiner</b></font>) had spent a considerable time in that very
part of Derbyshire to which he (<font color='blue'><b>Wickham</b></font>) belonged. They had, therefore, many
acquaintances in common; and though Wickham had been little there since
the death of Darcy's father, it was yet in his (<font color='blue'><b>Wickham</b></font>) power to give her (<font color='blue'><b>Gardiner</b></font>) fresher
intelligence of her (<font color='blue'><b>Gardiner</b></font>) former friends than she (<font color='blue'><b>Gardiner</b></font>) had been in the way of
procuring.

<p/>Mrs. Gardiner had seen Pemberley, and known the late Mr. Darcy by
character perfectly well. Here consequently was an inexhaustible subject
of discourse. In comparing her (<font color='blue'><b>Gardiner</b></font>) recollection of Pemberley with the minute
description which Wickham could give, and in bestowing her (<font color='blue'><b>Gardiner</b></font>) tribute of
praise on the character of its late possessor, she (<font color='blue'><b>Gardiner</b></font>) was delighting both
him (<font color='blue'><b>Wickham</b></font>) and herself. On being made acquainted with the present Mr. Darcy's
treatment of him (<font color='blue'><b>Darcy</b></font>), she (<font color='blue'><b>Gardiner</b></font>) tried to remember some of that gentleman's
reputed disposition when quite a lad which might agree with it, and
was confident at last that she (<font color='blue'><b>Gardiner</b></font>) recollected having heard Mr. Fitzwilliam
Darcy formerly spoken of as a very proud, ill-natured boy.



<p/>Chapter 26


<p/>Mrs. Gardiner's caution to Elizabeth was punctually and kindly given
on the first favourable opportunity of speaking to her (<font color='blue'><b>Elizabeth</b></font>) alone; after
honestly telling her (<font color='blue'><b>Elizabeth</b></font>) what she (<font color='blue'><b>Elizabeth</b></font>) thought, she (<font color='blue'><b>Elizabeth</b></font>) thus went on:

<p/><div class="bookquote">``You are too sensible a girl, Lizzy, to fall in love merely because
you are warned against it; and, therefore, I am not afraid of speaking
openly. Seriously, I would have you be on your guard. Do not involve
yourself or endeavour to involve him (<font color='blue'><b>guard</b></font>) in an affection which the want
of fortune would make so very imprudent. I have nothing to say against
_him (<font color='blue'><b>guard</b></font>)_; he (<font color='blue'><b>guard</b></font>) is a most interesting young man; and if he (<font color='blue'><b>guard</b></font>) had the fortune he (<font color='blue'><b>guard</b></font>)
ought to have, I should think you could not do better. But as it is, you
must not let your fancy run away with you. You have sense, and we all
expect you to use it. Your father would depend on _your_ resolution and
good conduct, I am sure. You must not disappoint your father.''

 (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``My dear aunt, this is being serious indeed.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Yes, and I hope to engage you to be serious likewise.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Well, then, you need not be under any alarm. I will take care of
myself, and of Mr. Wickham too. He (<font color='blue'><b>Wickham</b></font>) shall not be in love with me, if I
can prevent it.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Elizabeth, you are not serious now.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I beg your pardon, I will try again. At present I am not in love with
Mr. Wickham; no, I certainly am not. But he (<font color='blue'><b>Wickham</b></font>) is, beyond all comparison,
the most agreeable man I ever saw--and if he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) becomes really attached to
me--I believe it will be better that he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) should not. I see the imprudence
of it. Oh! _that_ abominable Mr. Darcy! My father's opinion of me does
me the greatest honour, and I should be miserable to forfeit it. My
father, however, is partial to Mr. Wickham. In short, my dear aunt, I
should be very sorry to be the means of making any of you unhappy; but
since we see every day that where there is affection, young people
are seldom withheld by immediate want of fortune from entering into
engagements with each other, how can I promise to be wiser than so many
of my fellow-creatures if I am tempted, or how am I even to know that it
would be wisdom to resist? All that I can promise you, therefore, is not
to be in a hurry. I will not be in a hurry to believe myself his (<font color='blue'><b>I</b></font>) first
object. When I am in company with him (<font color='blue'><b>I</b></font>), I will not be wishing. In short,
I will do my best.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Perhaps it will be as well if you discourage his (<font color='blue'><b>I</b></font>) coming here so very
often. At least, you should not _remind_ your mother of inviting him (<font color='blue'><b>I</b></font>).''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``As I did the other day,''  (<font color='red'><b>Elizabeth/Miss Bennet/Miss Elizabeth</b></font>)</div>said Elizabeth with a conscious smile: <div class="bookquote">``very
true, it will be wise in me to refrain from _that_. But do not imagine
that he (<font color='blue'><b>I</b></font>) is always here so often. It is on your account that he (<font color='blue'><b>I</b></font>) has been
so frequently invited this week. You know my mother's ideas as to the
necessity of constant company for her (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) friends. But really, and upon my
honour, I will try to do what I think to be the wisest; and now I hope
you are satisfied.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Elizabeth/Miss Bennet/Miss Elizabeth</b></font>)</div><p/>Her (<font color='blue'><b>Elizabeth</b></font>) aunt assured her (<font color='blue'><b>Elizabeth</b></font>) that she (<font color='blue'><b>Elizabeth</b></font>) was, and Elizabeth having thanked her (<font color='blue'><b>Elizabeth</b></font>) for
the kindness of her (<font color='blue'><b>Elizabeth</b></font>) hints, they parted; a wonderful instance of advice
being given on such a point, without being resented.

<p/>Mr. Collins returned into Hertfordshire soon after it had been quitted
by the Gardiners and Jane; but as he (<font color='blue'><b>Collins</b></font>) took up his (<font color='blue'><b>Collins</b></font>) abode with the Lucases,
his (<font color='blue'><b>Collins</b></font>) arrival was no great inconvenience to Mrs. Bennet. His (<font color='blue'><b>Collins</b></font>) marriage was
now fast approaching, and she (<font color='blue'><b>Bennet</b></font>) was at length so far resigned as to think
it inevitable, and even repeatedly to say, in an ill-natured tone, that
she (<font color='blue'><b>Bennet</b></font>) <div class="bookquote">''_wished_ they might be happy.''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>Thursday was to be the wedding day,
and on Wednesday Miss Lucas paid her (<font color='blue'><b>Lucas</b></font>) farewell visit; and when she (<font color='blue'><b>Lucas</b></font>)
rose to take leave, Elizabeth, ashamed of her (<font color='blue'><b>Elizabeth</b></font>) mother's ungracious and
reluctant good wishes, and sincerely affected herself, accompanied her (<font color='blue'><b>Elizabeth</b></font>)
out of the room. As they went downstairs together, Charlotte said:

<p/><div class="bookquote">``I shall depend on hearing from you very often, Eliza.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Charlotte Lucas/Charlotte</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">''_That_ you certainly shall.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Charlotte Lucas/Charlotte</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``And I have another favour to ask you. Will you come and see me?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``We shall often meet, I hope, in Hertfordshire.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I am not likely to leave Kent for some time. Promise me, therefore, to
come to Hunsford.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Elizabeth/Miss Bennet/Miss Elizabeth</b></font>)</div><p/>Elizabeth could not refuse, though she (<font color='blue'><b>Elizabeth</b></font>) foresaw little pleasure in the
visit.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``My father and Maria are coming to me in March,''  (<font color='red'><b>Charlotte</b></font>)</div>added Charlotte, <div class="bookquote">``and I
hope you will consent to be of the party. Indeed, Eliza, you will be as
welcome as either of them.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Charlotte</b></font>)</div><p/>The wedding took place; the bride and bridegroom set off for Kent from
the church door, and everybody had as much to say, or to hear, on
the subject as usual. Elizabeth soon heard from her (<font color='blue'><b>Elizabeth</b></font>) friend; and their
correspondence was as regular and frequent as it had ever been; that
it should be equally unreserved was impossible. Elizabeth could never
address her (<font color='blue'><b>Elizabeth</b></font>) without feeling that all the comfort of intimacy was over,
and though determined not to slacken as a correspondent, it was for the
sake of what had been, rather than what was. Charlotte's first letters
were received with a good deal of eagerness; there could not but be
curiosity to know how she (<font color='blue'><b>Charlotte</b></font>) would speak of her (<font color='blue'><b>Charlotte</b></font>) new home, how she (<font color='blue'><b>Charlotte</b></font>) would
like Lady Catherine, and how happy she (<font color='blue'><b>Charlotte</b></font>) would dare pronounce herself to
be; though, when the letters were read, Elizabeth felt that Charlotte
expressed herself on every point exactly as she (<font color='blue'><b>Charlotte</b></font>) might have foreseen. She (<font color='blue'><b>Charlotte</b></font>)
wrote cheerfully, seemed surrounded with comforts, and mentioned nothing
which she (<font color='blue'><b>Charlotte</b></font>) could not praise. The house, furniture, neighbourhood, and
roads, were all to her (<font color='blue'><b>Charlotte</b></font>) taste, and Lady Catherine's behaviour was most
friendly and obliging. It was Mr. Collins's picture of Hunsford and
Rosings rationally softened; and Elizabeth perceived that she (<font color='blue'><b>Elizabeth</b></font>) must wait
for her (<font color='blue'><b>Elizabeth</b></font>) own visit there to know the rest.

<p/>Jane had already written a few lines to her (<font color='blue'><b>Jane</b></font>) sister to announce their
safe arrival in London; and when she (<font color='blue'><b>Jane</b></font>) wrote again, Elizabeth hoped it
would be in her (<font color='blue'><b>Elizabeth</b></font>) power to say something of the Bingleys.

<p/>Her (<font color='blue'><b>Elizabeth</b></font>) impatience for this second letter was as well rewarded as impatience
generally is. Jane had been a week in town without either seeing or
hearing from Caroline. She (<font color='blue'><b>Caroline</b></font>) accounted for it, however, by supposing that
her (<font color='blue'><b>Caroline</b></font>) last letter to her (<font color='blue'><b>Caroline</b></font>) friend from Longbourn had by some accident been
lost.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``My aunt,''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Caroline</b></font>) continued, <div class="bookquote">``is going to-morrow into that part of the
town, and I shall take the opportunity of calling in Grosvenor Street.''

 (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div><p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>Caroline</b></font>) wrote again when the visit was paid, and she (<font color='blue'><b>Caroline</b></font>) had seen Miss Bingley.
<div class="bookquote">``I did not think Caroline in spirits,''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>were her (<font color='blue'><b>Caroline</b></font>) words, <div class="bookquote">``but she (<font color='blue'><b>Caroline</b></font>) was very
glad to see me, and reproached me for giving her (<font color='blue'><b>Caroline</b></font>) no notice of my coming
to London. I was right, therefore, my last letter had never reached
her (<font color='blue'><b>Caroline</b></font>). I inquired after their brother, of course. He (<font color='blue'><b>brother</b></font>) was well, but so much
engaged with Mr. Darcy that they scarcely ever saw him (<font color='blue'><b>Darcy</b></font>). I found that
Miss Darcy was expected to dinner. I wish I could see her (<font color='blue'><b>Darcy</b></font>). My visit was
not long, as Caroline and Mrs. Hurst were going out. I dare say I shall
see them soon here.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Elizabeth/Miss Bennet/Miss Elizabeth</b></font>)</div><p/>Elizabeth shook her (<font color='blue'><b>Elizabeth</b></font>) head over this letter. It convinced her (<font color='blue'><b>Elizabeth</b></font>) that
accident only could discover to Mr. Bingley her (<font color='blue'><b>Elizabeth</b></font>) sister's being in town.

<p/>Four weeks passed away, and Jane saw nothing of him (<font color='blue'><b>Bingley</b></font>). She (<font color='blue'><b>Jane</b></font>) endeavoured to
persuade herself that she (<font color='blue'><b>Jane</b></font>) did not regret it; but she (<font color='blue'><b>Jane</b></font>) could no longer be
blind to Miss Bingley's inattention. After waiting at home every morning
for a fortnight, and inventing every evening a fresh excuse for her (<font color='blue'><b>Bingley</b></font>), the
visitor did at last appear; but the shortness of her (<font color='blue'><b>Bingley</b></font>) stay, and yet more,
the alteration of her (<font color='blue'><b>Bingley</b></font>) manner would allow Jane to deceive herself no
longer. The letter which she (<font color='blue'><b>Jane</b></font>) wrote on this occasion to her (<font color='blue'><b>Jane</b></font>) sister will
prove what she (<font color='blue'><b>Jane</b></font>) felt.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``My dearest Lizzy will, I am sure, be incapable of triumphing in her (<font color='blue'><b>Lizzy</b></font>)
better judgement, at my expense, when I confess myself to have been
entirely deceived in Miss Bingley's regard for me. But, my dear sister,
though the event has proved you right, do not think me obstinate if I
still assert that, considering what her (<font color='blue'><b>sister</b></font>) behaviour was, my confidence was
as natural as your suspicion. I do not at all comprehend her (<font color='blue'><b>sister</b></font>) reason for
wishing to be intimate with me; but if the same circumstances were to
happen again, I am sure I should be deceived again. Caroline did not
return my visit till yesterday; and not a note, not a line, did I
receive in the meantime. When she (<font color='blue'><b>Caroline</b></font>) did come, it was very evident that
she (<font color='blue'><b>Caroline</b></font>) had no pleasure in it; she (<font color='blue'><b>Caroline</b></font>) made a slight, formal apology, for not
calling before, said not a word of wishing to see me again, and was
in every respect so altered a creature, that when she (<font color='blue'><b>Caroline</b></font>) went away I was
perfectly resolved to continue the acquaintance no longer. I pity,
though I cannot help blaming her (<font color='blue'><b>Caroline</b></font>). She (<font color='blue'><b>Caroline</b></font>) was very wrong in singling me out
as she (<font color='blue'><b>Caroline</b></font>) did; I can safely say that every advance to intimacy began on
her (<font color='blue'><b>Caroline</b></font>) side. But I pity her (<font color='blue'><b>Caroline</b></font>), because she (<font color='blue'><b>Caroline</b></font>) must feel that she (<font color='blue'><b>Caroline</b></font>) has been acting
wrong, and because I am very sure that anxiety for her (<font color='blue'><b>Caroline</b></font>) brother is the
cause of it. I need not explain myself farther; and though _we_ know
this anxiety to be quite needless, yet if she (<font color='blue'><b>Caroline</b></font>) feels it, it will easily
account for her (<font color='blue'><b>Caroline</b></font>) behaviour to me; and so deservedly dear as he (<font color='blue'><b>brother</b></font>) is to
his (<font color='blue'><b>brother</b></font>) sister, whatever anxiety she (<font color='blue'><b>sister</b></font>) must feel on his (<font color='blue'><b>brother</b></font>) behalf is natural and
amiable. I cannot but wonder, however, at her (<font color='blue'><b>sister</b></font>) having any such fears now,
because, if he (<font color='blue'><b>brother</b></font>) had at all cared about me, we must have met, long ago.
He (<font color='blue'><b>brother</b></font>) knows of my being in town, I am certain, from something she (<font color='blue'><b>sister</b></font>) said
herself; and yet it would seem, by her (<font color='blue'><b>sister</b></font>) manner of talking, as if she (<font color='blue'><b>sister</b></font>)
wanted to persuade herself that he (<font color='blue'><b>brother</b></font>) is really partial to Miss Darcy. I
cannot understand it. If I were not afraid of judging harshly, I should
be almost tempted to say that there is a strong appearance of duplicity
in all this. But I will endeavour to banish every painful thought,
and think only of what will make me happy--your affection, and the
invariable kindness of my dear uncle and aunt. Let me hear from you very
soon. Miss Bingley said something of his (<font color='blue'><b>uncle</b></font>) never returning to Netherfield
again, of giving up the house, but not with any certainty. We had better
not mention it. I am extremely glad that you have such pleasant accounts
from our friends at Hunsford. Pray go to see them, with Sir William and
Maria. I am sure you will be very comfortable there.--Yours, etc.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Elizabeth/Miss Bennet/Miss Elizabeth</b></font>)</div><p/>This letter gave Elizabeth some pain; but her (<font color='blue'><b>Elizabeth</b></font>) spirits returned as she (<font color='blue'><b>Elizabeth</b></font>)
considered that Jane would no longer be duped, by the sister at least.
All expectation from the brother was now absolutely over. She (<font color='blue'><b>Jane</b></font>) would not
even wish for a renewal of his (<font color='blue'><b>brother</b></font>) attentions. His (<font color='blue'><b>brother</b></font>) character sunk on
every review of it; and as a punishment for him (<font color='blue'><b>brother</b></font>), as well as a possible
advantage to Jane, she (<font color='blue'><b>Jane</b></font>) seriously hoped he (<font color='blue'><b>brother</b></font>) might really soon marry Mr.
Darcy's sister, as by Wickham's account, she (<font color='blue'><b>Jane</b></font>) would make him (<font color='blue'><b>Wickham</b></font>) abundantly
regret what he (<font color='blue'><b>Wickham</b></font>) had thrown away.

<p/>Mrs. Gardiner about this time reminded Elizabeth of her (<font color='blue'><b>Gardiner</b></font>) promise
concerning that gentleman, and required information; and Elizabeth
had such to send as might rather give contentment to her (<font color='blue'><b>Elizabeth</b></font>) aunt than to
herself. His (<font color='blue'><b>gentleman</b></font>) apparent partiality had subsided, his (<font color='blue'><b>gentleman</b></font>) attentions were over,
he (<font color='blue'><b>gentleman</b></font>) was the admirer of some one else. Elizabeth was watchful enough to
see it all, but she (<font color='blue'><b>Elizabeth</b></font>) could see it and write of it without material pain.
Her (<font color='blue'><b>Elizabeth</b></font>) heart had been but slightly touched, and her (<font color='blue'><b>Elizabeth</b></font>) vanity was satisfied
with believing that _she (<font color='blue'><b>Elizabeth</b></font>)_ would have been his (<font color='blue'><b>gentleman</b></font>) only choice, had fortune
permitted it. The sudden acquisition of ten thousand pounds was the most
remarkable charm of the young lady to whom he (<font color='blue'><b>gentleman</b></font>) was now rendering himself
agreeable; but Elizabeth, less clear-sighted perhaps in this case than
in Charlotte's, did not quarrel with him (<font color='blue'><b>gentleman</b></font>) for his (<font color='blue'><b>gentleman</b></font>) wish of independence.
Nothing, on the contrary, could be more natural; and while able to
suppose that it cost him (<font color='blue'><b>gentleman</b></font>) a few struggles to relinquish her (<font color='blue'><b>Charlotte</b></font>), she (<font color='blue'><b>Charlotte</b></font>) was
ready to allow it a wise and desirable measure for both, and could very
sincerely wish him (<font color='blue'><b>gentleman</b></font>) happy.

<p/>All this was acknowledged to Mrs. Gardiner; and after relating the
circumstances, she (<font color='blue'><b>Gardiner</b></font>) thus went on: <div class="bookquote">``I am now convinced, my dear aunt, that
I have never been much in love; for had I really experienced that pure
and elevating passion, I should at present detest his (<font color='blue'><b>William</b></font>) very name, and
wish him (<font color='blue'><b>William</b></font>) all manner of evil. But my feelings are not only cordial
towards _him (<font color='blue'><b>William</b></font>)_; they are even impartial towards Miss King. I cannot find
out that I hate her (<font color='blue'><b>King</b></font>) at all, or that I am in the least unwilling to
think her (<font color='blue'><b>King</b></font>) a very good sort of girl. There can be no love in all this. My
watchfulness has been effectual; and though I certainly should be a more
interesting object to all my acquaintances were I distractedly in love
with him (<font color='blue'><b>acquaintances</b></font>), I cannot say that I regret my comparative insignificance.
Importance may sometimes be purchased too dearly. Kitty and Lydia take
his (<font color='blue'><b>acquaintances</b></font>) defection much more to heart than I do. They are young in the
ways of the world, and not yet open to the mortifying conviction that
handsome young men must have something to live on as well as the plain.''



 (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div><p/>Chapter 27


<p/>With no greater events than these in the Longbourn family, and otherwise
diversified by little beyond the walks to Meryton, sometimes dirty and
sometimes cold, did January and February pass away. March was to take
Elizabeth to Hunsford. She (<font color='blue'><b>Elizabeth</b></font>) had not at first thought very seriously of
going thither; but Charlotte, she (<font color='blue'><b>Charlotte</b></font>) soon found, was depending on the plan
and she (<font color='blue'><b>Charlotte</b></font>) gradually learned to consider it herself with greater pleasure
as well as greater certainty. Absence had increased her (<font color='blue'><b>Charlotte</b></font>) desire of seeing
Charlotte again, and weakened her (<font color='blue'><b>Charlotte</b></font>) disgust of Mr. Collins. There
was novelty in the scheme, and as, with such a mother and such
uncompanionable sisters, home could not be faultless, a little change
was not unwelcome for its own sake. The journey would moreover give her (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>)
a peep at Jane; and, in short, as the time drew near, she (<font color='blue'><b>Jane</b></font>) would have
been very sorry for any delay. Everything, however, went on smoothly,
and was finally settled according to Charlotte's first sketch. She (<font color='blue'><b>Charlotte</b></font>) was
to accompany Sir William and his (<font color='blue'><b>William</b></font>) second daughter. The improvement
of spending a night in London was added in time, and the plan became
perfect as plan could be.

<p/>The only pain was in leaving her (<font color='blue'><b>Charlotte</b></font>) father, who would certainly miss her (<font color='blue'><b>Charlotte</b></font>),
and who, when it came to the point, so little liked her (<font color='blue'><b>Charlotte</b></font>) going, that he (<font color='blue'><b>William</b></font>)
told her (<font color='blue'><b>Charlotte</b></font>) to write to him (<font color='blue'><b>William</b></font>), and almost promised to answer her (<font color='blue'><b>Charlotte</b></font>) letter.

<p/>The farewell between herself and Mr. Wickham was perfectly friendly; on
his (<font color='blue'><b>Wickham</b></font>) side even more. His (<font color='blue'><b>Wickham</b></font>) present pursuit could not make him (<font color='blue'><b>Wickham</b></font>) forget that
Elizabeth had been the first to excite and to deserve his (<font color='blue'><b>Wickham</b></font>) attention, the
first to listen and to pity, the first to be admired; and in his (<font color='blue'><b>Wickham</b></font>) manner
of bidding her (<font color='blue'><b>Elizabeth</b></font>) adieu, wishing her (<font color='blue'><b>Elizabeth</b></font>) every enjoyment, reminding her (<font color='blue'><b>Elizabeth</b></font>) of
what she (<font color='blue'><b>Elizabeth</b></font>) was to expect in Lady Catherine de Bourgh, and trusting their
opinion of her (<font color='blue'><b>Bourgh</b></font>)--their opinion of everybody--would always coincide, there
was a solicitude, an interest which she (<font color='blue'><b>Bourgh</b></font>) felt must ever attach her (<font color='blue'><b>Bourgh</b></font>) to
him (<font color='blue'><b>Wickham</b></font>) with a most sincere regard; and she (<font color='blue'><b>Bourgh</b></font>) parted from him (<font color='blue'><b>Wickham</b></font>) convinced that,
whether married or single, he (<font color='blue'><b>Wickham</b></font>) must always be her (<font color='blue'><b>Bourgh</b></font>) model of the amiable
and pleasing.

<p/>Her (<font color='blue'><b>Bourgh</b></font>) fellow-travellers the next day were not of a kind to make her (<font color='blue'><b>Bourgh</b></font>)
think him (<font color='blue'><b>Wickham</b></font>) less agreeable. Sir William Lucas, and his (<font color='blue'><b>Lucas</b></font>) daughter Maria, a
good-humoured girl, but as empty-headed as himself, had nothing to say
that could be worth hearing, and were listened to with about as much
delight as the rattle of the chaise. Elizabeth loved absurdities, but
she (<font color='blue'><b>Elizabeth</b></font>) had known Sir William's too long. He (<font color='blue'><b>William</b></font>) could tell her (<font color='blue'><b>Elizabeth</b></font>) nothing new of
the wonders of his (<font color='blue'><b>William</b></font>) presentation and knighthood; and his (<font color='blue'><b>William</b></font>) civilities were
worn out, like his (<font color='blue'><b>William</b></font>) information.

<p/>It was a journey of only twenty-four miles, and they began it so early
as to be in Gracechurch Street by noon. As they drove to Mr. Gardiner's
door, Jane was at a drawing-room window watching their arrival; when
they entered the passage she (<font color='blue'><b>Jane</b></font>) was there to welcome them, and Elizabeth,
looking earnestly in her (<font color='blue'><b>Elizabeth</b></font>) face, was pleased to see it healthful and
lovely as ever. On the stairs were a troop of little boys and girls,
whose eagerness for their cousin's appearance would not allow them to
wait in the drawing-room, and whose shyness, as they had not seen
her (<font color='blue'><b>Elizabeth</b></font>) for a twelvemonth, prevented their coming lower. All was joy and
kindness. The day passed most pleasantly away; the morning in bustle and
shopping, and the evening at one of the theatres.

<p/>Elizabeth then contrived to sit by her (<font color='blue'><b>Elizabeth</b></font>) aunt. Their first object was her (<font color='blue'><b>Elizabeth</b></font>)
sister; and she (<font color='blue'><b>Elizabeth</b></font>) was more grieved than astonished to hear, in reply to
her (<font color='blue'><b>Elizabeth</b></font>) minute inquiries, that though Jane always struggled to support her (<font color='blue'><b>Jane</b></font>)
spirits, there were periods of dejection. It was reasonable, however,
to hope that they would not continue long. Mrs. Gardiner gave her (<font color='blue'><b>Gardiner</b></font>) the
particulars also of Miss Bingley's visit in Gracechurch Street, and
repeated conversations occurring at different times between Jane and
herself, which proved that the former had, from her (<font color='blue'><b>Jane</b></font>) heart, given up the
acquaintance.

<p/>Mrs. Gardiner then rallied her (<font color='blue'><b>Gardiner</b></font>) niece on Wickham's desertion, and
complimented her (<font color='blue'><b>Gardiner</b></font>) on bearing it so well.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``But my dear Elizabeth,''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Gardiner</b></font>) added, <div class="bookquote">``what sort of girl is Miss King? I
should be sorry to think our friend mercenary.''

 (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Pray, my dear aunt, what is the difference in matrimonial affairs,
between the mercenary and the prudent motive? Where does discretion end,
and avarice begin? Last Christmas you were afraid of his (<font color='blue'><b>friend</b></font>) marrying me,
because it would be imprudent; and now, because he (<font color='blue'><b>friend</b></font>) is trying to get
a girl with only ten thousand pounds, you want to find out that he (<font color='blue'><b>friend</b></font>) is
mercenary.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``If you will only tell me what sort of girl Miss King is, I shall know
what to think.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``She (<font color='blue'><b>King</b></font>) is a very good kind of girl, I believe. I know no harm of her (<font color='blue'><b>King</b></font>).''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``But he (<font color='blue'><b>friend</b></font>) paid her (<font color='blue'><b>King</b></font>) not the smallest attention till her (<font color='blue'><b>King</b></font>) grandfather's death
made her (<font color='blue'><b>King</b></font>) mistress of this fortune.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``No--why should he (<font color='blue'><b>friend</b></font>)? If it were not allowable for him (<font color='blue'><b>friend</b></font>) to gain _my_
affections because I had no money, what occasion could there be for
making love to a girl whom he (<font color='blue'><b>friend</b></font>) did not care about, and who was equally
poor?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``But there seems an indelicacy in directing his (<font color='blue'><b>friend</b></font>) attentions towards her (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>)
so soon after this event.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``A man in distressed circumstances has not time for all those elegant
decorums which other people may observe. If _she (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>)_ does not object to it,
why should _we_?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">''_Her (<font color='blue'><b>Gardiner</b></font>)_ not objecting does not justify _him (<font color='blue'><b>Wickham</b></font>)_. It only shows her (<font color='blue'><b>Gardiner</b></font>) being
deficient in something herself--sense or feeling.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Well,''  (<font color='red'><b>Elizabeth/Miss Bennet/Miss Elizabeth</b></font>)</div>cried Elizabeth, <div class="bookquote">``have it as you choose. _He (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>)_ shall be
mercenary, and _she (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>)_ shall be foolish.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Elizabeth/Miss Bennet/Miss Elizabeth</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``No, Lizzy, that is what I do _not_ choose. I should be sorry, you know,
to think ill of a young man who has lived so long in Derbyshire.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Oh! if that is all, I have a very poor opinion of young men who live in
Derbyshire; and their intimate friends who live in Hertfordshire are not
much better. I am sick of them all. Thank Heaven! I am going to-morrow
where I shall find a man who has not one agreeable quality, who has
neither manner nor sense to recommend him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>). Stupid men are the only ones
worth knowing, after all.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Take care, Lizzy; that speech savours strongly of disappointment.''

 (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div><p/>Before they were separated by the conclusion of the play, she (<font color='blue'><b>Elizabeth</b></font>) had the
unexpected happiness of an invitation to accompany her (<font color='blue'><b>Elizabeth</b></font>) uncle and aunt in
a tour of pleasure which they proposed taking in the summer.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``We have not determined how far it shall carry us,''  (<font color='red'><b>Mrs. Gardiner/Gardiner/GARDINER</b></font>)</div>said Mrs. Gardiner,
<div class="bookquote">``but, perhaps, to the Lakes.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Mrs. Gardiner/Gardiner/GARDINER</b></font>)</div><p/>No scheme could have been more agreeable to Elizabeth, and her (<font color='blue'><b>Elizabeth</b></font>)
acceptance of the invitation was most ready and grateful. <div class="bookquote">``Oh, my dear,
dear aunt,''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Elizabeth</b></font>) rapturously cried, <div class="bookquote">``what delight! what felicity! You
give me fresh life and vigour. Adieu to disappointment and spleen. What
are young men to rocks and mountains? Oh! what hours of transport
we shall spend! And when we _do_ return, it shall not be like other
travellers, without being able to give one accurate idea of anything. We
_will_ know where we have gone--we _will_ recollect what we have seen.
Lakes, mountains, and rivers shall not be jumbled together in our
imaginations; nor when we attempt to describe any particular scene,
will we begin quarreling about its relative situation. Let _our_
first effusions be less insupportable than those of the generality of
travellers.''



 (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div><p/>Chapter 28


<p/>Every object in the next day's journey was new and interesting to
Elizabeth; and her (<font color='blue'><b>Elizabeth</b></font>) spirits were in a state of enjoyment; for she (<font color='blue'><b>Elizabeth</b></font>) had
seen her (<font color='blue'><b>Elizabeth</b></font>) sister looking so well as to banish all fear for her (<font color='blue'><b>Elizabeth</b></font>) health,
and the prospect of her (<font color='blue'><b>Elizabeth</b></font>) northern tour was a constant source of delight.

<p/>When they left the high road for the lane to Hunsford, every eye was in
search of the Parsonage, and every turning expected to bring it in view.
The palings of Rosings Park was their boundary on one side. Elizabeth
smiled at the recollection of all that she (<font color='blue'><b>Elizabeth</b></font>) had heard of its inhabitants.

<p/>At length the Parsonage was discernible. The garden sloping to the
road, the house standing in it, the green pales, and the laurel hedge,
everything declared they were arriving. Mr. Collins and Charlotte
appeared at the door, and the carriage stopped at the small gate which
led by a short gravel walk to the house, amidst the nods and smiles of
the whole party. In a moment they were all out of the chaise, rejoicing
at the sight of each other. Mrs. Collins welcomed her (<font color='blue'><b>Collins</b></font>) friend with the
liveliest pleasure, and Elizabeth was more and more satisfied with
coming when she (<font color='blue'><b>Elizabeth</b></font>) found herself so affectionately received. She (<font color='blue'><b>Elizabeth</b></font>) saw
instantly that her (<font color='blue'><b>Elizabeth</b></font>) cousin's manners were not altered by his (<font color='blue'><b>cousin</b></font>) marriage;
his (<font color='blue'><b>cousin</b></font>) formal civility was just what it had been, and he (<font color='blue'><b>cousin</b></font>) detained her (<font color='blue'><b>Elizabeth</b></font>) some
minutes at the gate to hear and satisfy his (<font color='blue'><b>cousin</b></font>) inquiries after all her (<font color='blue'><b>Elizabeth</b></font>)
family. They were then, with no other delay than his (<font color='blue'><b>cousin</b></font>) pointing out the
neatness of the entrance, taken into the house; and as soon as they
were in the parlour, he (<font color='blue'><b>cousin</b></font>) welcomed them a second time, with ostentatious
formality to his (<font color='blue'><b>cousin</b></font>) humble abode, and punctually repeated all his (<font color='blue'><b>cousin</b></font>) wife's
offers of refreshment.

<p/>Elizabeth was prepared to see him (<font color='blue'><b>cousin</b></font>) in his (<font color='blue'><b>cousin</b></font>) glory; and she (<font color='blue'><b>Elizabeth</b></font>) could not help
in fancying that in displaying the good proportion of the room, its
aspect and its furniture, he (<font color='blue'><b>cousin</b></font>) addressed himself particularly to her (<font color='blue'><b>Elizabeth</b></font>),
as if wishing to make her (<font color='blue'><b>Elizabeth</b></font>) feel what she (<font color='blue'><b>Elizabeth</b></font>) had lost in refusing him (<font color='blue'><b>cousin</b></font>). But
though everything seemed neat and comfortable, she (<font color='blue'><b>Elizabeth</b></font>) was not able to
gratify him (<font color='blue'><b>cousin</b></font>) by any sigh of repentance, and rather looked with wonder at
her (<font color='blue'><b>Elizabeth</b></font>) friend that she (<font color='blue'><b>Elizabeth</b></font>) could have so cheerful an air with such a companion.
When Mr. Collins said anything of which his (<font color='blue'><b>Collins</b></font>) wife might reasonably be
ashamed, which certainly was not unseldom, she (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>) involuntarily turned her (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>)
eye on Charlotte. Once or twice she (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>) could discern a faint blush; but
in general Charlotte wisely did not hear. After sitting long enough to
admire every article of furniture in the room, from the sideboard to
the fender, to give an account of their journey, and of all that had
happened in London, Mr. Collins invited them to take a stroll in the
garden, which was large and well laid out, and to the cultivation of
which he (<font color='blue'><b>Collins</b></font>) attended himself. To work in this garden was one of his (<font color='blue'><b>Collins</b></font>) most
respectable pleasures; and Elizabeth admired the command of countenance
with which Charlotte talked of the healthfulness of the exercise, and
owned she (<font color='blue'><b>Charlotte</b></font>) encouraged it as much as possible. Here, leading the way
through every walk and cross walk, and scarcely allowing them an
interval to utter the praises he (<font color='blue'><b>Collins</b></font>) asked for, every view was pointed out
with a minuteness which left beauty entirely behind. He (<font color='blue'><b>Collins</b></font>) could number the
fields in every direction, and could tell how many trees there were in
the most distant clump. But of all the views which his (<font color='blue'><b>Collins</b></font>) garden, or which
the country or kingdom could boast, none were to be compared with the
prospect of Rosings, afforded by an opening in the trees that bordered
the park nearly opposite the front of his (<font color='blue'><b>Collins</b></font>) house. It was a handsome
modern building, well situated on rising ground.

<p/>From his (<font color='blue'><b>Collins</b></font>) garden, Mr. Collins would have led them round his (<font color='blue'><b>Collins</b></font>) two meadows;
but the ladies, not having shoes to encounter the remains of a white
frost, turned back; and while Sir William accompanied him (<font color='blue'><b>William</b></font>), Charlotte
took her (<font color='blue'><b>Charlotte</b></font>) sister and friend over the house, extremely well pleased,
probably, to have the opportunity of showing it without her (<font color='blue'><b>Charlotte</b></font>) husband's
help. It was rather small, but well built and convenient; and everything
was fitted up and arranged with a neatness and consistency of which
Elizabeth gave Charlotte all the credit. When Mr. Collins could be
forgotten, there was really an air of great comfort throughout, and by
Charlotte's evident enjoyment of it, Elizabeth supposed he (<font color='blue'><b>Collins</b></font>) must be often
forgotten.

<p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>Elizabeth</b></font>) had already learnt that Lady Catherine was still in the country. It
was spoken of again while they were at dinner, when Mr. Collins joining
in, observed:

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Yes, Miss Elizabeth, you will have the honour of seeing Lady Catherine
de Bourgh on the ensuing Sunday at church, and I need not say you will
be delighted with her (<font color='blue'><b>Bourgh</b></font>). She (<font color='blue'><b>Bourgh</b></font>) is all affability and condescension, and I
doubt not but you will be honoured with some portion of her (<font color='blue'><b>Bourgh</b></font>) notice
when service is over. I have scarcely any hesitation in saying she (<font color='blue'><b>Bourgh</b></font>)
will include you and my sister Maria in every invitation with which she (<font color='blue'><b>Maria</b></font>)
honours us during your stay here. Her (<font color='blue'><b>Maria</b></font>) behaviour to my dear Charlotte is
charming. We dine at Rosings twice every week, and are never allowed
to walk home. Her (<font color='blue'><b>Charlotte</b></font>) ladyship's carriage is regularly ordered for us. I
_should_ say, one of her (<font color='blue'><b>Charlotte</b></font>) ladyship's carriages, for she (<font color='blue'><b>Charlotte</b></font>) has several.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Collins</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Lady Catherine is a very respectable, sensible woman indeed,''  (<font color='red'><b>Charlotte</b></font>)</div>added
Charlotte, <div class="bookquote">``and a most attentive neighbour.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Charlotte</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Very true, my dear, that is exactly what I say. She (<font color='blue'><b>Catherine</b></font>) is the sort of
woman whom one cannot regard with too much deference.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/>The evening was spent chiefly in talking over Hertfordshire news,
and telling again what had already been written; and when it closed,
Elizabeth, in the solitude of her (<font color='blue'><b>Elizabeth</b></font>) chamber, had to meditate upon
Charlotte's degree of contentment, to understand her (<font color='blue'><b>Charlotte</b></font>) address in guiding,
and composure in bearing with, her (<font color='blue'><b>Charlotte</b></font>) husband, and to acknowledge that it
was all done very well. She (<font color='blue'><b>Charlotte</b></font>) had also to anticipate how her (<font color='blue'><b>Charlotte</b></font>) visit
would pass, the quiet tenor of their usual employments, the vexatious
interruptions of Mr. Collins, and the gaieties of their intercourse with
Rosings. A lively imagination soon settled it all.

<p/>About the middle of the next day, as she (<font color='blue'><b>Charlotte</b></font>) was in her (<font color='blue'><b>Charlotte</b></font>) room getting ready
for a walk, a sudden noise below seemed to speak the whole house in
confusion; and, after listening a moment, she (<font color='blue'><b>Charlotte</b></font>) heard somebody running
up stairs in a violent hurry, and calling loudly after her (<font color='blue'><b>Charlotte</b></font>). She (<font color='blue'><b>Charlotte</b></font>) opened
the door and met Maria in the landing place, who, breathless with
agitation, cried out--

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Oh, my dear Eliza! pray make haste and come into the dining-room, for
there is such a sight to be seen! I will not tell you what it is. Make
haste, and come down this moment.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Maria/Maria Lucas</b></font>)</div><p/>Elizabeth asked questions in vain; Maria would tell her (<font color='blue'><b>Maria</b></font>) nothing more,
and down they ran into the dining-room, which fronted the lane, in
quest of this wonder; It was two ladies stopping in a low phaeton at the
garden gate.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``And is this all?''  (<font color='red'><b>Elizabeth/Miss Bennet/Miss Elizabeth</b></font>)</div>cried Elizabeth. <div class="bookquote">``I expected at least that the pigs
were got into the garden, and here is nothing but Lady Catherine and her (<font color='blue'><b>Catherine</b></font>)
daughter.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``La! my dear,''  (<font color='red'><b>Maria/Maria Lucas</b></font>)</div>said Maria, quite shocked at the mistake, <div class="bookquote">``it is not
Lady Catherine. The old lady is Mrs. Jenkinson, who lives with them;
the other is Miss de Bourgh. Only look at her (<font color='blue'><b>Jenkinson</b></font>). She (<font color='blue'><b>Jenkinson</b></font>) is quite a little
creature. Who would have thought that she (<font color='blue'><b>Jenkinson</b></font>) could be so thin and small?''

 (<font color='red'><b>Maria/Maria Lucas</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``She (<font color='blue'><b>Jenkinson</b></font>) is abominably rude to keep Charlotte out of doors in all this wind.
Why does she (<font color='blue'><b>Charlotte</b></font>) not come in?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Oh, Charlotte says she (<font color='blue'><b>Charlotte</b></font>) hardly ever does. It is the greatest of favours
when Miss de Bourgh comes in.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I like her (<font color='blue'><b>Charlotte</b></font>) appearance,''  (<font color='red'><b>Elizabeth/Miss Bennet/Miss Elizabeth</b></font>)</div>said Elizabeth, struck with other ideas. <div class="bookquote">``She (<font color='blue'><b>Charlotte</b></font>)
looks sickly and cross. Yes, she (<font color='blue'><b>Charlotte</b></font>) will do for him (<font color='blue'><b>Jenkinson</b></font>) very well. She (<font color='blue'><b>Charlotte</b></font>) will
make him (<font color='blue'><b>Jenkinson</b></font>) a very proper wife.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Collins</b></font>)</div><p/>Mr. Collins and Charlotte were both standing at the gate in conversation
with the ladies; and Sir William, to Elizabeth's high diversion, was
stationed in the doorway, in earnest contemplation of the greatness
before him (<font color='blue'><b>William</b></font>), and constantly bowing whenever Miss de Bourgh looked that
way.

<p/>At length there was nothing more to be said; the ladies drove on, and
the others returned into the house. Mr. Collins no sooner saw the two
girls than he (<font color='blue'><b>Collins</b></font>) began to congratulate them on their good fortune, which
Charlotte explained by letting them know that the whole party was asked
to dine at Rosings the next day.



<p/>Chapter 29


<p/>Mr. Collins's triumph, in consequence of this invitation, was complete.
The power of displaying the grandeur of his (<font color='blue'><b>Collins</b></font>) patroness to his (<font color='blue'><b>Collins</b></font>) wondering
visitors, and of letting them see her (<font color='blue'><b>Charlotte</b></font>) civility towards himself and his (<font color='blue'><b>Collins</b></font>)
wife, was exactly what he (<font color='blue'><b>Collins</b></font>) had wished for; and that an opportunity
of doing it should be given so soon, was such an instance of Lady
Catherine's condescension, as he (<font color='blue'><b>Collins</b></font>) knew not how to admire enough.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``I confess,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>said he (<font color='blue'><b>Collins</b></font>), <div class="bookquote">``that I should not have been at all surprised by
her (<font color='blue'><b>Charlotte</b></font>) ladyship's asking us on Sunday to drink tea and spend the evening at
Rosings. I rather expected, from my knowledge of her (<font color='blue'><b>Charlotte</b></font>) affability, that it
would happen. But who could have foreseen such an attention as this? Who
could have imagined that we should receive an invitation to dine there
-LRB-an invitation, moreover, including the whole party-RRB- so immediately
after your arrival!''

 (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I am the less surprised at what has happened,''  (<font color='red'><b>William/William Lucas</b></font>)</div>replied Sir William,
<div class="bookquote">``from that knowledge of what the manners of the great really are, which
my situation in life has allowed me to acquire. About the court, such
instances of elegant breeding are not uncommon.''

 (<font color='red'><b>William/William Lucas</b></font>)</div><p/>Scarcely anything was talked of the whole day or next morning but their
visit to Rosings. Mr. Collins was carefully instructing them in what
they were to expect, that the sight of such rooms, so many servants, and
so splendid a dinner, might not wholly overpower them.

<p/>When the ladies were separating for the toilette, he (<font color='blue'><b>Collins</b></font>) said to Elizabeth--

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Do not make yourself uneasy, my dear cousin, about your apparel. Lady
Catherine is far from requiring that elegance of dress in us which
becomes herself and her (<font color='blue'><b>Catherine</b></font>) daughter. I would advise you merely to put on
whatever of your clothes is superior to the rest--there is no occasion
for anything more. Lady Catherine will not think the worse of you
for being simply dressed. She (<font color='blue'><b>Catherine</b></font>) likes to have the distinction of rank
preserved.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Elizabeth/Miss Bennet/Miss Elizabeth</b></font>)</div><p/>While they were dressing, he (<font color='blue'><b>Collins</b></font>) came two or three times to their different
doors, to recommend their being quick, as Lady Catherine very much
objected to be kept waiting for her (<font color='blue'><b>Catherine</b></font>) dinner. Such formidable accounts of
her (<font color='blue'><b>Catherine</b></font>) ladyship, and her (<font color='blue'><b>Catherine</b></font>) manner of living, quite frightened Maria Lucas
who had been little used to company, and she (<font color='blue'><b>Lucas</b></font>) looked forward to her (<font color='blue'><b>Lucas</b></font>)
introduction at Rosings with as much apprehension as her (<font color='blue'><b>Lucas</b></font>) father had done
to his (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) presentation at St. James's.

<p/>As the weather was fine, they had a pleasant walk of about half a
mile across the park. Every park has its beauty and its prospects; and
Elizabeth saw much to be pleased with, though she (<font color='blue'><b>Elizabeth</b></font>) could not be in such
raptures as Mr. Collins expected the scene to inspire, and was but
slightly affected by his (<font color='blue'><b>Collins</b></font>) enumeration of the windows in front of the
house, and his (<font color='blue'><b>Collins</b></font>) relation of what the glazing altogether had originally
cost Sir Lewis de Bourgh.

<p/>When they ascended the steps to the hall, Maria's alarm was every
moment increasing, and even Sir William did not look perfectly calm.
Elizabeth's courage did not fail her (<font color='blue'><b>Elizabeth</b></font>). She (<font color='blue'><b>Elizabeth</b></font>) had heard nothing of Lady
Catherine that spoke her (<font color='blue'><b>Catherine</b></font>) awful from any extraordinary talents or
miraculous virtue, and the mere stateliness of money or rank she (<font color='blue'><b>Catherine</b></font>) thought
she (<font color='blue'><b>Catherine</b></font>) could witness without trepidation.

<p/>From the entrance-hall, of which Mr. Collins pointed out, with a
rapturous air, the fine proportion and the finished ornaments, they
followed the servants through an ante-chamber, to the room where Lady
Catherine, her (<font color='blue'><b>Catherine</b></font>) daughter, and Mrs. Jenkinson were sitting. Her (<font color='blue'><b>Catherine</b></font>) ladyship,
with great condescension, arose to receive them; and as Mrs. Collins had
settled it with her (<font color='blue'><b>Collins</b></font>) husband that the office of introduction should
be hers, it was performed in a proper manner, without any of those
apologies and thanks which he (<font color='blue'><b>husband</b></font>) would have thought necessary.

<p/>In spite of having been at St. James's, Sir William was so completely
awed by the grandeur surrounding him (<font color='blue'><b>William</b></font>), that he (<font color='blue'><b>William</b></font>) had but just courage
enough to make a very low bow, and take his (<font color='blue'><b>William</b></font>) seat without saying a word;
and his (<font color='blue'><b>William</b></font>) daughter, frightened almost out of her (<font color='blue'><b>daughter</b></font>) senses, sat on the edge
of her (<font color='blue'><b>daughter</b></font>) chair, not knowing which way to look. Elizabeth found herself
quite equal to the scene, and could observe the three ladies before her (<font color='blue'><b>Elizabeth</b></font>)
composedly. Lady Catherine was a tall, large woman, with strongly-marked
features, which might once have been handsome. Her (<font color='blue'><b>Catherine</b></font>) air was not
conciliating, nor was her (<font color='blue'><b>Catherine</b></font>) manner of receiving them such as to make her (<font color='blue'><b>Catherine</b></font>)
visitors forget their inferior rank. She (<font color='blue'><b>Catherine</b></font>) was not rendered formidable by
silence; but whatever she (<font color='blue'><b>Catherine</b></font>) said was spoken in so authoritative a tone,
as marked her (<font color='blue'><b>Catherine</b></font>) self-importance, and brought Mr. Wickham immediately to
Elizabeth's mind; and from the observation of the day altogether, she (<font color='blue'><b>Elizabeth</b></font>)
believed Lady Catherine to be exactly what he (<font color='blue'><b>Wickham</b></font>) represented.

<p/>When, after examining the mother, in whose countenance and deportment
she (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) soon found some resemblance of Mr. Darcy, she (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) turned her (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) eyes on the
daughter, she (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) could almost have joined in Maria's astonishment at her (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>)
being so thin and so small. There was neither in figure nor face any
likeness between the ladies. Miss de Bourgh was pale and sickly; her (<font color='blue'><b>Bourgh</b></font>)
features, though not plain, were insignificant; and she (<font color='blue'><b>Bourgh</b></font>) spoke very
little, except in a low voice, to Mrs. Jenkinson, in whose appearance
there was nothing remarkable, and who was entirely engaged in listening
to what she (<font color='blue'><b>Jenkinson</b></font>) said, and placing a screen in the proper direction before
her (<font color='blue'><b>Jenkinson</b></font>) eyes.

<p/>After sitting a few minutes, they were all sent to one of the windows to
admire the view, Mr. Collins attending them to point out its beauties,
and Lady Catherine kindly informing them that it was much better worth
looking at in the summer.

<p/>The dinner was exceedingly handsome, and there were all the servants and
all the articles of plate which Mr. Collins had promised; and, as he (<font color='blue'><b>Collins</b></font>) had
likewise foretold, he (<font color='blue'><b>Collins</b></font>) took his (<font color='blue'><b>Collins</b></font>) seat at the bottom of the table, by her (<font color='blue'><b>Catherine</b></font>)
ladyship's desire, and looked as if he (<font color='blue'><b>Collins</b></font>) felt that life could furnish
nothing greater. He (<font color='blue'><b>Collins</b></font>) carved, and ate, and praised with delighted
alacrity; and every dish was commended, first by him (<font color='blue'><b>Collins</b></font>) and then by Sir
William, who was now enough recovered to echo whatever his (<font color='blue'><b>William</b></font>) son-in-law
said, in a manner which Elizabeth wondered Lady Catherine could bear.
But Lady Catherine seemed gratified by their excessive admiration, and
gave most gracious smiles, especially when any dish on the table proved
a novelty to them. The party did not supply much conversation. Elizabeth
was ready to speak whenever there was an opening, but she (<font color='blue'><b>Elizabeth</b></font>) was seated
between Charlotte and Miss de Bourgh--the former of whom was engaged in
listening to Lady Catherine, and the latter said not a word to her (<font color='blue'><b>Catherine</b></font>) all
dinner-time. Mrs. Jenkinson was chiefly employed in watching how little
Miss de Bourgh ate, pressing her (<font color='blue'><b>Jenkinson</b></font>) to try some other dish, and fearing
she (<font color='blue'><b>Jenkinson</b></font>) was indisposed. Maria thought speaking out of the question, and the
gentlemen did nothing but eat and admire.

<p/>When the ladies returned to the drawing-room, there was little to
be done but to hear Lady Catherine talk, which she (<font color='blue'><b>Catherine</b></font>) did without any
intermission till coffee came in, delivering her (<font color='blue'><b>Catherine</b></font>) opinion on every
subject in so decisive a manner, as proved that she (<font color='blue'><b>Catherine</b></font>) was not used to
have her (<font color='blue'><b>Catherine</b></font>) judgement controverted. She (<font color='blue'><b>Catherine</b></font>) inquired into Charlotte's domestic
concerns familiarly and minutely, gave her (<font color='blue'><b>Catherine</b></font>) a great deal of advice as
to the management of them all; told her (<font color='blue'><b>Catherine</b></font>) how everything ought to be
regulated in so small a family as hers, and instructed her (<font color='blue'><b>Catherine</b></font>) as to the
care of her (<font color='blue'><b>Catherine</b></font>) cows and her (<font color='blue'><b>Catherine</b></font>) poultry. Elizabeth found that nothing was
beneath this great lady's attention, which could furnish her (<font color='blue'><b>Elizabeth</b></font>) with an
occasion of dictating to others. In the intervals of her (<font color='blue'><b>Elizabeth</b></font>) discourse
with Mrs. Collins, she (<font color='blue'><b>Elizabeth</b></font>) addressed a variety of questions to Maria and
Elizabeth, but especially to the latter, of whose connections she (<font color='blue'><b>Elizabeth</b></font>) knew
the least, and who she (<font color='blue'><b>Elizabeth</b></font>) observed to Mrs. Collins was a very genteel,
pretty kind of girl. She (<font color='blue'><b>Collins</b></font>) asked her (<font color='blue'><b>Collins</b></font>), at different times, how many sisters
she (<font color='blue'><b>Collins</b></font>) had, whether they were older or younger than herself, whether any of
them were likely to be married, whether they were handsome, where they
had been educated, what carriage her (<font color='blue'><b>Collins</b></font>) father kept, and what had been
her (<font color='blue'><b>Collins</b></font>) mother's maiden name? Elizabeth felt all the impertinence of
her (<font color='blue'><b>Elizabeth</b></font>) questions but answered them very composedly. Lady Catherine then
observed,

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Your father's estate is entailed on Mr. Collins, I think. For your
sake,''  (<font color='red'><b>Lady Catherine/Lady Catherine de Bourgh/Catherine</b></font>)</div>turning to Charlotte, <div class="bookquote">``I am glad of it; but otherwise I see no
occasion for entailing estates from the female line. It was not thought
necessary in Sir Lewis de Bourgh's family. Do you play and sing, Miss
Bennet?''

 (<font color='red'><b>Charlotte</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``A little.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Oh! then--some time or other we shall be happy to hear you. Our
instrument is a capital one, probably superior to--You shall try it
some day. Do your sisters play and sing?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``One of them does.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Why did not you all learn? You ought all to have learned. The Miss
Webbs all play, and their father has not so good an income as yours. Do
you draw?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``No, not at all.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``What, none of you?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Not one.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``That is very strange. But I suppose you had no opportunity. Your mother
should have taken you to town every spring for the benefit of masters.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``My mother would have had no objection, but my father hates London.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Has your governess left you?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``We never had any governess.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``No governess! How was that possible? Five daughters brought up at home
without a governess! I never heard of such a thing. Your mother must
have been quite a slave to your education.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Elizabeth/Miss Bennet/Miss Elizabeth</b></font>)</div><p/>Elizabeth could hardly help smiling as she (<font color='blue'><b>Elizabeth</b></font>) assured her (<font color='blue'><b>Elizabeth</b></font>) that had not been
the case.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Then, who taught you? who attended to you? Without a governess, you
must have been neglected.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Compared with some families, I believe we were; but such of us as
wished to learn never wanted the means. We were always encouraged to
read, and had all the masters that were necessary. Those who chose to be
idle, certainly might.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/>``Aye, no doubt; but that is what a governess will prevent, and if I had
known your mother, I should have advised her (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) most strenuously to engage
one. I always say that nothing is to be done in education without steady
and regular instruction, and nobody but a governess can give it. It is
wonderful how many families I have been the means of supplying in that
way. I am always glad to get a young person well placed out. Four nieces
of Mrs. Jenkinson are most delightfully situated through my means; and
it was but the other day that I recommended another young person,
who was merely accidentally mentioned to me, and the family are quite
delighted with her (<font color='blue'><b>Jenkinson</b></font>). Mrs. Collins, did I tell you of Lady Metcalf's
calling yesterday to thank me? She (<font color='blue'><b>Metcalf</b></font>) finds Miss Pope a treasure. ``Lady
Catherine,<div class="bookquote">'' said she (<font color='blue'><b>Elizabeth</b></font>), `you have given me a treasure.''  (<font color='red'><b>Lady Catherine/Lady Catherine de Bourgh/Catherine</b></font>)</div>Are any of your
younger sisters out, Miss Bennet?''

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Yes, ma'am, all.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``All! What, all five out at once? Very odd! And you only the second. The
younger ones out before the elder ones are married! Your younger sisters
must be very young?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Yes, my youngest is not sixteen. Perhaps _she (<font color='blue'><b>Catherine</b></font>)_ is full young to be
much in company. But really, ma'am, I think it would be very hard upon
younger sisters, that they should not have their share of society and
amusement, because the elder may not have the means or inclination to
marry early. The last-born has as good a right to the pleasures of youth
as the first. And to be kept back on _such_ a motive! I think it would
not be very likely to promote sisterly affection or delicacy of mind.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Upon my word,''  (<font color='red'><b>ladyship</b></font>)</div>said her (<font color='blue'><b>Bennet</b></font>) ladyship, <div class="bookquote">``you give your opinion very decidedly
for so young a person. Pray, what is your age?''

 (<font color='red'><b>ladyship</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``With three younger sisters grown up,''  (<font color='red'><b>Elizabeth/Miss Bennet/Miss Elizabeth</b></font>)</div>replied Elizabeth, smiling, <div class="bookquote">``your
ladyship can hardly expect me to own it.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Elizabeth/Miss Bennet/Miss Elizabeth</b></font>)</div><p/>Lady Catherine seemed quite astonished at not receiving a direct answer;
and Elizabeth suspected herself to be the first creature who had ever
dared to trifle with so much dignified impertinence.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``You cannot be more than twenty, I am sure, therefore you need not
conceal your age.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I am not one-and-twenty.''

 (<font color='red'><b>the gentlemen</b></font>)</div><p/>When the gentlemen had joined them, and tea was over, the card-tables
were placed. Lady Catherine, Sir William, and Mr. and Mrs. Collins sat
down to quadrille; and as Miss de Bourgh chose to play at cassino, the
two girls had the honour of assisting Mrs. Jenkinson to make up her (<font color='blue'><b>Jenkinson</b></font>)
party. Their table was superlatively stupid. Scarcely a syllable was
uttered that did not relate to the game, except when Mrs. Jenkinson
expressed her (<font color='blue'><b>Jenkinson</b></font>) fears of Miss de Bourgh's being too hot or too cold, or
having too much or too little light. A great deal more passed at the
other table. Lady Catherine was generally speaking--stating the mistakes
of the three others, or relating some anecdote of herself. Mr. Collins
was employed in agreeing to everything her (<font color='blue'><b>Catherine</b></font>) ladyship said, thanking her (<font color='blue'><b>Catherine</b></font>)
for every fish he (<font color='blue'><b>Collins</b></font>) won, and apologising if he (<font color='blue'><b>Collins</b></font>) thought he (<font color='blue'><b>Collins</b></font>) won too many.
Sir William did not say much. He (<font color='blue'><b>William</b></font>) was storing his (<font color='blue'><b>William</b></font>) memory with anecdotes
and noble names.

<p/>When Lady Catherine and her (<font color='blue'><b>Catherine</b></font>) daughter had played as long as they chose,
the tables were broken up, the carriage was offered to Mrs. Collins,
gratefully accepted and immediately ordered. The party then gathered
round the fire to hear Lady Catherine determine what weather they were
to have on the morrow. From these instructions they were summoned by
the arrival of the coach; and with many speeches of thankfulness on Mr.
Collins's side and as many bows on Sir William's they departed. As soon
as they had driven from the door, Elizabeth was called on by her (<font color='blue'><b>Elizabeth</b></font>) cousin
to give her (<font color='blue'><b>Elizabeth</b></font>) opinion of all that she (<font color='blue'><b>Elizabeth</b></font>) had seen at Rosings, which, for
Charlotte's sake, she (<font color='blue'><b>Charlotte</b></font>) made more favourable than it really was. But her (<font color='blue'><b>Charlotte</b></font>)
commendation, though costing her (<font color='blue'><b>Charlotte</b></font>) some trouble, could by no means satisfy
Mr. Collins, and he (<font color='blue'><b>Collins</b></font>) was very soon obliged to take her (<font color='blue'><b>Charlotte</b></font>) ladyship's praise
into his (<font color='blue'><b>Collins</b></font>) own hands.



<p/>Chapter 30


<p/>Sir William stayed only a week at Hunsford, but his (<font color='blue'><b>William</b></font>) visit was long
enough to convince him (<font color='blue'><b>William</b></font>) of his (<font color='blue'><b>William</b></font>) daughter's being most comfortably settled,
and of her (<font color='blue'><b>daughter</b></font>) possessing such a husband and such a neighbour as were not
often met with. While Sir William was with them, Mr. Collins devoted his (<font color='blue'><b>Collins</b></font>)
morning to driving him (<font color='blue'><b>Collins</b></font>) out in his (<font color='blue'><b>Collins</b></font>) gig, and showing him (<font color='blue'><b>Collins</b></font>) the country; but
when he (<font color='blue'><b>Collins</b></font>) went away, the whole family returned to their usual employments,
and Elizabeth was thankful to find that they did not see more of her (<font color='blue'><b>Elizabeth</b></font>)
cousin by the alteration, for the chief of the time between breakfast
and dinner was now passed by him (<font color='blue'><b>chief</b></font>) either at work in the garden or in
reading and writing, and looking out of the window in his (<font color='blue'><b>chief</b></font>) own book-room,
which fronted the road. The room in which the ladies sat was backwards.
Elizabeth had at first rather wondered that Charlotte should not prefer
the dining-parlour for common use; it was a better sized room, and had a
more pleasant aspect; but she (<font color='blue'><b>Charlotte</b></font>) soon saw that her (<font color='blue'><b>Charlotte</b></font>) friend had an excellent
reason for what she (<font color='blue'><b>Charlotte</b></font>) did, for Mr. Collins would undoubtedly have been
much less in his (<font color='blue'><b>Collins</b></font>) own apartment, had they sat in one equally lively; and
she (<font color='blue'><b>Charlotte</b></font>) gave Charlotte credit for the arrangement.

<p/>From the drawing-room they could distinguish nothing in the lane, and
were indebted to Mr. Collins for the knowledge of what carriages went
along, and how often especially Miss de Bourgh drove by in her (<font color='blue'><b>Charlotte</b></font>) phaeton,
which he (<font color='blue'><b>Collins</b></font>) never failed coming to inform them of, though it happened
almost every day. She (<font color='blue'><b>Charlotte</b></font>) not unfrequently stopped at the Parsonage, and
had a few minutes' conversation with Charlotte, but was scarcely ever
prevailed upon to get out.

<p/>Very few days passed in which Mr. Collins did not walk to Rosings, and
not many in which his (<font color='blue'><b>Collins</b></font>) wife did not think it necessary to go likewise;
and till Elizabeth recollected that there might be other family livings
to be disposed of, she (<font color='blue'><b>Elizabeth</b></font>) could not understand the sacrifice of so many
hours. Now and then they were honoured with a call from her (<font color='blue'><b>Elizabeth</b></font>) ladyship,
and nothing escaped her (<font color='blue'><b>Elizabeth</b></font>) observation that was passing in the room during
these visits. She (<font color='blue'><b>Elizabeth</b></font>) examined into their employments, looked at their work,
and advised them to do it differently; found fault with the arrangement
of the furniture; or detected the housemaid in negligence; and if she (<font color='blue'><b>housemaid</b></font>)
accepted any refreshment, seemed to do it only for the sake of finding
out that Mrs. Collins's joints of meat were too large for her (<font color='blue'><b>Collins</b></font>) family.

<p/>Elizabeth soon perceived, that though this great lady was not in
commission of the peace of the county, she (<font color='blue'><b>Elizabeth</b></font>) was a most active magistrate
in her (<font color='blue'><b>Elizabeth</b></font>) own parish, the minutest concerns of which were carried to her (<font color='blue'><b>Elizabeth</b></font>)
by Mr. Collins; and whenever any of the cottagers were disposed to
be quarrelsome, discontented, or too poor, she (<font color='blue'><b>Elizabeth</b></font>) sallied forth into the
village to settle their differences, silence their complaints, and scold
them into harmony and plenty.

<p/>The entertainment of dining at Rosings was repeated about twice a week;
and, allowing for the loss of Sir William, and there being only one
card-table in the evening, every such entertainment was the counterpart
of the first. Their other engagements were few, as the style of living
in the neighbourhood in general was beyond Mr. Collins's reach. This,
however, was no evil to Elizabeth, and upon the whole she (<font color='blue'><b>Elizabeth</b></font>) spent her (<font color='blue'><b>Elizabeth</b></font>) time
comfortably enough; there were half-hours of pleasant conversation with
Charlotte, and the weather was so fine for the time of year that she (<font color='blue'><b>Charlotte</b></font>) had
often great enjoyment out of doors. Her (<font color='blue'><b>Charlotte</b></font>) favourite walk, and where she (<font color='blue'><b>Charlotte</b></font>)
frequently went while the others were calling on Lady Catherine, was
along the open grove which edged that side of the park, where there was
a nice sheltered path, which no one seemed to value but herself, and
where she (<font color='blue'><b>Catherine</b></font>) felt beyond the reach of Lady Catherine's curiosity.

<p/>In this quiet way, the first fortnight of her (<font color='blue'><b>Catherine</b></font>) visit soon passed away.
Easter was approaching, and the week preceding it was to bring an
addition to the family at Rosings, which in so small a circle must be
important. Elizabeth had heard soon after her (<font color='blue'><b>Elizabeth</b></font>) arrival that Mr. Darcy was
expected there in the course of a few weeks, and though there were not
many of her (<font color='blue'><b>Elizabeth</b></font>) acquaintances whom she (<font color='blue'><b>Elizabeth</b></font>) did not prefer, his (<font color='blue'><b>Darcy</b></font>) coming would
furnish one comparatively new to look at in their Rosings parties, and
she (<font color='blue'><b>Elizabeth</b></font>) might be amused in seeing how hopeless Miss Bingley's designs on him (<font color='blue'><b>Darcy</b></font>)
were, by his (<font color='blue'><b>Darcy</b></font>) behaviour to his (<font color='blue'><b>Darcy</b></font>) cousin, for whom he (<font color='blue'><b>Darcy</b></font>) was evidently
destined by Lady Catherine, who talked of his (<font color='blue'><b>Darcy</b></font>) coming with the greatest
satisfaction, spoke of him (<font color='blue'><b>Darcy</b></font>) in terms of the highest admiration, and
seemed almost angry to find that he (<font color='blue'><b>Darcy</b></font>) had already been frequently seen by
Miss Lucas and herself.

<p/>His (<font color='blue'><b>Darcy</b></font>) arrival was soon known at the Parsonage; for Mr. Collins was walking
the whole morning within view of the lodges opening into Hunsford Lane,
in order to have the earliest assurance of it, and after making his (<font color='blue'><b>Collins</b></font>)
bow as the carriage turned into the Park, hurried home with the great
intelligence. On the following morning he (<font color='blue'><b>Collins</b></font>) hastened to Rosings to pay his (<font color='blue'><b>Collins</b></font>)
respects. There were two nephews of Lady Catherine to require them, for
Mr. Darcy had brought with him (<font color='blue'><b>Darcy</b></font>) a Colonel Fitzwilliam, the younger son of
his (<font color='blue'><b>Darcy</b></font>) uncle Lord --, and, to the great surprise of all the party, when
Mr. Collins returned, the gentlemen accompanied him (<font color='blue'><b>Collins</b></font>). Charlotte had seen
them from her (<font color='blue'><b>Charlotte</b></font>) husband's room, crossing the road, and immediately running
into the other, told the girls what an honour they might expect, adding:

<p/><div class="bookquote">``I may thank you, Eliza, for this piece of civility. Mr. Darcy would
never have come so soon to wait upon me.''

 (<font color='red'><b>the girls</b></font>)</div><p/>Elizabeth had scarcely time to disclaim all right to the compliment,
before their approach was announced by the door-bell, and shortly
afterwards the three gentlemen entered the room. Colonel Fitzwilliam,
who led the way, was about thirty, not handsome, but in person and
address most truly the gentleman. Mr. Darcy looked just as he (<font color='blue'><b>Darcy</b></font>) had been
used to look in Hertfordshire--paid his (<font color='blue'><b>Darcy</b></font>) compliments, with his (<font color='blue'><b>Darcy</b></font>) usual
reserve, to Mrs. Collins, and whatever might be his (<font color='blue'><b>Darcy</b></font>) feelings toward her (<font color='blue'><b>Collins</b></font>)
friend, met her (<font color='blue'><b>Collins</b></font>) with every appearance of composure. Elizabeth merely
curtseyed to him (<font color='blue'><b>Darcy</b></font>) without saying a word.

<p/>Colonel Fitzwilliam entered into conversation directly with the
readiness and ease of a well-bred man, and talked very pleasantly; but
his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) cousin, after having addressed a slight observation on the house and
garden to Mrs. Collins, sat for some time without speaking to anybody.
At length, however, his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) civility was so far awakened as to inquire of
Elizabeth after the health of her (<font color='blue'><b>Elizabeth</b></font>) family. She (<font color='blue'><b>Elizabeth</b></font>) answered him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) in the usual
way, and after a moment's pause, added:

<p/><div class="bookquote">``My eldest sister has been in town these three months. Have you never
happened to see her (<font color='blue'><b>sister</b></font>) there?''

 (<font color='red'><b>him</b></font>)</div><p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>Elizabeth</b></font>) was perfectly sensible that he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) never had; but she (<font color='blue'><b>Elizabeth</b></font>) wished to see
whether he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) would betray any consciousness of what had passed between
the Bingleys and Jane, and she (<font color='blue'><b>Jane</b></font>) thought he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) looked a little confused as he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>)
answered that he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) had never been so fortunate as to meet Miss Bennet. The
subject was pursued no farther, and the gentlemen soon afterwards went
away.



<p/>Chapter 31


<p/>Colonel Fitzwilliam's manners were very much admired at the Parsonage,
and the ladies all felt that he (<font color='blue'><b>Colonel</b></font>) must add considerably to the pleasures
of their engagements at Rosings. It was some days, however, before they
received any invitation thither--for while there were visitors in the
house, they could not be necessary; and it was not till Easter-day,
almost a week after the gentlemen's arrival, that they were honoured by
such an attention, and then they were merely asked on leaving church to
come there in the evening. For the last week they had seen very little
of Lady Catherine or her (<font color='blue'><b>Catherine</b></font>) daughter. Colonel Fitzwilliam had called at the
Parsonage more than once during the time, but Mr. Darcy they had seen
only at church.

<p/>The invitation was accepted of course, and at a proper hour they joined
the party in Lady Catherine's drawing-room. Her (<font color='blue'><b>Catherine</b></font>) ladyship received
them civilly, but it was plain that their company was by no means so
acceptable as when she (<font color='blue'><b>Catherine</b></font>) could get nobody else; and she (<font color='blue'><b>Catherine</b></font>) was, in fact,
almost engrossed by her (<font color='blue'><b>Catherine</b></font>) nephews, speaking to them, especially to Darcy,
much more than to any other person in the room.

<p/>Colonel Fitzwilliam seemed really glad to see them; anything was a
welcome relief to him (<font color='blue'><b>Colonel</b></font>) at Rosings; and Mrs. Collins's pretty friend had
moreover caught his (<font color='blue'><b>friend</b></font>) fancy very much. He (<font color='blue'><b>friend</b></font>) now seated himself by her (<font color='blue'><b>Collins</b></font>), and
talked so agreeably of Kent and Hertfordshire, of travelling and staying
at home, of new books and music, that Elizabeth had never been half so
well entertained in that room before; and they conversed with so much
spirit and flow, as to draw the attention of Lady Catherine herself,
as well as of Mr. Darcy. _His (<font color='blue'><b>Darcy</b></font>)_ eyes had been soon and repeatedly turned
towards them with a look of curiosity; and that her (<font color='blue'><b>Catherine</b></font>) ladyship, after a
while, shared the feeling, was more openly acknowledged, for she (<font color='blue'><b>Catherine</b></font>) did not
scruple to call out:

<p/><div class="bookquote">``What is that you are saying, Fitzwilliam? What is it you are talking
of? What are you telling Miss Bennet? Let me hear what it is.''

 (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``We are speaking of music, madam,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>said he (<font color='blue'><b>Darcy</b></font>), when no longer able to avoid
a reply.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Of music! Then pray speak aloud. It is of all subjects my delight. I
must have my share in the conversation if you are speaking of music.
There are few people in England, I suppose, who have more true enjoyment
of music than myself, or a better natural taste. If I had ever learnt,
I should have been a great proficient. And so would Anne, if her (<font color='blue'><b>Anne</b></font>) health
had allowed her (<font color='blue'><b>Anne</b></font>) to apply. I am confident that she (<font color='blue'><b>Anne</b></font>) would have performed
delightfully. How does Georgiana get on, Darcy?''

 (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Darcy/Darcy</b></font>)</div><p/>Mr. Darcy spoke with affectionate praise of his (<font color='blue'><b>Darcy</b></font>) sister's proficiency.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``I am very glad to hear such a good account of her (<font color='blue'><b>Georgiana</b></font>),''  (<font color='red'><b>Lady Catherine/Lady Catherine de Bourgh/Catherine</b></font>)</div>said Lady
Catherine; <div class="bookquote">``and pray tell her (<font color='blue'><b>Georgiana</b></font>) from me, that she (<font color='blue'><b>Georgiana</b></font>) cannot expect to excel
if she (<font color='blue'><b>Georgiana</b></font>) does not practice a good deal.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Lady Catherine/Lady Catherine de Bourgh/Catherine</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I assure you, madam,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Darcy</b></font>) replied, <div class="bookquote">``that she (<font color='blue'><b>madam</b></font>) does not need such advice.
She (<font color='blue'><b>madam</b></font>) practises very constantly.''

 (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``So much the better. It cannot be done too much; and when I next write
to her (<font color='blue'><b>madam</b></font>), I shall charge her (<font color='blue'><b>madam</b></font>) not to neglect it on any account. I often
tell young ladies that no excellence in music is to be acquired without
constant practice. I have told Miss Bennet several times, that she (<font color='blue'><b>Bennet</b></font>)
will never play really well unless she (<font color='blue'><b>Bennet</b></font>) practises more; and though Mrs.
Collins has no instrument, she (<font color='blue'><b>Collins</b></font>) is very welcome, as I have often told
her (<font color='blue'><b>Collins</b></font>), to come to Rosings every day, and play on the pianoforte in Mrs.
Jenkinson's room. She (<font color='blue'><b>Jenkinson</b></font>) would be in nobody's way, you know, in that part
of the house.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Darcy/Darcy</b></font>)</div><p/>Mr. Darcy looked a little ashamed of his (<font color='blue'><b>Darcy</b></font>) aunt's ill-breeding, and made
no answer.

<p/>When coffee was over, Colonel Fitzwilliam reminded Elizabeth of having
promised to play to him (<font color='blue'><b>Colonel</b></font>); and she (<font color='blue'><b>Elizabeth</b></font>) sat down directly to the instrument. He (<font color='blue'><b>Colonel</b></font>)
drew a chair near her (<font color='blue'><b>Elizabeth</b></font>). Lady Catherine listened to half a song, and then
talked, as before, to her (<font color='blue'><b>Catherine</b></font>) other nephew; till the latter walked away
from her (<font color='blue'><b>Catherine</b></font>), and making with his (<font color='blue'><b>nephew</b></font>) usual deliberation towards the pianoforte
stationed himself so as to command a full view of the fair performer's
countenance. Elizabeth saw what he (<font color='blue'><b>performer</b></font>) was doing, and at the first
convenient pause, turned to him (<font color='blue'><b>performer</b></font>) with an arch smile, and said:

<p/><div class="bookquote">``You mean to frighten me, Mr. Darcy, by coming in all this state to hear
me? I will not be alarmed though your sister _does_ play so well. There
is a stubbornness about me that never can bear to be frightened at the
will of others. My courage always rises at every attempt to intimidate
me.''

 (<font color='red'><b>him</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I shall not say you are mistaken,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>performer</b></font>) replied, <div class="bookquote">``because you could not
really believe me to entertain any design of alarming you; and I have
had the pleasure of your acquaintance long enough to know that you find
great enjoyment in occasionally professing opinions which in fact are
not your own.''

 (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div><p/>Elizabeth laughed heartily at this picture of herself, and said to
Colonel Fitzwilliam, <div class="bookquote">``Your cousin will give you a very pretty notion of
me, and teach you not to believe a word I say. I am particularly unlucky
in meeting with a person so able to expose my real character, in a part
of the world where I had hoped to pass myself off with some degree of
credit. Indeed, Mr. Darcy, it is very ungenerous in you to mention all
that you knew to my disadvantage in Hertfordshire--and, give me leave to
say, very impolitic too--for it is provoking me to retaliate, and such
things may come out as will shock your relations to hear.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Fitzwilliam</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I am not afraid of you,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>said he (<font color='blue'><b>Colonel</b></font>), smilingly.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Pray let me hear what you have to accuse him (<font color='blue'><b>Darcy</b></font>) of,''  (<font color='red'><b>Colonel</b></font>)</div>cried Colonel
Fitzwilliam. <div class="bookquote">``I should like to know how he (<font color='blue'><b>Darcy</b></font>) behaves among strangers.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``You shall hear then--but prepare yourself for something very dreadful.
The first time of my ever seeing him (<font color='blue'><b>Darcy</b></font>) in Hertfordshire, you must know,
was at a ball--and at this ball, what do you think he (<font color='blue'><b>Darcy</b></font>) did? He (<font color='blue'><b>Darcy</b></font>) danced
only four dances, though gentlemen were scarce; and, to my certain
knowledge, more than one young lady was sitting down in want of a
partner. Mr. Darcy, you cannot deny the fact.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I had not at that time the honour of knowing any lady in the assembly
beyond my own party.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``True; and nobody can ever be introduced in a ball-room. Well, Colonel
Fitzwilliam, what do I play next? My fingers wait your orders.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Perhaps,''  (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Darcy/Darcy</b></font>)</div>said Darcy, <div class="bookquote">``I should have judged better, had I sought an
introduction; but I am ill-qualified to recommend myself to strangers.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Darcy/Darcy</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Shall we ask your cousin the reason of this?''  (<font color='red'><b>Elizabeth/Miss Bennet/Miss Elizabeth</b></font>)</div>said Elizabeth, still
addressing Colonel Fitzwilliam. <div class="bookquote">``Shall we ask him (<font color='blue'><b>cousin</b></font>) why a man of sense and
education, and who has lived in the world, is ill qualified to recommend
himself to strangers?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I can answer your question,''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>said Fitzwilliam, <div class="bookquote">``without applying to
him (<font color='blue'><b>cousin</b></font>). It is because he (<font color='blue'><b>cousin</b></font>) will not give himself the trouble.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I certainly have not the talent which some people possess,''  (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Darcy/Darcy</b></font>)</div>said Darcy,
<div class="bookquote">``of conversing easily with those I have never seen before. I cannot
catch their tone of conversation, or appear interested in their
concerns, as I often see done.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Darcy/Darcy</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``My fingers,''  (<font color='red'><b>Elizabeth/Miss Bennet/Miss Elizabeth</b></font>)</div>said Elizabeth, <div class="bookquote">``do not move over this instrument in the
masterly manner which I see so many women's do. They have not the same
force or rapidity, and do not produce the same expression. But then I
have always supposed it to be my own fault--because I will not take the
trouble of practising. It is not that I do not believe _my_ fingers as
capable as any other woman's of superior execution.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Elizabeth/Miss Bennet/Miss Elizabeth</b></font>)</div><p/>Darcy smiled and said, <div class="bookquote">``You are perfectly right. You have employed your
time much better. No one admitted to the privilege of hearing you can
think anything wanting. We neither of us perform to strangers.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Darcy/Darcy</b></font>)</div><p/>Here they were interrupted by Lady Catherine, who called out to know
what they were talking of. Elizabeth immediately began playing again.
Lady Catherine approached, and, after listening for a few minutes, said
to Darcy:

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Miss Bennet would not play at all amiss if she (<font color='blue'><b>Bennet</b></font>) practised more, and
could have the advantage of a London master. She (<font color='blue'><b>Bennet</b></font>) has a very good notion
of fingering, though her (<font color='blue'><b>Bennet</b></font>) taste is not equal to Anne's. Anne would have
been a delightful performer, had her (<font color='blue'><b>Anne</b></font>) health allowed her (<font color='blue'><b>Anne</b></font>) to learn.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Darcy/Darcy</b></font>)</div><p/>Elizabeth looked at Darcy to see how cordially he (<font color='blue'><b>Darcy</b></font>) assented to his (<font color='blue'><b>Darcy</b></font>)
cousin's praise; but neither at that moment nor at any other could she (<font color='blue'><b>Elizabeth</b></font>)
discern any symptom of love; and from the whole of his (<font color='blue'><b>Darcy</b></font>) behaviour to Miss
de Bourgh she (<font color='blue'><b>Elizabeth</b></font>) derived this comfort for Miss Bingley, that he (<font color='blue'><b>Darcy</b></font>) might have
been just as likely to marry _her (<font color='blue'><b>Bingley</b></font>)_, had she (<font color='blue'><b>Bingley</b></font>) been his (<font color='blue'><b>Darcy</b></font>) relation.

<p/>Lady Catherine continued her (<font color='blue'><b>Catherine</b></font>) remarks on Elizabeth's performance, mixing
with them many instructions on execution and taste. Elizabeth received
them with all the forbearance of civility, and, at the request of the
gentlemen, remained at the instrument till her (<font color='blue'><b>Elizabeth</b></font>) ladyship's carriage was
ready to take them all home.



<p/>Chapter 32


<p/>Elizabeth was sitting by herself the next morning, and writing to Jane
while Mrs. Collins and Maria were gone on business into the village,
when she (<font color='blue'><b>Collins</b></font>) was startled by a ring at the door, the certain signal of a
visitor. As she (<font color='blue'><b>Collins</b></font>) had heard no carriage, she (<font color='blue'><b>Collins</b></font>) thought it not unlikely to
be Lady Catherine, and under that apprehension was putting away her (<font color='blue'><b>Catherine</b></font>)
half-finished letter that she (<font color='blue'><b>Catherine</b></font>) might escape all impertinent questions,
when the door opened, and, to her (<font color='blue'><b>Catherine</b></font>) very great surprise, Mr. Darcy, and
Mr. Darcy only, entered the room.

<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Darcy</b></font>) seemed astonished too on finding her (<font color='blue'><b>Catherine</b></font>) alone, and apologised for his (<font color='blue'><b>Darcy</b></font>)
intrusion by letting her (<font color='blue'><b>Catherine</b></font>) know that he (<font color='blue'><b>Darcy</b></font>) had understood all the ladies were
to be within.

<p/>They then sat down, and when her (<font color='blue'><b>Catherine</b></font>) inquiries after Rosings were made,
seemed in danger of sinking into total silence. It was absolutely
necessary, therefore, to think of something, and in this emergence
recollecting _when_ she (<font color='blue'><b>Catherine</b></font>) had seen him (<font color='blue'><b>Darcy</b></font>) last in Hertfordshire, and
feeling curious to know what he (<font color='blue'><b>Darcy</b></font>) would say on the subject of their hasty
departure, she (<font color='blue'><b>Catherine</b></font>) observed:

<p/><div class="bookquote">``How very suddenly you all quitted Netherfield last November, Mr. Darcy!
It must have been a most agreeable surprise to Mr. Bingley to see you
all after him (<font color='blue'><b>Bingley</b></font>) so soon; for, if I recollect right, he (<font color='blue'><b>Bingley</b></font>) went but the day
before. He (<font color='blue'><b>Bingley</b></font>) and his (<font color='blue'><b>Bingley</b></font>) sisters were well, I hope, when you left London?''

 (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Perfectly so, I thank you.''

 (<font color='red'><b>She</b></font>)</div><p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>Catherine</b></font>) found that she (<font color='blue'><b>Catherine</b></font>) was to receive no other answer, and, after a short
pause added:

<p/><div class="bookquote">``I think I have understood that Mr. Bingley has not much idea of ever
returning to Netherfield again?''

 (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I have never heard him (<font color='blue'><b>Bingley</b></font>) say so; but it is probable that he (<font color='blue'><b>Bingley</b></font>) may spend
very little of his (<font color='blue'><b>Bingley</b></font>) time there in the future. He (<font color='blue'><b>Bingley</b></font>) has many friends, and
is at a time of life when friends and engagements are continually
increasing.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``If he (<font color='blue'><b>Bingley</b></font>) means to be but little at Netherfield, it would be better for
the neighbourhood that he (<font color='blue'><b>Bingley</b></font>) should give up the place entirely, for then we
might possibly get a settled family there. But, perhaps, Mr. Bingley did
not take the house so much for the convenience of the neighbourhood as
for his (<font color='blue'><b>Bingley</b></font>) own, and we must expect him (<font color='blue'><b>Bingley</b></font>) to keep it or quit it on the same
principle.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I should not be surprised,''  (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Darcy/Darcy</b></font>)</div>said Darcy, <div class="bookquote">``if he (<font color='blue'><b>Bingley</b></font>) were to give it up as
soon as any eligible purchase offers.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Darcy/Darcy</b></font>)</div><p/>Elizabeth made no answer. She (<font color='blue'><b>Elizabeth</b></font>) was afraid of talking longer of his (<font color='blue'><b>Darcy</b></font>)
friend; and, having nothing else to say, was now determined to leave the
trouble of finding a subject to him (<font color='blue'><b>Darcy</b></font>).

<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Darcy</b></font>) took the hint, and soon began with, <div class="bookquote">``This seems a very comfortable
house. Lady Catherine, I believe, did a great deal to it when Mr.
Collins first came to Hunsford.''

 (<font color='red'><b>He</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I believe she (<font color='blue'><b>Catherine</b></font>) did--and I am sure she (<font color='blue'><b>Catherine</b></font>) could not have bestowed her (<font color='blue'><b>Catherine</b></font>)
kindness on a more grateful object.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Mr. Collins appears to be very fortunate in his (<font color='blue'><b>Collins</b></font>) choice of a wife.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Yes, indeed, his (<font color='blue'><b>Collins</b></font>) friends may well rejoice in his (<font color='blue'><b>Collins</b></font>) having met with one
of the very few sensible women who would have accepted him (<font color='blue'><b>Collins</b></font>), or have made
him (<font color='blue'><b>Collins</b></font>) happy if they had. My friend has an excellent understanding--though
I am not certain that I consider her (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>) marrying Mr. Collins as the
wisest thing she (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>) ever did. She (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>) seems perfectly happy, however, and in a
prudential light it is certainly a very good match for her (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>).''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``It must be very agreeable for her (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>) to be settled within so easy a
distance of her (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>) own family and friends.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``An easy distance, do you call it? It is nearly fifty miles.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``And what is fifty miles of good road? Little more than half a day's
journey. Yes, I call it a _very_ easy distance.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I should never have considered the distance as one of the _advantages_
of the match,''  (<font color='red'><b>Elizabeth/Miss Bennet/Miss Elizabeth</b></font>)</div>cried Elizabeth. <div class="bookquote">``I should never have said Mrs. Collins
was settled _near_ her (<font color='blue'><b>Collins</b></font>) family.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``It is a proof of your own attachment to Hertfordshire. Anything beyond
the very neighbourhood of Longbourn, I suppose, would appear far.''

 (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div><p/>As he (<font color='blue'><b>Darcy</b></font>) spoke there was a sort of smile which Elizabeth fancied she (<font color='blue'><b>Elizabeth</b></font>)
understood; he (<font color='blue'><b>Darcy</b></font>) must be supposing her (<font color='blue'><b>Elizabeth</b></font>) to be thinking of Jane and
Netherfield, and she (<font color='blue'><b>Elizabeth</b></font>) blushed as she (<font color='blue'><b>Elizabeth</b></font>) answered:

<p/><div class="bookquote">``I do not mean to say that a woman may not be settled too near her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>)
family. The far and the near must be relative, and depend on many
varying circumstances. Where there is fortune to make the expenses of
travelling unimportant, distance becomes no evil. But that is not the
case _here_. Mr. and Mrs. Collins have a comfortable income, but not
such a one as will allow of frequent journeys--and I am persuaded my
friend would not call herself _near_ her (<font color='blue'><b>Collins</b></font>) family under less than _half_
the present distance.''

 (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div><p/>Mr. Darcy drew his (<font color='blue'><b>Darcy</b></font>) chair a little towards her (<font color='blue'><b>Elizabeth</b></font>), and said, <div class="bookquote">''_You_ cannot
have a right to such very strong local attachment. _You_ cannot have
been always at Longbourn.''

 (<font color='red'><b>her</b></font>)</div><p/>Elizabeth looked surprised. The gentleman experienced some change of
feeling; he (<font color='blue'><b>gentleman</b></font>) drew back his (<font color='blue'><b>gentleman</b></font>) chair, took a newspaper from the table, and
glancing over it, said, in a colder voice:

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Are you pleased with Kent?''

 (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div><p/>A short dialogue on the subject of the country ensued, on either side
calm and concise--and soon put an end to by the entrance of Charlotte
and her (<font color='blue'><b>Charlotte</b></font>) sister, just returned from her (<font color='blue'><b>Charlotte</b></font>) walk. The tete-a-tete surprised
them. Mr. Darcy related the mistake which had occasioned his (<font color='blue'><b>Darcy</b></font>) intruding
on Miss Bennet, and after sitting a few minutes longer without saying
much to anybody, went away.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``What can be the meaning of this?''  (<font color='red'><b>Charlotte</b></font>)</div>said Charlotte, as soon as he (<font color='blue'><b>Darcy</b></font>) was
gone. <div class="bookquote">``My dear, Eliza, he (<font color='blue'><b>Kent</b></font>) must be in love with you, or he (<font color='blue'><b>Kent</b></font>) would never
have called us in this familiar way.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Elizabeth/Miss Bennet/Miss Elizabeth</b></font>)</div><p/>But when Elizabeth told of his (<font color='blue'><b>Darcy</b></font>) silence, it did not seem very likely,
even to Charlotte's wishes, to be the case; and after various
conjectures, they could at last only suppose his (<font color='blue'><b>Darcy</b></font>) visit to proceed from
the difficulty of finding anything to do, which was the more probable
from the time of year. All field sports were over. Within doors there
was Lady Catherine, books, and a billiard-table, but gentlemen cannot
always be within doors; and in the nearness of the Parsonage, or the
pleasantness of the walk to it, or of the people who lived in it, the
two cousins found a temptation from this period of walking thither
almost every day. They called at various times of the morning, sometimes
separately, sometimes together, and now and then accompanied by their
aunt. It was plain to them all that Colonel Fitzwilliam came because he (<font color='blue'><b>Colonel</b></font>)
had pleasure in their society, a persuasion which of course recommended
him (<font color='blue'><b>Colonel</b></font>) still more; and Elizabeth was reminded by her (<font color='blue'><b>Elizabeth</b></font>) own satisfaction in
being with him (<font color='blue'><b>Colonel</b></font>), as well as by his (<font color='blue'><b>Colonel</b></font>) evident admiration of her (<font color='blue'><b>Elizabeth</b></font>), of her (<font color='blue'><b>Elizabeth</b></font>)
former favourite George Wickham; and though, in comparing them, she (<font color='blue'><b>Elizabeth</b></font>) saw
there was less captivating softness in Colonel Fitzwilliam's manners,
she (<font color='blue'><b>Elizabeth</b></font>) believed he (<font color='blue'><b>Colonel</b></font>) might have the best informed mind.

<p/>But why Mr. Darcy came so often to the Parsonage, it was more difficult
to understand. It could not be for society, as he (<font color='blue'><b>Darcy</b></font>) frequently sat there
ten minutes together without opening his (<font color='blue'><b>Darcy</b></font>) lips; and when he (<font color='blue'><b>Darcy</b></font>) did speak,
it seemed the effect of necessity rather than of choice--a sacrifice
to propriety, not a pleasure to himself. He (<font color='blue'><b>Darcy</b></font>) seldom appeared really
animated. Mrs. Collins knew not what to make of him (<font color='blue'><b>Darcy</b></font>). Colonel
Fitzwilliam's occasionally laughing at his (<font color='blue'><b>Colonel</b></font>) stupidity, proved that he (<font color='blue'><b>Colonel</b></font>) was
generally different, which her (<font color='blue'><b>Collins</b></font>) own knowledge of him (<font color='blue'><b>Colonel</b></font>) could not have told
her (<font color='blue'><b>Collins</b></font>); and as she (<font color='blue'><b>Collins</b></font>) would liked to have believed this change the effect
of love, and the object of that love her (<font color='blue'><b>Collins</b></font>) friend Eliza, she (<font color='blue'><b>Collins</b></font>) set herself
seriously to work to find it out. She (<font color='blue'><b>Collins</b></font>) watched him (<font color='blue'><b>friend</b></font>) whenever they were at
Rosings, and whenever he (<font color='blue'><b>friend</b></font>) came to Hunsford; but without much success. He (<font color='blue'><b>friend</b></font>)
certainly looked at her (<font color='blue'><b>Collins</b></font>) friend a great deal, but the expression of that
look was disputable. It was an earnest, steadfast gaze, but she (<font color='blue'><b>Collins</b></font>) often
doubted whether there were much admiration in it, and sometimes it
seemed nothing but absence of mind.

<p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>Collins</b></font>) had once or twice suggested to Elizabeth the possibility of his (<font color='blue'><b>friend</b></font>)
being partial to her (<font color='blue'><b>Elizabeth</b></font>), but Elizabeth always laughed at the idea; and Mrs.
Collins did not think it right to press the subject, from the danger of
raising expectations which might only end in disappointment; for in her (<font color='blue'><b>Collins</b></font>)
opinion it admitted not of a doubt, that all her (<font color='blue'><b>Collins</b></font>) friend's dislike would
vanish, if she (<font color='blue'><b>Collins</b></font>) could suppose him (<font color='blue'><b>friend</b></font>) to be in her (<font color='blue'><b>Collins</b></font>) power.


<p/>In her (<font color='blue'><b>Collins</b></font>) kind schemes for Elizabeth, she (<font color='blue'><b>Elizabeth</b></font>) sometimes planned her (<font color='blue'><b>Elizabeth</b></font>) marrying
Colonel Fitzwilliam. He (<font color='blue'><b>Colonel</b></font>) was beyond comparison the most pleasant man; he (<font color='blue'><b>Colonel</b></font>)
certainly admired her (<font color='blue'><b>Elizabeth</b></font>), and his (<font color='blue'><b>Colonel</b></font>) situation in life was most eligible; but,
to counterbalance these advantages, Mr. Darcy had considerable patronage
in the church, and his (<font color='blue'><b>Darcy</b></font>) cousin could have none at all.



<p/>Chapter 33


<p/>More than once did Elizabeth, in her (<font color='blue'><b>Elizabeth</b></font>) ramble within the park,
unexpectedly meet Mr. Darcy. She (<font color='blue'><b>Elizabeth</b></font>) felt all the perverseness of the
mischance that should bring him (<font color='blue'><b>Darcy</b></font>) where no one else was brought, and, to
prevent its ever happening again, took care to inform him (<font color='blue'><b>Darcy</b></font>) at first that
it was a favourite haunt of hers. How it could occur a second time,
therefore, was very odd! Yet it did, and even a third. It seemed like
wilful ill-nature, or a voluntary penance, for on these occasions it was
not merely a few formal inquiries and an awkward pause and then away,
but he (<font color='blue'><b>Darcy</b></font>) actually thought it necessary to turn back and walk with her (<font color='blue'><b>Darcy</b></font>). He (<font color='blue'><b>Darcy</b></font>)
never said a great deal, nor did she (<font color='blue'><b>Darcy</b></font>) give herself the trouble of talking
or of listening much; but it struck her (<font color='blue'><b>Darcy</b></font>) in the course of their third
rencontre that he (<font color='blue'><b>Darcy</b></font>) was asking some odd unconnected questions--about
her (<font color='blue'><b>Darcy</b></font>) pleasure in being at Hunsford, her (<font color='blue'><b>Darcy</b></font>) love of solitary walks, and her (<font color='blue'><b>Darcy</b></font>)
opinion of Mr. and Mrs. Collins's happiness; and that in speaking of
Rosings and her (<font color='blue'><b>Darcy</b></font>) not perfectly understanding the house, he (<font color='blue'><b>Darcy</b></font>) seemed to
expect that whenever she (<font color='blue'><b>Darcy</b></font>) came into Kent again she (<font color='blue'><b>Darcy</b></font>) would be staying
_there_ too. His (<font color='blue'><b>Kent</b></font>) words seemed to imply it. Could he (<font color='blue'><b>Kent</b></font>) have Colonel
Fitzwilliam in his (<font color='blue'><b>Kent</b></font>) thoughts? She (<font color='blue'><b>Darcy</b></font>) supposed, if he (<font color='blue'><b>Kent</b></font>) meant anything, he (<font color='blue'><b>Kent</b></font>) must
mean an allusion to what might arise in that quarter. It distressed
her (<font color='blue'><b>Darcy</b></font>) a little, and she (<font color='blue'><b>Darcy</b></font>) was quite glad to find herself at the gate in the
pales opposite the Parsonage.

<p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>Darcy</b></font>) was engaged one day as she (<font color='blue'><b>Darcy</b></font>) walked, in perusing Jane's last letter,
and dwelling on some passages which proved that Jane had not written in
spirits, when, instead of being again surprised by Mr. Darcy, she (<font color='blue'><b>Jane</b></font>) saw
on looking up that Colonel Fitzwilliam was meeting her (<font color='blue'><b>Jane</b></font>). Putting away the
letter immediately and forcing a smile, she (<font color='blue'><b>Jane</b></font>) said:

<p/><div class="bookquote">``I did not know before that you ever walked this way.''

 (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I have been making the tour of the park,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Colonel</b></font>) replied, <div class="bookquote">``as I generally
do every year, and intend to close it with a call at the Parsonage. Are
you going much farther?''

 (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``No, I should have turned in a moment.''

 (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div><p/>And accordingly she (<font color='blue'><b>Jane</b></font>) did turn, and they walked towards the Parsonage
together.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Do you certainly leave Kent on Saturday?''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>said she (<font color='blue'><b>Jane</b></font>).

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Yes--if Darcy does not put it off again. But I am at his (<font color='blue'><b>Darcy</b></font>) disposal. He (<font color='blue'><b>Darcy</b></font>)
arranges the business just as he (<font color='blue'><b>Darcy</b></font>) pleases.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``And if not able to please himself in the arrangement, he (<font color='blue'><b>Darcy</b></font>) has at least
pleasure in the great power of choice. I do not know anybody who seems
more to enjoy the power of doing what he (<font color='blue'><b>Darcy</b></font>) likes than Mr. Darcy.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``He (<font color='blue'><b>Darcy</b></font>) likes to have his (<font color='blue'><b>Darcy</b></font>) own way very well,''  (<font color='red'><b>Colonel</b></font>)</div>replied Colonel Fitzwilliam.
<div class="bookquote">``But so we all do. It is only that he (<font color='blue'><b>Darcy</b></font>) has better means of having it
than many others, because he (<font color='blue'><b>Darcy</b></font>) is rich, and many others are poor. I speak
feelingly. A younger son, you know, must be inured to self-denial and
dependence.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``In my opinion, the younger son of an earl can know very little of
either. Now seriously, what have you ever known of self-denial and
dependence? When have you been prevented by want of money from going
wherever you chose, or procuring anything you had a fancy for?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``These are home questions--and perhaps I cannot say that I have
experienced many hardships of that nature. But in matters of greater
weight, I may suffer from want of money. Younger sons cannot marry where
they like.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Unless where they like women of fortune, which I think they very often
do.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Our habits of expense make us too dependent, and there are not many
in my rank of life who can afford to marry without some attention to
money.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Is this,''  (<font color='red'><b>Elizabeth/Miss Bennet/Miss Elizabeth</b></font>)</div>thought Elizabeth, <div class="bookquote">``meant for me?''  (<font color='red'><b>Elizabeth/Miss Bennet/Miss Elizabeth</b></font>)</div>and she (<font color='blue'><b>Elizabeth</b></font>) coloured at the
idea; but, recovering herself, said in a lively tone, <div class="bookquote">``And pray, what
is the usual price of an earl's younger son? Unless the elder brother is
very sickly, I suppose you would not ask above fifty thousand pounds.''

 (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div><p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Colonel</b></font>) answered her (<font color='blue'><b>Elizabeth</b></font>) in the same style, and the subject dropped. To interrupt
a silence which might make him (<font color='blue'><b>Colonel</b></font>) fancy her (<font color='blue'><b>Elizabeth</b></font>) affected with what had passed,
she (<font color='blue'><b>Elizabeth</b></font>) soon afterwards said:

<p/><div class="bookquote">``I imagine your cousin brought you down with him (<font color='blue'><b>cousin</b></font>) chiefly for the sake of
having someone at his (<font color='blue'><b>cousin</b></font>) disposal. I wonder he (<font color='blue'><b>cousin</b></font>) does not marry, to secure a
lasting convenience of that kind. But, perhaps, his (<font color='blue'><b>cousin</b></font>) sister does as well
for the present, and, as she (<font color='blue'><b>sister</b></font>) is under his (<font color='blue'><b>cousin</b></font>) sole care, he (<font color='blue'><b>cousin</b></font>) may do what he (<font color='blue'><b>cousin</b></font>)
likes with her (<font color='blue'><b>sister</b></font>).''

 (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``No,''  (<font color='red'><b>Colonel</b></font>)</div>said Colonel Fitzwilliam, <div class="bookquote">``that is an advantage which he (<font color='blue'><b>cousin</b></font>) must
divide with me. I am joined with him (<font color='blue'><b>cousin</b></font>) in the guardianship of Miss Darcy.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Fitzwilliam</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Are you indeed? And pray what sort of guardians do you make? Does your
charge give you much trouble? Young ladies of her (<font color='blue'><b>Darcy</b></font>) age are sometimes a
little difficult to manage, and if she (<font color='blue'><b>Darcy</b></font>) has the true Darcy spirit, she (<font color='blue'><b>Darcy</b></font>)
may like to have her (<font color='blue'><b>Darcy</b></font>) own way.''

 (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div><p/>As she (<font color='blue'><b>Elizabeth</b></font>) spoke she (<font color='blue'><b>Elizabeth</b></font>) observed him (<font color='blue'><b>Colonel</b></font>) looking at her (<font color='blue'><b>Elizabeth</b></font>) earnestly; and the manner
in which he (<font color='blue'><b>Colonel</b></font>) immediately asked her (<font color='blue'><b>Elizabeth</b></font>) why she (<font color='blue'><b>Elizabeth</b></font>) supposed Miss Darcy likely to
give them any uneasiness, convinced her (<font color='blue'><b>Darcy</b></font>) that she (<font color='blue'><b>Darcy</b></font>) had somehow or other
got pretty near the truth. She (<font color='blue'><b>Darcy</b></font>) directly replied:

<p/><div class="bookquote">``You need not be frightened. I never heard any harm of her (<font color='blue'><b>Darcy</b></font>); and I dare
say she (<font color='blue'><b>Darcy</b></font>) is one of the most tractable creatures in the world. She (<font color='blue'><b>Darcy</b></font>) is a
very great favourite with some ladies of my acquaintance, Mrs. Hurst and
Miss Bingley. I think I have heard you say that you know them.''

 (<font color='red'><b>She</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I know them a little. Their brother is a pleasant gentlemanlike man--he (<font color='blue'><b>brother</b></font>)
is a great friend of Darcy's.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Oh! yes,''  (<font color='red'><b>Elizabeth/Miss Bennet/Miss Elizabeth</b></font>)</div>said Elizabeth drily; <div class="bookquote">``Mr. Darcy is uncommonly kind to Mr.
Bingley, and takes a prodigious deal of care of him (<font color='blue'><b>Darcy</b></font>).''

 (<font color='red'><b>Elizabeth/Miss Bennet/Miss Elizabeth</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Care of him (<font color='blue'><b>Darcy</b></font>)! Yes, I really believe Darcy _does_ take care of him (<font color='blue'><b>Darcy</b></font>) in
those points where he (<font color='blue'><b>Darcy</b></font>) most wants care. From something that he (<font color='blue'><b>Darcy</b></font>) told me in
our journey hither, I have reason to think Bingley very much indebted to
him (<font color='blue'><b>Bingley</b></font>). But I ought to beg his (<font color='blue'><b>Bingley</b></font>) pardon, for I have no right to suppose that
Bingley was the person meant. It was all conjecture.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``What is it you mean?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``It is a circumstance which Darcy could not wish to be generally known,
because if it were to get round to the lady's family, it would be an
unpleasant thing.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``You may depend upon my not mentioning it.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``And remember that I have not much reason for supposing it to be
Bingley. What he (<font color='blue'><b>Darcy</b></font>) told me was merely this: that he (<font color='blue'><b>Darcy</b></font>) congratulated himself
on having lately saved a friend from the inconveniences of a most
imprudent marriage, but without mentioning names or any other
particulars, and I only suspected it to be Bingley from believing
him (<font color='blue'><b>Bingley</b></font>) the kind of young man to get into a scrape of that sort, and from
knowing them to have been together the whole of last summer.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Did Mr. Darcy give you reasons for this interference?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I understood that there were some very strong objections against the
lady.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``And what arts did he (<font color='blue'><b>Darcy</b></font>) use to separate them?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``He (<font color='blue'><b>Darcy</b></font>) did not talk to me of his (<font color='blue'><b>Darcy</b></font>) own arts,''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>said Fitzwilliam, smiling. <div class="bookquote">``He (<font color='blue'><b>Darcy</b></font>)
only told me what I have now told you.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Elizabeth/Miss Bennet/Miss Elizabeth</b></font>)</div><p/>Elizabeth made no answer, and walked on, her (<font color='blue'><b>Elizabeth</b></font>) heart swelling with
indignation. After watching her (<font color='blue'><b>Elizabeth</b></font>) a little, Fitzwilliam asked her (<font color='blue'><b>Elizabeth</b></font>) why she (<font color='blue'><b>Elizabeth</b></font>)
was so thoughtful.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``I am thinking of what you have been telling me,''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>said she (<font color='blue'><b>Elizabeth</b></font>). <div class="bookquote">``Your
cousin's conduct does not suit my feelings. Why was he (<font color='blue'><b>cousin</b></font>) to be the judge?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``You are rather disposed to call his (<font color='blue'><b>cousin</b></font>) interference officious?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I do not see what right Mr. Darcy had to decide on the propriety of his (<font color='blue'><b>Darcy</b></font>)
friend's inclination, or why, upon his (<font color='blue'><b>Darcy</b></font>) own judgement alone, he (<font color='blue'><b>Darcy</b></font>) was to
determine and direct in what manner his (<font color='blue'><b>Darcy</b></font>) friend was to be happy.
But,''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Elizabeth</b></font>) continued, recollecting herself, <div class="bookquote">``as we know none of the
particulars, it is not fair to condemn him (<font color='blue'><b>Darcy</b></font>). It is not to be supposed
that there was much affection in the case.''

 (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``That is not an unnatural surmise,''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>said Fitzwilliam, <div class="bookquote">``but it is a
lessening of the honour of my cousin's triumph very sadly.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/>This was spoken jestingly; but it appeared to her (<font color='blue'><b>Elizabeth</b></font>) so just a picture
of Mr. Darcy, that she (<font color='blue'><b>Elizabeth</b></font>) would not trust herself with an answer, and
therefore, abruptly changing the conversation talked on indifferent
matters until they reached the Parsonage. There, shut into her (<font color='blue'><b>Elizabeth</b></font>) own room,
as soon as their visitor left them, she (<font color='blue'><b>Elizabeth</b></font>) could think without interruption
of all that she (<font color='blue'><b>Elizabeth</b></font>) had heard. It was not to be supposed that any other
people could be meant than those with whom she (<font color='blue'><b>Elizabeth</b></font>) was connected. There
could not exist in the world _two_ men over whom Mr. Darcy could have
such boundless influence. That he (<font color='blue'><b>Darcy</b></font>) had been concerned in the measures
taken to separate Bingley and Jane she (<font color='blue'><b>Jane</b></font>) had never doubted; but she (<font color='blue'><b>Jane</b></font>) had
always attributed to Miss Bingley the principal design and arrangement
of them. If his (<font color='blue'><b>Darcy</b></font>) own vanity, however, did not mislead him (<font color='blue'><b>Darcy</b></font>), _he (<font color='blue'><b>Darcy</b></font>)_ was
the cause, his (<font color='blue'><b>Darcy</b></font>) pride and caprice were the cause, of all that Jane had
suffered, and still continued to suffer. He (<font color='blue'><b>Darcy</b></font>) had ruined for a while
every hope of happiness for the most affectionate, generous heart in the
world; and no one could say how lasting an evil he (<font color='blue'><b>Darcy</b></font>) might have inflicted.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``There were some very strong objections against the lady,''  (<font color='red'><b>Colonel</b></font>)</div>were Colonel
Fitzwilliam's words; and those strong objections probably were, her (<font color='blue'><b>Jane</b></font>)
having one uncle who was a country attorney, and another who was in
business in London.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``To Jane herself,''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Jane</b></font>) exclaimed, <div class="bookquote">``there could be no possibility of
objection; all loveliness and goodness as she (<font color='blue'><b>Jane</b></font>) is!--her (<font color='blue'><b>Jane</b></font>) understanding
excellent, her (<font color='blue'><b>Jane</b></font>) mind improved, and her (<font color='blue'><b>Jane</b></font>) manners captivating. Neither
could anything be urged against my father, who, though with some
peculiarities, has abilities Mr. Darcy himself need not disdain, and
respectability which he (<font color='blue'><b>Darcy</b></font>) will probably never reach.''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>When she (<font color='blue'><b>Jane</b></font>) thought of
her (<font color='blue'><b>Jane</b></font>) mother, her (<font color='blue'><b>Jane</b></font>) confidence gave way a little; but she (<font color='blue'><b>Jane</b></font>) would not allow
that any objections _there_ had material weight with Mr. Darcy, whose
pride, she (<font color='blue'><b>Jane</b></font>) was convinced, would receive a deeper wound from the want of
importance in his (<font color='blue'><b>Darcy</b></font>) friend's connections, than from their want of sense;
and she (<font color='blue'><b>Jane</b></font>) was quite decided, at last, that he (<font color='blue'><b>Darcy</b></font>) had been partly governed
by this worst kind of pride, and partly by the wish of retaining Mr.
Bingley for his (<font color='blue'><b>Bingley</b></font>) sister.

<p/>The agitation and tears which the subject occasioned, brought on a
headache; and it grew so much worse towards the evening, that, added to
her (<font color='blue'><b>sister</b></font>) unwillingness to see Mr. Darcy, it determined her (<font color='blue'><b>sister</b></font>) not to attend her (<font color='blue'><b>sister</b></font>)
cousins to Rosings, where they were engaged to drink tea. Mrs. Collins,
seeing that she (<font color='blue'><b>Collins</b></font>) was really unwell, did not press her (<font color='blue'><b>Collins</b></font>) to go and as much
as possible prevented her (<font color='blue'><b>Collins</b></font>) husband from pressing her (<font color='blue'><b>Collins</b></font>); but Mr. Collins
could not conceal his (<font color='blue'><b>Collins</b></font>) apprehension of Lady Catherine's being rather
displeased by her (<font color='blue'><b>Catherine</b></font>) staying at home.



<p/>Chapter 34


<p/>When they were gone, Elizabeth, as if intending to exasperate herself
as much as possible against Mr. Darcy, chose for her (<font color='blue'><b>Elizabeth</b></font>) employment the
examination of all the letters which Jane had written to her (<font color='blue'><b>Jane</b></font>) since her (<font color='blue'><b>Jane</b></font>)
being in Kent. They contained no actual complaint, nor was there any
revival of past occurrences, or any communication of present suffering.
But in all, and in almost every line of each, there was a want of that
cheerfulness which had been used to characterise her (<font color='blue'><b>Jane</b></font>) style, and which,
proceeding from the serenity of a mind at ease with itself and kindly
disposed towards everyone, had been scarcely ever clouded. Elizabeth
noticed every sentence conveying the idea of uneasiness, with an
attention which it had hardly received on the first perusal. Mr. Darcy's
shameful boast of what misery he (<font color='blue'><b>Darcy</b></font>) had been able to inflict, gave her (<font color='blue'><b>Elizabeth</b></font>)
a keener sense of her (<font color='blue'><b>Elizabeth</b></font>) sister's sufferings. It was some consolation
to think that his (<font color='blue'><b>Darcy</b></font>) visit to Rosings was to end on the day after the
next--and, a still greater, that in less than a fortnight she (<font color='blue'><b>Elizabeth</b></font>) should
herself be with Jane again, and enabled to contribute to the recovery of
her (<font color='blue'><b>Jane</b></font>) spirits, by all that affection could do.

<p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>Jane</b></font>) could not think of Darcy's leaving Kent without remembering that
his (<font color='blue'><b>Darcy</b></font>) cousin was to go with him (<font color='blue'><b>Darcy</b></font>); but Colonel Fitzwilliam had made it clear
that he (<font color='blue'><b>Colonel</b></font>) had no intentions at all, and agreeable as he (<font color='blue'><b>Colonel</b></font>) was, she (<font color='blue'><b>Jane</b></font>) did not
mean to be unhappy about him (<font color='blue'><b>Colonel</b></font>).

<p/>While settling this point, she (<font color='blue'><b>Jane</b></font>) was suddenly roused by the sound of the
door-bell, and her (<font color='blue'><b>Jane</b></font>) spirits were a little fluttered by the idea of its
being Colonel Fitzwilliam himself, who had once before called late in
the evening, and might now come to inquire particularly after her (<font color='blue'><b>Jane</b></font>).
But this idea was soon banished, and her (<font color='blue'><b>Jane</b></font>) spirits were very differently
affected, when, to her (<font color='blue'><b>Jane</b></font>) utter amazement, she (<font color='blue'><b>Jane</b></font>) saw Mr. Darcy walk into the
room. In an hurried manner he (<font color='blue'><b>Darcy</b></font>) immediately began an inquiry after her (<font color='blue'><b>Jane</b></font>)
health, imputing his (<font color='blue'><b>Darcy</b></font>) visit to a wish of hearing that she (<font color='blue'><b>Jane</b></font>) were better.
She (<font color='blue'><b>Jane</b></font>) answered him (<font color='blue'><b>Darcy</b></font>) with cold civility. He (<font color='blue'><b>Darcy</b></font>) sat down for a few moments, and
then getting up, walked about the room. Elizabeth was surprised, but
said not a word. After a silence of several minutes, he (<font color='blue'><b>Darcy</b></font>) came towards her (<font color='blue'><b>Elizabeth</b></font>)
in an agitated manner, and thus began:

<p/><div class="bookquote">``In vain I have struggled. It will not do. My feelings will not be
repressed. You must allow me to tell you how ardently I admire and love
you.''

 (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div><p/>Elizabeth's astonishment was beyond expression. She (<font color='blue'><b>Elizabeth</b></font>) stared, coloured,
doubted, and was silent. This he (<font color='blue'><b>Darcy</b></font>) considered sufficient encouragement;
and the avowal of all that he (<font color='blue'><b>Darcy</b></font>) felt, and had long felt for her (<font color='blue'><b>Elizabeth</b></font>),
immediately followed. He (<font color='blue'><b>Darcy</b></font>) spoke well; but there were feelings besides
those of the heart to be detailed; and he (<font color='blue'><b>Darcy</b></font>) was not more eloquent on the
subject of tenderness than of pride. His (<font color='blue'><b>Darcy</b></font>) sense of her (<font color='blue'><b>Elizabeth</b></font>) inferiority--of
its being a degradation--of the family obstacles which had always
opposed to inclination, were dwelt on with a warmth which seemed due to
the consequence he (<font color='blue'><b>Darcy</b></font>) was wounding, but was very unlikely to recommend his (<font color='blue'><b>Darcy</b></font>)
suit.

<p/>In spite of her (<font color='blue'><b>Elizabeth</b></font>) deeply-rooted dislike, she (<font color='blue'><b>Elizabeth</b></font>) could not be insensible to
the compliment of such a man's affection, and though her (<font color='blue'><b>Elizabeth</b></font>) intentions did
not vary for an instant, she (<font color='blue'><b>Elizabeth</b></font>) was at first sorry for the pain he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) was to
receive; till, roused to resentment by his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) subsequent language, she (<font color='blue'><b>Elizabeth</b></font>)
lost all compassion in anger. She (<font color='blue'><b>Elizabeth</b></font>) tried, however, to compose herself to
answer him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) with patience, when he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) should have done. He (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) concluded with
representing to her (<font color='blue'><b>Elizabeth</b></font>) the strength of that attachment which, in spite
of all his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) endeavours, he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) had found impossible to conquer; and with
expressing his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) hope that it would now be rewarded by her (<font color='blue'><b>Elizabeth</b></font>) acceptance of
his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) hand. As he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) said this, she (<font color='blue'><b>Elizabeth</b></font>) could easily see that he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) had no doubt
of a favourable answer. He (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) _spoke_ of apprehension and anxiety, but
his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) countenance expressed real security. Such a circumstance could
only exasperate farther, and, when he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) ceased, the colour rose into her (<font color='blue'><b>Elizabeth</b></font>)
cheeks, and she (<font color='blue'><b>Elizabeth</b></font>) said:

<p/><div class="bookquote">``In such cases as this, it is, I believe, the established mode to
express a sense of obligation for the sentiments avowed, however
unequally they may be returned. It is natural that obligation should
be felt, and if I could _feel_ gratitude, I would now thank you. But I
cannot--I have never desired your good opinion, and you have certainly
bestowed it most unwillingly. I am sorry to have occasioned pain to
anyone. It has been most unconsciously done, however, and I hope will be
of short duration. The feelings which, you tell me, have long prevented
the acknowledgment of your regard, can have little difficulty in
overcoming it after this explanation.''

 (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div><p/>Mr. Darcy, who was leaning against the mantelpiece with his (<font color='blue'><b>Darcy</b></font>) eyes fixed
on her (<font color='blue'><b>Elizabeth</b></font>) face, seemed to catch her (<font color='blue'><b>Elizabeth</b></font>) words with no less resentment than
surprise. His (<font color='blue'><b>Darcy</b></font>) complexion became pale with anger, and the disturbance
of his (<font color='blue'><b>Darcy</b></font>) mind was visible in every feature. He (<font color='blue'><b>Darcy</b></font>) was struggling for the
appearance of composure, and would not open his (<font color='blue'><b>Darcy</b></font>) lips till he (<font color='blue'><b>Darcy</b></font>) believed
himself to have attained it. The pause was to Elizabeth's feelings
dreadful. At length, with a voice of forced calmness, he (<font color='blue'><b>Darcy</b></font>) said:

<p/><div class="bookquote">``And this is all the reply which I am to have the honour of expecting!
I might, perhaps, wish to be informed why, with so little _endeavour_ at
civility, I am thus rejected. But it is of small importance.''

 (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I might as well inquire,''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>replied she (<font color='blue'><b>Elizabeth</b></font>), <div class="bookquote">``why with so evident a desire
of offending and insulting me, you chose to tell me that you liked me
against your will, against your reason, and even against your character?
Was not this some excuse for incivility, if I _was_ uncivil? But I have
other provocations. You know I have. Had not my feelings decided against
you--had they been indifferent, or had they even been favourable, do you
think that any consideration would tempt me to accept the man who has
been the means of ruining, perhaps for ever, the happiness of a most
beloved sister?''

 (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div><p/>As she (<font color='blue'><b>Elizabeth</b></font>) pronounced these words, Mr. Darcy changed colour; but the emotion
was short, and he (<font color='blue'><b>Darcy</b></font>) listened without attempting to interrupt her (<font color='blue'><b>Elizabeth</b></font>) while she (<font color='blue'><b>Elizabeth</b></font>)
continued:

<p/><div class="bookquote">``I have every reason in the world to think ill of you. No motive can
excuse the unjust and ungenerous part you acted _there_. You dare not,
you cannot deny, that you have been the principal, if not the only means
of dividing them from each other--of exposing one to the censure of the
world for caprice and instability, and the other to its derision for
disappointed hopes, and involving them both in misery of the acutest
kind.''

 (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div><p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>Elizabeth</b></font>) paused, and saw with no slight indignation that he (<font color='blue'><b>Darcy</b></font>) was listening
with an air which proved him (<font color='blue'><b>Darcy</b></font>) wholly unmoved by any feeling of remorse.
He (<font color='blue'><b>Darcy</b></font>) even looked at her (<font color='blue'><b>Elizabeth</b></font>) with a smile of affected incredulity.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Can you deny that you have done it?''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Elizabeth</b></font>) repeated.

<p/>With assumed tranquillity he (<font color='blue'><b>Darcy</b></font>) then replied: <div class="bookquote">``I have no wish of denying
that I did everything in my power to separate my friend from your
sister, or that I rejoice in my success. Towards _him (<font color='blue'><b>friend</b></font>)_ I have been
kinder than towards myself.''

 (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div><p/>Elizabeth disdained the appearance of noticing this civil reflection,
but its meaning did not escape, nor was it likely to conciliate her (<font color='blue'><b>Elizabeth</b></font>).

<p/><div class="bookquote">``But it is not merely this affair,''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Elizabeth</b></font>) continued, <div class="bookquote">``on which my dislike
is founded. Long before it had taken place my opinion of you was
decided. Your character was unfolded in the recital which I received
many months ago from Mr. Wickham. On this subject, what can you have to
say? In what imaginary act of friendship can you here defend yourself?
or under what misrepresentation can you here impose upon others?''

 (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``You take an eager interest in that gentleman's concerns,''  (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Darcy/Darcy</b></font>)</div>said Darcy,
in a less tranquil tone, and with a heightened colour.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Who that knows what his (<font color='blue'><b>gentleman</b></font>) misfortunes have been, can help feeling an
interest in him (<font color='blue'><b>gentleman</b></font>)?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``His (<font color='blue'><b>gentleman</b></font>) misfortunes!''  (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Darcy/Darcy</b></font>)</div>repeated Darcy contemptuously; <div class="bookquote">``yes, his (<font color='blue'><b>gentleman</b></font>) misfortunes
have been great indeed.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Darcy/Darcy</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``And of your infliction,''  (<font color='red'><b>Elizabeth/Miss Bennet/Miss Elizabeth</b></font>)</div>cried Elizabeth with energy. <div class="bookquote">``You have reduced
him (<font color='blue'><b>gentleman</b></font>) to his (<font color='blue'><b>gentleman</b></font>) present state of poverty--comparative poverty. You have
withheld the advantages which you must know to have been designed for
him (<font color='blue'><b>gentleman</b></font>). You have deprived the best years of his (<font color='blue'><b>gentleman</b></font>) life of that independence
which was no less his (<font color='blue'><b>gentleman</b></font>) due than his (<font color='blue'><b>gentleman</b></font>) desert. You have done all this!
and yet you can treat the mention of his (<font color='blue'><b>gentleman</b></font>) misfortune with contempt and
ridicule.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``And this,''  (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Darcy/Darcy</b></font>)</div>cried Darcy, as he (<font color='blue'><b>Darcy</b></font>) walked with quick steps across the room,
<div class="bookquote">``is your opinion of me! This is the estimation in which you hold me!
I thank you for explaining it so fully. My faults, according to this
calculation, are heavy indeed! But perhaps,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>added he (<font color='blue'><b>Darcy</b></font>), stopping in
his (<font color='blue'><b>Darcy</b></font>) walk, and turning towards her (<font color='blue'><b>Elizabeth</b></font>), <div class="bookquote">``these offenses might have been
overlooked, had not your pride been hurt by my honest confession of the
scruples that had long prevented my forming any serious design. These
bitter accusations might have been suppressed, had I, with greater
policy, concealed my struggles, and flattered you into the belief of
my being impelled by unqualified, unalloyed inclination; by reason, by
reflection, by everything. But disguise of every sort is my abhorrence.
Nor am I ashamed of the feelings I related. They were natural and
just. Could you expect me to rejoice in the inferiority of your
connections?--to congratulate myself on the hope of relations, whose
condition in life is so decidedly beneath my own?''

 (<font color='red'><b>her</b></font>)</div><p/>Elizabeth felt herself growing more angry every moment; yet she (<font color='blue'><b>Elizabeth</b></font>) tried to
the utmost to speak with composure when she (<font color='blue'><b>Elizabeth</b></font>) said:

<p/><div class="bookquote">``You are mistaken, Mr. Darcy, if you suppose that the mode of your
declaration affected me in any other way, than as it spared me the concern
which I might have felt in refusing you, had you behaved in a more
gentlemanlike manner.''

 (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div><p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>Elizabeth</b></font>) saw him (<font color='blue'><b>Darcy</b></font>) start at this, but he (<font color='blue'><b>Darcy</b></font>) said nothing, and she (<font color='blue'><b>Elizabeth</b></font>) continued:

<p/><div class="bookquote">``You could not have made the offer of your hand in any possible way that
would have tempted me to accept it.''

 (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div><p/>Again his (<font color='blue'><b>Darcy</b></font>) astonishment was obvious; and he (<font color='blue'><b>Darcy</b></font>) looked at her (<font color='blue'><b>Elizabeth</b></font>) with an
expression of mingled incredulity and mortification. She (<font color='blue'><b>Elizabeth</b></font>) went on:

<p/><div class="bookquote">``From the very beginning--from the first moment, I may almost say--of
my acquaintance with you, your manners, impressing me with the fullest
belief of your arrogance, your conceit, and your selfish disdain of
the feelings of others, were such as to form the groundwork of
disapprobation on which succeeding events have built so immovable a
dislike; and I had not known you a month before I felt that you were the
last man in the world whom I could ever be prevailed on to marry.''

 (<font color='red'><b>She</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``You have said quite enough, madam. I perfectly comprehend your
feelings, and have now only to be ashamed of what my own have been.
Forgive me for having taken up so much of your time, and accept my best
wishes for your health and happiness.''

 (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div><p/>And with these words he (<font color='blue'><b>Darcy</b></font>) hastily left the room, and Elizabeth heard him (<font color='blue'><b>Darcy</b></font>)
the next moment open the front door and quit the house.

<p/>The tumult of her (<font color='blue'><b>Elizabeth</b></font>) mind, was now painfully great. She (<font color='blue'><b>Elizabeth</b></font>) knew not how
to support herself, and from actual weakness sat down and cried for
half-an-hour. Her (<font color='blue'><b>Elizabeth</b></font>) astonishment, as she (<font color='blue'><b>Elizabeth</b></font>) reflected on what had passed,
was increased by every review of it. That she (<font color='blue'><b>Elizabeth</b></font>) should receive an offer of
marriage from Mr. Darcy! That he (<font color='blue'><b>Darcy</b></font>) should have been in love with her (<font color='blue'><b>Elizabeth</b></font>) for
so many months! So much in love as to wish to marry her (<font color='blue'><b>Elizabeth</b></font>) in spite of
all the objections which had made him (<font color='blue'><b>Darcy</b></font>) prevent his (<font color='blue'><b>Darcy</b></font>) friend's marrying
her (<font color='blue'><b>Elizabeth</b></font>) sister, and which must appear at least with equal force in his (<font color='blue'><b>Darcy</b></font>)
own case--was almost incredible! It was gratifying to have inspired
unconsciously so strong an affection. But his (<font color='blue'><b>Darcy</b></font>) pride, his (<font color='blue'><b>Darcy</b></font>) abominable
pride--his (<font color='blue'><b>Darcy</b></font>) shameless avowal of what he (<font color='blue'><b>Darcy</b></font>) had done with respect to
Jane--his (<font color='blue'><b>Darcy</b></font>) unpardonable assurance in acknowledging, though he (<font color='blue'><b>Darcy</b></font>) could
not justify it, and the unfeeling manner in which he (<font color='blue'><b>Darcy</b></font>) had mentioned Mr.
Wickham, his (<font color='blue'><b>Darcy</b></font>) cruelty towards whom he (<font color='blue'><b>Darcy</b></font>) had not attempted to deny, soon
overcame the pity which the consideration of his (<font color='blue'><b>Darcy</b></font>) attachment had for
a moment excited. She (<font color='blue'><b>Jane</b></font>) continued in very agitated reflections till the
sound of Lady Catherine's carriage made her (<font color='blue'><b>Catherine</b></font>) feel how unequal she (<font color='blue'><b>Catherine</b></font>) was to
encounter Charlotte's observation, and hurried her (<font color='blue'><b>Catherine</b></font>) away to her (<font color='blue'><b>Catherine</b></font>) room.



<p/>Chapter 35


<p/>Elizabeth awoke the next morning to the same thoughts and meditations
which had at length closed her (<font color='blue'><b>Elizabeth</b></font>) eyes. She (<font color='blue'><b>Elizabeth</b></font>) could not yet recover from the
surprise of what had happened; it was impossible to think of anything
else; and, totally indisposed for employment, she (<font color='blue'><b>Elizabeth</b></font>) resolved, soon after
breakfast, to indulge herself in air and exercise. She (<font color='blue'><b>Elizabeth</b></font>) was proceeding
directly to her (<font color='blue'><b>Elizabeth</b></font>) favourite walk, when the recollection of Mr. Darcy's
sometimes coming there stopped her (<font color='blue'><b>Elizabeth</b></font>), and instead of entering the park,
she (<font color='blue'><b>Elizabeth</b></font>) turned up the lane, which led farther from the turnpike-road. The
park paling was still the boundary on one side, and she (<font color='blue'><b>Elizabeth</b></font>) soon passed one
of the gates into the ground.

<p/>After walking two or three times along that part of the lane, she (<font color='blue'><b>Elizabeth</b></font>) was
tempted, by the pleasantness of the morning, to stop at the gates and
look into the park. The five weeks which she (<font color='blue'><b>Elizabeth</b></font>) had now passed in Kent had
made a great difference in the country, and every day was adding to the
verdure of the early trees. She (<font color='blue'><b>Elizabeth</b></font>) was on the point of continuing her (<font color='blue'><b>Elizabeth</b></font>) walk,
when she (<font color='blue'><b>Elizabeth</b></font>) caught a glimpse of a gentleman within the sort of grove which
edged the park; he (<font color='blue'><b>gentleman</b></font>) was moving that way; and, fearful of its being Mr.
Darcy, she (<font color='blue'><b>Elizabeth</b></font>) was directly retreating. But the person who advanced was now
near enough to see her (<font color='blue'><b>Elizabeth</b></font>), and stepping forward with eagerness, pronounced
her (<font color='blue'><b>Elizabeth</b></font>) name. She (<font color='blue'><b>Elizabeth</b></font>) had turned away; but on hearing herself called, though
in a voice which proved it to be Mr. Darcy, she (<font color='blue'><b>Elizabeth</b></font>) moved again towards the
gate. He (<font color='blue'><b>Darcy</b></font>) had by that time reached it also, and, holding out a letter,
which she (<font color='blue'><b>Elizabeth</b></font>) instinctively took, said, with a look of haughty composure,
<div class="bookquote">``I have been walking in the grove some time in the hope of meeting you.
Will you do me the honour of reading that letter?''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>And then, with a
slight bow, turned again into the plantation, and was soon out of sight.

<p/>With no expectation of pleasure, but with the strongest curiosity,
Elizabeth opened the letter, and, to her (<font color='blue'><b>Elizabeth</b></font>) still increasing wonder,
perceived an envelope containing two sheets of letter-paper, written
quite through, in a very close hand. The envelope itself was likewise
full. Pursuing her (<font color='blue'><b>Elizabeth</b></font>) way along the lane, she (<font color='blue'><b>Elizabeth</b></font>) then began it. It was dated
from Rosings, at eight o'clock in the morning, and was as follows:--

<p/>``Be not alarmed, madam, on receiving this letter, by the apprehension
of its containing any repetition of those sentiments or renewal of those
offers which were last night so disgusting to you. I write without any
intention of paining you, or humbling myself, by dwelling on wishes
which, for the happiness of both, cannot be too soon forgotten; and the
effort which the formation and the perusal of this letter must occasion,
should have been spared, had not my character required it to be written
and read. You must, therefore, pardon the freedom with which I demand
your attention; your feelings, I know, will bestow it unwillingly, but I
demand it of your justice.

<p/>``Two offenses of a very different nature, and by no means of equal
magnitude, you last night laid to my charge. The first mentioned was,
that, regardless of the sentiments of either, I had detached Mr. Bingley
from your sister, and the other, that I had, in defiance of various
claims, in defiance of honour and humanity, ruined the immediate
prosperity and blasted the prospects of Mr. Wickham. Wilfully and
wantonly to have thrown off the companion of my youth, the acknowledged
favourite of my father, a young man who had scarcely any other
dependence than on our patronage, and who had been brought up to expect
its exertion, would be a depravity, to which the separation of two young
persons, whose affection could be the growth of only a few weeks, could
bear no comparison. But from the severity of that blame which was last
night so liberally bestowed, respecting each circumstance, I shall hope
to be in the future secured, when the following account of my actions
and their motives has been read. If, in the explanation of them, which
is due to myself, I am under the necessity of relating feelings which
may be offensive to yours, I can only say that I am sorry. The necessity
must be obeyed, and further apology would be absurd.

<p/>``I had not been long in Hertfordshire, before I saw, in common with
others, that Bingley preferred your elder sister to any other young
woman in the country. But it was not till the evening of the dance
at Netherfield that I had any apprehension of his (<font color='blue'><b>Bingley</b></font>) feeling a serious
attachment. I had often seen him (<font color='blue'><b>Bingley</b></font>) in love before. At that ball, while I
had the honour of dancing with you, I was first made acquainted, by Sir
William Lucas's accidental information, that Bingley's attentions to
your sister had given rise to a general expectation of their marriage.
He (<font color='blue'><b>Bingley</b></font>) spoke of it as a certain event, of which the time alone could
be undecided. From that moment I observed my friend's behaviour
attentively; and I could then perceive that his (<font color='blue'><b>friend</b></font>) partiality for Miss
Bennet was beyond what I had ever witnessed in him (<font color='blue'><b>friend</b></font>). Your sister I also
watched. Her (<font color='blue'><b>sister</b></font>) look and manners were open, cheerful, and engaging as ever,
but without any symptom of peculiar regard, and I remained convinced
from the evening's scrutiny, that though she (<font color='blue'><b>sister</b></font>) received his (<font color='blue'><b>friend</b></font>) attentions
with pleasure, she (<font color='blue'><b>sister</b></font>) did not invite them by any participation of
sentiment. If _you_ have not been mistaken here, _I_ must have been
in error. Your superior knowledge of your sister must make the latter
probable. If it be so, if I have been misled by such error to inflict
pain on her (<font color='blue'><b>sister</b></font>), your resentment has not been unreasonable. But I shall not
scruple to assert, that the serenity of your sister's countenance and
air was such as might have given the most acute observer a conviction
that, however amiable her (<font color='blue'><b>sister</b></font>) temper, her (<font color='blue'><b>sister</b></font>) heart was not likely to be
easily touched. That I was desirous of believing her (<font color='blue'><b>sister</b></font>) indifferent is
certain--but I will venture to say that my investigation and decisions
are not usually influenced by my hopes or fears. I did not believe
her (<font color='blue'><b>sister</b></font>) to be indifferent because I wished it; I believed it on impartial
conviction, as truly as I wished it in reason. My objections to the
marriage were not merely those which I last night acknowledged to have
the utmost force of passion to put aside, in my own case; the want of
connection could not be so great an evil to my friend as to me. But
there were other causes of repugnance; causes which, though still
existing, and existing to an equal degree in both instances, I had
myself endeavoured to forget, because they were not immediately before
me. These causes must be stated, though briefly. The situation of your
mother's family, though objectionable, was nothing in comparison to that
total want of propriety so frequently, so almost uniformly betrayed by
herself, by your three younger sisters, and occasionally even by your
father. Pardon me. It pains me to offend you. But amidst your concern
for the defects of your nearest relations, and your displeasure at this
representation of them, let it give you consolation to consider that, to
have conducted yourselves so as to avoid any share of the like censure,
is praise no less generally bestowed on you and your elder sister, than
it is honourable to the sense and disposition of both. I will only say
farther that from what passed that evening, my opinion of all parties
was confirmed, and every inducement heightened which could have led
me before, to preserve my friend from what I esteemed a most unhappy
connection. He (<font color='blue'><b>friend</b></font>) left Netherfield for London, on the day following, as
you, I am certain, remember, with the design of soon returning.

<p/>``The part which I acted is now to be explained. His (<font color='blue'><b>friend</b></font>) sisters' uneasiness
had been equally excited with my own; our coincidence of feeling was
soon discovered, and, alike sensible that no time was to be lost in
detaching their brother, we shortly resolved on joining him (<font color='blue'><b>brother</b></font>) directly in
London. We accordingly went--and there I readily engaged in the office
of pointing out to my friend the certain evils of such a choice. I
described, and enforced them earnestly. But, however this remonstrance
might have staggered or delayed his (<font color='blue'><b>friend</b></font>) determination, I do not suppose
that it would ultimately have prevented the marriage, had it not been
seconded by the assurance that I hesitated not in giving, of your
sister's indifference. He (<font color='blue'><b>friend</b></font>) had before believed her (<font color='blue'><b>sister</b></font>) to return his (<font color='blue'><b>friend</b></font>)
affection with sincere, if not with equal regard. But Bingley has great
natural modesty, with a stronger dependence on my judgement than on his (<font color='blue'><b>Bingley</b></font>)
own. To convince him (<font color='blue'><b>Bingley</b></font>), therefore, that he (<font color='blue'><b>Bingley</b></font>) had deceived himself, was
no very difficult point. To persuade him (<font color='blue'><b>Bingley</b></font>) against returning into
Hertfordshire, when that conviction had been given, was scarcely the
work of a moment. I cannot blame myself for having done thus much. There
is but one part of my conduct in the whole affair on which I do not
reflect with satisfaction; it is that I condescended to adopt the
measures of art so far as to conceal from him (<font color='blue'><b>Bingley</b></font>) your sister's being in
town. I knew it myself, as it was known to Miss Bingley; but her (<font color='blue'><b>Bingley</b></font>)
brother is even yet ignorant of it. That they might have met without
ill consequence is perhaps probable; but his (<font color='blue'><b>brother</b></font>) regard did not appear to me
enough extinguished for him (<font color='blue'><b>brother</b></font>) to see her (<font color='blue'><b>Bingley</b></font>) without some danger. Perhaps this
concealment, this disguise was beneath me; it is done, however, and it
was done for the best. On this subject I have nothing more to say, no
other apology to offer. If I have wounded your sister's feelings, it
was unknowingly done and though the motives which governed me may to
you very naturally appear insufficient, I have not yet learnt to condemn
them.

<p/>``With respect to that other, more weighty accusation, of having injured
Mr. Wickham, I can only refute it by laying before you the whole of his (<font color='blue'><b>Wickham</b></font>)
connection with my family. Of what he (<font color='blue'><b>Wickham</b></font>) has _particularly_ accused me I
am ignorant; but of the truth of what I shall relate, I can summon more
than one witness of undoubted veracity.

<p/>``Mr. Wickham is the son of a very respectable man, who had for many
years the management of all the Pemberley estates, and whose good
conduct in the discharge of his (<font color='blue'><b>Wickham</b></font>) trust naturally inclined my father to
be of service to him (<font color='blue'><b>Wickham</b></font>); and on George Wickham, who was his (<font color='blue'><b>Wickham</b></font>) godson, his (<font color='blue'><b>Wickham</b></font>)
kindness was therefore liberally bestowed. My father supported him (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) at
school, and afterwards at Cambridge--most important assistance, as his (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>)
own father, always poor from the extravagance of his (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) wife, would have
been unable to give him (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) a gentleman's education. My father was not only
fond of this young man's society, whose manners were always engaging; he (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>)
had also the highest opinion of him (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>), and hoping the church would be
his (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) profession, intended to provide for him (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) in it. As for myself, it is
many, many years since I first began to think of him (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) in a very different
manner. The vicious propensities--the want of principle, which he (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) was
careful to guard from the knowledge of his (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) best friend, could not escape
the observation of a young man of nearly the same age with himself,
and who had opportunities of seeing him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) in unguarded moments, which Mr.
Darcy could not have. Here again I shall give you pain--to what degree
you only can tell. But whatever may be the sentiments which Mr. Wickham
has created, a suspicion of their nature shall not prevent me from
unfolding his (<font color='blue'><b>Wickham</b></font>) real character--it adds even another motive.

<p/>``My excellent father died about five years ago; and his (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) attachment to
Mr. Wickham was to the last so steady, that in his (<font color='blue'><b>Wickham</b></font>) will he (<font color='blue'><b>Wickham</b></font>) particularly
recommended it to me, to promote his (<font color='blue'><b>Wickham</b></font>) advancement in the best manner
that his (<font color='blue'><b>Wickham</b></font>) profession might allow--and if he (<font color='blue'><b>Wickham</b></font>) took orders, desired that a
valuable family living might be his (<font color='blue'><b>Wickham</b></font>) as soon as it became vacant. There
was also a legacy of one thousand pounds. His (<font color='blue'><b>Wickham</b></font>) own father did not long
survive mine, and within half a year from these events, Mr. Wickham
wrote to inform me that, having finally resolved against taking orders,
he (<font color='blue'><b>Wickham</b></font>) hoped I should not think it unreasonable for him (<font color='blue'><b>Wickham</b></font>) to expect some more
immediate pecuniary advantage, in lieu of the preferment, by which he (<font color='blue'><b>Wickham</b></font>)
could not be benefited. He (<font color='blue'><b>Wickham</b></font>) had some intention, he (<font color='blue'><b>Wickham</b></font>) added, of studying
law, and I must be aware that the interest of one thousand pounds would
be a very insufficient support therein. I rather wished, than believed
him (<font color='blue'><b>Wickham</b></font>) to be sincere; but, at any rate, was perfectly ready to accede to
his (<font color='blue'><b>Wickham</b></font>) proposal. I knew that Mr. Wickham ought not to be a clergyman; the
business was therefore soon settled--he (<font color='blue'><b>Wickham</b></font>) resigned all claim to assistance
in the church, were it possible that he (<font color='blue'><b>Wickham</b></font>) could ever be in a situation to
receive it, and accepted in return three thousand pounds. All connection
between us seemed now dissolved. I thought too ill of him (<font color='blue'><b>Wickham</b></font>) to invite him (<font color='blue'><b>Wickham</b></font>)
to Pemberley, or admit his (<font color='blue'><b>Wickham</b></font>) society in town. In town I believe he (<font color='blue'><b>Wickham</b></font>) chiefly
lived, but his (<font color='blue'><b>Wickham</b></font>) studying the law was a mere pretence, and being now free
from all restraint, his (<font color='blue'><b>Wickham</b></font>) life was a life of idleness and dissipation.
For about three years I heard little of him (<font color='blue'><b>Wickham</b></font>); but on the decease of the
incumbent of the living which had been designed for him (<font color='blue'><b>Wickham</b></font>), he (<font color='blue'><b>Wickham</b></font>) applied to
me again by letter for the presentation. His (<font color='blue'><b>Wickham</b></font>) circumstances, he (<font color='blue'><b>Wickham</b></font>) assured
me, and I had no difficulty in believing it, were exceedingly bad. He (<font color='blue'><b>Wickham</b></font>)
had found the law a most unprofitable study, and was now absolutely
resolved on being ordained, if I would present him (<font color='blue'><b>Wickham</b></font>) to the living in
question--of which he (<font color='blue'><b>Wickham</b></font>) trusted there could be little doubt, as he (<font color='blue'><b>Wickham</b></font>) was
well assured that I had no other person to provide for, and I could not
have forgotten my revered father's intentions. You will hardly blame
me for refusing to comply with this entreaty, or for resisting every
repetition to it. His (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) resentment was in proportion to the distress of
his (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) circumstances--and he (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) was doubtless as violent in his (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) abuse of me
to others as in his (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) reproaches to myself. After this period every
appearance of acquaintance was dropped. How he (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) lived I know not. But
last summer he (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) was again most painfully obtruded on my notice.

<p/>``I must now mention a circumstance which I would wish to forget myself,
and which no obligation less than the present should induce me to unfold
to any human being. Having said thus much, I feel no doubt of your
secrecy. My sister, who is more than ten years my junior, was left to
the guardianship of my mother's nephew, Colonel Fitzwilliam, and myself.
About a year ago, she (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) was taken from school, and an establishment formed
for her (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) in London; and last summer she (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) went with the lady who presided
over it, to Ramsgate; and thither also went Mr. Wickham, undoubtedly by
design; for there proved to have been a prior acquaintance between him (<font color='blue'><b>acquaintance</b></font>)
and Mrs. Younge, in whose character we were most unhappily deceived; and
by her (<font color='blue'><b>Younge</b></font>) connivance and aid, he (<font color='blue'><b>acquaintance</b></font>) so far recommended himself to Georgiana,
whose affectionate heart retained a strong impression of his (<font color='blue'><b>acquaintance</b></font>) kindness to
her (<font color='blue'><b>Georgiana</b></font>) as a child, that she (<font color='blue'><b>Georgiana</b></font>) was persuaded to believe herself in love, and
to consent to an elopement. She (<font color='blue'><b>Georgiana</b></font>) was then but fifteen, which must be her (<font color='blue'><b>Georgiana</b></font>)
excuse; and after stating her (<font color='blue'><b>Georgiana</b></font>) imprudence, I am happy to add, that I owed
the knowledge of it to herself. I joined them unexpectedly a day or two
before the intended elopement, and then Georgiana, unable to support the
idea of grieving and offending a brother whom she (<font color='blue'><b>Georgiana</b></font>) almost looked up to as
a father, acknowledged the whole to me. You may imagine what I felt and
how I acted. Regard for my sister's credit and feelings prevented
any public exposure; but I wrote to Mr. Wickham, who left the place
immediately, and Mrs. Younge was of course removed from her (<font color='blue'><b>Younge</b></font>) charge. Mr.
Wickham's chief object was unquestionably my sister's fortune, which
is thirty thousand pounds; but I cannot help supposing that the hope of
revenging himself on me was a strong inducement. His (<font color='blue'><b>Wickham</b></font>) revenge would have
been complete indeed.

<p/>``This, madam, is a faithful narrative of every event in which we have
been concerned together; and if you do not absolutely reject it as
false, you will, I hope, acquit me henceforth of cruelty towards Mr.
Wickham. I know not in what manner, under what form of falsehood he (<font color='blue'><b>Wickham</b></font>)
had imposed on you; but his (<font color='blue'><b>Wickham</b></font>) success is not perhaps to be wondered
at. Ignorant as you previously were of everything concerning either,
detection could not be in your power, and suspicion certainly not in
your inclination.

<p/>``You may possibly wonder why all this was not told you last night; but
I was not then master enough of myself to know what could or ought to
be revealed. For the truth of everything here related, I can appeal more
particularly to the testimony of Colonel Fitzwilliam, who, from our
near relationship and constant intimacy, and, still more, as one of
the executors of my father's will, has been unavoidably acquainted
with every particular of these transactions. If your abhorrence of _me_
should make _my_ assertions valueless, you cannot be prevented by
the same cause from confiding in my cousin; and that there may be
the possibility of consulting him (<font color='blue'><b>cousin</b></font>), I shall endeavour to find some
opportunity of putting this letter in your hands in the course of the
morning. I will only add, God bless you.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``FITZWILLIAM DARCY''



 (<font color='red'><b>Elizabeth/Miss Bennet/Miss Elizabeth</b></font>)</div><p/>Chapter 36


<p/>If Elizabeth, when Mr. Darcy gave her (<font color='blue'><b>Elizabeth</b></font>) the letter, did not expect it to
contain a renewal of his (<font color='blue'><b>Darcy</b></font>) offers, she (<font color='blue'><b>Elizabeth</b></font>) had formed no expectation at all of
its contents. But such as they were, it may well be supposed how eagerly
she (<font color='blue'><b>Elizabeth</b></font>) went through them, and what a contrariety of emotion they excited.
Her (<font color='blue'><b>Elizabeth</b></font>) feelings as she (<font color='blue'><b>Elizabeth</b></font>) read were scarcely to be defined. With amazement did
she (<font color='blue'><b>Elizabeth</b></font>) first understand that he (<font color='blue'><b>Darcy</b></font>) believed any apology to be in his (<font color='blue'><b>Darcy</b></font>) power;
and steadfastly was she (<font color='blue'><b>Elizabeth</b></font>) persuaded, that he (<font color='blue'><b>Darcy</b></font>) could have no explanation
to give, which a just sense of shame would not conceal. With a strong
prejudice against everything he (<font color='blue'><b>Darcy</b></font>) might say, she (<font color='blue'><b>Elizabeth</b></font>) began his (<font color='blue'><b>Darcy</b></font>) account of what
had happened at Netherfield. She (<font color='blue'><b>Elizabeth</b></font>) read with an eagerness which hardly
left her (<font color='blue'><b>Elizabeth</b></font>) power of comprehension, and from impatience of knowing what the
next sentence might bring, was incapable of attending to the sense of
the one before her (<font color='blue'><b>Elizabeth</b></font>) eyes. His (<font color='blue'><b>Darcy</b></font>) belief of her (<font color='blue'><b>Elizabeth</b></font>) sister's insensibility she (<font color='blue'><b>Elizabeth</b></font>)
instantly resolved to be false; and his (<font color='blue'><b>Darcy</b></font>) account of the real, the worst
objections to the match, made her (<font color='blue'><b>Elizabeth</b></font>) too angry to have any wish of doing
him (<font color='blue'><b>Darcy</b></font>) justice. He (<font color='blue'><b>Darcy</b></font>) expressed no regret for what he (<font color='blue'><b>Darcy</b></font>) had done which satisfied
her (<font color='blue'><b>Elizabeth</b></font>); his (<font color='blue'><b>Darcy</b></font>) style was not penitent, but haughty. It was all pride and
insolence.

<p/>But when this subject was succeeded by his (<font color='blue'><b>Darcy</b></font>) account of Mr. Wickham--when
she (<font color='blue'><b>Elizabeth</b></font>) read with somewhat clearer attention a relation of events which,
if true, must overthrow every cherished opinion of his (<font color='blue'><b>Darcy</b></font>) worth, and which
bore so alarming an affinity to his (<font color='blue'><b>Darcy</b></font>) own history of himself--her (<font color='blue'><b>Elizabeth</b></font>)
feelings were yet more acutely painful and more difficult of definition.
Astonishment, apprehension, and even horror, oppressed her (<font color='blue'><b>Elizabeth</b></font>). She (<font color='blue'><b>Elizabeth</b></font>) wished
to discredit it entirely, repeatedly exclaiming, <div class="bookquote">``This must be false!
This cannot be! This must be the grossest falsehood!'' (<font color='red'><b>She</b></font>)</div>--and when she (<font color='blue'><b>Elizabeth</b></font>) had
gone through the whole letter, though scarcely knowing anything of the
last page or two, put it hastily away, protesting that she (<font color='blue'><b>Elizabeth</b></font>) would not
regard it, that she (<font color='blue'><b>Elizabeth</b></font>) would never look in it again.

<p/>In this perturbed state of mind, with thoughts that could rest on
nothing, she (<font color='blue'><b>Elizabeth</b></font>) walked on; but it would not do; in half a minute the letter
was unfolded again, and collecting herself as well as she (<font color='blue'><b>Elizabeth</b></font>) could, she (<font color='blue'><b>Elizabeth</b></font>)
again began the mortifying perusal of all that related to Wickham, and
commanded herself so far as to examine the meaning of every sentence.
The account of his (<font color='blue'><b>Wickham</b></font>) connection with the Pemberley family was exactly what
he (<font color='blue'><b>Wickham</b></font>) had related himself; and the kindness of the late Mr. Darcy, though
she (<font color='blue'><b>Elizabeth</b></font>) had not before known its extent, agreed equally well with his (<font color='blue'><b>Darcy</b></font>) own
words. So far each recital confirmed the other; but when she (<font color='blue'><b>Elizabeth</b></font>) came to the
will, the difference was great. What Wickham had said of the living
was fresh in her (<font color='blue'><b>Elizabeth</b></font>) memory, and as she (<font color='blue'><b>Elizabeth</b></font>) recalled his (<font color='blue'><b>Wickham</b></font>) very words, it was
impossible not to feel that there was gross duplicity on one side or the
other; and, for a few moments, she (<font color='blue'><b>Elizabeth</b></font>) flattered herself that her (<font color='blue'><b>Elizabeth</b></font>) wishes did
not err. But when she (<font color='blue'><b>Elizabeth</b></font>) read and re-read with the closest attention, the
particulars immediately following of Wickham's resigning all pretensions
to the living, of his (<font color='blue'><b>Wickham</b></font>) receiving in lieu so considerable a sum as three
thousand pounds, again was she (<font color='blue'><b>Elizabeth</b></font>) forced to hesitate. She (<font color='blue'><b>Elizabeth</b></font>) put down
the letter, weighed every circumstance with what she (<font color='blue'><b>Elizabeth</b></font>) meant to be
impartiality--deliberated on the probability of each statement--but with
little success. On both sides it was only assertion. Again she (<font color='blue'><b>Elizabeth</b></font>) read
on; but every line proved more clearly that the affair, which she (<font color='blue'><b>Elizabeth</b></font>) had
believed it impossible that any contrivance could so represent as to
render Mr. Darcy's conduct in it less than infamous, was capable of a
turn which must make him (<font color='blue'><b>Darcy</b></font>) entirely blameless throughout the whole.

<p/>The extravagance and general profligacy which he (<font color='blue'><b>Darcy</b></font>) scrupled not to lay at
Mr. Wickham's charge, exceedingly shocked her (<font color='blue'><b>Elizabeth</b></font>); the more so, as she (<font color='blue'><b>Elizabeth</b></font>) could
bring no proof of its injustice. She (<font color='blue'><b>Elizabeth</b></font>) had never heard of him (<font color='blue'><b>Wickham</b></font>) before his (<font color='blue'><b>Wickham</b></font>)
entrance into the --shire Militia, in which he (<font color='blue'><b>Wickham</b></font>) had engaged at the
persuasion of the young man who, on meeting him (<font color='blue'><b>Wickham</b></font>) accidentally in town,
had there renewed a slight acquaintance. Of his (<font color='blue'><b>acquaintance</b></font>) former way of life
nothing had been known in Hertfordshire but what he (<font color='blue'><b>acquaintance</b></font>) told himself. As
to his (<font color='blue'><b>acquaintance</b></font>) real character, had information been in her (<font color='blue'><b>Elizabeth</b></font>) power, she (<font color='blue'><b>Elizabeth</b></font>) had
never felt a wish of inquiring. His (<font color='blue'><b>acquaintance</b></font>) countenance, voice, and manner had
established him (<font color='blue'><b>acquaintance</b></font>) at once in the possession of every virtue. She (<font color='blue'><b>Elizabeth</b></font>) tried
to recollect some instance of goodness, some distinguished trait of
integrity or benevolence, that might rescue him (<font color='blue'><b>acquaintance</b></font>) from the attacks of
Mr. Darcy; or at least, by the predominance of virtue, atone for those
casual errors under which she (<font color='blue'><b>Elizabeth</b></font>) would endeavour to class what Mr. Darcy
had described as the idleness and vice of many years' continuance. But
no such recollection befriended her (<font color='blue'><b>Elizabeth</b></font>). She (<font color='blue'><b>Elizabeth</b></font>) could see him (<font color='blue'><b>Darcy</b></font>) instantly before
her (<font color='blue'><b>Elizabeth</b></font>), in every charm of air and address; but she (<font color='blue'><b>Elizabeth</b></font>) could remember no more
substantial good than the general approbation of the neighbourhood, and
the regard which his (<font color='blue'><b>Darcy</b></font>) social powers had gained him (<font color='blue'><b>Darcy</b></font>) in the mess. After
pausing on this point a considerable while, she (<font color='blue'><b>Elizabeth</b></font>) once more continued to
read. But, alas! the story which followed, of his (<font color='blue'><b>Darcy</b></font>) designs on Miss
Darcy, received some confirmation from what had passed between Colonel
Fitzwilliam and herself only the morning before; and at last she (<font color='blue'><b>Darcy</b></font>) was
referred for the truth of every particular to Colonel Fitzwilliam
himself--from whom she (<font color='blue'><b>Darcy</b></font>) had previously received the information of his (<font color='blue'><b>Colonel</b></font>)
near concern in all his (<font color='blue'><b>Colonel</b></font>) cousin's affairs, and whose character she (<font color='blue'><b>Darcy</b></font>) had no
reason to question. At one time she (<font color='blue'><b>Darcy</b></font>) had almost resolved on applying to
him (<font color='blue'><b>Colonel</b></font>), but the idea was checked by the awkwardness of the application, and
at length wholly banished by the conviction that Mr. Darcy would never
have hazarded such a proposal, if he (<font color='blue'><b>Darcy</b></font>) had not been well assured of his (<font color='blue'><b>Darcy</b></font>)
cousin's corroboration.

<p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>Darcy</b></font>) perfectly remembered everything that had passed in conversation
between Wickham and herself, in their first evening at Mr. Phillips's.
Many of his (<font color='blue'><b>Phillips</b></font>) expressions were still fresh in her (<font color='blue'><b>Darcy</b></font>) memory. She (<font color='blue'><b>Darcy</b></font>) was _now_
struck with the impropriety of such communications to a stranger, and
wondered it had escaped her (<font color='blue'><b>Darcy</b></font>) before. She (<font color='blue'><b>Darcy</b></font>) saw the indelicacy of putting
himself forward as he (<font color='blue'><b>stranger</b></font>) had done, and the inconsistency of his (<font color='blue'><b>stranger</b></font>) professions
with his (<font color='blue'><b>stranger</b></font>) conduct. She (<font color='blue'><b>Darcy</b></font>) remembered that he (<font color='blue'><b>stranger</b></font>) had boasted of having no fear
of seeing Mr. Darcy--that Mr. Darcy might leave the country, but that
_he (<font color='blue'><b>Darcy</b></font>)_ should stand his (<font color='blue'><b>Darcy</b></font>) ground; yet he (<font color='blue'><b>Darcy</b></font>) had avoided the Netherfield ball
the very next week. She (<font color='blue'><b>Darcy</b></font>) remembered also that, till the Netherfield
family had quitted the country, he (<font color='blue'><b>Darcy</b></font>) had told his (<font color='blue'><b>Darcy</b></font>) story to no one but
herself; but that after their removal it had been everywhere discussed;
that he (<font color='blue'><b>Darcy</b></font>) had then no reserves, no scruples in sinking Mr. Darcy's
character, though he (<font color='blue'><b>Darcy</b></font>) had assured her (<font color='blue'><b>Darcy</b></font>) that respect for the father would
always prevent his (<font color='blue'><b>Darcy</b></font>) exposing the son.

<p/>How differently did everything now appear in which he (<font color='blue'><b>Darcy</b></font>) was concerned!
His (<font color='blue'><b>Darcy</b></font>) attentions to Miss King were now the consequence of views solely and
hatefully mercenary; and the mediocrity of her (<font color='blue'><b>King</b></font>) fortune proved no longer
the moderation of his (<font color='blue'><b>Darcy</b></font>) wishes, but his (<font color='blue'><b>Darcy</b></font>) eagerness to grasp at anything.
His (<font color='blue'><b>Darcy</b></font>) behaviour to herself could now have had no tolerable motive; he (<font color='blue'><b>Darcy</b></font>) had
either been deceived with regard to her (<font color='blue'><b>King</b></font>) fortune, or had been gratifying
his (<font color='blue'><b>Darcy</b></font>) vanity by encouraging the preference which she (<font color='blue'><b>King</b></font>) believed she (<font color='blue'><b>King</b></font>) had most
incautiously shown. Every lingering struggle in his (<font color='blue'><b>Darcy</b></font>) favour grew fainter
and fainter; and in farther justification of Mr. Darcy, she (<font color='blue'><b>King</b></font>) could not
but allow that Mr. Bingley, when questioned by Jane, had long ago
asserted his (<font color='blue'><b>Bingley</b></font>) blamelessness in the affair; that proud and repulsive as
were his (<font color='blue'><b>Bingley</b></font>) manners, she (<font color='blue'><b>Jane</b></font>) had never, in the whole course of their
acquaintance--an acquaintance which had latterly brought them much
together, and given her (<font color='blue'><b>Jane</b></font>) a sort of intimacy with his (<font color='blue'><b>acquaintance</b></font>) ways--seen anything
that betrayed him (<font color='blue'><b>acquaintance</b></font>) to be unprincipled or unjust--anything that spoke him (<font color='blue'><b>acquaintance</b></font>)
of irreligious or immoral habits; that among his (<font color='blue'><b>acquaintance</b></font>) own connections he (<font color='blue'><b>acquaintance</b></font>) was
esteemed and valued--that even Wickham had allowed him (<font color='blue'><b>Wickham</b></font>) merit as a
brother, and that she (<font color='blue'><b>Jane</b></font>) had often heard him (<font color='blue'><b>Wickham</b></font>) speak so affectionately of his (<font color='blue'><b>Wickham</b></font>)
sister as to prove him (<font color='blue'><b>Wickham</b></font>) capable of _some_ amiable feeling; that had his (<font color='blue'><b>Wickham</b></font>)
actions been what Mr. Wickham represented them, so gross a violation of
everything right could hardly have been concealed from the world; and
that friendship between a person capable of it, and such an amiable man
as Mr. Bingley, was incomprehensible.

<p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>Jane</b></font>) grew absolutely ashamed of herself. Of neither Darcy nor Wickham
could she (<font color='blue'><b>Jane</b></font>) think without feeling she (<font color='blue'><b>Jane</b></font>) had been blind, partial, prejudiced,
absurd.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``How despicably I have acted!''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Jane</b></font>) cried; <div class="bookquote">``I, who have prided myself
on my discernment! I, who have valued myself on my abilities! who have
often disdained the generous candour of my sister, and gratified
my vanity in useless or blameable mistrust! How humiliating is this
discovery! Yet, how just a humiliation! Had I been in love, I could
not have been more wretchedly blind! But vanity, not love, has been my
folly. Pleased with the preference of one, and offended by the neglect
of the other, on the very beginning of our acquaintance, I have courted
prepossession and ignorance, and driven reason away, where either were
concerned. Till this moment I never knew myself.''

 (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div><p/>From herself to Jane--from Jane to Bingley, her (<font color='blue'><b>Jane</b></font>) thoughts were in a line
which soon brought to her (<font color='blue'><b>Jane</b></font>) recollection that Mr. Darcy's explanation
_there_ had appeared very insufficient, and she (<font color='blue'><b>Jane</b></font>) read it again. Widely
different was the effect of a second perusal. How could she (<font color='blue'><b>Jane</b></font>) deny that
credit to his (<font color='blue'><b>Darcy</b></font>) assertions in one instance, which she (<font color='blue'><b>Jane</b></font>) had been obliged to
give in the other? He (<font color='blue'><b>Darcy</b></font>) declared himself to be totally unsuspicious of her (<font color='blue'><b>Jane</b></font>)
sister's attachment; and she (<font color='blue'><b>Jane</b></font>) could not help remembering what Charlotte's
opinion had always been. Neither could she (<font color='blue'><b>Jane</b></font>) deny the justice of his (<font color='blue'><b>Darcy</b></font>)
description of Jane. She (<font color='blue'><b>Jane</b></font>) felt that Jane's feelings, though fervent, were
little displayed, and that there was a constant complacency in her (<font color='blue'><b>Jane</b></font>) air
and manner not often united with great sensibility.

<p/>When she (<font color='blue'><b>Jane</b></font>) came to that part of the letter in which her (<font color='blue'><b>Jane</b></font>) family were
mentioned in terms of such mortifying, yet merited reproach, her (<font color='blue'><b>Jane</b></font>) sense
of shame was severe. The justice of the charge struck her (<font color='blue'><b>Jane</b></font>) too forcibly
for denial, and the circumstances to which he (<font color='blue'><b>Darcy</b></font>) particularly alluded as
having passed at the Netherfield ball, and as confirming all his (<font color='blue'><b>Darcy</b></font>) first
disapprobation, could not have made a stronger impression on his (<font color='blue'><b>Darcy</b></font>) mind
than on hers.

<p/>The compliment to herself and her (<font color='blue'><b>Jane</b></font>) sister was not unfelt. It soothed,
but it could not console her (<font color='blue'><b>Jane</b></font>) for the contempt which had thus been
self-attracted by the rest of her (<font color='blue'><b>Jane</b></font>) family; and as she (<font color='blue'><b>Jane</b></font>) considered
that Jane's disappointment had in fact been the work of her (<font color='blue'><b>Jane</b></font>) nearest
relations, and reflected how materially the credit of both must be hurt
by such impropriety of conduct, she (<font color='blue'><b>Jane</b></font>) felt depressed beyond anything she (<font color='blue'><b>Jane</b></font>)
had ever known before.

<p/>After wandering along the lane for two hours, giving way to every
variety of thought--re-considering events, determining probabilities,
and reconciling herself, as well as she (<font color='blue'><b>Jane</b></font>) could, to a change so sudden and
so important, fatigue, and a recollection of her (<font color='blue'><b>Jane</b></font>) long absence, made
her (<font color='blue'><b>Jane</b></font>) at length return home; and she (<font color='blue'><b>Jane</b></font>) entered the house with the wish
of appearing cheerful as usual, and the resolution of repressing such
reflections as must make her (<font color='blue'><b>Jane</b></font>) unfit for conversation.

<p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>Jane</b></font>) was immediately told that the two gentlemen from Rosings had each
called during her (<font color='blue'><b>Jane</b></font>) absence; Mr. Darcy, only for a few minutes, to take
leave--but that Colonel Fitzwilliam had been sitting with them at least
an hour, hoping for her (<font color='blue'><b>Jane</b></font>) return, and almost resolving to walk after her (<font color='blue'><b>Jane</b></font>)
till she (<font color='blue'><b>Jane</b></font>) could be found. Elizabeth could but just _affect_ concern
in missing him (<font color='blue'><b>Colonel</b></font>); she (<font color='blue'><b>Jane</b></font>) really rejoiced at it. Colonel Fitzwilliam was no
longer an object; she (<font color='blue'><b>Jane</b></font>) could think only of her (<font color='blue'><b>Jane</b></font>) letter.



<p/>Chapter 37


<p/>The two gentlemen left Rosings the next morning, and Mr. Collins having
been in waiting near the lodges, to make them his (<font color='blue'><b>Collins</b></font>) parting obeisance, was
able to bring home the pleasing intelligence, of their appearing in very
good health, and in as tolerable spirits as could be expected, after the
melancholy scene so lately gone through at Rosings. To Rosings he (<font color='blue'><b>Collins</b></font>) then
hastened, to console Lady Catherine and her (<font color='blue'><b>Catherine</b></font>) daughter; and on his (<font color='blue'><b>Collins</b></font>) return
brought back, with great satisfaction, a message from her (<font color='blue'><b>Catherine</b></font>) ladyship,
importing that she (<font color='blue'><b>Catherine</b></font>) felt herself so dull as to make her (<font color='blue'><b>Catherine</b></font>) very desirous of
having them all to dine with her (<font color='blue'><b>Catherine</b></font>).

<p/>Elizabeth could not see Lady Catherine without recollecting that, had
she (<font color='blue'><b>Elizabeth</b></font>) chosen it, she (<font color='blue'><b>Elizabeth</b></font>) might by this time have been presented to her (<font color='blue'><b>Elizabeth</b></font>) as
her (<font color='blue'><b>Elizabeth</b></font>) future niece; nor could she (<font color='blue'><b>Elizabeth</b></font>) think, without a smile, of what her (<font color='blue'><b>Elizabeth</b></font>)
ladyship's indignation would have been. <div class="bookquote">``What would she (<font color='blue'><b>I</b></font>) have said? how
would she (<font color='blue'><b>I</b></font>) have behaved?''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>were questions with which she (<font color='blue'><b>Elizabeth</b></font>) amused herself.

<p/>Their first subject was the diminution of the Rosings party. <div class="bookquote">``I assure
you, I feel it exceedingly,''  (<font color='red'><b>Lady Catherine/Lady Catherine de Bourgh/Catherine</b></font>)</div>said Lady Catherine; <div class="bookquote">``I believe no one
feels the loss of friends so much as I do. But I am particularly
attached to these young men, and know them to be so much attached to
me! They were excessively sorry to go! But so they always are. The
dear Colonel rallied his (<font color='blue'><b>Colonel</b></font>) spirits tolerably till just at last; but Darcy
seemed to feel it most acutely, more, I think, than last year. His (<font color='blue'><b>Darcy</b></font>)
attachment to Rosings certainly increases.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Lady Catherine/Lady Catherine de Bourgh/Catherine</b></font>)</div><p/>Mr. Collins had a compliment, and an allusion to throw in here, which
were kindly smiled on by the mother and daughter.

<p/>Lady Catherine observed, after dinner, that Miss Bennet seemed out of
spirits, and immediately accounting for it by herself, by supposing that
she (<font color='blue'><b>Bennet</b></font>) did not like to go home again so soon, she (<font color='blue'><b>Bennet</b></font>) added:

<p/><div class="bookquote">``But if that is the case, you must write to your mother and beg that
you may stay a little longer. Mrs. Collins will be very glad of your
company, I am sure.''

 (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I am much obliged to your ladyship for your kind invitation,''  (<font color='red'><b>Elizabeth/Miss Bennet/Miss Elizabeth</b></font>)</div>replied
Elizabeth, <div class="bookquote">``but it is not in my power to accept it. I must be in town
next Saturday.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Elizabeth/Miss Bennet/Miss Elizabeth</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Why, at that rate, you will have been here only six weeks. I expected
you to stay two months. I told Mrs. Collins so before you came. There
can be no occasion for your going so soon. Mrs. Bennet could certainly
spare you for another fortnight.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``But my father cannot. He (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) wrote last week to hurry my return.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Oh! your father of course may spare you, if your mother can. Daughters
are never of so much consequence to a father. And if you will stay
another _month_ complete, it will be in my power to take one of you as
far as London, for I am going there early in June, for a week; and as
Dawson does not object to the barouche-box, there will be very good room
for one of you--and indeed, if the weather should happen to be cool, I
should not object to taking you both, as you are neither of you large.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``You are all kindness, madam; but I believe we must abide by our
original plan.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Lady Catherine/Lady Catherine de Bourgh/Catherine</b></font>)</div><p/>Lady Catherine seemed resigned. <div class="bookquote">``Mrs. Collins, you must send a servant
with them. You know I always speak my mind, and I cannot bear the idea
of two young women travelling post by themselves. It is highly improper.
You must contrive to send somebody. I have the greatest dislike in
the world to that sort of thing. Young women should always be properly
guarded and attended, according to their situation in life. When my
niece Georgiana went to Ramsgate last summer, I made a point of her (<font color='blue'><b>Georgiana</b></font>)
having two men-servants go with her (<font color='blue'><b>Georgiana</b></font>). Miss Darcy, the daughter of
Mr. Darcy, of Pemberley, and Lady Anne, could not have appeared with
propriety in a different manner. I am excessively attentive to all those
things. You must send John with the young ladies, Mrs. Collins. I
am glad it occurred to me to mention it; for it would really be
discreditable to _you_ to let them go alone.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``My uncle is to send a servant for us.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Oh! Your uncle! He (<font color='blue'><b>uncle</b></font>) keeps a man-servant, does he (<font color='blue'><b>uncle</b></font>)? I am very glad you
have somebody who thinks of these things. Where shall you change horses?
Oh! Bromley, of course. If you mention my name at the Bell, you will be
attended to.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Lady Catherine/Lady Catherine de Bourgh/Catherine</b></font>)</div><p/>Lady Catherine had many other questions to ask respecting their journey,
and as she (<font color='blue'><b>Catherine</b></font>) did not answer them all herself, attention was necessary,
which Elizabeth believed to be lucky for her (<font color='blue'><b>Elizabeth</b></font>); or, with a mind so
occupied, she (<font color='blue'><b>Elizabeth</b></font>) might have forgotten where she (<font color='blue'><b>Elizabeth</b></font>) was. Reflection must be
reserved for solitary hours; whenever she (<font color='blue'><b>Elizabeth</b></font>) was alone, she (<font color='blue'><b>Elizabeth</b></font>) gave way to it
as the greatest relief; and not a day went by without a solitary
walk, in which she (<font color='blue'><b>Elizabeth</b></font>) might indulge in all the delight of unpleasant
recollections.

<p/>Mr. Darcy's letter she (<font color='blue'><b>Elizabeth</b></font>) was in a fair way of soon knowing by heart. She (<font color='blue'><b>Elizabeth</b></font>)
studied every sentence; and her (<font color='blue'><b>Elizabeth</b></font>) feelings towards its writer were at
times widely different. When she (<font color='blue'><b>Elizabeth</b></font>) remembered the style of his (<font color='blue'><b>writer</b></font>) address,
she (<font color='blue'><b>Elizabeth</b></font>) was still full of indignation; but when she (<font color='blue'><b>Elizabeth</b></font>) considered how unjustly
she (<font color='blue'><b>Elizabeth</b></font>) had condemned and upbraided him (<font color='blue'><b>writer</b></font>), her (<font color='blue'><b>Elizabeth</b></font>) anger was turned against
herself; and his (<font color='blue'><b>writer</b></font>) disappointed feelings became the object of compassion.
His (<font color='blue'><b>writer</b></font>) attachment excited gratitude, his (<font color='blue'><b>writer</b></font>) general character respect; but she (<font color='blue'><b>Elizabeth</b></font>)
could not approve him (<font color='blue'><b>writer</b></font>); nor could she (<font color='blue'><b>Elizabeth</b></font>) for a moment repent her (<font color='blue'><b>Elizabeth</b></font>) refusal,
or feel the slightest inclination ever to see him (<font color='blue'><b>writer</b></font>) again. In her (<font color='blue'><b>Elizabeth</b></font>) own past
behaviour, there was a constant source of vexation and regret; and in
the unhappy defects of her (<font color='blue'><b>Elizabeth</b></font>) family, a subject of yet heavier chagrin.
They were hopeless of remedy. Her (<font color='blue'><b>Elizabeth</b></font>) father, contented with laughing at
them, would never exert himself to restrain the wild giddiness of his (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>)
youngest daughters; and her (<font color='blue'><b>Elizabeth</b></font>) mother, with manners so far from right
herself, was entirely insensible of the evil. Elizabeth had frequently
united with Jane in an endeavour to check the imprudence of Catherine
and Lydia; but while they were supported by their mother's indulgence,
what chance could there be of improvement? Catherine, weak-spirited,
irritable, and completely under Lydia's guidance, had been always
affronted by their advice; and Lydia, self-willed and careless, would
scarcely give them a hearing. They were ignorant, idle, and vain. While
there was an officer in Meryton, they would flirt with him (<font color='blue'><b>officer</b></font>); and while
Meryton was within a walk of Longbourn, they would be going there
forever.

<p/>Anxiety on Jane's behalf was another prevailing concern; and Mr. Darcy's
explanation, by restoring Bingley to all her (<font color='blue'><b>Jane</b></font>) former good opinion,
heightened the sense of what Jane had lost. His (<font color='blue'><b>Bingley</b></font>) affection was proved
to have been sincere, and his (<font color='blue'><b>Bingley</b></font>) conduct cleared of all blame, unless any
could attach to the implicitness of his (<font color='blue'><b>Bingley</b></font>) confidence in his (<font color='blue'><b>Bingley</b></font>) friend. How
grievous then was the thought that, of a situation so desirable in every
respect, so replete with advantage, so promising for happiness, Jane had
been deprived, by the folly and indecorum of her (<font color='blue'><b>Jane</b></font>) own family!

<p/>When to these recollections was added the development of Wickham's
character, it may be easily believed that the happy spirits which had
seldom been depressed before, were now so much affected as to make it
almost impossible for her (<font color='blue'><b>Jane</b></font>) to appear tolerably cheerful.

<p/>Their engagements at Rosings were as frequent during the last week of
her (<font color='blue'><b>Jane</b></font>) stay as they had been at first. The very last evening was spent
there; and her (<font color='blue'><b>Jane</b></font>) ladyship again inquired minutely into the particulars of
their journey, gave them directions as to the best method of packing,
and was so urgent on the necessity of placing gowns in the only right
way, that Maria thought herself obliged, on her (<font color='blue'><b>Maria</b></font>) return, to undo all the
work of the morning, and pack her (<font color='blue'><b>Maria</b></font>) trunk afresh.

<p/>When they parted, Lady Catherine, with great condescension, wished them
a good journey, and invited them to come to Hunsford again next year;
and Miss de Bourgh exerted herself so far as to curtsey and hold out her (<font color='blue'><b>Bourgh</b></font>)
hand to both.



<p/>Chapter 38


<p/>On Saturday morning Elizabeth and Mr. Collins met for breakfast a few
minutes before the others appeared; and he (<font color='blue'><b>Collins</b></font>) took the opportunity of
paying the parting civilities which he (<font color='blue'><b>Collins</b></font>) deemed indispensably necessary.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``I know not, Miss Elizabeth,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>said he (<font color='blue'><b>Collins</b></font>), <div class="bookquote">``whether Mrs. Collins has yet
expressed her (<font color='blue'><b>Collins</b></font>) sense of your kindness in coming to us; but I am very
certain you will not leave the house without receiving her (<font color='blue'><b>Collins</b></font>) thanks for
it. The favour of your company has been much felt, I assure you. We
know how little there is to tempt anyone to our humble abode. Our plain
manner of living, our small rooms and few domestics, and the little we
see of the world, must make Hunsford extremely dull to a young lady like
yourself; but I hope you will believe us grateful for the condescension,
and that we have done everything in our power to prevent your spending
your time unpleasantly.''

 (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div><p/>Elizabeth was eager with her (<font color='blue'><b>Elizabeth</b></font>) thanks and assurances of happiness. She (<font color='blue'><b>Elizabeth</b></font>)
had spent six weeks with great enjoyment; and the pleasure of being with
Charlotte, and the kind attentions she (<font color='blue'><b>Charlotte</b></font>) had received, must make _her (<font color='blue'><b>Charlotte</b></font>)_
feel the obliged. Mr. Collins was gratified, and with a more smiling
solemnity replied:

<p/><div class="bookquote">``It gives me great pleasure to hear that you have passed your time not
disagreeably. We have certainly done our best; and most fortunately
having it in our power to introduce you to very superior society, and,
from our connection with Rosings, the frequent means of varying the
humble home scene, I think we may flatter ourselves that your Hunsford
visit cannot have been entirely irksome. Our situation with regard to
Lady Catherine's family is indeed the sort of extraordinary advantage
and blessing which few can boast. You see on what a footing we are. You
see how continually we are engaged there. In truth I must acknowledge
that, with all the disadvantages of this humble parsonage, I should
not think anyone abiding in it an object of compassion, while they are
sharers of our intimacy at Rosings.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Collins</b></font>)</div><p/>Words were insufficient for the elevation of his (<font color='blue'><b>Collins</b></font>) feelings; and he (<font color='blue'><b>Collins</b></font>) was
obliged to walk about the room, while Elizabeth tried to unite civility
and truth in a few short sentences.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``You may, in fact, carry a very favourable report of us into
Hertfordshire, my dear cousin. I flatter myself at least that you will
be able to do so. Lady Catherine's great attentions to Mrs. Collins you
have been a daily witness of; and altogether I trust it does not appear
that your friend has drawn an unfortunate--but on this point it will be
as well to be silent. Only let me assure you, my dear Miss Elizabeth,
that I can from my heart most cordially wish you equal felicity in
marriage. My dear Charlotte and I have but one mind and one way of
thinking. There is in everything a most remarkable resemblance of
character and ideas between us. We seem to have been designed for each
other.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Elizabeth/Miss Bennet/Miss Elizabeth</b></font>)</div><p/>Elizabeth could safely say that it was a great happiness where that was
the case, and with equal sincerity could add, that she (<font color='blue'><b>Elizabeth</b></font>) firmly believed
and rejoiced in his (<font color='blue'><b>Collins</b></font>) domestic comforts. She (<font color='blue'><b>Elizabeth</b></font>) was not sorry, however, to
have the recital of them interrupted by the lady from whom they sprang.
Poor Charlotte! it was melancholy to leave her (<font color='blue'><b>Charlotte</b></font>) to such society! But she (<font color='blue'><b>Charlotte</b></font>)
had chosen it with her (<font color='blue'><b>Charlotte</b></font>) eyes open; and though evidently regretting that
her (<font color='blue'><b>Charlotte</b></font>) visitors were to go, she (<font color='blue'><b>Charlotte</b></font>) did not seem to ask for compassion. Her (<font color='blue'><b>Charlotte</b></font>)
home and her (<font color='blue'><b>Charlotte</b></font>) housekeeping, her (<font color='blue'><b>Charlotte</b></font>) parish and her (<font color='blue'><b>Charlotte</b></font>) poultry, and all their
dependent concerns, had not yet lost their charms.

<p/>At length the chaise arrived, the trunks were fastened on, the parcels
placed within, and it was pronounced to be ready. After an affectionate
parting between the friends, Elizabeth was attended to the carriage by
Mr. Collins, and as they walked down the garden he (<font color='blue'><b>Collins</b></font>) was commissioning her (<font color='blue'><b>Elizabeth</b></font>)
with his (<font color='blue'><b>Collins</b></font>) best respects to all her (<font color='blue'><b>Elizabeth</b></font>) family, not forgetting his (<font color='blue'><b>Collins</b></font>) thanks
for the kindness he (<font color='blue'><b>Collins</b></font>) had received at Longbourn in the winter, and his (<font color='blue'><b>Collins</b></font>)
compliments to Mr. and Mrs. Gardiner, though unknown. He (<font color='blue'><b>Collins</b></font>) then handed her (<font color='blue'><b>Gardiner</b></font>)
in, Maria followed, and the door was on the point of being closed,
when he (<font color='blue'><b>Collins</b></font>) suddenly reminded them, with some consternation, that they had
hitherto forgotten to leave any message for the ladies at Rosings.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``But,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Collins</b></font>) added, <div class="bookquote">``you will of course wish to have your humble respects
delivered to them, with your grateful thanks for their kindness to you
while you have been here.''

 (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div><p/>Elizabeth made no objection; the door was then allowed to be shut, and
the carriage drove off.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Good gracious!''  (<font color='red'><b>Maria/Maria Lucas</b></font>)</div>cried Maria, after a few minutes' silence, <div class="bookquote">``it seems
but a day or two since we first came! and yet how many things have
happened!''

 (<font color='red'><b>Maria/Maria Lucas</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``A great many indeed,''  (<font color='red'><b>companion</b></font>)</div>said her (<font color='blue'><b>Maria</b></font>) companion with a sigh.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``We have dined nine times at Rosings, besides drinking tea there twice!
How much I shall have to tell!''

 (<font color='red'><b>Elizabeth/Miss Bennet/Miss Elizabeth</b></font>)</div><p/>Elizabeth added privately, <div class="bookquote">``And how much I shall have to conceal!''

 (<font color='red'><b>Elizabeth/Miss Bennet/Miss Elizabeth</b></font>)</div><p/>Their journey was performed without much conversation, or any alarm; and
within four hours of their leaving Hunsford they reached Mr. Gardiner's
house, where they were to remain a few days.

<p/>Jane looked well, and Elizabeth had little opportunity of studying her (<font color='blue'><b>Elizabeth</b></font>)
spirits, amidst the various engagements which the kindness of her (<font color='blue'><b>Elizabeth</b></font>)
aunt had reserved for them. But Jane was to go home with her (<font color='blue'><b>Jane</b></font>), and at
Longbourn there would be leisure enough for observation.

<p/>It was not without an effort, meanwhile, that she (<font color='blue'><b>Jane</b></font>) could wait even for
Longbourn, before she (<font color='blue'><b>Jane</b></font>) told her (<font color='blue'><b>Jane</b></font>) sister of Mr. Darcy's proposals. To know
that she (<font color='blue'><b>Jane</b></font>) had the power of revealing what would so exceedingly astonish
Jane, and must, at the same time, so highly gratify whatever of her (<font color='blue'><b>Jane</b></font>) own
vanity she (<font color='blue'><b>Jane</b></font>) had not yet been able to reason away, was such a temptation
to openness as nothing could have conquered but the state of indecision
in which she (<font color='blue'><b>Jane</b></font>) remained as to the extent of what she (<font color='blue'><b>Jane</b></font>) should communicate;
and her (<font color='blue'><b>Jane</b></font>) fear, if she (<font color='blue'><b>Jane</b></font>) once entered on the subject, of being hurried
into repeating something of Bingley which might only grieve her (<font color='blue'><b>Jane</b></font>) sister
further.



<p/>Chapter 39


<p/>It was the second week in May, in which the three young ladies set out
together from Gracechurch Street for the town of --, in Hertfordshire;
and, as they drew near the appointed inn where Mr. Bennet's carriage
was to meet them, they quickly perceived, in token of the coachman's
punctuality, both Kitty and Lydia looking out of a dining-room up stairs.
These two girls had been above an hour in the place, happily employed
in visiting an opposite milliner, watching the sentinel on guard, and
dressing a salad and cucumber.

<p/>After welcoming their sisters, they triumphantly displayed a table set
out with such cold meat as an inn larder usually affords, exclaiming,
<div class="bookquote">``Is not this nice? Is not this an agreeable surprise?''

 (<font color='red'><b>sisters</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``And we mean to treat you all,''  (<font color='red'><b>Lydia/Miss Lydia/Miss Lydia Bennet</b></font>)</div>added Lydia, <div class="bookquote">``but you must lend us the
money, for we have just spent ours at the shop out there.''  (<font color='red'><b>Lydia/Miss Lydia/Miss Lydia Bennet</b></font>)</div>Then, showing
her (<font color='blue'><b>Lydia</b></font>) purchases--<div class="bookquote">``Look here, I have bought this bonnet. I do not think
it is very pretty; but I thought I might as well buy it as not. I shall
pull it to pieces as soon as I get home, and see if I can make it up any
better.''

 (<font color='red'><b>sisters</b></font>)</div><p/>And when her (<font color='blue'><b>Lydia</b></font>) sisters abused it as ugly, she (<font color='blue'><b>Lydia</b></font>) added, with perfect
unconcern, <div class="bookquote">``Oh! but there were two or three much uglier in the shop; and
when I have bought some prettier-coloured satin to trim it with fresh, I
think it will be very tolerable. Besides, it will not much signify what
one wears this summer, after the --shire have left Meryton, and they
are going in a fortnight.''

 (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Are they indeed!''  (<font color='red'><b>Elizabeth/Miss Bennet/Miss Elizabeth</b></font>)</div>cried Elizabeth, with the greatest satisfaction.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``They are going to be encamped near Brighton; and I do so want papa to
take us all there for the summer! It would be such a delicious scheme;
and I dare say would hardly cost anything at all. Mamma would like to
go too of all things! Only think what a miserable summer else we shall
have!''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Yes,''  (<font color='red'><b>Elizabeth/Miss Bennet/Miss Elizabeth</b></font>)</div>thought Elizabeth, <div class="bookquote">''_that_ would be a delightful scheme indeed,
and completely do for us at once. Good Heaven! Brighton, and a whole
campful of soldiers, to us, who have been overset already by one poor
regiment of militia, and the monthly balls of Meryton!''

 (<font color='red'><b>Elizabeth/Miss Bennet/Miss Elizabeth</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Now I have got some news for you,''  (<font color='red'><b>Lydia/Miss Lydia/Miss Lydia Bennet</b></font>)</div>said Lydia, as they sat down at
table. <div class="bookquote">``What do you think? It is excellent news--capital news--and about
a certain person we all like!''

 (<font color='red'><b>Jane</b></font>)</div><p/>Jane and Elizabeth looked at each other, and the waiter was told he (<font color='blue'><b>waiter</b></font>) need
not stay. Lydia laughed, and said:

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Aye, that is just like your formality and discretion. You thought the
waiter must not hear, as if he (<font color='blue'><b>waiter</b></font>) cared! I dare say he (<font color='blue'><b>waiter</b></font>) often hears worse
things said than I am going to say. But he (<font color='blue'><b>waiter</b></font>) is an ugly fellow! I am glad
he (<font color='blue'><b>waiter</b></font>) is gone. I never saw such a long chin in my life. Well, but now for
my news; it is about dear Wickham; too good for the waiter, is it not?
There is no danger of Wickham's marrying Mary King. There's for you! She (<font color='blue'><b>King</b></font>)
is gone down to her (<font color='blue'><b>King</b></font>) uncle at Liverpool: gone to stay. Wickham is safe.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Lydia/Miss Lydia/Miss Lydia Bennet</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``And Mary King is safe!''  (<font color='red'><b>Elizabeth/Miss Bennet/Miss Elizabeth</b></font>)</div>added Elizabeth; <div class="bookquote">``safe from a connection
imprudent as to fortune.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Elizabeth/Miss Bennet/Miss Elizabeth</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``She (<font color='blue'><b>King</b></font>) is a great fool for going away, if she (<font color='blue'><b>King</b></font>) liked him (<font color='blue'><b>fool</b></font>).''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``But I hope there is no strong attachment on either side,''  (<font color='red'><b>Jane</b></font>)</div>said Jane.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``I am sure there is not on _his (<font color='blue'><b>fool</b></font>)_. I will answer for it, he (<font color='blue'><b>fool</b></font>) never cared
three straws about her (<font color='blue'><b>King</b></font>)--who could about such a nasty little freckled
thing?''

 (<font color='red'><b>Elizabeth/Miss Bennet/Miss Elizabeth</b></font>)</div><p/>Elizabeth was shocked to think that, however incapable of such
coarseness of _expression_ herself, the coarseness of the _sentiment_
was little other than her (<font color='blue'><b>Elizabeth</b></font>) own breast had harboured and fancied liberal!

<p/>As soon as all had ate, and the elder ones paid, the carriage was
ordered; and after some contrivance, the whole party, with all their
boxes, work-bags, and parcels, and the unwelcome addition of Kitty's and
Lydia's purchases, were seated in it.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``How nicely we are all crammed in,''  (<font color='red'><b>Lydia/Miss Lydia/Miss Lydia Bennet</b></font>)</div>cried Lydia. <div class="bookquote">``I am glad I bought my
bonnet, if it is only for the fun of having another bandbox! Well, now
let us be quite comfortable and snug, and talk and laugh all the way
home. And in the first place, let us hear what has happened to you all
since you went away. Have you seen any pleasant men? Have you had any
flirting? I was in great hopes that one of you would have got a husband
before you came back. Jane will be quite an old maid soon, I declare.
She (<font color='blue'><b>Jane</b></font>) is almost three-and-twenty! Lord, how ashamed I should be of not
being married before three-and-twenty! My aunt Phillips wants you so to
get husbands, you can't think. She (<font color='blue'><b>Phillips</b></font>) says Lizzy had better have taken Mr.
Collins; but _I_ do not think there would have been any fun in it. Lord!
how I should like to be married before any of you; and then I would
chaperon you about to all the balls. Dear me! we had such a good piece
of fun the other day at Colonel Forster's. Kitty and me were to spend
the day there, and Mrs. Forster promised to have a little dance in the
evening; -LRB-by the bye, Mrs. Forster and me are _such_ friends!-RRB- and so
she (<font color='blue'><b>Forster</b></font>) asked the two Harringtons to come, but Harriet was ill, and so Pen
was forced to come by herself; and then, what do you think we did? We
dressed up Chamberlayne in woman's clothes on purpose to pass for a
lady, only think what fun! Not a soul knew of it, but Colonel and Mrs.
Forster, and Kitty and me, except my aunt, for we were forced to borrow
one of her (<font color='blue'><b>Kitty</b></font>) gowns; and you cannot imagine how well he (<font color='blue'><b>Colonel</b></font>) looked! When Denny,
and Wickham, and Pratt, and two or three more of the men came in, they
did not know him (<font color='blue'><b>Denny</b></font>) in the least. Lord! how I laughed! and so did Mrs.
Forster. I thought I should have died. And _that_ made the men suspect
something, and then they soon found out what was the matter.''

 (<font color='red'><b>parties jokes</b></font>)</div><p/>With such kinds of histories of their parties and good jokes, did
Lydia, assisted by Kitty's hints and additions, endeavour to amuse her (<font color='blue'><b>Lydia</b></font>)
companions all the way to Longbourn. Elizabeth listened as little as she (<font color='blue'><b>Elizabeth</b></font>)
could, but there was no escaping the frequent mention of Wickham's name.

<p/>Their reception at home was most kind. Mrs. Bennet rejoiced to see Jane
in undiminished beauty; and more than once during dinner did Mr. Bennet
say voluntarily to Elizabeth:

<p/><div class="bookquote">``I am glad you are come back, Lizzy.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Elizabeth/Miss Bennet/Miss Elizabeth</b></font>)</div><p/>Their party in the dining-room was large, for almost all the Lucases
came to meet Maria and hear the news; and various were the subjects that
occupied them: Lady Lucas was inquiring of Maria, after the welfare and
poultry of her (<font color='blue'><b>Lucas</b></font>) eldest daughter; Mrs. Bennet was doubly engaged, on one
hand collecting an account of the present fashions from Jane, who sat
some way below her (<font color='blue'><b>Jane</b></font>), and, on the other, retailing them all to the younger
Lucases; and Lydia, in a voice rather louder than any other person's,
was enumerating the various pleasures of the morning to anybody who
would hear her (<font color='blue'><b>Lydia</b></font>).

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Oh! Mary,''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>said she (<font color='blue'><b>Lydia</b></font>), <div class="bookquote">``I wish you had gone with us, for we had such fun!
As we went along, Kitty and I drew up the blinds, and pretended there
was nobody in the coach; and I should have gone so all the way, if Kitty
had not been sick; and when we got to the George, I do think we behaved
very handsomely, for we treated the other three with the nicest cold
luncheon in the world, and if you would have gone, we would have treated
you too. And then when we came away it was such fun! I thought we never
should have got into the coach. I was ready to die of laughter. And then
we were so merry all the way home! we talked and laughed so loud, that
anybody might have heard us ten miles off!''

 (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div><p/>To this Mary very gravely replied, <div class="bookquote">``Far be it from me, my dear sister,
to depreciate such pleasures! They would doubtless be congenial with the
generality of female minds. But I confess they would have no charms for
_me_--I should infinitely prefer a book.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Mary/Mary King</b></font>)</div><p/>But of this answer Lydia heard not a word. She (<font color='blue'><b>Lydia</b></font>) seldom listened to
anybody for more than half a minute, and never attended to Mary at all.

<p/>In the afternoon Lydia was urgent with the rest of the girls to walk
to Meryton, and to see how everybody went on; but Elizabeth steadily
opposed the scheme. It should not be said that the Miss Bennets could
not be at home half a day before they were in pursuit of the officers.
There was another reason too for her (<font color='blue'><b>Bennets</b></font>) opposition. She (<font color='blue'><b>Bennets</b></font>) dreaded seeing Mr.
Wickham again, and was resolved to avoid it as long as possible. The
comfort to _her (<font color='blue'><b>Bennets</b></font>)_ of the regiment's approaching removal was indeed beyond
expression. In a fortnight they were to go--and once gone, she (<font color='blue'><b>Bennets</b></font>) hoped
there could be nothing more to plague her (<font color='blue'><b>Bennets</b></font>) on his (<font color='blue'><b>Wickham</b></font>) account.

<p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>Bennets</b></font>) had not been many hours at home before she (<font color='blue'><b>Bennets</b></font>) found that the Brighton
scheme, of which Lydia had given them a hint at the inn, was under
frequent discussion between her (<font color='blue'><b>Lydia</b></font>) parents. Elizabeth saw directly that her (<font color='blue'><b>Elizabeth</b></font>)
father had not the smallest intention of yielding; but his (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) answers were
at the same time so vague and equivocal, that her (<font color='blue'><b>Elizabeth</b></font>) mother, though often
disheartened, had never yet despaired of succeeding at last.



<p/>Chapter 40


<p/>Elizabeth's impatience to acquaint Jane with what had happened could
no longer be overcome; and at length, resolving to suppress every
particular in which her (<font color='blue'><b>Jane</b></font>) sister was concerned, and preparing her (<font color='blue'><b>Jane</b></font>) to be
surprised, she (<font color='blue'><b>Jane</b></font>) related to her (<font color='blue'><b>Jane</b></font>) the next morning the chief of the scene
between Mr. Darcy and herself.

<p/>Miss Bennet's astonishment was soon lessened by the strong sisterly
partiality which made any admiration of Elizabeth appear perfectly
natural; and all surprise was shortly lost in other feelings. She (<font color='blue'><b>Elizabeth</b></font>) was
sorry that Mr. Darcy should have delivered his (<font color='blue'><b>Darcy</b></font>) sentiments in a manner so
little suited to recommend them; but still more was she (<font color='blue'><b>Elizabeth</b></font>) grieved for the
unhappiness which her (<font color='blue'><b>Elizabeth</b></font>) sister's refusal must have given him (<font color='blue'><b>Darcy</b></font>).

<p/><div class="bookquote">``His (<font color='blue'><b>coach</b></font>) being so sure of succeeding was wrong,''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>said she (<font color='blue'><b>Elizabeth</b></font>), <div class="bookquote">``and certainly
ought not to have appeared; but consider how much it must increase his (<font color='blue'><b>coach</b></font>)
disappointment!''

 (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Indeed,''  (<font color='red'><b>Elizabeth/Miss Bennet/Miss Elizabeth</b></font>)</div>replied Elizabeth, <div class="bookquote">``I am heartily sorry for him (<font color='blue'><b>coach</b></font>); but he (<font color='blue'><b>coach</b></font>) has
other feelings, which will probably soon drive away his (<font color='blue'><b>coach</b></font>) regard for me.
You do not blame me, however, for refusing him (<font color='blue'><b>coach</b></font>)?''

 (<font color='red'><b>Elizabeth/Miss Bennet/Miss Elizabeth</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Blame you! Oh, no.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``But you blame me for having spoken so warmly of Wickham?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``No--I do not know that you were wrong in saying what you did.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``But you _will_ know it, when I tell you what happened the very next
day.''

 (<font color='red'><b>She</b></font>)</div><p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>Elizabeth</b></font>) then spoke of the letter, repeating the whole of its contents as far
as they concerned George Wickham. What a stroke was this for poor Jane!
who would willingly have gone through the world without believing that
so much wickedness existed in the whole race of mankind, as was here
collected in one individual. Nor was Darcy's vindication, though
grateful to her (<font color='blue'><b>Jane</b></font>) feelings, capable of consoling her (<font color='blue'><b>Jane</b></font>) for such discovery.
Most earnestly did she (<font color='blue'><b>Jane</b></font>) labour to prove the probability of error, and
seek to clear the one without involving the other.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``This will not do,''  (<font color='red'><b>Elizabeth/Miss Bennet/Miss Elizabeth</b></font>)</div>said Elizabeth; <div class="bookquote">``you never will be able to make both
of them good for anything. Take your choice, but you must be satisfied
with only one. There is but such a quantity of merit between them; just
enough to make one good sort of man; and of late it has been shifting
about pretty much. For my part, I am inclined to believe it all Darcy's;
but you shall do as you choose.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Elizabeth/Miss Bennet/Miss Elizabeth</b></font>)</div><p/>It was some time, however, before a smile could be extorted from Jane.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``I do not know when I have been more shocked,''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>said she (<font color='blue'><b>Jane</b></font>). <div class="bookquote">``Wickham so
very bad! It is almost past belief. And poor Mr. Darcy! Dear Lizzy, only
consider what he (<font color='blue'><b>Darcy</b></font>) must have suffered. Such a disappointment! and with the
knowledge of your ill opinion, too! and having to relate such a thing
of his (<font color='blue'><b>Darcy</b></font>) sister! It is really too distressing. I am sure you must feel it
so.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Oh! no, my regret and compassion are all done away by seeing you so
full of both. I know you will do him (<font color='blue'><b>Darcy</b></font>) such ample justice, that I am
growing every moment more unconcerned and indifferent. Your profusion
makes me saving; and if you lament over him (<font color='blue'><b>Darcy</b></font>) much longer, my heart will
be as light as a feather.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Poor Wickham! there is such an expression of goodness in his (<font color='blue'><b>Wickham</b></font>)
countenance! such an openness and gentleness in his (<font color='blue'><b>Wickham</b></font>) manner!''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``There certainly was some great mismanagement in the education of those
two young men. One has got all the goodness, and the other all the
appearance of it.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I never thought Mr. Darcy so deficient in the _appearance_ of it as you
used to do.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``And yet I meant to be uncommonly clever in taking so decided a dislike
to him (<font color='blue'><b>Darcy</b></font>), without any reason. It is such a spur to one's genius, such an
opening for wit, to have a dislike of that kind. One may be continually
abusive without saying anything just; but one cannot always be laughing
at a man without now and then stumbling on something witty.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Lizzy, when you first read that letter, I am sure you could not treat
the matter as you do now.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Indeed, I could not. I was uncomfortable enough, I may say unhappy. And
with no one to speak to about what I felt, no Jane to comfort me and say
that I had not been so very weak and vain and nonsensical as I knew I
had! Oh! how I wanted you!''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``How unfortunate that you should have used such very strong expressions
in speaking of Wickham to Mr. Darcy, for now they _do_ appear wholly
undeserved.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Certainly. But the misfortune of speaking with bitterness is a most
natural consequence of the prejudices I had been encouraging. There
is one point on which I want your advice. I want to be told whether I
ought, or ought not, to make our acquaintances in general understand
Wickham's character.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Elizabeth/Miss Bennet/Miss Elizabeth</b></font>)</div><p/>Miss Bennet paused a little, and then replied, <div class="bookquote">``Surely there can be no
occasion for exposing him (<font color='blue'><b>Wickham</b></font>) so dreadfully. What is your opinion?''

 (<font color='red'><b>Elizabeth/Miss Bennet/Miss Elizabeth</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``That it ought not to be attempted. Mr. Darcy has not authorised me
to make his (<font color='blue'><b>Darcy</b></font>) communication public. On the contrary, every particular
relative to his (<font color='blue'><b>Darcy</b></font>) sister was meant to be kept as much as possible to
myself; and if I endeavour to undeceive people as to the rest of his (<font color='blue'><b>Darcy</b></font>)
conduct, who will believe me? The general prejudice against Mr. Darcy
is so violent, that it would be the death of half the good people in
Meryton to attempt to place him (<font color='blue'><b>Darcy</b></font>) in an amiable light. I am not equal
to it. Wickham will soon be gone; and therefore it will not signify to
anyone here what he (<font color='blue'><b>Wickham</b></font>) really is. Some time hence it will be all found out,
and then we may laugh at their stupidity in not knowing it before. At
present I will say nothing about it.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``You are quite right. To have his (<font color='blue'><b>Wickham</b></font>) errors made public might ruin him (<font color='blue'><b>Wickham</b></font>) for
ever. He (<font color='blue'><b>Wickham</b></font>) is now, perhaps, sorry for what he (<font color='blue'><b>Wickham</b></font>) has done, and anxious to
re-establish a character. We must not make him (<font color='blue'><b>Wickham</b></font>) desperate.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Elizabeth/Miss Bennet/Miss Elizabeth</b></font>)</div><p/>The tumult of Elizabeth's mind was allayed by this conversation. She (<font color='blue'><b>Elizabeth</b></font>) had
got rid of two of the secrets which had weighed on her (<font color='blue'><b>Elizabeth</b></font>) for a fortnight,
and was certain of a willing listener in Jane, whenever she (<font color='blue'><b>Jane</b></font>) might wish
to talk again of either. But there was still something lurking behind,
of which prudence forbade the disclosure. She (<font color='blue'><b>Jane</b></font>) dared not relate the other
half of Mr. Darcy's letter, nor explain to her (<font color='blue'><b>Jane</b></font>) sister how sincerely she (<font color='blue'><b>Jane</b></font>)
had been valued by her (<font color='blue'><b>Jane</b></font>) friend. Here was knowledge in which no one
could partake; and she (<font color='blue'><b>Jane</b></font>) was sensible that nothing less than a perfect
understanding between the parties could justify her (<font color='blue'><b>Jane</b></font>) in throwing off
this last encumbrance of mystery. <div class="bookquote">``And then,''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>said she (<font color='blue'><b>Jane</b></font>), <div class="bookquote">``if that very
improbable event should ever take place, I shall merely be able to
tell what Bingley may tell in a much more agreeable manner himself. The
liberty of communication cannot be mine till it has lost all its value!''

 (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div><p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>Jane</b></font>) was now, on being settled at home, at leisure to observe the real
state of her (<font color='blue'><b>Jane</b></font>) sister's spirits. Jane was not happy. She (<font color='blue'><b>Jane</b></font>) still cherished a
very tender affection for Bingley. Having never even fancied herself
in love before, her (<font color='blue'><b>Jane</b></font>) regard had all the warmth of first attachment,
and, from her (<font color='blue'><b>Jane</b></font>) age and disposition, greater steadiness than most first
attachments often boast; and so fervently did she (<font color='blue'><b>Jane</b></font>) value his (<font color='blue'><b>Bingley</b></font>) remembrance,
and prefer him (<font color='blue'><b>Bingley</b></font>) to every other man, that all her (<font color='blue'><b>Jane</b></font>) good sense, and all her (<font color='blue'><b>Jane</b></font>)
attention to the feelings of her (<font color='blue'><b>Jane</b></font>) friends, were requisite to check the
indulgence of those regrets which must have been injurious to her (<font color='blue'><b>Jane</b></font>) own
health and their tranquillity.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Well, Lizzy,''  (<font color='red'><b>Mrs. Bennet</b></font>)</div>said Mrs. Bennet one day, <div class="bookquote">``what is your opinion _now_ of
this sad business of Jane's? For my part, I am determined never to speak
of it again to anybody. I told my sister Phillips so the other day. But
I cannot find out that Jane saw anything of him (<font color='blue'><b>Bingley</b></font>) in London. Well, he (<font color='blue'><b>Bingley</b></font>) is
a very undeserving young man--and I do not suppose there's the least
chance in the world of her (<font color='blue'><b>Jane</b></font>) ever getting him (<font color='blue'><b>Bingley</b></font>) now. There is no talk of
his (<font color='blue'><b>Bingley</b></font>) coming to Netherfield again in the summer; and I have inquired of
everybody, too, who is likely to know.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Mrs. Bennet</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I do not believe he (<font color='blue'><b>Bingley</b></font>) will ever live at Netherfield any more.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Oh well! it is just as he (<font color='blue'><b>Bingley</b></font>) chooses. Nobody wants him (<font color='blue'><b>Bingley</b></font>) to come. Though I
shall always say he (<font color='blue'><b>Bingley</b></font>) used my daughter extremely ill; and if I was her (<font color='blue'><b>daughter</b></font>), I
would not have put up with it. Well, my comfort is, I am sure Jane will
die of a broken heart; and then he (<font color='blue'><b>Bingley</b></font>) will be sorry for what he (<font color='blue'><b>Bingley</b></font>) has done.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Elizabeth/Miss Bennet/Miss Elizabeth</b></font>)</div><p/>But as Elizabeth could not receive comfort from any such expectation,
she (<font color='blue'><b>Elizabeth</b></font>) made no answer.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Well, Lizzy,''  (<font color='red'><b>mother</b></font>)</div>continued her (<font color='blue'><b>Elizabeth</b></font>) mother, soon afterwards, <div class="bookquote">``and so the
Collinses live very comfortable, do they? Well, well, I only hope
it will last. And what sort of table do they keep? Charlotte is an
excellent manager, I dare say. If she (<font color='blue'><b>Charlotte</b></font>) is half as sharp as her (<font color='blue'><b>Charlotte</b></font>)
mother, she (<font color='blue'><b>Charlotte</b></font>) is saving enough. There is nothing extravagant in _their_
housekeeping, I dare say.''

 (<font color='red'><b>mother</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``No, nothing at all.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``A great deal of good management, depend upon it. Yes, yes, _they_ will
take care not to outrun their income. _They_ will never be distressed
for money. Well, much good may it do them! And so, I suppose, they often
talk of having Longbourn when your father is dead. They look upon it as
quite their own, I dare say, whenever that happens.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``It was a subject which they could not mention before me.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``No; it would have been strange if they had; but I make no doubt they
often talk of it between themselves. Well, if they can be easy with an
estate that is not lawfully their own, so much the better. I should be
ashamed of having one that was only entailed on me.''



 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/>Chapter 41


<p/>The first week of their return was soon gone. The second began. It was
the last of the regiment's stay in Meryton, and all the young ladies
in the neighbourhood were drooping apace. The dejection was almost
universal. The elder Miss Bennets alone were still able to eat, drink,
and sleep, and pursue the usual course of their employments. Very
frequently were they reproached for this insensibility by Kitty and
Lydia, whose own misery was extreme, and who could not comprehend such
hard-heartedness in any of the family.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Good Heaven! what is to become of us? What are we to do?''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>would they
often exclaim in the bitterness of woe. <div class="bookquote">``How can you be smiling so,
Lizzy?''

 (<font color='red'><b>mother</b></font>)</div><p/>Their affectionate mother shared all their grief; she (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) remembered what
she (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) had herself endured on a similar occasion, five-and-twenty years
ago.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``I am sure,''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>said she (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>), <div class="bookquote">``I cried for two days together when Colonel
Miller's regiment went away. I thought I should have broken my heart.''

 (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I am sure I shall break _mine_,''  (<font color='red'><b>Lydia/Miss Lydia/Miss Lydia Bennet</b></font>)</div>said Lydia.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``If one could but go to Brighton!''  (<font color='red'><b>Mrs. Bennet</b></font>)</div>observed Mrs. Bennet.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Oh, yes!--if one could but go to Brighton! But papa is so
disagreeable.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``A little sea-bathing would set me up forever.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``And my aunt Phillips is sure it would do _me_ a great deal of good,''
 (<font color='red'><b>Kitty</b></font>)</div>added Kitty.

<p/>Such were the kind of lamentations resounding perpetually through
Longbourn House. Elizabeth tried to be diverted by them; but all sense
of pleasure was lost in shame. She (<font color='blue'><b>Elizabeth</b></font>) felt anew the justice of Mr. Darcy's
objections; and never had she (<font color='blue'><b>Elizabeth</b></font>) been so much disposed to pardon his (<font color='blue'><b>Darcy</b></font>)
interference in the views of his (<font color='blue'><b>Darcy</b></font>) friend.

<p/>But the gloom of Lydia's prospect was shortly cleared away; for she (<font color='blue'><b>Lydia</b></font>)
received an invitation from Mrs. Forster, the wife of the colonel of
the regiment, to accompany her (<font color='blue'><b>Forster</b></font>) to Brighton. This invaluable friend was a
very young woman, and very lately married. A resemblance in good humour
and good spirits had recommended her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) and Lydia to each other, and out of
their _three_ months' acquaintance they had been intimate _two_.

<p/>The rapture of Lydia on this occasion, her (<font color='blue'><b>Lydia</b></font>) adoration of Mrs. Forster,
the delight of Mrs. Bennet, and the mortification of Kitty, are scarcely
to be described. Wholly inattentive to her (<font color='blue'><b>Kitty</b></font>) sister's feelings, Lydia
flew about the house in restless ecstasy, calling for everyone's
congratulations, and laughing and talking with more violence than ever;
whilst the luckless Kitty continued in the parlour repined at her (<font color='blue'><b>Kitty</b></font>) fate
in terms as unreasonable as her (<font color='blue'><b>Kitty</b></font>) accent was peevish.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``I cannot see why Mrs. Forster should not ask _me_ as well as Lydia,''
 (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>said she (<font color='blue'><b>Kitty</b></font>), <div class="bookquote">``Though I am _not_ her (<font color='blue'><b>Lydia</b></font>) particular friend. I have just as much
right to be asked as she (<font color='blue'><b>Lydia</b></font>) has, and more too, for I am two years older.''

 (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div><p/>In vain did Elizabeth attempt to make her (<font color='blue'><b>Elizabeth</b></font>) reasonable, and Jane to make
her (<font color='blue'><b>Elizabeth</b></font>) resigned. As for Elizabeth herself, this invitation was so far from
exciting in her (<font color='blue'><b>Elizabeth</b></font>) the same feelings as in her (<font color='blue'><b>Elizabeth</b></font>) mother and Lydia, that she (<font color='blue'><b>Lydia</b></font>)
considered it as the death warrant of all possibility of common sense
for the latter; and detestable as such a step must make her (<font color='blue'><b>Lydia</b></font>) were it
known, she (<font color='blue'><b>Lydia</b></font>) could not help secretly advising her (<font color='blue'><b>Lydia</b></font>) father not to let her (<font color='blue'><b>Lydia</b></font>)
go. She (<font color='blue'><b>Lydia</b></font>) represented to him (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) all the improprieties of Lydia's general
behaviour, the little advantage she (<font color='blue'><b>Lydia</b></font>) could derive from the friendship of
such a woman as Mrs. Forster, and the probability of her (<font color='blue'><b>Forster</b></font>) being yet more
imprudent with such a companion at Brighton, where the temptations must
be greater than at home. He (<font color='blue'><b>companion</b></font>) heard her (<font color='blue'><b>Forster</b></font>) attentively, and then said:

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Lydia will never be easy until she (<font color='blue'><b>Lydia</b></font>) has exposed herself in some public
place or other, and we can never expect her (<font color='blue'><b>Lydia</b></font>) to do it with so
little expense or inconvenience to her (<font color='blue'><b>Lydia</b></font>) family as under the present
circumstances.''

 (<font color='red'><b>He</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``If you were aware,''  (<font color='red'><b>Elizabeth/Miss Bennet/Miss Elizabeth</b></font>)</div>said Elizabeth, <div class="bookquote">``of the very great disadvantage to
us all which must arise from the public notice of Lydia's unguarded and
imprudent manner--nay, which has already arisen from it, I am sure you
would judge differently in the affair.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Elizabeth/Miss Bennet/Miss Elizabeth</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Already arisen?''  (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Bennet</b></font>)</div>repeated Mr. Bennet. <div class="bookquote">``What, has she (<font color='blue'><b>Lydia</b></font>) frightened away
some of your lovers? Poor little Lizzy! But do not be cast down. Such
squeamish youths as cannot bear to be connected with a little absurdity
are not worth a regret. Come, let me see the list of pitiful fellows who
have been kept aloof by Lydia's folly.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Indeed you are mistaken. I have no such injuries to resent. It is not
of particular, but of general evils, which I am now complaining. Our
importance, our respectability in the world must be affected by the
wild volatility, the assurance and disdain of all restraint which mark
Lydia's character. Excuse me, for I must speak plainly. If you, my dear
father, will not take the trouble of checking her (<font color='blue'><b>Lydia</b></font>) exuberant spirits, and
of teaching her (<font color='blue'><b>Lydia</b></font>) that her (<font color='blue'><b>Lydia</b></font>) present pursuits are not to be the business of
her (<font color='blue'><b>Lydia</b></font>) life, she (<font color='blue'><b>Lydia</b></font>) will soon be beyond the reach of amendment. Her (<font color='blue'><b>Lydia</b></font>) character
will be fixed, and she (<font color='blue'><b>Lydia</b></font>) will, at sixteen, be the most determined flirt
that ever made herself or her (<font color='blue'><b>Lydia</b></font>) family ridiculous; a flirt, too, in the
worst and meanest degree of flirtation; without any attraction beyond
youth and a tolerable person; and, from the ignorance and emptiness
of her (<font color='blue'><b>Lydia</b></font>) mind, wholly unable to ward off any portion of that universal
contempt which her (<font color='blue'><b>Lydia</b></font>) rage for admiration will excite. In this danger
Kitty also is comprehended. She (<font color='blue'><b>Kitty</b></font>) will follow wherever Lydia leads. Vain,
ignorant, idle, and absolutely uncontrolled! Oh! my dear father, can you
suppose it possible that they will not be censured and despised wherever
they are known, and that their sisters will not be often involved in the
disgrace?''

 (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Bennet</b></font>)</div><p/>Mr. Bennet saw that her (<font color='blue'><b>Elizabeth</b></font>) whole heart was in the subject, and
affectionately taking her (<font color='blue'><b>Elizabeth</b></font>) hand said in reply:

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Do not make yourself uneasy, my love. Wherever you and Jane are known
you must be respected and valued; and you will not appear to less
advantage for having a couple of--or I may say, three--very silly
sisters. We shall have no peace at Longbourn if Lydia does not go to
Brighton. Let her (<font color='blue'><b>Lydia</b></font>) go, then. Colonel Forster is a sensible man, and will
keep her (<font color='blue'><b>Forster</b></font>) out of any real mischief; and she (<font color='blue'><b>Forster</b></font>) is luckily too poor to be an
object of prey to anybody. At Brighton she (<font color='blue'><b>Forster</b></font>) will be of less importance
even as a common flirt than she (<font color='blue'><b>flirt</b></font>) has been here. The officers will find
women better worth their notice. Let us hope, therefore, that her (<font color='blue'><b>flirt</b></font>) being
there may teach her (<font color='blue'><b>flirt</b></font>) her (<font color='blue'><b>flirt</b></font>) own insignificance. At any rate, she (<font color='blue'><b>flirt</b></font>) cannot grow
many degrees worse, without authorising us to lock her (<font color='blue'><b>flirt</b></font>) up for the rest
of her (<font color='blue'><b>flirt</b></font>) life.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Bennet</b></font>)</div><p/>With this answer Elizabeth was forced to be content; but her (<font color='blue'><b>Elizabeth</b></font>) own opinion
continued the same, and she (<font color='blue'><b>Elizabeth</b></font>) left him (<font color='blue'><b>Bennet</b></font>) disappointed and sorry. It was not
in her (<font color='blue'><b>Elizabeth</b></font>) nature, however, to increase her (<font color='blue'><b>Elizabeth</b></font>) vexations by dwelling on
them. She (<font color='blue'><b>Elizabeth</b></font>) was confident of having performed her (<font color='blue'><b>Elizabeth</b></font>) duty, and to fret
over unavoidable evils, or augment them by anxiety, was no part of her (<font color='blue'><b>Elizabeth</b></font>)
disposition.

<p/>Had Lydia and her (<font color='blue'><b>Lydia</b></font>) mother known the substance of her (<font color='blue'><b>Lydia</b></font>) conference with her (<font color='blue'><b>Lydia</b></font>)
father, their indignation would hardly have found expression in their
united volubility. In Lydia's imagination, a visit to Brighton comprised
every possibility of earthly happiness. She (<font color='blue'><b>Lydia</b></font>) saw, with the creative eye
of fancy, the streets of that gay bathing-place covered with officers.
She (<font color='blue'><b>Lydia</b></font>) saw herself the object of attention, to tens and to scores of them
at present unknown. She (<font color='blue'><b>Lydia</b></font>) saw all the glories of the camp--its tents
stretched forth in beauteous uniformity of lines, crowded with the young
and the gay, and dazzling with scarlet; and, to complete the view, she (<font color='blue'><b>Lydia</b></font>)
saw herself seated beneath a tent, tenderly flirting with at least six
officers at once.

<p/>Had she (<font color='blue'><b>Lydia</b></font>) known her (<font color='blue'><b>Lydia</b></font>) sister sought to tear her (<font color='blue'><b>Lydia</b></font>) from such prospects and such
realities as these, what would have been her (<font color='blue'><b>Lydia</b></font>) sensations? They could have
been understood only by her (<font color='blue'><b>Lydia</b></font>) mother, who might have felt nearly the same.
Lydia's going to Brighton was all that consoled her (<font color='blue'><b>Lydia</b></font>) for her (<font color='blue'><b>Lydia</b></font>) melancholy
conviction of her (<font color='blue'><b>Lydia</b></font>) husband's never intending to go there himself.

<p/>But they were entirely ignorant of what had passed; and their raptures
continued, with little intermission, to the very day of Lydia's leaving
home.

<p/>Elizabeth was now to see Mr. Wickham for the last time. Having been
frequently in company with him (<font color='blue'><b>Wickham</b></font>) since her (<font color='blue'><b>Elizabeth</b></font>) return, agitation was pretty
well over; the agitations of former partiality entirely so. She (<font color='blue'><b>Elizabeth</b></font>) had even
learnt to detect, in the very gentleness which had first delighted
her (<font color='blue'><b>Elizabeth</b></font>), an affectation and a sameness to disgust and weary. In his (<font color='blue'><b>Wickham</b></font>) present
behaviour to herself, moreover, she (<font color='blue'><b>Elizabeth</b></font>) had a fresh source of displeasure,
for the inclination he (<font color='blue'><b>Wickham</b></font>) soon testified of renewing those intentions which
had marked the early part of their acquaintance could only serve, after
what had since passed, to provoke her (<font color='blue'><b>Elizabeth</b></font>). She (<font color='blue'><b>Elizabeth</b></font>) lost all concern for him (<font color='blue'><b>acquaintance</b></font>) in
finding herself thus selected as the object of such idle and frivolous
gallantry; and while she (<font color='blue'><b>Elizabeth</b></font>) steadily repressed it, could not but feel the
reproof contained in his (<font color='blue'><b>acquaintance</b></font>) believing, that however long, and for whatever
cause, his (<font color='blue'><b>acquaintance</b></font>) attentions had been withdrawn, her (<font color='blue'><b>Elizabeth</b></font>) vanity would be gratified,
and her (<font color='blue'><b>Elizabeth</b></font>) preference secured at any time by their renewal.

<p/>On the very last day of the regiment's remaining at Meryton, he (<font color='blue'><b>acquaintance</b></font>) dined,
with other of the officers, at Longbourn; and so little was Elizabeth
disposed to part from him (<font color='blue'><b>acquaintance</b></font>) in good humour, that on his (<font color='blue'><b>acquaintance</b></font>) making some
inquiry as to the manner in which her (<font color='blue'><b>Elizabeth</b></font>) time had passed at Hunsford, she (<font color='blue'><b>Elizabeth</b></font>)
mentioned Colonel Fitzwilliam's and Mr. Darcy's having both spent three
weeks at Rosings, and asked him (<font color='blue'><b>Darcy</b></font>), if he (<font color='blue'><b>Darcy</b></font>) was acquainted with the former.

<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Darcy</b></font>) looked surprised, displeased, alarmed; but with a moment's
recollection and a returning smile, replied, that he (<font color='blue'><b>Darcy</b></font>) had formerly seen
him (<font color='blue'><b>Darcy</b></font>) often; and, after observing that he (<font color='blue'><b>Darcy</b></font>) was a very gentlemanlike man,
asked her (<font color='blue'><b>Elizabeth</b></font>) how she (<font color='blue'><b>Elizabeth</b></font>) had liked him (<font color='blue'><b>Darcy</b></font>). Her (<font color='blue'><b>Elizabeth</b></font>) answer was warmly in his (<font color='blue'><b>Darcy</b></font>) favour.
With an air of indifference he (<font color='blue'><b>Darcy</b></font>) soon afterwards added:

<p/><div class="bookquote">``How long did you say he (<font color='blue'><b>Forster</b></font>) was at Rosings?''

 (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Nearly three weeks.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``And you saw him (<font color='blue'><b>Forster</b></font>) frequently?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Yes, almost every day.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``His (<font color='blue'><b>Forster</b></font>) manners are very different from his (<font color='blue'><b>Forster</b></font>) cousin's.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Yes, very different. But I think Mr. Darcy improves upon acquaintance.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Indeed!''  (<font color='red'><b>Wickham/Mr. Wickham</b></font>)</div>cried Mr. Wickham with a look which did not escape her (<font color='blue'><b>Elizabeth</b></font>). <div class="bookquote">``And
pray, may I ask?--''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>But checking himself, he (<font color='blue'><b>Wickham</b></font>) added, in a gayer tone, <div class="bookquote">``Is
it in address that he (<font color='blue'><b>Darcy</b></font>) improves? Has he (<font color='blue'><b>Darcy</b></font>) deigned to add aught of civility
to his (<font color='blue'><b>Darcy</b></font>) ordinary style?--for I dare not hope,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Wickham</b></font>) continued in a lower
and more serious tone, <div class="bookquote">``that he (<font color='blue'><b>Darcy</b></font>) is improved in essentials.''

 (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Oh, no!''  (<font color='red'><b>Elizabeth/Miss Bennet/Miss Elizabeth</b></font>)</div>said Elizabeth. <div class="bookquote">``In essentials, I believe, he (<font color='blue'><b>Darcy</b></font>) is very much
what he (<font color='blue'><b>Darcy</b></font>) ever was.''

 (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div><p/>While she (<font color='blue'><b>Elizabeth</b></font>) spoke, Wickham looked as if scarcely knowing whether to
rejoice over her (<font color='blue'><b>Elizabeth</b></font>) words, or to distrust their meaning. There was a
something in her (<font color='blue'><b>Elizabeth</b></font>) countenance which made him (<font color='blue'><b>Wickham</b></font>) listen with an apprehensive
and anxious attention, while she (<font color='blue'><b>Elizabeth</b></font>) added:

<p/><div class="bookquote">``When I said that he (<font color='blue'><b>Darcy</b></font>) improved on acquaintance, I did not mean that
his (<font color='blue'><b>Darcy</b></font>) mind or his (<font color='blue'><b>Darcy</b></font>) manners were in a state of improvement, but that, from
knowing him (<font color='blue'><b>Darcy</b></font>) better, his (<font color='blue'><b>Darcy</b></font>) disposition was better understood.''

 (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div><p/>Wickham's alarm now appeared in a heightened complexion and agitated
look; for a few minutes he (<font color='blue'><b>Wickham</b></font>) was silent, till, shaking off his (<font color='blue'><b>Wickham</b></font>)
embarrassment, he (<font color='blue'><b>Wickham</b></font>) turned to her (<font color='blue'><b>Elizabeth</b></font>) again, and said in the gentlest of
accents:

<p/><div class="bookquote">``You, who so well know my feeling towards Mr. Darcy, will readily
comprehend how sincerely I must rejoice that he (<font color='blue'><b>Darcy</b></font>) is wise enough to assume
even the _appearance_ of what is right. His (<font color='blue'><b>Darcy</b></font>) pride, in that direction,
may be of service, if not to himself, to many others, for it must only
deter him (<font color='blue'><b>Darcy</b></font>) from such foul misconduct as I have suffered by. I only
fear that the sort of cautiousness to which you, I imagine, have been
alluding, is merely adopted on his (<font color='blue'><b>Darcy</b></font>) visits to his (<font color='blue'><b>Darcy</b></font>) aunt, of whose good
opinion and judgement he (<font color='blue'><b>Darcy</b></font>) stands much in awe. His (<font color='blue'><b>Darcy</b></font>) fear of her (<font color='blue'><b>aunt</b></font>) has always
operated, I know, when they were together; and a good deal is to be
imputed to his (<font color='blue'><b>Darcy</b></font>) wish of forwarding the match with Miss de Bourgh, which I
am certain he (<font color='blue'><b>Darcy</b></font>) has very much at heart.''

 (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div><p/>Elizabeth could not repress a smile at this, but she (<font color='blue'><b>Elizabeth</b></font>) answered only by a
slight inclination of the head. She (<font color='blue'><b>Elizabeth</b></font>) saw that he (<font color='blue'><b>Wickham</b></font>) wanted to engage her (<font color='blue'><b>Elizabeth</b></font>) on
the old subject of his (<font color='blue'><b>Wickham</b></font>) grievances, and she (<font color='blue'><b>Elizabeth</b></font>) was in no humour to indulge
him (<font color='blue'><b>Wickham</b></font>). The rest of the evening passed with the _appearance_, on his (<font color='blue'><b>Wickham</b></font>)
side, of usual cheerfulness, but with no further attempt to distinguish
Elizabeth; and they parted at last with mutual civility, and possibly a
mutual desire of never meeting again.

<p/>When the party broke up, Lydia returned with Mrs. Forster to Meryton,
from whence they were to set out early the next morning. The separation
between her (<font color='blue'><b>Lydia</b></font>) and her (<font color='blue'><b>Lydia</b></font>) family was rather noisy than pathetic. Kitty was the
only one who shed tears; but she (<font color='blue'><b>Lydia</b></font>) did weep from vexation and envy. Mrs.
Bennet was diffuse in her (<font color='blue'><b>Bennet</b></font>) good wishes for the felicity of her (<font color='blue'><b>Bennet</b></font>) daughter,
and impressive in her (<font color='blue'><b>Bennet</b></font>) injunctions that she (<font color='blue'><b>Bennet</b></font>) should not miss the
opportunity of enjoying herself as much as possible--advice which
there was every reason to believe would be well attended to; and in
the clamorous happiness of Lydia herself in bidding farewell, the more
gentle adieus of her (<font color='blue'><b>Lydia</b></font>) sisters were uttered without being heard.



<p/>Chapter 42


<p/>Had Elizabeth's opinion been all drawn from her (<font color='blue'><b>Elizabeth</b></font>) own family, she (<font color='blue'><b>Elizabeth</b></font>) could
not have formed a very pleasing opinion of conjugal felicity or domestic
comfort. Her (<font color='blue'><b>Elizabeth</b></font>) father, captivated by youth and beauty, and that appearance
of good humour which youth and beauty generally give, had married a
woman whose weak understanding and illiberal mind had very early in
their marriage put an end to all real affection for her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>). Respect,
esteem, and confidence had vanished for ever; and all his (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) views
of domestic happiness were overthrown. But Mr. Bennet was not of
a disposition to seek comfort for the disappointment which his (<font color='blue'><b>Bennet</b></font>) own
imprudence had brought on, in any of those pleasures which too often
console the unfortunate for their folly or their vice. He (<font color='blue'><b>Bennet</b></font>) was fond of
the country and of books; and from these tastes had arisen his (<font color='blue'><b>Bennet</b></font>) principal
enjoyments. To his (<font color='blue'><b>Bennet</b></font>) wife he (<font color='blue'><b>Bennet</b></font>) was very little otherwise indebted, than as
her (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>) ignorance and folly had contributed to his (<font color='blue'><b>Bennet</b></font>) amusement. This is not
the sort of happiness which a man would in general wish to owe to his (<font color='blue'><b>Bennet</b></font>)
wife; but where other powers of entertainment are wanting, the true
philosopher will derive benefit from such as are given.

<p/>Elizabeth, however, had never been blind to the impropriety of her (<font color='blue'><b>Elizabeth</b></font>)
father's behaviour as a husband. She (<font color='blue'><b>Elizabeth</b></font>) had always seen it with pain; but
respecting his (<font color='blue'><b>husband</b></font>) abilities, and grateful for his (<font color='blue'><b>husband</b></font>) affectionate treatment of
herself, she (<font color='blue'><b>Elizabeth</b></font>) endeavoured to forget what she (<font color='blue'><b>Elizabeth</b></font>) could not overlook, and to
banish from her (<font color='blue'><b>Elizabeth</b></font>) thoughts that continual breach of conjugal obligation
and decorum which, in exposing his (<font color='blue'><b>husband</b></font>) wife to the contempt of her (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>) own
children, was so highly reprehensible. But she (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>) had never felt so
strongly as now the disadvantages which must attend the children of so
unsuitable a marriage, nor ever been so fully aware of the evils arising
from so ill-judged a direction of talents; talents, which, rightly used,
might at least have preserved the respectability of his (<font color='blue'><b>husband</b></font>) daughters, even
if incapable of enlarging the mind of his (<font color='blue'><b>husband</b></font>) wife.

<p/>When Elizabeth had rejoiced over Wickham's departure she (<font color='blue'><b>Elizabeth</b></font>) found little
other cause for satisfaction in the loss of the regiment. Their parties
abroad were less varied than before, and at home she (<font color='blue'><b>Elizabeth</b></font>) had a mother and
sister whose constant repinings at the dullness of everything around
them threw a real gloom over their domestic circle; and, though Kitty
might in time regain her (<font color='blue'><b>Kitty</b></font>) natural degree of sense, since the disturbers
of her (<font color='blue'><b>Kitty</b></font>) brain were removed, her (<font color='blue'><b>Kitty</b></font>) other sister, from whose disposition
greater evil might be apprehended, was likely to be hardened in all
her (<font color='blue'><b>Kitty</b></font>) folly and assurance by a situation of such double danger as a
watering-place and a camp. Upon the whole, therefore, she (<font color='blue'><b>Kitty</b></font>) found, what
has been sometimes found before, that an event to which she (<font color='blue'><b>Kitty</b></font>) had been
looking with impatient desire did not, in taking place, bring all the
satisfaction she (<font color='blue'><b>Kitty</b></font>) had promised herself. It was consequently necessary to
name some other period for the commencement of actual felicity--to have
some other point on which her (<font color='blue'><b>Kitty</b></font>) wishes and hopes might be fixed, and by
again enjoying the pleasure of anticipation, console herself for the
present, and prepare for another disappointment. Her (<font color='blue'><b>Kitty</b></font>) tour to the Lakes
was now the object of her (<font color='blue'><b>Kitty</b></font>) happiest thoughts; it was her (<font color='blue'><b>Kitty</b></font>) best consolation
for all the uncomfortable hours which the discontentedness of her (<font color='blue'><b>Kitty</b></font>) mother
and Kitty made inevitable; and could she (<font color='blue'><b>Kitty</b></font>) have included Jane in the
scheme, every part of it would have been perfect.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``But it is fortunate,''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>thought she (<font color='blue'><b>Jane</b></font>), <div class="bookquote">``that I have something to wish for.
Were the whole arrangement complete, my disappointment would be certain.
But here, by carrying with me one ceaseless source of regret in my
sister's absence, I may reasonably hope to have all my expectations of
pleasure realised. A scheme of which every part promises delight can
never be successful; and general disappointment is only warded off by
the defence of some little peculiar vexation.''

 (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div><p/>When Lydia went away she (<font color='blue'><b>Lydia</b></font>) promised to write very often and very minutely
to her (<font color='blue'><b>Lydia</b></font>) mother and Kitty; but her (<font color='blue'><b>Lydia</b></font>) letters were always long expected, and
always very short. Those to her (<font color='blue'><b>Lydia</b></font>) mother contained little else than that
they were just returned from the library, where such and such officers
had attended them, and where she (<font color='blue'><b>Lydia</b></font>) had seen such beautiful ornaments as
made her (<font color='blue'><b>Lydia</b></font>) quite wild; that she (<font color='blue'><b>Lydia</b></font>) had a new gown, or a new parasol, which
she (<font color='blue'><b>Lydia</b></font>) would have described more fully, but was obliged to leave off in a
violent hurry, as Mrs. Forster called her (<font color='blue'><b>Forster</b></font>), and they were going off to
the camp; and from her (<font color='blue'><b>Forster</b></font>) correspondence with her (<font color='blue'><b>Forster</b></font>) sister, there was still
less to be learnt--for her (<font color='blue'><b>Forster</b></font>) letters to Kitty, though rather longer, were
much too full of lines under the words to be made public.

<p/>After the first fortnight or three weeks of her (<font color='blue'><b>Kitty</b></font>) absence, health, good
humour, and cheerfulness began to reappear at Longbourn. Everything wore
a happier aspect. The families who had been in town for the winter came
back again, and summer finery and summer engagements arose. Mrs. Bennet
was restored to her (<font color='blue'><b>Bennet</b></font>) usual querulous serenity; and, by the middle of
June, Kitty was so much recovered as to be able to enter Meryton without
tears; an event of such happy promise as to make Elizabeth hope that by
the following Christmas she (<font color='blue'><b>Elizabeth</b></font>) might be so tolerably reasonable as not to
mention an officer above once a day, unless, by some cruel and malicious
arrangement at the War Office, another regiment should be quartered in
Meryton.

<p/>The time fixed for the beginning of their northern tour was now fast
approaching, and a fortnight only was wanting of it, when a letter
arrived from Mrs. Gardiner, which at once delayed its commencement and
curtailed its extent. Mr. Gardiner would be prevented by business from
setting out till a fortnight later in July, and must be in London again
within a month, and as that left too short a period for them to go so
far, and see so much as they had proposed, or at least to see it with
the leisure and comfort they had built on, they were obliged to give up
the Lakes, and substitute a more contracted tour, and, according to the
present plan, were to go no farther northwards than Derbyshire. In that
county there was enough to be seen to occupy the chief of their three
weeks; and to Mrs. Gardiner it had a peculiarly strong attraction. The
town where she (<font color='blue'><b>Gardiner</b></font>) had formerly passed some years of her (<font color='blue'><b>Gardiner</b></font>) life, and where
they were now to spend a few days, was probably as great an object of
her (<font color='blue'><b>Gardiner</b></font>) curiosity as all the celebrated beauties of Matlock, Chatsworth,
Dovedale, or the Peak.

<p/>Elizabeth was excessively disappointed; she (<font color='blue'><b>Elizabeth</b></font>) had set her (<font color='blue'><b>Elizabeth</b></font>) heart on seeing
the Lakes, and still thought there might have been time enough. But it
was her (<font color='blue'><b>Elizabeth</b></font>) business to be satisfied--and certainly her (<font color='blue'><b>Elizabeth</b></font>) temper to be happy;
and all was soon right again.

<p/>With the mention of Derbyshire there were many ideas connected. It was
impossible for her (<font color='blue'><b>Elizabeth</b></font>) to see the word without thinking of Pemberley and its
owner. <div class="bookquote">``But surely,''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>said she (<font color='blue'><b>Elizabeth</b></font>), <div class="bookquote">``I may enter his (<font color='blue'><b>it</b></font>) county with impunity,
and rob it of a few petrified spars without his (<font color='blue'><b>it</b></font>) perceiving me.''

 (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div><p/>The period of expectation was now doubled. Four weeks were to pass away
before her (<font color='blue'><b>Elizabeth</b></font>) uncle and aunt's arrival. But they did pass away, and Mr.
and Mrs. Gardiner, with their four children, did at length appear at
Longbourn. The children, two girls of six and eight years old, and two
younger boys, were to be left under the particular care of their
cousin Jane, who was the general favourite, and whose steady sense and
sweetness of temper exactly adapted her (<font color='blue'><b>Jane</b></font>) for attending to them in every
way--teaching them, playing with them, and loving them.

<p/>The Gardiners stayed only one night at Longbourn, and set off the
next morning with Elizabeth in pursuit of novelty and amusement.
One enjoyment was certain--that of suitableness of companions;
a suitableness which comprehended health and temper to bear
inconveniences--cheerfulness to enhance every pleasure--and affection
and intelligence, which might supply it among themselves if there were
disappointments abroad.

<p/>It is not the object of this work to give a description of Derbyshire,
nor of any of the remarkable places through which their route thither
lay; Oxford, Blenheim, Warwick, Kenilworth, Birmingham, etc. are
sufficiently known. A small part of Derbyshire is all the present
concern. To the little town of Lambton, the scene of Mrs. Gardiner's
former residence, and where she (<font color='blue'><b>Gardiner</b></font>) had lately learned some acquaintance
still remained, they bent their steps, after having seen all the
principal wonders of the country; and within five miles of Lambton,
Elizabeth found from her (<font color='blue'><b>Elizabeth</b></font>) aunt that Pemberley was situated. It was not
in their direct road, nor more than a mile or two out of it. In
talking over their route the evening before, Mrs. Gardiner expressed
an inclination to see the place again. Mr. Gardiner declared his (<font color='blue'><b>Gardiner</b></font>)
willingness, and Elizabeth was applied to for her (<font color='blue'><b>Elizabeth</b></font>) approbation.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``My love, should not you like to see a place of which you have heard
so much?''  (<font color='red'><b>aunt place</b></font>)</div>said her (<font color='blue'><b>Elizabeth</b></font>) aunt; <div class="bookquote">``a place, too, with which so many of your
acquaintances are connected. Wickham passed all his (<font color='blue'><b>Wickham</b></font>) youth there, you
know.''

 (<font color='red'><b>aunt place</b></font>)</div><p/>Elizabeth was distressed. She (<font color='blue'><b>Elizabeth</b></font>) felt that she (<font color='blue'><b>Elizabeth</b></font>) had no business at
Pemberley, and was obliged to assume a disinclination for seeing it. She (<font color='blue'><b>Elizabeth</b></font>)
must own that she (<font color='blue'><b>Elizabeth</b></font>) was tired of seeing great houses; after going over so
many, she (<font color='blue'><b>Elizabeth</b></font>) really had no pleasure in fine carpets or satin curtains.

<p/>Mrs. Gardiner abused her (<font color='blue'><b>Gardiner</b></font>) stupidity. <div class="bookquote">``If it were merely a fine house
richly furnished,''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>said she (<font color='blue'><b>Gardiner</b></font>), <div class="bookquote">``I should not care about it myself; but
the grounds are delightful. They have some of the finest woods in the
country.''

 (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div><p/>Elizabeth said no more--but her (<font color='blue'><b>Elizabeth</b></font>) mind could not acquiesce. The
possibility of meeting Mr. Darcy, while viewing the place, instantly
occurred. It would be dreadful! She (<font color='blue'><b>Elizabeth</b></font>) blushed at the very idea, and
thought it would be better to speak openly to her (<font color='blue'><b>Elizabeth</b></font>) aunt than to run such
a risk. But against this there were objections; and she (<font color='blue'><b>Elizabeth</b></font>) finally resolved
that it could be the last resource, if her (<font color='blue'><b>Elizabeth</b></font>) private inquiries to the
absence of the family were unfavourably answered.

<p/>Accordingly, when she (<font color='blue'><b>Elizabeth</b></font>) retired at night, she (<font color='blue'><b>Elizabeth</b></font>) asked the chambermaid
whether Pemberley were not a very fine place? what was the name of its
proprietor? and, with no little alarm, whether the family were down for
the summer? A most welcome negative followed the last question--and her (<font color='blue'><b>Elizabeth</b></font>)
alarms now being removed, she (<font color='blue'><b>Elizabeth</b></font>) was at leisure to feel a great deal of
curiosity to see the house herself; and when the subject was revived the
next morning, and she (<font color='blue'><b>Elizabeth</b></font>) was again applied to, could readily answer, and
with a proper air of indifference, that she (<font color='blue'><b>Elizabeth</b></font>) had not really any dislike
to the scheme. To Pemberley, therefore, they were to go.



<p/>Chapter 43


<p/>Elizabeth, as they drove along, watched for the first appearance of
Pemberley Woods with some perturbation; and when at length they turned
in at the lodge, her (<font color='blue'><b>Elizabeth</b></font>) spirits were in a high flutter.

<p/>The park was very large, and contained great variety of ground. They
entered it in one of its lowest points, and drove for some time through
a beautiful wood stretching over a wide extent.

<p/>Elizabeth's mind was too full for conversation, but she (<font color='blue'><b>Elizabeth</b></font>) saw and admired
every remarkable spot and point of view. They gradually ascended for
half-a-mile, and then found themselves at the top of a considerable
eminence, where the wood ceased, and the eye was instantly caught by
Pemberley House, situated on the opposite side of a valley, into which
the road with some abruptness wound. It was a large, handsome stone
building, standing well on rising ground, and backed by a ridge of
high woody hills; and in front, a stream of some natural importance was
swelled into greater, but without any artificial appearance. Its banks
were neither formal nor falsely adorned. Elizabeth was delighted. She (<font color='blue'><b>Elizabeth</b></font>)
had never seen a place for which nature had done more, or where natural
beauty had been so little counteracted by an awkward taste. They were
all of them warm in their admiration; and at that moment she (<font color='blue'><b>Elizabeth</b></font>) felt that
to be mistress of Pemberley might be something!

<p/>They descended the hill, crossed the bridge, and drove to the door; and,
while examining the nearer aspect of the house, all her (<font color='blue'><b>Elizabeth</b></font>) apprehension of
meeting its owner returned. She (<font color='blue'><b>Elizabeth</b></font>) dreaded lest the chambermaid had been
mistaken. On applying to see the place, they were admitted into the
hall; and Elizabeth, as they waited for the housekeeper, had leisure to
wonder at her (<font color='blue'><b>Elizabeth</b></font>) being where she (<font color='blue'><b>Elizabeth</b></font>) was.

<p/>The housekeeper came; a respectable-looking elderly woman, much less
fine, and more civil, than she (<font color='blue'><b>Elizabeth</b></font>) had any notion of finding her (<font color='blue'><b>Elizabeth</b></font>). They
followed her (<font color='blue'><b>Elizabeth</b></font>) into the dining-parlour. It was a large, well proportioned
room, handsomely fitted up. Elizabeth, after slightly surveying it, went
to a window to enjoy its prospect. The hill, crowned with wood, which
they had descended, receiving increased abruptness from the distance,
was a beautiful object. Every disposition of the ground was good; and
she (<font color='blue'><b>Elizabeth</b></font>) looked on the whole scene, the river, the trees scattered on its
banks and the winding of the valley, as far as she (<font color='blue'><b>Elizabeth</b></font>) could trace it,
with delight. As they passed into other rooms these objects were taking
different positions; but from every window there were beauties to be
seen. The rooms were lofty and handsome, and their furniture suitable to
the fortune of its proprietor; but Elizabeth saw, with admiration of
his (<font color='blue'><b>proprietor</b></font>) taste, that it was neither gaudy nor uselessly fine; with less of
splendour, and more real elegance, than the furniture of Rosings.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``And of this place,''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>thought she (<font color='blue'><b>Elizabeth</b></font>), <div class="bookquote">``I might have been mistress! With
these rooms I might now have been familiarly acquainted! Instead of
viewing them as a stranger, I might have rejoiced in them as my own, and
welcomed to them as visitors my uncle and aunt. But no,'' (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>--recollecting
herself--<div class="bookquote">``that could never be; my uncle and aunt would have been lost to
me; I should not have been allowed to invite them.''

 (<font color='red'><b>her</b></font>)</div><p/>This was a lucky recollection--it saved her (<font color='blue'><b>Elizabeth</b></font>) from something very like
regret.

<p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>Elizabeth</b></font>) longed to inquire of the housekeeper whether her (<font color='blue'><b>Elizabeth</b></font>) master was really
absent, but had not the courage for it. At length however, the question
was asked by her (<font color='blue'><b>Elizabeth</b></font>) uncle; and she (<font color='blue'><b>Elizabeth</b></font>) turned away with alarm, while Mrs.
Reynolds replied that he (<font color='blue'><b>uncle</b></font>) was, adding, <div class="bookquote">``But we expect him (<font color='blue'><b>uncle</b></font>) to-morrow, with
a large party of friends.''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>How rejoiced was Elizabeth that their own
journey had not by any circumstance been delayed a day!

<p/>Her (<font color='blue'><b>Elizabeth</b></font>) aunt now called her (<font color='blue'><b>Elizabeth</b></font>) to look at a picture. She (<font color='blue'><b>Elizabeth</b></font>) approached and saw the
likeness of Mr. Wickham, suspended, amongst several other miniatures,
over the mantelpiece. Her (<font color='blue'><b>Elizabeth</b></font>) aunt asked her (<font color='blue'><b>Elizabeth</b></font>), smilingly, how she (<font color='blue'><b>Elizabeth</b></font>) liked it.
The housekeeper came forward, and told them it was a picture of a young
gentleman, the son of her (<font color='blue'><b>housekeeper</b></font>) late master's steward, who had been brought
up by him (<font color='blue'><b>steward</b></font>) at his (<font color='blue'><b>steward</b></font>) own expense. <div class="bookquote">``He (<font color='blue'><b>uncle</b></font>) is now gone into the army,''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>housekeeper</b></font>) added;
<div class="bookquote">``but I am afraid he (<font color='blue'><b>uncle</b></font>) has turned out very wild.''

 (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div><p/>Mrs. Gardiner looked at her (<font color='blue'><b>Gardiner</b></font>) niece with a smile, but Elizabeth could not
return it.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``And that,''  (<font color='red'><b>Mrs. Reynolds</b></font>)</div>said Mrs. Reynolds, pointing to another of the miniatures,
<div class="bookquote">``is my master--and very like him (<font color='blue'><b>master</b></font>). It was drawn at the same time as the
other--about eight years ago.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Mrs. Reynolds</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I have heard much of your master's fine person,''  (<font color='red'><b>Mrs. Gardiner/Gardiner/GARDINER</b></font>)</div>said Mrs. Gardiner,
looking at the picture; <div class="bookquote">``it is a handsome face. But, Lizzy, you can tell
us whether it is like or not.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Mrs. Gardiner/Gardiner/GARDINER</b></font>)</div><p/>Mrs. Reynolds respect for Elizabeth seemed to increase on this
intimation of her (<font color='blue'><b>Elizabeth</b></font>) knowing her (<font color='blue'><b>Elizabeth</b></font>) master.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Does that young lady know Mr. Darcy?''

 (<font color='red'><b>Elizabeth/Miss Bennet/Miss Elizabeth</b></font>)</div><p/>Elizabeth coloured, and said: <div class="bookquote">``A little.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Elizabeth/Miss Bennet/Miss Elizabeth</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``And do not you think him (<font color='blue'><b>Darcy</b></font>) a very handsome gentleman, ma'am?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Yes, very handsome.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I am sure I know none so handsome; but in the gallery up stairs you
will see a finer, larger picture of him (<font color='blue'><b>Darcy</b></font>) than this. This room was my late
master's favourite room, and these miniatures are just as they used to
be then. He (<font color='blue'><b>master</b></font>) was very fond of them.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Elizabeth/Miss Bennet/Miss Elizabeth</b></font>)</div><p/>This accounted to Elizabeth for Mr. Wickham's being among them.

<p/>Mrs. Reynolds then directed their attention to one of Miss Darcy, drawn
when she (<font color='blue'><b>Reynolds</b></font>) was only eight years old.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``And is Miss Darcy as handsome as her (<font color='blue'><b>Darcy</b></font>) brother?''  (<font color='red'><b>Mrs. Gardiner/Gardiner/GARDINER</b></font>)</div>said Mrs. Gardiner.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Oh! yes--the handsomest young lady that ever was seen; and so
accomplished!--She (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) plays and sings all day long. In the next room is
a new instrument just come down for her (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>)--a present from my master; she (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>)
comes here to-morrow with him (<font color='blue'><b>master</b></font>).''

 (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Gardiner/Gardiner</b></font>)</div><p/>Mr. Gardiner, whose manners were very easy and pleasant, encouraged her (<font color='blue'><b>Gardiner</b></font>)
communicativeness by his (<font color='blue'><b>Gardiner</b></font>) questions and remarks; Mrs. Reynolds, either
by pride or attachment, had evidently great pleasure in talking of her (<font color='blue'><b>Reynolds</b></font>)
master and his (<font color='blue'><b>master</b></font>) sister.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Is your master much at Pemberley in the course of the year?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Not so much as I could wish, sir; but I dare say he (<font color='blue'><b>master</b></font>) may spend half his (<font color='blue'><b>master</b></font>)
time here; and Miss Darcy is always down for the summer months.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Except,''  (<font color='red'><b>Elizabeth/Miss Bennet/Miss Elizabeth</b></font>)</div>thought Elizabeth, <div class="bookquote">``when she (<font color='blue'><b>Darcy</b></font>) goes to Ramsgate.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Elizabeth/Miss Bennet/Miss Elizabeth</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``If your master would marry, you might see more of him (<font color='blue'><b>master</b></font>).''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Yes, sir; but I do not know when _that_ will be. I do not know who is
good enough for him (<font color='blue'><b>master</b></font>).''

 (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Mrs.</b></font>)</div><p/>Mr. and Mrs. Gardiner smiled. Elizabeth could not help saying, <div class="bookquote">``It is
very much to his (<font color='blue'><b>master</b></font>) credit, I am sure, that you should think so.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Elizabeth/Miss Bennet/Miss Elizabeth</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I say no more than the truth, and everybody will say that knows him (<font color='blue'><b>master</b></font>),''
 (<font color='red'><b>Elizabeth/Miss Bennet/Miss Elizabeth</b></font>)</div>replied the other. Elizabeth thought this was going pretty far; and she (<font color='blue'><b>Elizabeth</b></font>)
listened with increasing astonishment as the housekeeper added, <div class="bookquote">``I have
never known a cross word from him (<font color='blue'><b>master</b></font>) in my life, and I have known him (<font color='blue'><b>master</b></font>) ever
since he (<font color='blue'><b>master</b></font>) was four years old.''

 (<font color='red'><b>the housekeeper</b></font>)</div><p/>This was praise, of all others most extraordinary, most opposite to her (<font color='blue'><b>Elizabeth</b></font>)
ideas. That he (<font color='blue'><b>master</b></font>) was not a good-tempered man had been her (<font color='blue'><b>Elizabeth</b></font>) firmest opinion.
Her (<font color='blue'><b>Elizabeth</b></font>) keenest attention was awakened; she (<font color='blue'><b>Elizabeth</b></font>) longed to hear more, and was
grateful to her (<font color='blue'><b>Elizabeth</b></font>) uncle for saying:

<p/><div class="bookquote">``There are very few people of whom so much can be said. You are lucky in
having such a master.''

 (<font color='red'><b>uncle</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Yes, sir, I know I am. If I were to go through the world, I could
not meet with a better. But I have always observed, that they who are
good-natured when children, are good-natured when they grow up; and
he (<font color='blue'><b>master</b></font>) was always the sweetest-tempered, most generous-hearted boy in the
world.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Elizabeth/Miss Bennet/Miss Elizabeth</b></font>)</div><p/>Elizabeth almost stared at her (<font color='blue'><b>Elizabeth</b></font>). <div class="bookquote">``Can this be Mr. Darcy?''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>thought she (<font color='blue'><b>Elizabeth</b></font>).

<p/><div class="bookquote">``His (<font color='blue'><b>Darcy</b></font>) father was an excellent man,''  (<font color='red'><b>Mrs. Gardiner/Gardiner/GARDINER</b></font>)</div>said Mrs. Gardiner.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Yes, ma'am, that he (<font color='blue'><b>Darcy</b></font>) was indeed; and his (<font color='blue'><b>Darcy</b></font>) son will be just like him (<font color='blue'><b>Darcy</b></font>)--just
as affable to the poor.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Elizabeth/Miss Bennet/Miss Elizabeth</b></font>)</div><p/>Elizabeth listened, wondered, doubted, and was impatient for more. Mrs.
Reynolds could interest her (<font color='blue'><b>Reynolds</b></font>) on no other point. She (<font color='blue'><b>Reynolds</b></font>) related the subjects
of the pictures, the dimensions of the rooms, and the price of the
furniture, in vain. Mr. Gardiner, highly amused by the kind of family
prejudice to which he (<font color='blue'><b>Gardiner</b></font>) attributed her (<font color='blue'><b>Reynolds</b></font>) excessive commendation of her (<font color='blue'><b>Reynolds</b></font>)
master, soon led again to the subject; and she (<font color='blue'><b>Reynolds</b></font>) dwelt with energy on his (<font color='blue'><b>Gardiner</b></font>)
many merits as they proceeded together up the great staircase.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``He (<font color='blue'><b>Darcy</b></font>) is the best landlord, and the best master,''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>said she (<font color='blue'><b>Reynolds</b></font>), <div class="bookquote">``that ever
lived; not like the wild young men nowadays, who think of nothing but
themselves. There is not one of his (<font color='blue'><b>master</b></font>) tenants or servants but will give
him (<font color='blue'><b>master</b></font>) a good name. Some people call him (<font color='blue'><b>master</b></font>) proud; but I am sure I never saw
anything of it. To my fancy, it is only because he (<font color='blue'><b>master</b></font>) does not rattle away
like other young men.''

 (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``In what an amiable light does this place him (<font color='blue'><b>master</b></font>)!''  (<font color='red'><b>Elizabeth/Miss Bennet/Miss Elizabeth</b></font>)</div>thought Elizabeth.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``This fine account of him (<font color='blue'><b>master</b></font>),''  (<font color='red'><b>aunt</b></font>)</div>whispered her (<font color='blue'><b>Elizabeth</b></font>) aunt as they walked, <div class="bookquote">``is not
quite consistent with his (<font color='blue'><b>master</b></font>) behaviour to our poor friend.''

 (<font color='red'><b>aunt</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Perhaps we might be deceived.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``That is not very likely; our authority was too good.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/>On reaching the spacious lobby above they were shown into a very pretty
sitting-room, lately fitted up with greater elegance and lightness than
the apartments below; and were informed that it was but just done to
give pleasure to Miss Darcy, who had taken a liking to the room when
last at Pemberley.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``He (<font color='blue'><b>master</b></font>) is certainly a good brother,''  (<font color='red'><b>Elizabeth/Miss Bennet/Miss Elizabeth</b></font>)</div>said Elizabeth, as she (<font color='blue'><b>Elizabeth</b></font>) walked towards
one of the windows.

<p/>Mrs. Reynolds anticipated Miss Darcy's delight, when she (<font color='blue'><b>Reynolds</b></font>) should enter
the room. <div class="bookquote">``And this is always the way with him (<font color='blue'><b>master</b></font>),''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Reynolds</b></font>) added. <div class="bookquote">``Whatever
can give his (<font color='blue'><b>master</b></font>) sister any pleasure is sure to be done in a moment. There
is nothing he (<font color='blue'><b>master</b></font>) would not do for her (<font color='blue'><b>sister</b></font>).''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/>The picture-gallery, and two or three of the principal bedrooms, were
all that remained to be shown. In the former were many good paintings;
but Elizabeth knew nothing of the art; and from such as had been already
visible below, she (<font color='blue'><b>Elizabeth</b></font>) had willingly turned to look at some drawings of Miss
Darcy's, in crayons, whose subjects were usually more interesting, and
also more intelligible.

<p/>In the gallery there were many family portraits, but they could have
little to fix the attention of a stranger. Elizabeth walked in quest of
the only face whose features would be known to her (<font color='blue'><b>Elizabeth</b></font>). At last it arrested
her (<font color='blue'><b>Elizabeth</b></font>)--and she (<font color='blue'><b>Elizabeth</b></font>) beheld a striking resemblance to Mr. Darcy, with such a
smile over the face as she (<font color='blue'><b>Elizabeth</b></font>) remembered to have sometimes seen when he (<font color='blue'><b>Darcy</b></font>)
looked at her (<font color='blue'><b>Elizabeth</b></font>). She (<font color='blue'><b>Elizabeth</b></font>) stood several minutes before the picture, in earnest
contemplation, and returned to it again before they quitted the gallery.
Mrs. Reynolds informed them that it had been taken in his (<font color='blue'><b>Darcy</b></font>) father's
lifetime.

<p/>There was certainly at this moment, in Elizabeth's mind, a more gentle
sensation towards the original than she (<font color='blue'><b>Elizabeth</b></font>) had ever felt at the height of
their acquaintance. The commendation bestowed on him (<font color='blue'><b>acquaintance</b></font>) by Mrs. Reynolds
was of no trifling nature. What praise is more valuable than the praise
of an intelligent servant? As a brother, a landlord, a master, she (<font color='blue'><b>Reynolds</b></font>)
considered how many people's happiness were in his (<font color='blue'><b>master</b></font>) guardianship!--how
much of pleasure or pain was it in his (<font color='blue'><b>master</b></font>) power to bestow!--how much of
good or evil must be done by him (<font color='blue'><b>master</b></font>)! Every idea that had been brought
forward by the housekeeper was favourable to his (<font color='blue'><b>master</b></font>) character, and as she (<font color='blue'><b>housekeeper</b></font>)
stood before the canvas on which he (<font color='blue'><b>master</b></font>) was represented, and fixed his (<font color='blue'><b>master</b></font>)
eyes upon herself, she (<font color='blue'><b>housekeeper</b></font>) thought of his (<font color='blue'><b>master</b></font>) regard with a deeper sentiment of
gratitude than it had ever raised before; she (<font color='blue'><b>housekeeper</b></font>) remembered its warmth, and
softened its impropriety of expression.

<p/>When all of the house that was open to general inspection had been seen,
they returned downstairs, and, taking leave of the housekeeper, were
consigned over to the gardener, who met them at the hall-door.

<p/>As they walked across the hall towards the river, Elizabeth turned back
to look again; her (<font color='blue'><b>Elizabeth</b></font>) uncle and aunt stopped also, and while the former
was conjecturing as to the date of the building, the owner of it himself
suddenly came forward from the road, which led behind it to the stables.

<p/>They were within twenty yards of each other, and so abrupt was his (<font color='blue'><b>owner</b></font>)
appearance, that it was impossible to avoid his (<font color='blue'><b>owner</b></font>) sight. Their eyes
instantly met, and the cheeks of both were overspread with the deepest
blush. He (<font color='blue'><b>owner</b></font>) absolutely started, and for a moment seemed immovable from
surprise; but shortly recovering himself, advanced towards the party,
and spoke to Elizabeth, if not in terms of perfect composure, at least
of perfect civility.

<p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>Elizabeth</b></font>) had instinctively turned away; but stopping on his (<font color='blue'><b>owner</b></font>) approach,
received his (<font color='blue'><b>owner</b></font>) compliments with an embarrassment impossible to be
overcome. Had his (<font color='blue'><b>owner</b></font>) first appearance, or his (<font color='blue'><b>owner</b></font>) resemblance to the picture
they had just been examining, been insufficient to assure the other two
that they now saw Mr. Darcy, the gardener's expression of surprise, on
beholding his (<font color='blue'><b>Darcy</b></font>) master, must immediately have told it. They stood a little
aloof while he (<font color='blue'><b>Darcy</b></font>) was talking to their niece, who, astonished and confused,
scarcely dared lift her (<font color='blue'><b>niece</b></font>) eyes to his (<font color='blue'><b>Darcy</b></font>) face, and knew not what answer
she (<font color='blue'><b>niece</b></font>) returned to his (<font color='blue'><b>Darcy</b></font>) civil inquiries after her (<font color='blue'><b>niece</b></font>) family. Amazed at the
alteration of his (<font color='blue'><b>Darcy</b></font>) manner since they last parted, every sentence that
he (<font color='blue'><b>Darcy</b></font>) uttered was increasing her (<font color='blue'><b>niece</b></font>) embarrassment; and every idea of the
impropriety of her (<font color='blue'><b>niece</b></font>) being found there recurring to her (<font color='blue'><b>niece</b></font>) mind, the few
minutes in which they continued were some of the most uncomfortable in
her (<font color='blue'><b>niece</b></font>) life. Nor did he (<font color='blue'><b>Darcy</b></font>) seem much more at ease; when he (<font color='blue'><b>Darcy</b></font>) spoke, his (<font color='blue'><b>Darcy</b></font>) accent
had none of its usual sedateness; and he (<font color='blue'><b>Darcy</b></font>) repeated his (<font color='blue'><b>Darcy</b></font>) inquiries as
to the time of her (<font color='blue'><b>niece</b></font>) having left Longbourn, and of her (<font color='blue'><b>niece</b></font>) having stayed in
Derbyshire, so often, and in so hurried a way, as plainly spoke the
distraction of his (<font color='blue'><b>Darcy</b></font>) thoughts.

<p/>At length every idea seemed to fail him (<font color='blue'><b>Darcy</b></font>); and, after standing a few
moments without saying a word, he (<font color='blue'><b>Darcy</b></font>) suddenly recollected himself, and took
leave.

<p/>The others then joined her (<font color='blue'><b>niece</b></font>), and expressed admiration of his (<font color='blue'><b>Darcy</b></font>) figure; but
Elizabeth heard not a word, and wholly engrossed by her (<font color='blue'><b>Elizabeth</b></font>) own feelings,
followed them in silence. She (<font color='blue'><b>Elizabeth</b></font>) was overpowered by shame and vexation. Her (<font color='blue'><b>Elizabeth</b></font>)
coming there was the most unfortunate, the most ill-judged thing in the
world! How strange it must appear to him (<font color='blue'><b>Darcy</b></font>)! In what a disgraceful light
might it not strike so vain a man! It might seem as if she (<font color='blue'><b>Elizabeth</b></font>) had purposely
thrown herself in his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) way again! Oh! why did she (<font color='blue'><b>Elizabeth</b></font>) come? Or, why did he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>)
thus come a day before he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) was expected? Had they been only ten minutes
sooner, they should have been beyond the reach of his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) discrimination;
for it was plain that he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) was that moment arrived--that moment alighted
from his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) horse or his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) carriage. She (<font color='blue'><b>Elizabeth</b></font>) blushed again and again over
the perverseness of the meeting. And his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) behaviour, so strikingly
altered--what could it mean? That he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) should even speak to her (<font color='blue'><b>Elizabeth</b></font>) was
amazing!--but to speak with such civility, to inquire after her (<font color='blue'><b>Elizabeth</b></font>) family!
Never in her (<font color='blue'><b>Elizabeth</b></font>) life had she (<font color='blue'><b>Elizabeth</b></font>) seen his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) manners so little dignified, never
had he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) spoken with such gentleness as on this unexpected meeting. What
a contrast did it offer to his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) last address in Rosings Park, when he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) put
his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) letter into her (<font color='blue'><b>Elizabeth</b></font>) hand! She (<font color='blue'><b>Elizabeth</b></font>) knew not what to think, or how to account
for it.

<p/>They had now entered a beautiful walk by the side of the water, and
every step was bringing forward a nobler fall of ground, or a finer
reach of the woods to which they were approaching; but it was some time
before Elizabeth was sensible of any of it; and, though she (<font color='blue'><b>Elizabeth</b></font>) answered
mechanically to the repeated appeals of her (<font color='blue'><b>Elizabeth</b></font>) uncle and aunt, and
seemed to direct her (<font color='blue'><b>Elizabeth</b></font>) eyes to such objects as they pointed out, she (<font color='blue'><b>Elizabeth</b></font>)
distinguished no part of the scene. Her (<font color='blue'><b>Elizabeth</b></font>) thoughts were all fixed on that
one spot of Pemberley House, whichever it might be, where Mr. Darcy then
was. She (<font color='blue'><b>Elizabeth</b></font>) longed to know what at the moment was passing in his (<font color='blue'><b>Darcy</b></font>) mind--in
what manner he (<font color='blue'><b>Darcy</b></font>) thought of her (<font color='blue'><b>Elizabeth</b></font>), and whether, in defiance of everything,
she (<font color='blue'><b>Elizabeth</b></font>) was still dear to him (<font color='blue'><b>Darcy</b></font>). Perhaps he (<font color='blue'><b>Darcy</b></font>) had been civil only because he (<font color='blue'><b>Darcy</b></font>)
felt himself at ease; yet there had been _that_ in his (<font color='blue'><b>Darcy</b></font>) voice which was
not like ease. Whether he (<font color='blue'><b>Darcy</b></font>) had felt more of pain or of pleasure in
seeing her (<font color='blue'><b>Elizabeth</b></font>) she (<font color='blue'><b>Elizabeth</b></font>) could not tell, but he (<font color='blue'><b>Darcy</b></font>) certainly had not seen her (<font color='blue'><b>Elizabeth</b></font>) with
composure.

<p/>At length, however, the remarks of her (<font color='blue'><b>Elizabeth</b></font>) companions on her (<font color='blue'><b>Elizabeth</b></font>) absence of mind
aroused her (<font color='blue'><b>Elizabeth</b></font>), and she (<font color='blue'><b>Elizabeth</b></font>) felt the necessity of appearing more like herself.

<p/>They entered the woods, and bidding adieu to the river for a while,
ascended some of the higher grounds; when, in spots where the opening of
the trees gave the eye power to wander, were many charming views of the
valley, the opposite hills, with the long range of woods overspreading
many, and occasionally part of the stream. Mr. Gardiner expressed a wish
of going round the whole park, but feared it might be beyond a walk.
With a triumphant smile they were told that it was ten miles round.
It settled the matter; and they pursued the accustomed circuit; which
brought them again, after some time, in a descent among hanging woods,
to the edge of the water, and one of its narrowest parts. They crossed
it by a simple bridge, in character with the general air of the scene;
it was a spot less adorned than any they had yet visited; and the
valley, here contracted into a glen, allowed room only for the stream,
and a narrow walk amidst the rough coppice-wood which bordered it.
Elizabeth longed to explore its windings; but when they had crossed the
bridge, and perceived their distance from the house, Mrs. Gardiner,
who was not a great walker, could go no farther, and thought only
of returning to the carriage as quickly as possible. Her (<font color='blue'><b>Gardiner</b></font>) niece was,
therefore, obliged to submit, and they took their way towards the house
on the opposite side of the river, in the nearest direction; but their
progress was slow, for Mr. Gardiner, though seldom able to indulge the
taste, was very fond of fishing, and was so much engaged in watching the
occasional appearance of some trout in the water, and talking to the
man about them, that he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) advanced but little. Whilst wandering on in this
slow manner, they were again surprised, and Elizabeth's astonishment
was quite equal to what it had been at first, by the sight of Mr. Darcy
approaching them, and at no great distance. The walk being here
less sheltered than on the other side, allowed them to see him (<font color='blue'><b>Darcy</b></font>) before
they met. Elizabeth, however astonished, was at least more prepared
for an interview than before, and resolved to appear and to speak with
calmness, if he (<font color='blue'><b>Darcy</b></font>) really intended to meet them. For a few moments, indeed,
she (<font color='blue'><b>Elizabeth</b></font>) felt that he (<font color='blue'><b>Darcy</b></font>) would probably strike into some other path. The idea
lasted while a turning in the walk concealed him (<font color='blue'><b>Darcy</b></font>) from their view; the
turning past, he (<font color='blue'><b>Darcy</b></font>) was immediately before them. With a glance, she (<font color='blue'><b>Elizabeth</b></font>) saw
that he (<font color='blue'><b>Darcy</b></font>) had lost none of his (<font color='blue'><b>Darcy</b></font>) recent civility; and, to imitate his (<font color='blue'><b>Darcy</b></font>)
politeness, she (<font color='blue'><b>Elizabeth</b></font>) began, as they met, to admire the beauty of the place;
but she (<font color='blue'><b>Elizabeth</b></font>) had not got beyond the words <div class="bookquote">``delightful,''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>and <div class="bookquote">``charming,''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>when
some unlucky recollections obtruded, and she (<font color='blue'><b>Elizabeth</b></font>) fancied that praise of
Pemberley from her (<font color='blue'><b>Elizabeth</b></font>) might be mischievously construed. Her (<font color='blue'><b>Elizabeth</b></font>) colour changed,
and she (<font color='blue'><b>Elizabeth</b></font>) said no more.

<p/>Mrs. Gardiner was standing a little behind; and on her (<font color='blue'><b>Gardiner</b></font>) pausing, he (<font color='blue'><b>Darcy</b></font>) asked
her (<font color='blue'><b>Gardiner</b></font>) if she (<font color='blue'><b>Gardiner</b></font>) would do him (<font color='blue'><b>Darcy</b></font>) the honour of introducing him (<font color='blue'><b>Darcy</b></font>) to her (<font color='blue'><b>Gardiner</b></font>) friends.
This was a stroke of civility for which she (<font color='blue'><b>Gardiner</b></font>) was quite unprepared;
and she (<font color='blue'><b>Gardiner</b></font>) could hardly suppress a smile at his (<font color='blue'><b>Darcy</b></font>) being now seeking the
acquaintance of some of those very people against whom his (<font color='blue'><b>Darcy</b></font>) pride had
revolted in his (<font color='blue'><b>Darcy</b></font>) offer to herself. <div class="bookquote">``What will be his (<font color='blue'><b>master</b></font>) surprise,''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>thought
she (<font color='blue'><b>Gardiner</b></font>), <div class="bookquote">``when he (<font color='blue'><b>master</b></font>) knows who they are? He (<font color='blue'><b>master</b></font>) takes them now for people of
fashion.''

 (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div><p/>The introduction, however, was immediately made; and as she (<font color='blue'><b>Gardiner</b></font>) named their
relationship to herself, she (<font color='blue'><b>Gardiner</b></font>) stole a sly look at him (<font color='blue'><b>Darcy</b></font>), to see how he (<font color='blue'><b>Darcy</b></font>) bore
it, and was not without the expectation of his (<font color='blue'><b>Darcy</b></font>) decamping as fast as he (<font color='blue'><b>Darcy</b></font>)
could from such disgraceful companions. That he (<font color='blue'><b>Darcy</b></font>) was _surprised_ by the
connection was evident; he (<font color='blue'><b>Darcy</b></font>) sustained it, however, with fortitude, and
so far from going away, turned back with them, and entered into
conversation with Mr. Gardiner. Elizabeth could not but be pleased,
could not but triumph. It was consoling that he (<font color='blue'><b>Gardiner</b></font>) should know she (<font color='blue'><b>Elizabeth</b></font>) had
some relations for whom there was no need to blush. She (<font color='blue'><b>Elizabeth</b></font>) listened most
attentively to all that passed between them, and gloried in every
expression, every sentence of her (<font color='blue'><b>Elizabeth</b></font>) uncle, which marked his (<font color='blue'><b>uncle</b></font>) intelligence,
his (<font color='blue'><b>uncle</b></font>) taste, or his (<font color='blue'><b>uncle</b></font>) good manners.

<p/>The conversation soon turned upon fishing; and she (<font color='blue'><b>Elizabeth</b></font>) heard Mr. Darcy
invite him (<font color='blue'><b>Darcy</b></font>), with the greatest civility, to fish there as often as he (<font color='blue'><b>Darcy</b></font>)
chose while he (<font color='blue'><b>Darcy</b></font>) continued in the neighbourhood, offering at the same time
to supply him (<font color='blue'><b>Darcy</b></font>) with fishing tackle, and pointing out those parts of
the stream where there was usually most sport. Mrs. Gardiner, who was
walking arm-in-arm with Elizabeth, gave her (<font color='blue'><b>Elizabeth</b></font>) a look expressive of wonder.
Elizabeth said nothing, but it gratified her (<font color='blue'><b>Elizabeth</b></font>) exceedingly; the compliment
must be all for herself. Her (<font color='blue'><b>Elizabeth</b></font>) astonishment, however, was extreme, and
continually was she (<font color='blue'><b>Elizabeth</b></font>) repeating, <div class="bookquote">``Why is he (<font color='blue'><b>master</b></font>) so altered? From what can
it proceed? It cannot be for _me_--it cannot be for _my_ sake that his (<font color='blue'><b>master</b></font>)
manners are thus softened. My reproofs at Hunsford could not work such a
change as this. It is impossible that he (<font color='blue'><b>master</b></font>) should still love me.''

 (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div><p/>After walking some time in this way, the two ladies in front, the two
gentlemen behind, on resuming their places, after descending to
the brink of the river for the better inspection of some curious
water-plant, there chanced to be a little alteration. It originated
in Mrs. Gardiner, who, fatigued by the exercise of the morning, found
Elizabeth's arm inadequate to her (<font color='blue'><b>Elizabeth</b></font>) support, and consequently preferred
her (<font color='blue'><b>Elizabeth</b></font>) husband's. Mr. Darcy took her (<font color='blue'><b>Elizabeth</b></font>) place by her (<font color='blue'><b>Elizabeth</b></font>) niece, and they walked on
together. After a short silence, the lady first spoke. She (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) wished him (<font color='blue'><b>Darcy</b></font>)
to know that she (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) had been assured of his (<font color='blue'><b>Darcy</b></font>) absence before she (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) came to the
place, and accordingly began by observing, that his (<font color='blue'><b>Darcy</b></font>) arrival had been
very unexpected--<div class="bookquote">``for your housekeeper,''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) added, <div class="bookquote">``informed us that
you would certainly not be here till to-morrow; and indeed, before we
left Bakewell, we understood that you were not immediately expected
in the country.''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>He (<font color='blue'><b>Darcy</b></font>) acknowledged the truth of it all, and said that
business with his (<font color='blue'><b>Darcy</b></font>) steward had occasioned his (<font color='blue'><b>Darcy</b></font>) coming forward a few hours
before the rest of the party with whom he (<font color='blue'><b>Darcy</b></font>) had been travelling. <div class="bookquote">``They
will join me early to-morrow,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Darcy</b></font>) continued, <div class="bookquote">``and among them are some
who will claim an acquaintance with you--Mr. Bingley and his (<font color='blue'><b>Bingley</b></font>) sisters.''

 (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div><p/>Elizabeth answered only by a slight bow. Her (<font color='blue'><b>Elizabeth</b></font>) thoughts were instantly
driven back to the time when Mr. Bingley's name had been the last
mentioned between them; and, if she (<font color='blue'><b>Elizabeth</b></font>) might judge by his (<font color='blue'><b>Bingley</b></font>) complexion, _his (<font color='blue'><b>Bingley</b></font>)_
mind was not very differently engaged.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``There is also one other person in the party,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Bingley</b></font>) continued after a
pause, <div class="bookquote">``who more particularly wishes to be known to you. Will you allow
me, or do I ask too much, to introduce my sister to your acquaintance
during your stay at Lambton?''

 (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div><p/>The surprise of such an application was great indeed; it was too great
for her (<font color='blue'><b>Elizabeth</b></font>) to know in what manner she (<font color='blue'><b>Elizabeth</b></font>) acceded to it. She (<font color='blue'><b>Elizabeth</b></font>) immediately felt
that whatever desire Miss Darcy might have of being acquainted with her (<font color='blue'><b>Darcy</b></font>)
must be the work of her (<font color='blue'><b>Darcy</b></font>) brother, and, without looking farther, it was
satisfactory; it was gratifying to know that his (<font color='blue'><b>brother</b></font>) resentment had not made
him (<font color='blue'><b>brother</b></font>) think really ill of her (<font color='blue'><b>Darcy</b></font>).

<p/>They now walked on in silence, each of them deep in thought. Elizabeth
was not comfortable; that was impossible; but she (<font color='blue'><b>Elizabeth</b></font>) was flattered and
pleased. His (<font color='blue'><b>brother</b></font>) wish of introducing his (<font color='blue'><b>brother</b></font>) sister to her (<font color='blue'><b>Elizabeth</b></font>) was a compliment of
the highest kind. They soon outstripped the others, and when they had
reached the carriage, Mr. and Mrs. Gardiner were half a quarter of a
mile behind.

<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>brother</b></font>) then asked her (<font color='blue'><b>Gardiner</b></font>) to walk into the house--but she (<font color='blue'><b>Gardiner</b></font>) declared herself not
tired, and they stood together on the lawn. At such a time much might
have been said, and silence was very awkward. She (<font color='blue'><b>Gardiner</b></font>) wanted to talk, but
there seemed to be an embargo on every subject. At last she (<font color='blue'><b>Gardiner</b></font>) recollected
that she (<font color='blue'><b>Gardiner</b></font>) had been travelling, and they talked of Matlock and Dove Dale
with great perseverance. Yet time and her (<font color='blue'><b>Gardiner</b></font>) aunt moved slowly--and her (<font color='blue'><b>Gardiner</b></font>)
patience and her (<font color='blue'><b>Gardiner</b></font>) ideas were nearly worn out before the tete-a-tete was
over. On Mr. and Mrs. Gardiner's coming up they were all pressed to go
into the house and take some refreshment; but this was declined, and
they parted on each side with utmost politeness. Mr. Darcy handed the
ladies into the carriage; and when it drove off, Elizabeth saw him (<font color='blue'><b>Darcy</b></font>)
walking slowly towards the house.

<p/>The observations of her (<font color='blue'><b>Elizabeth</b></font>) uncle and aunt now began; and each of them
pronounced him (<font color='blue'><b>Darcy</b></font>) to be infinitely superior to anything they had expected.
<div class="bookquote">``He (<font color='blue'><b>acquaintance</b></font>) is perfectly well behaved, polite, and unassuming,''  (<font color='red'><b>uncle</b></font>)</div>said her (<font color='blue'><b>Elizabeth</b></font>) uncle.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``There _is_ something a little stately in him (<font color='blue'><b>acquaintance</b></font>), to be sure,''  (<font color='red'><b>aunt</b></font>)</div>replied her (<font color='blue'><b>Elizabeth</b></font>)
aunt, <div class="bookquote">``but it is confined to his (<font color='blue'><b>acquaintance</b></font>) air, and is not unbecoming. I can now
say with the housekeeper, that though some people may call him (<font color='blue'><b>acquaintance</b></font>) proud, I
have seen nothing of it.''

 (<font color='red'><b>aunt</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I was never more surprised than by his (<font color='blue'><b>acquaintance</b></font>) behaviour to us. It was more
than civil; it was really attentive; and there was no necessity for such
attention. His (<font color='blue'><b>acquaintance</b></font>) acquaintance with Elizabeth was very trifling.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``To be sure, Lizzy,''  (<font color='red'><b>aunt</b></font>)</div>said her (<font color='blue'><b>Elizabeth</b></font>) aunt, <div class="bookquote">``he (<font color='blue'><b>acquaintance</b></font>) is not so handsome as Wickham;
or, rather, he (<font color='blue'><b>Wickham</b></font>) has not Wickham's countenance, for his (<font color='blue'><b>Wickham</b></font>) features
are perfectly good. But how came you to tell me that he (<font color='blue'><b>Wickham</b></font>) was so
disagreeable?''

 (<font color='red'><b>aunt</b></font>)</div><p/>Elizabeth excused herself as well as she (<font color='blue'><b>Elizabeth</b></font>) could; said that she (<font color='blue'><b>Elizabeth</b></font>) had liked
him (<font color='blue'><b>uncle</b></font>) better when they had met in Kent than before, and that she (<font color='blue'><b>Elizabeth</b></font>) had never
seen him (<font color='blue'><b>uncle</b></font>) so pleasant as this morning.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``But perhaps he (<font color='blue'><b>Wickham</b></font>) may be a little whimsical in his (<font color='blue'><b>Wickham</b></font>) civilities,''  (<font color='red'><b>uncle</b></font>)</div>replied
her (<font color='blue'><b>Elizabeth</b></font>) uncle. <div class="bookquote">``Your great men often are; and therefore I shall not take him (<font color='blue'><b>Wickham</b></font>)
at his (<font color='blue'><b>Wickham</b></font>) word, as he (<font color='blue'><b>Wickham</b></font>) might change his (<font color='blue'><b>Wickham</b></font>) mind another day, and warn me off
his (<font color='blue'><b>Wickham</b></font>) grounds.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Elizabeth/Miss Bennet/Miss Elizabeth</b></font>)</div><p/>Elizabeth felt that they had entirely misunderstood his (<font color='blue'><b>uncle</b></font>) character, but
said nothing.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``From what we have seen of him (<font color='blue'><b>Wickham</b></font>),''  (<font color='red'><b>Mrs. Gardiner/Gardiner/GARDINER</b></font>)</div>continued Mrs. Gardiner, <div class="bookquote">``I really
should not have thought that he (<font color='blue'><b>Wickham</b></font>) could have behaved in so cruel a way by
anybody as he (<font color='blue'><b>Wickham</b></font>) has done by poor Wickham. He (<font color='blue'><b>Wickham</b></font>) has not an ill-natured look.
On the contrary, there is something pleasing about his (<font color='blue'><b>Wickham</b></font>) mouth when he (<font color='blue'><b>Wickham</b></font>)
speaks. And there is something of dignity in his (<font color='blue'><b>Wickham</b></font>) countenance that would
not give one an unfavourable idea of his (<font color='blue'><b>Wickham</b></font>) heart. But, to be sure, the
good lady who showed us his (<font color='blue'><b>Wickham</b></font>) house did give him (<font color='blue'><b>Wickham</b></font>) a most flaming character!
I could hardly help laughing aloud sometimes. But he (<font color='blue'><b>Wickham</b></font>) is a liberal
master, I suppose, and _that_ in the eye of a servant comprehends every
virtue.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Mrs. Gardiner/Gardiner/GARDINER</b></font>)</div><p/>Elizabeth here felt herself called on to say something in vindication of
his (<font color='blue'><b>uncle</b></font>) behaviour to Wickham; and therefore gave them to understand, in
as guarded a manner as she (<font color='blue'><b>Elizabeth</b></font>) could, that by what she (<font color='blue'><b>Elizabeth</b></font>) had heard from
his (<font color='blue'><b>Wickham</b></font>) relations in Kent, his (<font color='blue'><b>Wickham</b></font>) actions were capable of a very different
construction; and that his (<font color='blue'><b>Wickham</b></font>) character was by no means so faulty, nor
Wickham's so amiable, as they had been considered in Hertfordshire. In
confirmation of this, she (<font color='blue'><b>Elizabeth</b></font>) related the particulars of all the pecuniary
transactions in which they had been connected, without actually naming
her (<font color='blue'><b>Elizabeth</b></font>) authority, but stating it to be such as might be relied on.

<p/>Mrs. Gardiner was surprised and concerned; but as they were now
approaching the scene of her (<font color='blue'><b>Gardiner</b></font>) former pleasures, every idea gave way to
the charm of recollection; and she (<font color='blue'><b>Gardiner</b></font>) was too much engaged in pointing out
to her (<font color='blue'><b>Gardiner</b></font>) husband all the interesting spots in its environs to think of
anything else. Fatigued as she (<font color='blue'><b>Gardiner</b></font>) had been by the morning's walk they
had no sooner dined than she (<font color='blue'><b>Gardiner</b></font>) set off again in quest of her (<font color='blue'><b>Gardiner</b></font>) former
acquaintance, and the evening was spent in the satisfactions of a
intercourse renewed after many years' discontinuance.

<p/>The occurrences of the day were too full of interest to leave Elizabeth
much attention for any of these new friends; and she (<font color='blue'><b>Elizabeth</b></font>) could do nothing
but think, and think with wonder, of Mr. Darcy's civility, and, above
all, of his (<font color='blue'><b>Darcy</b></font>) wishing her (<font color='blue'><b>Elizabeth</b></font>) to be acquainted with his (<font color='blue'><b>Darcy</b></font>) sister.



<p/>Chapter 44


<p/>Elizabeth had settled it that Mr. Darcy would bring his (<font color='blue'><b>Darcy</b></font>) sister to visit
her (<font color='blue'><b>Elizabeth</b></font>) the very day after her (<font color='blue'><b>Elizabeth</b></font>) reaching Pemberley; and was consequently
resolved not to be out of sight of the inn the whole of that morning.
But her (<font color='blue'><b>Elizabeth</b></font>) conclusion was false; for on the very morning after their
arrival at Lambton, these visitors came. They had been walking about the
place with some of their new friends, and were just returning to the inn
to dress themselves for dining with the same family, when the sound of a
carriage drew them to a window, and they saw a gentleman and a lady in
a curricle driving up the street. Elizabeth immediately recognizing
the livery, guessed what it meant, and imparted no small degree of her (<font color='blue'><b>Elizabeth</b></font>)
surprise to her (<font color='blue'><b>Elizabeth</b></font>) relations by acquainting them with the honour which she (<font color='blue'><b>Elizabeth</b></font>)
expected. Her (<font color='blue'><b>Elizabeth</b></font>) uncle and aunt were all amazement; and the embarrassment
of her (<font color='blue'><b>Elizabeth</b></font>) manner as she (<font color='blue'><b>Elizabeth</b></font>) spoke, joined to the circumstance itself, and many
of the circumstances of the preceding day, opened to them a new idea on
the business. Nothing had ever suggested it before, but they felt that
there was no other way of accounting for such attentions from such a
quarter than by supposing a partiality for their niece. While these
newly-born notions were passing in their heads, the perturbation of
Elizabeth's feelings was at every moment increasing. She (<font color='blue'><b>Elizabeth</b></font>) was quite
amazed at her (<font color='blue'><b>Elizabeth</b></font>) own discomposure; but amongst other causes of disquiet,
she (<font color='blue'><b>Elizabeth</b></font>) dreaded lest the partiality of the brother should have said too much
in her (<font color='blue'><b>Elizabeth</b></font>) favour; and, more than commonly anxious to please, she (<font color='blue'><b>Elizabeth</b></font>) naturally
suspected that every power of pleasing would fail her (<font color='blue'><b>Elizabeth</b></font>).

<p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>Elizabeth</b></font>) retreated from the window, fearful of being seen; and as she (<font color='blue'><b>Elizabeth</b></font>) walked
up and down the room, endeavouring to compose herself, saw such looks of
inquiring surprise in her (<font color='blue'><b>Elizabeth</b></font>) uncle and aunt as made everything worse.

<p/>Miss Darcy and her (<font color='blue'><b>Darcy</b></font>) brother appeared, and this formidable introduction
took place. With astonishment did Elizabeth see that her (<font color='blue'><b>Elizabeth</b></font>) new
acquaintance was at least as much embarrassed as herself. Since her (<font color='blue'><b>Elizabeth</b></font>)
being at Lambton, she (<font color='blue'><b>Elizabeth</b></font>) had heard that Miss Darcy was exceedingly proud;
but the observation of a very few minutes convinced her (<font color='blue'><b>Darcy</b></font>) that she (<font color='blue'><b>Darcy</b></font>) was
only exceedingly shy. She (<font color='blue'><b>Darcy</b></font>) found it difficult to obtain even a word from
her (<font color='blue'><b>Darcy</b></font>) beyond a monosyllable.

<p/>Miss Darcy was tall, and on a larger scale than Elizabeth; and, though
little more than sixteen, her (<font color='blue'><b>Elizabeth</b></font>) figure was formed, and her (<font color='blue'><b>Elizabeth</b></font>) appearance
womanly and graceful. She (<font color='blue'><b>Elizabeth</b></font>) was less handsome than her (<font color='blue'><b>Elizabeth</b></font>) brother; but there
was sense and good humour in her (<font color='blue'><b>Elizabeth</b></font>) face, and her (<font color='blue'><b>Elizabeth</b></font>) manners were perfectly
unassuming and gentle. Elizabeth, who had expected to find in her (<font color='blue'><b>Elizabeth</b></font>) as
acute and unembarrassed an observer as ever Mr. Darcy had been, was much
relieved by discerning such different feelings.

<p/>They had not long been together before Mr. Darcy told her (<font color='blue'><b>Elizabeth</b></font>) that Bingley
was also coming to wait on her (<font color='blue'><b>Elizabeth</b></font>); and she (<font color='blue'><b>Elizabeth</b></font>) had barely time to express her (<font color='blue'><b>Elizabeth</b></font>)
satisfaction, and prepare for such a visitor, when Bingley's quick
step was heard on the stairs, and in a moment he (<font color='blue'><b>Bingley</b></font>) entered the room. All
Elizabeth's anger against him (<font color='blue'><b>Bingley</b></font>) had been long done away; but had she (<font color='blue'><b>Elizabeth</b></font>) still
felt any, it could hardly have stood its ground against the unaffected
cordiality with which he (<font color='blue'><b>Bingley</b></font>) expressed himself on seeing her (<font color='blue'><b>Elizabeth</b></font>) again. He (<font color='blue'><b>Bingley</b></font>)
inquired in a friendly, though general way, after her (<font color='blue'><b>Elizabeth</b></font>) family, and looked
and spoke with the same good-humoured ease that he (<font color='blue'><b>Bingley</b></font>) had ever done.

<p/>To Mr. and Mrs. Gardiner he (<font color='blue'><b>Bingley</b></font>) was scarcely a less interesting personage
than to herself. They had long wished to see him (<font color='blue'><b>Bingley</b></font>). The whole party before
them, indeed, excited a lively attention. The suspicions which had just
arisen of Mr. Darcy and their niece directed their observation towards
each with an earnest though guarded inquiry; and they soon drew from
those inquiries the full conviction that one of them at least knew
what it was to love. Of the lady's sensations they remained a little
in doubt; but that the gentleman was overflowing with admiration was
evident enough.

<p/>Elizabeth, on her (<font color='blue'><b>Elizabeth</b></font>) side, had much to do. She (<font color='blue'><b>Elizabeth</b></font>) wanted to ascertain the
feelings of each of her (<font color='blue'><b>Elizabeth</b></font>) visitors; she (<font color='blue'><b>Elizabeth</b></font>) wanted to compose her (<font color='blue'><b>Elizabeth</b></font>) own, and
to make herself agreeable to all; and in the latter object, where she (<font color='blue'><b>Elizabeth</b></font>)
feared most to fail, she (<font color='blue'><b>Elizabeth</b></font>) was most sure of success, for those to whom she (<font color='blue'><b>Elizabeth</b></font>)
endeavoured to give pleasure were prepossessed in her (<font color='blue'><b>Elizabeth</b></font>) favour. Bingley
was ready, Georgiana was eager, and Darcy determined, to be pleased.

<p/>In seeing Bingley, her (<font color='blue'><b>Georgiana</b></font>) thoughts naturally flew to her (<font color='blue'><b>Georgiana</b></font>) sister; and, oh!
how ardently did she (<font color='blue'><b>Georgiana</b></font>) long to know whether any of his (<font color='blue'><b>Bingley</b></font>) were directed in
a like manner. Sometimes she (<font color='blue'><b>Georgiana</b></font>) could fancy that he (<font color='blue'><b>Bingley</b></font>) talked less than on
former occasions, and once or twice pleased herself with the notion
that, as he (<font color='blue'><b>Bingley</b></font>) looked at her (<font color='blue'><b>Georgiana</b></font>), he (<font color='blue'><b>Bingley</b></font>) was trying to trace a resemblance. But,
though this might be imaginary, she (<font color='blue'><b>Georgiana</b></font>) could not be deceived as to his (<font color='blue'><b>Bingley</b></font>)
behaviour to Miss Darcy, who had been set up as a rival to Jane. No look
appeared on either side that spoke particular regard. Nothing occurred
between them that could justify the hopes of his (<font color='blue'><b>Bingley</b></font>) sister. On this point
she (<font color='blue'><b>sister</b></font>) was soon satisfied; and two or three little circumstances occurred
ere they parted, which, in her (<font color='blue'><b>sister</b></font>) anxious interpretation, denoted a
recollection of Jane not untinctured by tenderness, and a wish of saying
more that might lead to the mention of her (<font color='blue'><b>Jane</b></font>), had he (<font color='blue'><b>Bingley</b></font>) dared. He (<font color='blue'><b>Bingley</b></font>) observed
to her (<font color='blue'><b>Jane</b></font>), at a moment when the others were talking together, and in a tone
which had something of real regret, that it <div class="bookquote">``was a very long time since
he (<font color='blue'><b>servant</b></font>) had had the pleasure of seeing her (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>);''  (<font color='red'><b>the others</b></font>)</div>and, before she (<font color='blue'><b>Jane</b></font>) could reply,
he (<font color='blue'><b>Bingley</b></font>) added, <div class="bookquote">``It is above eight months. We have not met since the 26th of
November, when we were all dancing together at Netherfield.''

 (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div><p/>Elizabeth was pleased to find his (<font color='blue'><b>Bingley</b></font>) memory so exact; and he (<font color='blue'><b>Bingley</b></font>) afterwards
took occasion to ask her (<font color='blue'><b>Elizabeth</b></font>), when unattended to by any of the rest, whether
_all_ her (<font color='blue'><b>Elizabeth</b></font>) sisters were at Longbourn. There was not much in the question,
nor in the preceding remark; but there was a look and a manner which
gave them meaning.

<p/>It was not often that she (<font color='blue'><b>Elizabeth</b></font>) could turn her (<font color='blue'><b>Elizabeth</b></font>) eyes on Mr. Darcy himself;
but, whenever she (<font color='blue'><b>Elizabeth</b></font>) did catch a glimpse, she (<font color='blue'><b>Elizabeth</b></font>) saw an expression of general
complaisance, and in all that he (<font color='blue'><b>Darcy</b></font>) said she (<font color='blue'><b>Elizabeth</b></font>) heard an accent so removed
from _hauteur_ or disdain of his (<font color='blue'><b>Darcy</b></font>) companions, as convinced her (<font color='blue'><b>Elizabeth</b></font>) that
the improvement of manners which she (<font color='blue'><b>Elizabeth</b></font>) had yesterday witnessed however
temporary its existence might prove, had at least outlived one day. When
she (<font color='blue'><b>Elizabeth</b></font>) saw him (<font color='blue'><b>Darcy</b></font>) thus seeking the acquaintance and courting the good opinion
of people with whom any intercourse a few months ago would have been a
disgrace--when she (<font color='blue'><b>Elizabeth</b></font>) saw him (<font color='blue'><b>Darcy</b></font>) thus civil, not only to herself, but to the
very relations whom he (<font color='blue'><b>Darcy</b></font>) had openly disdained, and recollected their last
lively scene in Hunsford Parsonage--the difference, the change was
so great, and struck so forcibly on her (<font color='blue'><b>Elizabeth</b></font>) mind, that she (<font color='blue'><b>Elizabeth</b></font>) could hardly
restrain her (<font color='blue'><b>Elizabeth</b></font>) astonishment from being visible. Never, even in the company
of his (<font color='blue'><b>Darcy</b></font>) dear friends at Netherfield, or his (<font color='blue'><b>Darcy</b></font>) dignified relations
at Rosings, had she (<font color='blue'><b>Elizabeth</b></font>) seen him (<font color='blue'><b>Darcy</b></font>) so desirous to please, so free from
self-consequence or unbending reserve, as now, when no importance
could result from the success of his (<font color='blue'><b>Darcy</b></font>) endeavours, and when even the
acquaintance of those to whom his (<font color='blue'><b>acquaintance</b></font>) attentions were addressed would draw
down the ridicule and censure of the ladies both of Netherfield and
Rosings.

<p/>Their visitors stayed with them above half-an-hour; and when they arose
to depart, Mr. Darcy called on his (<font color='blue'><b>Darcy</b></font>) sister to join him (<font color='blue'><b>Darcy</b></font>) in expressing
their wish of seeing Mr. and Mrs. Gardiner, and Miss Bennet, to dinner
at Pemberley, before they left the country. Miss Darcy, though with a
diffidence which marked her (<font color='blue'><b>Darcy</b></font>) little in the habit of giving invitations,
readily obeyed. Mrs. Gardiner looked at her (<font color='blue'><b>Gardiner</b></font>) niece, desirous of knowing
how _she (<font color='blue'><b>Gardiner</b></font>)_, whom the invitation most concerned, felt disposed as to its
acceptance, but Elizabeth had turned away her (<font color='blue'><b>Elizabeth</b></font>) head. Presuming however,
that this studied avoidance spoke rather a momentary embarrassment than
any dislike of the proposal, and seeing in her (<font color='blue'><b>Elizabeth</b></font>) husband, who was fond of
society, a perfect willingness to accept it, she (<font color='blue'><b>Elizabeth</b></font>) ventured to engage for
her (<font color='blue'><b>Elizabeth</b></font>) attendance, and the day after the next was fixed on.

<p/>Bingley expressed great pleasure in the certainty of seeing Elizabeth
again, having still a great deal to say to her (<font color='blue'><b>Elizabeth</b></font>), and many inquiries to
make after all their Hertfordshire friends. Elizabeth, construing all
this into a wish of hearing her (<font color='blue'><b>Elizabeth</b></font>) speak of her (<font color='blue'><b>Elizabeth</b></font>) sister, was pleased, and on
this account, as well as some others, found herself, when their
visitors left them, capable of considering the last half-hour with some
satisfaction, though while it was passing, the enjoyment of it had been
little. Eager to be alone, and fearful of inquiries or hints from her (<font color='blue'><b>Elizabeth</b></font>)
uncle and aunt, she (<font color='blue'><b>Elizabeth</b></font>) stayed with them only long enough to hear their
favourable opinion of Bingley, and then hurried away to dress.

<p/>But she (<font color='blue'><b>Elizabeth</b></font>) had no reason to fear Mr. and Mrs. Gardiner's curiosity; it was
not their wish to force her (<font color='blue'><b>Gardiner</b></font>) communication. It was evident that she (<font color='blue'><b>Gardiner</b></font>) was
much better acquainted with Mr. Darcy than they had before any idea of;
it was evident that he (<font color='blue'><b>Darcy</b></font>) was very much in love with her (<font color='blue'><b>Gardiner</b></font>). They saw much to
interest, but nothing to justify inquiry.

<p/>Of Mr. Darcy it was now a matter of anxiety to think well; and, as far
as their acquaintance reached, there was no fault to find. They could
not be untouched by his (<font color='blue'><b>acquaintance</b></font>) politeness; and had they drawn his (<font color='blue'><b>acquaintance</b></font>) character
from their own feelings and his (<font color='blue'><b>acquaintance</b></font>) servant's report, without any reference
to any other account, the circle in Hertfordshire to which he (<font color='blue'><b>acquaintance</b></font>) was known
would not have recognized it for Mr. Darcy. There was now an interest,
however, in believing the housekeeper; and they soon became sensible
that the authority of a servant who had known him (<font color='blue'><b>servant</b></font>) since he (<font color='blue'><b>servant</b></font>) was four
years old, and whose own manners indicated respectability, was not to be
hastily rejected. Neither had anything occurred in the intelligence of
their Lambton friends that could materially lessen its weight. They had
nothing to accuse him (<font color='blue'><b>servant</b></font>) of but pride; pride he (<font color='blue'><b>servant</b></font>) probably had, and if not,
it would certainly be imputed by the inhabitants of a small market-town
where the family did not visit. It was acknowledged, however, that he (<font color='blue'><b>servant</b></font>)
was a liberal man, and did much good among the poor.

<p/>With respect to Wickham, the travellers soon found that he (<font color='blue'><b>Wickham</b></font>) was not held
there in much estimation; for though the chief of his (<font color='blue'><b>chief</b></font>) concerns with the
son of his (<font color='blue'><b>chief</b></font>) patron were imperfectly understood, it was yet a well-known
fact that, on his (<font color='blue'><b>chief</b></font>) quitting Derbyshire, he (<font color='blue'><b>chief</b></font>) had left many debts behind
him (<font color='blue'><b>chief</b></font>), which Mr. Darcy afterwards discharged.

<p/>As for Elizabeth, her (<font color='blue'><b>Elizabeth</b></font>) thoughts were at Pemberley this evening more than
the last; and the evening, though as it passed it seemed long, was not
long enough to determine her (<font color='blue'><b>Elizabeth</b></font>) feelings towards _one_ in that mansion;
and she (<font color='blue'><b>Elizabeth</b></font>) lay awake two whole hours endeavouring to make them out. She (<font color='blue'><b>Elizabeth</b></font>)
certainly did not hate him (<font color='blue'><b>Darcy</b></font>). No; hatred had vanished long ago, and she (<font color='blue'><b>Elizabeth</b></font>)
had almost as long been ashamed of ever feeling a dislike against him (<font color='blue'><b>Darcy</b></font>),
that could be so called. The respect created by the conviction of his (<font color='blue'><b>Darcy</b></font>)
valuable qualities, though at first unwillingly admitted, had for some
time ceased to be repugnant to her (<font color='blue'><b>Elizabeth</b></font>) feeling; and it was now heightened
into somewhat of a friendlier nature, by the testimony so highly in
his (<font color='blue'><b>Darcy</b></font>) favour, and bringing forward his (<font color='blue'><b>Darcy</b></font>) disposition in so amiable a light,
which yesterday had produced. But above all, above respect and esteem,
there was a motive within her (<font color='blue'><b>Elizabeth</b></font>) of goodwill which could not be overlooked.
It was gratitude; gratitude, not merely for having once loved her (<font color='blue'><b>Elizabeth</b></font>),
but for loving her (<font color='blue'><b>Elizabeth</b></font>) still well enough to forgive all the petulance and
acrimony of her (<font color='blue'><b>Elizabeth</b></font>) manner in rejecting him (<font color='blue'><b>Darcy</b></font>), and all the unjust accusations
accompanying her (<font color='blue'><b>Elizabeth</b></font>) rejection. He (<font color='blue'><b>Darcy</b></font>) who, she (<font color='blue'><b>Elizabeth</b></font>) had been persuaded, would avoid
her (<font color='blue'><b>Elizabeth</b></font>) as his (<font color='blue'><b>Darcy</b></font>) greatest enemy, seemed, on this accidental meeting, most
eager to preserve the acquaintance, and without any indelicate display
of regard, or any peculiarity of manner, where their two selves only
were concerned, was soliciting the good opinion of her (<font color='blue'><b>Elizabeth</b></font>) friends, and bent
on making her (<font color='blue'><b>Elizabeth</b></font>) known to his (<font color='blue'><b>Darcy</b></font>) sister. Such a change in a man of so much
pride exciting not only astonishment but gratitude--for to love, ardent
love, it must be attributed; and as such its impression on her (<font color='blue'><b>Elizabeth</b></font>) was of a
sort to be encouraged, as by no means unpleasing, though it could not be
exactly defined. She (<font color='blue'><b>Elizabeth</b></font>) respected, she (<font color='blue'><b>Elizabeth</b></font>) esteemed, she (<font color='blue'><b>Elizabeth</b></font>) was grateful to him (<font color='blue'><b>Darcy</b></font>),
she (<font color='blue'><b>Elizabeth</b></font>) felt a real interest in his (<font color='blue'><b>Darcy</b></font>) welfare; and she (<font color='blue'><b>Elizabeth</b></font>) only wanted to know how
far she (<font color='blue'><b>Elizabeth</b></font>) wished that welfare to depend upon herself, and how far it would
be for the happiness of both that she (<font color='blue'><b>Elizabeth</b></font>) should employ the power, which her (<font color='blue'><b>Elizabeth</b></font>)
fancy told her (<font color='blue'><b>Elizabeth</b></font>) she (<font color='blue'><b>Elizabeth</b></font>) still possessed, of bringing on her (<font color='blue'><b>Elizabeth</b></font>) the renewal of
his (<font color='blue'><b>Darcy</b></font>) addresses.

<p/>It had been settled in the evening between the aunt and the niece, that
such a striking civility as Miss Darcy's in coming to see them on the
very day of her (<font color='blue'><b>Darcy</b></font>) arrival at Pemberley, for she (<font color='blue'><b>Darcy</b></font>) had reached it only to a
late breakfast, ought to be imitated, though it could not be equalled,
by some exertion of politeness on their side; and, consequently, that
it would be highly expedient to wait on her (<font color='blue'><b>Darcy</b></font>) at Pemberley the following
morning. They were, therefore, to go. Elizabeth was pleased; though when
she (<font color='blue'><b>Elizabeth</b></font>) asked herself the reason, she (<font color='blue'><b>Elizabeth</b></font>) had very little to say in reply.

<p/>Mr. Gardiner left them soon after breakfast. The fishing scheme had been
renewed the day before, and a positive engagement made of his (<font color='blue'><b>Gardiner</b></font>) meeting
some of the gentlemen at Pemberley before noon.



<p/>Chapter 45


<p/>Convinced as Elizabeth now was that Miss Bingley's dislike of her (<font color='blue'><b>Bingley</b></font>) had
originated in jealousy, she (<font color='blue'><b>Bingley</b></font>) could not help feeling how unwelcome her (<font color='blue'><b>Bingley</b></font>)
appearance at Pemberley must be to her (<font color='blue'><b>Bingley</b></font>), and was curious to know with how
much civility on that lady's side the acquaintance would now be renewed.

<p/>On reaching the house, they were shown through the hall into the saloon,
whose northern aspect rendered it delightful for summer. Its windows
opening to the ground, admitted a most refreshing view of the high woody
hills behind the house, and of the beautiful oaks and Spanish chestnuts
which were scattered over the intermediate lawn.

<p/>In this house they were received by Miss Darcy, who was sitting there
with Mrs. Hurst and Miss Bingley, and the lady with whom she (<font color='blue'><b>Bingley</b></font>) lived in
London. Georgiana's reception of them was very civil, but attended with
all the embarrassment which, though proceeding from shyness and the fear
of doing wrong, would easily give to those who felt themselves inferior
the belief of her (<font color='blue'><b>Bingley</b></font>) being proud and reserved. Mrs. Gardiner and her (<font color='blue'><b>Gardiner</b></font>) niece,
however, did her (<font color='blue'><b>Gardiner</b></font>) justice, and pitied her (<font color='blue'><b>Gardiner</b></font>).

<p/>By Mrs. Hurst and Miss Bingley they were noticed only by a curtsey; and,
on their being seated, a pause, awkward as such pauses must always be,
succeeded for a few moments. It was first broken by Mrs. Annesley, a
genteel, agreeable-looking woman, whose endeavour to introduce some kind
of discourse proved her (<font color='blue'><b>Annesley</b></font>) to be more truly well-bred than either of the
others; and between her (<font color='blue'><b>Annesley</b></font>) and Mrs. Gardiner, with occasional help from
Elizabeth, the conversation was carried on. Miss Darcy looked as if she (<font color='blue'><b>Darcy</b></font>)
wished for courage enough to join in it; and sometimes did venture a
short sentence when there was least danger of its being heard.

<p/>Elizabeth soon saw that she (<font color='blue'><b>Elizabeth</b></font>) was herself closely watched by Miss Bingley,
and that she (<font color='blue'><b>Bingley</b></font>) could not speak a word, especially to Miss Darcy, without
calling her (<font color='blue'><b>Darcy</b></font>) attention. This observation would not have prevented her (<font color='blue'><b>Darcy</b></font>)
from trying to talk to the latter, had they not been seated at an
inconvenient distance; but she (<font color='blue'><b>Darcy</b></font>) was not sorry to be spared the necessity
of saying much. Her (<font color='blue'><b>Darcy</b></font>) own thoughts were employing her (<font color='blue'><b>Darcy</b></font>). She (<font color='blue'><b>Darcy</b></font>) expected every
moment that some of the gentlemen would enter the room. She (<font color='blue'><b>Darcy</b></font>) wished, she (<font color='blue'><b>Darcy</b></font>)
feared that the master of the house might be amongst them; and whether
she (<font color='blue'><b>Darcy</b></font>) wished or feared it most, she (<font color='blue'><b>Darcy</b></font>) could scarcely determine. After
sitting in this manner a quarter of an hour without hearing Miss
Bingley's voice, Elizabeth was roused by receiving from her (<font color='blue'><b>Elizabeth</b></font>) a cold
inquiry after the health of her (<font color='blue'><b>Elizabeth</b></font>) family. She (<font color='blue'><b>Elizabeth</b></font>) answered with equal
indifference and brevity, and the other said no more.

<p/>The next variation which their visit afforded was produced by the
entrance of servants with cold meat, cake, and a variety of all the
finest fruits in season; but this did not take place till after many
a significant look and smile from Mrs. Annesley to Miss Darcy had been
given, to remind her (<font color='blue'><b>Darcy</b></font>) of her (<font color='blue'><b>Darcy</b></font>) post. There was now employment for the whole
party--for though they could not all talk, they could all eat; and the
beautiful pyramids of grapes, nectarines, and peaches soon collected
them round the table.

<p/>While thus engaged, Elizabeth had a fair opportunity of deciding whether
she (<font color='blue'><b>Elizabeth</b></font>) most feared or wished for the appearance of Mr. Darcy, by the
feelings which prevailed on his (<font color='blue'><b>Darcy</b></font>) entering the room; and then, though but
a moment before she (<font color='blue'><b>Elizabeth</b></font>) had believed her (<font color='blue'><b>Elizabeth</b></font>) wishes to predominate, she (<font color='blue'><b>Elizabeth</b></font>) began to
regret that he (<font color='blue'><b>Darcy</b></font>) came.

<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Darcy</b></font>) had been some time with Mr. Gardiner, who, with two or three other
gentlemen from the house, was engaged by the river, and had left him (<font color='blue'><b>Gardiner</b></font>)
only on learning that the ladies of the family intended a visit to
Georgiana that morning. No sooner did he (<font color='blue'><b>Gardiner</b></font>) appear than Elizabeth wisely
resolved to be perfectly easy and unembarrassed; a resolution the more
necessary to be made, but perhaps not the more easily kept, because she (<font color='blue'><b>Elizabeth</b></font>)
saw that the suspicions of the whole party were awakened against them,
and that there was scarcely an eye which did not watch his (<font color='blue'><b>Gardiner</b></font>) behaviour
when he (<font color='blue'><b>Gardiner</b></font>) first came into the room. In no countenance was attentive
curiosity so strongly marked as in Miss Bingley's, in spite of the
smiles which overspread her (<font color='blue'><b>Bingley</b></font>) face whenever she (<font color='blue'><b>Bingley</b></font>) spoke to one of its
objects; for jealousy had not yet made her (<font color='blue'><b>Bingley</b></font>) desperate, and her (<font color='blue'><b>Bingley</b></font>) attentions
to Mr. Darcy were by no means over. Miss Darcy, on her (<font color='blue'><b>Darcy</b></font>) brother's
entrance, exerted herself much more to talk, and Elizabeth saw that he (<font color='blue'><b>Darcy</b></font>)
was anxious for his (<font color='blue'><b>Darcy</b></font>) sister and herself to get acquainted, and forwarded
as much as possible, every attempt at conversation on either side. Miss
Bingley saw all this likewise; and, in the imprudence of anger, took the
first opportunity of saying, with sneering civility:

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Pray, Miss Eliza, are not the --shire Militia removed from Meryton?
They must be a great loss to _your_ family.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Miss Bingley</b></font>)</div><p/>In Darcy's presence she (<font color='blue'><b>Bingley</b></font>) dared not mention Wickham's name; but Elizabeth
instantly comprehended that he (<font color='blue'><b>Wickham</b></font>) was uppermost in her (<font color='blue'><b>Elizabeth</b></font>) thoughts; and the
various recollections connected with him (<font color='blue'><b>Wickham</b></font>) gave her (<font color='blue'><b>Elizabeth</b></font>) a moment's distress;
but exerting herself vigorously to repel the ill-natured attack, she (<font color='blue'><b>Elizabeth</b></font>)
presently answered the question in a tolerably detached tone. While
she (<font color='blue'><b>Elizabeth</b></font>) spoke, an involuntary glance showed her (<font color='blue'><b>Elizabeth</b></font>) Darcy, with a heightened
complexion, earnestly looking at her (<font color='blue'><b>Elizabeth</b></font>), and his (<font color='blue'><b>Darcy</b></font>) sister overcome with
confusion, and unable to lift up her (<font color='blue'><b>sister</b></font>) eyes. Had Miss Bingley known what
pain she (<font color='blue'><b>Bingley</b></font>) was then giving her (<font color='blue'><b>Bingley</b></font>) beloved friend, she (<font color='blue'><b>Bingley</b></font>) undoubtedly would
have refrained from the hint; but she (<font color='blue'><b>Bingley</b></font>) had merely intended to discompose
Elizabeth by bringing forward the idea of a man to whom she (<font color='blue'><b>Elizabeth</b></font>) believed
her (<font color='blue'><b>Elizabeth</b></font>) partial, to make her (<font color='blue'><b>Elizabeth</b></font>) betray a sensibility which might injure her (<font color='blue'><b>Elizabeth</b></font>) in
Darcy's opinion, and, perhaps, to remind the latter of all the follies
and absurdities by which some part of her (<font color='blue'><b>Elizabeth</b></font>) family were connected
with that corps. Not a syllable had ever reached her (<font color='blue'><b>Elizabeth</b></font>) of Miss Darcy's
meditated elopement. To no creature had it been revealed, where secrecy
was possible, except to Elizabeth; and from all Bingley's connections
her (<font color='blue'><b>Elizabeth</b></font>) brother was particularly anxious to conceal it, from the very
wish which Elizabeth had long ago attributed to him (<font color='blue'><b>brother</b></font>), of their becoming
hereafter her (<font color='blue'><b>Elizabeth</b></font>) own. He (<font color='blue'><b>brother</b></font>) had certainly formed such a plan, and without
meaning that it should affect his (<font color='blue'><b>brother</b></font>) endeavour to separate him (<font color='blue'><b>brother</b></font>) from Miss
Bennet, it is probable that it might add something to his (<font color='blue'><b>brother</b></font>) lively concern
for the welfare of his (<font color='blue'><b>brother</b></font>) friend.

<p/>Elizabeth's collected behaviour, however, soon quieted his (<font color='blue'><b>brother</b></font>) emotion; and
as Miss Bingley, vexed and disappointed, dared not approach nearer to
Wickham, Georgiana also recovered in time, though not enough to be able
to speak any more. Her (<font color='blue'><b>Georgiana</b></font>) brother, whose eye she (<font color='blue'><b>Georgiana</b></font>) feared to meet, scarcely
recollected her (<font color='blue'><b>Georgiana</b></font>) interest in the affair, and the very circumstance which
had been designed to turn his (<font color='blue'><b>brother</b></font>) thoughts from Elizabeth seemed to have
fixed them on her (<font color='blue'><b>Elizabeth</b></font>) more and more cheerfully.

<p/>Their visit did not continue long after the question and answer above
mentioned; and while Mr. Darcy was attending them to their carriage Miss
Bingley was venting her (<font color='blue'><b>Bingley</b></font>) feelings in criticisms on Elizabeth's person,
behaviour, and dress. But Georgiana would not join her (<font color='blue'><b>Georgiana</b></font>). Her (<font color='blue'><b>Georgiana</b></font>) brother's
recommendation was enough to ensure her (<font color='blue'><b>Georgiana</b></font>) favour; his (<font color='blue'><b>brother</b></font>) judgement could not
err. And he (<font color='blue'><b>brother</b></font>) had spoken in such terms of Elizabeth as to leave Georgiana
without the power of finding her (<font color='blue'><b>Elizabeth</b></font>) otherwise than lovely and amiable. When
Darcy returned to the saloon, Miss Bingley could not help repeating to
him (<font color='blue'><b>Darcy</b></font>) some part of what she (<font color='blue'><b>Bingley</b></font>) had been saying to his (<font color='blue'><b>Darcy</b></font>) sister.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``How very ill Miss Eliza Bennet looks this morning, Mr. Darcy,''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Bingley</b></font>)
cried; <div class="bookquote">``I never in my life saw anyone so much altered as she (<font color='blue'><b>Bennet</b></font>) is since
the winter. She (<font color='blue'><b>Bennet</b></font>) is grown so brown and coarse! Louisa and I were agreeing
that we should not have known her (<font color='blue'><b>Louisa</b></font>) again.''

 (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div><p/>However little Mr. Darcy might have liked such an address, he (<font color='blue'><b>Darcy</b></font>) contented
himself with coolly replying that he (<font color='blue'><b>Darcy</b></font>) perceived no other alteration than
her (<font color='blue'><b>Bingley</b></font>) being rather tanned, no miraculous consequence of travelling in the
summer.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``For my own part,''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Bingley</b></font>) rejoined, <div class="bookquote">``I must confess that I never could
see any beauty in her (<font color='blue'><b>Louisa</b></font>). Her (<font color='blue'><b>Louisa</b></font>) face is too thin; her (<font color='blue'><b>Louisa</b></font>) complexion has no
brilliancy; and her (<font color='blue'><b>Louisa</b></font>) features are not at all handsome. Her (<font color='blue'><b>Louisa</b></font>) nose
wants character--there is nothing marked in its lines. Her (<font color='blue'><b>Louisa</b></font>) teeth are
tolerable, but not out of the common way; and as for her (<font color='blue'><b>Louisa</b></font>) eyes,
which have sometimes been called so fine, I could never see anything
extraordinary in them. They have a sharp, shrewish look, which I do
not like at all; and in her (<font color='blue'><b>Louisa</b></font>) air altogether there is a self-sufficiency
without fashion, which is intolerable.''

 (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div><p/>Persuaded as Miss Bingley was that Darcy admired Elizabeth, this was not
the best method of recommending herself; but angry people are not always
wise; and in seeing him (<font color='blue'><b>Darcy</b></font>) at last look somewhat nettled, she (<font color='blue'><b>Elizabeth</b></font>) had all the
success she (<font color='blue'><b>Elizabeth</b></font>) expected. He (<font color='blue'><b>Darcy</b></font>) was resolutely silent, however, and, from a
determination of making him (<font color='blue'><b>Darcy</b></font>) speak, she (<font color='blue'><b>Elizabeth</b></font>) continued:

<p/><div class="bookquote">``I remember, when we first knew her (<font color='blue'><b>Louisa</b></font>) in Hertfordshire, how amazed we all
were to find that she (<font color='blue'><b>Louisa</b></font>) was a reputed beauty; and I particularly recollect
your saying one night, after they had been dining at Netherfield, '_She (<font color='blue'><b>Louisa</b></font>)_
a beauty!--I should as soon call her (<font color='blue'><b>Louisa</b></font>) mother a wit.''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>But afterwards she (<font color='blue'><b>Elizabeth</b></font>)
seemed to improve on you, and I believe you thought her (<font color='blue'><b>Elizabeth</b></font>) rather pretty at
one time.''

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Yes,''  (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Darcy/Darcy</b></font>)</div>replied Darcy, who could contain himself no longer, <div class="bookquote">``but _that_
was only when I first saw her (<font color='blue'><b>Louisa</b></font>), for it is many months since I have
considered her (<font color='blue'><b>Louisa</b></font>) as one of the handsomest women of my acquaintance.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Darcy/Darcy</b></font>)</div><p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Darcy</b></font>) then went away, and Miss Bingley was left to all the satisfaction of
having forced him (<font color='blue'><b>Darcy</b></font>) to say what gave no one any pain but herself.

<p/>Mrs. Gardiner and Elizabeth talked of all that had occurred during their
visit, as they returned, except what had particularly interested them
both. The look and behaviour of everybody they had seen were discussed,
except of the person who had mostly engaged their attention. They talked
of his (<font color='blue'><b>Darcy</b></font>) sister, his (<font color='blue'><b>Darcy</b></font>) friends, his (<font color='blue'><b>Darcy</b></font>) house, his (<font color='blue'><b>Darcy</b></font>) fruit--of everything but
himself; yet Elizabeth was longing to know what Mrs. Gardiner thought of
him (<font color='blue'><b>Darcy</b></font>), and Mrs. Gardiner would have been highly gratified by her (<font color='blue'><b>Gardiner</b></font>) niece's
beginning the subject.



<p/>Chapter 46


<p/>Elizabeth had been a good deal disappointed in not finding a letter from
Jane on their first arrival at Lambton; and this disappointment had been
renewed on each of the mornings that had now been spent there; but
on the third her (<font color='blue'><b>Jane</b></font>) repining was over, and her (<font color='blue'><b>Jane</b></font>) sister justified, by the
receipt of two letters from her (<font color='blue'><b>Jane</b></font>) at once, on one of which was marked that
it had been missent elsewhere. Elizabeth was not surprised at it, as
Jane had written the direction remarkably ill.

<p/>They had just been preparing to walk as the letters came in; and
her (<font color='blue'><b>Elizabeth</b></font>) uncle and aunt, leaving her (<font color='blue'><b>Elizabeth</b></font>) to enjoy them in quiet, set off by
themselves. The one missent must first be attended to; it had been
written five days ago. The beginning contained an account of all their
little parties and engagements, with such news as the country afforded;
but the latter half, which was dated a day later, and written in evident
agitation, gave more important intelligence. It was to this effect:

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Since writing the above, dearest Lizzy, something has occurred of a
most unexpected and serious nature; but I am afraid of alarming you--be
assured that we are all well. What I have to say relates to poor Lydia.
An express came at twelve last night, just as we were all gone to bed,
from Colonel Forster, to inform us that she (<font color='blue'><b>Forster</b></font>) was gone off to Scotland
with one of his (<font color='blue'><b>Colonel</b></font>) officers; to own the truth, with Wickham! Imagine our
surprise. To Kitty, however, it does not seem so wholly unexpected. I am
very, very sorry. So imprudent a match on both sides! But I am willing
to hope the best, and that his (<font color='blue'><b>Wickham</b></font>) character has been misunderstood.
Thoughtless and indiscreet I can easily believe him (<font color='blue'><b>Wickham</b></font>), but this step
-LRB-and let us rejoice over it-RRB- marks nothing bad at heart. His (<font color='blue'><b>Wickham</b></font>) choice is
disinterested at least, for he (<font color='blue'><b>Wickham</b></font>) must know my father can give her (<font color='blue'><b>Kitty</b></font>) nothing.
Our poor mother is sadly grieved. My father bears it better. How
thankful am I that we never let them know what has been said against
him (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>); we must forget it ourselves. They were off Saturday night about
twelve, as is conjectured, but were not missed till yesterday morning at
eight. The express was sent off directly. My dear Lizzy, they must have
passed within ten miles of us. Colonel Forster gives us reason to expect
him (<font color='blue'><b>Colonel</b></font>) here soon. Lydia left a few lines for his (<font color='blue'><b>Colonel</b></font>) wife, informing her (<font color='blue'><b>Lydia</b></font>) of
their intention. I must conclude, for I cannot be long from my poor
mother. I am afraid you will not be able to make it out, but I hardly
know what I have written.''

 (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div><p/>Without allowing herself time for consideration, and scarcely knowing
what she (<font color='blue'><b>Elizabeth</b></font>) felt, Elizabeth on finishing this letter instantly seized the
other, and opening it with the utmost impatience, read as follows: it
had been written a day later than the conclusion of the first.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``By this time, my dearest sister, you have received my hurried letter; I
wish this may be more intelligible, but though not confined for time, my
head is so bewildered that I cannot answer for being coherent. Dearest
Lizzy, I hardly know what I would write, but I have bad news for you,
and it cannot be delayed. Imprudent as the marriage between Mr. Wickham
and our poor Lydia would be, we are now anxious to be assured it has
taken place, for there is but too much reason to fear they are not gone
to Scotland. Colonel Forster came yesterday, having left Brighton the
day before, not many hours after the express. Though Lydia's short
letter to Mrs. F. gave them to understand that they were going to Gretna
Green, something was dropped by Denny expressing his (<font color='blue'><b>Denny</b></font>) belief that W.
never intended to go there, or to marry Lydia at all, which was
repeated to Colonel F., who, instantly taking the alarm, set off from B.
intending to trace their route. He (<font color='blue'><b>Colonel</b></font>) did trace them easily to Clapham,
but no further; for on entering that place, they removed into a hackney
coach, and dismissed the chaise that brought them from Epsom. All that
is known after this is, that they were seen to continue the London road.
I know not what to think. After making every possible inquiry on that
side London, Colonel F. came on into Hertfordshire, anxiously renewing
them at all the turnpikes, and at the inns in Barnet and Hatfield, but
without any success--no such people had been seen to pass through. With
the kindest concern he (<font color='blue'><b>Hatfield</b></font>) came on to Longbourn, and broke his (<font color='blue'><b>Hatfield</b></font>) apprehensions
to us in a manner most creditable to his (<font color='blue'><b>Hatfield</b></font>) heart. I am sincerely grieved
for him (<font color='blue'><b>Hatfield</b></font>) and Mrs. F., but no one can throw any blame on them. Our
distress, my dear Lizzy, is very great. My father and mother believe the
worst, but I cannot think so ill of him (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>). Many circumstances might make
it more eligible for them to be married privately in town than to pursue
their first plan; and even if _he (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>)_ could form such a design against a
young woman of Lydia's connections, which is not likely, can I suppose
her (<font color='blue'><b>Lydia</b></font>) so lost to everything? Impossible! I grieve to find, however, that
Colonel F. is not disposed to depend upon their marriage; he (<font color='blue'><b>Colonel</b></font>) shook his (<font color='blue'><b>Colonel</b></font>)
head when I expressed my hopes, and said he (<font color='blue'><b>Colonel</b></font>) feared W. was not a man to
be trusted. My poor mother is really ill, and keeps her (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) room. Could she (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>)
exert herself, it would be better; but this is not to be expected. And
as to my father, I never in my life saw him (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) so affected. Poor Kitty has
anger for having concealed their attachment; but as it was a matter of
confidence, one cannot wonder. I am truly glad, dearest Lizzy, that you
have been spared something of these distressing scenes; but now, as the
first shock is over, shall I own that I long for your return? I am not
so selfish, however, as to press for it, if inconvenient. Adieu! I
take up my pen again to do what I have just told you I would not; but
circumstances are such that I cannot help earnestly begging you all to
come here as soon as possible. I know my dear uncle and aunt so well,
that I am not afraid of requesting it, though I have still something
more to ask of the former. My father is going to London with Colonel
Forster instantly, to try to discover her (<font color='blue'><b>Forster</b></font>). What he (<font color='blue'><b>Colonel</b></font>) means to do I am sure
I know not; but his (<font color='blue'><b>Colonel</b></font>) excessive distress will not allow him (<font color='blue'><b>Colonel</b></font>) to pursue any
measure in the best and safest way, and Colonel Forster is obliged to
be at Brighton again to-morrow evening. In such an exigence, my
uncle's advice and assistance would be everything in the world; he (<font color='blue'><b>uncle</b></font>) will
immediately comprehend what I must feel, and I rely upon his (<font color='blue'><b>uncle</b></font>) goodness.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Oh! where, where is my uncle?''  (<font color='red'><b>Elizabeth/Miss Bennet/Miss Elizabeth</b></font>)</div>cried Elizabeth, darting from her (<font color='blue'><b>Elizabeth</b></font>) seat
as she (<font color='blue'><b>Elizabeth</b></font>) finished the letter, in eagerness to follow him (<font color='blue'><b>it</b></font>), without losing
a moment of the time so precious; but as she (<font color='blue'><b>Elizabeth</b></font>) reached the door it was
opened by a servant, and Mr. Darcy appeared. Her (<font color='blue'><b>Elizabeth</b></font>) pale face and impetuous
manner made him (<font color='blue'><b>Darcy</b></font>) start, and before he (<font color='blue'><b>Darcy</b></font>) could recover himself to speak,
she (<font color='blue'><b>Elizabeth</b></font>), in whose mind every idea was superseded by Lydia's situation,
hastily exclaimed, <div class="bookquote">``I beg your pardon, but I must leave you. I must find
Mr. Gardiner this moment, on business that cannot be delayed; I have not
an instant to lose.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Lydia/Miss Lydia/Miss Lydia Bennet</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Good God! what is the matter?''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>cried he (<font color='blue'><b>Darcy</b></font>), with more feeling than
politeness; then recollecting himself, <div class="bookquote">``I will not detain you a minute;
but let me, or let the servant go after Mr. and Mrs. Gardiner. You are
not well enough; you cannot go yourself.''

 (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div><p/>Elizabeth hesitated, but her (<font color='blue'><b>Elizabeth</b></font>) knees trembled under her (<font color='blue'><b>Elizabeth</b></font>) and she (<font color='blue'><b>Elizabeth</b></font>) felt how
little would be gained by her (<font color='blue'><b>Elizabeth</b></font>) attempting to pursue them. Calling back
the servant, therefore, she (<font color='blue'><b>Elizabeth</b></font>) commissioned him (<font color='blue'><b>servant</b></font>), though in so breathless
an accent as made her (<font color='blue'><b>Elizabeth</b></font>) almost unintelligible, to fetch his (<font color='blue'><b>servant</b></font>) master and
mistress home instantly.

<p/>On his (<font color='blue'><b>servant</b></font>) quitting the room she (<font color='blue'><b>Elizabeth</b></font>) sat down, unable to support herself, and
looking so miserably ill, that it was impossible for Darcy to leave her (<font color='blue'><b>Elizabeth</b></font>),
or to refrain from saying, in a tone of gentleness and commiseration,
<div class="bookquote">``Let me call your maid. Is there nothing you could take to give you
present relief? A glass of wine; shall I get you one? You are very ill.''

 (<font color='red'><b>her</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``No, I thank you,''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Elizabeth</b></font>) replied, endeavouring to recover herself. <div class="bookquote">``There
is nothing the matter with me. I am quite well; I am only distressed by
some dreadful news which I have just received from Longbourn.''

 (<font color='red'><b>She</b></font>)</div><p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>Elizabeth</b></font>) burst into tears as she (<font color='blue'><b>Elizabeth</b></font>) alluded to it, and for a few minutes could
not speak another word. Darcy, in wretched suspense, could only say
something indistinctly of his (<font color='blue'><b>Darcy</b></font>) concern, and observe her (<font color='blue'><b>Elizabeth</b></font>) in compassionate
silence. At length she (<font color='blue'><b>Elizabeth</b></font>) spoke again. <div class="bookquote">``I have just had a letter from Jane,
with such dreadful news. It cannot be concealed from anyone. My younger
sister has left all her (<font color='blue'><b>sister</b></font>) friends--has eloped; has thrown herself into
the power of--of Mr. Wickham. They are gone off together from Brighton.
_You_ know him (<font color='blue'><b>Wickham</b></font>) too well to doubt the rest. She (<font color='blue'><b>sister</b></font>) has no money, no
connections, nothing that can tempt him (<font color='blue'><b>Wickham</b></font>) to--she (<font color='blue'><b>sister</b></font>) is lost for ever.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Darcy/Darcy</b></font>)</div><p/>Darcy was fixed in astonishment. <div class="bookquote">``When I consider,''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Elizabeth</b></font>) added in a yet
more agitated voice, <div class="bookquote">``that I might have prevented it! I, who knew what
he (<font color='blue'><b>Wickham</b></font>) was. Had I but explained some part of it only--some part of what I
learnt, to my own family! Had his (<font color='blue'><b>Wickham</b></font>) character been known, this could not
have happened. But it is all--all too late now.''

 (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I am grieved indeed,''  (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Darcy/Darcy</b></font>)</div>cried Darcy; <div class="bookquote">``grieved--shocked. But is it
certain--absolutely certain?''

 (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Darcy/Darcy</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Oh, yes! They left Brighton together on Sunday night, and were traced
almost to London, but not beyond; they are certainly not gone to
Scotland.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``And what has been done, what has been attempted, to recover her (<font color='blue'><b>it</b></font>)?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``My father is gone to London, and Jane has written to beg my uncle's
immediate assistance; and we shall be off, I hope, in half-an-hour. But
nothing can be done--I know very well that nothing can be done. How is
such a man to be worked on? How are they even to be discovered? I have
not the smallest hope. It is every way horrible!''

 (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Darcy/Darcy</b></font>)</div><p/>Darcy shook his (<font color='blue'><b>Darcy</b></font>) head in silent acquiescence.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``When _my_ eyes were opened to his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) real character--Oh! had I known what
I ought, what I dared to do! But I knew not--I was afraid of doing too
much. Wretched, wretched mistake!''

 (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Darcy/Darcy</b></font>)</div><p/>Darcy made no answer. He (<font color='blue'><b>Darcy</b></font>) seemed scarcely to hear her (<font color='blue'><b>Elizabeth</b></font>), and was walking
up and down the room in earnest meditation, his (<font color='blue'><b>Darcy</b></font>) brow contracted, his (<font color='blue'><b>Darcy</b></font>) air
gloomy. Elizabeth soon observed, and instantly understood it. Her (<font color='blue'><b>Elizabeth</b></font>)
power was sinking; everything _must_ sink under such a proof of family
weakness, such an assurance of the deepest disgrace. She (<font color='blue'><b>Elizabeth</b></font>) could neither
wonder nor condemn, but the belief of his (<font color='blue'><b>Darcy</b></font>) self-conquest brought nothing
consolatory to her (<font color='blue'><b>Elizabeth</b></font>) bosom, afforded no palliation of her (<font color='blue'><b>Elizabeth</b></font>) distress. It
was, on the contrary, exactly calculated to make her (<font color='blue'><b>Elizabeth</b></font>) understand her (<font color='blue'><b>Elizabeth</b></font>) own
wishes; and never had she (<font color='blue'><b>Elizabeth</b></font>) so honestly felt that she (<font color='blue'><b>Elizabeth</b></font>) could have loved
him (<font color='blue'><b>Darcy</b></font>), as now, when all love must be vain.

<p/>But self, though it would intrude, could not engross her (<font color='blue'><b>Elizabeth</b></font>). Lydia--the
humiliation, the misery she (<font color='blue'><b>Lydia</b></font>) was bringing on them all, soon swallowed
up every private care; and covering her (<font color='blue'><b>Lydia</b></font>) face with her (<font color='blue'><b>Lydia</b></font>) handkerchief,
Elizabeth was soon lost to everything else; and, after a pause of
several minutes, was only recalled to a sense of her (<font color='blue'><b>Elizabeth</b></font>) situation by
the voice of her (<font color='blue'><b>Elizabeth</b></font>) companion, who, in a manner which, though it spoke
compassion, spoke likewise restraint, said, <div class="bookquote">``I am afraid you have been
long desiring my absence, nor have I anything to plead in excuse of my
stay, but real, though unavailing concern. Would to Heaven that anything
could be either said or done on my part that might offer consolation to
such distress! But I will not torment you with vain wishes, which may
seem purposely to ask for your thanks. This unfortunate affair will, I
fear, prevent my sister's having the pleasure of seeing you at Pemberley
to-day.''

 (<font color='red'><b>companion</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Oh, yes. Be so kind as to apologise for us to Miss Darcy. Say that
urgent business calls us home immediately. Conceal the unhappy truth as
long as it is possible, I know it cannot be long.''

 (<font color='red'><b>He</b></font>)</div><p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>companion</b></font>) readily assured her (<font color='blue'><b>Elizabeth</b></font>) of his (<font color='blue'><b>companion</b></font>) secrecy; again expressed his (<font color='blue'><b>companion</b></font>) sorrow for
her (<font color='blue'><b>Elizabeth</b></font>) distress, wished it a happier conclusion than there was at present
reason to hope, and leaving his (<font color='blue'><b>companion</b></font>) compliments for her (<font color='blue'><b>Elizabeth</b></font>) relations, with only
one serious, parting look, went away.

<p/>As he (<font color='blue'><b>companion</b></font>) quitted the room, Elizabeth felt how improbable it was that they
should ever see each other again on such terms of cordiality as
had marked their several meetings in Derbyshire; and as she (<font color='blue'><b>Elizabeth</b></font>) threw a
retrospective glance over the whole of their acquaintance, so full
of contradictions and varieties, sighed at the perverseness of those
feelings which would now have promoted its continuance, and would
formerly have rejoiced in its termination.

<p/>If gratitude and esteem are good foundations of affection, Elizabeth's
change of sentiment will be neither improbable nor faulty. But if
otherwise--if regard springing from such sources is unreasonable or
unnatural, in comparison of what is so often described as arising on
a first interview with its object, and even before two words have been
exchanged, nothing can be said in her (<font color='blue'><b>Elizabeth</b></font>) defence, except that she (<font color='blue'><b>Elizabeth</b></font>) had given
somewhat of a trial to the latter method in her (<font color='blue'><b>Elizabeth</b></font>) partiality for Wickham,
and that its ill success might, perhaps, authorise her (<font color='blue'><b>Elizabeth</b></font>) to seek the other
less interesting mode of attachment. Be that as it may, she (<font color='blue'><b>Elizabeth</b></font>) saw him (<font color='blue'><b>Wickham</b></font>)
go with regret; and in this early example of what Lydia's infamy must
produce, found additional anguish as she (<font color='blue'><b>Lydia</b></font>) reflected on that wretched
business. Never, since reading Jane's second letter, had she (<font color='blue'><b>Jane</b></font>) entertained
a hope of Wickham's meaning to marry her (<font color='blue'><b>Jane</b></font>). No one but Jane, she (<font color='blue'><b>Jane</b></font>) thought,
could flatter herself with such an expectation. Surprise was the least
of her (<font color='blue'><b>Jane</b></font>) feelings on this development. While the contents of the first
letter remained in her (<font color='blue'><b>Jane</b></font>) mind, she (<font color='blue'><b>Jane</b></font>) was all surprise--all astonishment that
Wickham should marry a girl whom it was impossible he (<font color='blue'><b>Wickham</b></font>) could marry
for money; and how Lydia could ever have attached him (<font color='blue'><b>Wickham</b></font>) had appeared
incomprehensible. But now it was all too natural. For such an attachment
as this she (<font color='blue'><b>Lydia</b></font>) might have sufficient charms; and though she (<font color='blue'><b>Lydia</b></font>) did not suppose
Lydia to be deliberately engaging in an elopement without the intention
of marriage, she (<font color='blue'><b>Lydia</b></font>) had no difficulty in believing that neither her (<font color='blue'><b>Lydia</b></font>) virtue
nor her (<font color='blue'><b>Lydia</b></font>) understanding would preserve her (<font color='blue'><b>Lydia</b></font>) from falling an easy prey.

<p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>Lydia</b></font>) had never perceived, while the regiment was in Hertfordshire, that
Lydia had any partiality for him (<font color='blue'><b>Wickham</b></font>); but she (<font color='blue'><b>Lydia</b></font>) was convinced that Lydia
wanted only encouragement to attach herself to anybody. Sometimes one
officer, sometimes another, had been her (<font color='blue'><b>Lydia</b></font>) favourite, as their attentions
raised them in her (<font color='blue'><b>Lydia</b></font>) opinion. Her (<font color='blue'><b>Lydia</b></font>) affections had continually been
fluctuating but never without an object. The mischief of neglect and
mistaken indulgence towards such a girl--oh! how acutely did she (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) now
feel it!

<p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) was wild to be at home--to hear, to see, to be upon the spot to
share with Jane in the cares that must now fall wholly upon her (<font color='blue'><b>Jane</b></font>), in a
family so deranged, a father absent, a mother incapable of exertion, and
requiring constant attendance; and though almost persuaded that nothing
could be done for Lydia, her (<font color='blue'><b>Lydia</b></font>) uncle's interference seemed of the utmost
importance, and till he (<font color='blue'><b>uncle</b></font>) entered the room her (<font color='blue'><b>Lydia</b></font>) impatience was severe. Mr.
and Mrs. Gardiner had hurried back in alarm, supposing by the servant's
account that their niece was taken suddenly ill; but satisfying them
instantly on that head, she (<font color='blue'><b>niece</b></font>) eagerly communicated the cause of their
summons, reading the two letters aloud, and dwelling on the postscript
of the last with trembling energy.--Though Lydia had never been a
favourite with them, Mr. and Mrs. Gardiner could not but be deeply
afflicted. Not Lydia only, but all were concerned in it; and after the
first exclamations of surprise and horror, Mr. Gardiner promised every
assistance in his (<font color='blue'><b>Gardiner</b></font>) power. Elizabeth, though expecting no less, thanked
him (<font color='blue'><b>Gardiner</b></font>) with tears of gratitude; and all three being actuated by one spirit,
everything relating to their journey was speedily settled. They were to
be off as soon as possible. <div class="bookquote">``But what is to be done about Pemberley?''
 (<font color='red'><b>Mrs. Gardiner/Gardiner/GARDINER</b></font>)</div>cried Mrs. Gardiner. <div class="bookquote">``John told us Mr. Darcy was here when you sent for
us; was it so?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Yes; and I told him (<font color='blue'><b>Darcy</b></font>) we should not be able to keep our engagement.
_That_ is all settled.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``What is all settled?''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>repeated the other, as she (<font color='blue'><b>Gardiner</b></font>) ran into her (<font color='blue'><b>Gardiner</b></font>) room to
prepare. <div class="bookquote">``And are they upon such terms as for her (<font color='blue'><b>Darcy</b></font>) to disclose the real
truth? Oh, that I knew how it was!''

 (<font color='red'><b>her</b></font>)</div><p/>But wishes were vain, or at least could only serve to amuse her (<font color='blue'><b>Gardiner</b></font>) in the
hurry and confusion of the following hour. Had Elizabeth been at leisure
to be idle, she (<font color='blue'><b>Elizabeth</b></font>) would have remained certain that all employment was
impossible to one so wretched as herself; but she (<font color='blue'><b>Elizabeth</b></font>) had her (<font color='blue'><b>Elizabeth</b></font>) share of
business as well as her (<font color='blue'><b>Elizabeth</b></font>) aunt, and amongst the rest there were notes to
be written to all their friends at Lambton, with false excuses for their
sudden departure. An hour, however, saw the whole completed; and Mr.
Gardiner meanwhile having settled his (<font color='blue'><b>Gardiner</b></font>) account at the inn, nothing
remained to be done but to go; and Elizabeth, after all the misery of
the morning, found herself, in a shorter space of time than she (<font color='blue'><b>Elizabeth</b></font>) could
have supposed, seated in the carriage, and on the road to Longbourn.



<p/>Chapter 47


<p/><div class="bookquote">``I have been thinking it over again, Elizabeth,''  (<font color='red'><b>uncle</b></font>)</div>said her (<font color='blue'><b>Elizabeth</b></font>) uncle, as they
drove from the town; <div class="bookquote">``and really, upon serious consideration, I am much
more inclined than I was to judge as your eldest sister does on the
matter. It appears to me so very unlikely that any young man should
form such a design against a girl who is by no means unprotected or
friendless, and who was actually staying in his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) colonel's family, that I
am strongly inclined to hope the best. Could he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) expect that her (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) friends
would not step forward? Could he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) expect to be noticed again by the
regiment, after such an affront to Colonel Forster? His (<font color='blue'><b>Colonel</b></font>) temptation is
not adequate to the risk!''

 (<font color='red'><b>uncle</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Do you really think so?''  (<font color='red'><b>Elizabeth/Miss Bennet/Miss Elizabeth</b></font>)</div>cried Elizabeth, brightening up for a moment.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Upon my word,''  (<font color='red'><b>Mrs. Gardiner/Gardiner/GARDINER</b></font>)</div>said Mrs. Gardiner, <div class="bookquote">``I begin to be of your uncle's
opinion. It is really too great a violation of decency, honour, and
interest, for him (<font color='blue'><b>uncle</b></font>) to be guilty of. I cannot think so very ill of
Wickham. Can you yourself, Lizzy, so wholly give him (<font color='blue'><b>Wickham</b></font>) up, as to believe
him (<font color='blue'><b>Wickham</b></font>) capable of it?''

 (<font color='red'><b>Mrs. Gardiner/Gardiner/GARDINER</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Not, perhaps, of neglecting his (<font color='blue'><b>Wickham</b></font>) own interest; but of every other
neglect I can believe him (<font color='blue'><b>Wickham</b></font>) capable. If, indeed, it should be so! But I
dare not hope it. Why should they not go on to Scotland if that had been
the case?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``In the first place,''  (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Gardiner/Gardiner</b></font>)</div>replied Mr. Gardiner, <div class="bookquote">``there is no absolute proof
that they are not gone to Scotland.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Gardiner/Gardiner</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Oh! but their removing from the chaise into a hackney coach is such
a presumption! And, besides, no traces of them were to be found on the
Barnet road.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Well, then--supposing them to be in London. They may be there, though
for the purpose of concealment, for no more exceptional purpose. It is
not likely that money should be very abundant on either side; and it
might strike them that they could be more economically, though less
expeditiously, married in London than in Scotland.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``But why all this secrecy? Why any fear of detection? Why must their
marriage be private? Oh, no, no--this is not likely. His (<font color='blue'><b>it</b></font>) most particular
friend, you see by Jane's account, was persuaded of his (<font color='blue'><b>it</b></font>) never intending
to marry her (<font color='blue'><b>Jane</b></font>). Wickham will never marry a woman without some money. He (<font color='blue'><b>Wickham</b></font>)
cannot afford it. And what claims has Lydia--what attraction has she (<font color='blue'><b>Lydia</b></font>)
beyond youth, health, and good humour that could make him (<font color='blue'><b>Wickham</b></font>), for her (<font color='blue'><b>Lydia</b></font>) sake,
forego every chance of benefiting himself by marrying well? As to what
restraint the apprehensions of disgrace in the corps might throw on a
dishonourable elopement with her (<font color='blue'><b>Lydia</b></font>), I am not able to judge; for I know
nothing of the effects that such a step might produce. But as to your
other objection, I am afraid it will hardly hold good. Lydia has
no brothers to step forward; and he (<font color='blue'><b>judge</b></font>) might imagine, from my father's
behaviour, from his (<font color='blue'><b>judge</b></font>) indolence and the little attention he (<font color='blue'><b>judge</b></font>) has ever
seemed to give to what was going forward in his (<font color='blue'><b>judge</b></font>) family, that _he (<font color='blue'><b>judge</b></font>)_ would
do as little, and think as little about it, as any father could do, in
such a matter.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``But can you think that Lydia is so lost to everything but love of him (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>)
as to consent to live with him (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) on any terms other than marriage?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``It does seem, and it is most shocking indeed,''  (<font color='red'><b>Elizabeth/Miss Bennet/Miss Elizabeth</b></font>)</div>replied Elizabeth, with
tears in her (<font color='blue'><b>Gardiner</b></font>) eyes, <div class="bookquote">``that a sister's sense of decency and virtue in such
a point should admit of doubt. But, really, I know not what to say.
Perhaps I am not doing her (<font color='blue'><b>sister</b></font>) justice. But she (<font color='blue'><b>sister</b></font>) is very young; she (<font color='blue'><b>sister</b></font>) has never
been taught to think on serious subjects; and for the last half-year,
nay, for a twelvemonth--she (<font color='blue'><b>sister</b></font>) has been given up to nothing but amusement
and vanity. She (<font color='blue'><b>sister</b></font>) has been allowed to dispose of her (<font color='blue'><b>sister</b></font>) time in the most idle
and frivolous manner, and to adopt any opinions that came in her (<font color='blue'><b>sister</b></font>) way.
Since the --shire were first quartered in Meryton, nothing but love,
flirtation, and officers have been in her (<font color='blue'><b>sister</b></font>) head. She (<font color='blue'><b>sister</b></font>) has been doing
everything in her (<font color='blue'><b>sister</b></font>) power by thinking and talking on the subject, to give
greater--what shall I call it? susceptibility to her (<font color='blue'><b>sister</b></font>) feelings; which are
naturally lively enough. And we all know that Wickham has every charm of
person and address that can captivate a woman.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Elizabeth/Miss Bennet/Miss Elizabeth</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``But you see that Jane,''  (<font color='red'><b>aunt</b></font>)</div>said her (<font color='blue'><b>Gardiner</b></font>) aunt, <div class="bookquote">``does not think so very ill of
Wickham as to believe him (<font color='blue'><b>Wickham</b></font>) capable of the attempt.''

 (<font color='red'><b>aunt</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Of whom does Jane ever think ill? And who is there, whatever might be
their former conduct, that she (<font color='blue'><b>Jane</b></font>) would think capable of such an attempt,
till it were proved against them? But Jane knows, as well as I do, what
Wickham really is. We both know that he (<font color='blue'><b>Wickham</b></font>) has been profligate in every
sense of the word; that he (<font color='blue'><b>Wickham</b></font>) has neither integrity nor honour; that he (<font color='blue'><b>Wickham</b></font>) is
as false and deceitful as he (<font color='blue'><b>Wickham</b></font>) is insinuating.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``And do you really know all this?''  (<font color='red'><b>Mrs. Gardiner/Gardiner/GARDINER</b></font>)</div>cried Mrs. Gardiner, whose curiosity
as to the mode of her (<font color='blue'><b>Gardiner</b></font>) intelligence was all alive.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``I do indeed,''  (<font color='red'><b>Elizabeth/Miss Bennet/Miss Elizabeth</b></font>)</div>replied Elizabeth, colouring. <div class="bookquote">``I told you, the other day,
of his (<font color='blue'><b>Wickham</b></font>) infamous behaviour to Mr. Darcy; and you yourself, when last at
Longbourn, heard in what manner he (<font color='blue'><b>Wickham</b></font>) spoke of the man who had behaved
with such forbearance and liberality towards him (<font color='blue'><b>Wickham</b></font>). And there are other
circumstances which I am not at liberty--which it is not worth while to
relate; but his (<font color='blue'><b>Wickham</b></font>) lies about the whole Pemberley family are endless. From
what he (<font color='blue'><b>Wickham</b></font>) said of Miss Darcy I was thoroughly prepared to see a proud,
reserved, disagreeable girl. Yet he (<font color='blue'><b>Wickham</b></font>) knew to the contrary himself. He (<font color='blue'><b>Wickham</b></font>)
must know that she (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) was as amiable and unpretending as we have found
her (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>).''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``But does Lydia know nothing of this? can she (<font color='blue'><b>Lydia</b></font>) be ignorant of what you
and Jane seem so well to understand?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Oh, yes!--that, that is the worst of all. Till I was in Kent, and saw
so much both of Mr. Darcy and his (<font color='blue'><b>Darcy</b></font>) relation Colonel Fitzwilliam, I was
ignorant of the truth myself. And when I returned home, the --shire
was to leave Meryton in a week or fortnight's time. As that was the
case, neither Jane, to whom I related the whole, nor I, thought it
necessary to make our knowledge public; for of what use could
it apparently be to any one, that the good opinion which all the
neighbourhood had of him (<font color='blue'><b>Darcy</b></font>) should then be overthrown? And even when it was
settled that Lydia should go with Mrs. Forster, the necessity of opening
her (<font color='blue'><b>Lydia</b></font>) eyes to his (<font color='blue'><b>Darcy</b></font>) character never occurred to me. That _she (<font color='blue'><b>Lydia</b></font>)_ could be
in any danger from the deception never entered my head. That such a
consequence as _this_ could ensue, you may easily believe, was far
enough from my thoughts.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``When they all removed to Brighton, therefore, you had no reason, I
suppose, to believe them fond of each other?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Not the slightest. I can remember no symptom of affection on either
side; and had anything of the kind been perceptible, you must be aware
that ours is not a family on which it could be thrown away. When first
he (<font color='blue'><b>you</b></font>) entered the corps, she (<font color='blue'><b>I</b></font>) was ready enough to admire him (<font color='blue'><b>you</b></font>); but so we all
were. Every girl in or near Meryton was out of her (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) senses about him (<font color='blue'><b>you</b></font>) for
the first two months; but he (<font color='blue'><b>you</b></font>) never distinguished _her (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>)_ by any particular
attention; and, consequently, after a moderate period of extravagant and
wild admiration, her (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) fancy for him (<font color='blue'><b>you</b></font>) gave way, and others of the regiment,
who treated her (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) with more distinction, again became her (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) favourites.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/>* * * * *

<p/>It may be easily believed, that however little of novelty could be added
to their fears, hopes, and conjectures, on this interesting subject, by
its repeated discussion, no other could detain them from it long, during
the whole of the journey. From Elizabeth's thoughts it was never absent.
Fixed there by the keenest of all anguish, self-reproach, she (<font color='blue'><b>Elizabeth</b></font>) could find
no interval of ease or forgetfulness.

<p/>They travelled as expeditiously as possible, and, sleeping one night
on the road, reached Longbourn by dinner time the next day. It was a
comfort to Elizabeth to consider that Jane could not have been wearied
by long expectations.

<p/>The little Gardiners, attracted by the sight of a chaise, were standing
on the steps of the house as they entered the paddock; and, when the
carriage drove up to the door, the joyful surprise that lighted up their
faces, and displayed itself over their whole bodies, in a variety of
capers and frisks, was the first pleasing earnest of their welcome.

<p/>Elizabeth jumped out; and, after giving each of them a hasty kiss,
hurried into the vestibule, where Jane, who came running down from her (<font color='blue'><b>Jane</b></font>)
mother's apartment, immediately met her (<font color='blue'><b>Jane</b></font>).

<p/>Elizabeth, as she (<font color='blue'><b>Elizabeth</b></font>) affectionately embraced her (<font color='blue'><b>Elizabeth</b></font>), whilst tears filled the
eyes of both, lost not a moment in asking whether anything had been
heard of the fugitives.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Not yet,''  (<font color='red'><b>Jane</b></font>)</div>replied Jane. <div class="bookquote">``But now that my dear uncle is come, I hope
everything will be well.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Is my father in town?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Yes, he (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) went on Tuesday, as I wrote you word.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``And have you heard from him (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) often?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``We have heard only twice. He (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) wrote me a few lines on Wednesday to say
that he (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) had arrived in safety, and to give me his (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) directions, which I
particularly begged him (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) to do. He (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) merely added that he (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) should not write
again till he (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) had something of importance to mention.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``And my mother--how is she (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>)? How are you all?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``My mother is tolerably well, I trust; though her (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) spirits are greatly
shaken. She (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) is up stairs and will have great satisfaction in seeing you
all. She (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) does not yet leave her (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) dressing-room. Mary and Kitty, thank
Heaven, are quite well.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``But you--how are you?''  (<font color='red'><b>Elizabeth/Miss Bennet/Miss Elizabeth</b></font>)</div>cried Elizabeth. <div class="bookquote">``You look pale. How much you
must have gone through!''

 (<font color='red'><b>sister</b></font>)</div><p/>Her (<font color='blue'><b>Elizabeth</b></font>) sister, however, assured her (<font color='blue'><b>Elizabeth</b></font>) of her (<font color='blue'><b>Elizabeth</b></font>) being perfectly well; and their
conversation, which had been passing while Mr. and Mrs. Gardiner were
engaged with their children, was now put an end to by the approach
of the whole party. Jane ran to her (<font color='blue'><b>Jane</b></font>) uncle and aunt, and welcomed and
thanked them both, with alternate smiles and tears.

<p/>When they were all in the drawing-room, the questions which Elizabeth
had already asked were of course repeated by the others, and they soon
found that Jane had no intelligence to give. The sanguine hope of
good, however, which the benevolence of her (<font color='blue'><b>Jane</b></font>) heart suggested had not yet
deserted her (<font color='blue'><b>Jane</b></font>); she (<font color='blue'><b>Jane</b></font>) still expected that it would all end well, and that
every morning would bring some letter, either from Lydia or her (<font color='blue'><b>Lydia</b></font>) father,
to explain their proceedings, and, perhaps, announce their marriage.

<p/>Mrs. Bennet, to whose apartment they all repaired, after a few minutes'
conversation together, received them exactly as might be expected; with
tears and lamentations of regret, invectives against the villainous
conduct of Wickham, and complaints of her (<font color='blue'><b>Bennet</b></font>) own sufferings and ill-usage;
blaming everybody but the person to whose ill-judging indulgence the
errors of her (<font color='blue'><b>Bennet</b></font>) daughter must principally be owing.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``If I had been able,''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>said she (<font color='blue'><b>Bennet</b></font>), <div class="bookquote">``to carry my point in going to Brighton,
with all my family, _this_ would not have happened; but poor dear Lydia
had nobody to take care of her (<font color='blue'><b>Lydia</b></font>). Why did the Forsters ever let her (<font color='blue'><b>Lydia</b></font>) go out
of their sight? I am sure there was some great neglect or other on their
side, for she (<font color='blue'><b>Lydia</b></font>) is not the kind of girl to do such a thing if she (<font color='blue'><b>Lydia</b></font>) had been
well looked after. I always thought they were very unfit to have the
charge of her (<font color='blue'><b>Lydia</b></font>); but I was overruled, as I always am. Poor dear child!
And now here's Mr. Bennet gone away, and I know he (<font color='blue'><b>Bennet</b></font>) will fight Wickham,
wherever he (<font color='blue'><b>Bennet</b></font>) meets him (<font color='blue'><b>Bennet</b></font>) and then he (<font color='blue'><b>Bennet</b></font>) will be killed, and what is to become
of us all? The Collinses will turn us out before he (<font color='blue'><b>Bennet</b></font>) is cold in his (<font color='blue'><b>Bennet</b></font>)
grave, and if you are not kind to us, brother, I do not know what we
shall do.''

 (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div><p/>They all exclaimed against such terrific ideas; and Mr. Gardiner, after
general assurances of his (<font color='blue'><b>Gardiner</b></font>) affection for her (<font color='blue'><b>Bennet</b></font>) and all her (<font color='blue'><b>Bennet</b></font>) family, told her (<font color='blue'><b>Bennet</b></font>)
that he (<font color='blue'><b>Gardiner</b></font>) meant to be in London the very next day, and would assist Mr.
Bennet in every endeavour for recovering Lydia.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Do not give way to useless alarm,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>added he (<font color='blue'><b>Bennet</b></font>); <div class="bookquote">``though it is right to be
prepared for the worst, there is no occasion to look on it as certain.
It is not quite a week since they left Brighton. In a few days more we
may gain some news of them; and till we know that they are not married,
and have no design of marrying, do not let us give the matter over as
lost. As soon as I get to town I shall go to my brother, and make
him (<font color='blue'><b>brother</b></font>) come home with me to Gracechurch Street; and then we may consult
together as to what is to be done.''

 (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Oh! my dear brother,''  (<font color='red'><b>Mrs. Bennet</b></font>)</div>replied Mrs. Bennet, <div class="bookquote">``that is exactly what I
could most wish for. And now do, when you get to town, find them out,
wherever they may be; and if they are not married already, _make_ them
marry. And as for wedding clothes, do not let them wait for that, but
tell Lydia she (<font color='blue'><b>Lydia</b></font>) shall have as much money as she (<font color='blue'><b>Lydia</b></font>) chooses to buy them,
after they are married. And, above all, keep Mr. Bennet from fighting.
Tell him (<font color='blue'><b>Bennet</b></font>) what a dreadful state I am in, that I am frighted out of my
wits--and have such tremblings, such flutterings, all over me--such
spasms in my side and pains in my head, and such beatings at heart, that
I can get no rest by night nor by day. And tell my dear Lydia not to
give any directions about her (<font color='blue'><b>Lydia</b></font>) clothes till she (<font color='blue'><b>Lydia</b></font>) has seen me, for she (<font color='blue'><b>Lydia</b></font>) does
not know which are the best warehouses. Oh, brother, how kind you are! I
know you will contrive it all.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Mrs. Bennet</b></font>)</div><p/>But Mr. Gardiner, though he (<font color='blue'><b>Gardiner</b></font>) assured her (<font color='blue'><b>Bennet</b></font>) again of his (<font color='blue'><b>Gardiner</b></font>) earnest endeavours
in the cause, could not avoid recommending moderation to her (<font color='blue'><b>Bennet</b></font>), as well
in her (<font color='blue'><b>Bennet</b></font>) hopes as her (<font color='blue'><b>Bennet</b></font>) fear; and after talking with her (<font color='blue'><b>Bennet</b></font>) in this manner till
dinner was on the table, they all left her (<font color='blue'><b>Bennet</b></font>) to vent all her (<font color='blue'><b>Bennet</b></font>) feelings on
the housekeeper, who attended in the absence of her (<font color='blue'><b>Bennet</b></font>) daughters.

<p/>Though her (<font color='blue'><b>Bennet</b></font>) brother and sister were persuaded that there was no real
occasion for such a seclusion from the family, they did not attempt to
oppose it, for they knew that she (<font color='blue'><b>Bennet</b></font>) had not prudence enough to hold her (<font color='blue'><b>Bennet</b></font>)
tongue before the servants, while they waited at table, and judged it
better that _one_ only of the household, and the one whom they could
most trust should comprehend all her (<font color='blue'><b>Bennet</b></font>) fears and solicitude on the
subject.

<p/>In the dining-room they were soon joined by Mary and Kitty, who had been
too busily engaged in their separate apartments to make their appearance
before. One came from her (<font color='blue'><b>Kitty</b></font>) books, and the other from her (<font color='blue'><b>Kitty</b></font>) toilette. The
faces of both, however, were tolerably calm; and no change was visible
in either, except that the loss of her (<font color='blue'><b>Kitty</b></font>) favourite sister, or the anger
which she (<font color='blue'><b>Kitty</b></font>) had herself incurred in this business, had given more of
fretfulness than usual to the accents of Kitty. As for Mary, she (<font color='blue'><b>Mary</b></font>) was
mistress enough of herself to whisper to Elizabeth, with a countenance
of grave reflection, soon after they were seated at table:

<p/><div class="bookquote">``This is a most unfortunate affair, and will probably be much talked of.
But we must stem the tide of malice, and pour into the wounded bosoms of
each other the balm of sisterly consolation.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Elizabeth/Miss Bennet/Miss Elizabeth</b></font>)</div><p/>Then, perceiving in Elizabeth no inclination of replying, she (<font color='blue'><b>Elizabeth</b></font>) added,
<div class="bookquote">``Unhappy as the event must be for Lydia, we may draw from it this useful
lesson: that loss of virtue in a female is irretrievable; that one
false step involves her (<font color='blue'><b>female</b></font>) in endless ruin; that her (<font color='blue'><b>female</b></font>) reputation is no less
brittle than it is beautiful; and that she (<font color='blue'><b>female</b></font>) cannot be too much guarded in
her (<font color='blue'><b>female</b></font>) behaviour towards the undeserving of the other sex.''

 (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div><p/>Elizabeth lifted up her (<font color='blue'><b>Elizabeth</b></font>) eyes in amazement, but was too much oppressed
to make any reply. Mary, however, continued to console herself with such
kind of moral extractions from the evil before them.

<p/>In the afternoon, the two elder Miss Bennets were able to be for
half-an-hour by themselves; and Elizabeth instantly availed herself of
the opportunity of making any inquiries, which Jane was equally eager to
satisfy. After joining in general lamentations over the dreadful sequel
of this event, which Elizabeth considered as all but certain, and Miss
Bennet could not assert to be wholly impossible, the former continued
the subject, by saying, <div class="bookquote">``But tell me all and everything about it which
I have not already heard. Give me further particulars. What did Colonel
Forster say? Had they no apprehension of anything before the elopement
took place? They must have seen them together for ever.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Elizabeth/Miss Bennet/Miss Elizabeth</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Colonel Forster did own that he (<font color='blue'><b>Colonel</b></font>) had often suspected some partiality,
especially on Lydia's side, but nothing to give him (<font color='blue'><b>Colonel</b></font>) any alarm. I am so
grieved for him (<font color='blue'><b>Colonel</b></font>)! His (<font color='blue'><b>Colonel</b></font>) behaviour was attentive and kind to the utmost. He (<font color='blue'><b>Colonel</b></font>)
_was_ coming to us, in order to assure us of his (<font color='blue'><b>Colonel</b></font>) concern, before he (<font color='blue'><b>Colonel</b></font>) had
any idea of their not being gone to Scotland: when that apprehension
first got abroad, it hastened his (<font color='blue'><b>Colonel</b></font>) journey.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``And was Denny convinced that Wickham would not marry? Did he (<font color='blue'><b>Wickham</b></font>) know of
their intending to go off? Had Colonel Forster seen Denny himself?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Yes; but, when questioned by _him (<font color='blue'><b>Denny</b></font>)_, Denny denied knowing anything of
their plans, and would not give his (<font color='blue'><b>Denny</b></font>) real opinion about it. He (<font color='blue'><b>Denny</b></font>) did not
repeat his (<font color='blue'><b>Denny</b></font>) persuasion of their not marrying--and from _that_, I am
inclined to hope, he (<font color='blue'><b>Denny</b></font>) might have been misunderstood before.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``And till Colonel Forster came himself, not one of you entertained a
doubt, I suppose, of their being really married?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``How was it possible that such an idea should enter our brains? I felt
a little uneasy--a little fearful of my sister's happiness with him (<font color='blue'><b>Colonel</b></font>)
in marriage, because I knew that his (<font color='blue'><b>Colonel</b></font>) conduct had not been always quite
right. My father and mother knew nothing of that; they only felt how
imprudent a match it must be. Kitty then owned, with a very natural
triumph on knowing more than the rest of us, that in Lydia's last letter
she (<font color='blue'><b>Lydia</b></font>) had prepared her (<font color='blue'><b>Lydia</b></font>) for such a step. She (<font color='blue'><b>Lydia</b></font>) had known, it seems, of their
being in love with each other, many weeks.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``But not before they went to Brighton?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``No, I believe not.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``And did Colonel Forster appear to think well of Wickham himself? Does
he (<font color='blue'><b>Wickham</b></font>) know his (<font color='blue'><b>Wickham</b></font>) real character?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I must confess that he (<font color='blue'><b>Wickham</b></font>) did not speak so well of Wickham as he (<font color='blue'><b>Wickham</b></font>) formerly
did. He (<font color='blue'><b>Wickham</b></font>) believed him (<font color='blue'><b>Wickham</b></font>) to be imprudent and extravagant. And since this sad
affair has taken place, it is said that he (<font color='blue'><b>Wickham</b></font>) left Meryton greatly in debt;
but I hope this may be false.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Oh, Jane, had we been less secret, had we told what we knew of him (<font color='blue'><b>Wickham</b></font>),
this could not have happened!''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Perhaps it would have been better,''  (<font color='red'><b>sister</b></font>)</div>replied her (<font color='blue'><b>Bennet</b></font>) sister. <div class="bookquote">``But to expose
the former faults of any person without knowing what their present
feelings were, seemed unjustifiable. We acted with the best intentions.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Could Colonel Forster repeat the particulars of Lydia's note to his (<font color='blue'><b>Colonel</b></font>)
wife?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``He (<font color='blue'><b>Colonel</b></font>) brought it with him (<font color='blue'><b>Colonel</b></font>) for us to see.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Jane</b></font>)</div><p/>Jane then took it from her (<font color='blue'><b>Jane</b></font>) pocket-book, and gave it to Elizabeth. These
were the contents:

<p/>``MY DEAR HARRIET,

<p/>``You will laugh when you know where I am gone, and I cannot help
laughing myself at your surprise to-morrow morning, as soon as I am
missed. I am going to Gretna Green, and if you cannot guess with who,
I shall think you a simpleton, for there is but one man in the world I
love, and he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) is an angel. I should never be happy without him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>), so think
it no harm to be off. You need not send them word at Longbourn of my
going, if you do not like it, for it will make the surprise the greater,
when I write to them and sign my name <div class="bookquote">``Lydia Wickham.''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>What a good joke
it will be! I can hardly write for laughing. Pray make my excuses to
Pratt for not keeping my engagement, and dancing with him (<font color='blue'><b>Pratt</b></font>) to-night.
Tell him (<font color='blue'><b>Pratt</b></font>) I hope he (<font color='blue'><b>Pratt</b></font>) will excuse me when he (<font color='blue'><b>Pratt</b></font>) knows all; and tell him (<font color='blue'><b>Pratt</b></font>) I will
dance with him (<font color='blue'><b>Pratt</b></font>) at the next ball we meet, with great pleasure. I shall
send for my clothes when I get to Longbourn; but I wish you would tell
Sally to mend a great slit in my worked muslin gown before they are
packed up. Good-bye. Give my love to Colonel Forster. I hope you will
drink to our good journey.

<p/>``Your affectionate friend,

finished it. <div class="bookquote">``What a letter is this, to be written at such a moment!
But at least it shows that _she (<font color='blue'><b>Lydia</b></font>)_ was serious on the subject of their
journey. Whatever he (<font color='blue'><b>Wickham</b></font>) might afterwards persuade her (<font color='blue'><b>Lydia</b></font>) to, it was not on her (<font color='blue'><b>Lydia</b></font>)
side a _scheme_ of infamy. My poor father! how he (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) must have felt it!''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I never saw anyone so shocked. He (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) could not speak a word for full ten
minutes. My mother was taken ill immediately, and the whole house in
such confusion!''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Oh! Jane,''  (<font color='red'><b>Elizabeth/Miss Bennet/Miss Elizabeth</b></font>)</div>cried Elizabeth, <div class="bookquote">``was there a servant belonging to it who
did not know the whole story before the end of the day?''

 (<font color='red'><b>Elizabeth/Miss Bennet/Miss Elizabeth</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I do not know. I hope there was. But to be guarded at such a time is
very difficult. My mother was in hysterics, and though I endeavoured to
give her (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) every assistance in my power, I am afraid I did not do so
much as I might have done! But the horror of what might possibly happen
almost took from me my faculties.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Your attendance upon her (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) has been too much for you. You do not look
well. Oh that I had been with you! you have had every care and anxiety
upon yourself alone.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Mary and Kitty have been very kind, and would have shared in every
fatigue, I am sure; but I did not think it right for either of them.
Kitty is slight and delicate; and Mary studies so much, that her (<font color='blue'><b>Mary</b></font>) hours
of repose should not be broken in on. My aunt Phillips came to Longbourn
on Tuesday, after my father went away; and was so good as to stay till
Thursday with me. She (<font color='blue'><b>Phillips</b></font>) was of great use and comfort to us all. And
Lady Lucas has been very kind; she (<font color='blue'><b>Lucas</b></font>) walked here on Wednesday morning to
condole with us, and offered her (<font color='blue'><b>Lucas</b></font>) services, or any of her (<font color='blue'><b>Lucas</b></font>) daughters', if
they should be of use to us.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``She (<font color='blue'><b>Lucas</b></font>) had better have stayed at home,''  (<font color='red'><b>Elizabeth/Miss Bennet/Miss Elizabeth</b></font>)</div>cried Elizabeth; <div class="bookquote">``perhaps she (<font color='blue'><b>Lucas</b></font>)
_meant_ well, but, under such a misfortune as this, one cannot see
too little of one's neighbours. Assistance is impossible; condolence
insufferable. Let them triumph over us at a distance, and be satisfied.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Elizabeth/Miss Bennet/Miss Elizabeth</b></font>)</div><p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>Elizabeth</b></font>) then proceeded to inquire into the measures which her (<font color='blue'><b>Elizabeth</b></font>) father had
intended to pursue, while in town, for the recovery of his (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) daughter.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``He (<font color='blue'><b>Lucas</b></font>) meant I believe,''  (<font color='red'><b>Jane</b></font>)</div>replied Jane, <div class="bookquote">``to go to Epsom, the place where
they last changed horses, see the postilions and try if anything could
be made out from them. His (<font color='blue'><b>Lucas</b></font>) principal object must be to discover the
number of the hackney coach which took them from Clapham. It had come
with a fare from London; and as he (<font color='blue'><b>Clapham</b></font>) thought that the circumstance of a
gentleman and lady's removing from one carriage into another might
be remarked he (<font color='blue'><b>Clapham</b></font>) meant to make inquiries at Clapham. If he (<font color='blue'><b>Clapham</b></font>) could anyhow
discover at what house the coachman had before set down his (<font color='blue'><b>Clapham</b></font>) fare, he (<font color='blue'><b>Clapham</b></font>)
determined to make inquiries there, and hoped it might not be impossible
to find out the stand and number of the coach. I do not know of any
other designs that he (<font color='blue'><b>coach</b></font>) had formed; but he (<font color='blue'><b>coach</b></font>) was in such a hurry to be gone,
and his (<font color='blue'><b>coach</b></font>) spirits so greatly discomposed, that I had difficulty in finding
out even so much as this.''



 (<font color='red'><b>Jane</b></font>)</div><p/>Chapter 48


<p/>The whole party were in hopes of a letter from Mr. Bennet the next
morning, but the post came in without bringing a single line from him (<font color='blue'><b>Bennet</b></font>).
His (<font color='blue'><b>Bennet</b></font>) family knew him (<font color='blue'><b>Bennet</b></font>) to be, on all common occasions, a most negligent and
dilatory correspondent; but at such a time they had hoped for exertion.
They were forced to conclude that he (<font color='blue'><b>correspondent</b></font>) had no pleasing intelligence to
send; but even of _that_ they would have been glad to be certain. Mr.
Gardiner had waited only for the letters before he (<font color='blue'><b>Gardiner</b></font>) set off.

<p/>When he (<font color='blue'><b>Gardiner</b></font>) was gone, they were certain at least of receiving constant
information of what was going on, and their uncle promised, at parting,
to prevail on Mr. Bennet to return to Longbourn, as soon as he (<font color='blue'><b>Bennet</b></font>) could,
to the great consolation of his (<font color='blue'><b>Bennet</b></font>) sister, who considered it as the only
security for her (<font color='blue'><b>sister</b></font>) husband's not being killed in a duel.

<p/>Mrs. Gardiner and the children were to remain in Hertfordshire a few
days longer, as the former thought her (<font color='blue'><b>Gardiner</b></font>) presence might be serviceable
to her (<font color='blue'><b>Gardiner</b></font>) nieces. She (<font color='blue'><b>Gardiner</b></font>) shared in their attendance on Mrs. Bennet, and was a
great comfort to them in their hours of freedom. Their other aunt also
visited them frequently, and always, as she (<font color='blue'><b>aunt</b></font>) said, with the design of
cheering and heartening them up--though, as she (<font color='blue'><b>aunt</b></font>) never came without
reporting some fresh instance of Wickham's extravagance or irregularity,
she (<font color='blue'><b>aunt</b></font>) seldom went away without leaving them more dispirited than she (<font color='blue'><b>aunt</b></font>) found
them.

<p/>All Meryton seemed striving to blacken the man who, but three months
before, had been almost an angel of light. He (<font color='blue'><b>angel</b></font>) was declared to be in debt
to every tradesman in the place, and his (<font color='blue'><b>angel</b></font>) intrigues, all honoured with
the title of seduction, had been extended into every tradesman's family.
Everybody declared that he (<font color='blue'><b>tradesman</b></font>) was the wickedest young man in the world;
and everybody began to find out that they had always distrusted the
appearance of his (<font color='blue'><b>tradesman</b></font>) goodness. Elizabeth, though she (<font color='blue'><b>Elizabeth</b></font>) did not credit above
half of what was said, believed enough to make her (<font color='blue'><b>Elizabeth</b></font>) former assurance of
her (<font color='blue'><b>Elizabeth</b></font>) sister's ruin more certain; and even Jane, who believed still less
of it, became almost hopeless, more especially as the time was now come
when, if they had gone to Scotland, which she (<font color='blue'><b>Jane</b></font>) had never before entirely
despaired of, they must in all probability have gained some news of
them.

<p/>Mr. Gardiner left Longbourn on Sunday; on Tuesday his (<font color='blue'><b>Gardiner</b></font>) wife received a
letter from him (<font color='blue'><b>Gardiner</b></font>); it told them that, on his (<font color='blue'><b>Gardiner</b></font>) arrival, he (<font color='blue'><b>Gardiner</b></font>) had immediately
found out his (<font color='blue'><b>Gardiner</b></font>) brother, and persuaded him (<font color='blue'><b>Gardiner</b></font>) to come to Gracechurch Street;
that Mr. Bennet had been to Epsom and Clapham, before his (<font color='blue'><b>Bennet</b></font>) arrival,
but without gaining any satisfactory information; and that he (<font color='blue'><b>Bennet</b></font>) was now
determined to inquire at all the principal hotels in town, as Mr. Bennet
thought it possible they might have gone to one of them, on their first
coming to London, before they procured lodgings. Mr. Gardiner himself
did not expect any success from this measure, but as his (<font color='blue'><b>Gardiner</b></font>) brother was
eager in it, he (<font color='blue'><b>Gardiner</b></font>) meant to assist him (<font color='blue'><b>Gardiner</b></font>) in pursuing it. He (<font color='blue'><b>Gardiner</b></font>) added that Mr.
Bennet seemed wholly disinclined at present to leave London and promised
to write again very soon. There was also a postscript to this effect:

<p/><div class="bookquote">``I have written to Colonel Forster to desire him (<font color='blue'><b>Colonel</b></font>) to find out, if
possible, from some of the young man's intimates in the regiment,
whether Wickham has any relations or connections who would be likely to
know in what part of town he (<font color='blue'><b>Wickham</b></font>) has now concealed himself. If there were
anyone that one could apply to with a probability of gaining such a
clue as that, it might be of essential consequence. At present we have
nothing to guide us. Colonel Forster will, I dare say, do everything in
his (<font color='blue'><b>Colonel</b></font>) power to satisfy us on this head. But, on second thoughts, perhaps,
Lizzy could tell us what relations he (<font color='blue'><b>Colonel</b></font>) has now living, better than any
other person.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Elizabeth/Miss Bennet/Miss Elizabeth</b></font>)</div><p/>Elizabeth was at no loss to understand from whence this deference to her (<font color='blue'><b>Elizabeth</b></font>)
authority proceeded; but it was not in her (<font color='blue'><b>Elizabeth</b></font>) power to give any information
of so satisfactory a nature as the compliment deserved. She (<font color='blue'><b>Elizabeth</b></font>) had never
heard of his (<font color='blue'><b>Bennet</b></font>) having had any relations, except a father and mother, both
of whom had been dead many years. It was possible, however, that some of
his (<font color='blue'><b>Bennet</b></font>) companions in the --shire might be able to give more information;
and though she (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) was not very sanguine in expecting it, the application
was a something to look forward to.

<p/>Every day at Longbourn was now a day of anxiety; but the most anxious
part of each was when the post was expected. The arrival of letters
was the grand object of every morning's impatience. Through letters,
whatever of good or bad was to be told would be communicated, and every
succeeding day was expected to bring some news of importance.

<p/>But before they heard again from Mr. Gardiner, a letter arrived for
their father, from a different quarter, from Mr. Collins; which, as Jane
had received directions to open all that came for him (<font color='blue'><b>Collins</b></font>) in his (<font color='blue'><b>Collins</b></font>) absence,
she (<font color='blue'><b>Jane</b></font>) accordingly read; and Elizabeth, who knew what curiosities his (<font color='blue'><b>Collins</b></font>)
letters always were, looked over her (<font color='blue'><b>Elizabeth</b></font>), and read it likewise. It was as
follows:

<p/>``MY DEAR SIR,

<p/>``I feel myself called upon, by our relationship, and my situation
in life, to condole with you on the grievous affliction you are now
suffering under, of which we were yesterday informed by a letter from
Hertfordshire. Be assured, my dear sir, that Mrs. Collins and myself
sincerely sympathise with you and all your respectable family, in
your present distress, which must be of the bitterest kind, because
proceeding from a cause which no time can remove. No arguments shall be
wanting on my part that can alleviate so severe a misfortune--or that
may comfort you, under a circumstance that must be of all others the
most afflicting to a parent's mind. The death of your daughter would
have been a blessing in comparison of this. And it is the more to
be lamented, because there is reason to suppose as my dear Charlotte
informs me, that this licentiousness of behaviour in your daughter has
proceeded from a faulty degree of indulgence; though, at the same time,
for the consolation of yourself and Mrs. Bennet, I am inclined to think
that her (<font color='blue'><b>Bennet</b></font>) own disposition must be naturally bad, or she (<font color='blue'><b>Bennet</b></font>) could not be
guilty of such an enormity, at so early an age. Howsoever that may be,
you are grievously to be pitied; in which opinion I am not only joined
by Mrs. Collins, but likewise by Lady Catherine and her (<font color='blue'><b>Catherine</b></font>) daughter, to
whom I have related the affair. They agree with me in apprehending that
this false step in one daughter will be injurious to the fortunes of
all the others; for who, as Lady Catherine herself condescendingly says,
will connect themselves with such a family? And this consideration leads
me moreover to reflect, with augmented satisfaction, on a certain event
of last November; for had it been otherwise, I must have been involved
in all your sorrow and disgrace. Let me then advise you, dear sir, to
console yourself as much as possible, to throw off your unworthy child
from your affection for ever, and leave her (<font color='blue'><b>Catherine</b></font>) to reap the fruits of her (<font color='blue'><b>Catherine</b></font>)
own heinous offense.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``I am, dear sir, etc., etc.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Gardiner/Gardiner</b></font>)</div><p/>Mr. Gardiner did not write again till he (<font color='blue'><b>Gardiner</b></font>) had received an answer from
Colonel Forster; and then he (<font color='blue'><b>Gardiner</b></font>) had nothing of a pleasant nature to send.
It was not known that Wickham had a single relationship with whom he (<font color='blue'><b>Wickham</b></font>)
kept up any connection, and it was certain that he (<font color='blue'><b>Wickham</b></font>) had no near one
living. His (<font color='blue'><b>Wickham</b></font>) former acquaintances had been numerous; but since he (<font color='blue'><b>Wickham</b></font>)
had been in the militia, it did not appear that he (<font color='blue'><b>Wickham</b></font>) was on terms of
particular friendship with any of them. There was no one, therefore,
who could be pointed out as likely to give any news of him (<font color='blue'><b>Wickham</b></font>). And in the
wretched state of his (<font color='blue'><b>Wickham</b></font>) own finances, there was a very powerful motive for
secrecy, in addition to his (<font color='blue'><b>Wickham</b></font>) fear of discovery by Lydia's relations, for
it had just transpired that he (<font color='blue'><b>Wickham</b></font>) had left gaming debts behind him (<font color='blue'><b>Wickham</b></font>) to a
very considerable amount. Colonel Forster believed that more than a
thousand pounds would be necessary to clear his (<font color='blue'><b>Colonel</b></font>) expenses at Brighton.
He (<font color='blue'><b>Colonel</b></font>) owed a good deal in town, but his (<font color='blue'><b>Colonel</b></font>) debts of honour were still more
formidable. Mr. Gardiner did not attempt to conceal these particulars
from the Longbourn family. Jane heard them with horror. <div class="bookquote">``A gamester!''
 (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Jane</b></font>) cried. <div class="bookquote">``This is wholly unexpected. I had not an idea of it.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Gardiner/Gardiner</b></font>)</div><p/>Mr. Gardiner added in his (<font color='blue'><b>Gardiner</b></font>) letter, that they might expect to see their
father at home on the following day, which was Saturday. Rendered
spiritless by the ill-success of all their endeavours, he (<font color='blue'><b>Gardiner</b></font>) had yielded
to his (<font color='blue'><b>Gardiner</b></font>) brother-in-law's entreaty that he (<font color='blue'><b>Gardiner</b></font>) would return to his (<font color='blue'><b>Gardiner</b></font>) family, and
leave it to him (<font color='blue'><b>Gardiner</b></font>) to do whatever occasion might suggest to be advisable
for continuing their pursuit. When Mrs. Bennet was told of this, she (<font color='blue'><b>Bennet</b></font>) did
not express so much satisfaction as her (<font color='blue'><b>Bennet</b></font>) children expected, considering
what her (<font color='blue'><b>Bennet</b></font>) anxiety for his (<font color='blue'><b>Gardiner</b></font>) life had been before.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``What, is he (<font color='blue'><b>Catherine</b></font>) coming home, and without poor Lydia?''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Bennet</b></font>) cried. <div class="bookquote">``Sure he (<font color='blue'><b>Catherine</b></font>)
will not leave London before he (<font color='blue'><b>Catherine</b></font>) has found them. Who is to fight Wickham,
and make him (<font color='blue'><b>Wickham</b></font>) marry her (<font color='blue'><b>Lydia</b></font>), if he (<font color='blue'><b>Wickham</b></font>) comes away?''

 (<font color='red'><b>Mrs. Gardiner/Gardiner/GARDINER</b></font>)</div><p/>As Mrs. Gardiner began to wish to be at home, it was settled that she (<font color='blue'><b>Gardiner</b></font>)
and the children should go to London, at the same time that Mr. Bennet
came from it. The coach, therefore, took them the first stage of their
journey, and brought its master back to Longbourn.

<p/>Mrs. Gardiner went away in all the perplexity about Elizabeth and her (<font color='blue'><b>Gardiner</b></font>)
Derbyshire friend that had attended her (<font color='blue'><b>Gardiner</b></font>) from that part of the world. His (<font color='blue'><b>friend</b></font>)
name had never been voluntarily mentioned before them by her (<font color='blue'><b>Gardiner</b></font>) niece; and
the kind of half-expectation which Mrs. Gardiner had formed, of their
being followed by a letter from him (<font color='blue'><b>friend</b></font>), had ended in nothing. Elizabeth had
received none since her (<font color='blue'><b>Elizabeth</b></font>) return that could come from Pemberley.

<p/>The present unhappy state of the family rendered any other excuse for
the lowness of her (<font color='blue'><b>Elizabeth</b></font>) spirits unnecessary; nothing, therefore, could be
fairly conjectured from _that_, though Elizabeth, who was by this time
tolerably well acquainted with her (<font color='blue'><b>Elizabeth</b></font>) own feelings, was perfectly aware
that, had she (<font color='blue'><b>Elizabeth</b></font>) known nothing of Darcy, she (<font color='blue'><b>Elizabeth</b></font>) could have borne the dread of
Lydia's infamy somewhat better. It would have spared her (<font color='blue'><b>Lydia</b></font>), she (<font color='blue'><b>Lydia</b></font>) thought,
one sleepless night out of two.

<p/>When Mr. Bennet arrived, he (<font color='blue'><b>Bennet</b></font>) had all the appearance of his (<font color='blue'><b>Bennet</b></font>) usual
philosophic composure. He (<font color='blue'><b>Bennet</b></font>) said as little as he (<font color='blue'><b>Bennet</b></font>) had ever been in the
habit of saying; made no mention of the business that had taken him (<font color='blue'><b>Bennet</b></font>)
away, and it was some time before his (<font color='blue'><b>Bennet</b></font>) daughters had courage to speak of
it.

<p/>It was not till the afternoon, when he (<font color='blue'><b>Bennet</b></font>) had joined them at tea, that
Elizabeth ventured to introduce the subject; and then, on her (<font color='blue'><b>Elizabeth</b></font>) briefly
expressing her (<font color='blue'><b>Elizabeth</b></font>) sorrow for what he (<font color='blue'><b>Bennet</b></font>) must have endured, he (<font color='blue'><b>Bennet</b></font>) replied, <div class="bookquote">``Say
nothing of that. Who should suffer but myself? It has been my own doing,
and I ought to feel it.''

 (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``You must not be too severe upon yourself,''  (<font color='red'><b>Elizabeth/Miss Bennet/Miss Elizabeth</b></font>)</div>replied Elizabeth.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``You may well warn me against such an evil. Human nature is so prone
to fall into it! No, Lizzy, let me once in my life feel how much I have
been to blame. I am not afraid of being overpowered by the impression.
It will pass away soon enough.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Do you suppose them to be in London?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Yes; where else can they be so well concealed?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``And Lydia used to want to go to London,''  (<font color='red'><b>Kitty</b></font>)</div>added Kitty.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``She (<font color='blue'><b>Lydia</b></font>) is happy then,''  (<font color='red'><b>father residence</b></font>)</div>said her (<font color='blue'><b>Elizabeth</b></font>) father drily; <div class="bookquote">``and her (<font color='blue'><b>Lydia</b></font>) residence there
will probably be of some duration.''

 (<font color='red'><b>father residence</b></font>)</div><p/>Then after a short silence he (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) continued:

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Lizzy, I bear you no ill-will for being justified in your advice to me
last May, which, considering the event, shows some greatness of mind.''

 (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div><p/>They were interrupted by Miss Bennet, who came to fetch her (<font color='blue'><b>Bennet</b></font>) mother's
tea.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``This is a parade,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) cried, <div class="bookquote">``which does one good; it gives such an
elegance to misfortune! Another day I will do the same; I will sit in my
library, in my nightcap and powdering gown, and give as much trouble as
I can; or, perhaps, I may defer it till Kitty runs away.''

 (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I am not going to run away, papa,''  (<font color='red'><b>Kitty</b></font>)</div>said Kitty fretfully. <div class="bookquote">``If I should
ever go to Brighton, I would behave better than Lydia.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">''_You_ go to Brighton. I would not trust you so near it as Eastbourne
for fifty pounds! No, Kitty, I have at last learnt to be cautious, and
you will feel the effects of it. No officer is ever to enter into
my house again, nor even to pass through the village. Balls will be
absolutely prohibited, unless you stand up with one of your sisters.
And you are never to stir out of doors till you can prove that you have
spent ten minutes of every day in a rational manner.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Kitty</b></font>)</div><p/>Kitty, who took all these threats in a serious light, began to cry.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Well, well,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>said he (<font color='blue'><b>officer</b></font>), <div class="bookquote">``do not make yourself unhappy. If you are a good
girl for the next ten years, I will take you to a review at the end of
them.''



 (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div><p/>Chapter 49


<p/>Two days after Mr. Bennet's return, as Jane and Elizabeth were walking
together in the shrubbery behind the house, they saw the housekeeper
coming towards them, and, concluding that she (<font color='blue'><b>housekeeper</b></font>) came to call them to their
mother, went forward to meet her (<font color='blue'><b>housekeeper</b></font>); but, instead of the expected summons,
when they approached her (<font color='blue'><b>housekeeper</b></font>), she (<font color='blue'><b>housekeeper</b></font>) said to Miss Bennet, <div class="bookquote">``I beg your pardon,
madam, for interrupting you, but I was in hopes you might have got some
good news from town, so I took the liberty of coming to ask.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Elizabeth/Miss Bennet/Miss Elizabeth</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``What do you mean, Hill? We have heard nothing from town.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Dear madam,''  (<font color='red'><b>Hill/Mrs. Hill</b></font>)</div>cried Mrs. Hill, in great astonishment, <div class="bookquote">``don't you know
there is an express come for master from Mr. Gardiner? He (<font color='blue'><b>Gardiner</b></font>) has been here
this half-hour, and master has had a letter.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Hill/Mrs. Hill</b></font>)</div><p/>Away ran the girls, too eager to get in to have time for speech. They
ran through the vestibule into the breakfast-room; from thence to the
library; their father was in neither; and they were on the point of
seeking him (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) up stairs with their mother, when they were met by the
butler, who said:

<p/><div class="bookquote">``If you are looking for my master, ma'am, he (<font color='blue'><b>master</b></font>) is walking towards the
little copse.''

 (<font color='red'><b>the butler</b></font>)</div><p/>Upon this information, they instantly passed through the hall once
more, and ran across the lawn after their father, who was deliberately
pursuing his (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) way towards a small wood on one side of the paddock.

<p/>Jane, who was not so light nor so much in the habit of running as
Elizabeth, soon lagged behind, while her (<font color='blue'><b>Elizabeth</b></font>) sister, panting for breath,
came up with him (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>), and eagerly cried out:

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Oh, papa, what news--what news? Have you heard from my uncle?''

 (<font color='red'><b>him</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Yes I have had a letter from him (<font color='blue'><b>uncle</b></font>) by express.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Well, and what news does it bring--good or bad?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``What is there of good to be expected?''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>said he (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>), taking the letter from
his (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) pocket. <div class="bookquote">``But perhaps you would like to read it.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Elizabeth/Miss Bennet/Miss Elizabeth</b></font>)</div><p/>Elizabeth impatiently caught it from his (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) hand. Jane now came up.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Read it aloud,''  (<font color='red'><b>father</b></font>)</div>said their father, <div class="bookquote">``for I hardly know myself what it is
about.''

 (<font color='red'><b>father</b></font>)</div><p/>``Gracechurch Street, Monday, August 2.

<p/>``MY DEAR BROTHER,

<p/><div class="bookquote">``At last I am able to send you some tidings of my niece, and such as,
upon the whole, I hope it will give you satisfaction. Soon after you
left me on Saturday, I was fortunate enough to find out in what part of
London they were. The particulars I reserve till we meet; it is enough
to know they are discovered. I have seen them both--''

 (<font color='red'><b>Jane</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Then it is as I always hoped,''  (<font color='red'><b>Jane</b></font>)</div>cried Jane; <div class="bookquote">``they are married!''

 (<font color='red'><b>Jane</b></font>)</div><p/>Elizabeth read on:

<p/>``I have seen them both. They are not married, nor can I find there
was any intention of being so; but if you are willing to perform the
engagements which I have ventured to make on your side, I hope it will
not be long before they are. All that is required of you is, to assure
to your daughter, by settlement, her (<font color='blue'><b>daughter</b></font>) equal share of the five thousand
pounds secured among your children after the decease of yourself and
my sister; and, moreover, to enter into an engagement of allowing her (<font color='blue'><b>sister</b></font>),
during your life, one hundred pounds per annum. These are conditions
which, considering everything, I had no hesitation in complying with,
as far as I thought myself privileged, for you. I shall send this by
express, that no time may be lost in bringing me your answer. You
will easily comprehend, from these particulars, that Mr. Wickham's
circumstances are not so hopeless as they are generally believed to be.
The world has been deceived in that respect; and I am happy to say there
will be some little money, even when all his (<font color='blue'><b>Wickham</b></font>) debts are discharged, to
settle on my niece, in addition to her (<font color='blue'><b>niece</b></font>) own fortune. If, as I conclude
will be the case, you send me full powers to act in your name throughout
the whole of this business, I will immediately give directions to
Haggerston for preparing a proper settlement. There will not be the
smallest occasion for your coming to town again; therefore stay quiet at
Longbourn, and depend on my diligence and care. Send back your answer as
fast as you can, and be careful to write explicitly. We have judged it
best that my niece should be married from this house, of which I hope
you will approve. She (<font color='blue'><b>niece</b></font>) comes to us to-day. I shall write again as soon as
anything more is determined on. Yours, etc.,

<p/><div class="bookquote">``EDW. GARDINER.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Is it possible?''  (<font color='red'><b>Elizabeth/Miss Bennet/Miss Elizabeth</b></font>)</div>cried Elizabeth, when she (<font color='blue'><b>Elizabeth</b></font>) had finished. <div class="bookquote">``Can it be
possible that he (<font color='blue'><b>it</b></font>) will marry her (<font color='blue'><b>GARDINER</b></font>)?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Wickham is not so undeserving, then, as we thought him (<font color='blue'><b>Wickham</b></font>),''  (<font color='red'><b>sister</b></font>)</div>said her (<font color='blue'><b>Elizabeth</b></font>)
sister. <div class="bookquote">``My dear father, I congratulate you.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``And have you answered the letter?''  (<font color='red'><b>Elizabeth/Miss Bennet/Miss Elizabeth</b></font>)</div>cried Elizabeth.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``No; but it must be done soon.''

 (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div><p/>Most earnestly did she (<font color='blue'><b>Elizabeth</b></font>) then entreat him (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) to lose no more time before he (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>)
wrote.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Oh! my dear father,''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Elizabeth</b></font>) cried, <div class="bookquote">``come back and write immediately.
Consider how important every moment is in such a case.''

 (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Let me write for you,''  (<font color='red'><b>Jane</b></font>)</div>said Jane, <div class="bookquote">``if you dislike the trouble
yourself.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Jane</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I dislike it very much,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) replied; <div class="bookquote">``but it must be done.''

 (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div><p/>And so saying, he (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) turned back with them, and walked towards the house.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``And may I ask--''  (<font color='red'><b>Elizabeth/Miss Bennet/Miss Elizabeth</b></font>)</div>said Elizabeth; <div class="bookquote">``but the terms, I suppose, must be
complied with.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Elizabeth/Miss Bennet/Miss Elizabeth</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Complied with! I am only ashamed of his (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) asking so little.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``And they _must_ marry! Yet he (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) is _such_ a man!''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Yes, yes, they must marry. There is nothing else to be done. But there
are two things that I want very much to know; one is, how much money
your uncle has laid down to bring it about; and the other, how am I ever
to pay him (<font color='blue'><b>uncle</b></font>).''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Money! My uncle!''  (<font color='red'><b>Jane</b></font>)</div>cried Jane, <div class="bookquote">``what do you mean, sir?''

 (<font color='red'><b>Jane</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I mean, that no man in his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) senses would marry Lydia on so slight a
temptation as one hundred a year during my life, and fifty after I am
gone.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``That is very true,''  (<font color='red'><b>Elizabeth/Miss Bennet/Miss Elizabeth</b></font>)</div>said Elizabeth; <div class="bookquote">``though it had not occurred to me
before. His (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) debts to be discharged, and something still to remain! Oh!
it must be my uncle's doings! Generous, good man, I am afraid he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) has
distressed himself. A small sum could not do all this.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Elizabeth/Miss Bennet/Miss Elizabeth</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``No,''  (<font color='red'><b>father fool</b></font>)</div>said her (<font color='blue'><b>Elizabeth</b></font>) father; <div class="bookquote">``Wickham's a fool if he (<font color='blue'><b>Wickham</b></font>) takes her (<font color='blue'><b>Lydia</b></font>) with a farthing
less than ten thousand pounds. I should be sorry to think so ill of him (<font color='blue'><b>Wickham</b></font>),
in the very beginning of our relationship.''

 (<font color='red'><b>father fool</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Ten thousand pounds! Heaven forbid! How is half such a sum to be
repaid?''

 (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Bennet</b></font>)</div><p/>Mr. Bennet made no answer, and each of them, deep in thought, continued
silent till they reached the house. Their father then went on to the
library to write, and the girls walked into the breakfast-room.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``And they are really to be married!''  (<font color='red'><b>Elizabeth/Miss Bennet/Miss Elizabeth</b></font>)</div>cried Elizabeth, as soon as they
were by themselves. <div class="bookquote">``How strange this is! And for _this_ we are to be
thankful. That they should marry, small as is their chance of happiness,
and wretched as is his (<font color='blue'><b>Wickham</b></font>) character, we are forced to rejoice. Oh, Lydia!''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I comfort myself with thinking,''  (<font color='red'><b>Jane</b></font>)</div>replied Jane, <div class="bookquote">``that he (<font color='blue'><b>Wickham</b></font>) certainly would
not marry Lydia if he (<font color='blue'><b>Wickham</b></font>) had not a real regard for her (<font color='blue'><b>Lydia</b></font>). Though our kind
uncle has done something towards clearing him (<font color='blue'><b>uncle</b></font>), I cannot believe that ten
thousand pounds, or anything like it, has been advanced. He (<font color='blue'><b>uncle</b></font>) has children
of his (<font color='blue'><b>uncle</b></font>) own, and may have more. How could he (<font color='blue'><b>uncle</b></font>) spare half ten thousand
pounds?''

 (<font color='red'><b>Jane</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``If he (<font color='blue'><b>uncle</b></font>) were ever able to learn what Wickham's debts have been,''  (<font color='red'><b>Elizabeth/Miss Bennet/Miss Elizabeth</b></font>)</div>said
Elizabeth, <div class="bookquote">``and how much is settled on his (<font color='blue'><b>Wickham</b></font>) side on our sister, we shall
exactly know what Mr. Gardiner has done for them, because Wickham has
not sixpence of his (<font color='blue'><b>Wickham</b></font>) own. The kindness of my uncle and aunt can never
be requited. Their taking her (<font color='blue'><b>aunt</b></font>) home, and affording her (<font color='blue'><b>aunt</b></font>) their personal
protection and countenance, is such a sacrifice to her (<font color='blue'><b>aunt</b></font>) advantage as
years of gratitude cannot enough acknowledge. By this time she (<font color='blue'><b>aunt</b></font>) is
actually with them! If such goodness does not make her (<font color='blue'><b>aunt</b></font>) miserable now,
she (<font color='blue'><b>aunt</b></font>) will never deserve to be happy! What a meeting for her (<font color='blue'><b>aunt</b></font>), when she (<font color='blue'><b>aunt</b></font>)
first sees my aunt!''

 (<font color='red'><b>Elizabeth/Miss Bennet/Miss Elizabeth</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``We must endeavour to forget all that has passed on either side,''  (<font color='red'><b>Jane</b></font>)</div>said
Jane: <div class="bookquote">``I hope and trust they will yet be happy. His (<font color='blue'><b>my</b></font>) consenting to
marry her (<font color='blue'><b>aunt</b></font>) is a proof, I will believe, that he (<font color='blue'><b>my</b></font>) is come to a right way of
thinking. Their mutual affection will steady them; and I flatter myself
they will settle so quietly, and live in so rational a manner, as may in
time make their past imprudence forgotten.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Jane</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Their conduct has been such,''  (<font color='red'><b>Elizabeth/Miss Bennet/Miss Elizabeth</b></font>)</div>replied Elizabeth, <div class="bookquote">``as neither you, nor
I, nor anybody can ever forget. It is useless to talk of it.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Elizabeth/Miss Bennet/Miss Elizabeth</b></font>)</div><p/>It now occurred to the girls that their mother was in all likelihood
perfectly ignorant of what had happened. They went to the library,
therefore, and asked their father whether he (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) would not wish them to make
it known to her (<font color='blue'><b>Elizabeth</b></font>). He (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) was writing and, without raising his (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) head, coolly
replied:

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Just as you please.''

 (<font color='red'><b>He</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``May we take my uncle's letter to read to her (<font color='blue'><b>we</b></font>)?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Take whatever you like, and get away.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Elizabeth/Miss Bennet/Miss Elizabeth</b></font>)</div><p/>Elizabeth took the letter from his (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) writing-table, and they went up stairs
together. Mary and Kitty were both with Mrs. Bennet: one communication
would, therefore, do for all. After a slight preparation for good news,
the letter was read aloud. Mrs. Bennet could hardly contain herself. As
soon as Jane had read Mr. Gardiner's hope of Lydia's being soon
married, her (<font color='blue'><b>Lydia</b></font>) joy burst forth, and every following sentence added to its
exuberance. She (<font color='blue'><b>Lydia</b></font>) was now in an irritation as violent from delight, as she (<font color='blue'><b>Lydia</b></font>)
had ever been fidgety from alarm and vexation. To know that her (<font color='blue'><b>Lydia</b></font>) daughter
would be married was enough. She (<font color='blue'><b>Lydia</b></font>) was disturbed by no fear for her (<font color='blue'><b>Lydia</b></font>)
felicity, nor humbled by any remembrance of her (<font color='blue'><b>Lydia</b></font>) misconduct.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``My dear, dear Lydia!''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Lydia</b></font>) cried. <div class="bookquote">``This is delightful indeed! She (<font color='blue'><b>Lydia</b></font>) will
be married! I shall see her (<font color='blue'><b>Lydia</b></font>) again! She (<font color='blue'><b>Lydia</b></font>) will be married at sixteen!
My good, kind brother! I knew how it would be. I knew he (<font color='blue'><b>brother</b></font>) would manage
everything! How I long to see her (<font color='blue'><b>Lydia</b></font>)! and to see dear Wickham too! But the
clothes, the wedding clothes! I will write to my sister Gardiner about
them directly. Lizzy, my dear, run down to your father, and ask him (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>)
how much he (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) will give her (<font color='blue'><b>Lizzy</b></font>). Stay, stay, I will go myself. Ring the bell,
Kitty, for Hill. I will put on my things in a moment. My dear, dear
Lydia! How merry we shall be together when we meet!''

 (<font color='red'><b>daughter</b></font>)</div><p/>Her (<font color='blue'><b>Lydia</b></font>) eldest daughter endeavoured to give some relief to the violence of
these transports, by leading her (<font color='blue'><b>Lydia</b></font>) thoughts to the obligations which Mr.
Gardiner's behaviour laid them all under.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``For we must attribute this happy conclusion,''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Lydia</b></font>) added, <div class="bookquote">``in a great
measure to his (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) kindness. We are persuaded that he (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) has pledged himself to
assist Mr. Wickham with money.''

 (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Well,''  (<font color='red'><b>mother</b></font>)</div>cried her (<font color='blue'><b>Lydia</b></font>) mother, <div class="bookquote">``it is all very right; who should do it but
her (<font color='blue'><b>Lydia</b></font>) own uncle? If he (<font color='blue'><b>uncle</b></font>) had not had a family of his (<font color='blue'><b>uncle</b></font>) own, I and my children
must have had all his (<font color='blue'><b>uncle</b></font>) money, you know; and it is the first time we have
ever had anything from him (<font color='blue'><b>uncle</b></font>), except a few presents. Well! I am so happy!
In a short time I shall have a daughter married. Mrs. Wickham! How well
it sounds! And she (<font color='blue'><b>Wickham</b></font>) was only sixteen last June. My dear Jane, I am in
such a flutter, that I am sure I can't write; so I will dictate, and
you write for me. We will settle with your father about the money
afterwards; but the things should be ordered immediately.''

 (<font color='red'><b>mother</b></font>)</div><p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>Lydia</b></font>) was then proceeding to all the particulars of calico, muslin, and
cambric, and would shortly have dictated some very plentiful orders, had
not Jane, though with some difficulty, persuaded her (<font color='blue'><b>Jane</b></font>) to wait till her (<font color='blue'><b>Jane</b></font>)
father was at leisure to be consulted. One day's delay, she (<font color='blue'><b>Jane</b></font>) observed,
would be of small importance; and her (<font color='blue'><b>Jane</b></font>) mother was too happy to be quite
so obstinate as usual. Other schemes, too, came into her (<font color='blue'><b>Jane</b></font>) head.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``I will go to Meryton,''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>said she (<font color='blue'><b>Jane</b></font>), <div class="bookquote">``as soon as I am dressed, and tell the
good, good news to my sister Philips. And as I come back, I can call
on Lady Lucas and Mrs. Long. Kitty, run down and order the carriage.
An airing would do me a great deal of good, I am sure. Girls, can I do
anything for you in Meryton? Oh! Here comes Hill! My dear Hill, have you
heard the good news? Miss Lydia is going to be married; and you shall
all have a bowl of punch to make merry at her (<font color='blue'><b>Lydia</b></font>) wedding.''

 (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div><p/>Mrs. Hill began instantly to express her (<font color='blue'><b>Hill</b></font>) joy. Elizabeth received her (<font color='blue'><b>Elizabeth</b></font>)
congratulations amongst the rest, and then, sick of this folly, took
refuge in her (<font color='blue'><b>Elizabeth</b></font>) own room, that she (<font color='blue'><b>Elizabeth</b></font>) might think with freedom.

<p/>Poor Lydia's situation must, at best, be bad enough; but that it was
no worse, she (<font color='blue'><b>Lydia</b></font>) had need to be thankful. She (<font color='blue'><b>Lydia</b></font>) felt it so; and though, in
looking forward, neither rational happiness nor worldly prosperity could
be justly expected for her (<font color='blue'><b>Lydia</b></font>) sister, in looking back to what they had
feared, only two hours ago, she (<font color='blue'><b>Lydia</b></font>) felt all the advantages of what they had
gained.



<p/>Chapter 50


<p/>Mr. Bennet had very often wished before this period of his (<font color='blue'><b>Bennet</b></font>) life that,
instead of spending his (<font color='blue'><b>Bennet</b></font>) whole income, he (<font color='blue'><b>Bennet</b></font>) had laid by an annual sum for
the better provision of his (<font color='blue'><b>Bennet</b></font>) children, and of his (<font color='blue'><b>Bennet</b></font>) wife, if she (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>) survived
him (<font color='blue'><b>Bennet</b></font>). He (<font color='blue'><b>Bennet</b></font>) now wished it more than ever. Had he (<font color='blue'><b>Bennet</b></font>) done his (<font color='blue'><b>Bennet</b></font>) duty in that
respect, Lydia need not have been indebted to her (<font color='blue'><b>Lydia</b></font>) uncle for whatever
of honour or credit could now be purchased for her (<font color='blue'><b>Lydia</b></font>). The satisfaction of
prevailing on one of the most worthless young men in Great Britain to be
her (<font color='blue'><b>Lydia</b></font>) husband might then have rested in its proper place.

<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>husband</b></font>) was seriously concerned that a cause of so little advantage to anyone
should be forwarded at the sole expense of his (<font color='blue'><b>husband</b></font>) brother-in-law, and he (<font color='blue'><b>husband</b></font>)
was determined, if possible, to find out the extent of his (<font color='blue'><b>husband</b></font>) assistance,
and to discharge the obligation as soon as he (<font color='blue'><b>husband</b></font>) could.

<p/>When first Mr. Bennet had married, economy was held to be perfectly
useless, for, of course, they were to have a son. The son was to join
in cutting off the entail, as soon as he (<font color='blue'><b>son</b></font>) should be of age, and the widow
and younger children would by that means be provided for. Five daughters
successively entered the world, but yet the son was to come; and Mrs.
Bennet, for many years after Lydia's birth, had been certain that he (<font color='blue'><b>son</b></font>)
would. This event had at last been despaired of, but it was then
too late to be saving. Mrs. Bennet had no turn for economy, and her (<font color='blue'><b>Bennet</b></font>)
husband's love of independence had alone prevented their exceeding their
income.

<p/>Five thousand pounds was settled by marriage articles on Mrs. Bennet and
the children. But in what proportions it should be divided amongst the
latter depended on the will of the parents. This was one point, with
regard to Lydia, at least, which was now to be settled, and Mr. Bennet
could have no hesitation in acceding to the proposal before him (<font color='blue'><b>Bennet</b></font>). In
terms of grateful acknowledgment for the kindness of his (<font color='blue'><b>Bennet</b></font>) brother,
though expressed most concisely, he (<font color='blue'><b>Bennet</b></font>) then delivered on paper his (<font color='blue'><b>Bennet</b></font>) perfect
approbation of all that was done, and his (<font color='blue'><b>Bennet</b></font>) willingness to fulfil the
engagements that had been made for him (<font color='blue'><b>Bennet</b></font>). He (<font color='blue'><b>Bennet</b></font>) had never before supposed
that, could Wickham be prevailed on to marry his (<font color='blue'><b>Wickham</b></font>) daughter, it would
be done with so little inconvenience to himself as by the present
arrangement. He (<font color='blue'><b>Wickham</b></font>) would scarcely be ten pounds a year the loser by the
hundred that was to be paid them; for, what with her (<font color='blue'><b>daughter</b></font>) board and pocket
allowance, and the continual presents in money which passed to her (<font color='blue'><b>daughter</b></font>)
through her (<font color='blue'><b>daughter</b></font>) mother's hands, Lydia's expenses had been very little within
that sum.

<p/>That it would be done with such trifling exertion on his (<font color='blue'><b>Wickham</b></font>) side, too, was
another very welcome surprise; for his (<font color='blue'><b>Wickham</b></font>) wish at present was to have as
little trouble in the business as possible. When the first transports
of rage which had produced his (<font color='blue'><b>Wickham</b></font>) activity in seeking her (<font color='blue'><b>Lydia</b></font>) were over, he (<font color='blue'><b>Wickham</b></font>)
naturally returned to all his (<font color='blue'><b>Wickham</b></font>) former indolence. His (<font color='blue'><b>Wickham</b></font>) letter was soon
dispatched; for, though dilatory in undertaking business, he (<font color='blue'><b>Wickham</b></font>) was quick
in its execution. He (<font color='blue'><b>Wickham</b></font>) begged to know further particulars of what he (<font color='blue'><b>Wickham</b></font>)
was indebted to his (<font color='blue'><b>Wickham</b></font>) brother, but was too angry with Lydia to send any
message to her (<font color='blue'><b>Lydia</b></font>).

<p/>The good news spread quickly through the house, and with proportionate
speed through the neighbourhood. It was borne in the latter with decent
philosophy. To be sure, it would have been more for the advantage
of conversation had Miss Lydia Bennet come upon the town; or, as the
happiest alternative, been secluded from the world, in some distant
farmhouse. But there was much to be talked of in marrying her (<font color='blue'><b>Bennet</b></font>); and the
good-natured wishes for her (<font color='blue'><b>Bennet</b></font>) well-doing which had proceeded before from
all the spiteful old ladies in Meryton lost but a little of their spirit
in this change of circumstances, because with such an husband her (<font color='blue'><b>Bennet</b></font>) misery
was considered certain.

<p/>It was a fortnight since Mrs. Bennet had been downstairs; but on this
happy day she (<font color='blue'><b>Bennet</b></font>) again took her (<font color='blue'><b>Bennet</b></font>) seat at the head of her (<font color='blue'><b>Bennet</b></font>) table, and in
spirits oppressively high. No sentiment of shame gave a damp to her (<font color='blue'><b>Bennet</b></font>)
triumph. The marriage of a daughter, which had been the first object
of her (<font color='blue'><b>Bennet</b></font>) wishes since Jane was sixteen, was now on the point of
accomplishment, and her (<font color='blue'><b>Bennet</b></font>) thoughts and her (<font color='blue'><b>Bennet</b></font>) words ran wholly on those
attendants of elegant nuptials, fine muslins, new carriages, and
servants. She (<font color='blue'><b>Bennet</b></font>) was busily searching through the neighbourhood for a
proper situation for her (<font color='blue'><b>Bennet</b></font>) daughter, and, without knowing or considering
what their income might be, rejected many as deficient in size and
importance.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Haye Park might do,''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>said she (<font color='blue'><b>Bennet</b></font>), <div class="bookquote">``if the Gouldings could quit it--or the
great house at Stoke, if the drawing-room were larger; but Ashworth is
too far off! I could not bear to have her (<font color='blue'><b>Lydia</b></font>) ten miles from me; and as for
Pulvis Lodge, the attics are dreadful.''

 (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div><p/>Her (<font color='blue'><b>Bennet</b></font>) husband allowed her (<font color='blue'><b>Bennet</b></font>) to talk on without interruption while the
servants remained. But when they had withdrawn, he (<font color='blue'><b>husband</b></font>) said to her (<font color='blue'><b>Bennet</b></font>): <div class="bookquote">``Mrs.
Bennet, before you take any or all of these houses for your son and
daughter, let us come to a right understanding. Into _one_ house in this
neighbourhood they shall never have admittance. I will not encourage the
impudence of either, by receiving them at Longbourn.''

 (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div><p/>A long dispute followed this declaration; but Mr. Bennet was firm. It
soon led to another; and Mrs. Bennet found, with amazement and horror,
that her (<font color='blue'><b>Bennet</b></font>) husband would not advance a guinea to buy clothes for his (<font color='blue'><b>husband</b></font>)
daughter. He (<font color='blue'><b>husband</b></font>) protested that she (<font color='blue'><b>daughter</b></font>) should receive from him (<font color='blue'><b>husband</b></font>) no mark of
affection whatever on the occasion. Mrs. Bennet could hardly comprehend
it. That his (<font color='blue'><b>husband</b></font>) anger could be carried to such a point of inconceivable
resentment as to refuse his (<font color='blue'><b>husband</b></font>) daughter a privilege without which her (<font color='blue'><b>daughter</b></font>)
marriage would scarcely seem valid, exceeded all she (<font color='blue'><b>daughter</b></font>) could believe
possible. She (<font color='blue'><b>daughter</b></font>) was more alive to the disgrace which her (<font color='blue'><b>daughter</b></font>) want of new
clothes must reflect on her (<font color='blue'><b>daughter</b></font>) daughter's nuptials, than to any sense of
shame at her (<font color='blue'><b>daughter</b></font>) eloping and living with Wickham a fortnight before they
took place.

<p/>Elizabeth was now most heartily sorry that she (<font color='blue'><b>Elizabeth</b></font>) had, from the distress of
the moment, been led to make Mr. Darcy acquainted with their fears for
her (<font color='blue'><b>Elizabeth</b></font>) sister; for since her (<font color='blue'><b>Elizabeth</b></font>) marriage would so shortly give the
proper termination to the elopement, they might hope to conceal its
unfavourable beginning from all those who were not immediately on the
spot.

<p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>Elizabeth</b></font>) had no fear of its spreading farther through his (<font color='blue'><b>Darcy</b></font>) means. There were
few people on whose secrecy she (<font color='blue'><b>Elizabeth</b></font>) would have more confidently depended;
but, at the same time, there was no one whose knowledge of a sister's
frailty would have mortified her (<font color='blue'><b>sister</b></font>) so much--not, however, from any fear
of disadvantage from it individually to herself, for, at any rate,
there seemed a gulf impassable between them. Had Lydia's marriage been
concluded on the most honourable terms, it was not to be supposed that
Mr. Darcy would connect himself with a family where, to every other
objection, would now be added an alliance and relationship of the
nearest kind with a man whom he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) so justly scorned.

<p/>From such a connection she (<font color='blue'><b>Lydia</b></font>) could not wonder that he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) would shrink. The
wish of procuring her (<font color='blue'><b>Lydia</b></font>) regard, which she (<font color='blue'><b>Lydia</b></font>) had assured herself of his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>)
feeling in Derbyshire, could not in rational expectation survive such a
blow as this. She (<font color='blue'><b>Lydia</b></font>) was humbled, she (<font color='blue'><b>Lydia</b></font>) was grieved; she (<font color='blue'><b>Lydia</b></font>) repented, though she (<font color='blue'><b>Lydia</b></font>)
hardly knew of what. She (<font color='blue'><b>Lydia</b></font>) became jealous of his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) esteem, when she (<font color='blue'><b>Lydia</b></font>) could no
longer hope to be benefited by it. She (<font color='blue'><b>Lydia</b></font>) wanted to hear of him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>), when there
seemed the least chance of gaining intelligence. She (<font color='blue'><b>Lydia</b></font>) was convinced that
she (<font color='blue'><b>Lydia</b></font>) could have been happy with him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>), when it was no longer likely they
should meet.

<p/>What a triumph for him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>), as she (<font color='blue'><b>Lydia</b></font>) often thought, could he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) know that the
proposals which she (<font color='blue'><b>Lydia</b></font>) had proudly spurned only four months ago, would now
have been most gladly and gratefully received! He (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) was as generous, she (<font color='blue'><b>Lydia</b></font>)
doubted not, as the most generous of his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) sex; but while he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) was mortal,
there must be a triumph.

<p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>Lydia</b></font>) began now to comprehend that he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) was exactly the man who, in
disposition and talents, would most suit her (<font color='blue'><b>Lydia</b></font>). His (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) understanding and
temper, though unlike her (<font color='blue'><b>Lydia</b></font>) own, would have answered all her (<font color='blue'><b>Lydia</b></font>) wishes. It
was an union that must have been to the advantage of both; by her (<font color='blue'><b>Lydia</b></font>) ease
and liveliness, his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) mind might have been softened, his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) manners improved;
and from his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) judgement, information, and knowledge of the world, she (<font color='blue'><b>Lydia</b></font>)
must have received benefit of greater importance.

<p/>But no such happy marriage could now teach the admiring multitude what
connubial felicity really was. An union of a different tendency, and
precluding the possibility of the other, was soon to be formed in their
family.

<p/>How Wickham and Lydia were to be supported in tolerable independence,
she (<font color='blue'><b>Lydia</b></font>) could not imagine. But how little of permanent happiness could
belong to a couple who were only brought together because their passions
were stronger than their virtue, she (<font color='blue'><b>Lydia</b></font>) could easily conjecture.

<p/>* * * * *

<p/>Mr. Gardiner soon wrote again to his (<font color='blue'><b>Gardiner</b></font>) brother. To Mr. Bennet's
acknowledgments he (<font color='blue'><b>Gardiner</b></font>) briefly replied, with assurance of his (<font color='blue'><b>Gardiner</b></font>) eagerness to
promote the welfare of any of his (<font color='blue'><b>Gardiner</b></font>) family; and concluded with entreaties
that the subject might never be mentioned to him (<font color='blue'><b>Gardiner</b></font>) again. The principal
purport of his (<font color='blue'><b>Gardiner</b></font>) letter was to inform them that Mr. Wickham had resolved
on quitting the militia.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``It was greatly my wish that he (<font color='blue'><b>son</b></font>) should do so,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Wickham</b></font>) added, ``as soon as
his (<font color='blue'><b>son</b></font>) marriage was fixed on. And I think you will agree with me, in
considering the removal from that corps as highly advisable, both on
his (<font color='blue'><b>son</b></font>) account and my niece's. It is Mr. Wickham's intention to go into
the regulars; and among his (<font color='blue'><b>Wickham</b></font>) former friends, there are still some who
are able and willing to assist him (<font color='blue'><b>Wickham</b></font>) in the army. He (<font color='blue'><b>Wickham</b></font>) has the promise of an
ensigncy in General --'s regiment, now quartered in the North. It
is an advantage to have it so far from this part of the kingdom. He (<font color='blue'><b>General</b></font>)
promises fairly; and I hope among different people, where they may each
have a character to preserve, they will both be more prudent. I have
written to Colonel Forster, to inform him (<font color='blue'><b>Colonel</b></font>) of our present arrangements,
and to request that he (<font color='blue'><b>Colonel</b></font>) will satisfy the various creditors of Mr. Wickham
in and near Brighton, with assurances of speedy payment, for which I
have pledged myself. And will you give yourself the trouble of carrying
similar assurances to his (<font color='blue'><b>Wickham</b></font>) creditors in Meryton, of whom I shall subjoin
a list according to his (<font color='blue'><b>Wickham</b></font>) information? He (<font color='blue'><b>Wickham</b></font>) has given in all his (<font color='blue'><b>Wickham</b></font>) debts; I
hope at least he (<font color='blue'><b>Wickham</b></font>) has not deceived us. Haggerston has our directions,
and all will be completed in a week. They will then join his (<font color='blue'><b>Wickham</b></font>) regiment,
unless they are first invited to Longbourn; and I understand from Mrs.
Gardiner, that my niece is very desirous of seeing you all before she (<font color='blue'><b>niece</b></font>)
leaves the South. She (<font color='blue'><b>niece</b></font>) is well, and begs to be dutifully remembered to
you and her (<font color='blue'><b>niece</b></font>) mother.--Yours, etc.,

<p/><div class="bookquote">``E. GARDINER.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Bennet</b></font>)</div><p/>Mr. Bennet and his (<font color='blue'><b>Bennet</b></font>) daughters saw all the advantages of Wickham's removal
from the --shire as clearly as Mr. Gardiner could do. But Mrs. Bennet
was not so well pleased with it. Lydia's being settled in the North,
just when she (<font color='blue'><b>Lydia</b></font>) had expected most pleasure and pride in her (<font color='blue'><b>Lydia</b></font>) company,
for she (<font color='blue'><b>Lydia</b></font>) had by no means given up her (<font color='blue'><b>Lydia</b></font>) plan of their residing in
Hertfordshire, was a severe disappointment; and, besides, it was such a
pity that Lydia should be taken from a regiment where she (<font color='blue'><b>Lydia</b></font>) was acquainted
with everybody, and had so many favourites.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``She (<font color='blue'><b>niece</b></font>) is so fond of Mrs. Forster,''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>said she (<font color='blue'><b>Lydia</b></font>), <div class="bookquote">``it will be quite shocking
to send her (<font color='blue'><b>Forster</b></font>) away! And there are several of the young men, too, that she (<font color='blue'><b>Forster</b></font>)
likes very much. The officers may not be so pleasant in General --'s
regiment.''

 (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div><p/>His (<font color='blue'><b>Gardiner</b></font>) daughter's request, for such it might be considered, of being
admitted into her (<font color='blue'><b>Lydia</b></font>) family again before she (<font color='blue'><b>Lydia</b></font>) set off for the North,
received at first an absolute negative. But Jane and Elizabeth,
who agreed in wishing, for the sake of their sister's feelings and
consequence, that she (<font color='blue'><b>sister</b></font>) should be noticed on her (<font color='blue'><b>sister</b></font>) marriage by her (<font color='blue'><b>sister</b></font>) parents,
urged him (<font color='blue'><b>Gardiner</b></font>) so earnestly yet so rationally and so mildly, to receive her (<font color='blue'><b>sister</b></font>)
and her (<font color='blue'><b>sister</b></font>) husband at Longbourn, as soon as they were married, that he (<font color='blue'><b>husband</b></font>) was
prevailed on to think as they thought, and act as they wished. And their
mother had the satisfaction of knowing that she (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) would be able to show
her (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) married daughter in the neighbourhood before she (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) was banished to the
North. When Mr. Bennet wrote again to his (<font color='blue'><b>Bennet</b></font>) brother, therefore, he (<font color='blue'><b>Bennet</b></font>) sent
his (<font color='blue'><b>Bennet</b></font>) permission for them to come; and it was settled, that as soon as
the ceremony was over, they should proceed to Longbourn. Elizabeth was
surprised, however, that Wickham should consent to such a scheme, and
had she (<font color='blue'><b>Elizabeth</b></font>) consulted only her (<font color='blue'><b>Elizabeth</b></font>) own inclination, any meeting with him (<font color='blue'><b>Wickham</b></font>) would
have been the last object of her (<font color='blue'><b>Elizabeth</b></font>) wishes.



<p/>Chapter 51


<p/>Their sister's wedding day arrived; and Jane and Elizabeth felt for her (<font color='blue'><b>Jane</b></font>)
probably more than she (<font color='blue'><b>Jane</b></font>) felt for herself. The carriage was sent to
meet them at --, and they were to return in it by dinner-time. Their
arrival was dreaded by the elder Miss Bennets, and Jane more especially,
who gave Lydia the feelings which would have attended herself, had she (<font color='blue'><b>Lydia</b></font>)
been the culprit, and was wretched in the thought of what her (<font color='blue'><b>Lydia</b></font>) sister
must endure.

<p/>They came. The family were assembled in the breakfast room to receive
them. Smiles decked the face of Mrs. Bennet as the carriage drove up to
the door; her (<font color='blue'><b>Bennet</b></font>) husband looked impenetrably grave; her (<font color='blue'><b>Bennet</b></font>) daughters, alarmed,
anxious, uneasy.

<p/>Lydia's voice was heard in the vestibule; the door was thrown open, and
she (<font color='blue'><b>Lydia</b></font>) ran into the room. Her (<font color='blue'><b>Lydia</b></font>) mother stepped forwards, embraced her (<font color='blue'><b>Lydia</b></font>), and
welcomed her (<font color='blue'><b>Lydia</b></font>) with rapture; gave her (<font color='blue'><b>Lydia</b></font>) hand, with an affectionate smile,
to Wickham, who followed his (<font color='blue'><b>Wickham</b></font>) lady; and wished them both joy with an
alacrity which shewed no doubt of their happiness.

<p/>Their reception from Mr. Bennet, to whom they then turned, was not quite
so cordial. His (<font color='blue'><b>Bennet</b></font>) countenance rather gained in austerity; and he (<font color='blue'><b>Bennet</b></font>) scarcely
opened his (<font color='blue'><b>Bennet</b></font>) lips. The easy assurance of the young couple, indeed, was
enough to provoke him (<font color='blue'><b>Bennet</b></font>). Elizabeth was disgusted, and even Miss Bennet
was shocked. Lydia was Lydia still; untamed, unabashed, wild, noisy,
and fearless. She (<font color='blue'><b>Lydia</b></font>) turned from sister to sister, demanding their
congratulations; and when at length they all sat down, looked eagerly
round the room, took notice of some little alteration in it, and
observed, with a laugh, that it was a great while since she (<font color='blue'><b>Lydia</b></font>) had been
there.

<p/>Wickham was not at all more distressed than herself, but his (<font color='blue'><b>Wickham</b></font>) manners
were always so pleasing, that had his (<font color='blue'><b>Wickham</b></font>) character and his (<font color='blue'><b>Wickham</b></font>) marriage been
exactly what they ought, his (<font color='blue'><b>Wickham</b></font>) smiles and his (<font color='blue'><b>Wickham</b></font>) easy address, while he (<font color='blue'><b>Wickham</b></font>)
claimed their relationship, would have delighted them all. Elizabeth had
not before believed him (<font color='blue'><b>Wickham</b></font>) quite equal to such assurance; but she (<font color='blue'><b>Elizabeth</b></font>) sat down,
resolving within herself to draw no limits in future to the impudence
of an impudent man. She (<font color='blue'><b>Elizabeth</b></font>) blushed, and Jane blushed; but the cheeks of the
two who caused their confusion suffered no variation of colour.

<p/>There was no want of discourse. The bride and her (<font color='blue'><b>bride</b></font>) mother could neither
of them talk fast enough; and Wickham, who happened to sit near
Elizabeth, began inquiring after his (<font color='blue'><b>Wickham</b></font>) acquaintance in that neighbourhood,
with a good humoured ease which she (<font color='blue'><b>Elizabeth</b></font>) felt very unable to equal in her (<font color='blue'><b>Elizabeth</b></font>)
replies. They seemed each of them to have the happiest memories in the
world. Nothing of the past was recollected with pain; and Lydia led
voluntarily to subjects which her (<font color='blue'><b>Lydia</b></font>) sisters would not have alluded to for
the world.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Only think of its being three months,''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Lydia</b></font>) cried, <div class="bookquote">``since I went away;
it seems but a fortnight I declare; and yet there have been things
enough happened in the time. Good gracious! when I went away, I am sure
I had no more idea of being married till I came back again! though I
thought it would be very good fun if I was.''

 (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div><p/>Her (<font color='blue'><b>Lydia</b></font>) father lifted up his (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) eyes. Jane was distressed. Elizabeth looked
expressively at Lydia; but she (<font color='blue'><b>Elizabeth</b></font>), who never heard nor saw anything of
which she (<font color='blue'><b>Elizabeth</b></font>) chose to be insensible, gaily continued, <div class="bookquote">``Oh! mamma, do the
people hereabouts know I am married to-day? I was afraid they might not;
and we overtook William Goulding in his (<font color='blue'><b>William</b></font>) curricle, so I was determined he (<font color='blue'><b>William</b></font>)
should know it, and so I let down the side-glass next to him (<font color='blue'><b>William</b></font>), and took
off my glove, and let my hand just rest upon the window frame, so that
he (<font color='blue'><b>William</b></font>) might see the ring, and then I bowed and smiled like anything.''

 (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div><p/>Elizabeth could bear it no longer. She (<font color='blue'><b>Elizabeth</b></font>) got up, and ran out of the room;
and returned no more, till she (<font color='blue'><b>Elizabeth</b></font>) heard them passing through the hall to
the dining parlour. She (<font color='blue'><b>Elizabeth</b></font>) then joined them soon enough to see Lydia, with
anxious parade, walk up to her (<font color='blue'><b>Lydia</b></font>) mother's right hand, and hear her (<font color='blue'><b>Lydia</b></font>) say
to her (<font color='blue'><b>Lydia</b></font>) eldest sister, <div class="bookquote">``Ah! Jane, I take your place now, and you must go
lower, because I am a married woman.''

 (<font color='red'><b>sister</b></font>)</div><p/>It was not to be supposed that time would give Lydia that embarrassment
from which she (<font color='blue'><b>Lydia</b></font>) had been so wholly free at first. Her (<font color='blue'><b>Lydia</b></font>) ease and good
spirits increased. She (<font color='blue'><b>Lydia</b></font>) longed to see Mrs. Phillips, the Lucases, and
all their other neighbours, and to hear herself called <div class="bookquote">``Mrs. Wickham''
 (<font color='red'><b>all neighbours</b></font>)</div>by each of them; and in the mean time, she (<font color='blue'><b>Lydia</b></font>) went after dinner to show her (<font color='blue'><b>Lydia</b></font>)
ring, and boast of being married, to Mrs. Hill and the two housemaids.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Well, mamma,''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>said she (<font color='blue'><b>Hill</b></font>), when they were all returned to the breakfast
room, <div class="bookquote">``and what do you think of my husband? Is not he (<font color='blue'><b>husband</b></font>) a charming man? I
am sure my sisters must all envy me. I only hope they may have half
my good luck. They must all go to Brighton. That is the place to get
husbands. What a pity it is, mamma, we did not all go.''

 (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Very true; and if I had my will, we should. But my dear Lydia, I don't
at all like your going such a way off. Must it be so?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Oh, lord! yes;--there is nothing in that. I shall like it of all
things. You and papa, and my sisters, must come down and see us. We
shall be at Newcastle all the winter, and I dare say there will be some
balls, and I will take care to get good partners for them all.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I should like it beyond anything!''  (<font color='red'><b>mother</b></font>)</div>said her (<font color='blue'><b>Hill</b></font>) mother.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``And then when you go away, you may leave one or two of my sisters
behind you; and I dare say I shall get husbands for them before the
winter is over.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I thank you for my share of the favour,''  (<font color='red'><b>Elizabeth/Miss Bennet/Miss Elizabeth</b></font>)</div>said Elizabeth; <div class="bookquote">``but I do not
particularly like your way of getting husbands.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Elizabeth/Miss Bennet/Miss Elizabeth</b></font>)</div><p/>Their visitors were not to remain above ten days with them. Mr. Wickham
had received his (<font color='blue'><b>Wickham</b></font>) commission before he (<font color='blue'><b>Wickham</b></font>) left London, and he (<font color='blue'><b>Wickham</b></font>) was to join
his (<font color='blue'><b>Wickham</b></font>) regiment at the end of a fortnight.

<p/>No one but Mrs. Bennet regretted that their stay would be so short; and
she (<font color='blue'><b>Bennet</b></font>) made the most of the time by visiting about with her (<font color='blue'><b>Bennet</b></font>) daughter, and
having very frequent parties at home. These parties were acceptable to
all; to avoid a family circle was even more desirable to such as did
think, than such as did not.

<p/>Wickham's affection for Lydia was just what Elizabeth had expected
to find it; not equal to Lydia's for him (<font color='blue'><b>Wickham</b></font>). She (<font color='blue'><b>Lydia</b></font>) had scarcely needed her (<font color='blue'><b>Lydia</b></font>)
present observation to be satisfied, from the reason of things, that
their elopement had been brought on by the strength of her (<font color='blue'><b>Lydia</b></font>) love, rather
than by his (<font color='blue'><b>Wickham</b></font>); and she (<font color='blue'><b>Lydia</b></font>) would have wondered why, without violently caring
for her (<font color='blue'><b>Lydia</b></font>), he (<font color='blue'><b>Wickham</b></font>) chose to elope with her (<font color='blue'><b>Lydia</b></font>) at all, had she (<font color='blue'><b>Lydia</b></font>) not felt certain
that his (<font color='blue'><b>Wickham</b></font>) flight was rendered necessary by distress of circumstances; and
if that were the case, he (<font color='blue'><b>Wickham</b></font>) was not the young man to resist an opportunity
of having a companion.

<p/>Lydia was exceedingly fond of him (<font color='blue'><b>Wickham</b></font>). He (<font color='blue'><b>Wickham</b></font>) was her (<font color='blue'><b>Lydia</b></font>) dear Wickham on every
occasion; no one was to be put in competition with him (<font color='blue'><b>Wickham</b></font>). He (<font color='blue'><b>Wickham</b></font>) did every
thing best in the world; and she (<font color='blue'><b>Lydia</b></font>) was sure he (<font color='blue'><b>Wickham</b></font>) would kill more birds on
the first of September, than any body else in the country.

<p/>One morning, soon after their arrival, as she (<font color='blue'><b>Lydia</b></font>) was sitting with her (<font color='blue'><b>Lydia</b></font>) two
elder sisters, she (<font color='blue'><b>Lydia</b></font>) said to Elizabeth:

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Lizzy, I never gave _you_ an account of my wedding, I believe. You
were not by, when I told mamma and the others all about it. Are not you
curious to hear how it was managed?''

 (<font color='red'><b>Elizabeth/Miss Bennet/Miss Elizabeth</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``No really,''  (<font color='red'><b>Elizabeth/Miss Bennet/Miss Elizabeth</b></font>)</div>replied Elizabeth; <div class="bookquote">``I think there cannot be too little said
on the subject.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Elizabeth/Miss Bennet/Miss Elizabeth</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``La! You are so strange! But I must tell you how it went off. We were
married, you know, at St. Clement's, because Wickham's lodgings were in
that parish. And it was settled that we should all be there by eleven
o'clock. My uncle and aunt and I were to go together; and the others
were to meet us at the church. Well, Monday morning came, and I was in
such a fuss! I was so afraid, you know, that something would happen to
put it off, and then I should have gone quite distracted. And there was
my aunt, all the time I was dressing, preaching and talking away just as
if she (<font color='blue'><b>aunt</b></font>) was reading a sermon. However, I did not hear above one word in
ten, for I was thinking, you may suppose, of my dear Wickham. I longed
to know whether he (<font color='blue'><b>Wickham</b></font>) would be married in his (<font color='blue'><b>Wickham</b></font>) blue coat.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Well, and so we breakfasted at ten as usual; I thought it would never
be over; for, by the bye, you are to understand, that my uncle and aunt
were horrid unpleasant all the time I was with them. If you'll believe
me, I did not once put my foot out of doors, though I was there a
fortnight. Not one party, or scheme, or anything. To be sure London was
rather thin, but, however, the Little Theatre was open. Well, and so
just as the carriage came to the door, my uncle was called away upon
business to that horrid man Mr. Stone. And then, you know, when once
they get together, there is no end of it. Well, I was so frightened I
did not know what to do, for my uncle was to give me away; and if we
were beyond the hour, we could not be married all day. But, luckily, he (<font color='blue'><b>uncle</b></font>)
came back again in ten minutes' time, and then we all set out. However,
I recollected afterwards that if he (<font color='blue'><b>uncle</b></font>) had been prevented going, the
wedding need not be put off, for Mr. Darcy might have done as well.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Mr. Darcy!''  (<font color='red'><b>Elizabeth/Miss Bennet/Miss Elizabeth</b></font>)</div>repeated Elizabeth, in utter amazement.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Oh, yes!--he (<font color='blue'><b>Darcy</b></font>) was to come there with Wickham, you know. But gracious
me! I quite forgot! I ought not to have said a word about it. I promised
them so faithfully! What will Wickham say? It was to be such a secret!''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``If it was to be secret,''  (<font color='red'><b>Jane</b></font>)</div>said Jane, <div class="bookquote">``say not another word on the
subject. You may depend upon my seeking no further.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Jane</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Oh! certainly,''  (<font color='red'><b>Elizabeth/Miss Bennet/Miss Elizabeth</b></font>)</div>said Elizabeth, though burning with curiosity; <div class="bookquote">``we will
ask you no questions.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Elizabeth/Miss Bennet/Miss Elizabeth</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Thank you,''  (<font color='red'><b>Lydia/Miss Lydia/Miss Lydia Bennet</b></font>)</div>said Lydia, <div class="bookquote">``for if you did, I should certainly tell you
all, and then Wickham would be angry.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Lydia/Miss Lydia/Miss Lydia Bennet</b></font>)</div><p/>On such encouragement to ask, Elizabeth was forced to put it out of her (<font color='blue'><b>Elizabeth</b></font>)
power, by running away.

<p/>But to live in ignorance on such a point was impossible; or at least
it was impossible not to try for information. Mr. Darcy had been at
her (<font color='blue'><b>Elizabeth</b></font>) sister's wedding. It was exactly a scene, and exactly among people,
where he (<font color='blue'><b>Darcy</b></font>) had apparently least to do, and least temptation to go.
Conjectures as to the meaning of it, rapid and wild, hurried into her (<font color='blue'><b>Elizabeth</b></font>)
brain; but she (<font color='blue'><b>Elizabeth</b></font>) was satisfied with none. Those that best pleased her (<font color='blue'><b>Elizabeth</b></font>), as
placing his (<font color='blue'><b>Darcy</b></font>) conduct in the noblest light, seemed most improbable. She (<font color='blue'><b>Elizabeth</b></font>)
could not bear such suspense; and hastily seizing a sheet of paper,
wrote a short letter to her (<font color='blue'><b>Elizabeth</b></font>) aunt, to request an explanation of what
Lydia had dropt, if it were compatible with the secrecy which had been
intended.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``You may readily comprehend,''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Lydia</b></font>) added, <div class="bookquote">``what my curiosity must be
to know how a person unconnected with any of us, and -LRB-comparatively
speaking-RRB- a stranger to our family, should have been amongst you at such
a time. Pray write instantly, and let me understand it--unless it is,
for very cogent reasons, to remain in the secrecy which Lydia seems
to think necessary; and then I must endeavour to be satisfied with
ignorance.''

 (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Not that I _shall_, though,''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Lydia</b></font>) added to herself, as she (<font color='blue'><b>Lydia</b></font>) finished
the letter; <div class="bookquote">``and my dear aunt, if you do not tell me in an honourable
manner, I shall certainly be reduced to tricks and stratagems to find it
out.''

 (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div><p/>Jane's delicate sense of honour would not allow her (<font color='blue'><b>Lydia</b></font>) to speak to
Elizabeth privately of what Lydia had let fall; Elizabeth was glad
of it;--till it appeared whether her (<font color='blue'><b>Elizabeth</b></font>) inquiries would receive any
satisfaction, she (<font color='blue'><b>Elizabeth</b></font>) had rather be without a confidante.



<p/>Chapter 52


<p/>Elizabeth had the satisfaction of receiving an answer to her (<font color='blue'><b>Elizabeth</b></font>) letter as
soon as she (<font color='blue'><b>Elizabeth</b></font>) possibly could. She (<font color='blue'><b>Elizabeth</b></font>) was no sooner in possession of it
than, hurrying into the little copse, where she (<font color='blue'><b>Elizabeth</b></font>) was least likely to
be interrupted, she (<font color='blue'><b>Elizabeth</b></font>) sat down on one of the benches and prepared to
be happy; for the length of the letter convinced her (<font color='blue'><b>Elizabeth</b></font>) that it did not
contain a denial.

<p/>``Gracechurch street, Sept. 6.

<p/>``MY DEAR NIECE,

<p/>``I have just received your letter, and shall devote this whole morning
to answering it, as I foresee that a _little_ writing will not comprise
what I have to tell you. I must confess myself surprised by your
application; I did not expect it from _you_. Don't think me angry,
however, for I only mean to let you know that I had not imagined such
inquiries to be necessary on _your_ side. If you do not choose to
understand me, forgive my impertinence. Your uncle is as much surprised
as I am--and nothing but the belief of your being a party concerned
would have allowed him (<font color='blue'><b>uncle</b></font>) to act as he (<font color='blue'><b>uncle</b></font>) has done. But if you are really
innocent and ignorant, I must be more explicit.

<p/>``On the very day of my coming home from Longbourn, your uncle had a most
unexpected visitor. Mr. Darcy called, and was shut up with him (<font color='blue'><b>Darcy</b></font>) several
hours. It was all over before I arrived; so my curiosity was not so
dreadfully racked as _yours_ seems to have been. He (<font color='blue'><b>Darcy</b></font>) came to tell Mr.
Gardiner that he (<font color='blue'><b>Darcy</b></font>) had found out where your sister and Mr. Wickham were,
and that he (<font color='blue'><b>Wickham</b></font>) had seen and talked with them both; Wickham repeatedly,
Lydia once. From what I can collect, he (<font color='blue'><b>Wickham</b></font>) left Derbyshire only one day
after ourselves, and came to town with the resolution of hunting for
them. The motive professed was his (<font color='blue'><b>Wickham</b></font>) conviction of its being owing to
himself that Wickham's worthlessness had not been so well known as to
make it impossible for any young woman of character to love or confide
in him (<font color='blue'><b>character</b></font>). He (<font color='blue'><b>character</b></font>) generously imputed the whole to his (<font color='blue'><b>character</b></font>) mistaken pride, and
confessed that he (<font color='blue'><b>character</b></font>) had before thought it beneath him (<font color='blue'><b>character</b></font>) to lay his (<font color='blue'><b>character</b></font>) private
actions open to the world. His (<font color='blue'><b>character</b></font>) character was to speak for itself. He (<font color='blue'><b>character</b></font>)
called it, therefore, his (<font color='blue'><b>character</b></font>) duty to step forward, and endeavour to remedy
an evil which had been brought on by himself. If he (<font color='blue'><b>character</b></font>) _had another_
motive, I am sure it would never disgrace him (<font color='blue'><b>character</b></font>). He (<font color='blue'><b>character</b></font>) had been some days
in town, before he (<font color='blue'><b>character</b></font>) was able to discover them; but he (<font color='blue'><b>character</b></font>) had something to
direct his (<font color='blue'><b>character</b></font>) search, which was more than _we_ had; and the consciousness
of this was another reason for his (<font color='blue'><b>character</b></font>) resolving to follow us.

<p/>``There is a lady, it seems, a Mrs. Younge, who was some time ago
governess to Miss Darcy, and was dismissed from her (<font color='blue'><b>Darcy</b></font>) charge on some cause
of disapprobation, though he (<font color='blue'><b>character</b></font>) did not say what. She (<font color='blue'><b>Darcy</b></font>) then took a large
house in Edward-street, and has since maintained herself by letting
lodgings. This Mrs. Younge was, he (<font color='blue'><b>character</b></font>) knew, intimately acquainted with
Wickham; and he (<font color='blue'><b>character</b></font>) went to her (<font color='blue'><b>Younge</b></font>) for intelligence of him (<font color='blue'><b>character</b></font>) as soon as he (<font color='blue'><b>character</b></font>) got to
town. But it was two or three days before he (<font color='blue'><b>character</b></font>) could get from her (<font color='blue'><b>Younge</b></font>) what he (<font color='blue'><b>character</b></font>)
wanted. She (<font color='blue'><b>Younge</b></font>) would not betray her (<font color='blue'><b>Younge</b></font>) trust, I suppose, without bribery and
corruption, for she (<font color='blue'><b>Younge</b></font>) really did know where her (<font color='blue'><b>Younge</b></font>) friend was to be found.
Wickham indeed had gone to her (<font color='blue'><b>Younge</b></font>) on their first arrival in London, and had
she (<font color='blue'><b>Younge</b></font>) been able to receive them into her (<font color='blue'><b>Younge</b></font>) house, they would have taken up
their abode with her (<font color='blue'><b>Younge</b></font>). At length, however, our kind friend procured the
wished-for direction. They were in -- street. He (<font color='blue'><b>friend</b></font>) saw Wickham, and
afterwards insisted on seeing Lydia. His (<font color='blue'><b>Wickham</b></font>) first object with her (<font color='blue'><b>Lydia</b></font>), he (<font color='blue'><b>Wickham</b></font>)
acknowledged, had been to persuade her (<font color='blue'><b>Lydia</b></font>) to quit her (<font color='blue'><b>Lydia</b></font>) present disgraceful
situation, and return to her (<font color='blue'><b>Lydia</b></font>) friends as soon as they could be prevailed
on to receive her (<font color='blue'><b>Lydia</b></font>), offering his (<font color='blue'><b>Wickham</b></font>) assistance, as far as it would go. But
he (<font color='blue'><b>Wickham</b></font>) found Lydia absolutely resolved on remaining where she (<font color='blue'><b>Lydia</b></font>) was. She (<font color='blue'><b>Lydia</b></font>) cared
for none of her (<font color='blue'><b>Lydia</b></font>) friends; she (<font color='blue'><b>Lydia</b></font>) wanted no help of his (<font color='blue'><b>Wickham</b></font>); she (<font color='blue'><b>Lydia</b></font>) would not hear
of leaving Wickham. She (<font color='blue'><b>Lydia</b></font>) was sure they should be married some time or
other, and it did not much signify when. Since such were her (<font color='blue'><b>Lydia</b></font>) feelings,
it only remained, he (<font color='blue'><b>Wickham</b></font>) thought, to secure and expedite a marriage, which,
in his (<font color='blue'><b>Wickham</b></font>) very first conversation with Wickham, he (<font color='blue'><b>Wickham</b></font>) easily learnt had never
been _his (<font color='blue'><b>Wickham</b></font>)_ design. He (<font color='blue'><b>Wickham</b></font>) confessed himself obliged to leave the regiment,
on account of some debts of honour, which were very pressing; and
scrupled not to lay all the ill-consequences of Lydia's flight on her (<font color='blue'><b>Lydia</b></font>)
own folly alone. He (<font color='blue'><b>Wickham</b></font>) meant to resign his (<font color='blue'><b>Wickham</b></font>) commission immediately; and as
to his (<font color='blue'><b>Wickham</b></font>) future situation, he (<font color='blue'><b>Wickham</b></font>) could conjecture very little about it. He (<font color='blue'><b>Wickham</b></font>)
must go somewhere, but he (<font color='blue'><b>Wickham</b></font>) did not know where, and he (<font color='blue'><b>Wickham</b></font>) knew he (<font color='blue'><b>Wickham</b></font>) should have
nothing to live on.

<p/>``Mr. Darcy asked him (<font color='blue'><b>Darcy</b></font>) why he (<font color='blue'><b>Darcy</b></font>) had not married your sister at once. Though
Mr. Bennet was not imagined to be very rich, he (<font color='blue'><b>Bennet</b></font>) would have been able
to do something for him (<font color='blue'><b>Bennet</b></font>), and his (<font color='blue'><b>Bennet</b></font>) situation must have been benefited by
marriage. But he (<font color='blue'><b>Bennet</b></font>) found, in reply to this question, that Wickham still
cherished the hope of more effectually making his (<font color='blue'><b>Wickham</b></font>) fortune by marriage in
some other country. Under such circumstances, however, he (<font color='blue'><b>Wickham</b></font>) was not likely
to be proof against the temptation of immediate relief.

<p/>``They met several times, for there was much to be discussed. Wickham of
course wanted more than he (<font color='blue'><b>Wickham</b></font>) could get; but at length was reduced to be
reasonable.

<p/>``Every thing being settled between _them_, Mr. Darcy's next step was to
make your uncle acquainted with it, and he (<font color='blue'><b>uncle</b></font>) first called in Gracechurch
street the evening before I came home. But Mr. Gardiner could not be
seen, and Mr. Darcy found, on further inquiry, that your father was
still with him (<font color='blue'><b>Darcy</b></font>), but would quit town the next morning. He (<font color='blue'><b>Darcy</b></font>) did not judge
your father to be a person whom he (<font color='blue'><b>Darcy</b></font>) could so properly consult as your
uncle, and therefore readily postponed seeing him (<font color='blue'><b>Darcy</b></font>) till after the
departure of the former. He (<font color='blue'><b>Darcy</b></font>) did not leave his (<font color='blue'><b>Darcy</b></font>) name, and till the next
day it was only known that a gentleman had called on business.

<p/>``On Saturday he (<font color='blue'><b>gentleman</b></font>) came again. Your father was gone, your uncle at home,
and, as I said before, they had a great deal of talk together.

<p/>``They met again on Sunday, and then _I_ saw him (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) too. It was not all
settled before Monday: as soon as it was, the express was sent off to
Longbourn. But our visitor was very obstinate. I fancy, Lizzy, that
obstinacy is the real defect of his (<font color='blue'><b>visitor</b></font>) character, after all. He (<font color='blue'><b>visitor</b></font>) has been
accused of many faults at different times, but _this_ is the true one.
Nothing was to be done that he (<font color='blue'><b>visitor</b></font>) did not do himself; though I am sure -LRB-and
I do not speak it to be thanked, therefore say nothing about it-RRB-, your
uncle would most readily have settled the whole.

<p/>``They battled it together for a long time, which was more than either
the gentleman or lady concerned in it deserved. But at last your uncle
was forced to yield, and instead of being allowed to be of use to his (<font color='blue'><b>uncle</b></font>)
niece, was forced to put up with only having the probable credit of it,
which went sorely against the grain; and I really believe your letter
this morning gave him (<font color='blue'><b>uncle</b></font>) great pleasure, because it required an explanation
that would rob him (<font color='blue'><b>uncle</b></font>) of his (<font color='blue'><b>uncle</b></font>) borrowed feathers, and give the praise where
it was due. But, Lizzy, this must go no farther than yourself, or Jane
at most.

<p/>``You know pretty well, I suppose, what has been done for the young
people. His (<font color='blue'><b>uncle</b></font>) debts are to be paid, amounting, I believe, to considerably
more than a thousand pounds, another thousand in addition to her (<font color='blue'><b>Jane</b></font>) own
settled upon _her (<font color='blue'><b>Jane</b></font>)_, and his (<font color='blue'><b>uncle</b></font>) commission purchased. The reason why all
this was to be done by him (<font color='blue'><b>uncle</b></font>) alone, was such as I have given above. It
was owing to him (<font color='blue'><b>uncle</b></font>), to his (<font color='blue'><b>uncle</b></font>) reserve and want of proper consideration, that
Wickham's character had been so misunderstood, and consequently that he (<font color='blue'><b>character</b></font>)
had been received and noticed as he (<font color='blue'><b>character</b></font>) was. Perhaps there was some truth
in _this_; though I doubt whether _his (<font color='blue'><b>character</b></font>)_ reserve, or _anybody's_ reserve,
can be answerable for the event. But in spite of all this fine talking,
my dear Lizzy, you may rest perfectly assured that your uncle would
never have yielded, if we had not given him (<font color='blue'><b>uncle</b></font>) credit for _another
interest_ in the affair.

<p/>``When all this was resolved on, he (<font color='blue'><b>uncle</b></font>) returned again to his (<font color='blue'><b>uncle</b></font>) friends, who
were still staying at Pemberley; but it was agreed that he (<font color='blue'><b>uncle</b></font>) should be in
London once more when the wedding took place, and all money matters were
then to receive the last finish.

<p/>``I believe I have now told you every thing. It is a relation which
you tell me is to give you great surprise; I hope at least it will not
afford you any displeasure. Lydia came to us; and Wickham had constant
admission to the house. _He (<font color='blue'><b>Wickham</b></font>)_ was exactly what he (<font color='blue'><b>Wickham</b></font>) had been, when I
knew him (<font color='blue'><b>Wickham</b></font>) in Hertfordshire; but I would not tell you how little I was
satisfied with her (<font color='blue'><b>Lydia</b></font>) behaviour while she (<font color='blue'><b>Lydia</b></font>) staid with us, if I had not
perceived, by Jane's letter last Wednesday, that her (<font color='blue'><b>Jane</b></font>) conduct on coming
home was exactly of a piece with it, and therefore what I now tell
you can give you no fresh pain. I talked to her (<font color='blue'><b>Jane</b></font>) repeatedly in the most
serious manner, representing to her (<font color='blue'><b>Jane</b></font>) all the wickedness of what she (<font color='blue'><b>Jane</b></font>) had
done, and all the unhappiness she (<font color='blue'><b>Jane</b></font>) had brought on her (<font color='blue'><b>Jane</b></font>) family. If she (<font color='blue'><b>Jane</b></font>)
heard me, it was by good luck, for I am sure she (<font color='blue'><b>Jane</b></font>) did not listen. I was
sometimes quite provoked, but then I recollected my dear Elizabeth and
Jane, and for their sakes had patience with her (<font color='blue'><b>Jane</b></font>).

<p/>``Mr. Darcy was punctual in his (<font color='blue'><b>Darcy</b></font>) return, and as Lydia informed you,
attended the wedding. He (<font color='blue'><b>Darcy</b></font>) dined with us the next day, and was to leave
town again on Wednesday or Thursday. Will you be very angry with me, my
dear Lizzy, if I take this opportunity of saying -LRB-what I was never bold
enough to say before-RRB- how much I like him (<font color='blue'><b>Darcy</b></font>). His (<font color='blue'><b>Darcy</b></font>) behaviour to us has,
in every respect, been as pleasing as when we were in Derbyshire. His (<font color='blue'><b>Darcy</b></font>)
understanding and opinions all please me; he (<font color='blue'><b>Darcy</b></font>) wants nothing but a little
more liveliness, and _that_, if he (<font color='blue'><b>Darcy</b></font>) marry _prudently_, his (<font color='blue'><b>Darcy</b></font>) wife may teach
him (<font color='blue'><b>Darcy</b></font>). I thought him (<font color='blue'><b>Darcy</b></font>) very sly;--he (<font color='blue'><b>Darcy</b></font>) hardly ever mentioned your name. But
slyness seems the fashion.

<p/>``Pray forgive me if I have been very presuming, or at least do not
punish me so far as to exclude me from P. I shall never be quite happy
till I have been all round the park. A low phaeton, with a nice little
pair of ponies, would be the very thing.

<p/>``But I must write no more. The children have been wanting me this half
hour.

<p/>``Yours, very sincerely,

<p/><div class="bookquote">``M. GARDINER.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Elizabeth/Miss Bennet/Miss Elizabeth</b></font>)</div><p/>The contents of this letter threw Elizabeth into a flutter of spirits,
in which it was difficult to determine whether pleasure or pain bore the
greatest share. The vague and unsettled suspicions which uncertainty had
produced of what Mr. Darcy might have been doing to forward her (<font color='blue'><b>Elizabeth</b></font>) sister's
match, which she (<font color='blue'><b>Elizabeth</b></font>) had feared to encourage as an exertion of goodness too
great to be probable, and at the same time dreaded to be just, from the
pain of obligation, were proved beyond their greatest extent to be true!
He (<font color='blue'><b>Darcy</b></font>) had followed them purposely to town, he (<font color='blue'><b>Darcy</b></font>) had taken on himself all
the trouble and mortification attendant on such a research; in which
supplication had been necessary to a woman whom he (<font color='blue'><b>Darcy</b></font>) must abominate and
despise, and where he (<font color='blue'><b>Darcy</b></font>) was reduced to meet, frequently meet, reason
with, persuade, and finally bribe, the man whom he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) always most wished to
avoid, and whose very name it was punishment to him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) to pronounce. He (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) had
done all this for a girl whom he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) could neither regard nor esteem. Her (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>)
heart did whisper that he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) had done it for her (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>). But it was a hope shortly
checked by other considerations, and she (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) soon felt that even her (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) vanity
was insufficient, when required to depend on his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) affection for her (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>)--for
a woman who had already refused him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>)--as able to overcome a sentiment so
natural as abhorrence against relationship with Wickham. Brother-in-law
of Wickham! Every kind of pride must revolt from the connection. He (<font color='blue'><b>Wickham</b></font>) had,
to be sure, done much. She (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) was ashamed to think how much. But he (<font color='blue'><b>Wickham</b></font>) had
given a reason for his (<font color='blue'><b>Wickham</b></font>) interference, which asked no extraordinary
stretch of belief. It was reasonable that he (<font color='blue'><b>Wickham</b></font>) should feel he (<font color='blue'><b>Wickham</b></font>) had been
wrong; he (<font color='blue'><b>Wickham</b></font>) had liberality, and he (<font color='blue'><b>Wickham</b></font>) had the means of exercising it; and
though she (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) would not place herself as his (<font color='blue'><b>Wickham</b></font>) principal inducement, she (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>)
could, perhaps, believe that remaining partiality for her (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) might assist
his (<font color='blue'><b>Wickham</b></font>) endeavours in a cause where her (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) peace of mind must be materially
concerned. It was painful, exceedingly painful, to know that they were
under obligations to a person who could never receive a return. They
owed the restoration of Lydia, her (<font color='blue'><b>Lydia</b></font>) character, every thing, to him (<font color='blue'><b>character</b></font>). Oh!
how heartily did she (<font color='blue'><b>Lydia</b></font>) grieve over every ungracious sensation she (<font color='blue'><b>Lydia</b></font>) had ever
encouraged, every saucy speech she (<font color='blue'><b>Lydia</b></font>) had ever directed towards him (<font color='blue'><b>character</b></font>). For
herself she (<font color='blue'><b>Lydia</b></font>) was humbled; but she (<font color='blue'><b>Lydia</b></font>) was proud of him (<font color='blue'><b>character</b></font>). Proud that in a cause
of compassion and honour, he (<font color='blue'><b>character</b></font>) had been able to get the better of himself.
She (<font color='blue'><b>Lydia</b></font>) read over her (<font color='blue'><b>Lydia</b></font>) aunt's commendation of him (<font color='blue'><b>character</b></font>) again and again. It
was hardly enough; but it pleased her (<font color='blue'><b>Lydia</b></font>). She (<font color='blue'><b>Lydia</b></font>) was even sensible of some
pleasure, though mixed with regret, on finding how steadfastly both she (<font color='blue'><b>Lydia</b></font>)
and her (<font color='blue'><b>Lydia</b></font>) uncle had been persuaded that affection and confidence subsisted
between Mr. Darcy and herself.

<p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>Lydia</b></font>) was roused from her (<font color='blue'><b>Lydia</b></font>) seat, and her (<font color='blue'><b>Lydia</b></font>) reflections, by some one's
approach; and before she (<font color='blue'><b>Lydia</b></font>) could strike into another path, she (<font color='blue'><b>Lydia</b></font>) was
overtaken by Wickham.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``I am afraid I interrupt your solitary ramble, my dear sister?''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>said he (<font color='blue'><b>Wickham</b></font>),
as he (<font color='blue'><b>Wickham</b></font>) joined her (<font color='blue'><b>Lydia</b></font>).

<p/><div class="bookquote">``You certainly do,''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Lydia</b></font>) replied with a smile; <div class="bookquote">``but it does not follow
that the interruption must be unwelcome.''

 (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I should be sorry indeed, if it were. We were always good friends; and
now we are better.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``True. Are the others coming out?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I do not know. Mrs. Bennet and Lydia are going in the carriage to
Meryton. And so, my dear sister, I find, from our uncle and aunt, that
you have actually seen Pemberley.''

 (<font color='red'><b>She</b></font>)</div><p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>Lydia</b></font>) replied in the affirmative.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``I almost envy you the pleasure, and yet I believe it would be too much
for me, or else I could take it in my way to Newcastle. And you saw the
old housekeeper, I suppose? Poor Reynolds, she (<font color='blue'><b>housekeeper</b></font>) was always very fond of
me. But of course she (<font color='blue'><b>housekeeper</b></font>) did not mention my name to you.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Yes, she (<font color='blue'><b>housekeeper</b></font>) did.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``And what did she (<font color='blue'><b>housekeeper</b></font>) say?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``That you were gone into the army, and she (<font color='blue'><b>housekeeper</b></font>) was afraid had--not turned
out well. At such a distance as _that_, you know, things are strangely
misrepresented.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Certainly,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Wickham</b></font>) replied, biting his (<font color='blue'><b>Wickham</b></font>) lips. Elizabeth hoped she (<font color='blue'><b>Elizabeth</b></font>) had
silenced him (<font color='blue'><b>Wickham</b></font>); but he (<font color='blue'><b>Wickham</b></font>) soon afterwards said:

<p/><div class="bookquote">``I was surprised to see Darcy in town last month. We passed each other
several times. I wonder what he (<font color='blue'><b>Darcy</b></font>) can be doing there.''

 (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Perhaps preparing for his (<font color='blue'><b>Darcy</b></font>) marriage with Miss de Bourgh,''  (<font color='red'><b>Elizabeth/Miss Bennet/Miss Elizabeth</b></font>)</div>said
Elizabeth. <div class="bookquote">``It must be something particular, to take him (<font color='blue'><b>Darcy</b></font>) there at this
time of year.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Undoubtedly. Did you see him (<font color='blue'><b>Darcy</b></font>) while you were at Lambton? I thought I
understood from the Gardiners that you had.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Yes; he (<font color='blue'><b>Darcy</b></font>) introduced us to his (<font color='blue'><b>Darcy</b></font>) sister.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``And do you like her (<font color='blue'><b>sister</b></font>)?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Very much.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I have heard, indeed, that she (<font color='blue'><b>sister</b></font>) is uncommonly improved within this year
or two. When I last saw her (<font color='blue'><b>sister</b></font>), she (<font color='blue'><b>sister</b></font>) was not very promising. I am very glad
you liked her (<font color='blue'><b>sister</b></font>). I hope she (<font color='blue'><b>sister</b></font>) will turn out well.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I dare say she (<font color='blue'><b>sister</b></font>) will; she (<font color='blue'><b>sister</b></font>) has got over the most trying age.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Did you go by the village of Kympton?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I do not recollect that we did.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I mention it, because it is the living which I ought to have had. A
most delightful place!--Excellent Parsonage House! It would have suited
me in every respect.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``How should you have liked making sermons?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Exceedingly well. I should have considered it as part of my duty,
and the exertion would soon have been nothing. One ought not to
repine;--but, to be sure, it would have been such a thing for me! The
quiet, the retirement of such a life would have answered all my ideas
of happiness! But it was not to be. Did you ever hear Darcy mention the
circumstance, when you were in Kent?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I have heard from authority, which I thought _as good_, that it was
left you conditionally only, and at the will of the present patron.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``You have. Yes, there was something in _that_; I told you so from the
first, you may remember.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I _did_ hear, too, that there was a time, when sermon-making was not
so palatable to you as it seems to be at present; that you actually
declared your resolution of never taking orders, and that the business
had been compromised accordingly.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``You did! and it was not wholly without foundation. You may remember
what I told you on that point, when first we talked of it.''

 (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div><p/>They were now almost at the door of the house, for she (<font color='blue'><b>Elizabeth</b></font>) had walked fast
to get rid of him (<font color='blue'><b>Wickham</b></font>); and unwilling, for her (<font color='blue'><b>Elizabeth</b></font>) sister's sake, to provoke him (<font color='blue'><b>Wickham</b></font>),
she (<font color='blue'><b>Elizabeth</b></font>) only said in reply, with a good-humoured smile:

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Come, Mr. Wickham, we are brother and sister, you know. Do not let
us quarrel about the past. In future, I hope we shall be always of one
mind.''

 (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div><p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>Elizabeth</b></font>) held out her (<font color='blue'><b>Elizabeth</b></font>) hand; he (<font color='blue'><b>Wickham</b></font>) kissed it with affectionate gallantry, though
he (<font color='blue'><b>Wickham</b></font>) hardly knew how to look, and they entered the house.



<p/>Chapter 53


<p/>Mr. Wickham was so perfectly satisfied with this conversation that he (<font color='blue'><b>Wickham</b></font>)
never again distressed himself, or provoked his (<font color='blue'><b>Wickham</b></font>) dear sister Elizabeth,
by introducing the subject of it; and she (<font color='blue'><b>Elizabeth</b></font>) was pleased to find that she (<font color='blue'><b>Elizabeth</b></font>)
had said enough to keep him (<font color='blue'><b>Wickham</b></font>) quiet.

<p/>The day of his (<font color='blue'><b>Wickham</b></font>) and Lydia's departure soon came, and Mrs. Bennet was
forced to submit to a separation, which, as her (<font color='blue'><b>Bennet</b></font>) husband by no means
entered into her (<font color='blue'><b>Bennet</b></font>) scheme of their all going to Newcastle, was likely to
continue at least a twelvemonth.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Oh! my dear Lydia,''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Bennet</b></font>) cried, <div class="bookquote">``when shall we meet again?''

 (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Oh, lord! I don't know. Not these two or three years, perhaps.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Write to me very often, my dear.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``As often as I can. But you know married women have never much time for
writing. My sisters may write to _me_. They will have nothing else to
do.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Wickham/Mr. Wickham</b></font>)</div><p/>Mr. Wickham's adieus were much more affectionate than his (<font color='blue'><b>Wickham</b></font>) wife's. He (<font color='blue'><b>Wickham</b></font>)
smiled, looked handsome, and said many pretty things.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``He (<font color='blue'><b>lord</b></font>) is as fine a fellow,''  (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Bennet</b></font>)</div>said Mr. Bennet, as soon as they were out of
the house, <div class="bookquote">``as ever I saw. He (<font color='blue'><b>lord</b></font>) simpers, and smirks, and makes love to
us all. I am prodigiously proud of him (<font color='blue'><b>lord</b></font>). I defy even Sir William Lucas
himself to produce a more valuable son-in-law.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Bennet</b></font>)</div><p/>The loss of her (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>) daughter made Mrs. Bennet very dull for several days.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``I often think,''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>said she (<font color='blue'><b>Bennet</b></font>), <div class="bookquote">``that there is nothing so bad as parting with
one's friends. One seems so forlorn without them.''

 (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``This is the consequence, you see, Madam, of marrying a daughter,''  (<font color='red'><b>Elizabeth/Miss Bennet/Miss Elizabeth</b></font>)</div>said
Elizabeth. <div class="bookquote">``It must make you better satisfied that your other four are
single.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``It is no such thing. Lydia does not leave me because she (<font color='blue'><b>Lydia</b></font>) is married,
but only because her (<font color='blue'><b>Lydia</b></font>) husband's regiment happens to be so far off. If
that had been nearer, she (<font color='blue'><b>Lydia</b></font>) would not have gone so soon.''

 (<font color='red'><b>her</b></font>)</div><p/>But the spiritless condition which this event threw her (<font color='blue'><b>Elizabeth</b></font>) into was shortly
relieved, and her (<font color='blue'><b>Elizabeth</b></font>) mind opened again to the agitation of hope, by an
article of news which then began to be in circulation. The housekeeper
at Netherfield had received orders to prepare for the arrival of her (<font color='blue'><b>housekeeper</b></font>)
master, who was coming down in a day or two, to shoot there for several
weeks. Mrs. Bennet was quite in the fidgets. She (<font color='blue'><b>Bennet</b></font>) looked at Jane, and
smiled and shook her (<font color='blue'><b>Bennet</b></font>) head by turns.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Well, well, and so Mr. Bingley is coming down, sister,''  (<font color='red'><b>Mrs. Phillips/Phillips</b></font>)</div>-LRB-for Mrs.
Phillips first brought her (<font color='blue'><b>Phillips</b></font>) the news-RRB-. <div class="bookquote">``Well, so much the better. Not
that I care about it, though. He (<font color='blue'><b>Bingley</b></font>) is nothing to us, you know, and I am
sure _I_ never want to see him (<font color='blue'><b>Bingley</b></font>) again. But, however, he (<font color='blue'><b>Bingley</b></font>) is very welcome
to come to Netherfield, if he (<font color='blue'><b>Bingley</b></font>) likes it. And who knows what _may_ happen?
But that is nothing to us. You know, sister, we agreed long ago never to
mention a word about it. And so, is it quite certain he (<font color='blue'><b>Bingley</b></font>) is coming?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``You may depend on it,''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>replied the other, <div class="bookquote">``for Mrs. Nicholls was in
Meryton last night; I saw her (<font color='blue'><b>Nicholls</b></font>) passing by, and went out myself on purpose
to know the truth of it; and she (<font color='blue'><b>Nicholls</b></font>) told me that it was certain true. He (<font color='blue'><b>Bingley</b></font>)
comes down on Thursday at the latest, very likely on Wednesday. She (<font color='blue'><b>Nicholls</b></font>) was
going to the butcher's, she (<font color='blue'><b>Nicholls</b></font>) told me, on purpose to order in some meat on
Wednesday, and she (<font color='blue'><b>Nicholls</b></font>) has got three couple of ducks just fit to be killed.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Elizabeth/Miss Bennet/Miss Elizabeth</b></font>)</div><p/>Miss Bennet had not been able to hear of his (<font color='blue'><b>master</b></font>) coming without changing
colour. It was many months since she (<font color='blue'><b>Bennet</b></font>) had mentioned his (<font color='blue'><b>master</b></font>) name to
Elizabeth; but now, as soon as they were alone together, she (<font color='blue'><b>Elizabeth</b></font>) said:

<p/><div class="bookquote">``I saw you look at me to-day, Lizzy, when my aunt told us of the present
report; and I know I appeared distressed. But don't imagine it was from
any silly cause. I was only confused for the moment, because I felt that
I _should_ be looked at. I do assure you that the news does not affect
me either with pleasure or pain. I am glad of one thing, that he (<font color='blue'><b>Nicholls</b></font>) comes
alone; because we shall see the less of him (<font color='blue'><b>Nicholls</b></font>). Not that I am afraid of
_myself_, but I dread other people's remarks.''

 (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div><p/>Elizabeth did not know what to make of it. Had she (<font color='blue'><b>Elizabeth</b></font>) not seen him (<font color='blue'><b>master</b></font>) in
Derbyshire, she (<font color='blue'><b>Elizabeth</b></font>) might have supposed him (<font color='blue'><b>master</b></font>) capable of coming there with no
other view than what was acknowledged; but she (<font color='blue'><b>Elizabeth</b></font>) still thought him (<font color='blue'><b>master</b></font>) partial
to Jane, and she (<font color='blue'><b>Jane</b></font>) wavered as to the greater probability of his (<font color='blue'><b>master</b></font>) coming
there _with_ his (<font color='blue'><b>master</b></font>) friend's permission, or being bold enough to come
without it.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Yet it is hard,''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Jane</b></font>) sometimes thought, <div class="bookquote">``that this poor man cannot
come to a house which he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) has legally hired, without raising all this
speculation! I _will_ leave him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) to himself.''

 (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div><p/>In spite of what her (<font color='blue'><b>Jane</b></font>) sister declared, and really believed to be her (<font color='blue'><b>Jane</b></font>)
feelings in the expectation of his (<font color='blue'><b>master</b></font>) arrival, Elizabeth could easily
perceive that her (<font color='blue'><b>Elizabeth</b></font>) spirits were affected by it. They were more disturbed,
more unequal, than she (<font color='blue'><b>Elizabeth</b></font>) had often seen them.

<p/>The subject which had been so warmly canvassed between their parents,
about a twelvemonth ago, was now brought forward again.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``As soon as ever Mr. Bingley comes, my dear,''  (<font color='red'><b>Mrs. Bennet</b></font>)</div>said Mrs. Bennet, <div class="bookquote">``you
will wait on him (<font color='blue'><b>Bingley</b></font>) of course.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Mrs. Bennet</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``No, no. You forced me into visiting him (<font color='blue'><b>Bingley</b></font>) last year, and promised, if I
went to see him (<font color='blue'><b>Bingley</b></font>), he (<font color='blue'><b>Bingley</b></font>) should marry one of my daughters. But it ended in
nothing, and I will not be sent on a fool's errand again.''

 (<font color='red'><b>wife</b></font>)</div><p/>His (<font color='blue'><b>master</b></font>) wife represented to him (<font color='blue'><b>master</b></font>) how absolutely necessary such an attention
would be from all the neighbouring gentlemen, on his (<font color='blue'><b>master</b></font>) returning to
Netherfield.

<p/><div class="bookquote">''`Tis an etiquette I despise,''  (<font color='red'><b>all the gentlemen</b></font>)</div>said he (<font color='blue'><b>master</b></font>). <div class="bookquote">``If he (<font color='blue'><b>fool</b></font>) wants our society,
let him (<font color='blue'><b>fool</b></font>) seek it. He (<font color='blue'><b>fool</b></font>) knows where we live. I will not spend my hours
in running after my neighbours every time they go away and come back
again.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Well, all I know is, that it will be abominably rude if you do not wait
on him (<font color='blue'><b>fool</b></font>). But, however, that shan't prevent my asking him (<font color='blue'><b>fool</b></font>) to dine here, I
am determined. We must have Mrs. Long and the Gouldings soon. That will
make thirteen with ourselves, so there will be just room at table for
him (<font color='blue'><b>fool</b></font>).''

 (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div><p/>Consoled by this resolution, she (<font color='blue'><b>Bennet</b></font>) was the better able to bear her (<font color='blue'><b>Bennet</b></font>)
husband's incivility; though it was very mortifying to know that her (<font color='blue'><b>Bennet</b></font>)
neighbours might all see Mr. Bingley, in consequence of it, before
_they_ did. As the day of his (<font color='blue'><b>Bingley</b></font>) arrival drew near,--

<p/><div class="bookquote">``I begin to be sorry that he (<font color='blue'><b>fool</b></font>) comes at all,''  (<font color='red'><b>Jane</b></font>)</div>said Jane to her (<font color='blue'><b>Jane</b></font>) sister. <div class="bookquote">``It
would be nothing; I could see him (<font color='blue'><b>fool</b></font>) with perfect indifference, but I can
hardly bear to hear it thus perpetually talked of. My mother means well;
but she (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) does not know, no one can know, how much I suffer from what she (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>)
says. Happy shall I be, when his (<font color='blue'><b>fool</b></font>) stay at Netherfield is over!''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I wish I could say anything to comfort you,''  (<font color='red'><b>Elizabeth/Miss Bennet/Miss Elizabeth</b></font>)</div>replied Elizabeth; <div class="bookquote">``but it
is wholly out of my power. You must feel it; and the usual satisfaction
of preaching patience to a sufferer is denied me, because you have
always so much.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Elizabeth/Miss Bennet/Miss Elizabeth</b></font>)</div><p/>Mr. Bingley arrived. Mrs. Bennet, through the assistance of servants,
contrived to have the earliest tidings of it, that the period of anxiety
and fretfulness on her (<font color='blue'><b>Bennet</b></font>) side might be as long as it could. She (<font color='blue'><b>Bennet</b></font>) counted
the days that must intervene before their invitation could be sent;
hopeless of seeing him (<font color='blue'><b>Bingley</b></font>) before. But on the third morning after his (<font color='blue'><b>Bingley</b></font>)
arrival in Hertfordshire, she (<font color='blue'><b>Bennet</b></font>) saw him (<font color='blue'><b>Bingley</b></font>), from her (<font color='blue'><b>Bennet</b></font>) dressing-room window,
enter the paddock and ride towards the house.

<p/>Her (<font color='blue'><b>Bennet</b></font>) daughters were eagerly called to partake of her (<font color='blue'><b>Bennet</b></font>) joy. Jane resolutely
kept her (<font color='blue'><b>Jane</b></font>) place at the table; but Elizabeth, to satisfy her (<font color='blue'><b>Elizabeth</b></font>) mother, went
to the window--she (<font color='blue'><b>Elizabeth</b></font>) looked,--she (<font color='blue'><b>Elizabeth</b></font>) saw Mr. Darcy with him (<font color='blue'><b>Darcy</b></font>), and sat down
again by her (<font color='blue'><b>Elizabeth</b></font>) sister.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``There is a gentleman with him (<font color='blue'><b>gentleman</b></font>), mamma,''  (<font color='red'><b>Kitty</b></font>)</div>said Kitty; <div class="bookquote">``who can it be?''

 (<font color='red'><b>Kitty</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Some acquaintance or other, my dear, I suppose; I am sure I do not
know.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``La!''  (<font color='red'><b>Kitty</b></font>)</div>replied Kitty, <div class="bookquote">``it looks just like that man that used to be with
him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) before. Mr. what's-his-name. That tall, proud man.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Kitty</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Good gracious! Mr. Darcy!--and so it does, I vow. Well, any friend of
Mr. Bingley's will always be welcome here, to be sure; but else I must
say that I hate the very sight of him (<font color='blue'><b>Bingley</b></font>).''

 (<font color='red'><b>Jane</b></font>)</div><p/>Jane looked at Elizabeth with surprise and concern. She (<font color='blue'><b>Jane</b></font>) knew but little
of their meeting in Derbyshire, and therefore felt for the awkwardness
which must attend her (<font color='blue'><b>Jane</b></font>) sister, in seeing him (<font color='blue'><b>Darcy</b></font>) almost for the first time
after receiving his (<font color='blue'><b>Darcy</b></font>) explanatory letter. Both sisters were uncomfortable
enough. Each felt for the other, and of course for themselves; and their
mother talked on, of her (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) dislike of Mr. Darcy, and her (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) resolution to be
civil to him (<font color='blue'><b>Darcy</b></font>) only as Mr. Bingley's friend, without being heard by either
of them. But Elizabeth had sources of uneasiness which could not be
suspected by Jane, to whom she (<font color='blue'><b>Jane</b></font>) had never yet had courage to shew Mrs.
Gardiner's letter, or to relate her (<font color='blue'><b>Gardiner</b></font>) own change of sentiment towards him (<font color='blue'><b>Bingley</b></font>).
To Jane, he (<font color='blue'><b>Bingley</b></font>) could be only a man whose proposals she (<font color='blue'><b>Jane</b></font>) had refused,
and whose merit she (<font color='blue'><b>Jane</b></font>) had undervalued; but to her (<font color='blue'><b>Jane</b></font>) own more extensive
information, he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) was the person to whom the whole family were indebted
for the first of benefits, and whom she (<font color='blue'><b>Jane</b></font>) regarded herself with an
interest, if not quite so tender, at least as reasonable and just as
what Jane felt for Bingley. Her (<font color='blue'><b>Jane</b></font>) astonishment at his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) coming--at his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>)
coming to Netherfield, to Longbourn, and voluntarily seeking her (<font color='blue'><b>Jane</b></font>) again,
was almost equal to what she (<font color='blue'><b>Jane</b></font>) had known on first witnessing his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) altered
behaviour in Derbyshire.

<p/>The colour which had been driven from her (<font color='blue'><b>Jane</b></font>) face, returned for half a
minute with an additional glow, and a smile of delight added lustre to
her (<font color='blue'><b>Jane</b></font>) eyes, as she (<font color='blue'><b>Jane</b></font>) thought for that space of time that his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) affection and
wishes must still be unshaken. But she (<font color='blue'><b>Jane</b></font>) would not be secure.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Let me first see how he (<font color='blue'><b>Bingley</b></font>) behaves,''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>said she (<font color='blue'><b>Jane</b></font>); <div class="bookquote">``it will then be early
enough for expectation.''

 (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div><p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>Jane</b></font>) sat intently at work, striving to be composed, and without daring to
lift up her (<font color='blue'><b>Jane</b></font>) eyes, till anxious curiosity carried them to the face of
her (<font color='blue'><b>Jane</b></font>) sister as the servant was approaching the door. Jane looked a little
paler than usual, but more sedate than Elizabeth had expected. On the
gentlemen's appearing, her (<font color='blue'><b>Elizabeth</b></font>) colour increased; yet she (<font color='blue'><b>Elizabeth</b></font>) received them with
tolerable ease, and with a propriety of behaviour equally free from any
symptom of resentment or any unnecessary complaisance.

<p/>Elizabeth said as little to either as civility would allow, and sat down
again to her (<font color='blue'><b>Elizabeth</b></font>) work, with an eagerness which it did not often command. She (<font color='blue'><b>Elizabeth</b></font>)
had ventured only one glance at Darcy. He (<font color='blue'><b>Darcy</b></font>) looked serious, as usual; and,
she (<font color='blue'><b>Elizabeth</b></font>) thought, more as he (<font color='blue'><b>Darcy</b></font>) had been used to look in Hertfordshire, than as
she (<font color='blue'><b>Elizabeth</b></font>) had seen him (<font color='blue'><b>Darcy</b></font>) at Pemberley. But, perhaps he (<font color='blue'><b>Darcy</b></font>) could not in her (<font color='blue'><b>Elizabeth</b></font>) mother's
presence be what he (<font color='blue'><b>Darcy</b></font>) was before her (<font color='blue'><b>Elizabeth</b></font>) uncle and aunt. It was a painful, but
not an improbable, conjecture.

<p/>Bingley, she (<font color='blue'><b>Elizabeth</b></font>) had likewise seen for an instant, and in that short period
saw him (<font color='blue'><b>Bingley</b></font>) looking both pleased and embarrassed. He (<font color='blue'><b>Bingley</b></font>) was received by Mrs.
Bennet with a degree of civility which made her (<font color='blue'><b>Bennet</b></font>) two daughters ashamed,
especially when contrasted with the cold and ceremonious politeness of
her (<font color='blue'><b>Bennet</b></font>) curtsey and address to his (<font color='blue'><b>Bingley</b></font>) friend.

<p/>Elizabeth, particularly, who knew that her (<font color='blue'><b>Elizabeth</b></font>) mother owed to the latter
the preservation of her (<font color='blue'><b>Elizabeth</b></font>) favourite daughter from irremediable infamy,
was hurt and distressed to a most painful degree by a distinction so ill
applied.

<p/>Darcy, after inquiring of her (<font color='blue'><b>Elizabeth</b></font>) how Mr. and Mrs. Gardiner did, a question
which she (<font color='blue'><b>Gardiner</b></font>) could not answer without confusion, said scarcely anything. He (<font color='blue'><b>Darcy</b></font>)
was not seated by her (<font color='blue'><b>Gardiner</b></font>); perhaps that was the reason of his (<font color='blue'><b>Darcy</b></font>) silence; but
it had not been so in Derbyshire. There he (<font color='blue'><b>Darcy</b></font>) had talked to her (<font color='blue'><b>Gardiner</b></font>) friends,
when he (<font color='blue'><b>Darcy</b></font>) could not to herself. But now several minutes elapsed without
bringing the sound of his (<font color='blue'><b>Darcy</b></font>) voice; and when occasionally, unable to resist
the impulse of curiosity, she (<font color='blue'><b>Gardiner</b></font>) raised her (<font color='blue'><b>Gardiner</b></font>) eyes to his (<font color='blue'><b>Darcy</b></font>) face, she (<font color='blue'><b>Gardiner</b></font>) as often
found him (<font color='blue'><b>Darcy</b></font>) looking at Jane as at herself, and frequently on no object but
the ground. More thoughtfulness and less anxiety to please, than when
they last met, were plainly expressed. She (<font color='blue'><b>Jane</b></font>) was disappointed, and angry
with herself for being so.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Could I expect it to be otherwise!''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>said she (<font color='blue'><b>Jane</b></font>). <div class="bookquote">``Yet why did he (<font color='blue'><b>Bingley</b></font>) come?''

 (<font color='red'><b>She</b></font>)</div><p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>Jane</b></font>) was in no humour for conversation with anyone but himself; and to
him (<font color='blue'><b>Darcy</b></font>) she (<font color='blue'><b>Jane</b></font>) had hardly courage to speak.

<p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>Jane</b></font>) inquired after his (<font color='blue'><b>Darcy</b></font>) sister, but could do no more.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``It is a long time, Mr. Bingley, since you went away,''  (<font color='red'><b>Mrs. Bennet</b></font>)</div>said Mrs. Bennet.

<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Darcy</b></font>) readily agreed to it.

<p/>``I began to be afraid you would never come back again. People _did_ say
you meant to quit the place entirely at Michaelmas; but, however, I hope
it is not true. A great many changes have happened in the neighbourhood,
since you went away. Miss Lucas is married and settled. And one of my
own daughters. I suppose you have heard of it; indeed, you must have
seen it in the papers. It was in The Times and The Courier, I know;
though it was not put in as it ought to be. It was only said, ``Lately,
George Wickham, Esq. to Miss Lydia Bennet,<div class="bookquote">'' without there being a
syllable said of her (<font color='blue'><b>Bennet</b></font>) father, or the place where she (<font color='blue'><b>Bennet</b></font>) lived, or anything.
It was my brother Gardiner's drawing up too, and I wonder how he (<font color='blue'><b>brother</b></font>) came to
make such an awkward business of it. Did you see it?''

 (<font color='red'><b>Lydia/Miss Lydia/Miss Lydia Bennet</b></font>)</div><p/>Bingley replied that he (<font color='blue'><b>Bingley</b></font>) did, and made his (<font color='blue'><b>Bingley</b></font>) congratulations. Elizabeth
dared not lift up her (<font color='blue'><b>Elizabeth</b></font>) eyes. How Mr. Darcy looked, therefore, she (<font color='blue'><b>Elizabeth</b></font>) could
not tell.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``It is a delightful thing, to be sure, to have a daughter well married,''
 (<font color='red'><b>mother</b></font>)</div>continued her (<font color='blue'><b>Elizabeth</b></font>) mother, <div class="bookquote">``but at the same time, Mr. Bingley, it is very
hard to have her (<font color='blue'><b>daughter</b></font>) taken such a way from me. They are gone down to
Newcastle, a place quite northward, it seems, and there they are to stay
I do not know how long. His (<font color='blue'><b>Bingley</b></font>) regiment is there; for I suppose you have
heard of his (<font color='blue'><b>Bingley</b></font>) leaving the --shire, and of his (<font color='blue'><b>Bingley</b></font>) being gone into the
regulars. Thank Heaven! he (<font color='blue'><b>Bingley</b></font>) has _some_ friends, though perhaps not so
many as he (<font color='blue'><b>Bingley</b></font>) deserves.''

 (<font color='red'><b>mother</b></font>)</div><p/>Elizabeth, who knew this to be levelled at Mr. Darcy, was in such
misery of shame, that she (<font color='blue'><b>Elizabeth</b></font>) could hardly keep her (<font color='blue'><b>Elizabeth</b></font>) seat. It drew from her (<font color='blue'><b>Elizabeth</b></font>),
however, the exertion of speaking, which nothing else had so effectually
done before; and she (<font color='blue'><b>Elizabeth</b></font>) asked Bingley whether he (<font color='blue'><b>Bingley</b></font>) meant to make any stay in
the country at present. A few weeks, he (<font color='blue'><b>Bingley</b></font>) believed.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``When you have killed all your own birds, Mr. Bingley,''  (<font color='red'><b>mother</b></font>)</div>said her (<font color='blue'><b>Elizabeth</b></font>) mother,
<div class="bookquote">``I beg you will come here, and shoot as many as you please on Mr.
Bennet's manor. I am sure he (<font color='blue'><b>Bennet</b></font>) will be vastly happy to oblige you, and
will save all the best of the covies for you.''

 (<font color='red'><b>mother</b></font>)</div><p/>Elizabeth's misery increased, at such unnecessary, such officious
attention! Were the same fair prospect to arise at present as had
flattered them a year ago, every thing, she (<font color='blue'><b>Elizabeth</b></font>) was persuaded, would be
hastening to the same vexatious conclusion. At that instant, she (<font color='blue'><b>Elizabeth</b></font>) felt
that years of happiness could not make Jane or herself amends for
moments of such painful confusion.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``The first wish of my heart,''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>said she (<font color='blue'><b>Jane</b></font>) to herself, <div class="bookquote">``is never more to
be in company with either of them. Their society can afford no pleasure
that will atone for such wretchedness as this! Let me never see either
one or the other again!''

 (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div><p/>Yet the misery, for which years of happiness were to offer no
compensation, received soon afterwards material relief, from observing
how much the beauty of her (<font color='blue'><b>Jane</b></font>) sister re-kindled the admiration of her (<font color='blue'><b>Jane</b></font>)
former lover. When first he (<font color='blue'><b>lover</b></font>) came in, he (<font color='blue'><b>lover</b></font>) had spoken to her (<font color='blue'><b>Jane</b></font>) but little;
but every five minutes seemed to be giving her (<font color='blue'><b>Jane</b></font>) more of his (<font color='blue'><b>lover</b></font>) attention. He (<font color='blue'><b>lover</b></font>)
found her (<font color='blue'><b>Jane</b></font>) as handsome as she (<font color='blue'><b>Jane</b></font>) had been last year; as good natured, and
as unaffected, though not quite so chatty. Jane was anxious that no
difference should be perceived in her (<font color='blue'><b>Jane</b></font>) at all, and was really persuaded
that she (<font color='blue'><b>Jane</b></font>) talked as much as ever. But her (<font color='blue'><b>Jane</b></font>) mind was so busily engaged,
that she (<font color='blue'><b>Jane</b></font>) did not always know when she (<font color='blue'><b>Jane</b></font>) was silent.

<p/>When the gentlemen rose to go away, Mrs. Bennet was mindful of her (<font color='blue'><b>Bennet</b></font>)
intended civility, and they were invited and engaged to dine at
Longbourn in a few days time.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``You are quite a visit in my debt, Mr. Bingley,''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Bennet</b></font>) added, <div class="bookquote">``for when
you went to town last winter, you promised to take a family dinner with
us, as soon as you returned. I have not forgot, you see; and I assure
you, I was very much disappointed that you did not come back and keep
your engagement.''

 (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div><p/>Bingley looked a little silly at this reflection, and said something of
his (<font color='blue'><b>Bingley</b></font>) concern at having been prevented by business. They then went away.

<p/>Mrs. Bennet had been strongly inclined to ask them to stay and dine
there that day; but, though she (<font color='blue'><b>Bennet</b></font>) always kept a very good table, she (<font color='blue'><b>Bennet</b></font>) did
not think anything less than two courses could be good enough for a man
on whom she (<font color='blue'><b>Bennet</b></font>) had such anxious designs, or satisfy the appetite and pride
of one who had ten thousand a year.



<p/>Chapter 54


<p/>As soon as they were gone, Elizabeth walked out to recover her (<font color='blue'><b>Elizabeth</b></font>) spirits;
or in other words, to dwell without interruption on those subjects that
must deaden them more. Mr. Darcy's behaviour astonished and vexed her (<font color='blue'><b>Elizabeth</b></font>).

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Why, if he (<font color='blue'><b>Bingley</b></font>) came only to be silent, grave, and indifferent,''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>said she (<font color='blue'><b>Elizabeth</b></font>),
<div class="bookquote">``did he (<font color='blue'><b>Bingley</b></font>) come at all?''

 (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div><p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>Elizabeth</b></font>) could settle it in no way that gave her (<font color='blue'><b>Elizabeth</b></font>) pleasure.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``He (<font color='blue'><b>Bingley</b></font>) could be still amiable, still pleasing, to my uncle and aunt, when
he (<font color='blue'><b>Bingley</b></font>) was in town; and why not to me? If he (<font color='blue'><b>Bingley</b></font>) fears me, why come hither? If
he (<font color='blue'><b>Bingley</b></font>) no longer cares for me, why silent? Teasing, teasing, man! I will
think no more about him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>).''

 (<font color='red'><b>sister</b></font>)</div><p/>Her (<font color='blue'><b>Elizabeth</b></font>) resolution was for a short time involuntarily kept by the approach
of her (<font color='blue'><b>Elizabeth</b></font>) sister, who joined her (<font color='blue'><b>Elizabeth</b></font>) with a cheerful look, which showed her (<font color='blue'><b>Elizabeth</b></font>)
better satisfied with their visitors, than Elizabeth.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Now,''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>said she (<font color='blue'><b>Elizabeth</b></font>), <div class="bookquote">``that this first meeting is over, I feel perfectly
easy. I know my own strength, and I shall never be embarrassed again by
his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) coming. I am glad he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) dines here on Tuesday. It will then be publicly
seen that, on both sides, we meet only as common and indifferent
acquaintance.''

 (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Yes, very indifferent indeed,''  (<font color='red'><b>Elizabeth/Miss Bennet/Miss Elizabeth</b></font>)</div>said Elizabeth, laughingly. <div class="bookquote">``Oh, Jane,
take care.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``My dear Lizzy, you cannot think me so weak, as to be in danger now?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I think you are in very great danger of making him (<font color='blue'><b>acquaintance</b></font>) as much in love with
you as ever.''

 (<font color='red'><b>the gentlemen</b></font>)</div><p/>* * * * *

<p/>They did not see the gentlemen again till Tuesday; and Mrs. Bennet, in
the meanwhile, was giving way to all the happy schemes, which the good
humour and common politeness of Bingley, in half an hour's visit, had
revived.

<p/>On Tuesday there was a large party assembled at Longbourn; and the two
who were most anxiously expected, to the credit of their punctuality
as sportsmen, were in very good time. When they repaired to the
dining-room, Elizabeth eagerly watched to see whether Bingley would take
the place, which, in all their former parties, had belonged to him (<font color='blue'><b>Bingley</b></font>), by
her (<font color='blue'><b>Elizabeth</b></font>) sister. Her (<font color='blue'><b>Elizabeth</b></font>) prudent mother, occupied by the same ideas, forbore
to invite him (<font color='blue'><b>Bingley</b></font>) to sit by herself. On entering the room, he (<font color='blue'><b>Bingley</b></font>) seemed to
hesitate; but Jane happened to look round, and happened to smile: it was
decided. He (<font color='blue'><b>Bingley</b></font>) placed himself by her (<font color='blue'><b>Jane</b></font>).

<p/>Elizabeth, with a triumphant sensation, looked towards his (<font color='blue'><b>Bingley</b></font>) friend.
He (<font color='blue'><b>Bingley</b></font>) bore it with noble indifference, and she (<font color='blue'><b>Elizabeth</b></font>) would have imagined that
Bingley had received his (<font color='blue'><b>Bingley</b></font>) sanction to be happy, had she (<font color='blue'><b>Elizabeth</b></font>) not seen his (<font color='blue'><b>Bingley</b></font>) eyes
likewise turned towards Mr. Darcy, with an expression of half-laughing
alarm.

<p/>His (<font color='blue'><b>Bingley</b></font>) behaviour to her (<font color='blue'><b>Elizabeth</b></font>) sister was such, during dinner time, as showed an
admiration of her (<font color='blue'><b>Elizabeth</b></font>), which, though more guarded than formerly, persuaded
Elizabeth, that if left wholly to himself, Jane's happiness, and his (<font color='blue'><b>Bingley</b></font>)
own, would be speedily secured. Though she (<font color='blue'><b>Elizabeth</b></font>) dared not depend upon the
consequence, she (<font color='blue'><b>Elizabeth</b></font>) yet received pleasure from observing his (<font color='blue'><b>Bingley</b></font>) behaviour. It
gave her (<font color='blue'><b>Elizabeth</b></font>) all the animation that her (<font color='blue'><b>Elizabeth</b></font>) spirits could boast; for she (<font color='blue'><b>Elizabeth</b></font>) was in
no cheerful humour. Mr. Darcy was almost as far from her (<font color='blue'><b>Elizabeth</b></font>) as the table
could divide them. He (<font color='blue'><b>Darcy</b></font>) was on one side of her (<font color='blue'><b>Elizabeth</b></font>) mother. She (<font color='blue'><b>Elizabeth</b></font>) knew how little
such a situation would give pleasure to either, or make either appear to
advantage. She (<font color='blue'><b>Elizabeth</b></font>) was not near enough to hear any of their discourse, but
she (<font color='blue'><b>Elizabeth</b></font>) could see how seldom they spoke to each other, and how formal and
cold was their manner whenever they did. Her (<font color='blue'><b>Elizabeth</b></font>) mother's ungraciousness,
made the sense of what they owed him (<font color='blue'><b>Darcy</b></font>) more painful to Elizabeth's mind;
and she (<font color='blue'><b>Elizabeth</b></font>) would, at times, have given anything to be privileged to tell
him (<font color='blue'><b>Darcy</b></font>) that his (<font color='blue'><b>Darcy</b></font>) kindness was neither unknown nor unfelt by the whole of the
family.

<p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>Elizabeth</b></font>) was in hopes that the evening would afford some opportunity of
bringing them together; that the whole of the visit would not pass away
without enabling them to enter into something more of conversation than
the mere ceremonious salutation attending his (<font color='blue'><b>Darcy</b></font>) entrance. Anxious
and uneasy, the period which passed in the drawing-room, before the
gentlemen came, was wearisome and dull to a degree that almost made her (<font color='blue'><b>Elizabeth</b></font>)
uncivil. She (<font color='blue'><b>Elizabeth</b></font>) looked forward to their entrance as the point on which all
her (<font color='blue'><b>Elizabeth</b></font>) chance of pleasure for the evening must depend.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``If he (<font color='blue'><b>acquaintance</b></font>) does not come to me, _then_,''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>said she (<font color='blue'><b>Elizabeth</b></font>), <div class="bookquote">``I shall give him (<font color='blue'><b>acquaintance</b></font>) up for
ever.''

 (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div><p/>The gentlemen came; and she (<font color='blue'><b>Elizabeth</b></font>) thought he (<font color='blue'><b>Darcy</b></font>) looked as if he (<font color='blue'><b>Darcy</b></font>) would have
answered her (<font color='blue'><b>Elizabeth</b></font>) hopes; but, alas! the ladies had crowded round the table,
where Miss Bennet was making tea, and Elizabeth pouring out the coffee,
in so close a confederacy that there was not a single vacancy near her (<font color='blue'><b>Elizabeth</b></font>)
which would admit of a chair. And on the gentlemen's approaching, one of
the girls moved closer to her (<font color='blue'><b>Elizabeth</b></font>) than ever, and said, in a whisper:

<p/><div class="bookquote">``The men shan't come and part us, I am determined. We want none of them;
do we?''

 (<font color='red'><b>the girls</b></font>)</div><p/>Darcy had walked away to another part of the room. She (<font color='blue'><b>Elizabeth</b></font>) followed him (<font color='blue'><b>Darcy</b></font>) with
her (<font color='blue'><b>Elizabeth</b></font>) eyes, envied everyone to whom he (<font color='blue'><b>Darcy</b></font>) spoke, had scarcely patience enough
to help anybody to coffee; and then was enraged against herself for
being so silly!

<p/><div class="bookquote">``A man who has once been refused! How could I ever be foolish enough to
expect a renewal of his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) love? Is there one among the sex, who would not
protest against such a weakness as a second proposal to the same woman?
There is no indignity so abhorrent to their feelings!''

 (<font color='red'><b>She</b></font>)</div><p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>Elizabeth</b></font>) was a little revived, however, by his (<font color='blue'><b>Darcy</b></font>) bringing back his (<font color='blue'><b>Darcy</b></font>) coffee cup
himself; and she (<font color='blue'><b>Elizabeth</b></font>) seized the opportunity of saying:

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Is your sister at Pemberley still?''

 (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Yes, she (<font color='blue'><b>sister</b></font>) will remain there till Christmas.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``And quite alone? Have all her (<font color='blue'><b>sister</b></font>) friends left her (<font color='blue'><b>sister</b></font>)?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Mrs. Annesley is with her (<font color='blue'><b>Annesley</b></font>). The others have been gone on to Scarborough,
these three weeks.''

 (<font color='red'><b>She</b></font>)</div><p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>Elizabeth</b></font>) could think of nothing more to say; but if he (<font color='blue'><b>Darcy</b></font>) wished to converse
with her (<font color='blue'><b>Elizabeth</b></font>), he (<font color='blue'><b>Darcy</b></font>) might have better success. He (<font color='blue'><b>Darcy</b></font>) stood by her (<font color='blue'><b>Elizabeth</b></font>), however, for
some minutes, in silence; and, at last, on the young lady's whispering
to Elizabeth again, he (<font color='blue'><b>Darcy</b></font>) walked away.

<p/>When the tea-things were removed, and the card-tables placed, the ladies
all rose, and Elizabeth was then hoping to be soon joined by him (<font color='blue'><b>Darcy</b></font>),
when all her (<font color='blue'><b>Elizabeth</b></font>) views were overthrown by seeing him (<font color='blue'><b>Darcy</b></font>) fall a victim to her (<font color='blue'><b>Elizabeth</b></font>)
mother's rapacity for whist players, and in a few moments after seated
with the rest of the party. She (<font color='blue'><b>Elizabeth</b></font>) now lost every expectation of pleasure.
They were confined for the evening at different tables, and she (<font color='blue'><b>Elizabeth</b></font>) had
nothing to hope, but that his (<font color='blue'><b>Darcy</b></font>) eyes were so often turned towards her (<font color='blue'><b>Elizabeth</b></font>) side
of the room, as to make him (<font color='blue'><b>Darcy</b></font>) play as unsuccessfully as herself.

<p/>Mrs. Bennet had designed to keep the two Netherfield gentlemen to
supper; but their carriage was unluckily ordered before any of the
others, and she (<font color='blue'><b>Bennet</b></font>) had no opportunity of detaining them.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Well girls,''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>said she (<font color='blue'><b>Bennet</b></font>), as soon as they were left to themselves, ``What
say you to the day? I think every thing has passed off uncommonly well,
I assure you. The dinner was as well dressed as any I ever saw. The
venison was roasted to a turn--and everybody said they never saw so
fat a haunch. The soup was fifty times better than what we had at the
Lucases' last week; and even Mr. Darcy acknowledged, that the partridges
were remarkably well done; and I suppose he (<font color='blue'><b>Darcy</b></font>) has two or three French
cooks at least. And, my dear Jane, I never saw you look in greater
beauty. Mrs. Long said so too, for I asked her (<font color='blue'><b>Long</b></font>) whether you did not. And
what do you think she (<font color='blue'><b>Long</b></font>) said besides? ``Ah! Mrs. Bennet, we shall have her (<font color='blue'><b>Bennet</b></font>)
at Netherfield at last.<div class="bookquote">'' She (<font color='blue'><b>Bennet</b></font>) did indeed. I do think Mrs. Long is as good
a creature as ever lived--and her (<font color='blue'><b>Long</b></font>) nieces are very pretty behaved girls,
and not at all handsome: I like them prodigiously.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Mrs. Bennet</b></font>)</div><p/>Mrs. Bennet, in short, was in very great spirits; she (<font color='blue'><b>Bennet</b></font>) had seen enough of
Bingley's behaviour to Jane, to be convinced that she (<font color='blue'><b>Jane</b></font>) would get him (<font color='blue'><b>Bingley</b></font>) at
last; and her (<font color='blue'><b>Jane</b></font>) expectations of advantage to her (<font color='blue'><b>Jane</b></font>) family, when in a happy
humour, were so far beyond reason, that she (<font color='blue'><b>Jane</b></font>) was quite disappointed at
not seeing him (<font color='blue'><b>Bingley</b></font>) there again the next day, to make his (<font color='blue'><b>Bingley</b></font>) proposals.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``It has been a very agreeable day,''  (<font color='red'><b>Elizabeth/Miss Bennet/Miss Elizabeth</b></font>)</div>said Miss Bennet to Elizabeth. <div class="bookquote">``The
party seemed so well selected, so suitable one with the other. I hope we
may often meet again.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Elizabeth/Miss Bennet/Miss Elizabeth</b></font>)</div><p/>Elizabeth smiled.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Lizzy, you must not do so. You must not suspect me. It mortifies me.
I assure you that I have now learnt to enjoy his (<font color='blue'><b>Long</b></font>) conversation as an
agreeable and sensible young man, without having a wish beyond it. I am
perfectly satisfied, from what his (<font color='blue'><b>Long</b></font>) manners now are, that he (<font color='blue'><b>Long</b></font>) never had
any design of engaging my affection. It is only that he (<font color='blue'><b>Long</b></font>) is blessed
with greater sweetness of address, and a stronger desire of generally
pleasing, than any other man.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``You are very cruel,''  (<font color='red'><b>sister</b></font>)</div>said her (<font color='blue'><b>Elizabeth</b></font>) sister, <div class="bookquote">``you will not let me smile, and
are provoking me to it every moment.''

 (<font color='red'><b>sister</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``How hard it is in some cases to be believed!''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``And how impossible in others!''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``But why should you wish to persuade me that I feel more than I
acknowledge?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``That is a question which I hardly know how to answer. We all love to
instruct, though we can teach only what is not worth knowing. Forgive
me; and if you persist in indifference, do not make me your confidante.''



 (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Bingley/Bingley</b></font>)</div><p/>Chapter 55


<p/>A few days after this visit, Mr. Bingley called again, and alone. His (<font color='blue'><b>Bingley</b></font>)
friend had left him (<font color='blue'><b>Bingley</b></font>) that morning for London, but was to return home in
ten days time. He (<font color='blue'><b>Bingley</b></font>) sat with them above an hour, and was in remarkably
good spirits. Mrs. Bennet invited him (<font color='blue'><b>Bingley</b></font>) to dine with them; but, with many
expressions of concern, he (<font color='blue'><b>Bingley</b></font>) confessed himself engaged elsewhere.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Next time you call,''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>said she (<font color='blue'><b>Bennet</b></font>), <div class="bookquote">``I hope we shall be more lucky.''

 (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div><p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Bingley</b></font>) should be particularly happy at any time, etc. etc.; and if she (<font color='blue'><b>Bennet</b></font>) would
give him (<font color='blue'><b>Bingley</b></font>) leave, would take an early opportunity of waiting on them.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Can you come to-morrow?''

 (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div><p/>Yes, he (<font color='blue'><b>Bingley</b></font>) had no engagement at all for to-morrow; and her (<font color='blue'><b>Bennet</b></font>) invitation was
accepted with alacrity.

<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Bingley</b></font>) came, and in such very good time that the ladies were none of them
dressed. In ran Mrs. Bennet to her (<font color='blue'><b>Bennet</b></font>) daughter's room, in her (<font color='blue'><b>Bennet</b></font>) dressing
gown, and with her (<font color='blue'><b>Bennet</b></font>) hair half finished, crying out:

<p/><div class="bookquote">``My dear Jane, make haste and hurry down. He (<font color='blue'><b>confidante</b></font>) is come--Mr. Bingley is
come. He (<font color='blue'><b>Bingley</b></font>) is, indeed. Make haste, make haste. Here, Sarah, come to Miss
Bennet this moment, and help her (<font color='blue'><b>Bennet</b></font>) on with her (<font color='blue'><b>Bennet</b></font>) gown. Never mind Miss
Lizzy's hair.''

 (<font color='red'><b>daughter</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``We will be down as soon as we can,''  (<font color='red'><b>Jane</b></font>)</div>said Jane; <div class="bookquote">``but I dare say Kitty is
forwarder than either of us, for she (<font color='blue'><b>Kitty</b></font>) went up stairs half an hour ago.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Jane</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Oh! hang Kitty! what has she (<font color='blue'><b>Kitty</b></font>) to do with it? Come be quick, be quick!
Where is your sash, my dear?''

 (<font color='red'><b>mother</b></font>)</div><p/>But when her (<font color='blue'><b>Jane</b></font>) mother was gone, Jane would not be prevailed on to go down
without one of her (<font color='blue'><b>Jane</b></font>) sisters.

<p/>The same anxiety to get them by themselves was visible again in the
evening. After tea, Mr. Bennet retired to the library, as was his (<font color='blue'><b>Bennet</b></font>)
custom, and Mary went up stairs to her (<font color='blue'><b>Mary</b></font>) instrument. Two obstacles of
the five being thus removed, Mrs. Bennet sat looking and winking at
Elizabeth and Catherine for a considerable time, without making any
impression on them. Elizabeth would not observe her (<font color='blue'><b>Elizabeth</b></font>); and when at last
Kitty did, she (<font color='blue'><b>Kitty</b></font>) very innocently said, <div class="bookquote">``What is the matter mamma? What do
you keep winking at me for? What am I to do?''

 (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Nothing child, nothing. I did not wink at you.''  (<font color='red'><b>She</b></font>)</div>She (<font color='blue'><b>Kitty</b></font>) then sat still
five minutes longer; but unable to waste such a precious occasion, she (<font color='blue'><b>Kitty</b></font>)
suddenly got up, and saying to Kitty, <div class="bookquote">``Come here, my love, I want to
speak to you,''  (<font color='red'><b>Kitty</b></font>)</div>took her (<font color='blue'><b>Kitty</b></font>) out of the room. Jane instantly gave a look
at Elizabeth which spoke her (<font color='blue'><b>Jane</b></font>) distress at such premeditation, and her (<font color='blue'><b>Jane</b></font>)
entreaty that _she (<font color='blue'><b>Jane</b></font>)_ would not give in to it. In a few minutes, Mrs.
Bennet half-opened the door and called out:

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Lizzy, my dear, I want to speak with you.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Mrs. Bennet</b></font>)</div><p/>Elizabeth was forced to go.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``We may as well leave them by themselves you know;''  (<font color='red'><b>mother</b></font>)</div>said her (<font color='blue'><b>Elizabeth</b></font>) mother, as
soon as she (<font color='blue'><b>Elizabeth</b></font>) was in the hall. <div class="bookquote">``Kitty and I are going up stairs to sit in
my dressing-room.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Elizabeth/Miss Bennet/Miss Elizabeth</b></font>)</div><p/>Elizabeth made no attempt to reason with her (<font color='blue'><b>Elizabeth</b></font>) mother, but remained
quietly in the hall, till she (<font color='blue'><b>Elizabeth</b></font>) and Kitty were out of sight, then returned
into the drawing-room.

<p/>Mrs. Bennet's schemes for this day were ineffectual. Bingley was every
thing that was charming, except the professed lover of her (<font color='blue'><b>Bennet</b></font>) daughter. His (<font color='blue'><b>Bingley</b></font>)
ease and cheerfulness rendered him (<font color='blue'><b>Bingley</b></font>) a most agreeable addition to their
evening party; and he (<font color='blue'><b>Bingley</b></font>) bore with the ill-judged officiousness of the
mother, and heard all her (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) silly remarks with a forbearance and command
of countenance particularly grateful to the daughter.

<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Bingley</b></font>) scarcely needed an invitation to stay supper; and before he (<font color='blue'><b>Bingley</b></font>) went
away, an engagement was formed, chiefly through his (<font color='blue'><b>Bingley</b></font>) own and Mrs.
Bennet's means, for his (<font color='blue'><b>Bingley</b></font>) coming next morning to shoot with her (<font color='blue'><b>Bennet</b></font>) husband.

<p/>After this day, Jane said no more of her (<font color='blue'><b>Jane</b></font>) indifference. Not a word passed
between the sisters concerning Bingley; but Elizabeth went to bed in
the happy belief that all must speedily be concluded, unless Mr. Darcy
returned within the stated time. Seriously, however, she (<font color='blue'><b>Elizabeth</b></font>) felt tolerably
persuaded that all this must have taken place with that gentleman's
concurrence.

<p/>Bingley was punctual to his (<font color='blue'><b>Bingley</b></font>) appointment; and he (<font color='blue'><b>Bingley</b></font>) and Mr. Bennet spent
the morning together, as had been agreed on. The latter was much more
agreeable than his (<font color='blue'><b>Bennet</b></font>) companion expected. There was nothing of presumption
or folly in Bingley that could provoke his (<font color='blue'><b>Bennet</b></font>) ridicule, or disgust him (<font color='blue'><b>Bennet</b></font>) into
silence; and he (<font color='blue'><b>Bennet</b></font>) was more communicative, and less eccentric, than the
other had ever seen him (<font color='blue'><b>Bennet</b></font>). Bingley of course returned with him (<font color='blue'><b>Bingley</b></font>) to dinner;
and in the evening Mrs. Bennet's invention was again at work to get
every body away from him (<font color='blue'><b>Bingley</b></font>) and her (<font color='blue'><b>Bennet</b></font>) daughter. Elizabeth, who had a letter
to write, went into the breakfast room for that purpose soon after tea;
for as the others were all going to sit down to cards, she (<font color='blue'><b>Elizabeth</b></font>) could not be
wanted to counteract her (<font color='blue'><b>Elizabeth</b></font>) mother's schemes.

<p/>But on returning to the drawing-room, when her (<font color='blue'><b>Elizabeth</b></font>) letter was finished, she (<font color='blue'><b>Elizabeth</b></font>)
saw, to her (<font color='blue'><b>Elizabeth</b></font>) infinite surprise, there was reason to fear that her (<font color='blue'><b>Elizabeth</b></font>) mother
had been too ingenious for her (<font color='blue'><b>Elizabeth</b></font>). On opening the door, she (<font color='blue'><b>Elizabeth</b></font>) perceived her (<font color='blue'><b>Elizabeth</b></font>)
sister and Bingley standing together over the hearth, as if engaged in
earnest conversation; and had this led to no suspicion, the faces of
both, as they hastily turned round and moved away from each other, would
have told it all. Their situation was awkward enough; but _hers_ she (<font color='blue'><b>Elizabeth</b></font>)
thought was still worse. Not a syllable was uttered by either; and
Elizabeth was on the point of going away again, when Bingley, who as
well as the other had sat down, suddenly rose, and whispering a few
words to her (<font color='blue'><b>Elizabeth</b></font>) sister, ran out of the room.

<p/>Jane could have no reserves from Elizabeth, where confidence would give
pleasure; and instantly embracing her (<font color='blue'><b>Elizabeth</b></font>), acknowledged, with the liveliest
emotion, that she (<font color='blue'><b>Elizabeth</b></font>) was the happiest creature in the world.

<p/><div class="bookquote">''`Tis too much!''  (<font color='red'><b>the creature</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Elizabeth</b></font>) added, <div class="bookquote">``by far too much. I do not deserve it. Oh!
why is not everybody as happy?''

 (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div><p/>Elizabeth's congratulations were given with a sincerity, a warmth,
a delight, which words could but poorly express. Every sentence of
kindness was a fresh source of happiness to Jane. But she (<font color='blue'><b>Jane</b></font>) would not
allow herself to stay with her (<font color='blue'><b>Jane</b></font>) sister, or say half that remained to be
said for the present.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``I must go instantly to my mother;''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Jane</b></font>) cried. <div class="bookquote">``I would not on any
account trifle with her (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) affectionate solicitude; or allow her (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) to hear it
from anyone but myself. He (<font color='blue'><b>anyone</b></font>) is gone to my father already. Oh! Lizzy, to
know that what I have to relate will give such pleasure to all my dear
family! how shall I bear so much happiness!''

 (<font color='red'><b>She</b></font>)</div><p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>Jane</b></font>) then hastened away to her (<font color='blue'><b>Jane</b></font>) mother, who had purposely broken up the
card party, and was sitting up stairs with Kitty.

<p/>Elizabeth, who was left by herself, now smiled at the rapidity and ease
with which an affair was finally settled, that had given them so many
previous months of suspense and vexation.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``And this,''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>said she (<font color='blue'><b>Elizabeth</b></font>), <div class="bookquote">``is the end of all his (<font color='blue'><b>anyone</b></font>) friend's anxious
circumspection! of all his (<font color='blue'><b>anyone</b></font>) sister's falsehood and contrivance! the
happiest, wisest, most reasonable end!''

 (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div><p/>In a few minutes she (<font color='blue'><b>Elizabeth</b></font>) was joined by Bingley, whose conference with her (<font color='blue'><b>Elizabeth</b></font>)
father had been short and to the purpose.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Where is your sister?''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>said he (<font color='blue'><b>Bingley</b></font>) hastily, as he (<font color='blue'><b>Bingley</b></font>) opened the door.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``With my mother up stairs. She (<font color='blue'><b>sister</b></font>) will be down in a moment, I dare say.''

 (<font color='red'><b>He</b></font>)</div><p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Bingley</b></font>) then shut the door, and, coming up to her (<font color='blue'><b>Elizabeth</b></font>), claimed the good wishes
and affection of a sister. Elizabeth honestly and heartily expressed
her (<font color='blue'><b>Elizabeth</b></font>) delight in the prospect of their relationship. They shook hands with
great cordiality; and then, till her (<font color='blue'><b>Elizabeth</b></font>) sister came down, she (<font color='blue'><b>Elizabeth</b></font>) had to listen
to all he (<font color='blue'><b>Bingley</b></font>) had to say of his (<font color='blue'><b>Bingley</b></font>) own happiness, and of Jane's perfections;
and in spite of his (<font color='blue'><b>Bingley</b></font>) being a lover, Elizabeth really believed all his (<font color='blue'><b>Bingley</b></font>)
expectations of felicity to be rationally founded, because they had for
basis the excellent understanding, and super-excellent disposition of
Jane, and a general similarity of feeling and taste between her (<font color='blue'><b>Jane</b></font>) and
himself.

<p/>It was an evening of no common delight to them all; the satisfaction of
Miss Bennet's mind gave a glow of such sweet animation to her (<font color='blue'><b>Bennet</b></font>) face, as
made her (<font color='blue'><b>Bennet</b></font>) look handsomer than ever. Kitty simpered and smiled, and hoped
her (<font color='blue'><b>Bennet</b></font>) turn was coming soon. Mrs. Bennet could not give her (<font color='blue'><b>Bennet</b></font>) consent or
speak her (<font color='blue'><b>Bennet</b></font>) approbation in terms warm enough to satisfy her (<font color='blue'><b>Bennet</b></font>) feelings,
though she (<font color='blue'><b>Bennet</b></font>) talked to Bingley of nothing else for half an hour; and when
Mr. Bennet joined them at supper, his (<font color='blue'><b>Bennet</b></font>) voice and manner plainly showed
how really happy he (<font color='blue'><b>Bennet</b></font>) was.

<p/>Not a word, however, passed his (<font color='blue'><b>Bennet</b></font>) lips in allusion to it, till their
visitor took his (<font color='blue'><b>Bennet</b></font>) leave for the night; but as soon as he (<font color='blue'><b>Bennet</b></font>) was gone, he (<font color='blue'><b>Bennet</b></font>)
turned to his (<font color='blue'><b>Bennet</b></font>) daughter, and said:

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Jane, I congratulate you. You will be a very happy woman.''

 (<font color='red'><b>daughter</b></font>)</div><p/>Jane went to him (<font color='blue'><b>Bennet</b></font>) instantly, kissed him (<font color='blue'><b>Bennet</b></font>), and thanked him (<font color='blue'><b>Bennet</b></font>) for his (<font color='blue'><b>Bennet</b></font>)
goodness.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``You are a good girl;''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Bennet</b></font>) replied, <div class="bookquote">``and I have great pleasure in
thinking you will be so happily settled. I have not a doubt of your
doing very well together. Your tempers are by no means unlike. You are
each of you so complying, that nothing will ever be resolved on; so
easy, that every servant will cheat you; and so generous, that you will
always exceed your income.''

 (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I hope not so. Imprudence or thoughtlessness in money matters would be
unpardonable in me.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Exceed their income! My dear Mr. Bennet,''  (<font color='red'><b>wife</b></font>)</div>cried his (<font color='blue'><b>Bennet</b></font>) wife, <div class="bookquote">``what are you
talking of? Why, he (<font color='blue'><b>Bennet</b></font>) has four or five thousand a year, and very likely
more.''  (<font color='red'><b>wife</b></font>)</div>Then addressing her (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>) daughter, <div class="bookquote">``Oh! my dear, dear Jane, I am so
happy! I am sure I shan't get a wink of sleep all night. I knew how it
would be. I always said it must be so, at last. I was sure you could not
be so beautiful for nothing! I remember, as soon as ever I saw him (<font color='blue'><b>Bennet</b></font>), when
he (<font color='blue'><b>Bennet</b></font>) first came into Hertfordshire last year, I thought how likely it was
that you should come together. Oh! he (<font color='blue'><b>Bennet</b></font>) is the handsomest young man that
ever was seen!''

 (<font color='red'><b>daughter</b></font>)</div><p/>Wickham, Lydia, were all forgotten. Jane was beyond competition her (<font color='blue'><b>Jane</b></font>)
favourite child. At that moment, she (<font color='blue'><b>Jane</b></font>) cared for no other. Her (<font color='blue'><b>Jane</b></font>) younger
sisters soon began to make interest with her (<font color='blue'><b>Jane</b></font>) for objects of happiness
which she (<font color='blue'><b>Jane</b></font>) might in future be able to dispense.

<p/>Mary petitioned for the use of the library at Netherfield; and Kitty
begged very hard for a few balls there every winter.

<p/>Bingley, from this time, was of course a daily visitor at Longbourn;
coming frequently before breakfast, and always remaining till after
supper; unless when some barbarous neighbour, who could not be enough
detested, had given him (<font color='blue'><b>visitor</b></font>) an invitation to dinner which he (<font color='blue'><b>visitor</b></font>) thought himself
obliged to accept.

<p/>Elizabeth had now but little time for conversation with her (<font color='blue'><b>Elizabeth</b></font>) sister; for
while he (<font color='blue'><b>visitor</b></font>) was present, Jane had no attention to bestow on anyone else;
but she (<font color='blue'><b>Jane</b></font>) found herself considerably useful to both of them in those hours
of separation that must sometimes occur. In the absence of Jane, he (<font color='blue'><b>visitor</b></font>)
always attached himself to Elizabeth, for the pleasure of talking of
her (<font color='blue'><b>Elizabeth</b></font>); and when Bingley was gone, Jane constantly sought the same means of
relief.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``He (<font color='blue'><b>Bennet</b></font>) has made me so happy,''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>said she (<font color='blue'><b>Jane</b></font>), one evening, <div class="bookquote">``by telling me that he (<font color='blue'><b>Bennet</b></font>)
was totally ignorant of my being in town last spring! I had not believed
it possible.''

 (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I suspected as much,''  (<font color='red'><b>Elizabeth/Miss Bennet/Miss Elizabeth</b></font>)</div>replied Elizabeth. <div class="bookquote">``But how did he (<font color='blue'><b>Bennet</b></font>) account for
it?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``It must have been his (<font color='blue'><b>Bennet</b></font>) sister's doing. They were certainly no friends to
his (<font color='blue'><b>Bennet</b></font>) acquaintance with me, which I cannot wonder at, since he (<font color='blue'><b>Bennet</b></font>) might have
chosen so much more advantageously in many respects. But when they see,
as I trust they will, that their brother is happy with me, they will
learn to be contented, and we shall be on good terms again; though we
can never be what we once were to each other.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``That is the most unforgiving speech,''  (<font color='red'><b>Elizabeth/Miss Bennet/Miss Elizabeth</b></font>)</div>said Elizabeth, <div class="bookquote">``that I ever
heard you utter. Good girl! It would vex me, indeed, to see you again
the dupe of Miss Bingley's pretended regard.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Elizabeth/Miss Bennet/Miss Elizabeth</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Would you believe it, Lizzy, that when he (<font color='blue'><b>brother</b></font>) went to town last November,
he (<font color='blue'><b>brother</b></font>) really loved me, and nothing but a persuasion of _my_ being
indifferent would have prevented his (<font color='blue'><b>brother</b></font>) coming down again!''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``He (<font color='blue'><b>brother</b></font>) made a little mistake to be sure; but it is to the credit of his (<font color='blue'><b>brother</b></font>)
modesty.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Jane</b></font>)</div><p/>This naturally introduced a panegyric from Jane on his (<font color='blue'><b>Bingley</b></font>) diffidence, and
the little value he (<font color='blue'><b>Bingley</b></font>) put on his (<font color='blue'><b>Bingley</b></font>) own good qualities. Elizabeth was pleased
to find that he (<font color='blue'><b>Bingley</b></font>) had not betrayed the interference of his (<font color='blue'><b>Bingley</b></font>) friend; for,
though Jane had the most generous and forgiving heart in the world, she (<font color='blue'><b>Jane</b></font>)
knew it was a circumstance which must prejudice her (<font color='blue'><b>Jane</b></font>) against him (<font color='blue'><b>Bingley</b></font>).

<p/><div class="bookquote">``I am certainly the most fortunate creature that ever existed!''  (<font color='red'><b>Jane</b></font>)</div>cried
Jane. <div class="bookquote">``Oh! Lizzy, why am I thus singled from my family, and blessed
above them all! If I could but see _you_ as happy! If there _were_ but
such another man for you!''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``If you were to give me forty such men, I never could be so happy as
you. Till I have your disposition, your goodness, I never can have your
happiness. No, no, let me shift for myself; and, perhaps, if I have very
good luck, I may meet with another Mr. Collins in time.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Longbourn</b></font>)</div><p/>The situation of affairs in the Longbourn family could not be long a
secret. Mrs. Bennet was privileged to whisper it to Mrs. Phillips,
and she (<font color='blue'><b>Phillips</b></font>) ventured, without any permission, to do the same by all her (<font color='blue'><b>Phillips</b></font>)
neighbours in Meryton.

<p/>The Bennets were speedily pronounced to be the luckiest family in the
world, though only a few weeks before, when Lydia had first run away,
they had been generally proved to be marked out for misfortune.



<p/>Chapter 56


<p/>One morning, about a week after Bingley's engagement with Jane had been
formed, as he (<font color='blue'><b>Bingley</b></font>) and the females of the family were sitting together in the
dining-room, their attention was suddenly drawn to the window, by the
sound of a carriage; and they perceived a chaise and four driving up
the lawn. It was too early in the morning for visitors, and besides, the
equipage did not answer to that of any of their neighbours. The horses
were post; and neither the carriage, nor the livery of the servant who
preceded it, were familiar to them. As it was certain, however, that
somebody was coming, Bingley instantly prevailed on Miss Bennet to avoid
the confinement of such an intrusion, and walk away with him (<font color='blue'><b>Bingley</b></font>) into the
shrubbery. They both set off, and the conjectures of the remaining three
continued, though with little satisfaction, till the door was thrown
open and their visitor entered. It was Lady Catherine de Bourgh.

<p/>They were of course all intending to be surprised; but their
astonishment was beyond their expectation; and on the part of Mrs.
Bennet and Kitty, though she (<font color='blue'><b>Bennet</b></font>) was perfectly unknown to them, even
inferior to what Elizabeth felt.

<p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>Elizabeth</b></font>) entered the room with an air more than usually ungracious, made no
other reply to Elizabeth's salutation than a slight inclination of the
head, and sat down without saying a word. Elizabeth had mentioned her (<font color='blue'><b>Elizabeth</b></font>)
name to her (<font color='blue'><b>Elizabeth</b></font>) mother on her (<font color='blue'><b>Elizabeth</b></font>) ladyship's entrance, though no request of
introduction had been made.

<p/>Mrs. Bennet, all amazement, though flattered by having a guest of such
high importance, received her (<font color='blue'><b>Bennet</b></font>) with the utmost politeness. After sitting
for a moment in silence, she (<font color='blue'><b>Bennet</b></font>) said very stiffly to Elizabeth,

<p/><div class="bookquote">``I hope you are well, Miss Bennet. That lady, I suppose, is your
mother.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Elizabeth/Miss Bennet/Miss Elizabeth</b></font>)</div><p/>Elizabeth replied very concisely that she (<font color='blue'><b>Elizabeth</b></font>) was.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``And _that_ I suppose is one of your sisters.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Yes, madam,''  (<font color='red'><b>Mrs. Bennet</b></font>)</div>said Mrs. Bennet, delighted to speak to Lady Catherine.
<div class="bookquote">``She (<font color='blue'><b>madam</b></font>) is my youngest girl but one. My youngest of all is lately married,
and my eldest is somewhere about the grounds, walking with a young man
who, I believe, will soon become a part of the family.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``You have a very small park here,''  (<font color='red'><b>Lady Catherine/Lady Catherine de Bourgh/Catherine</b></font>)</div>returned Lady Catherine after a short
silence.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``It is nothing in comparison of Rosings, my lady, I dare say; but I
assure you it is much larger than Sir William Lucas's.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``This must be a most inconvenient sitting room for the evening, in
summer; the windows are full west.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Mrs. Bennet</b></font>)</div><p/>Mrs. Bennet assured her (<font color='blue'><b>Bennet</b></font>) that they never sat there after dinner, and then
added:

<p/><div class="bookquote">``May I take the liberty of asking your ladyship whether you left Mr. and
Mrs. Collins well.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Mrs. Bennet</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Yes, very well. I saw them the night before last.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Elizabeth/Miss Bennet/Miss Elizabeth</b></font>)</div><p/>Elizabeth now expected that she (<font color='blue'><b>Elizabeth</b></font>) would produce a letter for her (<font color='blue'><b>Elizabeth</b></font>) from
Charlotte, as it seemed the only probable motive for her (<font color='blue'><b>Elizabeth</b></font>) calling. But no
letter appeared, and she (<font color='blue'><b>Elizabeth</b></font>) was completely puzzled.

<p/>Mrs. Bennet, with great civility, begged her (<font color='blue'><b>Bennet</b></font>) ladyship to take some
refreshment; but Lady Catherine very resolutely, and not very politely,
declined eating anything; and then, rising up, said to Elizabeth,

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Miss Bennet, there seemed to be a prettyish kind of a little wilderness
on one side of your lawn. I should be glad to take a turn in it, if you
will favour me with your company.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Elizabeth/Miss Bennet/Miss Elizabeth</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Go, my dear,''  (<font color='red'><b>mother</b></font>)</div>cried her (<font color='blue'><b>Elizabeth</b></font>) mother, <div class="bookquote">``and show her (<font color='blue'><b>Bennet</b></font>) ladyship about the
different walks. I think she (<font color='blue'><b>Bennet</b></font>) will be pleased with the hermitage.''

 (<font color='red'><b>mother</b></font>)</div><p/>Elizabeth obeyed, and running into her (<font color='blue'><b>Elizabeth</b></font>) own room for her (<font color='blue'><b>Elizabeth</b></font>) parasol,
attended her (<font color='blue'><b>Elizabeth</b></font>) noble guest downstairs. As they passed through the
hall, Lady Catherine opened the doors into the dining-parlour and
drawing-room, and pronouncing them, after a short survey, to be decent
looking rooms, walked on.

<p/>Her (<font color='blue'><b>Catherine</b></font>) carriage remained at the door, and Elizabeth saw that her (<font color='blue'><b>Elizabeth</b></font>)
waiting-woman was in it. They proceeded in silence along the gravel walk
that led to the copse; Elizabeth was determined to make no effort for
conversation with a woman who was now more than usually insolent and
disagreeable.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``How could I ever think her (<font color='blue'><b>Bennet</b></font>) like her (<font color='blue'><b>Bennet</b></font>) nephew?''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>said she (<font color='blue'><b>Elizabeth</b></font>), as she (<font color='blue'><b>Elizabeth</b></font>) looked in
her (<font color='blue'><b>Elizabeth</b></font>) face.

<p/>As soon as they entered the copse, Lady Catherine began in the following
manner:--

<p/><div class="bookquote">``You can be at no loss, Miss Bennet, to understand the reason of my
journey hither. Your own heart, your own conscience, must tell you why I
come.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Lady Catherine/Lady Catherine de Bourgh/Catherine</b></font>)</div><p/>Elizabeth looked with unaffected astonishment.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Indeed, you are mistaken, Madam. I have not been at all able to account
for the honour of seeing you here.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Miss Bennet,''  (<font color='red'><b>ladyship</b></font>)</div>replied her (<font color='blue'><b>Elizabeth</b></font>) ladyship, in an angry tone, <div class="bookquote">``you ought to
know, that I am not to be trifled with. But however insincere _you_ may
choose to be, you shall not find _me_ so. My character has ever been
celebrated for its sincerity and frankness, and in a cause of such
moment as this, I shall certainly not depart from it. A report of a most
alarming nature reached me two days ago. I was told that not only your
sister was on the point of being most advantageously married, but that
you, that Miss Elizabeth Bennet, would, in all likelihood, be soon
afterwards united to my nephew, my own nephew, Mr. Darcy. Though I
_know_ it must be a scandalous falsehood, though I would not injure him (<font color='blue'><b>Darcy</b></font>)
so much as to suppose the truth of it possible, I instantly resolved
on setting off for this place, that I might make my sentiments known to
you.''

 (<font color='red'><b>ladyship</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``If you believed it impossible to be true,''  (<font color='red'><b>Elizabeth/Miss Bennet/Miss Elizabeth</b></font>)</div>said Elizabeth, colouring
with astonishment and disdain, <div class="bookquote">``I wonder you took the trouble of coming
so far. What could your ladyship propose by it?''

 (<font color='red'><b>Elizabeth/Miss Bennet/Miss Elizabeth</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``At once to insist upon having such a report universally contradicted.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Your coming to Longbourn, to see me and my family,''  (<font color='red'><b>Elizabeth/Miss Bennet/Miss Elizabeth</b></font>)</div>said Elizabeth
coolly, <div class="bookquote">``will be rather a confirmation of it; if, indeed, such a report
is in existence.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Elizabeth/Miss Bennet/Miss Elizabeth</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``If! Do you then pretend to be ignorant of it? Has it not been
industriously circulated by yourselves? Do you not know that such a
report is spread abroad?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I never heard that it was.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``And can you likewise declare, that there is no foundation for it?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I do not pretend to possess equal frankness with your ladyship. You may
ask questions which I shall not choose to answer.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``This is not to be borne. Miss Bennet, I insist on being satisfied. Has
he (<font color='blue'><b>I</b></font>), has my nephew, made you an offer of marriage?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Your ladyship has declared it to be impossible.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``It ought to be so; it must be so, while he (<font color='blue'><b>nephew</b></font>) retains the use of his (<font color='blue'><b>nephew</b></font>)
reason. But your arts and allurements may, in a moment of infatuation,
have made him (<font color='blue'><b>nephew</b></font>) forget what he (<font color='blue'><b>nephew</b></font>) owes to himself and to all his (<font color='blue'><b>nephew</b></font>) family. You
may have drawn him (<font color='blue'><b>nephew</b></font>) in.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``If I have, I shall be the last person to confess it.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Miss Bennet, do you know who I am? I have not been accustomed to such
language as this. I am almost the nearest relation he (<font color='blue'><b>nephew</b></font>) has in the world,
and am entitled to know all his (<font color='blue'><b>nephew</b></font>) dearest concerns.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``But you are not entitled to know mine; nor will such behaviour as this,
ever induce me to be explicit.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Let me be rightly understood. This match, to which you have the
presumption to aspire, can never take place. No, never. Mr. Darcy is
engaged to my daughter. Now what have you to say?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Only this; that if he (<font color='blue'><b>Darcy</b></font>) is so, you can have no reason to suppose he (<font color='blue'><b>Darcy</b></font>) will
make an offer to me.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Lady Catherine/Lady Catherine de Bourgh/Catherine</b></font>)</div><p/>Lady Catherine hesitated for a moment, and then replied:

<p/><div class="bookquote">``The engagement between them is of a peculiar kind. From their infancy,
they have been intended for each other. It was the favourite wish of
_his (<font color='blue'><b>Darcy</b></font>)_ mother, as well as of hers. While in their cradles, we planned
the union: and now, at the moment when the wishes of both sisters would
be accomplished in their marriage, to be prevented by a young woman of
inferior birth, of no importance in the world, and wholly unallied to
the family! Do you pay no regard to the wishes of his (<font color='blue'><b>Darcy</b></font>) friends? To his (<font color='blue'><b>Darcy</b></font>)
tacit engagement with Miss de Bourgh? Are you lost to every feeling of
propriety and delicacy? Have you not heard me say that from his (<font color='blue'><b>Darcy</b></font>) earliest
hours he (<font color='blue'><b>Darcy</b></font>) was destined for his (<font color='blue'><b>Darcy</b></font>) cousin?''

 (<font color='red'><b>Lady Catherine/Lady Catherine de Bourgh/Catherine</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Yes, and I had heard it before. But what is that to me? If there is
no other objection to my marrying your nephew, I shall certainly not
be kept from it by knowing that his (<font color='blue'><b>nephew</b></font>) mother and aunt wished him (<font color='blue'><b>nephew</b></font>) to
marry Miss de Bourgh. You both did as much as you could in planning the
marriage. Its completion depended on others. If Mr. Darcy is neither
by honour nor inclination confined to his (<font color='blue'><b>Darcy</b></font>) cousin, why is not he (<font color='blue'><b>Darcy</b></font>) to make
another choice? And if I am that choice, why may not I accept him (<font color='blue'><b>Darcy</b></font>)?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Because honour, decorum, prudence, nay, interest, forbid it. Yes,
Miss Bennet, interest; for do not expect to be noticed by his (<font color='blue'><b>Darcy</b></font>) family or
friends, if you wilfully act against the inclinations of all. You will
be censured, slighted, and despised, by everyone connected with him (<font color='blue'><b>Darcy</b></font>).
Your alliance will be a disgrace; your name will never even be mentioned
by any of us.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``These are heavy misfortunes,''  (<font color='red'><b>Elizabeth/Miss Bennet/Miss Elizabeth</b></font>)</div>replied Elizabeth. <div class="bookquote">``But the wife of Mr.
Darcy must have such extraordinary sources of happiness necessarily
attached to her (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>) situation, that she (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>) could, upon the whole, have no cause
to repine.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Obstinate, headstrong girl! I am ashamed of you! Is this your gratitude
for my attentions to you last spring? Is nothing due to me on that
score? Let us sit down. You are to understand, Miss Bennet, that I came
here with the determined resolution of carrying my purpose; nor will
I be dissuaded from it. I have not been used to submit to any person's
whims. I have not been in the habit of brooking disappointment.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">''_That_ will make your ladyship's situation at present more pitiable;
but it will have no effect on me.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I will not be interrupted. Hear me in silence. My daughter and my
nephew are formed for each other. They are descended, on the maternal
side, from the same noble line; and, on the father's, from respectable,
honourable, and ancient--though untitled--families. Their fortune on
both sides is splendid. They are destined for each other by the voice of
every member of their respective houses; and what is to divide them?
The upstart pretensions of a young woman without family, connections,
or fortune. Is this to be endured! But it must not, shall not be. If you
were sensible of your own good, you would not wish to quit the sphere in
which you have been brought up.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``In marrying your nephew, I should not consider myself as quitting that

equal.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``True. You _are_ a gentleman's daughter. But who was your mother?

 (<font color='red'><b>Elizabeth/Miss Bennet/Miss Elizabeth</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Tell me once for all, are you engaged to him (<font color='blue'><b>nephew</b></font>)?''

 (<font color='red'><b>Elizabeth/Miss Bennet/Miss Elizabeth</b></font>)</div><p/>Though Elizabeth would not, for the mere purpose of obliging Lady
Catherine, have answered this question, she (<font color='blue'><b>Elizabeth</b></font>) could not but say, after a
moment's deliberation:

<p/><div class="bookquote">``I am not.''

 (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div><p/>Lady Catherine seemed pleased.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``And will you promise me, never to enter into such an engagement?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I will make no promise of the kind.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Miss Bennet I am shocked and astonished. I expected to find a more
reasonable young woman. But do not deceive yourself into a belief that
I will ever recede. I shall not go away till you have given me the
assurance I require.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``And I certainly _never_ shall give it. I am not to be intimidated into
anything so wholly unreasonable. Your ladyship wants Mr. Darcy to marry
your daughter; but would my giving you the wished-for promise make their
marriage at all more probable? Supposing him (<font color='blue'><b>Darcy</b></font>) to be attached to me, would
my refusing to accept his (<font color='blue'><b>Darcy</b></font>) hand make him (<font color='blue'><b>Darcy</b></font>) wish to bestow it on his (<font color='blue'><b>Darcy</b></font>) cousin?
Allow me to say, Lady Catherine, that the arguments with which you have
supported this extraordinary application have been as frivolous as the
application was ill-judged. You have widely mistaken my character, if
you think I can be worked on by such persuasions as these. How far your
nephew might approve of your interference in his (<font color='blue'><b>nephew</b></font>) affairs, I cannot tell;
but you have certainly no right to concern yourself in mine. I must beg,
therefore, to be importuned no farther on the subject.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Not so hasty, if you please. I have by no means done. To all the
objections I have already urged, I have still another to add. I am
no stranger to the particulars of your youngest sister's infamous
elopement. I know it all; that the young man's marrying her (<font color='blue'><b>sister</b></font>) was a
patched-up business, at the expence of your father and uncles. And is
such a girl to be my nephew's sister? Is her (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) husband, is the son of his (<font color='blue'><b>husband</b></font>)
late father's steward, to be his (<font color='blue'><b>husband</b></font>) brother? Heaven and earth!--of what are
you thinking? Are the shades of Pemberley to be thus polluted?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``You can now have nothing further to say,''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Catherine</b></font>) resentfully answered.
<div class="bookquote">``You have insulted me in every possible method. I must beg to return to
the house.''

 (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div><p/>And she (<font color='blue'><b>Catherine</b></font>) rose as she (<font color='blue'><b>Catherine</b></font>) spoke. Lady Catherine rose also, and they turned
back. Her (<font color='blue'><b>Catherine</b></font>) ladyship was highly incensed.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``You have no regard, then, for the honour and credit of my nephew!
Unfeeling, selfish girl! Do you not consider that a connection with you
must disgrace him (<font color='blue'><b>nephew</b></font>) in the eyes of everybody?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``You are then resolved to have him (<font color='blue'><b>nephew</b></font>)?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I have said no such thing. I am only resolved to act in that manner,

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``It is well. You refuse, then, to oblige me. You refuse to obey the
claims of duty, honour, and gratitude. You are determined to ruin him (<font color='blue'><b>nephew</b></font>) in

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Neither duty, nor honour, nor gratitude,''  (<font color='red'><b>Elizabeth/Miss Bennet/Miss Elizabeth</b></font>)</div>replied Elizabeth, <div class="bookquote">``have any

resentment of his (<font color='blue'><b>Darcy</b></font>) family, or the indignation of the world, if the former
_were_ excited by his (<font color='blue'><b>Darcy</b></font>) marrying me, it would not give me one moment's

the scorn.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Elizabeth/Miss Bennet/Miss Elizabeth</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``And this is your real opinion! This is your final resolve! Very well.
I shall now know how to act. Do not imagine, Miss Bennet, that your

 (<font color='red'><b>Lady Catherine/Lady Catherine de Bourgh/Catherine</b></font>)</div><p/>In this manner Lady Catherine talked on, till they were at the door of
the carriage, when, turning hastily round, she (<font color='blue'><b>Catherine</b></font>) added, <div class="bookquote">``I take no leave
of you, Miss Bennet. I send no compliments to your mother. You deserve
no such attention. I am most seriously displeased.''

 (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div><p/>Elizabeth made no answer; and without attempting to persuade her (<font color='blue'><b>Elizabeth</b></font>)
ladyship to return into the house, walked quietly into it herself. She (<font color='blue'><b>Elizabeth</b></font>)
heard the carriage drive away as she (<font color='blue'><b>Elizabeth</b></font>) proceeded up stairs. Her (<font color='blue'><b>Elizabeth</b></font>) mother
impatiently met her (<font color='blue'><b>Elizabeth</b></font>) at the door of the dressing-room, to ask why Lady
Catherine would not come in again and rest herself.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``She (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) did not choose it,''  (<font color='red'><b>daughter</b></font>)</div>said her (<font color='blue'><b>Catherine</b></font>) daughter, <div class="bookquote">``she (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) would go.''

 (<font color='red'><b>daughter</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``She (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) is a very fine-looking woman! and her (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) calling here was prodigiously
civil! for she (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) only came, I suppose, to tell us the Collinses were
well. She (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) is on her (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) road somewhere, I dare say, and so, passing through
Meryton, thought she (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) might as well call on you. I suppose she (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) had
nothing particular to say to you, Lizzy?''

 (<font color='red'><b>Elizabeth/Miss Bennet/Miss Elizabeth</b></font>)</div><p/>Elizabeth was forced to give into a little falsehood here; for to
acknowledge the substance of their conversation was impossible.



<p/>Chapter 57


<p/>The discomposure of spirits which this extraordinary visit threw
Elizabeth into, could not be easily overcome; nor could she (<font color='blue'><b>Elizabeth</b></font>), for many
hours, learn to think of it less than incessantly. Lady Catherine, it
appeared, had actually taken the trouble of this journey from Rosings,
for the sole purpose of breaking off her (<font color='blue'><b>Catherine</b></font>) supposed engagement with Mr.
Darcy. It was a rational scheme, to be sure! but from what the report
of their engagement could originate, Elizabeth was at a loss to imagine;
till she (<font color='blue'><b>Elizabeth</b></font>) recollected that _his (<font color='blue'><b>Darcy</b></font>)_ being the intimate friend of Bingley,
and _her (<font color='blue'><b>Elizabeth</b></font>)_ being the sister of Jane, was enough, at a time when the
expectation of one wedding made everybody eager for another, to supply
the idea. She (<font color='blue'><b>Elizabeth</b></font>) had not herself forgotten to feel that the marriage of her (<font color='blue'><b>Elizabeth</b></font>)
sister must bring them more frequently together. And her (<font color='blue'><b>Elizabeth</b></font>) neighbours
at Lucas Lodge, therefore -LRB-for through their communication with the
Collinses, the report, she (<font color='blue'><b>Elizabeth</b></font>) concluded, had reached Lady Catherine-RRB-, had
only set that down as almost certain and immediate, which she (<font color='blue'><b>Catherine</b></font>) had looked
forward to as possible at some future time.

<p/>In revolving Lady Catherine's expressions, however, she (<font color='blue'><b>Catherine</b></font>) could not help
feeling some uneasiness as to the possible consequence of her (<font color='blue'><b>Catherine</b></font>) persisting
in this interference. From what she (<font color='blue'><b>Catherine</b></font>) had said of her (<font color='blue'><b>Catherine</b></font>) resolution to
prevent their marriage, it occurred to Elizabeth that she (<font color='blue'><b>Elizabeth</b></font>) must meditate
an application to her (<font color='blue'><b>Elizabeth</b></font>) nephew; and how _he (<font color='blue'><b>nephew</b></font>)_ might take a similar
representation of the evils attached to a connection with her (<font color='blue'><b>Elizabeth</b></font>), she (<font color='blue'><b>Elizabeth</b></font>) dared
not pronounce. She (<font color='blue'><b>Elizabeth</b></font>) knew not the exact degree of his (<font color='blue'><b>nephew</b></font>) affection for his (<font color='blue'><b>nephew</b></font>)
aunt, or his (<font color='blue'><b>nephew</b></font>) dependence on her (<font color='blue'><b>Elizabeth</b></font>) judgment, but it was natural to suppose
that he (<font color='blue'><b>nephew</b></font>) thought much higher of her (<font color='blue'><b>Elizabeth</b></font>) ladyship than _she (<font color='blue'><b>Elizabeth</b></font>)_ could do; and it
was certain that, in enumerating the miseries of a marriage with _one_,
whose immediate connections were so unequal to his (<font color='blue'><b>nephew</b></font>) own, his (<font color='blue'><b>nephew</b></font>) aunt would
address him (<font color='blue'><b>nephew</b></font>) on his (<font color='blue'><b>nephew</b></font>) weakest side. With his (<font color='blue'><b>nephew</b></font>) notions of dignity, he (<font color='blue'><b>nephew</b></font>) would
probably feel that the arguments, which to Elizabeth had appeared weak
and ridiculous, contained much good sense and solid reasoning.

<p/>If he (<font color='blue'><b>nephew</b></font>) had been wavering before as to what he (<font color='blue'><b>nephew</b></font>) should do, which had often
seemed likely, the advice and entreaty of so near a relation might
settle every doubt, and determine him (<font color='blue'><b>nephew</b></font>) at once to be as happy as dignity
unblemished could make him (<font color='blue'><b>nephew</b></font>). In that case he (<font color='blue'><b>nephew</b></font>) would return no more. Lady
Catherine might see him (<font color='blue'><b>nephew</b></font>) in her (<font color='blue'><b>Catherine</b></font>) way through town; and his (<font color='blue'><b>nephew</b></font>) engagement to
Bingley of coming again to Netherfield must give way.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``If, therefore, an excuse for not keeping his (<font color='blue'><b>it</b></font>) promise should come to his (<font color='blue'><b>it</b></font>)
friend within a few days,''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Catherine</b></font>) added, <div class="bookquote">``I shall know how to understand
it. I shall then give over every expectation, every wish of his (<font color='blue'><b>it</b></font>)
constancy. If he (<font color='blue'><b>it</b></font>) is satisfied with only regretting me, when he (<font color='blue'><b>it</b></font>) might
have obtained my affections and hand, I shall soon cease to regret him (<font color='blue'><b>it</b></font>)
at all.''

 (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div><p/>* * * * *

<p/>The surprise of the rest of the family, on hearing who their visitor had
been, was very great; but they obligingly satisfied it, with the same
kind of supposition which had appeased Mrs. Bennet's curiosity; and
Elizabeth was spared from much teasing on the subject.

<p/>The next morning, as she (<font color='blue'><b>Elizabeth</b></font>) was going downstairs, she (<font color='blue'><b>Elizabeth</b></font>) was met by her (<font color='blue'><b>Elizabeth</b></font>)
father, who came out of his (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) library with a letter in his (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) hand.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Lizzy,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>said he (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>), <div class="bookquote">``I was going to look for you; come into my room.''

 (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div><p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>Elizabeth</b></font>) followed him (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) thither; and her (<font color='blue'><b>Elizabeth</b></font>) curiosity to know what he (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) had to
tell her (<font color='blue'><b>Elizabeth</b></font>) was heightened by the supposition of its being in some manner
connected with the letter he (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) held. It suddenly struck her (<font color='blue'><b>Elizabeth</b></font>) that it
might be from Lady Catherine; and she (<font color='blue'><b>Catherine</b></font>) anticipated with dismay all the
consequent explanations.

<p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>Catherine</b></font>) followed her (<font color='blue'><b>Catherine</b></font>) father to the fire place, and they both sat down. He (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>)
then said,

<p/><div class="bookquote">``I have received a letter this morning that has astonished me
exceedingly. As it principally concerns yourself, you ought to know its
contents. I did not know before, that I had two daughters on the brink
of matrimony. Let me congratulate you on a very important conquest.''

 (<font color='red'><b>He</b></font>)</div><p/>The colour now rushed into Elizabeth's cheeks in the instantaneous
conviction of its being a letter from the nephew, instead of the aunt;
and she (<font color='blue'><b>aunt</b></font>) was undetermined whether most to be pleased that he (<font color='blue'><b>nephew</b></font>) explained
himself at all, or offended that his (<font color='blue'><b>nephew</b></font>) letter was not rather addressed to
herself; when her (<font color='blue'><b>aunt</b></font>) father continued:

<p/><div class="bookquote">``You look conscious. Young ladies have great penetration in such matters
as these; but I think I may defy even _your_ sagacity, to discover the
name of your admirer. This letter is from Mr. Collins.''

 (<font color='red'><b>father</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``From Mr. Collins! and what can _he (<font color='blue'><b>Collins</b></font>)_ have to say?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/>``Something very much to the purpose of course. He (<font color='blue'><b>Collins</b></font>) begins with
congratulations on the approaching nuptials of my eldest daughter, of
which, it seems, he (<font color='blue'><b>Collins</b></font>) has been told by some of the good-natured, gossiping
Lucases. I shall not sport with your impatience, by reading what he (<font color='blue'><b>Collins</b></font>) says
on that point. What relates to yourself, is as follows: <div class="bookquote">``Having thus
offered you the sincere congratulations of Mrs. Collins and myself on
this happy event, let me now add a short hint on the subject of another;
of which we have been advertised by the same authority. Your daughter
Elizabeth, it is presumed, will not long bear the name of Bennet, after
her (<font color='blue'><b>Bennet</b></font>) elder sister has resigned it, and the chosen partner of her (<font color='blue'><b>Bennet</b></font>) fate may
be reasonably looked up to as one of the most illustrious personages in
this land.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/>``Can you possibly guess, Lizzy, who is meant by this? <div class="bookquote">``This young
gentleman is blessed, in a peculiar way, with every thing the heart of
mortal can most desire,--splendid property, noble kindred, and extensive
patronage. Yet in spite of all these temptations, let me warn my cousin
Elizabeth, and yourself, of what evils you may incur by a precipitate
closure with this gentleman's proposals, which, of course, you will be
inclined to take immediate advantage of.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/>``Have you any idea, Lizzy, who this gentleman is? But now it comes out:

<p/><div class="bookquote">''`My motive for cautioning you is as follows. We have reason to imagine
that his (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) aunt, Lady Catherine de Bourgh, does not look on the match with
a friendly eye.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">''_Mr. Darcy_, you see, is the man! Now, Lizzy, I think I _have_
surprised you. Could he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>), or the Lucases, have pitched on any man within
the circle of our acquaintance, whose name would have given the lie
more effectually to what they related? Mr. Darcy, who never looks at any
woman but to see a blemish, and who probably never looked at you in his (<font color='blue'><b>Darcy</b></font>)
life! It is admirable!''

 (<font color='red'><b>Elizabeth/Miss Bennet/Miss Elizabeth</b></font>)</div><p/>Elizabeth tried to join in her (<font color='blue'><b>Elizabeth</b></font>) father's pleasantry, but could only force
one most reluctant smile. Never had his (<font color='blue'><b>Darcy</b></font>) wit been directed in a manner so
little agreeable to her (<font color='blue'><b>Elizabeth</b></font>).

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Are you not diverted?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Oh! yes. Pray read on.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">''`After mentioning the likelihood of this marriage to her (<font color='blue'><b>Elizabeth</b></font>) ladyship last
night, she (<font color='blue'><b>Elizabeth</b></font>) immediately, with her (<font color='blue'><b>Elizabeth</b></font>) usual condescension, expressed what she (<font color='blue'><b>Elizabeth</b></font>)
felt on the occasion; when it became apparent, that on the score of some
family objections on the part of my cousin, she (<font color='blue'><b>Elizabeth</b></font>) would never give her (<font color='blue'><b>Elizabeth</b></font>)
consent to what she (<font color='blue'><b>Elizabeth</b></font>) termed so disgraceful a match. I thought it my duty
to give the speediest intelligence of this to my cousin, that she (<font color='blue'><b>Elizabeth</b></font>) and
her (<font color='blue'><b>Elizabeth</b></font>) noble admirer may be aware of what they are about, and not run
hastily into a marriage which has not been properly sanctioned.''  (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Collins</b></font>)</div>Mr.
Collins moreover adds, <div class="bookquote">``I am truly rejoiced that my cousin Lydia's sad
business has been so well hushed up, and am only concerned that their
living together before the marriage took place should be so generally
known. I must not, however, neglect the duties of my station, or refrain
from declaring my amazement at hearing that you received the young
couple into your house as soon as they were married. It was an
encouragement of vice; and had I been the rector of Longbourn, I should
very strenuously have opposed it. You ought certainly to forgive them,
as a Christian, but never to admit them in your sight, or allow their
names to be mentioned in your hearing.''  (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Collins</b></font>)</div>That is his (<font color='blue'><b>Collins</b></font>) notion of Christian
forgiveness! The rest of his (<font color='blue'><b>Collins</b></font>) letter is only about his (<font color='blue'><b>Collins</b></font>) dear Charlotte's
situation, and his (<font color='blue'><b>Collins</b></font>) expectation of a young olive-branch. But, Lizzy, you
look as if you did not enjoy it. You are not going to be _missish_,
I hope, and pretend to be affronted at an idle report. For what do we
live, but to make sport for our neighbours, and laugh at them in our
turn?''

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Oh!''  (<font color='red'><b>Elizabeth/Miss Bennet/Miss Elizabeth</b></font>)</div>cried Elizabeth, <div class="bookquote">``I am excessively diverted. But it is so
strange!''

 (<font color='red'><b>Elizabeth/Miss Bennet/Miss Elizabeth</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Yes--_that_ is what makes it amusing. Had they fixed on any other man
it would have been nothing; but _his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>)_ perfect indifference, and _your_
pointed dislike, make it so delightfully absurd! Much as I abominate
writing, I would not give up Mr. Collins's correspondence for any
consideration. Nay, when I read a letter of his (<font color='blue'><b>Collins</b></font>), I cannot help giving
him (<font color='blue'><b>Collins</b></font>) the preference even over Wickham, much as I value the impudence and
hypocrisy of my son-in-law. And pray, Lizzy, what said Lady Catherine
about this report? Did she (<font color='blue'><b>Catherine</b></font>) call to refuse her (<font color='blue'><b>Catherine</b></font>) consent?''

 (<font color='red'><b>daughter</b></font>)</div><p/>To this question his (<font color='blue'><b>Collins</b></font>) daughter replied only with a laugh; and as it had
been asked without the least suspicion, she (<font color='blue'><b>daughter</b></font>) was not distressed by
his (<font color='blue'><b>Collins</b></font>) repeating it. Elizabeth had never been more at a loss to make her (<font color='blue'><b>Elizabeth</b></font>)
feelings appear what they were not. It was necessary to laugh, when she (<font color='blue'><b>Elizabeth</b></font>)
would rather have cried. Her (<font color='blue'><b>Elizabeth</b></font>) father had most cruelly mortified her (<font color='blue'><b>Elizabeth</b></font>), by
what he (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) said of Mr. Darcy's indifference, and she (<font color='blue'><b>Elizabeth</b></font>) could do nothing but
wonder at such a want of penetration, or fear that perhaps, instead of
his (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) seeing too little, she (<font color='blue'><b>Elizabeth</b></font>) might have fancied too much.



<p/>Chapter 58


<p/>Instead of receiving any such letter of excuse from his (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) friend, as
Elizabeth half expected Mr. Bingley to do, he (<font color='blue'><b>Bingley</b></font>) was able to bring Darcy
with him (<font color='blue'><b>Bingley</b></font>) to Longbourn before many days had passed after Lady Catherine's
visit. The gentlemen arrived early; and, before Mrs. Bennet had time
to tell him (<font color='blue'><b>Bingley</b></font>) of their having seen his (<font color='blue'><b>Bingley</b></font>) aunt, of which her (<font color='blue'><b>Bennet</b></font>) daughter sat
in momentary dread, Bingley, who wanted to be alone with Jane, proposed
their all walking out. It was agreed to. Mrs. Bennet was not in the
habit of walking; Mary could never spare time; but the remaining five
set off together. Bingley and Jane, however, soon allowed the others
to outstrip them. They lagged behind, while Elizabeth, Kitty, and Darcy
were to entertain each other. Very little was said by either; Kitty
was too much afraid of him (<font color='blue'><b>Darcy</b></font>) to talk; Elizabeth was secretly forming a
desperate resolution; and perhaps he (<font color='blue'><b>Darcy</b></font>) might be doing the same.

<p/>They walked towards the Lucases, because Kitty wished to call upon
Maria; and as Elizabeth saw no occasion for making it a general concern,
when Kitty left them she (<font color='blue'><b>Kitty</b></font>) went boldly on with him (<font color='blue'><b>Darcy</b></font>) alone. Now was the
moment for her (<font color='blue'><b>Kitty</b></font>) resolution to be executed, and, while her (<font color='blue'><b>Kitty</b></font>) courage was
high, she (<font color='blue'><b>Kitty</b></font>) immediately said:

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Mr. Darcy, I am a very selfish creature; and, for the sake of giving
relief to my own feelings, care not how much I may be wounding yours. I
can no longer help thanking you for your unexampled kindness to my
poor sister. Ever since I have known it, I have been most anxious to
acknowledge to you how gratefully I feel it. Were it known to the rest
of my family, I should not have merely my own gratitude to express.''

 (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I am sorry, exceedingly sorry,''  (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Darcy/Darcy</b></font>)</div>replied Darcy, in a tone of surprise
and emotion, <div class="bookquote">``that you have ever been informed of what may, in a
mistaken light, have given you uneasiness. I did not think Mrs. Gardiner
was so little to be trusted.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Darcy/Darcy</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``You must not blame my aunt. Lydia's thoughtlessness first betrayed to
me that you had been concerned in the matter; and, of course, I could
not rest till I knew the particulars. Let me thank you again and again,
in the name of all my family, for that generous compassion which induced
you to take so much trouble, and bear so many mortifications, for the
sake of discovering them.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``If you _will_ thank me,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Darcy</b></font>) replied, <div class="bookquote">``let it be for yourself alone.
That the wish of giving happiness to you might add force to the other
inducements which led me on, I shall not attempt to deny. But your
_family_ owe me nothing. Much as I respect them, I believe I thought
only of _you_.''

 (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div><p/>Elizabeth was too much embarrassed to say a word. After a short pause,
her (<font color='blue'><b>Elizabeth</b></font>) companion added, <div class="bookquote">``You are too generous to trifle with me. If your
feelings are still what they were last April, tell me so at once. _My_
affections and wishes are unchanged, but one word from you will silence
me on this subject for ever.''

 (<font color='red'><b>companion</b></font>)</div><p/>Elizabeth, feeling all the more than common awkwardness and anxiety of
his (<font color='blue'><b>companion</b></font>) situation, now forced herself to speak; and immediately, though not
very fluently, gave him (<font color='blue'><b>companion</b></font>) to understand that her (<font color='blue'><b>Elizabeth</b></font>) sentiments had undergone
so material a change, since the period to which he (<font color='blue'><b>companion</b></font>) alluded, as to make
her (<font color='blue'><b>Elizabeth</b></font>) receive with gratitude and pleasure his (<font color='blue'><b>companion</b></font>) present assurances. The
happiness which this reply produced, was such as he (<font color='blue'><b>companion</b></font>) had probably never
felt before; and he (<font color='blue'><b>companion</b></font>) expressed himself on the occasion as sensibly and as
warmly as a man violently in love can be supposed to do. Had Elizabeth
been able to encounter his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) eye, she (<font color='blue'><b>Elizabeth</b></font>) might have seen how well the
expression of heartfelt delight, diffused over his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) face, became him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>);
but, though she (<font color='blue'><b>Elizabeth</b></font>) could not look, she (<font color='blue'><b>Elizabeth</b></font>) could listen, and he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) told her (<font color='blue'><b>Elizabeth</b></font>) of
feelings, which, in proving of what importance she (<font color='blue'><b>Elizabeth</b></font>) was to him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>), made his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>)
affection every moment more valuable.

<p/>They walked on, without knowing in what direction. There was too much to
be thought, and felt, and said, for attention to any other objects. She (<font color='blue'><b>Elizabeth</b></font>)
soon learnt that they were indebted for their present good understanding
to the efforts of his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) aunt, who did call on him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) in her (<font color='blue'><b>aunt</b></font>) return through
London, and there relate her (<font color='blue'><b>aunt</b></font>) journey to Longbourn, its motive, and the
substance of her (<font color='blue'><b>aunt</b></font>) conversation with Elizabeth; dwelling emphatically on
every expression of the latter which, in her (<font color='blue'><b>aunt</b></font>) ladyship's apprehension,
peculiarly denoted her (<font color='blue'><b>aunt</b></font>) perverseness and assurance; in the belief that
such a relation must assist her (<font color='blue'><b>aunt</b></font>) endeavours to obtain that promise
from her (<font color='blue'><b>aunt</b></font>) nephew which she (<font color='blue'><b>aunt</b></font>) had refused to give. But, unluckily for her (<font color='blue'><b>aunt</b></font>)
ladyship, its effect had been exactly contrariwise.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``It taught me to hope,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>said he (<font color='blue'><b>nephew</b></font>), <div class="bookquote">``as I had scarcely ever allowed myself
to hope before. I knew enough of your disposition to be certain that,
had you been absolutely, irrevocably decided against me, you would have
acknowledged it to Lady Catherine, frankly and openly.''

 (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div><p/>Elizabeth coloured and laughed as she (<font color='blue'><b>Elizabeth</b></font>) replied, <div class="bookquote">``Yes, you know enough
of my frankness to believe me capable of _that_. After abusing you so
abominably to your face, I could have no scruple in abusing you to all
your relations.''

 (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``What did you say of me, that I did not deserve? For, though your
accusations were ill-founded, formed on mistaken premises, my
behaviour to you at the time had merited the severest reproof. It was
unpardonable. I cannot think of it without abhorrence.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``We will not quarrel for the greater share of blame annexed to that
evening,''  (<font color='red'><b>Elizabeth/Miss Bennet/Miss Elizabeth</b></font>)</div>said Elizabeth. <div class="bookquote">``The conduct of neither, if strictly examined,
will be irreproachable; but since then, we have both, I hope, improved
in civility.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I cannot be so easily reconciled to myself. The recollection of what I
then said, of my conduct, my manners, my expressions during the whole of
it, is now, and has been many months, inexpressibly painful to me. Your
reproof, so well applied, I shall never forget: `had you behaved in a
more gentlemanlike manner.''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>Those were your words. You know not, you can
scarcely conceive, how they have tortured me;--though it was some time,
I confess, before I was reasonable enough to allow their justice.''

<p/><div class="bookquote">``I was certainly very far from expecting them to make so strong an
impression. I had not the smallest idea of their being ever felt in such
a way.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I can easily believe it. You thought me then devoid of every proper
feeling, I am sure you did. The turn of your countenance I shall never
forget, as you said that I could not have addressed you in any possible
way that would induce you to accept me.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Oh! do not repeat what I then said. These recollections will not do at
all. I assure you that I have long been most heartily ashamed of it.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Darcy/Darcy</b></font>)</div><p/>Darcy mentioned his (<font color='blue'><b>Darcy</b></font>) letter. <div class="bookquote">``Did it,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>said he (<font color='blue'><b>Darcy</b></font>), <div class="bookquote">``did it soon make you
think better of me? Did you, on reading it, give any credit to its
contents?''

 (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div><p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>Elizabeth</b></font>) explained what its effect on her (<font color='blue'><b>Elizabeth</b></font>) had been, and how gradually all her (<font color='blue'><b>Elizabeth</b></font>)
former prejudices had been removed.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``I knew,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>said he (<font color='blue'><b>Darcy</b></font>), <div class="bookquote">``that what I wrote must give you pain, but it was
necessary. I hope you have destroyed the letter. There was one part
especially, the opening of it, which I should dread your having the
power of reading again. I can remember some expressions which might
justly make you hate me.''

 (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``The letter shall certainly be burnt, if you believe it essential to the
preservation of my regard; but, though we have both reason to think my
opinions not entirely unalterable, they are not, I hope, quite so easily
changed as that implies.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``When I wrote that letter,''  (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Darcy/Darcy</b></font>)</div>replied Darcy, <div class="bookquote">``I believed myself perfectly
calm and cool, but I am since convinced that it was written in a
dreadful bitterness of spirit.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Darcy/Darcy</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``The letter, perhaps, began in bitterness, but it did not end so. The
adieu is charity itself. But think no more of the letter. The feelings
of the person who wrote, and the person who received it, are now
so widely different from what they were then, that every unpleasant
circumstance attending it ought to be forgotten. You must learn some
of my philosophy. Think only of the past as its remembrance gives you
pleasure.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I cannot give you credit for any philosophy of the kind. Your
retrospections must be so totally void of reproach, that the contentment
arising from them is not of philosophy, but, what is much better, of
innocence. But with me, it is not so. Painful recollections will intrude
which cannot, which ought not, to be repelled. I have been a selfish
being all my life, in practice, though not in principle. As a child I
was taught what was right, but I was not taught to correct my temper. I
was given good principles, but left to follow them in pride and conceit.
Unfortunately an only son -LRB-for many years an only child-RRB-, I was spoilt
by my parents, who, though good themselves -LRB-my father, particularly, all
that was benevolent and amiable-RRB-, allowed, encouraged, almost taught
me to be selfish and overbearing; to care for none beyond my own family
circle; to think meanly of all the rest of the world; to wish at least
to think meanly of their sense and worth compared with my own. Such I
was, from eight to eight and twenty; and such I might still have been
but for you, dearest, loveliest Elizabeth! What do I not owe you! You
taught me a lesson, hard indeed at first, but most advantageous. By you,
I was properly humbled. I came to you without a doubt of my reception.
You showed me how insufficient were all my pretensions to please a woman
worthy of being pleased.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Had you then persuaded yourself that I should?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Indeed I had. What will you think of my vanity? I believed you to be
wishing, expecting my addresses.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``My manners must have been in fault, but not intentionally, I assure
you. I never meant to deceive you, but my spirits might often lead me
wrong. How you must have hated me after _that_ evening?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Hate you! I was angry perhaps at first, but my anger soon began to take
a proper direction.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I am almost afraid of asking what you thought of me, when we met at
Pemberley. You blamed me for coming?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``No indeed; I felt nothing but surprise.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Your surprise could not be greater than _mine_ in being noticed by you.
My conscience told me that I deserved no extraordinary politeness, and I
confess that I did not expect to receive _more_ than my due.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``My object then,''  (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Darcy/Darcy</b></font>)</div>replied Darcy, <div class="bookquote">``was to show you, by every civility in
my power, that I was not so mean as to resent the past; and I hoped to
obtain your forgiveness, to lessen your ill opinion, by letting you
see that your reproofs had been attended to. How soon any other wishes
introduced themselves I can hardly tell, but I believe in about half an
hour after I had seen you.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Darcy/Darcy</b></font>)</div><p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Darcy</b></font>) then told her (<font color='blue'><b>Elizabeth</b></font>) of Georgiana's delight in her (<font color='blue'><b>Elizabeth</b></font>) acquaintance, and of her (<font color='blue'><b>Elizabeth</b></font>)
disappointment at its sudden interruption; which naturally leading to
the cause of that interruption, she (<font color='blue'><b>Elizabeth</b></font>) soon learnt that his (<font color='blue'><b>Darcy</b></font>) resolution of
following her (<font color='blue'><b>Elizabeth</b></font>) from Derbyshire in quest of her (<font color='blue'><b>Elizabeth</b></font>) sister had been formed
before he (<font color='blue'><b>Darcy</b></font>) quitted the inn, and that his (<font color='blue'><b>Darcy</b></font>) gravity and thoughtfulness
there had arisen from no other struggles than what such a purpose must
comprehend.

<p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>Elizabeth</b></font>) expressed her (<font color='blue'><b>Elizabeth</b></font>) gratitude again, but it was too painful a subject to
each, to be dwelt on farther.

<p/>After walking several miles in a leisurely manner, and too busy to know
anything about it, they found at last, on examining their watches, that
it was time to be at home.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``What could become of Mr. Bingley and Jane!''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>was a wonder which
introduced the discussion of their affairs. Darcy was delighted with
their engagement; his (<font color='blue'><b>Darcy</b></font>) friend had given him (<font color='blue'><b>Darcy</b></font>) the earliest information of
it.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``I must ask whether you were surprised?''  (<font color='red'><b>Elizabeth/Miss Bennet/Miss Elizabeth</b></font>)</div>said Elizabeth.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Not at all. When I went away, I felt that it would soon happen.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``That is to say, you had given your permission. I guessed as much.''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>And
though he (<font color='blue'><b>Darcy</b></font>) exclaimed at the term, she (<font color='blue'><b>Elizabeth</b></font>) found that it had been pretty much
the case.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``On the evening before my going to London,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>said he (<font color='blue'><b>Darcy</b></font>), <div class="bookquote">``I made a
confession to him (<font color='blue'><b>Bingley</b></font>), which I believe I ought to have made long ago. I
told him (<font color='blue'><b>Bingley</b></font>) of all that had occurred to make my former interference in his (<font color='blue'><b>Bingley</b></font>)
affairs absurd and impertinent. His (<font color='blue'><b>Bingley</b></font>) surprise was great. He (<font color='blue'><b>Bingley</b></font>) had never had
the slightest suspicion. I told him (<font color='blue'><b>Bingley</b></font>), moreover, that I believed myself
mistaken in supposing, as I had done, that your sister was indifferent
to him (<font color='blue'><b>Bingley</b></font>); and as I could easily perceive that his (<font color='blue'><b>Bingley</b></font>) attachment to her (<font color='blue'><b>sister</b></font>) was
unabated, I felt no doubt of their happiness together.''

 (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div><p/>Elizabeth could not help smiling at his (<font color='blue'><b>Darcy</b></font>) easy manner of directing his (<font color='blue'><b>Darcy</b></font>)
friend.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Did you speak from your own observation,''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>said she (<font color='blue'><b>Elizabeth</b></font>), <div class="bookquote">``when you told him (<font color='blue'><b>Bingley</b></font>)
that my sister loved him (<font color='blue'><b>Bingley</b></font>), or merely from my information last spring?''

 (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``From the former. I had narrowly observed her (<font color='blue'><b>sister</b></font>) during the two visits
which I had lately made here; and I was convinced of her (<font color='blue'><b>sister</b></font>) affection.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``And your assurance of it, I suppose, carried immediate conviction to
him (<font color='blue'><b>Bingley</b></font>).''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``It did. Bingley is most unaffectedly modest. His (<font color='blue'><b>Bingley</b></font>) diffidence had
prevented his (<font color='blue'><b>Bingley</b></font>) depending on his (<font color='blue'><b>Bingley</b></font>) own judgment in so anxious a case, but
his (<font color='blue'><b>Bingley</b></font>) reliance on mine made every thing easy. I was obliged to confess
one thing, which for a time, and not unjustly, offended him (<font color='blue'><b>Bingley</b></font>). I could not
allow myself to conceal that your sister had been in town three months
last winter, that I had known it, and purposely kept it from him (<font color='blue'><b>Bingley</b></font>). He (<font color='blue'><b>Bingley</b></font>) was
angry. But his (<font color='blue'><b>Bingley</b></font>) anger, I am persuaded, lasted no longer than he (<font color='blue'><b>Bingley</b></font>) remained
in any doubt of your sister's sentiments. He (<font color='blue'><b>Bingley</b></font>) has heartily forgiven me
now.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Elizabeth/Miss Bennet/Miss Elizabeth</b></font>)</div><p/>Elizabeth longed to observe that Mr. Bingley had been a most delightful
friend; so easily guided that his (<font color='blue'><b>Bingley</b></font>) worth was invaluable; but she (<font color='blue'><b>Elizabeth</b></font>) checked
herself. She (<font color='blue'><b>Elizabeth</b></font>) remembered that he (<font color='blue'><b>Bingley</b></font>) had yet to learn to be laughed at,
and it was rather too early to begin. In anticipating the happiness
of Bingley, which of course was to be inferior only to his (<font color='blue'><b>Bingley</b></font>) own, he (<font color='blue'><b>Bingley</b></font>)
continued the conversation till they reached the house. In the hall they
parted.



<p/>Chapter 59


<p/><div class="bookquote">``My dear Lizzy, where can you have been walking to?''  (<font color='red'><b>Elizabeth/Miss Bennet/Miss Elizabeth</b></font>)</div>was a question
which Elizabeth received from Jane as soon as she (<font color='blue'><b>Elizabeth</b></font>) entered their room,
and from all the others when they sat down to table. She (<font color='blue'><b>Elizabeth</b></font>) had only to
say in reply, that they had wandered about, till she (<font color='blue'><b>Elizabeth</b></font>) was beyond her (<font color='blue'><b>Elizabeth</b></font>) own
knowledge. She (<font color='blue'><b>Elizabeth</b></font>) coloured as she (<font color='blue'><b>Elizabeth</b></font>) spoke; but neither that, nor anything
else, awakened a suspicion of the truth.

<p/>The evening passed quietly, unmarked by anything extraordinary. The
acknowledged lovers talked and laughed, the unacknowledged were silent.
Darcy was not of a disposition in which happiness overflows in mirth;
and Elizabeth, agitated and confused, rather _knew_ that she (<font color='blue'><b>Elizabeth</b></font>) was happy
than _felt_ herself to be so; for, besides the immediate embarrassment,
there were other evils before her (<font color='blue'><b>Elizabeth</b></font>). She (<font color='blue'><b>Elizabeth</b></font>) anticipated what would be felt
in the family when her (<font color='blue'><b>Elizabeth</b></font>) situation became known; she (<font color='blue'><b>Elizabeth</b></font>) was aware that no
one liked him (<font color='blue'><b>Darcy</b></font>) but Jane; and even feared that with the others it was a
dislike which not all his (<font color='blue'><b>Darcy</b></font>) fortune and consequence might do away.

<p/>At night she (<font color='blue'><b>Jane</b></font>) opened her (<font color='blue'><b>Jane</b></font>) heart to Jane. Though suspicion was very far
from Miss Bennet's general habits, she (<font color='blue'><b>Bennet</b></font>) was absolutely incredulous here.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``You are joking, Lizzy. This cannot be!--engaged to Mr. Darcy! No, no,
you shall not deceive me. I know it to be impossible.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``This is a wretched beginning indeed! My sole dependence was on you; and
I am sure nobody else will believe me, if you do not. Yet, indeed, I am
in earnest. I speak nothing but the truth. He (<font color='blue'><b>Darcy</b></font>) still loves me, and we are
engaged.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Jane</b></font>)</div><p/>Jane looked at her (<font color='blue'><b>Jane</b></font>) doubtingly. <div class="bookquote">``Oh, Lizzy! it cannot be. I know how much
you dislike him (<font color='blue'><b>Darcy</b></font>).''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``You know nothing of the matter. _That_ is all to be forgot. Perhaps I
did not always love him (<font color='blue'><b>Darcy</b></font>) so well as I do now. But in such cases as
these, a good memory is unpardonable. This is the last time I shall ever
remember it myself.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Elizabeth/Miss Bennet/Miss Elizabeth</b></font>)</div><p/>Miss Bennet still looked all amazement. Elizabeth again, and more
seriously assured her (<font color='blue'><b>Elizabeth</b></font>) of its truth.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Good Heaven! can it be really so! Yet now I must believe you,''  (<font color='red'><b>Jane</b></font>)</div>cried
Jane. <div class="bookquote">``My dear, dear Lizzy, I would--I do congratulate you--but are you
certain? forgive the question--are you quite certain that you can be
happy with him (<font color='blue'><b>Darcy</b></font>)?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``There can be no doubt of that. It is settled between us already, that
we are to be the happiest couple in the world. But are you pleased,
Jane? Shall you like to have such a brother?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Very, very much. Nothing could give either Bingley or myself more
delight. But we considered it, we talked of it as impossible. And do you
really love him (<font color='blue'><b>Bingley</b></font>) quite well enough? Oh, Lizzy! do anything rather than
marry without affection. Are you quite sure that you feel what you ought
to do?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Oh, yes! You will only think I feel _more_ than I ought to do, when I
tell you all.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``What do you mean?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Why, I must confess that I love him (<font color='blue'><b>Bingley</b></font>) better than I do Bingley. I am
afraid you will be angry.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``My dearest sister, now _be_ serious. I want to talk very seriously. Let
me know every thing that I am to know, without delay. Will you tell me
how long you have loved him (<font color='blue'><b>Bingley</b></font>)?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``It has been coming on so gradually, that I hardly know when it began.
But I believe I must date it from my first seeing his (<font color='blue'><b>Bingley</b></font>) beautiful grounds
at Pemberley.''

 (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div><p/>Another entreaty that she (<font color='blue'><b>Jane</b></font>) would be serious, however, produced the
desired effect; and she (<font color='blue'><b>Jane</b></font>) soon satisfied Jane by her (<font color='blue'><b>Jane</b></font>) solemn assurances
of attachment. When convinced on that article, Miss Bennet had nothing
further to wish.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Now I am quite happy,''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>said she (<font color='blue'><b>Bennet</b></font>), <div class="bookquote">``for you will be as happy as myself.
I always had a value for him (<font color='blue'><b>Bingley</b></font>). Were it for nothing but his (<font color='blue'><b>Bingley</b></font>) love of you,
I must always have esteemed him (<font color='blue'><b>Bingley</b></font>); but now, as Bingley's friend and your
husband, there can be only Bingley and yourself more dear to me. But
Lizzy, you have been very sly, very reserved with me. How little did you
tell me of what passed at Pemberley and Lambton! I owe all that I know
of it to another, not to you.''

 (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div><p/>Elizabeth told her (<font color='blue'><b>Elizabeth</b></font>) the motives of her (<font color='blue'><b>Elizabeth</b></font>) secrecy. She (<font color='blue'><b>Elizabeth</b></font>) had been unwilling
to mention Bingley; and the unsettled state of her (<font color='blue'><b>Elizabeth</b></font>) own feelings had made
her (<font color='blue'><b>Elizabeth</b></font>) equally avoid the name of his (<font color='blue'><b>Elizabeth</b></font>) friend. But now she (<font color='blue'><b>Elizabeth</b></font>) would no longer
conceal from her (<font color='blue'><b>Elizabeth</b></font>) his (<font color='blue'><b>Elizabeth</b></font>) share in Lydia's marriage. All was acknowledged,
and half the night spent in conversation.

<p/>* * * * *

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Good gracious!''  (<font color='red'><b>Mrs. Bennet</b></font>)</div>cried Mrs. Bennet, as she (<font color='blue'><b>Bennet</b></font>) stood at a window the next
morning, <div class="bookquote">``if that disagreeable Mr. Darcy is not coming here again with
our dear Bingley! What can he (<font color='blue'><b>Darcy</b></font>) mean by being so tiresome as to be always
coming here? I had no notion but he (<font color='blue'><b>Darcy</b></font>) would go a-shooting, or something or
other, and not disturb us with his (<font color='blue'><b>Darcy</b></font>) company. What shall we do with him (<font color='blue'><b>Darcy</b></font>)?
Lizzy, you must walk out with him (<font color='blue'><b>Darcy</b></font>) again, that he (<font color='blue'><b>Darcy</b></font>) may not be in Bingley's
way.''

 (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div><p/>Elizabeth could hardly help laughing at so convenient a proposal; yet
was really vexed that her (<font color='blue'><b>Elizabeth</b></font>) mother should be always giving him (<font color='blue'><b>Elizabeth</b></font>) such an
epithet.

<p/>As soon as they entered, Bingley looked at her (<font color='blue'><b>Elizabeth</b></font>) so expressively, and
shook hands with such warmth, as left no doubt of his (<font color='blue'><b>Bingley</b></font>) good information;
and he (<font color='blue'><b>Bingley</b></font>) soon afterwards said aloud, <div class="bookquote">``Mrs. Bennet, have you no more lanes
hereabouts in which Lizzy may lose her (<font color='blue'><b>Lizzy</b></font>) way again to-day?''

 (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I advise Mr. Darcy, and Lizzy, and Kitty,''  (<font color='red'><b>Mrs. Bennet</b></font>)</div>said Mrs. Bennet, <div class="bookquote">``to walk
to Oakham Mount this morning. It is a nice long walk, and Mr. Darcy has
never seen the view.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Mrs. Bennet</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``It may do very well for the others,''  (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Bingley/Bingley</b></font>)</div>replied Mr. Bingley; <div class="bookquote">``but I am
sure it will be too much for Kitty. Won't it, Kitty?''  (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Bingley/Bingley</b></font>)</div>Kitty owned that
she (<font color='blue'><b>Bennet</b></font>) had rather stay at home. Darcy professed a great curiosity to see
the view from the Mount, and Elizabeth silently consented. As she (<font color='blue'><b>Elizabeth</b></font>) went
up stairs to get ready, Mrs. Bennet followed her (<font color='blue'><b>Bennet</b></font>), saying:

<p/><div class="bookquote">``I am quite sorry, Lizzy, that you should be forced to have that
disagreeable man all to yourself. But I hope you will not mind it: it is
all for Jane's sake, you know; and there is no occasion for talking
to him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>), except just now and then. So, do not put yourself to
inconvenience.''

 (<font color='red'><b>her</b></font>)</div><p/>During their walk, it was resolved that Mr. Bennet's consent should be
asked in the course of the evening. Elizabeth reserved to herself the
application for her (<font color='blue'><b>Elizabeth</b></font>) mother's. She (<font color='blue'><b>Elizabeth</b></font>) could not determine how her (<font color='blue'><b>Elizabeth</b></font>) mother
would take it; sometimes doubting whether all his (<font color='blue'><b>Bennet</b></font>) wealth and grandeur
would be enough to overcome her (<font color='blue'><b>Elizabeth</b></font>) abhorrence of the man. But whether she (<font color='blue'><b>Elizabeth</b></font>)
were violently set against the match, or violently delighted with it, it
was certain that her (<font color='blue'><b>Elizabeth</b></font>) manner would be equally ill adapted to do credit
to her (<font color='blue'><b>Elizabeth</b></font>) sense; and she (<font color='blue'><b>Elizabeth</b></font>) could no more bear that Mr. Darcy should hear
the first raptures of her (<font color='blue'><b>Elizabeth</b></font>) joy, than the first vehemence of her (<font color='blue'><b>Elizabeth</b></font>)
disapprobation.

<p/>* * * * *

<p/>In the evening, soon after Mr. Bennet withdrew to the library, she (<font color='blue'><b>Elizabeth</b></font>) saw
Mr. Darcy rise also and follow him (<font color='blue'><b>Darcy</b></font>), and her (<font color='blue'><b>Elizabeth</b></font>) agitation on seeing it was
extreme. She (<font color='blue'><b>Elizabeth</b></font>) did not fear her (<font color='blue'><b>Elizabeth</b></font>) father's opposition, but he (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) was going to
be made unhappy; and that it should be through her (<font color='blue'><b>Elizabeth</b></font>) means--that _she (<font color='blue'><b>Elizabeth</b></font>)_,
his (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) favourite child, should be distressing him (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) by her (<font color='blue'><b>Elizabeth</b></font>) choice, should be
filling him (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) with fears and regrets in disposing of her (<font color='blue'><b>Elizabeth</b></font>)--was a wretched
reflection, and she (<font color='blue'><b>Elizabeth</b></font>) sat in misery till Mr. Darcy appeared again, when,
looking at him (<font color='blue'><b>Darcy</b></font>), she (<font color='blue'><b>Elizabeth</b></font>) was a little relieved by his (<font color='blue'><b>Darcy</b></font>) smile. In a few minutes
he (<font color='blue'><b>Darcy</b></font>) approached the table where she (<font color='blue'><b>Elizabeth</b></font>) was sitting with Kitty; and, while
pretending to admire her (<font color='blue'><b>Elizabeth</b></font>) work said in a whisper, <div class="bookquote">``Go to your father, he (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>)
wants you in the library.''  (<font color='red'><b>Kitty</b></font>)</div>She (<font color='blue'><b>Elizabeth</b></font>) was gone directly.

<p/>Her (<font color='blue'><b>Elizabeth</b></font>) father was walking about the room, looking grave and anxious.
<div class="bookquote">``Lizzy,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>said he (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>), <div class="bookquote">``what are you doing? Are you out of your senses, to be
accepting this man? Have not you always hated him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>)?''

 (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div><p/>How earnestly did she (<font color='blue'><b>Elizabeth</b></font>) then wish that her (<font color='blue'><b>Elizabeth</b></font>) former opinions had been more
reasonable, her (<font color='blue'><b>Elizabeth</b></font>) expressions more moderate! It would have spared her (<font color='blue'><b>Elizabeth</b></font>) from
explanations and professions which it was exceedingly awkward to give;
but they were now necessary, and she (<font color='blue'><b>Elizabeth</b></font>) assured him (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>), with some confusion,
of her (<font color='blue'><b>Elizabeth</b></font>) attachment to Mr. Darcy.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Or, in other words, you are determined to have him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>). He (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) is rich, to be
sure, and you may have more fine clothes and fine carriages than Jane.
But will they make you happy?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Have you any other objection,''  (<font color='red'><b>Elizabeth/Miss Bennet/Miss Elizabeth</b></font>)</div>said Elizabeth, <div class="bookquote">``than your belief of my
indifference?''

 (<font color='red'><b>Elizabeth/Miss Bennet/Miss Elizabeth</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``None at all. We all know him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) to be a proud, unpleasant sort of man; but
this would be nothing if you really liked him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>).''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I do, I do like him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>),''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Elizabeth</b></font>) replied, with tears in her (<font color='blue'><b>Elizabeth</b></font>) eyes, <div class="bookquote">``I love him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>).
Indeed he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) has no improper pride. He (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) is perfectly amiable. You do not
know what he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) really is; then pray do not pain me by speaking of him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) in
such terms.''

 (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Lizzy,''  (<font color='red'><b>father</b></font>)</div>said her (<font color='blue'><b>Elizabeth</b></font>) father, <div class="bookquote">``I have given him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) my consent. He (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) is the kind
of man, indeed, to whom I should never dare refuse anything, which he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>)
condescended to ask. I now give it to _you_, if you are resolved on
having him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>). But let me advise you to think better of it. I know
your disposition, Lizzy. I know that you could be neither happy nor
respectable, unless you truly esteemed your husband; unless you looked
up to him (<font color='blue'><b>husband</b></font>) as a superior. Your lively talents would place you in the
greatest danger in an unequal marriage. You could scarcely escape
discredit and misery. My child, let me not have the grief of seeing
_you_ unable to respect your partner in life. You know not what you are
about.''

 (<font color='red'><b>father</b></font>)</div><p/>Elizabeth, still more affected, was earnest and solemn in her (<font color='blue'><b>Elizabeth</b></font>) reply; and
at length, by repeated assurances that Mr. Darcy was really the object
of her (<font color='blue'><b>Elizabeth</b></font>) choice, by explaining the gradual change which her (<font color='blue'><b>Elizabeth</b></font>) estimation of
him (<font color='blue'><b>Darcy</b></font>) had undergone, relating her (<font color='blue'><b>Elizabeth</b></font>) absolute certainty that his (<font color='blue'><b>Darcy</b></font>) affection
was not the work of a day, but had stood the test of many months'
suspense, and enumerating with energy all his (<font color='blue'><b>Darcy</b></font>) good qualities, she (<font color='blue'><b>Elizabeth</b></font>) did
conquer her (<font color='blue'><b>Elizabeth</b></font>) father's incredulity, and reconcile him (<font color='blue'><b>Darcy</b></font>) to the match.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Well, my dear,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>said he (<font color='blue'><b>Darcy</b></font>), when she (<font color='blue'><b>Elizabeth</b></font>) ceased speaking, <div class="bookquote">``I have no more to
say. If this be the case, he (<font color='blue'><b>husband</b></font>) deserves you. I could not have parted with
you, my Lizzy, to anyone less worthy.''

 (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div><p/>To complete the favourable impression, she (<font color='blue'><b>Elizabeth</b></font>) then told him (<font color='blue'><b>Darcy</b></font>) what Mr. Darcy
had voluntarily done for Lydia. He (<font color='blue'><b>Darcy</b></font>) heard her (<font color='blue'><b>Lydia</b></font>) with astonishment.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``This is an evening of wonders, indeed! And so, Darcy did every thing;
made up the match, gave the money, paid the fellow's debts, and got him (<font color='blue'><b>Darcy</b></font>)
his (<font color='blue'><b>Darcy</b></font>) commission! So much the better. It will save me a world of trouble
and economy. Had it been your uncle's doing, I must and _would_ have
paid him (<font color='blue'><b>uncle</b></font>); but these violent young lovers carry every thing their own
way. I shall offer to pay him (<font color='blue'><b>uncle</b></font>) to-morrow; he (<font color='blue'><b>uncle</b></font>) will rant and storm about
his (<font color='blue'><b>uncle</b></font>) love for you, and there will be an end of the matter.''

 (<font color='red'><b>He</b></font>)</div><p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Darcy</b></font>) then recollected her (<font color='blue'><b>Lydia</b></font>) embarrassment a few days before, on his (<font color='blue'><b>Darcy</b></font>) reading
Mr. Collins's letter; and after laughing at her (<font color='blue'><b>Lydia</b></font>) some time, allowed her (<font color='blue'><b>Lydia</b></font>)
at last to go--saying, as she (<font color='blue'><b>Lydia</b></font>) quitted the room, <div class="bookquote">``If any young men come
for Mary or Kitty, send them in, for I am quite at leisure.''

 (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div><p/>Elizabeth's mind was now relieved from a very heavy weight; and, after
half an hour's quiet reflection in her (<font color='blue'><b>Elizabeth</b></font>) own room, she (<font color='blue'><b>Elizabeth</b></font>) was able to join
the others with tolerable composure. Every thing was too recent for
gaiety, but the evening passed tranquilly away; there was no longer
anything material to be dreaded, and the comfort of ease and familiarity
would come in time.

<p/>When her (<font color='blue'><b>Elizabeth</b></font>) mother went up to her (<font color='blue'><b>Elizabeth</b></font>) dressing-room at night, she (<font color='blue'><b>Elizabeth</b></font>) followed her (<font color='blue'><b>Elizabeth</b></font>),
and made the important communication. Its effect was most extraordinary;
for on first hearing it, Mrs. Bennet sat quite still, and unable to
utter a syllable. Nor was it under many, many minutes that she (<font color='blue'><b>Bennet</b></font>) could
comprehend what she (<font color='blue'><b>Bennet</b></font>) heard; though not in general backward to credit
what was for the advantage of her (<font color='blue'><b>Bennet</b></font>) family, or that came in the shape of a
lover to any of them. She (<font color='blue'><b>Bennet</b></font>) began at length to recover, to fidget about in
her (<font color='blue'><b>Bennet</b></font>) chair, get up, sit down again, wonder, and bless herself.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Good gracious! Lord bless me! only think! dear me! Mr. Darcy! Who would
have thought it! And is it really true? Oh! my sweetest Lizzy! how rich
and how great you will be! What pin-money, what jewels, what carriages
you will have! Jane's is nothing to it--nothing at all. I am so
pleased--so happy. Such a charming man!--so handsome! so tall!--Oh, my
dear Lizzy! pray apologise for my having disliked him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) so much before. I
hope he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) will overlook it. Dear, dear Lizzy. A house in town! Every thing
that is charming! Three daughters married! Ten thousand a year! Oh,
Lord! What will become of me. I shall go distracted.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/>This was enough to prove that her (<font color='blue'><b>Bennet</b></font>) approbation need not be doubted: and
Elizabeth, rejoicing that such an effusion was heard only by herself,
soon went away. But before she (<font color='blue'><b>Elizabeth</b></font>) had been three minutes in her (<font color='blue'><b>Elizabeth</b></font>) own room,
her (<font color='blue'><b>Elizabeth</b></font>) mother followed her (<font color='blue'><b>Elizabeth</b></font>).

<p/><div class="bookquote">``My dearest child,''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Elizabeth</b></font>) cried, ``I can think of nothing else! Ten
thousand a year, and very likely more! <div class="bookquote">``Tis as good as a Lord! And a
special licence. You must and shall be married by a special licence. But
my dearest love, tell me what dish Mr. Darcy is particularly fond of,
that I may have it to-morrow.''

 (<font color='red'><b>mother</b></font>)</div><p/>This was a sad omen of what her (<font color='blue'><b>Elizabeth</b></font>) mother's behaviour to the gentleman
himself might be; and Elizabeth found that, though in the certain
possession of his (<font color='blue'><b>gentleman</b></font>) warmest affection, and secure of her (<font color='blue'><b>Elizabeth</b></font>) relations'
consent, there was still something to be wished for. But the morrow
passed off much better than she (<font color='blue'><b>Elizabeth</b></font>) expected; for Mrs. Bennet luckily stood
in such awe of her (<font color='blue'><b>Bennet</b></font>) intended son-in-law that she (<font color='blue'><b>Bennet</b></font>) ventured not to speak to
him (<font color='blue'><b>son-in-law</b></font>), unless it was in her (<font color='blue'><b>Bennet</b></font>) power to offer him (<font color='blue'><b>son-in-law</b></font>) any attention, or mark her (<font color='blue'><b>Bennet</b></font>)
deference for his (<font color='blue'><b>son-in-law</b></font>) opinion.

<p/>Elizabeth had the satisfaction of seeing her (<font color='blue'><b>Elizabeth</b></font>) father taking pains to get
acquainted with him (<font color='blue'><b>son-in-law</b></font>); and Mr. Bennet soon assured her (<font color='blue'><b>Elizabeth</b></font>) that he (<font color='blue'><b>Bennet</b></font>) was rising
every hour in his (<font color='blue'><b>Bennet</b></font>) esteem.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``I admire all my three sons-in-law highly,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>said he (<font color='blue'><b>Bennet</b></font>). <div class="bookquote">``Wickham, perhaps,
is my favourite; but I think I shall like _your_ husband quite as well
as Jane's.''



 (<font color='red'><b>Elizabeth/Miss Bennet/Miss Elizabeth</b></font>)</div><p/>Chapter 60


<p/>Elizabeth's spirits soon rising to playfulness again, she (<font color='blue'><b>Elizabeth</b></font>) wanted Mr.
Darcy to account for his (<font color='blue'><b>Darcy</b></font>) having ever fallen in love with her (<font color='blue'><b>Elizabeth</b></font>). <div class="bookquote">``How could
you begin?''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>said she (<font color='blue'><b>Elizabeth</b></font>). <div class="bookquote">``I can comprehend your going on charmingly, when
you had once made a beginning; but what could set you off in the first
place?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I cannot fix on the hour, or the spot, or the look, or the words, which
laid the foundation. It is too long ago. I was in the middle before I
knew that I _had_ begun.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``My beauty you had early withstood, and as for my manners--my behaviour
to _you_ was at least always bordering on the uncivil, and I never spoke
to you without rather wishing to give you pain than not. Now be sincere;
did you admire me for my impertinence?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``For the liveliness of your mind, I did.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``You may as well call it impertinence at once. It was very little less.
The fact is, that you were sick of civility, of deference, of officious
attention. You were disgusted with the women who were always speaking,
and looking, and thinking for _your_ approbation alone. I roused, and
interested you, because I was so unlike _them_. Had you not been really
amiable, you would have hated me for it; but in spite of the pains you
took to disguise yourself, your feelings were always noble and just; and
in your heart, you thoroughly despised the persons who so assiduously
courted you. There--I have saved you the trouble of accounting for
it; and really, all things considered, I begin to think it perfectly
reasonable. To be sure, you knew no actual good of me--but nobody thinks
of _that_ when they fall in love.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Was there no good in your affectionate behaviour to Jane while she (<font color='blue'><b>Jane</b></font>) was
ill at Netherfield?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Dearest Jane! who could have done less for her (<font color='blue'><b>Jane</b></font>)? But make a virtue of it
by all means. My good qualities are under your protection, and you are
to exaggerate them as much as possible; and, in return, it belongs to me
to find occasions for teasing and quarrelling with you as often as may
be; and I shall begin directly by asking you what made you so unwilling
to come to the point at last. What made you so shy of me, when you first
called, and afterwards dined here? Why, especially, when you called, did
you look as if you did not care about me?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Because you were grave and silent, and gave me no encouragement.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``But I was embarrassed.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``And so was I.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``You might have talked to me more when you came to dinner.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``A man who had felt less, might.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``How unlucky that you should have a reasonable answer to give, and that
I should be so reasonable as to admit it! But I wonder how long you
_would_ have gone on, if you had been left to yourself. I wonder when
you _would_ have spoken, if I had not asked you! My resolution of
thanking you for your kindness to Lydia had certainly great effect.
_Too much_, I am afraid; for what becomes of the moral, if our comfort
springs from a breach of promise? for I ought not to have mentioned the
subject. This will never do.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``You need not distress yourself. The moral will be perfectly fair. Lady
Catherine's unjustifiable endeavours to separate us were the means of
removing all my doubts. I am not indebted for my present happiness to
your eager desire of expressing your gratitude. I was not in a humour
to wait for any opening of yours. My aunt's intelligence had given me
hope, and I was determined at once to know every thing.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Lady Catherine has been of infinite use, which ought to make her (<font color='blue'><b>Catherine</b></font>) happy,
for she (<font color='blue'><b>Catherine</b></font>) loves to be of use. But tell me, what did you come down to
Netherfield for? Was it merely to ride to Longbourn and be embarrassed?
or had you intended any more serious consequence?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``My real purpose was to see _you_, and to judge, if I could, whether I
might ever hope to make you love me. My avowed one, or what I avowed to
myself, was to see whether your sister were still partial to Bingley,
and if she (<font color='blue'><b>sister</b></font>) were, to make the confession to him (<font color='blue'><b>My</b></font>) which I have since made.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Shall you ever have courage to announce to Lady Catherine what is to
befall her (<font color='blue'><b>Catherine</b></font>)?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I am more likely to want more time than courage, Elizabeth. But it
ought to be done, and if you will give me a sheet of paper, it shall be
done directly.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``And if I had not a letter to write myself, I might sit by you and
admire the evenness of your writing, as another young lady once did. But
I have an aunt, too, who must not be longer neglected.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Darcy/Darcy</b></font>)</div><p/>From an unwillingness to confess how much her (<font color='blue'><b>Elizabeth</b></font>) intimacy with Mr. Darcy
had been over-rated, Elizabeth had never yet answered Mrs. Gardiner's
long letter; but now, having _that_ to communicate which she (<font color='blue'><b>Elizabeth</b></font>) knew would
be most welcome, she (<font color='blue'><b>Elizabeth</b></font>) was almost ashamed to find that her (<font color='blue'><b>Elizabeth</b></font>) uncle and
aunt had already lost three days of happiness, and immediately wrote as
follows:

<p/><div class="bookquote">``I would have thanked you before, my dear aunt, as I ought to have done,
for your long, kind, satisfactory, detail of particulars; but to say the
truth, I was too cross to write. You supposed more than really existed.
But _now_ suppose as much as you choose; give a loose rein to your
fancy, indulge your imagination in every possible flight which the
subject will afford, and unless you believe me actually married, you
cannot greatly err. You must write again very soon, and praise him (<font color='blue'><b>I</b></font>) a
great deal more than you did in your last. I thank you, again and again,
for not going to the Lakes. How could I be so silly as to wish it! Your
idea of the ponies is delightful. We will go round the Park every day. I
am the happiest creature in the world. Perhaps other people have said so
before, but not one with such justice. I am happier even than Jane; she (<font color='blue'><b>Jane</b></font>)
only smiles, I laugh. Mr. Darcy sends you all the love in the world that
he (<font color='blue'><b>Darcy</b></font>) can spare from me. You are all to come to Pemberley at Christmas.
Yours, etc.''

 (<font color='red'><b>aunt</b></font>)</div><p/>Mr. Darcy's letter to Lady Catherine was in a different style; and still
different from either was what Mr. Bennet sent to Mr. Collins, in reply
to his (<font color='blue'><b>Bennet</b></font>) last.

<p/>``DEAR SIR,

<p/>``I must trouble you once more for congratulations. Elizabeth will soon
be the wife of Mr. Darcy. Console Lady Catherine as well as you can.
But, if I were you, I would stand by the nephew. He (<font color='blue'><b>nephew</b></font>) has more to give.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Yours sincerely, etc.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Miss Bingley</b></font>)</div><p/>Miss Bingley's congratulations to her (<font color='blue'><b>Bingley</b></font>) brother, on his (<font color='blue'><b>Bennet</b></font>) approaching
marriage, were all that was affectionate and insincere. She (<font color='blue'><b>Bingley</b></font>) wrote even
to Jane on the occasion, to express her (<font color='blue'><b>Bingley</b></font>) delight, and repeat all her (<font color='blue'><b>Bingley</b></font>)
former professions of regard. Jane was not deceived, but she (<font color='blue'><b>Jane</b></font>) was
affected; and though feeling no reliance on her (<font color='blue'><b>Jane</b></font>), could not help writing
her (<font color='blue'><b>Jane</b></font>) a much kinder answer than she (<font color='blue'><b>Jane</b></font>) knew was deserved.

<p/>The joy which Miss Darcy expressed on receiving similar information,
was as sincere as her (<font color='blue'><b>Darcy</b></font>) brother's in sending it. Four sides of paper were
insufficient to contain all her (<font color='blue'><b>Darcy</b></font>) delight, and all her (<font color='blue'><b>Darcy</b></font>) earnest desire of
being loved by her (<font color='blue'><b>Darcy</b></font>) sister.

<p/>Before any answer could arrive from Mr. Collins, or any congratulations
to Elizabeth from his (<font color='blue'><b>Collins</b></font>) wife, the Longbourn family heard that the
Collinses were come themselves to Lucas Lodge. The reason of this
sudden removal was soon evident. Lady Catherine had been rendered
so exceedingly angry by the contents of her (<font color='blue'><b>Catherine</b></font>) nephew's letter, that
Charlotte, really rejoicing in the match, was anxious to get away till
the storm was blown over. At such a moment, the arrival of her (<font color='blue'><b>Charlotte</b></font>) friend
was a sincere pleasure to Elizabeth, though in the course of their
meetings she (<font color='blue'><b>Elizabeth</b></font>) must sometimes think the pleasure dearly bought, when she (<font color='blue'><b>Elizabeth</b></font>)
saw Mr. Darcy exposed to all the parading and obsequious civility of
her (<font color='blue'><b>Elizabeth</b></font>) husband. He (<font color='blue'><b>Darcy</b></font>) bore it, however, with admirable calmness. He (<font color='blue'><b>Darcy</b></font>) could even
listen to Sir William Lucas, when he (<font color='blue'><b>Lucas</b></font>) complimented him (<font color='blue'><b>Lucas</b></font>) on carrying away
the brightest jewel of the country, and expressed his (<font color='blue'><b>Lucas</b></font>) hopes of their all
meeting frequently at St. James's, with very decent composure. If he (<font color='blue'><b>James</b></font>) did
shrug his (<font color='blue'><b>James</b></font>) shoulders, it was not till Sir William was out of sight.

<p/>Mrs. Phillips's vulgarity was another, and perhaps a greater, tax on his (<font color='blue'><b>William</b></font>)
forbearance; and though Mrs. Phillips, as well as her (<font color='blue'><b>Phillips</b></font>) sister, stood in
too much awe of him (<font color='blue'><b>William</b></font>) to speak with the familiarity which Bingley's good
humour encouraged, yet, whenever she (<font color='blue'><b>Phillips</b></font>) _did_ speak, she (<font color='blue'><b>Phillips</b></font>) must be vulgar.
Nor was her (<font color='blue'><b>Phillips</b></font>) respect for him (<font color='blue'><b>Bingley</b></font>), though it made her (<font color='blue'><b>Phillips</b></font>) more quiet, at all
likely to make her (<font color='blue'><b>Phillips</b></font>) more elegant. Elizabeth did all she (<font color='blue'><b>Elizabeth</b></font>) could to shield
him (<font color='blue'><b>Bingley</b></font>) from the frequent notice of either, and was ever anxious to keep
him (<font color='blue'><b>Bingley</b></font>) to herself, and to those of her (<font color='blue'><b>Elizabeth</b></font>) family with whom he (<font color='blue'><b>Bingley</b></font>) might converse
without mortification; and though the uncomfortable feelings arising
from all this took from the season of courtship much of its pleasure, it
added to the hope of the future; and she (<font color='blue'><b>Elizabeth</b></font>) looked forward with delight to
the time when they should be removed from society so little pleasing
to either, to all the comfort and elegance of their family party at
Pemberley.



<p/>Chapter 61


<p/>Happy for all her (<font color='blue'><b>Elizabeth</b></font>) maternal feelings was the day on which Mrs. Bennet got
rid of her (<font color='blue'><b>Bennet</b></font>) two most deserving daughters. With what delighted pride
she (<font color='blue'><b>Bennet</b></font>) afterwards visited Mrs. Bingley, and talked of Mrs. Darcy, may
be guessed. I wish I could say, for the sake of her (<font color='blue'><b>Darcy</b></font>) family, that the
accomplishment of her (<font color='blue'><b>Darcy</b></font>) earnest desire in the establishment of so many
of her (<font color='blue'><b>Darcy</b></font>) children produced so happy an effect as to make her (<font color='blue'><b>Darcy</b></font>) a sensible,
amiable, well-informed woman for the rest of her (<font color='blue'><b>Darcy</b></font>) life; though perhaps it
was lucky for her (<font color='blue'><b>Darcy</b></font>) husband, who might not have relished domestic felicity
in so unusual a form, that she (<font color='blue'><b>Darcy</b></font>) still was occasionally nervous and
invariably silly.

<p/>Mr. Bennet missed his (<font color='blue'><b>Bennet</b></font>) second daughter exceedingly; his (<font color='blue'><b>Bennet</b></font>) affection for her (<font color='blue'><b>daughter</b></font>)
drew him (<font color='blue'><b>Bennet</b></font>) oftener from home than anything else could do. He (<font color='blue'><b>Bennet</b></font>) delighted in
going to Pemberley, especially when he (<font color='blue'><b>Bennet</b></font>) was least expected.

<p/>Mr. Bingley and Jane remained at Netherfield only a twelvemonth. So near
a vicinity to her (<font color='blue'><b>Jane</b></font>) mother and Meryton relations was not desirable even to
_his (<font color='blue'><b>Bingley</b></font>)_ easy temper, or _her (<font color='blue'><b>Jane</b></font>)_ affectionate heart. The darling wish of his (<font color='blue'><b>Bingley</b></font>)
sisters was then gratified; he (<font color='blue'><b>Bingley</b></font>) bought an estate in a neighbouring county
to Derbyshire, and Jane and Elizabeth, in addition to every other source
of happiness, were within thirty miles of each other.

<p/>Kitty, to her (<font color='blue'><b>Kitty</b></font>) very material advantage, spent the chief of her (<font color='blue'><b>Kitty</b></font>) time with
her (<font color='blue'><b>Kitty</b></font>) two elder sisters. In society so superior to what she (<font color='blue'><b>Kitty</b></font>) had generally
known, her (<font color='blue'><b>Kitty</b></font>) improvement was great. She (<font color='blue'><b>Kitty</b></font>) was not of so ungovernable a
temper as Lydia; and, removed from the influence of Lydia's example,
she (<font color='blue'><b>Lydia</b></font>) became, by proper attention and management, less irritable, less
ignorant, and less insipid. From the further disadvantage of Lydia's
society she (<font color='blue'><b>Lydia</b></font>) was of course carefully kept, and though Mrs. Wickham
frequently invited her (<font color='blue'><b>Wickham</b></font>) to come and stay with her (<font color='blue'><b>Wickham</b></font>), with the promise of
balls and young men, her (<font color='blue'><b>Wickham</b></font>) father would never consent to her (<font color='blue'><b>Wickham</b></font>) going.

<p/>Mary was the only daughter who remained at home; and she (<font color='blue'><b>Mary</b></font>) was necessarily
drawn from the pursuit of accomplishments by Mrs. Bennet's being quite
unable to sit alone. Mary was obliged to mix more with the world, but
she (<font color='blue'><b>Mary</b></font>) could still moralize over every morning visit; and as she (<font color='blue'><b>Mary</b></font>) was no
longer mortified by comparisons between her (<font color='blue'><b>Mary</b></font>) sisters' beauty and her (<font color='blue'><b>Mary</b></font>) own,
it was suspected by her (<font color='blue'><b>Mary</b></font>) father that she (<font color='blue'><b>Mary</b></font>) submitted to the change without
much reluctance.

<p/>As for Wickham and Lydia, their characters suffered no revolution from
the marriage of her (<font color='blue'><b>Lydia</b></font>) sisters. He (<font color='blue'><b>Wickham</b></font>) bore with philosophy the conviction that
Elizabeth must now become acquainted with whatever of his (<font color='blue'><b>Wickham</b></font>) ingratitude
and falsehood had before been unknown to her (<font color='blue'><b>Elizabeth</b></font>); and in spite of every
thing, was not wholly without hope that Darcy might yet be prevailed on
to make his (<font color='blue'><b>Darcy</b></font>) fortune. The congratulatory letter which Elizabeth received
from Lydia on her (<font color='blue'><b>Elizabeth</b></font>) marriage, explained to her (<font color='blue'><b>Elizabeth</b></font>) that, by his (<font color='blue'><b>Darcy</b></font>) wife at least,
if not by himself, such a hope was cherished. The letter was to this
effect:

<p/>``MY DEAR LIZZY,

<p/>``I wish you joy. If you love Mr. Darcy half as well as I do my dear
Wickham, you must be very happy. It is a great comfort to have you so
rich, and when you have nothing else to do, I hope you will think of us.
I am sure Wickham would like a place at court very much, and I do not
think we shall have quite money enough to live upon without some help.
Any place would do, of about three or four hundred a year; but however,
do not speak to Mr. Darcy about it, if you had rather not.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Yours, etc.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Elizabeth/Miss Bennet/Miss Elizabeth</b></font>)</div><p/>As it happened that Elizabeth had _much_ rather not, she (<font color='blue'><b>Elizabeth</b></font>) endeavoured in
her (<font color='blue'><b>Elizabeth</b></font>) answer to put an end to every entreaty and expectation of the kind.
Such relief, however, as it was in her (<font color='blue'><b>Elizabeth</b></font>) power to afford, by the practice
of what might be called economy in her (<font color='blue'><b>Elizabeth</b></font>) own private expences, she (<font color='blue'><b>Elizabeth</b></font>)
frequently sent them. It had always been evident to her (<font color='blue'><b>Elizabeth</b></font>) that such an
income as theirs, under the direction of two persons so extravagant in
their wants, and heedless of the future, must be very insufficient to
their support; and whenever they changed their quarters, either Jane or
herself were sure of being applied to for some little assistance
towards discharging their bills. Their manner of living, even when the
restoration of peace dismissed them to a home, was unsettled in the
extreme. They were always moving from place to place in quest of a cheap
situation, and always spending more than they ought. His (<font color='blue'><b>them</b></font>) affection for
her (<font color='blue'><b>Jane</b></font>) soon sunk into indifference; hers lasted a little longer; and
in spite of her (<font color='blue'><b>Jane</b></font>) youth and her (<font color='blue'><b>Jane</b></font>) manners, she (<font color='blue'><b>Jane</b></font>) retained all the claims to
reputation which her (<font color='blue'><b>Jane</b></font>) marriage had given her (<font color='blue'><b>Jane</b></font>).

<p/>Though Darcy could never receive _him (<font color='blue'><b>Darcy</b></font>)_ at Pemberley, yet, for
Elizabeth's sake, he (<font color='blue'><b>Darcy</b></font>) assisted him (<font color='blue'><b>Darcy</b></font>) further in his (<font color='blue'><b>Darcy</b></font>) profession. Lydia was
occasionally a visitor there, when her (<font color='blue'><b>Lydia</b></font>) husband was gone to enjoy himself
in London or Bath; and with the Bingleys they both of them frequently
staid so long, that even Bingley's good humour was overcome, and he (<font color='blue'><b>Bingley</b></font>)
proceeded so far as to talk of giving them a hint to be gone.

<p/>Miss Bingley was very deeply mortified by Darcy's marriage; but as she (<font color='blue'><b>Bingley</b></font>)
thought it advisable to retain the right of visiting at Pemberley, she (<font color='blue'><b>Bingley</b></font>)
dropt all her (<font color='blue'><b>Bingley</b></font>) resentment; was fonder than ever of Georgiana, almost as
attentive to Darcy as heretofore, and paid off every arrear of civility
to Elizabeth.

<p/>Pemberley was now Georgiana's home; and the attachment of the sisters
was exactly what Darcy had hoped to see. They were able to love each
other even as well as they intended. Georgiana had the highest opinion
in the world of Elizabeth; though at first she (<font color='blue'><b>Elizabeth</b></font>) often listened with
an astonishment bordering on alarm at her (<font color='blue'><b>Elizabeth</b></font>) lively, sportive, manner of
talking to her (<font color='blue'><b>Elizabeth</b></font>) brother. He (<font color='blue'><b>brother</b></font>), who had always inspired in herself a respect
which almost overcame her (<font color='blue'><b>Elizabeth</b></font>) affection, she (<font color='blue'><b>Elizabeth</b></font>) now saw the object of open
pleasantry. Her (<font color='blue'><b>Elizabeth</b></font>) mind received knowledge which had never before fallen
in her (<font color='blue'><b>Elizabeth</b></font>) way. By Elizabeth's instructions, she (<font color='blue'><b>Elizabeth</b></font>) began to comprehend that
a woman may take liberties with her (<font color='blue'><b>Elizabeth</b></font>) husband which a brother will not
always allow in a sister more than ten years younger than himself.

<p/>Lady Catherine was extremely indignant on the marriage of her (<font color='blue'><b>Catherine</b></font>) nephew;
and as she (<font color='blue'><b>Catherine</b></font>) gave way to all the genuine frankness of her (<font color='blue'><b>Catherine</b></font>) character in
her (<font color='blue'><b>Catherine</b></font>) reply to the letter which announced its arrangement, she (<font color='blue'><b>Catherine</b></font>) sent him (<font color='blue'><b>character</b></font>)
language so very abusive, especially of Elizabeth, that for some time
all intercourse was at an end. But at length, by Elizabeth's persuasion,
he (<font color='blue'><b>character</b></font>) was prevailed on to overlook the offence, and seek a reconciliation;
and, after a little further resistance on the part of his (<font color='blue'><b>character</b></font>) aunt, her (<font color='blue'><b>aunt</b></font>)
resentment gave way, either to her (<font color='blue'><b>aunt</b></font>) affection for him (<font color='blue'><b>character</b></font>), or her (<font color='blue'><b>aunt</b></font>) curiosity
to see how his (<font color='blue'><b>character</b></font>) wife conducted herself; and she (<font color='blue'><b>aunt</b></font>) condescended to wait
on them at Pemberley, in spite of that pollution which its woods had
received, not merely from the presence of such a mistress, but the
visits of her (<font color='blue'><b>mistress</b></font>) uncle and aunt from the city.

<p/>With the Gardiners, they were always on the most intimate terms.
Darcy, as well as Elizabeth, really loved them; and they were both ever
sensible of the warmest gratitude towards the persons who, by bringing
her (<font color='blue'><b>Elizabeth</b></font>) into Derbyshire, had been the means of uniting them.
