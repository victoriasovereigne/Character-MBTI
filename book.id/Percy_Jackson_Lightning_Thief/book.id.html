1 I ACCIDENTALLY VAPORIZE
MY PRE-ALGEBRA TEACHER
Look, I didn't want to be a half-blood.
If you're reading this because you think you might be one, my advice is: close this book right now.
Believe whatever lie your mom or dad told you about your birth, and try to lead a normal life.
Being a half-blood is dangerous. It's scary. Most of the time, it gets you killed in painful, nasty
ways.
If you're a normal kid, reading this because you think it's fiction, great. Read on. I envy you for
being able to believe that none of this ever happened.
But if you recognize yourself in these pages-if you feel something stirring inside-stop reading
immediately. You might be one of us. And once you know that, it's only a matter of time before they
sense it too, and they'll come for you.
Don't say I didn't warn you.
My name is Percy Jackson.
I'm twelve years old. Until a few months ago, I was a boarding student at Yancy Academy, a
private school for troubled kids in upstate New York.
Am I a troubled kid?
Yeah. You could say that.
I could start at any point in my short miserable life to prove it, but things really started going bad
last May, when our sixth-grade class took a field trip to Manhattan- twenty-eight mental-case kids and
two teachers on a yellow school bus, heading to the Metropolitan Museum of Art to look at ancient
Greek and Roman stuff.
I know-it sounds like torture. Most Yancy field trips were.
But Mr. Brunner, our Latin teacher, was leading this trip, so I had hopes.
Mr. Brunner was this middle-aged guy in a motorized wheelchair. He (<font color='blue'><b>Brunner</b></font>) had thinning hair and a
scruffy beard and a frayed tweed jacket, which always smelled like coffee. You wouldn't think he (<font color='blue'><b>Brunner</b></font>)'d
be cool, but he (<font color='blue'><b>Brunner</b></font>) told stories and jokes and let us play games in class. He (<font color='blue'><b>Brunner</b></font>) also had this awesome
collection of Roman armor and weapons, so he (<font color='blue'><b>Roman</b></font>) was the only teacher whose class didn't put me to
sleep.
I hoped the trip would be okay. At least, I hoped that for once I wouldn't get in trouble.
Boy, was I wrong.
See, bad things happen to me on field trips. Like at my fifth-grade school, when we went to the
Saratoga battlefield, I had this accident with a Revolutionary War cannon. I wasn't aiming for the
school bus, but of course I got expelled anyway. And before that, at my fourth-grade school, when we
took a behind-the-scenes tour of the Marine World shark pool, I sort of hit the wrong lever on the
catwalk and our class took an unplanned swim. And the time before that... Well, you get the idea.
This trip, I was determined to be good.
All the way into the city, I put up with Nancy Bobofit, the freckly, redheaded kleptomaniac girl,
hitting my best friend Grover in the back of the head with chunks of peanut butter-and-ketchup
sandwich.

<p/>Grover was an easy target. He (<font color='blue'><b>Grover</b></font>) was scrawny. He (<font color='blue'><b>Grover</b></font>) cried when he (<font color='blue'><b>Grover</b></font>) got frustrated. He (<font color='blue'><b>Grover</b></font>) must've been
held back several grades, because he (<font color='blue'><b>Grover</b></font>) was the only sixth grader with acne and the start of a wispy
beard on his (<font color='blue'><b>Grover</b></font>) chin. On top of all that, he (<font color='blue'><b>Grover</b></font>) was crippled. He (<font color='blue'><b>Grover</b></font>) had a note excusing him (<font color='blue'><b>Grover</b></font>) from PE for the rest
of his (<font color='blue'><b>Grover</b></font>) life because he (<font color='blue'><b>Grover</b></font>) had some kind of muscular disease in his (<font color='blue'><b>Grover</b></font>) legs. He (<font color='blue'><b>Grover</b></font>) walked funny, like every step
hurt him (<font color='blue'><b>Grover</b></font>), but don't let that fool you. You should've seen him (<font color='blue'><b>fool</b></font>) run when it was enchilada day in the
cafeteria.
Anyway, Nancy Bobofit was throwing wads of sandwich that stuck in his (<font color='blue'><b>fool</b></font>) curly brown hair, and
she (<font color='blue'><b>Bobofit</b></font>) knew I couldn't do anything back to her (<font color='blue'><b>Bobofit</b></font>) because I was already on probation. The headmaster had
threatened me with death by in-school suspension if anything bad, embarrassing, or even mildly
entertaining happened on this trip.
<div class="bookquote">``I'm going to kill her (<font color='blue'><b>I</b></font>),''  (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div>I mumbled.
Grover tried to calm me down. <div class="bookquote">``It's okay. I like peanut butter.''
 (<font color='red'><b>He</b></font>)</div>He (<font color='blue'><b>Grover</b></font>) dodged another piece of Nancy's lunch.
<div class="bookquote">``That's it.''  (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div>I started to get up, but Grover pulled me back to my seat.
<div class="bookquote">``You're already on probation,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Grover</b></font>) reminded me. <div class="bookquote">``You know who'll get blamed if anything
happens.''
 (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div>Looking back on it, I wish I'd decked Nancy Bobofit right then and there. In-school suspension
would've been nothing compared to the mess I was about to get myself into.
Mr. Brunner led the museum tour.
He (<font color='blue'><b>Brunner</b></font>) rode up front in his (<font color='blue'><b>Brunner</b></font>) wheelchair, guiding us through the big echoey galleries, past marble
statues and glass cases full of really old black-and-orange pottery.
It blew my mind that this stuff had survived for two thousand, three thousand years.
He (<font color='blue'><b>Brunner</b></font>) gathered us around a thirteen-foot-tall stone column with a big sphinx on the top, and started
telling us how it was a grave marker, a stele, for a girl about our age. He (<font color='blue'><b>Brunner</b></font>) told us about the carvings on
the sides. I was trying to listen to what he (<font color='blue'><b>Brunner</b></font>) had to say, because it was kind of interesting, but
everybody around me was talking, and every time I told them to shut up, the other teacher chaperone,
Mrs. Dodds, would give me the evil eye.
Mrs. Dodds was this little math teacher from Georgia who always wore a black leather jacket,
even though she (<font color='blue'><b>Dodds</b></font>) was fifty years old. She (<font color='blue'><b>Dodds</b></font>) looked mean enough to ride a Harley right into your locker.
She (<font color='blue'><b>Dodds</b></font>) had come to Yancy halfway through the year, when our last math teacher had a nervous
breakdown.
From her (<font color='blue'><b>Dodds</b></font>) first day, Mrs. Dodds loved Nancy Bobofit and figured I was devil spawn. She (<font color='blue'><b>Dodds</b></font>) would
point her (<font color='blue'><b>Dodds</b></font>) crooked finger at me and say, <div class="bookquote">``Now, honey,''  (<font color='red'><b>me</b></font>)</div>real sweet, and I knew I was going to get
after-school detention for a month.
One time, after she (<font color='blue'><b>Dodds</b></font>)'d made me erase answers out of old math workbooks until midnight, I told
Grover I didn't think Mrs. Dodds was human. He (<font color='blue'><b>Grover</b></font>) looked at me, real serious, and said, <div class="bookquote">``You're
absolutely right.''
 (<font color='red'><b>me</b></font>)</div>Mr. Brunner kept talking about Greek funeral art.
Finally, Nancy Bobofit snickered something about the naked guy on the stele, and I turned around
and said, <div class="bookquote">``Will you shut up?''
 (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div>It came out louder than I meant it to.
The whole group laughed. Mr. Brunner stopped his (<font color='blue'><b>Brunner</b></font>) story.
<div class="bookquote">``Mr. Jackson,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Brunner</b></font>) said, <div class="bookquote">``did you have a comment?''
 (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>My face was totally red. I said, <div class="bookquote">``No, sir.''
 (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div>Mr. Brunner pointed to one of the pictures on the stele. ``Perhaps you'll tell us what this picture

<p/>represents?''
I looked at the carving, and felt a flush of relief, because I actually recognized it. ``That's Kronos
eating his (<font color='blue'><b>Jackson</b></font>) kids, right?''
``Yes,'' Mr. Brunner said, obviously not satisfied. ``And he (<font color='blue'><b>Jackson</b></font>) did this because ...''
``Well...'' I racked my brain to remember. ``Kronos was the king god, and-``
``God?'' Mr. Brunner asked.
``Titan,'' I corrected myself. ``And ... he (<font color='blue'><b>God</b></font>) didn't trust his (<font color='blue'><b>God</b></font>) kids, who were the gods. So, um, Kronos
ate them, right? But his (<font color='blue'><b>God</b></font>) wife hid baby Zeus, and gave Kronos a rock to eat instead. And later, when
Zeus grew up, he (<font color='blue'><b>Zeus</b></font>) tricked his (<font color='blue'><b>Zeus</b></font>) dad, Kronos, into barfing up his (<font color='blue'><b>Zeus</b></font>) brothers and sisters-``
``Eeew!'' said one of the girls behind me.
``-and so there was this big fight between the gods and the Titans,'' I continued, ``and the gods
won.''
Some snickers from the group.
Behind me, Nancy Bobofit mumbled to a friend, ``Like we're going to use this in real life. Like
it's going to say on our job applications, `Please explain why Kronos ate his (<font color='blue'><b>Zeus</b></font>) kids.'''
<div class="bookquote">``And why, Mr. Jackson,''  (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Brunner/Brunner</b></font>)</div>Brunner said, <div class="bookquote">``to paraphrase Miss Bobofit's excellent question, does
this matter in real life?''
 (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Brunner/Brunner</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``Busted,''  (<font color='red'><b>Grover/Grover Underwood/GROVER</b></font>)</div>Grover muttered.
<div class="bookquote">``Shut up,''  (<font color='red'><b>Nancy Bobofit/Nancy</b></font>)</div>Nancy hissed, her (<font color='blue'><b>Nancy</b></font>) face even brighter red than her (<font color='blue'><b>Nancy</b></font>) hair.
At least Nancy got packed, too. Mr. Brunner was the only one who ever caught her (<font color='blue'><b>Nancy</b></font>) saying
anything wrong. He (<font color='blue'><b>Brunner</b></font>) had radar ears.
I thought about his (<font color='blue'><b>Brunner</b></font>) question, and shrugged. <div class="bookquote">``I don't know, sir.''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``I see.''  (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Brunner/Brunner</b></font>)</div>Mr. Brunner looked disappointed. <div class="bookquote">``Well, half credit, Mr. Jackson. Zeus did indeed feed
Kronos a mixture of mustard and wine, which made him (<font color='blue'><b>Zeus</b></font>) disgorge his (<font color='blue'><b>Zeus</b></font>) other five children, who, of
course, being immortal gods, had been living and growing up completely undigested in the Titan's
stomach. The gods defeated their father, sliced him (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) to pieces with his (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) own scythe, and scattered his (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>)
remains in Tartarus, the darkest part of the Underworld. On that happy note, it's time for lunch. Mrs.
Dodds, would you lead us back outside?''
 (<font color='red'><b>the girls</b></font>)</div>The class drifted off, the girls holding their stomachs, the guys pushing each other around and
acting like doofuses.
Grover and I were about to follow when Mr. Brunner said, <div class="bookquote">``Mr. Jackson.''
 (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Brunner/Brunner</b></font>)</div>I knew that was coming.
I told Grover to keep going. Then I turned toward Mr. Brunner. <div class="bookquote">``Sir?''
 (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Brunner/Brunner</b></font>)</div>Mr. Brunner had this look that wouldn't let you go- intense brown eyes that could've been a
thousand years old and had seen everything.
<div class="bookquote">``You must learn the answer to my question,''  (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Brunner/Brunner</b></font>)</div>Mr. Brunner told me.
<div class="bookquote">``About the Titans?''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``About real life. And how your studies apply to it.''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``Oh.''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``What you learn from me,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Brunner</b></font>) said, <div class="bookquote">``is vitally important. I expect you to treat it as such. I will
accept only the best from you, Percy Jackson.''
 (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>I wanted to get angry, this guy pushed me so hard.
I mean, sure, it was kind of cool on tournament days, when he (<font color='blue'><b>Brunner</b></font>) dressed up in a suit of Roman
armor and shouted: ``What ho!''' and challenged us, sword-point against chalk, to run to the board and
name every Greek and Roman person who had ever lived, and their mother, and what god they

<p/>worshipped. But Mr. Brunner expected me to be as good as everybody else, despite the fact that I
have dyslexia and attention deficit disorder and I had never made above a C- in my life. No-he didn't
expect me to be as good; he (<font color='blue'><b>Brunner</b></font>) expected me to be better. And I just couldn't learn all those names and
facts, much less spell them correctly.
I mumbled something about trying harder, while Mr. Brunner took one long sad look at the stele,
like he (<font color='blue'><b>Brunner</b></font>)'d been at this girl's funeral.
He (<font color='blue'><b>Brunner</b></font>) told me to go outside and eat my lunch.
The class gathered on the front steps of the museum, where we could watch the foot traffic along
Fifth Avenue.
Overhead, a huge storm was brewing, with clouds blacker than I'd ever seen over the city. I
figured maybe it was global warming or something, because the weather all across New York state
had been weird since Christmas. We'd had massive snow storms, flooding, wildfires from lightning
strikes. I wouldn't have been surprised if this was a hurricane blowing in.
Nobody else seemed to notice. Some of the guys were pelting pigeons with Lunchables crackers.
Nancy Bobofit was trying to pickpocket something from a lady's purse, and, of course, Mrs. Dodds
wasn't seeing a thing.
Grover and I sat on the edge of the fountain, away from the others. We thought that maybe if we
did that, everybody wouldn't know we were from that school-the school for loser freaks who
couldn't make it elsewhere.
<div class="bookquote">``Detention?''  (<font color='red'><b>Grover/Grover Underwood/GROVER</b></font>)</div>Grover asked.
<div class="bookquote">``Nah,''  (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div>I said. <div class="bookquote">``Not from Brunner. I just wish he (<font color='blue'><b>Brunner</b></font>)'d lay off me sometimes. I mean-I'm not a
genius.''
 (<font color='red'><b>Grover/Grover Underwood/GROVER</b></font>)</div>Grover didn't say anything for a while. Then, when I thought he (<font color='blue'><b>Grover</b></font>) was going to give me some deep
philosophical comment to make me feel better, he (<font color='blue'><b>Grover</b></font>) said, <div class="bookquote">``Can I have your apple?''
 (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>I didn't have much of an appetite, so I let him (<font color='blue'><b>Grover</b></font>) take it.
I watched the stream of cabs going down Fifth Avenue, and thought about my mom's apartment,
only a little ways uptown from where we sat. I hadn't seen her (<font color='blue'><b>mom</b></font>) since Christmas. I wanted so bad to
jump in a taxi and head home. She (<font color='blue'><b>mom</b></font>)'d hug me and be glad to see me, but she (<font color='blue'><b>mom</b></font>)'d be disappointed, too.
She (<font color='blue'><b>mom</b></font>)'d send me right back to Yancy, remind me that I had to try harder, even if this was my sixth
school in six years and I was probably going to be kicked out again. I wouldn't be able to stand that
sad look she (<font color='blue'><b>mom</b></font>)'d give me.
Mr. Brunner parked his (<font color='blue'><b>Brunner</b></font>) wheelchair at the base of the handicapped ramp. He (<font color='blue'><b>Brunner</b></font>) ate celery while he (<font color='blue'><b>Brunner</b></font>)
read a paperback novel. A red umbrella stuck up from the back of his (<font color='blue'><b>Brunner</b></font>) chair, making it look like a
motorized cafe table.
I was about to unwrap my sandwich when Nancy Bobofit appeared in front of me with her (<font color='blue'><b>Bobofit</b></font>) ugly
friends-I guess she (<font color='blue'><b>Bobofit</b></font>)'d gotten tired of stealing from the tourists-and dumped her (<font color='blue'><b>Bobofit</b></font>) half-eaten lunch in
Grover's lap.
<div class="bookquote">``Oops.''  (<font color='red'><b>She</b></font>)</div>She (<font color='blue'><b>Bobofit</b></font>) grinned at me with her (<font color='blue'><b>Bobofit</b></font>) crooked teeth. Her (<font color='blue'><b>Bobofit</b></font>) freckles were orange, as if somebody had
spray-painted her (<font color='blue'><b>Bobofit</b></font>) face with liquid Cheetos.
I tried to stay cool. The school counselor had told me a million times, <div class="bookquote">``Count to ten, get control of
your temper.''  (<font color='red'><b>me</b></font>)</div>But I was so mad my mind went blank. A wave roared in my ears.
I don't remember touching her (<font color='blue'><b>Bobofit</b></font>), but the next thing I knew, Nancy was sitting on her (<font color='blue'><b>Nancy</b></font>) butt in the
fountain, screaming, <div class="bookquote">``Percy pushed me!''
 (<font color='red'><b>Nancy Bobofit/Nancy</b></font>)</div>Mrs. Dodds materialized next to us.
Some of the kids were whispering: ``Did you see-``

<p/>``-the water-``
``-like it grabbed her (<font color='blue'><b>I</b></font>)-``
I didn't know what they were talking about. All I knew was that I was in trouble again.
As soon as Mrs. Dodds was sure poor little Nancy was okay, promising to get her (<font color='blue'><b>Nancy</b></font>) a new shirt at
the museum gift shop, etc., etc., Mrs. Dodds turned on me. There was a triumphant fire in her (<font color='blue'><b>Dodds</b></font>) eyes, as
if I'd done something she (<font color='blue'><b>Dodds</b></font>)'d been waiting for all semester. ``Now, honey-``
<div class="bookquote">``I know,''  (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div>I grumbled. <div class="bookquote">``A month erasing workbooks.''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>That wasn't the right thing to say.
<div class="bookquote">``Come with me,''  (<font color='red'><b>Mrs. Dodds/Dodds</b></font>)</div>Mrs. Dodds said.
<div class="bookquote">``Wait!''  (<font color='red'><b>Grover/Grover Underwood/GROVER</b></font>)</div>Grover yelped. <div class="bookquote">``It was me. I pushed her (<font color='blue'><b>Dodds</b></font>).''
 (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div>I stared at him (<font color='blue'><b>Grover</b></font>), stunned. I couldn't believe he (<font color='blue'><b>Grover</b></font>) was trying to cover for me. Mrs. Dodds scared
Grover to death.
She (<font color='blue'><b>Dodds</b></font>) glared at him (<font color='blue'><b>Grover</b></font>) so hard his (<font color='blue'><b>Grover</b></font>) whiskery chin trembled.
<div class="bookquote">``I don't think so, Mr. Underwood,''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Dodds</b></font>) said.
``But-``
<div class="bookquote">``You-will-stay-here.''
 (<font color='red'><b>Grover/Grover Underwood/GROVER</b></font>)</div>Grover looked at me desperately.
<div class="bookquote">``It's okay, man,''  (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div>I told him (<font color='blue'><b>Grover</b></font>). <div class="bookquote">``Thanks for trying.''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``Honey,''  (<font color='red'><b>Mrs. Dodds/Dodds</b></font>)</div>Mrs. Dodds barked at me. <div class="bookquote">``Now.''
 (<font color='red'><b>Nancy Bobofit/Nancy</b></font>)</div>Nancy Bobofit smirked.
I gave her (<font color='blue'><b>Bobofit</b></font>) my deluxe I'll-kill-you-later stare. Then I turned to face Mrs. Dodds, but she (<font color='blue'><b>Dodds</b></font>) wasn't
there. She (<font color='blue'><b>Dodds</b></font>) was standing at the museum entrance, way at the top of the steps, gesturing impatiently at
me to come on.
How'd she (<font color='blue'><b>Dodds</b></font>) get there so fast?
I have moments like that a lot, when my brain falls asleep or something, and the next thing I know
I've missed something, as if a puzzle piece fell out of the universe and left me staring at the blank
place behind it. The school counselor told me this was part of the ADHD, my brain misinterpreting
things.
I wasn't so sure.
I went after Mrs. Dodds.
Halfway up the steps, I glanced back at Grover. He (<font color='blue'><b>Grover</b></font>) was looking pale, cutting his (<font color='blue'><b>Grover</b></font>) eyes between me
and Mr. Brunner, like he (<font color='blue'><b>Brunner</b></font>) wanted Mr. Brunner to notice what was going on, but Mr. Brunner was
absorbed in his (<font color='blue'><b>Brunner</b></font>) novel.
I looked back up. Mrs. Dodds had disappeared again. She (<font color='blue'><b>Dodds</b></font>) was now inside the building, at the end
of the entrance hall.
Okay, I thought. She (<font color='blue'><b>Dodds</b></font>)'s going to make me buy a new shirt for Nancy at the gift shop.
But apparently that wasn't the plan.
I followed her (<font color='blue'><b>Nancy</b></font>) deeper into the museum. When I finally caught up to her (<font color='blue'><b>Nancy</b></font>), we were back in the
Greek and Roman section.
Except for us, the gallery was empty.
Mrs. Dodds stood with her (<font color='blue'><b>Dodds</b></font>) arms crossed in front of a big marble frieze of the Greek gods. She (<font color='blue'><b>Dodds</b></font>)
was making this weird noise in her (<font color='blue'><b>Dodds</b></font>) throat, like growling.
Even without the noise, I would've been nervous. It's weird being alone with a teacher,
especially Mrs. Dodds. Something about the way she (<font color='blue'><b>Dodds</b></font>) looked at the frieze, as if she (<font color='blue'><b>Dodds</b></font>) wanted to
pulverize it...

<p/><div class="bookquote">``You've been giving us problems, honey,''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Dodds</b></font>) said.
I did the safe thing. I said, <div class="bookquote">``Yes, ma’am.''
 (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div>She (<font color='blue'><b>Dodds</b></font>) tugged on the cuffs of her (<font color='blue'><b>Dodds</b></font>) leather jacket. <div class="bookquote">``Did you really think you would get away with it?''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>The look in her (<font color='blue'><b>Dodds</b></font>) eyes was beyond mad. It was evil.
She (<font color='blue'><b>Dodds</b></font>)'s a teacher, I thought nervously. It's not like she (<font color='blue'><b>Dodds</b></font>)'s going to hurt me.
I said, <div class="bookquote">``I'll-I'll try harder, ma’am.''
 (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div>Thunder shook the building.
<div class="bookquote">``We are not fools, Percy Jackson,''  (<font color='red'><b>Mrs. Dodds/Dodds</b></font>)</div>Mrs. Dodds said. <div class="bookquote">``It was only a matter of time before we
found you out. Confess, and you will suffer less pain.''
 (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div>I didn't know what she (<font color='blue'><b>Dodds</b></font>) was talking about.
All I could think of was that the teachers must've found the illegal stash of candy I'd been selling
out of my dorm room. Or maybe they'd realized I got my essay on Tom Sawyer from the Internet
without ever reading the book and now they were going to take away my grade. Or worse, they were
going to make me read the book.
<div class="bookquote">``Well?''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Dodds</b></font>) demanded.
<div class="bookquote">``Ma’am, I don't...''
 (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``Your time is up,''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Dodds</b></font>) hissed.
Then the weirdest thing happened. Her (<font color='blue'><b>Dodds</b></font>) eyes began to glow like barbecue coals. Her (<font color='blue'><b>Dodds</b></font>) fingers
stretched, turning into talons. Her (<font color='blue'><b>Dodds</b></font>) jacket melted into large, leathery wings. She (<font color='blue'><b>Dodds</b></font>) wasn't human. She (<font color='blue'><b>Dodds</b></font>)
was a shriveled hag with bat wings and claws and a mouth full of yellow fangs, and she (<font color='blue'><b>Dodds</b></font>) was about to
slice me to ribbons.
Then things got even stranger.
Mr. Brunner, who'd been out in front of the museum a minute before, wheeled his (<font color='blue'><b>Brunner</b></font>) chair into the
doorway of the gallery, holding a pen in his (<font color='blue'><b>Brunner</b></font>) hand.
<div class="bookquote">``What ho, Percy!''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Brunner</b></font>) shouted, and tossed the pen through the air.
Mrs. Dodds lunged at me.
With a yelp, I dodged and felt talons slash the air next to my ear. I snatched the ballpoint pen out
of the air, but when it hit my hand, it wasn't a pen anymore. It was a sword-Mr. Brunner's bronze
sword, which he (<font color='blue'><b>Brunner</b></font>) always used on tournament day.
Mrs. Dodds spun toward me with a murderous look in her (<font color='blue'><b>Dodds</b></font>) eyes.
My knees were jelly. My hands were shaking so bad I almost dropped the sword.
She (<font color='blue'><b>Dodds</b></font>) snarled, <div class="bookquote">``Die, honey!''
 (<font color='red'><b>She</b></font>)</div>And she (<font color='blue'><b>Dodds</b></font>) flew straight at me.
Absolute terror ran through my body. I did the only thing that came naturally: I swung the sword.
The metal blade hit her (<font color='blue'><b>Dodds</b></font>) shoulder and passed clean through her (<font color='blue'><b>Dodds</b></font>) body as if she (<font color='blue'><b>Dodds</b></font>) were made of water.
Hisss!
Mrs. Dodds was a sand castle in a power fan. She (<font color='blue'><b>Dodds</b></font>) exploded into yellow powder, vaporized on
the spot, leaving nothing but the smell of sulfur and a dying screech and a chill of evil in the air, as if
those two glowing red eyes were still watching me.
I was alone.
There was a ballpoint pen in my hand.
Mr. Brunner wasn't there. Nobody was there but me.
My hands were still trembling. My lunch must've been contaminated with magic mushrooms or
something.
Had I imagined the whole thing?

<p/>I went back outside.
It had started to rain.
Grover was sitting by the fountain, a museum map tented over his (<font color='blue'><b>Grover</b></font>) head. Nancy Bobofit was still
standing there, soaked from her (<font color='blue'><b>Bobofit</b></font>) swim in the fountain, grumbling to her (<font color='blue'><b>Bobofit</b></font>) ugly friends. When she (<font color='blue'><b>Bobofit</b></font>) saw me,
she (<font color='blue'><b>Bobofit</b></font>) said, <div class="bookquote">``I hope Mrs. Kerr whipped your butt.''
 (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>I said, <div class="bookquote">``Who?''
 (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``Our teacher. Duh!''
 (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div>I blinked. We had no teacher named Mrs. Kerr. I asked Nancy what she (<font color='blue'><b>Nancy</b></font>) was talking about.
She (<font color='blue'><b>Nancy</b></font>) just rolled her (<font color='blue'><b>Nancy</b></font>) eyes and turned away.
I asked Grover where Mrs. Dodds was.
He (<font color='blue'><b>Grover</b></font>) said, <div class="bookquote">``Who?''
 (<font color='red'><b>He</b></font>)</div>But he (<font color='blue'><b>Grover</b></font>) paused first, and he (<font color='blue'><b>Grover</b></font>) wouldn't look at me, so I thought he (<font color='blue'><b>Grover</b></font>) was messing with me.
<div class="bookquote">``Not funny, man,''  (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div>I told him (<font color='blue'><b>Grover</b></font>). <div class="bookquote">``This is serious.''
 (<font color='red'><b>Thunder</b></font>)</div>Thunder boomed overhead.
I saw Mr. Brunner sitting under his (<font color='blue'><b>Brunner</b></font>) red umbrella, reading his (<font color='blue'><b>Brunner</b></font>) book, as if he (<font color='blue'><b>Brunner</b></font>)'d never moved.
I went over to him (<font color='blue'><b>Brunner</b></font>).
He (<font color='blue'><b>Brunner</b></font>) looked up, a little distracted. <div class="bookquote">``Ah, that would be my pen. Please bring your own writing
utensil in the future, Mr. Jackson.''
 (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div>I handed Mr. Brunner his (<font color='blue'><b>Brunner</b></font>) pen. I hadn't even realized I was still holding it.
<div class="bookquote">``Sir,''  (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div>I said, <div class="bookquote">``where's Mrs. Dodds?''
 (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div>He (<font color='blue'><b>Brunner</b></font>) stared at me blankly. <div class="bookquote">``Who?''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``The other chaperone. Mrs. Dodds. The pre-algebra teacher.''
 (<font color='red'><b>He</b></font>)</div>He (<font color='blue'><b>Brunner</b></font>) frowned and sat forward, looking mildly concerned. <div class="bookquote">``Percy, there is no Mrs. Dodds on this
trip. As far as I know, there has never been a Mrs. Dodds at Yancy Academy. Are you feeling all
right?''

 (<font color='red'><b>Percy/Percy Jackson/Jackson</b></font>)</div><p/>Percy Jackson 1 - The Lightning Thief
2 THREE OLD LADIES KNIT
THE SOCKS OF DEATH
I was used to the occasional weird experience, but usually they were over quickly. This twentyfour/seven hallucination was more than I could handle. For the rest of the school year, the entire
campus seemed to be playing some kind of trick on me. The students acted as if they were completely
and totally convinced that Mrs. Kerr-a perky blond woman whom I'd never seen in my life until she (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>)
got on our bus at the end of the field trip-had been our pre-algebra teacher since Christmas.
Every so often I would spring a Mrs. Dodds reference on somebody, just to see if I could trip
them up, but they would stare at me like I was psycho.
It got so I almost believed them-Mrs. Dodds had never existed.
Almost.
But Grover couldn't fool me. When I mentioned the name Dodds to him (<font color='blue'><b>Grover</b></font>), he (<font color='blue'><b>Grover</b></font>) would hesitate, then
claim she (<font color='blue'><b>Dodds</b></font>) didn't exist. But I knew he (<font color='blue'><b>Grover</b></font>) was lying.
Something was going on. Something had happened at the museum.
I didn't have much time to think about it during the days, but at night, visions of Mrs. Dodds with
talons and leathery wings would wake me up in a cold sweat.
The freak weather continued, which didn't help my mood. One night, a thunderstorm blew out the
windows in my dorm room. A few days later, the biggest tornado ever spotted in the Hudson Valley
touched down only fifty miles from Yancy Academy. One of the current events we studied in social
studies class was the unusual number of small planes that had gone down in sudden squalls in the
Atlantic that year.
I started feeling cranky and irritable most of the time. My grades slipped from Ds to Fs. I got into
more fights with Nancy Bobofit and her (<font color='blue'><b>Bobofit</b></font>) friends. I was sent out into the hallway in almost every class.
Finally, when our English teacher, Mr. Nicoll, asked me for the millionth time why I was too lazy
to study for spelling tests, I snapped. I called him (<font color='blue'><b>Mr.</b></font>) an old sot. I wasn't even sure what it meant, but it
sounded good.
The headmaster sent my mom a letter the following week, making it official: I would not be
invited back next year to Yancy Academy.
Fine, I told myself. Just fine.
I was homesick.
I wanted to be with my mom in our little apartment on the Upper East Side, even if I had to go to
public school and put up with my obnoxious stepfather and his (<font color='blue'><b>stepfather</b></font>) stupid poker parties.
And yet... there were things I'd miss at Yancy. The view of the woods out my dorm window, the
Hudson River in the distance, the smell of pine trees. I'd miss Grover, who'd been a good friend,
even if he (<font color='blue'><b>Grover</b></font>) was a little strange. I worried how he (<font color='blue'><b>Grover</b></font>)'d survive next year without me.
I'd miss Latin class, too-Mr. Brunner's crazy tournament days and his (<font color='blue'><b>Brunner</b></font>) faith that I could do well.
As exam week got closer, Latin was the only test I studied for. I hadn't forgotten what Mr.
Brunner had told me about this subject being life-and-death for me. I wasn't sure why, but I'd started
to believe him (<font color='blue'><b>Brunner</b></font>).
The evening before my final, I got so frustrated I threw the Cambridge Guide to Greek Mythology

<p/>across my dorm room. Words had started swimming off the page, circling my head, the letters doing
one-eighties as if they were riding skateboards. There was no way I was going to remember the
difference between Chiron and Charon, or Polydictes and Polydeuces. And conjugating those Latin
verbs? Forget it.
I paced the room, feeling like ants were crawling around inside my shirt.
I remembered Mr. Brunner's serious expression, his (<font color='blue'><b>Brunner</b></font>) thousand-year-old eyes. I will accept only
the best from you, Percy Jackson.
I took a deep breath. I picked up the mythology book.
I'd never asked a teacher for help before. Maybe if I talked to Mr. Brunner, he (<font color='blue'><b>Brunner</b></font>) could give me
some pointers. At least I could apologize for the big fat F I was about to score on his (<font color='blue'><b>Brunner</b></font>) exam. I didn't
want to leave Yancy Academy with him (<font color='blue'><b>Academy</b></font>) thinking I hadn't tried.
I walked downstairs to the faculty offices. Most of them were dark and empty, but Mr. Brunner's
door was ajar, light from his (<font color='blue'><b>Brunner</b></font>) window stretching across the hallway floor.
I was three steps from the door handle when I heard voices inside the office. Mr. Brunner asked a
question. A voice that was definitely Grover's said <div class="bookquote">``... worried about Percy, sir.''
 (<font color='red'><b>Grover/Grover Underwood/GROVER</b></font>)</div>I froze.
I'm not usually an eavesdropper, but I dare you to try not listening if you hear your best friend
talking about you to an adult.
I inched closer.
<div class="bookquote">``... alone this summer,''  (<font color='red'><b>Grover/Grover Underwood/GROVER</b></font>)</div>Grover was saying. ``I mean, a Kindly One in the school! Now that we
know for sure, and they know too-``
<div class="bookquote">``We would only make matters worse by rushing him (<font color='blue'><b>Percy</b></font>),''  (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Brunner/Brunner</b></font>)</div>Mr. Brunner said. <div class="bookquote">``We need the boy to
mature more.''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>``But he (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>) may not have time. The summer solstice deadline- ``
<div class="bookquote">``Will have to be resolved without him (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>), Grover. Let him (<font color='blue'><b>Grover</b></font>) enjoy his (<font color='blue'><b>Grover</b></font>) ignorance while he (<font color='blue'><b>Grover</b></font>) still can.''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``Sir, he (<font color='blue'><b>Grover</b></font>) saw her (<font color='blue'><b>Percy</b></font>)... .''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``His (<font color='blue'><b>Grover</b></font>) imagination,''  (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Brunner/Brunner</b></font>)</div>Mr. Brunner insisted. <div class="bookquote">``The Mist over the students and staff will be enough to
convince him (<font color='blue'><b>Grover</b></font>) of that.''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``Sir, I ... I can't fail in my duties again.''  (<font color='red'><b>Grover/Grover Underwood/GROVER</b></font>)</div>Grover's voice was choked with emotion. <div class="bookquote">``You know
what that would mean.''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``You haven't failed, Grover,''  (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Brunner/Brunner</b></font>)</div>Mr. Brunner said kindly. ``I should have seen her (<font color='blue'><b>Percy</b></font>) for what she (<font color='blue'><b>Percy</b></font>) was.
Now let's just worry about keeping Percy alive until next fall-``
The mythology book dropped out of my hand and hit the floor with a thud.
Mr. Brunner went silent.
My heart hammering, I picked up the book and backed down the hall.
A shadow slid across the lighted glass of Brunner's office door, the shadow of something much
taller than my wheelchair-bound teacher, holding something that looked suspiciously like an archer's
bow.
I opened the nearest door and slipped inside.
A few seconds later I heard a slow clop-clop-clop, like muffled wood blocks, then a sound like
an animal snuffling right outside my door. A large, dark shape paused in front of the glass, then moved
on.
A bead of sweat trickled down my neck.
Somewhere in the hallway, Mr. Brunner spoke. <div class="bookquote">``Nothing,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Brunner</b></font>) murmured. <div class="bookquote">``My nerves haven't
been right since the winter solstice.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Mine neither,''  (<font color='red'><b>Grover/Grover Underwood/GROVER</b></font>)</div>Grover said. <div class="bookquote">``But I could have sworn ...''
 (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Brunner/Brunner</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``Go back to the dorm,''  (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Brunner/Brunner</b></font>)</div>Mr. Brunner told him (<font color='blue'><b>Brunner</b></font>). <div class="bookquote">``You've got a long day of exams tomorrow.''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``Don't remind me.''
 (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Brunner/Brunner</b></font>)</div>The lights went out in Mr. Brunner's office.
I waited in the dark for what seemed like forever.
Finally, I slipped out into the hallway and made my way back up to the dorm.
Grover was lying on his (<font color='blue'><b>Grover</b></font>) bed, studying his (<font color='blue'><b>Grover</b></font>) Latin exam notes like he (<font color='blue'><b>Grover</b></font>)'d been there all night.
<div class="bookquote">``Hey,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Grover</b></font>) said, bleary-eyed. <div class="bookquote">``You going to be ready for this test?''
 (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div>I didn't answer.
<div class="bookquote">``You look awful.''  (<font color='red'><b>He</b></font>)</div>He (<font color='blue'><b>Grover</b></font>) frowned. <div class="bookquote">``Is everything okay?''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``Just... tired.''
 (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div>I turned so he (<font color='blue'><b>Grover</b></font>) couldn't read my expression, and started getting ready for bed.
I didn't understand what I'd heard downstairs. I wanted to believe I'd imagined the whole thing.
But one thing was clear: Grover and Mr. Brunner were talking about me behind my back. They
thought I was in some kind of danger.
The next afternoon, as I was leaving the three-hour Latin exam, my eyes swimming with all the
Greek and Roman names I'd misspelled, Mr. Brunner called me back inside.
For a moment, I was worried he (<font color='blue'><b>Brunner</b></font>)'d found out about my eavesdropping the night before, but that
didn't seem to be the problem.
<div class="bookquote">``Percy,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Brunner</b></font>) said. <div class="bookquote">``Don't be discouraged about leaving Yancy. It's ... it's for the best.''
 (<font color='red'><b>me</b></font>)</div>His (<font color='blue'><b>Brunner</b></font>) tone was kind, but the words still embarrassed me. Even though he (<font color='blue'><b>Brunner</b></font>) was speaking quietly, the
other kids finishing the test could hear. Nancy Bobofit smirked at me and made sarcastic little kissing
motions with her (<font color='blue'><b>Bobofit</b></font>) lips.
I mumbled, <div class="bookquote">``Okay, sir.''
 (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``I mean ...''  (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Brunner/Brunner</b></font>)</div>Mr. Brunner wheeled his (<font color='blue'><b>Brunner</b></font>) chair back and forth, like he (<font color='blue'><b>Brunner</b></font>) wasn't sure what to say. <div class="bookquote">``This
isn't the right place for you. It was only a matter of time.''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>My eyes stung.
Here was my favorite teacher, in front of the class, telling me I couldn't handle it. After saying he (<font color='blue'><b>Brunner</b></font>)
believed in me all year, now he (<font color='blue'><b>Brunner</b></font>) was telling me I was destined to get kicked out.
<div class="bookquote">``Right,''  (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div>I said, trembling.
<div class="bookquote">``No, no,''  (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Brunner/Brunner</b></font>)</div>Mr. Brunner said. ``Oh, confound it all. What I'm trying to say ... you're not normal,
Percy. That's nothing to be-``
<div class="bookquote">``Thanks,''  (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div>I blurted. ``Thanks a lot, sir, for reminding me.
``Percy-``
But I was already gone.
On the last day of the term, I shoved my clothes into my suitcase.
The other guys were joking around, talking about their vacation plans. One of them was going on a
hiking trip to Switzerland. Another was cruising the Caribbean for a month. They were juvenile
delinquents, like me, but they were rich juvenile delinquents. Their daddies were executives, or
ambassadors, or celebrities. I was a nobody, from a family of nobodies.
They asked me what I'd be doing this summer and I told them I was going back to the city.
What I didn't tell them was that I'd have to get a summer job walking dogs or selling magazine
subscriptions, and spend my free time worrying about where I'd go to school in the fall.
``Oh,'' one of the guys said. <div class="bookquote">``That's cool.''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>They went back to their conversation as if I'd never existed.

<p/>The only person I dreaded saying good-bye to was Grover, but as it turned out, I didn't have to.
He (<font color='blue'><b>Grover</b></font>)'d booked a ticket to Manhattan on the same Greyhound as I had, so there we were, together again,
heading into the city.
During the whole bus ride, Grover kept glancing nervously down the aisle, watching the other
passengers. It occurred to me that he (<font color='blue'><b>Grover</b></font>)'d always acted nervous and fidgety when we left Yancy, as if he (<font color='blue'><b>Yancy</b></font>)
expected something bad to happen. Before, I'd always assumed he (<font color='blue'><b>Yancy</b></font>) was worried about getting teased.
But there was nobody to tease him (<font color='blue'><b>Yancy</b></font>) on the Greyhound.
Finally I couldn't stand it anymore.
I said, <div class="bookquote">``Looking for Kindly Ones?''
 (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div>Grover nearly jumped out of his (<font color='blue'><b>Grover</b></font>) seat. <div class="bookquote">``Wha-what do you mean?''
 (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div>I confessed about eavesdropping on him (<font color='blue'><b>Grover</b></font>) and Mr. Brunner the night before the exam.
Grover's eye twitched. <div class="bookquote">``How much did you hear?''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``Oh ... not much. What's the summer solstice dead-line?''
 (<font color='red'><b>He</b></font>)</div>He (<font color='blue'><b>Grover</b></font>) winced. <div class="bookquote">``Look, Percy ... I was just worried for you, see? I mean, hallucinating about demon
math teachers ...''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>``Grover-``
<div class="bookquote">``And I was telling Mr. Brunner that maybe you were overstressed or something, because there
was no such person as Mrs. Dodds, and ...''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``Grover, you're a really, really bad liar.''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>His (<font color='blue'><b>Grover</b></font>) ears turned pink.
From his (<font color='blue'><b>Grover</b></font>) shirt pocket, he (<font color='blue'><b>Grover</b></font>) fished out a grubby business card. ``Just take this, okay? In case you need
me this summer.
The card was in fancy script, which was murder on my dyslexic eyes, but I finally made out
something like:
Grover Underwood
Keeper
Half-Blood Hill
Long Island, New York
-LRB-800-RRB- 009-0009
``What's Half-``
``Don't say it aloud!'' he (<font color='blue'><b>Grover</b></font>) yelped. ``That's my, um ... summer address.''
My heart sank. Grover had a summer home. I'd never considered that his (<font color='blue'><b>Grover</b></font>) family might be as rich
as the others at Yancy.
``Okay,'' I said glumly. ``So, like, if I want to come visit your mansion.''
He (<font color='blue'><b>Yancy</b></font>) nodded. ``Or ... or if you need me.''
``Why would I need you?''
It came out harsher than I meant it to.
Grover blushed right down to his (<font color='blue'><b>Grover</b></font>) Adam's apple. ``Look, Percy, the truth is, I-I kind of have to
protect you.''
I stared at him (<font color='blue'><b>Grover</b></font>).
All year long, I'd gotten in fights, keeping bullies away from him (<font color='blue'><b>Grover</b></font>). I'd lost sleep worrying that
he (<font color='blue'><b>Grover</b></font>)'d get beaten up next year without me. And here he (<font color='blue'><b>Grover</b></font>) was acting like he (<font color='blue'><b>Grover</b></font>) was the one who defended
me.
``Grover,'' I said, <div class="bookquote">``what exactly are you protecting me from?''
 (<font color='red'><b>Grover</b></font>)</div>There was a huge grinding noise under our feet. Black smoke poured from the dashboard and the

<p/>whole bus filled with a smell like rotten eggs. The driver cursed and limped the Greyhound over to
the side of the highway.
After a few minutes clanking around in the engine compartment, the driver announced that we'd
all have to get off. Grover and I filed outside with everybody else.
We were on a stretch of country road-no place you'd notice if you didn't break down there. On
our side of the highway was nothing but maple trees and litter from passing cars. On the other side,
across four lanes of asphalt shimmering with afternoon heat, was an old-fashioned fruit stand.
The stuff on sale looked really good: heaping boxes of bloodred cherries and apples, walnuts and
apricots, jugs of cider in a claw-foot tub full of ice. There were no customers, just three old ladies
sitting in rocking chairs in the shade of a maple tree, knitting the biggest pair of socks I'd ever seen.
I mean these socks were the size of sweaters, but they were clearly socks. The lady on the right
knitted one of them. The lady on the left knitted the other. The lady in the middle held an enormous
basket of electric-blue yarn.
All three women looked ancient, with pale faces wrinkled like fruit leather, silver hair tied back
in white bandannas, bony arms sticking out of bleached cotton dresses.
The weirdest thing was, they seemed to be looking right at me.
I looked over at Grover to say something about this and saw that the blood had drained from his (<font color='blue'><b>Grover</b></font>)
face. His (<font color='blue'><b>Grover</b></font>) nose was twitching.
<div class="bookquote">``Grover?''  (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div>I said. ``Hey, man-``
<div class="bookquote">``Tell me they're not looking at you. They are, aren't they?''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``Yeah. Weird, huh? You think those socks would fit me?''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``Not funny, Percy. Not funny at all.''
 (<font color='red'><b>The lady</b></font>)</div>The old lady in the middle took out a huge pair of scissors-gold and silver, long-bladed, like
shears. I heard Grover catch his (<font color='blue'><b>Grover</b></font>) breath.
<div class="bookquote">``We're getting on the bus,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Grover</b></font>) told me. <div class="bookquote">``Come on.''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``What?''  (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div>I said. <div class="bookquote">``It's a thousand degrees in there.''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>``Come on!''' He (<font color='blue'><b>Percy</b></font>) pried open the door and climbed inside, but I stayed back.
Across the road, the old ladies were still watching me. The middle one cut the yarn, and I swear I
could hear that snip across four lanes of traffic. Her (<font color='blue'><b>You</b></font>) two friends balled up the electric-blue socks,
leaving me wondering who they could possibly be for-Sasquatch or Godzilla.
At the rear of the bus, the driver wrenched a big chunk of smoking metal out of the engine
compartment. The bus shuddered, and the engine roared back to life.
The passengers cheered.
``Darn right!'' yelled the driver. He (<font color='blue'><b>Grover</b></font>) slapped the bus with his (<font color='blue'><b>Grover</b></font>) hat. ``Everybody back on board!''
Once we got going, I started feeling feverish, as if I'd caught the flu.
Grover didn't look much better. He (<font color='blue'><b>Grover</b></font>) was shivering and his (<font color='blue'><b>Grover</b></font>) teeth were chattering.
``Grover?''
``Yeah?''
``What are you not telling me?''
He (<font color='blue'><b>Grover</b></font>) dabbed his (<font color='blue'><b>Grover</b></font>) forehead with his (<font color='blue'><b>Grover</b></font>) shirt sleeve. ``Percy, what did you see back at the fruit stand?''
``You mean the old ladies? What is it about them, man? They're not like ... Mrs. Dodds, are
they?''
His (<font color='blue'><b>Grover</b></font>) expression was hard to read, but I got the feeling that the fruit-stand ladies were something
much, much worse than Mrs. Dodds. He (<font color='blue'><b>Grover</b></font>) said, ``Just tell me what you saw.''
<div class="bookquote">``The middle one took out her (<font color='blue'><b>Dodds</b></font>) scissors, and she (<font color='blue'><b>Dodds</b></font>) cut the yarn.''

 (<font color='red'><b>He</b></font>)</div><p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Grover</b></font>) closed his (<font color='blue'><b>Grover</b></font>) eyes and made a gesture with his (<font color='blue'><b>Grover</b></font>) fingers that might've been crossing himself, but it
wasn't. It was something else, something almost-older.
He (<font color='blue'><b>Grover</b></font>) said, <div class="bookquote">``You saw her (<font color='blue'><b>Dodds</b></font>) snip the cord.''
 (<font color='red'><b>He</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``Yeah. So?''  (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div>But even as I said it, I knew it was a big deal.
<div class="bookquote">``This is not happening,''  (<font color='red'><b>Grover/Grover Underwood/GROVER</b></font>)</div>Grover mumbled. He (<font color='blue'><b>Grover</b></font>) started chewing at his (<font color='blue'><b>Grover</b></font>) thumb. <div class="bookquote">``I don't want this to
be like the last time.''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``What last time?''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``Always sixth grade. They never get past sixth.''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``Grover,''  (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div>I said, because he (<font color='blue'><b>Grover</b></font>) was really starting to scare me. <div class="bookquote">``What are you talking about?''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``Let me walk you home from the bus station. Promise me.''
 (<font color='red'><b>me</b></font>)</div>This seemed like a strange request to me, but I promised he (<font color='blue'><b>Grover</b></font>) could.
<div class="bookquote">``Is this like a superstition or something?''  (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div>I asked.
No answer.
<div class="bookquote">``Grover-that snipping of the yarn. Does that mean somebody is going to die?''
 (<font color='red'><b>He</b></font>)</div>He (<font color='blue'><b>Grover</b></font>) looked at me mournfully, like he (<font color='blue'><b>Grover</b></font>) was already picking the kind of flowers I'd like best on my
coffin.

LOSES HIS (<font color='blue'><b>GROVER</b></font>) PANTS
Confession time: I ditched Grover as soon as we got to the bus terminal.
I know, I know. It was rude. But Grover was freaking me out, looking at me like I was a dead
man, muttering <div class="bookquote">``Why does this always happen?''  (<font color='red'><b>a man</b></font>)</div>and <div class="bookquote">``Why does it always have to he (<font color='blue'><b>Grover</b></font>) sixth grade?''
 (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>Whenever he (<font color='blue'><b>Grover</b></font>) got upset, Grover's bladder acted up, so I wasn't surprised when, as soon as we got
off the bus, he (<font color='blue'><b>Grover</b></font>) made me promise to wait for him (<font color='blue'><b>Grover</b></font>), then made a beeline for the restroom. Instead of
waiting, I got my suitcase, slipped outside, and caught the first taxi uptown.
<div class="bookquote">``East One-hundred-and-fourth and First,''  (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div>I told the driver.
A word about my mother, before you meet her (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>).
Her (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) name is Sally Jackson and she (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>)'s the best person in the world, which just proves my theory
that the best people have the rottenest luck. Her (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) own parents died in a plane crash when she (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) was five,
and she (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) was raised by an uncle who didn't care much about her (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>). She (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) wanted to be a novelist, so she (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>)
spent high school working to save enough money for a college with a good creative-writing program.
Then her (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) uncle got cancer, and she (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) had to quit school her (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) senior year to take care of him (<font color='blue'><b>uncle</b></font>). After he (<font color='blue'><b>uncle</b></font>)
died, she (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) was left with no money, no family, and no diploma.
The only good break she (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) ever got was meeting my dad.
I don't have any memories of him (<font color='blue'><b>dad</b></font>), just this sort of warm glow, maybe the barest trace of his (<font color='blue'><b>dad</b></font>) smile.
My mom doesn't like to talk about him (<font color='blue'><b>dad</b></font>) because it makes her (<font color='blue'><b>mom</b></font>) sad. She (<font color='blue'><b>mom</b></font>) has no pictures.
See, they weren't married. She (<font color='blue'><b>mom</b></font>) told me he (<font color='blue'><b>dad</b></font>) was rich and important, and their relationship was a
secret. Then one day, he (<font color='blue'><b>dad</b></font>) set sail across the Atlantic on some important journey, and he (<font color='blue'><b>dad</b></font>) never came
back.
Lost at sea, my mom told me. Not dead. Lost at sea.
She (<font color='blue'><b>mom</b></font>) worked odd jobs, took night classes to get her (<font color='blue'><b>mom</b></font>) high school diploma, and raised me on her (<font color='blue'><b>mom</b></font>)
own. She (<font color='blue'><b>mom</b></font>) never complained or got mad. Not even once. But I knew I wasn't an easy kid.
Finally, she (<font color='blue'><b>mom</b></font>) married Gabe Ugliano, who was nice the first thirty seconds we knew him (<font color='blue'><b>Ugliano</b></font>), then
showed his (<font color='blue'><b>Ugliano</b></font>) true colors as a world-class jerk. When I was young, I nicknamed him (<font color='blue'><b>Ugliano</b></font>) Smelly Gabe. I'm
sorry, but it's the truth. The guy reeked like moldy garlic pizza wrapped in gym shorts.
Between the two of us, we made my mom's life pretty hard. The way Smelly Gabe treated her (<font color='blue'><b>mom</b></font>), the
way he (<font color='blue'><b>Gabe</b></font>) and I got along ... well, when I came home is a good example.
I walked into our little apartment, hoping my mom would be home from work. Instead, Smelly
Gabe was in the living room, playing poker with his (<font color='blue'><b>Gabe</b></font>) buddies. The television blared ESPN. Chips and
beer cans were strewn all over the carpet.
Hardly looking up, he (<font color='blue'><b>Gabe</b></font>) said around his (<font color='blue'><b>Gabe</b></font>) cigar, <div class="bookquote">``So, you're home.''
 (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``Where's my mom?''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``Working,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Gabe</b></font>) said. <div class="bookquote">``You got any cash?''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>That was it. No Welcome back. Good to see you. How has your life been the last six months?
Gabe had put on weight. He (<font color='blue'><b>Gabe</b></font>) looked like a tuskless walrus in thrift-store clothes. He (<font color='blue'><b>Gabe</b></font>) had about
three hairs on his (<font color='blue'><b>Gabe</b></font>) head, all combed over his (<font color='blue'><b>Gabe</b></font>) bald scalp, as if that made him (<font color='blue'><b>Gabe</b></font>) handsome or something.
He (<font color='blue'><b>Gabe</b></font>) managed the Electronics Mega-Mart in Queens, but he (<font color='blue'><b>Gabe</b></font>) stayed home most of the time. I don't

<p/>know why he (<font color='blue'><b>Gabe</b></font>) hadn't been fired long before. He (<font color='blue'><b>Gabe</b></font>) just kept on collecting paychecks, spending the money
on cigars that made me nauseous, and on beer, of course. Always beer. Whenever I was home, he (<font color='blue'><b>Gabe</b></font>)
expected me to provide his (<font color='blue'><b>Gabe</b></font>) gambling funds. He (<font color='blue'><b>Gabe</b></font>) called that our <div class="bookquote">``guy secret.''  (<font color='red'><b>He</b></font>)</div>Meaning, if I told my
mom, he (<font color='blue'><b>Gabe</b></font>) would punch my lights out.
<div class="bookquote">``I don't have any cash,''  (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div>I told him (<font color='blue'><b>Gabe</b></font>).
He (<font color='blue'><b>Gabe</b></font>) raised a greasy eyebrow.
Gabe could sniff out money like a bloodhound, which was surprising, since his (<font color='blue'><b>Gabe</b></font>) own smell
should've covered up everything else.
<div class="bookquote">``You took a taxi from the bus station,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Gabe</b></font>) said. Probably paid with a twenty. Got six, seven bucks
in change. Somebody expects to live under this roof, he (<font color='blue'><b>Gabe</b></font>) ought to carry his (<font color='blue'><b>Gabe</b></font>) own weight. Am I right,
Eddie?''
Eddie, the super of the apartment building, looked at me with a twinge of sympathy. ``Come on,
Gabe,'' he (<font color='blue'><b>Eddie</b></font>) said. ``The kid just got here.''
``Am I right?'' Gabe repeated.
Eddie scowled into his (<font color='blue'><b>Eddie</b></font>) bowl of pretzels. The other two guys passed gas in harmony.
``Fine,'' I said. I dug a wad of dollars out of my pocket and threw the money on the table. ``I hope
you lose.''
``Your report card came, brain boy!'' he (<font color='blue'><b>Gabe</b></font>) shouted after me. ``I wouldn't act so snooty!''
I slammed the door to my room, which really wasn't my room. During school months, it was
Gabe's ``study.'' He (<font color='blue'><b>Gabe</b></font>) didn't study anything in there except old car magazines, but he (<font color='blue'><b>Gabe</b></font>) loved shoving my
stuff in the closet, leaving his (<font color='blue'><b>Gabe</b></font>) muddy boots on my windowsill, and doing his (<font color='blue'><b>Gabe</b></font>) best to make the place
smell like his (<font color='blue'><b>Gabe</b></font>) nasty cologne and cigars and stale beer.
I dropped my suitcase on the bed. Home sweet home.
Gabe's smell was almost worse than the nightmares about Mrs. Dodds, or the sound of that old
fruit lady's shears snipping the yarn.
But as soon as I thought that, my legs felt weak. I remembered Grover's look of panic-how he (<font color='blue'><b>Grover</b></font>)'d
made me promise I wouldn't go home without him (<font color='blue'><b>Grover</b></font>). A sudden chill rolled through me. I felt like
someone-something-was looking for me right now, maybe pounding its way up the stairs, growing
long, horrible talons.
Then I heard my mom's voice. ``Percy?''
She (<font color='blue'><b>mom</b></font>) opened the bedroom door, and my fears melted.
My mother can make me feel good just by walking into the room. Her (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) eyes sparkle and change
color in the light. Her (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) smile is as warm as a quilt. She (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>)'s got a few gray streaks mixed in with her (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) long
brown hair, but I never think of her (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) as old. When she (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) looks at me, it's like she (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>)'s seeing all the good
things about me, none of the bad. I've never heard her (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) raise her (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) voice or say an unkind word to
anyone, not even me or Gabe.
``Oh, Percy.'' She (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) hugged me tight. ``I can't believe it. You've grown since Christmas!''
Her (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) red-white-and-blue Sweet on America uniform smelled like the best things in the world:
chocolate, licorice, and all the other stuff she (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) sold at the candy shop in Grand Central. She (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>)'d brought
me a huge bag of <div class="bookquote">``free samples,''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>the way she (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) always did when I came home.
We sat together on the edge of the bed. While I attacked the blueberry sour strings, she (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) ran her (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>)
hand through my hair and demanded to know everything I hadn't put in my letters. She (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) didn't mention
anything about my getting expelled. She (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) didn't seem to care about that. But was I okay? Was her (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) little
boy doing all right?
I told her (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) she (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) was smothering me, and to lay off and all that, but secretly, I was really, really glad

<p/>to see her (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>).
From the other room, Gabe yelled, <div class="bookquote">``Hey, Sally-how about some bean dip, huh?''
 (<font color='red'><b>Gabe/Gabe Ugliano</b></font>)</div>I gritted my teeth.
My mom is the nicest lady in the world. She (<font color='blue'><b>mom</b></font>) should've been married to a millionaire, not to some
jerk like Gabe.
For her (<font color='blue'><b>mom</b></font>) sake, I tried to sound upbeat about my last days at Yancy Academy. I told her (<font color='blue'><b>mom</b></font>) I wasn't too
down about the expulsion. I'd lasted almost the whole year this time. I'd made some new friends. I'd
done pretty well in Latin. And honestly, the fights hadn't been as bad as the headmaster said. I liked
Yancy Academy. I really did. I put such a good spin on the year, I almost convinced myself. I started
choking up, thinking about Grover and Mr. Brunner. Even Nancy Bobofit suddenly didn't seem so
bad.
Until that trip to the museum ...
<div class="bookquote">``What?''  (<font color='red'><b>mom</b></font>)</div>my mom asked. Her (<font color='blue'><b>mom</b></font>) eyes tugged at my conscience, trying to pull out the secrets. <div class="bookquote">``Did
something scare you?''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``No, Mom.''
 (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div>I felt bad lying. I wanted to tell her (<font color='blue'><b>mom</b></font>) about Mrs. Dodds and the three old ladies with the yarn, but I
thought it would sound stupid.
She (<font color='blue'><b>mom</b></font>) pursed her (<font color='blue'><b>mom</b></font>) lips. She (<font color='blue'><b>mom</b></font>) knew I was holding back, but she (<font color='blue'><b>mom</b></font>) didn't push me.
<div class="bookquote">``I have a surprise for you,''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>mom</b></font>) said. <div class="bookquote">``We're going to the beach.''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>My eyes widened. <div class="bookquote">``Montauk?''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``Three nights-same cabin.''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``When?''
 (<font color='red'><b>She</b></font>)</div>She (<font color='blue'><b>mom</b></font>) smiled. <div class="bookquote">``As soon as I get changed.''
 (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div>I couldn't believe it. My mom and I hadn't been to Montauk the last two summers, because Gabe
said there wasn't enough money.
Gabe appeared in the doorway and growled, <div class="bookquote">``Bean dip, Sally? Didn't you hear me?''
 (<font color='red'><b>Gabe/Gabe Ugliano</b></font>)</div>I wanted to punch him (<font color='blue'><b>Gabe</b></font>), but I met my mom's eyes and I understood she (<font color='blue'><b>mom</b></font>) was offering me a deal: be
nice to Gabe for a little while. Just until she (<font color='blue'><b>mom</b></font>) was ready to leave for Montauk. Then we would get out
of here.
<div class="bookquote">``I was on my way, honey,''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>mom</b></font>) told Gabe. <div class="bookquote">``We were just talking about the trip.''
 (<font color='red'><b>Gabe/Gabe Ugliano</b></font>)</div>Gabe's eyes got small. <div class="bookquote">``The trip? You mean you were serious about that?''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``I knew it,''  (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div>I muttered. <div class="bookquote">``He (<font color='blue'><b>Bean</b></font>) won't let us go.''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``Of course he (<font color='blue'><b>Bean</b></font>) will,''  (<font color='red'><b>mom</b></font>)</div>my mom said evenly. <div class="bookquote">``Your stepfather is just worried about money. That's
all. Besides,''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>mom</b></font>) added, <div class="bookquote">``Gabriel won't have to settle for bean dip. I'll make him (<font color='blue'><b>Gabriel</b></font>) enough sevenlayer dip for the whole weekend. Guacamole. Sour cream. The works.''
 (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>Gabe softened a bit. <div class="bookquote">``So this money for your trip ... it comes out of your clothes budget, right?''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``Yes, honey,''  (<font color='red'><b>mother</b></font>)</div>my mother said.
<div class="bookquote">``And you won't take my car anywhere but there and back.''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``We'll be very careful.''
 (<font color='red'><b>Gabe/Gabe Ugliano</b></font>)</div>Gabe scratched his (<font color='blue'><b>Gabe</b></font>) double chin. <div class="bookquote">``Maybe if you hurry with that seven-layer dip ... And maybe if
the kid apologizes for interrupting my poker game.''
 (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div>Maybe if I kick you in your soft spot, I thought. And make you sing soprano for a week.
But my mom's eyes warned me not to make him (<font color='blue'><b>Gabe</b></font>) mad.
Why did she (<font color='blue'><b>mom</b></font>) put up with this guy? I wanted to scream. Why did she (<font color='blue'><b>mom</b></font>) care what he (<font color='blue'><b>Gabe</b></font>) thought?
<div class="bookquote">``I'm sorry,''  (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div>I muttered. ``I'm really sorry I interrupted your incredibly important poker game.

<p/>Please go back to it right now.''
Gabe's eyes narrowed. His (<font color='blue'><b>Gabe</b></font>) tiny brain was probably trying to detect sarcasm in my statement.
``Yeah, whatever,'' he (<font color='blue'><b>Gabe</b></font>) decided.
He (<font color='blue'><b>Gabe</b></font>) went back to his (<font color='blue'><b>Gabe</b></font>) game.
``Thank you, Percy,'' my mom said. ``Once we get to Montauk, we'll talk more about... whatever
you've forgotten to tell me, okay?''
For a moment, I thought I saw anxiety in her (<font color='blue'><b>mom</b></font>) eyes-the same fear I'd seen in Grover during the bus
ride-as if my mom too felt an odd chill in the air.
But then her (<font color='blue'><b>mom</b></font>) smile returned, and I figured I must have been mistaken. She (<font color='blue'><b>mom</b></font>) ruffled my hair and went
to make Gabe his (<font color='blue'><b>Gabe</b></font>) seven-layer dip.
An hour later we were ready to leave.
Gabe took a break from his (<font color='blue'><b>Gabe</b></font>) poker game long enough to watch me lug my mom's bags to the car.
He (<font color='blue'><b>Gabe</b></font>) kept griping and groaning about losing her (<font color='blue'><b>mom</b></font>) cooking-and more important, his (<font color='blue'><b>Gabe</b></font>) `78 Camaro-for the
whole weekend.
``Not a scratch on this car, brain boy,'' he (<font color='blue'><b>Gabe</b></font>) warned me as I loaded the last bag. <div class="bookquote">``Not one little
scratch.''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>Like I'd be the one driving. I was twelve. But that didn't matter to Gabe. If a seagull so much as
pooped on his (<font color='blue'><b>Gabe</b></font>) paint job, he (<font color='blue'><b>Gabe</b></font>)'d find a way to blame me.
Watching him (<font color='blue'><b>Gabe</b></font>) lumber back toward the apartment building, I got so mad I did something I can't
explain. As Gabe reached the doorway, I made the hand gesture I'd seen Grover make on the bus, a
sort of warding-off-evil gesture, a clawed hand over my heart, then a shoving movement toward
Gabe. The screen door slammed shut so hard it whacked him (<font color='blue'><b>Gabe</b></font>) in the butt and sent him (<font color='blue'><b>Gabe</b></font>) flying up the
staircase as if he (<font color='blue'><b>Gabe</b></font>)'d been shot from a cannon. Maybe it was just the wind, or some freak accident with
the hinges, but I didn't stay long enough to find out.
I got in the Camaro and told my mom to step on it.
Our rental cabin was on the south shore, way out at the tip of Long Island. It was a little pastel
box with faded curtains, half sunken into the dunes. There was always sand in the sheets and spiders
in the cabinets, and most of the time the sea was too cold to swim in.
I loved the place.
We'd been going there since I was a baby. My mom had been going even longer. She (<font color='blue'><b>mom</b></font>) never
exactly said, but I knew why the beach was special to her (<font color='blue'><b>mom</b></font>). It was the place where she (<font color='blue'><b>mom</b></font>)'d met my dad.
As we got closer to Montauk, she (<font color='blue'><b>mom</b></font>) seemed to grow younger, years of worry and work disappearing
from her (<font color='blue'><b>mom</b></font>) face. Her (<font color='blue'><b>mom</b></font>) eyes turned the color of the sea.
We got there at sunset, opened all the cabin's windows, and went through our usual cleaning
routine. We walked on the beach, fed blue corn chips to the seagulls, and munched on blue jelly
beans, blue saltwater taffy, and all the other free samples my mom had brought from work.
I guess I should explain the blue food.
See, Gabe had once told my mom there was no such thing. They had this fight, which seemed like
a really small thing at the time. But ever since, my mom went out of her (<font color='blue'><b>mom</b></font>) way to eat blue. She (<font color='blue'><b>mom</b></font>) baked
blue birthday cakes. She (<font color='blue'><b>mom</b></font>) mixed blueberry smoothies. She (<font color='blue'><b>mom</b></font>) bought blue-corn tortilla chips and brought
home blue candy from the shop. This-along with keeping her (<font color='blue'><b>mom</b></font>) maiden name, Jackson, rather than
calling herself Mrs. Ugliano-was proof that she (<font color='blue'><b>mom</b></font>) wasn't totally suckered by Gabe. She (<font color='blue'><b>mom</b></font>) did have a
rebellious streak, like me.
When it got dark, we made a fire. We roasted hot dogs and marshmallows. Mom told me stories
about when she (<font color='blue'><b>Mom</b></font>) was a kid, back before her (<font color='blue'><b>Mom</b></font>) parents died in the plane crash. She (<font color='blue'><b>Mom</b></font>) told me about the

<p/>books she (<font color='blue'><b>Mom</b></font>) wanted to write someday, when she (<font color='blue'><b>Mom</b></font>) had enough money to quit the candy shop.
Eventually, I got up the nerve to ask about what was always on my mind whenever we came to
Montauk-my father. Mom's eyes went all misty. I figured she (<font color='blue'><b>Mom</b></font>) would tell me the same things she (<font color='blue'><b>Mom</b></font>)
always did, but I never got tired of hearing them.
<div class="bookquote">``He (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>) was kind, Percy,''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Mom</b></font>) said. <div class="bookquote">``Tall, handsome, and powerful. But gentle, too. You have his (<font color='blue'><b>Percy</b></font>)
black hair, you know, and his (<font color='blue'><b>Percy</b></font>) green eyes.''
 (<font color='red'><b>Mom</b></font>)</div>Mom fished a blue jelly bean out of her (<font color='blue'><b>Mom</b></font>) candy bag. <div class="bookquote">``I wish he (<font color='blue'><b>Percy</b></font>) could see you, Percy. He (<font color='blue'><b>Percy</b></font>) would be
so proud.''
 (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div>I wondered how she (<font color='blue'><b>Mom</b></font>) could say that. What was so great about me? A dyslexic, hyperactive boy
with a D+ report card, kicked out of school for the sixth time in six years.
<div class="bookquote">``How old was I?''  (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div>I asked. <div class="bookquote">``I mean ... when he (<font color='blue'><b>Percy</b></font>) left?''
 (<font color='red'><b>She</b></font>)</div>She (<font color='blue'><b>Mom</b></font>) watched the flames. <div class="bookquote">``He (<font color='blue'><b>Percy</b></font>) was only with me for one summer, Percy. Right here at this beach.
This cabin.''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``But... he (<font color='blue'><b>Percy</b></font>) knew me as a baby.''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``No, honey. He (<font color='blue'><b>Percy</b></font>) knew I was expecting a baby, but he (<font color='blue'><b>Percy</b></font>) never saw you. He (<font color='blue'><b>Percy</b></font>) had to leave before you
were born.''
 (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div>I tried to square that with the fact that I seemed to remember ... something about my father. A
warm glow. A smile.
I had always assumed he (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) knew me as a baby. My mom had never said it outright, but still, I'd felt
it must be true. Now, to be told that he (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>)'d never even seen me ...
I felt angry at my father. Maybe it was stupid, but I resented him (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) for going on that ocean voyage,
for not having the guts to marry my mom. He (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>)'d left us, and now we were stuck with Smelly Gabe.
<div class="bookquote">``Are you going to send me away again?''  (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div>I asked her (<font color='blue'><b>mom</b></font>). <div class="bookquote">``To another boarding school?''
 (<font color='red'><b>She</b></font>)</div>She (<font color='blue'><b>mom</b></font>) pulled a marshmallow from the fire.
<div class="bookquote">``I don't know, honey.''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>Her (<font color='blue'><b>mom</b></font>) voice was heavy. <div class="bookquote">``I think ... I think we'll have to do something.''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``Because you don't want me around?''  (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div>I regretted the words as soon as they were out.
My mom's eyes welled with tears. She (<font color='blue'><b>mom</b></font>) took my hand, squeezed it tight. <div class="bookquote">``Oh, Percy, no. I-I have
to, honey. For your own good. I have to send you away.''
 (<font color='red'><b>me</b></font>)</div>Her (<font color='blue'><b>mom</b></font>) words reminded me of what Mr. Brunner had said-that it was best for me to leave Yancy.
<div class="bookquote">``Because I'm not normal,''  (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div>I said.
<div class="bookquote">``You say that as if it's a bad thing, Percy. But you don't realize how important you are. I thought
Yancy Academy would be far enough away. I thought you'd finally be safe.''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``Safe from what?''
 (<font color='red'><b>She</b></font>)</div>She (<font color='blue'><b>mom</b></font>) met my eyes, and a flood of memories came back to me-all the weird, scary things that had
ever happened to me, some of which I'd tried to forget.
During third grade, a man in a black trench coat had stalked me on the playground. When the
teachers threatened to call the police, he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) went away growling, but no one believed me when I told
them that under his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) broad-brimmed hat, the man only had one eye, right in the middle of his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) head.
Before that-a really early memory. I was in preschool, and a teacher accidentally put me down for
a nap in a cot that a snake had slithered into. My mom screamed when she (<font color='blue'><b>mom</b></font>) came to pick me up and
found me playing with a limp, scaly rope I'd somehow managed to strangle to death with my meaty
toddler hands.
In every single school, something creepy had happened, something unsafe, and I was forced to
move.
I knew I should tell my mom about the old ladies at the fruit stand, and Mrs. Dodds at the art

<p/>museum, about my weird hallucination that I had sliced my math teacher into dust with a sword. But I
couldn't make myself tell her (<font color='blue'><b>Dodds</b></font>). I had a strange feeling the news would end our trip to Montauk, and I
didn't want that.
<div class="bookquote">``I've tried to keep you as close to me as I could,''  (<font color='red'><b>mom</b></font>)</div>my mom said. <div class="bookquote">``They told me that was a
mistake. But there's only one other option, Percy-the place your father wanted to send you. And I
just... I just can't stand to do it.''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``My father wanted me to go to a special school?''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``Not a school,''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>mom</b></font>) said softly. <div class="bookquote">``A summer camp.''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>My head was spinning. Why would my dad-who hadn't even stayed around long enough to see me
born- talk to my mom about a summer camp? And if it was so important, why hadn't she (<font color='blue'><b>mom</b></font>) ever
mentioned it before?
<div class="bookquote">``I'm sorry, Percy,''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>mom</b></font>) said, seeing the look in my eyes. <div class="bookquote">``But I can't talk about it. I-I couldn't
send you to that place. It might mean saying good-bye to you for good.''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``For good? But if it's only a summer camp ...''
 (<font color='red'><b>She</b></font>)</div>She (<font color='blue'><b>mom</b></font>) turned toward the fire, and I knew from her (<font color='blue'><b>mom</b></font>) expression that if I asked her (<font color='blue'><b>mom</b></font>) any more questions
she (<font color='blue'><b>mom</b></font>) would start to cry.
That night I had a vivid dream.
It was storming on the beach, and two beautiful animals, a white horse and a golden eagle, were
trying to kill each other at the edge of the surf. The eagle swooped down and slashed the horse's
muzzle with its huge talons. The horse reared up and kicked at the eagles wings. As they fought, the
ground rumbled, and a monstrous voice chuckled somewhere beneath the earth, goading the animals to
fight harder.
I ran toward them, knowing I had to stop them from killing each other, but I was running in slow
motion. I knew I would be too late. I saw the eagle dive down, its beak aimed at the horse's wide
eyes, and I screamed, No!
I woke with a start.
Outside, it really was storming, the kind of storm that cracks trees and blows down houses. There
was no horse or eagle on the beach, just lightning making false daylight, and twenty-foot waves
pounding the dunes like artillery.
With the next thunderclap, my mom woke. She (<font color='blue'><b>mom</b></font>) sat up, eyes wide, and said, <div class="bookquote">``Hurricane.''
 (<font color='red'><b>She</b></font>)</div>I knew that was crazy. Long Island never sees hurricanes this early in the summer. But the ocean
seemed to have forgotten. Over the roar of the wind, I heard a distant bellow, an angry, tortured sound
that made my hair stand on end.
Then a much closer noise, like mallets in the sand. A desperate voice-someone yelling, pounding
on our cabin door.
My mother sprang out of bed in her (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) nightgown and threw open the lock.
Grover stood framed in the doorway against a backdrop of pouring rain. But he (<font color='blue'><b>Grover</b></font>) wasn't... he (<font color='blue'><b>Grover</b></font>)
wasn't exactly Grover.
<div class="bookquote">``Searching all night,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Grover</b></font>) gasped. <div class="bookquote">``What were you thinking?''
 (<font color='red'><b>mother</b></font>)</div>My mother looked at me in terror-not scared of Grover, but of why he (<font color='blue'><b>Grover</b></font>)'d come.
<div class="bookquote">``Percy,''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) said, shouting to be heard over the rain. <div class="bookquote">``What happened at school? What didn't you
tell me?''
 (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div>I was frozen, looking at Grover. I couldn't understand what I was seeing.
<div class="bookquote">``O Zeu kai alloi theoi!''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Grover</b></font>) yelled. <div class="bookquote">``It's right behind me! Didn't you tell her (<font color='blue'><b>it</b></font>)?''
 (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div>I was too shocked to register that he (<font color='blue'><b>Grover</b></font>)'d just cursed in Ancient Greek, and I'd understood him (<font color='blue'><b>Grover</b></font>)

<p/>perfectly. I was too shocked to wonder how Grover had gotten here by himself in the middle of the
night. Because Grover didn't have his (<font color='blue'><b>Grover</b></font>) pants on-and where his (<font color='blue'><b>Grover</b></font>) legs should be ... where his (<font color='blue'><b>Grover</b></font>) legs
should be ...
My mom looked at me sternly and talked in a tone she (<font color='blue'><b>mom</b></font>)'d never used before: <div class="bookquote">``Percy. Tell me
now!''
 (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>I stammered something about the old ladies at the fruit stand, and Mrs. Dodds, and my mom stared
at me, her (<font color='blue'><b>mom</b></font>) face deathly pale in the flashes of lightning.
She (<font color='blue'><b>mom</b></font>) grabbed her (<font color='blue'><b>mom</b></font>) purse, tossed me my rain jacket, and said, <div class="bookquote">``Get to the car. Both of you. Go!''
 (<font color='red'><b>me</b></font>)</div>Grover ran for the Camaro-but he (<font color='blue'><b>Grover</b></font>) wasn't running, exactly. He (<font color='blue'><b>Grover</b></font>) was trotting, shaking his (<font color='blue'><b>Grover</b></font>) shaggy
hindquarters, and suddenly his (<font color='blue'><b>Grover</b></font>) story about a muscular disorder in his (<font color='blue'><b>Grover</b></font>) legs made sense to me. I
understood how he (<font color='blue'><b>Grover</b></font>) could run so fast and still limp when he (<font color='blue'><b>Grover</b></font>) walked.
Because where his (<font color='blue'><b>Grover</b></font>) feet should be, there were no feet. There were cloven hooves.

<p/>Percy Jackson 1 - The Lightning Thief
4 MY MOTHER TEACHES
ME BULLFIGHTING
We tore through the night along dark country roads. Wind slammed against the Camaro. Rain
lashed the windshield. I didn't know how my mom could see anything, but she (<font color='blue'><b>mom</b></font>) kept her (<font color='blue'><b>mom</b></font>) foot on the
gas.
Every time there was a flash of lightning, I looked at Grover sitting next to me in the backseat and
I wondered if I'd gone insane, or if he (<font color='blue'><b>Grover</b></font>) was wearing some kind of shag-carpet pants. But, no, the smell
was one I remembered from kindergarten field trips to the petting zoo- lanolin, like from wool. The
smell of a wet barnyard animal.
All I could think to say was, <div class="bookquote">``So, you and my mom... know each other?''
 (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div>Graver's eyes flitted to the rearview mirror, though there were no cars behind us. <div class="bookquote">``Not exactly,''
 (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Grover</b></font>) said. <div class="bookquote">``I mean, we've never met in person. But she (<font color='blue'><b>mom</b></font>) knew I was watching you.''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``Watching me?''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``Keeping tabs on you. Making sure you were okay. But I wasn't faking being your friend,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Grover</b></font>)
added hastily. <div class="bookquote">``I am your friend.''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``Urn ... what are you, exactly?''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``That doesn't matter right now.''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>``It doesn't matter? From the waist down, my best friend is a donkey-``
Grover let out a sharp, throaty <div class="bookquote">``Blaa-ha-ha!''
 (<font color='red'><b>Grover</b></font>)</div>I'd heard him (<font color='blue'><b>Grover</b></font>) make that sound before, but I'd always assumed it was a nervous laugh. Now I
realized it was more of an irritated bleat.
<div class="bookquote">``Goat!''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Grover</b></font>) cried.
<div class="bookquote">``What?''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``I'm a goat from the waist down.''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``You just said it didn't matter.''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``Blaa-ha-ha! There are satyrs who would trample you underhoof for such an insult!''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``Whoa. Wait. Satyrs. You mean like ... Mr. Brunner's myths?''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``Were those old ladies at the fruit stand a myth, Percy? Was Mrs. Dodds a myth?''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``So you admit there was a Mrs. Dodds!''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``Of course.''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>``Then why-``
<div class="bookquote">``The less you knew, the fewer monsters you'd attract,''  (<font color='red'><b>Grover/Grover Underwood/GROVER</b></font>)</div>Grover said, like that should be perfectly
obvious. <div class="bookquote">``We put Mist over the humans' eyes. We hoped you'd think the Kindly One was a
hallucination. But it was no good. You started to realize who you are.''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``Who I-wait a minute, what do you mean?''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>The weird bellowing noise rose up again somewhere behind us, closer than before. Whatever
was chasing us was still on our trail.
<div class="bookquote">``Percy,''  (<font color='red'><b>mom</b></font>)</div>my mom said, <div class="bookquote">``there's too much to explain and not enough time. We have to get you to
safety.''
 (<font color='red'><b>mom</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``Safety from what? Who's after me?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Oh, nobody much,''  (<font color='red'><b>Grover/Grover Underwood/GROVER</b></font>)</div>Grover said, obviously still miffed about the donkey comment. <div class="bookquote">``Just the Lord
of the Dead and a few of his (<font color='blue'><b>Lord</b></font>) blood-thirstiest minions.''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``Grover!''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``Sorry, Mrs. Jackson. Could you drive faster, please?''
 (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div>I tried to wrap my mind around what was happening, but I couldn't do it. I knew this wasn't a
dream. I had no imagination. I could never dream up something this weird.
My mom made a hard left. We swerved onto a narrower road, racing past darkened farmhouses
and wooded hills and PICK YOUR OWN STRAWBERRIES signs on white picket fences.
<div class="bookquote">``Where are we going?''  (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div>I asked.
<div class="bookquote">``The summer camp I told you about.''  (<font color='red'><b>mother</b></font>)</div>My mother's voice was tight; she (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) was trying for my sake not
to be scared. <div class="bookquote">``The place your father wanted to send you.''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``The place you didn't want me to go.''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``Please, dear,''  (<font color='red'><b>mother</b></font>)</div>my mother begged. <div class="bookquote">``This is hard enough. Try to understand. You're in danger.''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``Because some old ladies cut yarn.''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``Those weren't old ladies,''  (<font color='red'><b>Grover/Grover Underwood/GROVER</b></font>)</div>Grover said. <div class="bookquote">``Those were the Fates. Do you know what it means-the
fact they appeared in front of you? They only do that when you're about to ... when someone's about
to die.''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>``Whoa. You said `you.'''
``No I didn't. I said 'someone.'''
<div class="bookquote">``You meant `you.' As in me.''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``I meant you, like 'someone.' Not you, you.''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``Boys!''  (<font color='red'><b>mom</b></font>)</div>my mom said.
She (<font color='blue'><b>mom</b></font>) pulled the wheel hard to the right, and I got a glimpse of a figure she (<font color='blue'><b>mom</b></font>)'d swerved to avoid-a
dark fluttering shape now lost behind us in the storm.
<div class="bookquote">``What was that?''  (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div>I asked.
<div class="bookquote">``We're almost there,''  (<font color='red'><b>mother</b></font>)</div>my mother said, ignoring my question. <div class="bookquote">``Another mile. Please. Please.
Please.''
 (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div>I didn't know where there was, but I found myself leaning forward in the car, anticipating,
wanting us to arrive.
Outside, nothing but rain and darkness-the kind of empty countryside you get way out on the tip of
Long Island. I thought about Mrs. Dodds and the moment when she (<font color='blue'><b>Dodds</b></font>)'d changed into the thing with
pointed teeth and leathery wings. My limbs went numb from delayed shock. She (<font color='blue'><b>Dodds</b></font>) really hadn't been
human. She (<font color='blue'><b>Dodds</b></font>)'d meant to kill me.
Then I thought about Mr. Brunner ... and the sword he (<font color='blue'><b>Brunner</b></font>) had thrown me. Before I could ask Grover
about that, the hair rose on the back of my neck. There was a blinding flash, a jaw-rattling boom!, and
our car exploded.
I remember feeling weightless, like I was being crushed, fried, and hosed down all at the same
time.
I peeled my forehead off the back of the driver's seat and said, <div class="bookquote">``Ow.''
 (<font color='red'><b>the driver</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``Percy!''  (<font color='red'><b>mom</b></font>)</div>my mom shouted.
<div class="bookquote">``I'm okay... .''
 (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div>I tried to shake off the daze. I wasn't dead. The car hadn't really exploded. We'd swerved into a
ditch. Our driver's-side doors were wedged in the mud. The roof had cracked open like an eggshell
and rain was pouring in.
Lightning. That was the only explanation. We'd been blasted right off the road. Next to me in the

<p/>backseat was a big motionless lump. <div class="bookquote">``Grover!''
 (<font color='red'><b>He</b></font>)</div>He (<font color='blue'><b>driver</b></font>) was slumped over, blood trickling from the side of his (<font color='blue'><b>driver</b></font>) mouth. I shook his (<font color='blue'><b>driver</b></font>) furry hip, thinking,
No! Even if you are half barnyard animal, you're my best friend and I don't want you to die!
Then he (<font color='blue'><b>friend</b></font>) groaned <div class="bookquote">``Food,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>and I knew there was hope.
<div class="bookquote">``Percy,''  (<font color='red'><b>mother</b></font>)</div>my mother said, <div class="bookquote">``we have to ...''  (<font color='red'><b>mother</b></font>)</div>Her (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) voice faltered.
I looked back. In a flash of lightning, through the mud-spattered rear windshield, I saw a figure
lumbering toward us on the shoulder of the road. The sight of it made my skin crawl. It was a dark
silhouette of a huge guy, like a football player. He (<font color='blue'><b>player</b></font>) seemed to be holding a blanket over his (<font color='blue'><b>player</b></font>) head. His (<font color='blue'><b>player</b></font>)
top half was bulky and fuzzy. His (<font color='blue'><b>player</b></font>) upraised hands made it look like he (<font color='blue'><b>player</b></font>) had horns.
I swallowed hard. ``Who is-``
<div class="bookquote">``Percy,''  (<font color='red'><b>mother</b></font>)</div>my mother said, deadly serious. <div class="bookquote">``Get out of the car.''
 (<font color='red'><b>mother</b></font>)</div>My mother threw herself against the driver's-side door. It was jammed shut in the mud. I tried
mine. Stuck too. I looked up desperately at the hole in the roof. It might've been an exit, but the edges
were sizzling and smoking.
<div class="bookquote">``Climb out the passenger's side!''  (<font color='red'><b>mother</b></font>)</div>my mother told me. <div class="bookquote">``Percy-you have to run. Do you see that big
tree?''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``What?''
 (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div>Another flash of lightning, and through the smoking hole in the roof I saw the tree she (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) meant: a
huge, White House Christmas tree-sized pine at the crest of the nearest hill.
<div class="bookquote">``That's the property line,''  (<font color='red'><b>mom</b></font>)</div>my mom said. <div class="bookquote">``Get over that hill and you'll see a big farmhouse down
in the valley. Run and don't look back. Yell for help. Don't stop until you reach the door.''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``Mom, you're coming too.''
 (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>Her (<font color='blue'><b>mom</b></font>) face was pale, her (<font color='blue'><b>mom</b></font>) eyes as sad as when she (<font color='blue'><b>mom</b></font>) looked at the ocean.
<div class="bookquote">``No!''  (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div>I shouted. <div class="bookquote">``You are coming with me. Help me carry Grover.''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``Food!''  (<font color='red'><b>Grover/Grover Underwood/GROVER</b></font>)</div>Grover moaned, a little louder.
The man with the blanket on his (<font color='blue'><b>Grover</b></font>) head kept coming toward us, making his (<font color='blue'><b>Grover</b></font>) grunting, snorting noises.
As he (<font color='blue'><b>Grover</b></font>) got closer, I realized he (<font color='blue'><b>Grover</b></font>) couldn't be holding a blanket over his (<font color='blue'><b>Grover</b></font>) head, because his (<font color='blue'><b>Grover</b></font>) hands-huge
meaty hands-were swinging at his (<font color='blue'><b>Grover</b></font>) sides. There was no blanket. Meaning the bulky, fuzzy mass that
was too big to be his (<font color='blue'><b>Grover</b></font>) head ... was his (<font color='blue'><b>Grover</b></font>) head. And the points that looked like horns ...
<div class="bookquote">``He (<font color='blue'><b>Grover</b></font>) doesn't want us,''  (<font color='red'><b>mother</b></font>)</div>my mother told me. <div class="bookquote">``He (<font color='blue'><b>Grover</b></font>) wants you. Besides, I can't cross the property
line.''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``But...''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``We don't have time, Percy. Go. Please.''
 (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div>I got mad, then-mad at my mother, at Grover the goat, at the thing with horns that was lumbering
toward us slowly and deliberately like, like a bull.
I climbed across Grover and pushed the door open into the rain. <div class="bookquote">``We're going together. Come on,
Mom.''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>``I told you-``
<div class="bookquote">``Mom! I am not leaving you. Help me with Grover.''
 (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div>I didn't wait for her (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) answer. I scrambled outside, dragging Grover from the car. He (<font color='blue'><b>Grover</b></font>) was
surprisingly light, but I couldn't have carried him (<font color='blue'><b>Grover</b></font>) very far if my mom hadn't come to my aid.
Together, we draped Grover's arms over our shoulders and started stumbling uphill through wet
waist-high grass.
Glancing back, I got my first clear look at the monster. He (<font color='blue'><b>Grover</b></font>) was seven feet tall, easy, his (<font color='blue'><b>Grover</b></font>) arms and
legs like something from the cover of Muscle Man magazine-bulging biceps and triceps and a bunch

<p/>of other `ceps, all stuffed like baseballs under vein-webbed skin. He (<font color='blue'><b>Grover</b></font>) wore no clothes except
underwear-I mean, bright white Fruit of the Looms-which would've looked funny, except that the top
half of his (<font color='blue'><b>Grover</b></font>) body was so scary. Coarse brown hair started at about his (<font color='blue'><b>Grover</b></font>) belly button and got thicker as it
reached his (<font color='blue'><b>Grover</b></font>) shoulders.
His (<font color='blue'><b>Grover</b></font>) neck was a mass of muscle and fur leading up to his (<font color='blue'><b>Grover</b></font>) enormous head, which had a snout as
long as my arm, snotty nostrils with a gleaming brass ring, cruel black eyes, and horns-enormous
black-and-white horns with points you just couldn't get from an electric sharpener.
I recognized the monster, all right. He (<font color='blue'><b>Grover</b></font>) had been in one of the first stories Mr. Brunner told us. But
he (<font color='blue'><b>Brunner</b></font>) couldn't be real.
I blinked the rain out of my eyes. ``That's-``
<div class="bookquote">``Pasiphae's son,''  (<font color='red'><b>mother</b></font>)</div>my mother said. <div class="bookquote">``I wish I'd known how badly they want to kill you.''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>``But he (<font color='blue'><b>Grover</b></font>)'s the Min-``
<div class="bookquote">``Don't say his (<font color='blue'><b>Min</b></font>) name,''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) warned. <div class="bookquote">``Names have power.''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>The pine tree was still way too far-a hundred yards uphill at least.
I glanced behind me again.
The bull-man hunched over our car, looking in the windows-or not looking, exactly. More like
snuffling, nuzzling. I wasn't sure why he (<font color='blue'><b>Brunner</b></font>) bothered, since we were only about fifty feet away.
<div class="bookquote">``Food?''  (<font color='red'><b>Grover/Grover Underwood/GROVER</b></font>)</div>Grover moaned.
<div class="bookquote">``Shhh,''  (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div>I told him (<font color='blue'><b>Grover</b></font>). <div class="bookquote">``Mom, what's he (<font color='blue'><b>Min</b></font>) doing? Doesn't he (<font color='blue'><b>Min</b></font>) see us?''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``His (<font color='blue'><b>Min</b></font>) sight and hearing are terrible,''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) said. <div class="bookquote">``He (<font color='blue'><b>Min</b></font>) goes by smell. But he (<font color='blue'><b>Min</b></font>)'ll figure out where we
are soon enough.''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>As if on cue, the bull-man bellowed in rage. He (<font color='blue'><b>Grover</b></font>) picked up Gabe's Camaro by the torn roof, the
chassis creaking and groaning. He (<font color='blue'><b>Grover</b></font>) raised the car over his (<font color='blue'><b>Grover</b></font>) head and threw it down the road. It
slammed into the wet asphalt and skidded in a shower of sparks for about half a mile before coming
to a stop. The gas tank exploded.
Not a scratch, I remembered Gabe saying.
Oops.
<div class="bookquote">``Percy,''  (<font color='red'><b>mom</b></font>)</div>my mom said. <div class="bookquote">``When he (<font color='blue'><b>Percy</b></font>) sees us, he (<font color='blue'><b>Percy</b></font>)'ll charge. Wait until the last second, then jump out
of the way- directly sideways. He (<font color='blue'><b>Percy</b></font>) can't change directions very well once he (<font color='blue'><b>Percy</b></font>)'s charging. Do you
understand?''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``How do you know all this?''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``I've been worried about an attack for a long time. I should have expected this. I was selfish,
keeping you near me.''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>``Keeping me near you? But-``
Another bellow of rage, and the bull-man started tromping uphill.
He (<font color='blue'><b>Percy</b></font>)'d smelled us.
The pine tree was only a few more yards, but the hill was getting steeper and slicker, and Grover
wasn't getting any lighter.
The bull-man closed in. Another few seconds and he (<font color='blue'><b>Grover</b></font>)'d be on top of us.
My mother must've been exhausted, but she (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) shouldered Grover. <div class="bookquote">``Go, Percy! Separate! Remember
what I said.''
 (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div>I didn't want to split up, but I had the feeling she (<font color='blue'><b>mom</b></font>) was right-it was our only chance. I sprinted to
the left, turned, and saw the creature bearing down on me. His (<font color='blue'><b>Gabe</b></font>) black eyes glowed with hate. He (<font color='blue'><b>Gabe</b></font>)
reeked like rotten meat.
He (<font color='blue'><b>Gabe</b></font>) lowered his (<font color='blue'><b>Gabe</b></font>) head and charged, those razor-sharp horns aimed straight at my chest.

<p/>The fear in my stomach made me want to bolt, but that wouldn't work. I could never outrun this
thing. So I held my ground, and at the last moment, I jumped to the side.
The bull-man stormed past like a freight train, then bellowed with frustration and turned, but not
toward me this time, toward my mother, who was setting Grover down in the grass.
We'd reached the crest of the hill. Down the other side I could see a valley, just as my mother had
said, and the lights of a farmhouse glowing yellow through the rain. But that was half a mile away.
We'd never make it.
The bull-man grunted, pawing the ground. He (<font color='blue'><b>Grover</b></font>) kept eyeing my mother, who was now retreating
slowly downhill, back toward the road, trying to lead the monster away from Grover.
<div class="bookquote">``Run, Percy!''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) told me. <div class="bookquote">``I can't go any farther. Run!''
 (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div>But I just stood there, frozen in fear, as the monster charged her (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>). She (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) tried to sidestep, as she (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>)'d
told me to do, but the monster had learned his (<font color='blue'><b>Grover</b></font>) lesson. His (<font color='blue'><b>Grover</b></font>) hand shot out and grabbed her (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) by the neck
as she (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) tried to get away. He (<font color='blue'><b>Grover</b></font>) lifted her (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) as she (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) struggled, kicking and pummeling the air.
<div class="bookquote">``Mom!''
 (<font color='red'><b>She</b></font>)</div>She (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) caught my eyes, managed to choke out one last word: <div class="bookquote">``Go!''
 (<font color='red'><b>She</b></font>)</div>Then, with an angry roar, the monster closed his (<font color='blue'><b>Grover</b></font>) fists around my mother's neck, and she (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) dissolved
before my eyes, melting into light, a shimmering golden form, as if she (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) were a holographic projection.
A blinding flash, and she (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) was simply ... gone.
<div class="bookquote">``No!''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>Anger replaced my fear. Newfound strength burned in my limbs-the same rush of energy I'd gotten
when Mrs. Dodds grew talons.
The bull-man bore down on Grover, who lay helpless in the grass. The monster hunched over,
snuffling my best friend, as if he (<font color='blue'><b>friend</b></font>) were about to lift Grover up and make him (<font color='blue'><b>Grover</b></font>) dissolve too.
I couldn't allow that.
I stripped off my red rain jacket.
<div class="bookquote">``Hey!''  (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div>I screamed, waving the jacket, running to one side of the monster. <div class="bookquote">``Hey, stupid! Ground
beef!''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``Raaaarrrrr!''  (<font color='red'><b>The monster</b></font>)</div>The monster turned toward me, shaking his (<font color='blue'><b>Grover</b></font>) meaty fists.
I had an idea-a stupid idea, but better than no idea at all. I put my back to the big pine tree and
waved my red jacket in front of the bull-man, thinking I'd jump out of the way at the last moment.
But it didn't happen like that.
The bull-man charged too fast, his (<font color='blue'><b>Grover</b></font>) arms out to grab me whichever way I tried to dodge.
Time slowed down.
My legs tensed. I couldn't jump sideways, so I leaped straight up, kicking off from the creature's
head, using it as a springboard, turning in midair, and landing on his (<font color='blue'><b>Grover</b></font>) neck.
How did I do that? I didn't have time to figure it out. A millisecond later, the monster's head
slammed into the tree and the impact nearly knocked my teeth out.
The bull-man staggered around, trying to shake me. I locked my arms around his (<font color='blue'><b>Grover</b></font>) horns to keep
from being thrown. Thunder and lightning were still going strong. The rain was in my eyes. The smell
of rotten meat burned my nostrils.
The monster shook himself around and bucked like a rodeo bull. He (<font color='blue'><b>Grover</b></font>) should have just backed up
into the tree and smashed me flat, but I was starting to realize that this thing had only one gear:
forward.
Meanwhile, Grover started groaning in the grass. I wanted to yell at him (<font color='blue'><b>Grover</b></font>) to shut up, but the way I
was getting tossed around, if I opened my mouth I'd bite my own tongue off.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Food!''  (<font color='red'><b>Grover/Grover Underwood/GROVER</b></font>)</div>Grover moaned.
The bull-man wheeled toward him (<font color='blue'><b>Grover</b></font>), pawed the ground again, and got ready to charge. I thought
about how he (<font color='blue'><b>Grover</b></font>) had squeezed the life out of my mother, made her (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) disappear in a flash of light, and rage
filled me like high-octane fuel. I got both hands around one horn and I pulled backward with all my
might. The monster tensed, gave a surprised grunt, then-snap!
The bull-man screamed and flung me through the air. I landed flat on my back in the grass. My
head smacked against a rock. When I sat up, my vision was blurry, but I had a horn in my hands, a
ragged bone weapon the size of a knife.
The monster charged.
Without thinking, I rolled to one side and came up kneeling. As the monster barreled past, I drove
the broken horn straight into his (<font color='blue'><b>my</b></font>) side, right up under his (<font color='blue'><b>my</b></font>) furry rib cage.
The bull-man roared in agony. He (<font color='blue'><b>my</b></font>) flailed, clawing at his (<font color='blue'><b>my</b></font>) chest, then began to disintegrate-not like
my mother, in a flash of golden light, but like crumbling sand, blown away in chunks by the wind, the
same way Mrs. Dodds had burst apart.
The monster was gone.
The rain had stopped. The storm still rumbled, but only in the distance. I smelled like livestock
and my knees were shaking. My head felt like it was splitting open. I was weak and scared and
trembling with grief I'd just seen my mother vanish. I wanted to lie down and cry, but there was
Grover, needing my help, so I managed to haul him (<font color='blue'><b>Grover</b></font>) up and stagger down into the valley, toward the
lights of the farmhouse. I was crying, calling for my mother, but I held on to Grover-I wasn't going to
let him (<font color='blue'><b>Grover</b></font>) go.
The last thing I remember is collapsing on a wooden porch, looking up at a ceiling fan circling
above me, moths flying around a yellow light, and the stern faces of a familiar-looking bearded man
and a pretty girl, her (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) blond hair curled like a princess's. They both looked down at me, and the girl
said, <div class="bookquote">``He (<font color='blue'><b>Percy</b></font>)'s the one. He (<font color='blue'><b>Percy</b></font>) must be.''
 (<font color='red'><b>the girl</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``Silence, Annabeth,''  (<font color='red'><b>the man</b></font>)</div>the man said. <div class="bookquote">``He (<font color='blue'><b>Percy</b></font>)'s still conscious.

 (<font color='red'><b>Percy/Percy Jackson/Jackson</b></font>)</div><p/>Percy Jackson 1 - The Lightning Thief
5 I PLAY PINOCHLE
WITH A HORSE
I had weird dreams full of barnyard animals. Most of them wanted to kill me. The rest wanted
food.
I must've woken up several times, but what I heard and saw made no sense, so I just passed out
again. I remember lying in a soft bed, being spoon-fed something that tasted like buttered popcorn,
only it was pudding. The girl with curly blond hair hovered over me, smirking as she (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) scraped drips
off my chin with the spoon.
When she (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) saw my eyes open, she (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) asked, <div class="bookquote">``What will happen at the summer solstice?''
 (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>I managed to croak, <div class="bookquote">``What?''
 (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div>She (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) looked around, as if afraid someone would overhear. <div class="bookquote">``What's going on? What was stolen?
We've only got a few weeks!''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``I'm sorry,''  (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div>I mumbled, <div class="bookquote">``I don't...''
 (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div>Somebody knocked on the door, and the girl quickly filled my mouth with pudding.
The next time I woke up, the girl was gone.
A husky blond dude, like a surfer, stood in the corner of the bedroom keeping watch over me. He (<font color='blue'><b>dude</b></font>)
had blue eyes- at least a dozen of them-on his (<font color='blue'><b>dude</b></font>) cheeks, his (<font color='blue'><b>dude</b></font>) forehead, the backs of his (<font color='blue'><b>dude</b></font>) hands.
***
When I finally came around for good, there was nothing weird about my surroundings, except that
they were nicer than I was used to. I was sitting in a deck chair on a huge porch, gazing across a
meadow at green hills in the distance. The breeze smelled like strawberries. There was a blanket
over my legs, a pillow behind my neck. All that was great, but my mouth felt like a scorpion had been
using it for a nest. My tongue was dry and nasty and every one of my teeth hurt.
On the table next to me was a tall drink. It looked like iced apple juice, with a green straw and a
paper parasol stuck through a maraschino cherry.
My hand was so weak I almost dropped the glass once I got my fingers around it.
<div class="bookquote">``Careful,''  (<font color='red'><b>Grover/Grover Underwood/GROVER</b></font>)</div>a familiar voice said.
Grover was leaning against the porch railing, looking like he (<font color='blue'><b>Grover</b></font>) hadn't slept in a week. Under one
arm, he (<font color='blue'><b>Grover</b></font>) cradled a shoe box. He (<font color='blue'><b>Grover</b></font>) was wearing blue jeans, Converse hi-tops and a bright orange T-shirt
that said CAMP HALF-BLOOD. Just plain old Grover, Not the goat boy.
So maybe I'd had a nightmare. Maybe my mom was okay. We were still on vacation, and we'd
stopped here at this big house for some reason. And ...
<div class="bookquote">``You saved my life,''  (<font color='red'><b>Grover/Grover Underwood/GROVER</b></font>)</div>Grover said. <div class="bookquote">``I... well, the least I could do ... I went back to the hill. I
thought you might want this.''
 (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>Reverently, he (<font color='blue'><b>Grover</b></font>) placed the shoe box in my lap.
Inside was a black-and-white bull's horn, the base jagged from being broken off, the tip splattered
with dried blood. It hadn't been a nightmare.
<div class="bookquote">``The Minotaur,''  (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div>I said.
``Urn, Percy, it isn't a good idea-``
<div class="bookquote">``That's what they call him (<font color='blue'><b>Percy</b></font>) in the Greek myths, isn't it?''  (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div>I demanded. ``The Minotaur. Half man,

<p/>half bull.''
Grover shifted uncomfortably. ``You've been out for two days. How much do you remember?''
``My mom. Is she (<font color='blue'><b>mom</b></font>) really ...''
He (<font color='blue'><b>Grover</b></font>) looked down.
I stared across the meadow. There were groves of trees, a winding stream, acres of strawberries
spread out under the blue sky. The valley was surrounded by rolling hills, and the tallest one, directly
in front of us, was the one with the huge pine tree on top. Even that looked beautiful in the sunlight.
My mother was gone. The whole world should be black and cold. Nothing should look beautiful.
``I'm sorry,'' Grover sniffled. ``I'm a failure. I'm-I'm the worst satyr in the world.''
He (<font color='blue'><b>Grover</b></font>) moaned, stomping his (<font color='blue'><b>Grover</b></font>) foot so hard it came off. I mean, the Converse hi-top came off. The
inside was filled with Styrofoam, except for a hoof-shaped hole.
``Oh, Styx!'' he (<font color='blue'><b>Grover</b></font>) mumbled.
Thunder rolled across the clear sky.
As he (<font color='blue'><b>Grover</b></font>) struggled to get his (<font color='blue'><b>Grover</b></font>) hoof back in the fake foot, I thought, Well, that settles it.
Grover was a satyr. I was ready to bet that if I shaved his (<font color='blue'><b>Grover</b></font>) curly brown hair, I'd find tiny horns on
his (<font color='blue'><b>Grover</b></font>) head. But I was too miserable to care that satyrs existed, or even minotaurs. All that meant was my
mom really had been squeezed into nothingness, dissolved into yellow light.
I was alone. An orphan. I would have to live with ... Smelly Gabe? No. That would never
happen. I would live on the streets first. I would pretend I was seventeen and join the army. I'd do
something.
Grover was still sniffling. The poor kid-poor goat, satyr, whatever-looked as if he (<font color='blue'><b>Grover</b></font>) expected to be
hit.
I said, ``It wasn't your fault.''
``Yes, it was. I was supposed to protect you.''
``Did my mother ask you to protect me?''
``No. But that's my job. I'm a keeper. At least... I was.''
``But why ...'' I suddenly felt dizzy, my vision swimming.
``Don't strain yourself,'' Grover said. ``Here.'' He (<font color='blue'><b>Grover</b></font>) helped me hold my glass and put the straw to my
lips.
I recoiled at the taste, because I was expecting apple juice. It wasn't that at all. It was chocolatechip cookies. Liquid cookies. And not just any cookies-my mom's homemade blue chocolate-chip
cookies, buttery and hot, with the chips still melting. Drinking it, my whole body felt warm and good,
full of energy. My grief didn't go away, but I felt as if my mom had just brushed her (<font color='blue'><b>mom</b></font>) hand against my
cheek, given me a cookie the way she (<font color='blue'><b>mom</b></font>) used to when I was small, and told me everything was going to
be okay.
Before I knew it, I'd drained the glass. I stared into it, sure I'd just had a warm drink, but the ice
cubes hadn't even melted.
``Was it good?'' Grover asked.
I nodded.
``What did it taste like?'' He (<font color='blue'><b>Grover</b></font>) sounded so wistful, I felt guilty.
``Sorry,'' I said. ``I should've let you taste.''
His (<font color='blue'><b>Grover</b></font>) eyes got wide. ``No! That's not what I meant. I just... wondered.''
``Chocolate-chip cookies,'' I said. ``My mom's. Homemade.''
He (<font color='blue'><b>Grover</b></font>) sighed. ``And how do you feel?''
<div class="bookquote">``Like I could throw Nancy Bobofit a hundred yards.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``That's good,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Grover</b></font>) said. <div class="bookquote">``That's good. I don't think you could risk drinking any more of that stuff''
 (<font color='red'><b>He</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``What do you mean?''
 (<font color='red'><b>He</b></font>)</div>He (<font color='blue'><b>Grover</b></font>) took the empty glass from me gingerly, as if it were dynamite, and set it back on the table.
<div class="bookquote">``Come on. Chiron and Mr. D are waiting.''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>The porch wrapped all the way around the farmhouse.
My legs felt wobbly, trying to walk that far. Grover offered to carry the Minotaur horn, but I held
on to it. I'd paid for that souvenir the hard way. I wasn't going to let it go.
As we came around the opposite end of the house, I caught my breath.
We must've been on the north shore of Long Island, because on this side of the house, the valley
marched all the way up to the water, which glittered about a mile in the distance. Between here and
there, I simply couldn't process everything I was seeing. The landscape was dotted with buildings
that looked like ancient Greek architecture-an open-air pavilion, an amphitheater, a circular arenaexcept that they all looked brand new, their white marble columns sparkling in the sun. In a nearby
sandpit, a dozen high school-age kids and satyrs played volleyball. Canoes glided across a small
lake. Kids in bright orange T-shirts like Grover's were chasing each other around a cluster of cabins
nestled in the woods. Some shot targets at an archery range. Others rode horses down a wooded trail,
and, unless I was hallucinating, some of their horses had wings.
Down at the end of the porch, two men sat across from each other at a card table. The blondhaired girl who'd spoon-fed me popcorn-flavored pudding was leaning on the porch rail next to them.
The man facing me was small, but porky. He (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) had a red nose, big watery eyes, and curly hair so
black it was almost purple. He (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) looked like those paintings of baby angels- what do you call them,
hubbubs? No, cherubs. That's it. He (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) looked like a cherub who'd turned middle-aged in a trailer park.
He (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) wore a tiger-pattern Hawaiian shirt, and he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) would've fit right in at one of Gabe's poker parties,
except I got the feeling this guy could've out-gambled even my stepfather.
<div class="bookquote">``That's Mr. D,''  (<font color='red'><b>Grover/Grover Underwood/GROVER</b></font>)</div>Grover murmured to me. <div class="bookquote">``He (<font color='blue'><b>Mr.</b></font>)'s the camp director. Be polite. The girl, that's
Annabeth Chase. She (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>)'s just a camper, but she (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>)'s been here longer than just about anybody. And you
already know Chiron... .''
 (<font color='red'><b>He</b></font>)</div>He (<font color='blue'><b>Grover</b></font>) pointed at the guy whose back was to me.
First, I realized he (<font color='blue'><b>Grover</b></font>) was sitting in the wheelchair. Then I recognized the tweed jacket, the thinning
brown hair, the scraggly beard.
<div class="bookquote">``Mr. Brunner!''  (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div>I cried.
The Latin teacher turned and smiled at me. His (<font color='blue'><b>Grover</b></font>) eyes had that mischievous glint they sometimes got
in class when he (<font color='blue'><b>Grover</b></font>) pulled a pop quiz and made all the multiple choice answers B.
<div class="bookquote">``Ah, good, Percy,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Grover</b></font>) said. <div class="bookquote">``Now we have four for pinochle.''
 (<font color='red'><b>He</b></font>)</div>He (<font color='blue'><b>Grover</b></font>) offered me a chair to the right of Mr. D, who looked at me with bloodshot eyes and heaved a
great sigh. <div class="bookquote">``Oh, I suppose I must say it. Welcome to Camp Half-Blood. There. Now, don't expect me
to be glad to see you.''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``Uh, thanks.''  (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div>I scooted a little farther away from him (<font color='blue'><b>Mr.</b></font>) because, if there was one thing I had learned
from living with Gabe, it was how to tell when an adult has been hitting the happy juice. If Mr. D was
a stranger to alcohol, I was a satyr.
<div class="bookquote">``Annabeth?''  (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Brunner/Brunner</b></font>)</div>Mr. Brunner called to the blond girl.
She (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) came forward and Mr. Brunner introduced us. <div class="bookquote">``This young lady nursed you back to health,
Percy. Annabeth, my dear, why don't you go check on Percy's bunk? We'll be putting him (<font color='blue'><b>Percy</b></font>) in cabin
eleven for now.''
 (<font color='red'><b>Annabeth/ANNABETH</b></font>)</div>Annabeth said, <div class="bookquote">``Sure, Chiron.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Annabeth/ANNABETH</b></font>)</div><p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) was probably my age, maybe a couple of inches taller, and a whole lot more athletic looking.
With her (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) deep tan and her (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) curly blond hair, she (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) was almost exactly what I thought a stereotypical
California girl would look like, except her (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) eyes ruined the image. They were startling gray, like storm
clouds; pretty, but intimidating, too, as if she (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) were analyzing the best way to take me down in a fight.
She (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) glanced at the minotaur horn in my hands, then back at me. I imagined she (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) was going to say,
You killed a minotaur! or Wow, you're so awesome! or something like that.
Instead she (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) said, <div class="bookquote">``You drool when you sleep.''
 (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>Then she (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) sprinted off down the lawn, her (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) blond hair flying behind her (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>).
<div class="bookquote">``So,''  (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div>I said, anxious to change the subject. <div class="bookquote">``You, uh, work here, Mr. Brunner?''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``Not Mr. Brunner,''  (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Brunner/Brunner</b></font>)</div>the ex-Mr. Brunner said. <div class="bookquote">``I'm afraid that was a pseudonym. You may call me
Chiron.''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``Okay.''  (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div>Totally confused, I looked at the director. <div class="bookquote">``And Mr. D ... does that stand for something?''
 (<font color='red'><b>Mr.</b></font>)</div>Mr. D stopped shuffling the cards. He (<font color='blue'><b>Mr.</b></font>) looked at me like I'd just belched loudly. <div class="bookquote">``Young man,
names are powerful things. You don't just go around using them for no reason.''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``Oh. Right. Sorry.''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``I must say, Percy,''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>Chiron-Brunner broke in, <div class="bookquote">``I'm glad to see you alive. It's been a long time
since I've made a house call to a potential camper. I'd hate to think I've wasted my time.''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``House call?''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``My year at Yancy Academy, to instruct you. We have satyrs at most schools, of course, keeping a
lookout. But Grover alerted me as soon as he (<font color='blue'><b>Grover</b></font>) met you. He (<font color='blue'><b>Grover</b></font>) sensed you were something special, so I
decided to come upstate. I convinced the other Latin teacher to ... ah, take a leave of absence.''
 (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div>I tried to remember the beginning of the school year. It seemed like so long ago, but I did have a
fuzzy memory of there being another Latin teacher my first week at Yancy. Then, without explanation,
he (<font color='blue'><b>Mr.</b></font>) had disappeared and Mr. Brunner had taken the class.
<div class="bookquote">``You came to Yancy just to teach me?''  (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div>I asked.
Chiron nodded. <div class="bookquote">``Honestly, I wasn't sure about you at first. We contacted your mother, let her (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>)
know we were keeping an eye on you in case you were ready for Camp Half-Blood. But you still had
so much to learn. Nevertheless, you made it here alive, and that's always the first test.''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``Grover,''  (<font color='red'><b>Mr. D</b></font>)</div>Mr. D said impatiently, <div class="bookquote">``are you playing or not?''
 (<font color='red'><b>Mr. D</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``Yes, sir!''  (<font color='red'><b>Grover/Grover Underwood/GROVER</b></font>)</div>Grover trembled as he (<font color='blue'><b>Grover</b></font>) took the fourth chair, though I didn't know why he (<font color='blue'><b>Grover</b></font>) should be so
afraid of a pudgy little man in a tiger-print Hawaiian shirt.
<div class="bookquote">``You do know how to play pinochle?''  (<font color='red'><b>Mr.</b></font>)</div>Mr. D eyed me suspiciously.
<div class="bookquote">``I'm afraid not,''  (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div>I said.
<div class="bookquote">``I'm afraid not, sir,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Mr.</b></font>) said.
<div class="bookquote">``Sir,''  (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div>I repeated. I was liking the camp director less and less.
<div class="bookquote">``Well,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Mr.</b></font>) told me, <div class="bookquote">``it is, along with gladiator fighting and Pac-Man, one of the greatest games
ever invented by humans. I would expect all civilized young men to know the rules.''
 (<font color='red'><b>me</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``I'm sure the boy can learn,''  (<font color='red'><b>Chiron</b></font>)</div>Chiron said.
<div class="bookquote">``Please,''  (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div>I said, <div class="bookquote">``what is this place? What am I doing here? Mr. Brun-Chiron-why would you go
to Yancy Academy just to teach me?''
 (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div>Mr. D snorted. <div class="bookquote">``I asked the same question.''
 (<font color='red'><b>The camp director</b></font>)</div>The camp director dealt the cards. Grover flinched every time one landed in his (<font color='blue'><b>Grover</b></font>) pile.
Chiron smiled at me sympathetically, the way he (<font color='blue'><b>Grover</b></font>) used to in Latin class, as if to let me know that
no matter what my average was, I was his (<font color='blue'><b>Grover</b></font>) star student. He (<font color='blue'><b>Grover</b></font>) expected me to have the right answer.
<div class="bookquote">``Percy,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Grover</b></font>) said. ``Did your mother tell you nothing?'

<p/><div class="bookquote">``She (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) said ...''  (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div>I remembered her (<font color='blue'><b>me</b></font>) sad eyes, looking out over the sea. <div class="bookquote">``She (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) told me she (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) was afraid

couldn't leave. She (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) wanted to keep me close to her (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>).''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``Typical,''  (<font color='red'><b>Mr. D</b></font>)</div>Mr. D said. <div class="bookquote">``That's how they usually get killed. Young man, are you bidding or not?''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``What?''  (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div>I asked.
He (<font color='blue'><b>D</b></font>) explained, impatiently, how you bid in pinochle, and so I did.
<div class="bookquote">``I'm afraid there's too much to tell,''  (<font color='red'><b>Chiron</b></font>)</div>Chiron said. <div class="bookquote">``I'm afraid our usual orientation film won't be
sufficient.''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``Orientation film?''  (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div>I asked.
<div class="bookquote">``No,''  (<font color='red'><b>Chiron</b></font>)</div>Chiron decided. <div class="bookquote">``Well, Percy. You know your friend Grover is a satyr. You know'' (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>-he (<font color='blue'><b>D</b></font>)
pointed to the horn in the shoe box-<div class="bookquote">``that you have killed the Minotaur. No small feat, either, lad. What
you may not know is that great powers are at work in your life. Gods-the forces you call the Greek

 (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>I stared at the others around the table.
I waited for somebody to yell, Not! But all I got was Mr. D yelling, <div class="bookquote">``Oh, a royal marriage. Trick!
Trick!''  (<font color='red'><b>Mr.</b></font>)</div>He (<font color='blue'><b>Mr.</b></font>) cackled as he (<font color='blue'><b>Mr.</b></font>) tallied up his (<font color='blue'><b>Mr.</b></font>) points.
<div class="bookquote">``Mr. D,''  (<font color='red'><b>Grover/Grover Underwood/GROVER</b></font>)</div>Grover asked timidly, <div class="bookquote">``if you're not going to eat it, could I have your Diet Coke can?''

 (<font color='red'><b>Grover/Grover Underwood/GROVER</b></font>)</div>Grover bit a huge shard out of the empty aluminum can and chewed it mournfully.
<div class="bookquote">``Wait,''  (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div>I told Chiron. <div class="bookquote">``You're telling me there's such a thing as God.''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``Well, now,''  (<font color='red'><b>Chiron</b></font>)</div>Chiron said. <div class="bookquote">``God-capital G, God. That's a different matter altogether. We shan't

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``Zeus,''  (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div>I said. <div class="bookquote">``Hera. Apollo. You mean them.''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>And there it was again-distant thunder on a cloudless day.
<div class="bookquote">``Young man,''  (<font color='red'><b>Mr. D</b></font>)</div>said Mr. D, <div class="bookquote">``I would really be less casual about throwing those names around, if I
were you.''
 (<font color='red'><b>Mr. D</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``But they're stories,''  (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div>I said. <div class="bookquote">``They're-myths, to explain lightning and the seasons and stuff.
They're what people believed before there was science.''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``Science!''  (<font color='red'><b>Mr.</b></font>)</div>Mr. D scoffed. <div class="bookquote">``And tell me, Perseus Jackson'' (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div>-I flinched when he (<font color='blue'><b>Mr.</b></font>) said my real name,
which I never told anybody-<div class="bookquote">``what will people think of your 'science' two thousand years from now?''
 (<font color='red'><b>anybody</b></font>)</div>Mr. D continued. <div class="bookquote">``Hmm? They will call it primitive mumbo jumbo. That's what. Oh, I love mortalsthey have absolutely no sense of perspective. They think they've come so-o-o far. And have they,
Chiron? Look at this boy and tell me.''
 (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div>I wasn't liking Mr. D much, but there was something about the way he (<font color='blue'><b>Mr.</b></font>) called me mortal, as if...
he (<font color='blue'><b>Mr.</b></font>) wasn't. It was enough to put a lump in my throat, to suggest why Grover was dutifully minding his (<font color='blue'><b>Grover</b></font>)
cards, chewing his (<font color='blue'><b>Grover</b></font>) soda can, and keeping his (<font color='blue'><b>Grover</b></font>) mouth shut.
<div class="bookquote">``Percy,''  (<font color='red'><b>Chiron</b></font>)</div>Chiron said, <div class="bookquote">``you may choose to believe or not, but the fact is that immortal means
immortal. Can you imagine that for a moment, never dying? Never fading? Existing, just as you are,
for all time?''
 (<font color='red'><b>Chiron</b></font>)</div>I was about to answer, off the top of my head, that it sounded like a pretty good deal, but the tone

<p/>of Chiron's voice made me hesitate.
<div class="bookquote">``You mean, whether people believed in you or not,''  (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div>I said.
<div class="bookquote">``Exactly,''  (<font color='red'><b>Chiron</b></font>)</div>Chiron agreed. <div class="bookquote">``If you were a god, how would you like being called a myth, an old
story to explain lightning? What if I told you, Perseus Jackson, that someday people would call you a
myth, just created to explain how little boys can get over losing their mothers?''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>My heart pounded. He (<font color='blue'><b>Grover</b></font>) was trying to make me angry for some reason, but I wasn't going to let him (<font color='blue'><b>Grover</b></font>).
I said, <div class="bookquote">``I wouldn't like it. But I don't believe in gods.''
 (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``Oh, you'd better,''  (<font color='red'><b>Mr.</b></font>)</div>Mr. D murmured. <div class="bookquote">``Before one of them incinerates you.''
 (<font color='red'><b>Grover/Grover Underwood/GROVER</b></font>)</div>Grover said, <div class="bookquote">``P-please, sir. He (<font color='blue'><b>Jackson</b></font>)'s just lost his (<font color='blue'><b>Jackson</b></font>) mother. He (<font color='blue'><b>Jackson</b></font>)'s in shock.''
 (<font color='red'><b>Grover/Grover Underwood/GROVER</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``A lucky thing, too,''  (<font color='red'><b>Mr.</b></font>)</div>Mr. D grumbled, playing a card. ``Bad enough I'm confined to this miserable
job, working with boys who don't even believe.'''
He (<font color='blue'><b>Jackson</b></font>) waved his (<font color='blue'><b>Jackson</b></font>) hand and a goblet appeared on the table, as if the sunlight had bent, momentarily,
and woven the air into glass. The goblet filled itself with red wine.
My jaw dropped, but Chiron hardly looked up.
``Mr. D,'' he (<font color='blue'><b>Mr.</b></font>) warned, ``your restrictions.''
Mr. D looked at the wine and feigned surprise.
``Dear me.'' He (<font color='blue'><b>Mr.</b></font>) looked at the sky and yelled, ``Old habits! Sorry!''
More thunder.
Mr. D waved his (<font color='blue'><b>D</b></font>) hand again, and the wineglass changed into a fresh can of Diet Coke. He (<font color='blue'><b>D</b></font>) sighed
unhappily, popped the top of the soda, and went back to his (<font color='blue'><b>D</b></font>) card game.
Chiron winked at me. ``Mr. D offended his (<font color='blue'><b>Mr.</b></font>) father a while back, took a fancy to a wood nymph who
had been declared off-limits.''
``A wood nymph,'' I repeated, still staring at the Diet Coke can like it was from outer space.
``Yes,'' Mr. D confessed. ``Father loves to punish me. The first time, Prohibition. Ghastly!
Absolutely horrid ten years! The second time-well, she (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) really was pretty, and I couldn't stay awaythe second time, he (<font color='blue'><b>Father</b></font>) sent me here. Half-Blood Hill. Summer camp for brats like you. `Be a better
influence,' he (<font color='blue'><b>Hill</b></font>) told me. `Work with youths rather than tearing them down.' Ha.' Absolutely unfair.''
Mr. D sounded about six years old, like a pouting little kid.
``And ...'' I stammered, ``your father is ...''
``Di immortales, Chiron,'' Mr. D said. ``I thought you taught this boy the basics. My father is Zeus,
of course.''
I ran through D names from Greek mythology. Wine. The skin of a tiger. The satyrs that all seemed
to work here. The way Grover cringed, as if Mr. D were his (<font color='blue'><b>Mr.</b></font>) master.
``You're Dionysus,'' I said. ``The god of wine.''
Mr. D rolled his (<font color='blue'><b>Mr.</b></font>) eyes. ``What do they say, these days, Grover? Do the children say, `Well, duh!'?''
``Y-yes, Mr. D.''
``Then, well, duh! Percy Jackson. Did you think I was Aphrodite, perhaps?''
``You're a god.''
``Yes, child.''
<div class="bookquote">``A god. You.''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>He (<font color='blue'><b>Mr.</b></font>) turned to look at me straight on, and I saw a kind of purplish fire in his (<font color='blue'><b>Mr.</b></font>) eyes, a hint that this
whiny, plump little man was only showing me the tiniest bit of his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) true nature. I saw visions of grape
vines choking unbelievers to death, drunken warriors insane with battle lust, sailors screaming as
their hands turned to flippers, their faces elongating into dolphin snouts. I knew that if I pushed him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>),
Mr. D would show me worse things. He (<font color='blue'><b>Mr.</b></font>) would plant a disease in my brain that would leave me

<p/>wearing a strait-jacket in a rubber room for the rest of my life.
<div class="bookquote">``Would you like to test me, child?''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Mr.</b></font>) said quietly.
<div class="bookquote">``No. No, sir.''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>The fire died a little. He (<font color='blue'><b>Mr.</b></font>) turned back to his (<font color='blue'><b>Mr.</b></font>) card game. <div class="bookquote">``I believe I win.''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``Not quite, Mr. D,''  (<font color='red'><b>Chiron</b></font>)</div>Chiron said. He (<font color='blue'><b>Mr.</b></font>) set down a straight, tallied the points, and said, <div class="bookquote">``The game
goes to me.''
 (<font color='red'><b>He</b></font>)</div>I thought Mr. D was going to vaporize Chiron right out of his (<font color='blue'><b>Mr.</b></font>) wheelchair, but he (<font color='blue'><b>Mr.</b></font>) just sighed
through his (<font color='blue'><b>Mr.</b></font>) nose, as if he (<font color='blue'><b>Mr.</b></font>) were used to being beaten by the Latin teacher. He (<font color='blue'><b>Mr.</b></font>) got up, and Grover rose,
too.
<div class="bookquote">``I'm tired,''  (<font color='red'><b>Mr. D</b></font>)</div>Mr. D said. <div class="bookquote">``I believe I'll take a nap before the sing-along tonight. But first, Grover,
we need to talk, again, about your less-than-perfect performance on this assignment.''
 (<font color='red'><b>Grover/Grover Underwood/GROVER</b></font>)</div>Grover's face beaded with sweat. <div class="bookquote">``Y-yes, sir.''
 (<font color='red'><b>Mr.</b></font>)</div>Mr. D turned to me. <div class="bookquote">``Cabin eleven, Percy Jackson. And mind your manners.''
 (<font color='red'><b>He</b></font>)</div>He (<font color='blue'><b>Mr.</b></font>) swept into the farmhouse, Grover following miserably.
<div class="bookquote">``Will Grover be okay?''  (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div>I asked Chiron.
Chiron nodded, though he (<font color='blue'><b>Grover</b></font>) looked a bit troubled. <div class="bookquote">``Old Dionysus isn't really mad. He (<font color='blue'><b>Grover</b></font>) just hates his (<font color='blue'><b>Grover</b></font>)
job. He (<font color='blue'><b>Grover</b></font>)'s been ... ah, grounded, I guess you would say, and he (<font color='blue'><b>Grover</b></font>) can't stand waiting another century
before he (<font color='blue'><b>Grover</b></font>)'s allowed to go back to Olympus.''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``Mount Olympus,''  (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div>I said. <div class="bookquote">``You're telling me there really is a palace there?''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``Well now, there's Mount Olympus in Greece. And then there's the home of the gods, the
convergence point of their powers, which did indeed used to be on Mount Olympus. It's still called
Mount Olympus, out of respect to the old ways, but the palace moves, Percy, just as the gods do.''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``You mean the Greek gods are here? Like ... in America?''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``Well, certainly. The gods move with the heart of the West.''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``The what?''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``Come now, Percy. What you call `Western civilization.' Do you think it's just an abstract
concept? No, it's a living force. A collective consciousness that has burned bright for thousands of
years. The gods are part of it. You might even say they are the source of it, or at least, they are tied so
tightly to it that they couldn't possibly fade, not unless all of Western civilization were obliterated.
The fire started in Greece. Then, as you well know-or as I hope you know, since you passed my
course-the heart of the fire moved to Rome, and so did the gods. Oh, different names, perhaps-Jupiter
for Zeus, Venus for Aphrodite, and so on-but the same forces, the same gods.''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``And then they died.''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``Died? No. Did the West die? The gods simply moved, to Germany, to France, to Spain, for a
while. Wherever the flame was brightest, the gods were there. They spent several centuries in
England. All you need to do is look at the architecture. People do not forget the gods. Every place
they've ruled, for the last three thousand years, you can see them in paintings, in statues, on the most
important buildings. And yes, Percy, of course they are now in your United States. Look at your
symbol, the eagle of Zeus. Look at the statue of Prometheus in Rockefeller Center, the Greek facades
of your government buildings in Washington. I defy you to find any American city where the
Olympians are not prominently displayed in multiple places. Like it or not-and believe me, plenty of
people weren't very fond of Rome, either-America is now the heart of the flame. It is the great power
of the West. And so Olympus is here. And we are here.''
 (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div>It was all too much, especially the fact that I seemed to be included in Chiron's we, as if I were
part of some club.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Who are you, Chiron? Who ... who am I?''
 (<font color='red'><b>Chiron</b></font>)</div>Chiron smiled. He (<font color='blue'><b>Grover</b></font>) shifted his (<font color='blue'><b>Grover</b></font>) weight as if he (<font color='blue'><b>Grover</b></font>) were going to get up out of his (<font color='blue'><b>Grover</b></font>) wheelchair, but I
knew that was impossible. He (<font color='blue'><b>Grover</b></font>) was paralyzed from the waist down.
<div class="bookquote">``Who are you?''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Grover</b></font>) mused. <div class="bookquote">``Well, that's the question we all want answered, isn't it? But for now,
we should get you a bunk in cabin eleven. There will be new friends to meet. And plenty of time for
lessons tomorrow. Besides, there will be s'mores at the campfire tonight, and I simply adore
chocolate.''
 (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>And then he (<font color='blue'><b>Grover</b></font>) did rise from his (<font color='blue'><b>Grover</b></font>) wheelchair. But there was something odd about the way he (<font color='blue'><b>Grover</b></font>) did it.
His (<font color='blue'><b>Grover</b></font>) blanket fell away from his (<font color='blue'><b>Grover</b></font>) legs, but the legs didn't move. His (<font color='blue'><b>Grover</b></font>) waist kept getting longer, rising
above his (<font color='blue'><b>Grover</b></font>) belt. At first, I thought he (<font color='blue'><b>Grover</b></font>) was wearing very long, white velvet underwear, but as he (<font color='blue'><b>Grover</b></font>) kept
rising out of the chair, taller than any man, I realized that the velvet underwear wasn't underwear; it
was the front of an animal, muscle and sinew under coarse white fur. And the wheelchair wasn't a
chair. It was some kind of container, an enormous box on wheels, and it must've been magic, because
there's no way it could've held all of him (<font color='blue'><b>Grover</b></font>). A leg came out, long and knobby-kneed, with a huge
polished hoof. Then another front leg, then hindquarters, and then the box was empty, nothing but a
metal shell with a couple of fake human legs attached.
I stared at the horse who had just sprung from the wheelchair: a huge white stallion. But where its
neck should be was the upper body of my Latin teacher, smoothly grafted to the horse's trunk.
<div class="bookquote">``What a relief,''  (<font color='red'><b>the centaur</b></font>)</div>the centaur said. <div class="bookquote">``I'd been cooped up in there so long, my fetlocks had fallen
asleep. Now, come, Percy Jackson. Let's meet the other campers.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Percy/Percy Jackson/Jackson</b></font>)</div><p/>Percy Jackson 1 - The Lightning Thief
6 I BECOME SUPREME LORD
OF THE BATHROOM
Once I got over the fact that my Latin teacher was a horse, we had a nice tour, though I was
careful not to walk behind him (<font color='blue'><b>Jackson</b></font>). I'd done pooper-scooper patrol in the Macy's Thanksgiving Day
Parade a few times, and, I'm sorry, I did not trust Chiron's back end the way I trusted his (<font color='blue'><b>Macy</b></font>) front.
We passed the volleyball pit. Several of the campers nudged each other. One pointed to the
minotaur horn I was carrying. Another said, <div class="bookquote">``That's him (<font color='blue'><b>Jackson</b></font>).''
 (<font color='red'><b>the campers</b></font>)</div>Most of the campers were older than me. Their satyr friends were bigger than Grover, all of them
trotting around in orange CAMP HALF-BLOOD T-shirts, with nothing else to cover their bare shaggy
hindquarters. I wasn't normally shy, but the way they stared at me made me uncomfortable. I felt like
they were expecting me to do a flip or something.
I looked back at the farmhouse. It was a lot bigger than I'd realized-four stories tall, sky blue with
white trim, like an upscale seaside resort. I was checking out the brass eagle weather vane on top
when something caught my eye, a shadow in the uppermost window of the attic gable. Something had
moved the curtain, just for a second, and I got the distinct impression I was being watched.
<div class="bookquote">``What's up there?''  (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div>I asked Chiron.
He (<font color='blue'><b>I</b></font>) looked where I was pointing, and his (<font color='blue'><b>I</b></font>) smile faded. <div class="bookquote">``Just the attic.''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``Somebody lives there?''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``No,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>I</b></font>) said with finality. <div class="bookquote">``Not a single living thing.''
 (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div>I got the feeling he (<font color='blue'><b>I</b></font>) was being truthful. But I was also sure something had moved that curtain.
<div class="bookquote">``Come along, Percy,''  (<font color='red'><b>Chiron</b></font>)</div>Chiron said, his (<font color='blue'><b>I</b></font>) lighthearted tone now a little forced. <div class="bookquote">``Lots to see.''
 (<font color='red'><b>campers</b></font>)</div>We walked through the strawberry fields, where campers were picking bushels of berries while a
satyr played a tune on a reed pipe.
Chiron told me the camp grew a nice crop for export to New York restaurants and Mount
Olympus. <div class="bookquote">``It pays our expenses,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>I</b></font>) explained. <div class="bookquote">``And the strawberries take almost no effort.''
 (<font color='red'><b>He</b></font>)</div>He (<font color='blue'><b>I</b></font>) said Mr. D had this effect on fruit-bearing plants: they just went crazy when he (<font color='blue'><b>I</b></font>) was around. It
worked best with wine grapes, but Mr. D was restricted from growing those, so they grew
strawberries instead.
I watched the satyr playing his (<font color='blue'><b>Mr.</b></font>) pipe. His (<font color='blue'><b>Mr.</b></font>) music was causing lines of bugs to leave the strawberry
patch in every direction, like refugees fleeing a fire. I wondered if Grover could work that kind of
magic with music. I wondered if he (<font color='blue'><b>Grover</b></font>) was still inside the farmhouse, getting chewed out by Mr. D.
<div class="bookquote">``Grover won't get in too much trouble, will he (<font color='blue'><b>Grover</b></font>)?''  (<font color='red'><b>Mr.</b></font>)</div>I asked Chiron. <div class="bookquote">``I mean ... he (<font color='blue'><b>Grover</b></font>) was a good
protector. Really.''
 (<font color='red'><b>Chiron</b></font>)</div>Chiron sighed. He (<font color='blue'><b>Mr.</b></font>) shed his (<font color='blue'><b>Mr.</b></font>) tweed jacket and draped it over his (<font color='blue'><b>Mr.</b></font>) horses back like a saddle.
<div class="bookquote">``Grover has big dreams, Percy. Perhaps bigger than are reasonable. To reach his (<font color='blue'><b>Grover</b></font>) goal, he (<font color='blue'><b>Grover</b></font>) must first
demonstrate great courage by succeeding as a keeper, finding a new camper and bringing him (<font color='blue'><b>camper</b></font>) safely
to Half-Blood Hill.''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``But he (<font color='blue'><b>Hill</b></font>) did that!''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``I might agree with you,''  (<font color='red'><b>Chiron</b></font>)</div>Chiron said. ``But it is not my place to judge. Dionysus and the Council
of Cloven Elders must decide. I'm afraid they might not see this assignment as a success. After all,

<p/>Grover lost you in New York. Then there's the unfortunate ... ah ... fate of your mother. And the fact
that Grover was unconscious when you dragged him (<font color='blue'><b>Grover</b></font>) over the property line. The council might
question whether this shows any courage on Grover's part.''
I wanted to protest. None of what happened was Grover's fault. I also felt really, really guilty. If I
hadn't given Grover the slip at the bus station, he (<font color='blue'><b>Grover</b></font>) might not have gotten in trouble.
``He (<font color='blue'><b>Grover</b></font>)'ll get a second chance, won't he (<font color='blue'><b>Grover</b></font>)?''
Chiron winced. ``I'm afraid that was Grover's second chance, Percy. The council was not anxious
to give him (<font color='blue'><b>Grover</b></font>) another, either, after what happened the first time, five years ago. Olympus knows, I
advised him (<font color='blue'><b>Grover</b></font>) to wait longer before trying again. He (<font color='blue'><b>Grover</b></font>)'s still so small for his (<font color='blue'><b>Grover</b></font>) age... .''
``How old is he (<font color='blue'><b>Grover</b></font>)?''
``Oh, twenty-eight.''
``What! And he (<font color='blue'><b>Grover</b></font>)'s in sixth grade?''
``Satyrs mature half as fast as humans, Percy. Grover has been the equivalent of a middle school
student for the past six years.''
``That's horrible.''
``Quite,'' Chiron agreed. ``At any rate, Grover is a late bloomer, even by satyr standards, and not
yet very accomplished at woodland magic. Alas, he (<font color='blue'><b>Grover</b></font>) was anxious to pursue his (<font color='blue'><b>Grover</b></font>) dream. Perhaps now he (<font color='blue'><b>Grover</b></font>)
will find some other career... .''
``That's not fair,'' I said. ``What happened the first time? Was it really so bad?''
Chiron looked away quickly. ``Let's move along, shall we?''
But I wasn't quite ready to let the subject drop. Something had occurred to me when Chiron talked
about my mother's fate, as if he (<font color='blue'><b>Grover</b></font>) were intentionally avoiding the word death. The beginnings of an
idea-a tiny, hopeful fire-started forming in my mind.
``Chiron,'' I said. ``If the gods and Olympus and all that are real ...''
``Yes, child?''
``Does that mean the Underworld is real, too?''
Chiron's expression darkened.
``Yes, child.'' He (<font color='blue'><b>Grover</b></font>) paused, as if choosing his (<font color='blue'><b>Grover</b></font>) words carefully. ``There is a place where spirits go
after death. But for now ... until we know more ... I would urge you to put that out of your mind.''
``What do you mean, `until we know more'?''
``Come, Percy. Let's see the woods.''
As we got closer, I realized how huge the forest was. It took up at least a quarter of the valley,
with trees so tall and thick, you could imagine nobody had been in there since the Native Americans.
Chiron said, ``The woods are stocked, if you care to try your luck, but go armed.''
``Stocked with what?'' I asked. ``Armed with what?''
``You'll see. Capture the flag is Friday night. Do you have your own sword and shield?''
``My own-?''
``No,'' Chiron said. ``I don't suppose you do. I think a size five will do. I'll visit the armory later.''
I wanted to ask what kind of summer camp had an armory, but there was too much else to think
about, so the tour continued. We saw the archery range, the canoeing lake, the stables -LRB-which Chiron
didn't seem to like very much-RRB-, the javelin range, the sing-along amphitheater, and the arena where
Chiron said they held sword and spear fights.
``Sword and spear fights?'' I asked.
``Cabin challenges and all that,'' he (<font color='blue'><b>Americans</b></font>) explained. <div class="bookquote">``Not lethal. Usually. Oh, yes, and there's the mess
hall.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Chiron</b></font>)</div><p/>Chiron pointed to an outdoor pavilion framed in white Grecian columns on a hill overlooking the
sea. There were a dozen stone picnic tables. No roof. No walls.
<div class="bookquote">``What do you do when it rains?''  (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div>I asked.
Chiron looked at me as if I'd gone a little weird. <div class="bookquote">``We still have to eat, don't we?''  (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div>I decided to
drop the subject.
Finally, he (<font color='blue'><b>Americans</b></font>) showed me the cabins. There were twelve of them, nestled in the woods by the lake.
They were arranged in a U, with two at the base and five in a row on either side. And they were
without doubt the most bizarre collection of buildings I'd ever seen.
Except for the fact that each had a large brass number above the door -LRB-odds on the left side, evens
on the right-RRB-, they looked absolutely nothing alike. Number nine had smokestacks, like a tiny factory.
Number four had tomato vines on the walls and a roof made out of real grass. Seven seemed to be
made of solid gold, which gleamed so much in the sunlight it was almost impossible to look at. They
all faced a commons area about the size of a soccer field, dotted with Greek statues, fountains, flower
beds, and a couple of basketball hoops -LRB-which were more my speed-RRB-.
In the center of the field was a huge stone-lined firepit. Even though it was a warm afternoon, the
hearth smoldered. A girl about nine years old was tending the flames, poking the coals with a stick.
The pair of cabins at the head of the field, numbers one and two, looked like his-and-hers
mausoleums, big white marble boxes with heavy columns in front. Cabin one was the biggest and
bulkiest of the twelve. Its polished bronze doors shimmered like a hologram, so that from different
angles lightning bolts seemed to streak across them. Cabin two was more graceful somehow, with
slimmer columns garlanded with pomegranates and flowers. The walls were carved with images of
peacocks.
<div class="bookquote">``Zeus and Hera?''  (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div>I guessed.
<div class="bookquote">``Correct,''  (<font color='red'><b>Chiron</b></font>)</div>Chiron said.
<div class="bookquote">``Their cabins look empty.''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``Several of the cabins are. That's true. No one ever stays in one or two.''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>Okay. So each cabin had a different god, like a mascot. Twelve cabins for the twelve Olympians.
But why would some be empty?
I stopped in front of the first cabin on the left, cabin three.
It wasn't high and mighty like cabin one, but long and low and solid. The outer walls were of
rough gray stone studded with pieces of seashell and coral, as if the slabs had been hewn straight
from the bottom of the ocean floor. I peeked inside the open doorway and Chiron said, <div class="bookquote">``Oh, I
wouldn't do that!''
 (<font color='red'><b>Chiron</b></font>)</div>Before he (<font color='blue'><b>god</b></font>) could pull me back, I caught the salty scent of the interior, like the wind on the shore at
Montauk. The interior walls glowed like abalone. There were six empty bunk beds with silk sheets
turned down. But there was no sign anyone had ever slept there. The place felt so sad and lonely, I
was glad when Chiron put his (<font color='blue'><b>god</b></font>) hand on my shoulder and said, <div class="bookquote">``Come along, Percy.''
 (<font color='red'><b>Chiron</b></font>)</div>Most of the other cabins were crowded with campers.
Number five was bright red-a real nasty paint job, as if the color had been splashed on with
buckets and fists. The roof was lined with barbed wire. A stuffed wild boar's head hung over the
doorway, and its eyes seemed to follow me. Inside I could see a bunch of mean-looking kids, both
girls and boys, arm wrestling and arguing with each other while rock music blared. The loudest was a
girl maybe thirteen or fourteen. She (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) wore a size XXXL CAMP HALF-BLOOD T-shirt under a
camouflage jacket. She (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) zeroed in on me and gave me an evil sneer. She (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) reminded me of Nancy
Bobofit, though the camper girl was much bigger and tougher looking, and her (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) hair was long and

<p/>stringy, and brown instead of red.
I kept walking, trying to stay clear of Chiron's hooves. <div class="bookquote">``We haven't seen any other centaurs,''  (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div>I
observed.
<div class="bookquote">``No,''  (<font color='red'><b>Chiron</b></font>)</div>said Chiron sadly. <div class="bookquote">``My kinsmen are a wild and barbaric folk, I'm afraid. You might
encounter them in the wilderness, or at major sporting events. But you won't see any here.''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``You said your name was Chiron. Are you really ...''
 (<font color='red'><b>He</b></font>)</div>He (<font color='blue'><b>camper</b></font>) smiled down at me. <div class="bookquote">``The Chiron from the stories? Trainer of Hercules and all that? Yes,
Percy, I am.''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``But, shouldn't you be dead?''
 (<font color='red'><b>Chiron</b></font>)</div>Chiron paused, as if the question intrigued him (<font color='blue'><b>camper</b></font>). <div class="bookquote">``I honestly don't know about should be. The truth
is, I can't be dead. You see, eons ago the gods granted my wish. I could continue the work I loved. I
could be a teacher of heroes as long as humanity needed me. I gained much from that wish ... and I
gave up much. But I'm still here, so I can only assume I'm still needed.''
 (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div>I thought about being a teacher for three thousand years. It wouldn't have made my Top Ten
Things to Wish For list.
<div class="bookquote">``Doesn't it ever get boring?''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``No, no,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>camper</b></font>) said. <div class="bookquote">``Horribly depressing, at times, but never boring.''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``Why depressing?''
 (<font color='red'><b>Chiron</b></font>)</div>Chiron seemed to turn hard of hearing again.
<div class="bookquote">``Oh, look,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>camper</b></font>) said. <div class="bookquote">``Annabeth is waiting for us.''
 (<font color='red'><b>The girl</b></font>)</div>***
The blond girl I'd met at the Big House was reading a book in front of the last cabin on the left,
number eleven.
When we reached her (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>), she (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) looked me over critically, like she (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) was still thinking about how much I
drooled.
I tried to see what she (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) was reading, but I couldn't make out the title. I thought my dyslexia was
acting up. Then I realized the title wasn't even English. The letters looked Greek to me. I mean,
literally Greek. There were pictures of temples and statues and different kinds of columns, like those
in an architecture book.
<div class="bookquote">``Annabeth,''  (<font color='red'><b>Chiron</b></font>)</div>Chiron said, <div class="bookquote">``I have masters' archery class at noon. Would you take Percy from
here?''
 (<font color='red'><b>Chiron</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``Yes, sir.''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``Cabin eleven,''  (<font color='red'><b>Chiron</b></font>)</div>Chiron told me, gesturing toward the doorway. <div class="bookquote">``Make yourself at home.''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>Out of all the cabins, eleven looked the most like a regular old summer camp cabin, with the
emphasis on old. The threshold was worn down, the brown paint peeling. Over the doorway was one
of those doctor's symbols, a winged pole with two snakes wrapped around it. What did they call it...
? A caduceus.
Inside, it was packed with people, both boys and girls, way more than the number of bunk beds.
Sleeping bags were spread all over on the floor. It looked like a gym where the Red Cross had set up
an evacuation center.
Chiron didn't go in. The door was too low for him (<font color='blue'><b>doctor</b></font>). But when the campers saw him (<font color='blue'><b>doctor</b></font>) they all stood
and bowed respectfully.
<div class="bookquote">``Well, then,''  (<font color='red'><b>Chiron</b></font>)</div>Chiron said. <div class="bookquote">``Good luck, Percy. I'll see you at dinner.''
 (<font color='red'><b>He</b></font>)</div>He (<font color='blue'><b>doctor</b></font>) galloped away toward the archery range.
I stood in the doorway, looking at the kids. They weren't bowing anymore. They were staring at

<p/>me, sizing me up. I knew this routine. I'd gone through it at enough schools.
<div class="bookquote">``Well?''  (<font color='red'><b>Annabeth/ANNABETH</b></font>)</div>Annabeth prompted. <div class="bookquote">``Go on.''
 (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div>So naturally I tripped coming in the door and made a total fool of myself. There were some
snickers from the campers, but none of them said anything.
Annabeth announced, ``Percy Jackson, meet cabin eleven.
``Regular or undetermined?'' somebody asked.
I didn't know what to say, but Annabeth said, ``Undetermined.''
Everybody groaned.
A guy who was a little older than the rest came forward. ``Now, now, campers. That's what we're
here for. Welcome, Percy. You can have that spot on the floor, right over there.''
The guy was about nineteen, and he (<font color='blue'><b>guy</b></font>) looked pretty cool. He (<font color='blue'><b>guy</b></font>) was tall and muscular, with shortcropped sandy hair and a friendly smile. He (<font color='blue'><b>guy</b></font>) wore an orange tank top, cutoffs, sandals, and a leather
necklace with five different-colored clay beads. The only thing unsettling about his (<font color='blue'><b>guy</b></font>) appearance was a
thick white scar that ran from just beneath his (<font color='blue'><b>guy</b></font>) right eye to his (<font color='blue'><b>guy</b></font>) jaw, like an old knife slash.
``This is Luke,'' Annabeth said, and her (<font color='blue'><b>guy</b></font>) voice sounded different somehow. I glanced over and
could've sworn she (<font color='blue'><b>guy</b></font>) was blushing. She (<font color='blue'><b>guy</b></font>) saw me looking, and her (<font color='blue'><b>guy</b></font>) expression hardened again. ``He (<font color='blue'><b>Luke</b></font>)'s
your counselor for now.''
``For now?'' I asked.
``You're undetermined,'' Luke explained patiently. ``They don't know what cabin to put you in, so
you're here. Cabin eleven takes all newcomers, all visitors. Naturally, we would. Hermes, our
patron, is the god of travelers.''
I looked at the tiny section of floor they'd given me. I had nothing to put there to mark it as my
own, no luggage, no clothes, no sleeping bag. Just the Minotaur's horn. I thought about setting that
down, but then I remembered that Hermes was also the god of thieves.
I looked around at the campers' faces, some sullen and suspicious, some grinning stupidly, some
eyeing me as if they were waiting for a chance to pick my pockets.
``How long will I be here?'' I asked.
``Good question,'' Luke said. ``Until you're determined.''
``How long will that take?''
The campers all laughed.
``Come on,'' Annabeth told me. ``I'll show you the volleyball court.''
``I've already seen it.''
``Come on.'' She (<font color='blue'><b>Annabeth</b></font>) grabbed my wrist and dragged me outside. I could hear the kids of cabin eleven
laughing behind me.
When we were a few feet away, Annabeth said, ``Jackson, you have to do better than that.''
``What?''
She (<font color='blue'><b>Annabeth</b></font>) rolled her (<font color='blue'><b>Annabeth</b></font>) eyes and mumbled under her (<font color='blue'><b>Annabeth</b></font>) breath, ``I can't believe I thought you were the one.''
``What's your problem?'' I was getting angry now. ``All I know is, I kill some bull guy-``
``Don't talk like that!'' Annabeth told me. ``You know how many kids at this camp wish they'd had
your chance?''
``To get killed?''
``To fight the Minotaur! What do you think we train for?''
I shook my head. ``Look, if the thing I fought really was the Minotaur, the same one in the stories
...''
<div class="bookquote">``Yes.''

 (<font color='red'><b>the Minotaur</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Then there's only one.''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``Yes.''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``And he (<font color='blue'><b>guy</b></font>) died, like, a gajillion years ago, right? Theseus killed him (<font color='blue'><b>Theseus</b></font>) in the labyrinth. So ...''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``Monsters don't die, Percy. They can be killed. But they don't die.''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``Oh, thanks. That clears it up.''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``They don't have souls, like you and me. You can dispel them for a while, maybe even for a
whole lifetime if you're lucky. But they are primal forces. Chiron calls them archetypes. Eventually,
they re-form.''
 (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div>I thought about Mrs. Dodds. ``You mean if I killed one, accidentally, with a sword-``
<div class="bookquote">``The Fur ... I mean, your math teacher. That's right. She (<font color='blue'><b>They</b></font>)'s still out there. You just made her (<font color='blue'><b>They</b></font>) very,
very mad.''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``How did you know about Mrs. Dodds?''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``You talk in your sleep.''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``You almost called her (<font color='blue'><b>Dodds</b></font>) something. A Fury? They're Hades' torturers, right?''
 (<font color='red'><b>Annabeth/ANNABETH</b></font>)</div>Annabeth glanced nervously at the ground, as if she (<font color='blue'><b>Dodds</b></font>) expected it to open up and swallow her (<font color='blue'><b>Dodds</b></font>). <div class="bookquote">``You
shouldn't call them by name, even here. We call them the Kindly Ones, if we have to speak of them at
all.''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``Look, is there anything we can say without it thundering?''  (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div>I sounded whiny, even to myself, but
right then I didn't care. <div class="bookquote">``Why do I have to stay in cabin eleven, anyway? Why is everybody so
crowded together? There are plenty of empty bunks right over there.''
 (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div>I pointed to the first few cabins, and Annabeth turned pale. <div class="bookquote">``You don't just choose a cabin, Percy.
It depends on who your parents are. Or ... your parent.''
 (<font color='red'><b>She</b></font>)</div>She (<font color='blue'><b>Dodds</b></font>) stared at me, waiting for me to get it.
<div class="bookquote">``My mom is Sally Jackson,''  (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div>I said. <div class="bookquote">``She (<font color='blue'><b>Jackson</b></font>) works at the candy store in Grand Central Station. At
least, she (<font color='blue'><b>Jackson</b></font>) used to.''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``I'm sorry about your mom, Percy. But that's not what I mean. I'm talking about your other parent.
Your dad.''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``He (<font color='blue'><b>dad</b></font>)'s dead. I never knew him (<font color='blue'><b>dad</b></font>).''
 (<font color='red'><b>Annabeth/ANNABETH</b></font>)</div>Annabeth sighed. Clearly, she (<font color='blue'><b>Dodds</b></font>)'d had this conversation before with other kids. <div class="bookquote">``Your father's not
dead, Percy.''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``How can you say that? You know him (<font color='blue'><b>Percy</b></font>)?''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``No, of course not.''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>``Then how can you say-``
<div class="bookquote">``Because I know you. You wouldn't be here if you weren't one of us.''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``You don't know anything about me.''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``No?''  (<font color='red'><b>She</b></font>)</div>She (<font color='blue'><b>Dodds</b></font>) raised an eyebrow. <div class="bookquote">``I bet you moved around from school to school. I bet you were
kicked out of a lot of them.''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>``How-``
<div class="bookquote">``Diagnosed with dyslexia. Probably ADHD, too.''
 (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div>I tried to swallow my embarrassment. <div class="bookquote">``What does that have to do with anything?''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>``Taken together, it's almost a sure sign. The letters float off the page when you read, right? That's
because your mind is hardwired for ancient Greek. And the ADHD-you're impulsive, can't sit still in
the classroom. That's your battlefield reflexes. In a real fight, they'd keep you alive. As for the
attention problems, that's because you see too much, Percy, not too little. Your senses are better than
a regular mortal's. Of course the teachers want you medicated. Most of them are monsters. They don't

<p/>want you seeing them for what they are.''
``You sound like ... you went through the same thing?''
``Most of the kids here did. If you weren't like us, you couldn't have survived the Minotaur, much
less the ambrosia and nectar.''
``Ambrosia and nectar.''
``The food and drink we were giving you to make you better. That stuff would've killed a normal
kid. It would've turned your blood to fire and your bones to sand and you'd be dead. Face it. You're
a half-blood.''
A half-blood.
I was reeling with so many questions I didn't know where to start.
Then a husky voice yelled, ``Well! A newbie!''
I looked over. The big girl from the ugly red cabin was sauntering toward us. She (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) had three other
girls behind her (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>), all big and ugly and mean looking like her (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>), all wearing camo jackets.
``Clarisse,'' Annabeth sighed. ``Why don't you go polish your spear or something?''
``Sure, Miss Princess,'' the big girl said. ``So I can run you through with it Friday night.<div class="bookquote">''
'' (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div>Erre es korakas!'' Annabeth said, which I somehow understood was Greek for `Go to the
crows!' though I had a feeling it was a worse curse than it sounded. ``You don't stand a chance.''
``We'll pulverize you,'' Clarisse said, but her (<font color='blue'><b>Clarisse</b></font>) eye twitched. Perhaps she (<font color='blue'><b>Clarisse</b></font>) wasn't sure she (<font color='blue'><b>Clarisse</b></font>) could
follow through on the threat. She (<font color='blue'><b>Clarisse</b></font>) turned toward me. ``Who's this little runt?''
``Percy Jackson,'' Annabeth said, ``meet Clarisse, Daughter of Ares.''
I blinked. ``Like ... the war god?''
Clarisse sneered. ``You got a problem with that?''
``No,'' I said, recovering my wits. ``It explains the bad smell.''
Clarisse growled. ``We got an initiation ceremony for newbies, Prissy.''
``Percy.''
``Whatever. Come on, I'll show you.''
``Clarisse-'' Annabeth tried to say.
``Stay out of it, wise girl.''
Annabeth looked pained, but she (<font color='blue'><b>Clarisse</b></font>) did stay out of it, and I didn't really want her (<font color='blue'><b>Clarisse</b></font>) help. I was the new
kid. I had to earn my own rep.
I handed Annabeth my minotaur horn and got ready to fight, but before I knew it, Clarisse had me
by the neck and was dragging me toward a cinder-block building that I knew immediately was the
bathroom.
I was kicking and punching. I'd been in plenty of fights before, but this big girl Clarisse had hands
like iron. She (<font color='blue'><b>Clarisse</b></font>) dragged me into the girls' bathroom. There was a line of toilets on one side and a line
of shower stalls down the other. It smelled just like any public bathroom, and I was thinking-as much
as I could think with Clarisse ripping my hair out-that if this place belonged to the gods, they
should've been able to afford classier johns.
Clarisse's friends were all laughing, and I was trying to find the strength I'd used to fight the
Minotaur, but it just wasn't there.
``Like he (<font color='blue'><b>Percy</b></font>)'s `Big Three' material,'' Clarisse said as she (<font color='blue'><b>Clarisse</b></font>) pushed me toward one of the toilets.
<div class="bookquote">``Yeah, right. Minotaur probably fell over laughing, he (<font color='blue'><b>Percy</b></font>) was so stupid looking.''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>Her (<font color='blue'><b>Clarisse</b></font>) friends snickered.
Annabeth stood in the corner, watching through her (<font color='blue'><b>Clarisse</b></font>) fingers.
Clarisse bent me over on my knees and started pushing my head toward the toilet bowl. It reeked

<p/>like rusted pipes and, well, like what goes into toilets. I strained to keep my head up. I was looking at
the scummy water, thinking, I will not go into that. I won't.
Then something happened. I felt a tug in the pit of my stomach. I heard the plumbing rumble, the
pipes shudder. Clarisse's grip on my hair loosened. Water shot out of the toilet, making an arc straight
over my head, and the next thing I knew, I was sprawled on the bathroom tiles with Clarisse
screaming behind me.
I turned just as water blasted out of the toilet again, hitting Clarisse straight in the face so hard it
pushed her (<font color='blue'><b>Clarisse</b></font>) down onto her (<font color='blue'><b>Clarisse</b></font>) butt. The water stayed on her (<font color='blue'><b>Clarisse</b></font>) like the spray from a fire hose, pushing her (<font color='blue'><b>Clarisse</b></font>)
backward into a shower stall.
She (<font color='blue'><b>Clarisse</b></font>) struggled, gasping, and her (<font color='blue'><b>Clarisse</b></font>) friends started coming toward her (<font color='blue'><b>Clarisse</b></font>). But then the other toilets
exploded, too, and six more streams of toilet water blasted them back. The showers acted up, too, and
together all the fixtures sprayed the camouflage girls right out of the bathroom, spinning them around
like pieces of garbage being washed away.
As soon as they were out the door, I felt the tug in my gut lessen, and the water shut off as quickly
as it had started.
The entire bathroom was flooded. Annabeth hadn't been spared. She (<font color='blue'><b>Clarisse</b></font>) was dripping wet, but she (<font color='blue'><b>Clarisse</b></font>)
hadn't been pushed out the door. She (<font color='blue'><b>Clarisse</b></font>) was standing in exactly the same place, staring at me in shock.
I looked down and realized I was sitting in the only dry spot in the whole room. There was a
circle of dry floor around me. I didn't have one drop of water on my clothes. Nothing.
I stood up, my legs shaky.
Annabeth said, <div class="bookquote">``How did you ...''
 (<font color='red'><b>Annabeth/ANNABETH</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``I don't know.''
 (<font color='red'><b>Annabeth/ANNABETH</b></font>)</div>We walked to the door. Outside, Clarisse and her (<font color='blue'><b>Clarisse</b></font>) friends were sprawled in the mud, and a bunch
of other campers had gathered around to gawk. Clarisse's hair was flattened across her (<font color='blue'><b>Clarisse</b></font>) face. Her (<font color='blue'><b>Clarisse</b></font>)
camouflage jacket was sopping and she (<font color='blue'><b>Clarisse</b></font>) smelled like sewage. She (<font color='blue'><b>Clarisse</b></font>) gave me a look of absolute hatred.
<div class="bookquote">``You are dead, new boy. You are totally dead.''
 (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div>I probably should have let it go, but I said, <div class="bookquote">``You want to gargle with toilet water again, Clarisse?
Close your mouth.''
 (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div>Her (<font color='blue'><b>Clarisse</b></font>) friends had to hold her (<font color='blue'><b>Clarisse</b></font>) back. They dragged her (<font color='blue'><b>Clarisse</b></font>) toward cabin five, while the other campers
made way to avoid her (<font color='blue'><b>Clarisse</b></font>) flailing feet.
Annabeth stared at me. I couldn't tell whether she (<font color='blue'><b>Clarisse</b></font>) was just grossed out or angry at me for dousing
her (<font color='blue'><b>Clarisse</b></font>).
<div class="bookquote">``What?''  (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div>I demanded. <div class="bookquote">``What are you thinking?''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``I'm thinking,''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Clarisse</b></font>) said, <div class="bookquote">``that I want you on my team for capture the flag.''

 (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div><p/>Percy Jackson 1 - The Lightning Thief
7 MY DINNER GOES
UP IN SMOKE
Word of the bathroom incident spread immediately. Wherever I went, campers pointed at me and
murmured something about toilet water. Or maybe they were just staring at Annabeth, who was still
pretty much dripping wet.
She (<font color='blue'><b>MY</b></font>) showed me a few more places: the metal shop -LRB-where kids were forging their own swords-RRB-,
the arts-and-crafts room -LRB-where satyrs were sandblasting a giant marble statue of a goat-man-RRB-, and the
climbing wall, which actually consisted of two facing walls that shook violently, dropped boulders,
sprayed lava, and clashed together if you didn't get to the top fast enough.
Finally we returned to the canoeing lake, where the trail led back to the cabins.
<div class="bookquote">``I've got training to do,''  (<font color='red'><b>Annabeth/ANNABETH</b></font>)</div>Annabeth said flatly. <div class="bookquote">``Dinner's at seven-thirty. Just follow your cabin to
the mess hall.''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``Annabeth, I'm sorry about the toilets.''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``Whatever.''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``It wasn't my fault.''
 (<font color='red'><b>She</b></font>)</div>She (<font color='blue'><b>MY</b></font>) looked at me skeptically, and I realized it was my fault. I'd made water shoot out of the
bathroom fixtures. I didn't understand how. But the toilets had responded to me. I had become one
with the plumbing.
<div class="bookquote">``You need to talk to the Oracle,''  (<font color='red'><b>Annabeth/ANNABETH</b></font>)</div>Annabeth said.
<div class="bookquote">``Who?''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``Not who. What. The Oracle. I'll ask Chiron.''
 (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div>I stared into the lake, wishing somebody would give me a straight answer for once.
I wasn't expecting anybody to be looking back at me from the bottom, so my heart skipped a beat
when I noticed two teenage girls sitting cross-legged at the base of the pier, about twenty feet below.
They wore blue jeans and shimmering green T-shirts, and their brown hair floated loose around their
shoulders as minnows darted in and out. They smiled and waved as if I were a long-lost friend.
I didn't know what else to do. I waved back.
<div class="bookquote">``Don't encourage them,''  (<font color='red'><b>Annabeth/ANNABETH</b></font>)</div>Annabeth warned. <div class="bookquote">``Naiads are terrible flirts.''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``Naiads,''  (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div>I repeated, feeling completely overwhelmed. <div class="bookquote">``That's it. I want to go home now.''
 (<font color='red'><b>Annabeth/ANNABETH</b></font>)</div>Annabeth frowned. <div class="bookquote">``Don't you get it, Percy? You are home. This is the only safe place on earth
for kids like us.''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``You mean, mentally disturbed kids?''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``I mean not human. Not totally human, anyway. Half-human.''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``Half-human and half-what?''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``I think you know.''
 (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div>I didn't want to admit it, but I was afraid I did. I felt a tingling in my limbs, a sensation I
sometimes felt when my mom talked about my dad.
<div class="bookquote">``God,''  (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div>I said. <div class="bookquote">``Half-god.''
 (<font color='red'><b>Annabeth/ANNABETH</b></font>)</div>Annabeth nodded. <div class="bookquote">``Your father isn't dead, Percy. He (<font color='blue'><b>Percy</b></font>)'s one of the Olympians.''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``That's ... crazy.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Is it? What's the most common thing gods did in the old stories? They ran around falling in love
with humans and having kids with them. Do you think they've changed their habits in the last few
millennia?''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``But those are just-''  (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div>I almost said myths again. Then I remembered Chiron's warning that in two
thousand years, I might be considered a myth. ``But if all the kids here are half-gods-``
<div class="bookquote">``Demigods,''  (<font color='red'><b>Annabeth/ANNABETH</b></font>)</div>Annabeth said. <div class="bookquote">``That's the official term. Or half-bloods.''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``Then who's your dad?''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>Her (<font color='blue'><b>mom</b></font>) hands tightened around the pier railing. I got the feeling I'd just trespassed on a sensitive
subject.
<div class="bookquote">``My dad is a professor at West Point,''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>mom</b></font>) said. <div class="bookquote">``I haven't seen him (<font color='blue'><b>dad</b></font>) since I was very small.

 (<font color='red'><b>Annabeth/ANNABETH</b></font>)</div>Annabeth straightened. <div class="bookquote">``Athena. Goddess of wisdom and battle.''
 (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div>Okay, I thought. Why not?
<div class="bookquote">``And my dad?''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``Undetermined,''  (<font color='red'><b>Annabeth/ANNABETH</b></font>)</div>Annabeth said, <div class="bookquote">``like I told you before. Nobody knows.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``Maybe not, Percy. Gods don't always reveal their identities.''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``My dad would have. He (<font color='blue'><b>dad</b></font>) loved her (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>).''
 (<font color='red'><b>Annabeth/ANNABETH</b></font>)</div>Annabeth gave me a cautious look. She (<font color='blue'><b>mom</b></font>) didn't want to burst my bubble. ``Maybe you're right.
Maybe he (<font color='blue'><b>dad</b></font>)'ll send a sign. That's the only way to know for sure: your father has to send you a sign
claiming you as his (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) son. Sometimes it happens.
``You mean sometimes it doesn't?''
Annabeth ran her (<font color='blue'><b>mom</b></font>) palm along the rail. ``The gods are busy. They have a lot of kids and they don't
always ... Well, sometimes they don't care about us, Percy. They ignore us.''
I thought about some of the kids I'd seen in the Hermes cabin, teenagers who looked sullen and
depressed, as if they were waiting for a call that would never come. I'd known kids like that at Yancy
Academy, shuffled off to boarding school by rich parents who didn't have the time to deal with them.
But gods should behave better.
``So I'm stuck here,'' I said. ``That's it? For the rest of my life?''
``It depends,'' Annabeth said. ``Some campers only stay the summer. If you're a child of Aphrodite
or Demeter, you're probably not a real powerful force. The monsters might ignore you, so you can get
by with a few months of summer training and live in the mortal world the rest of the year. But for
some of us, it's too dangerous to leave. We're year-rounders. In the mortal world, we attract
monsters. They sense us. They come to challenge us. Most of the time, they'll ignore us until we're
old enough to cause trouble-about ten or eleven years old, but after that, most demigods either make
their way here, or they get killed off. A few manage to survive in the outside world and become
famous. Believe me, if I told you the names, you'd know them. Some don't even realize they're
demigods. But very, very few are like that.''
<div class="bookquote">``So monsters can't get in here?''

 (<font color='red'><b>Annabeth/ANNABETH</b></font>)</div><p/>Annabeth shook her (<font color='blue'><b>mom</b></font>) head. <div class="bookquote">``Not unless they're intentionally stocked in the woods or specially
summoned by somebody on the inside.''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``Why would anybody want to summon a monster?''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``Practice fights. Practical jokes.''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``Practical jokes?''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``The point is, the borders are sealed to keep mortals and monsters out. From the outside, mortals
look into the valley and see nothing unusual, just a strawberry farm.''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``So ... you're a year-rounder?''
 (<font color='red'><b>Annabeth/ANNABETH</b></font>)</div>Annabeth nodded. From under the collar of her (<font color='blue'><b>mom</b></font>) T-shirt she (<font color='blue'><b>mom</b></font>) pulled a leather necklace with five
clay beads of different colors. It was just like Luke's, except Annabeth's also had a big gold ring
strung on it, like a college ring.
<div class="bookquote">``I've been here since I was seven,''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>mom</b></font>) said. <div class="bookquote">``Every August, on the last day of summer session,
you get a bead for surviving another year. I've been here longer than most of the counselors, and
they're all in college.''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``Why did you come so young?''
 (<font color='red'><b>She</b></font>)</div>She (<font color='blue'><b>mom</b></font>) twisted the ring on her (<font color='blue'><b>mom</b></font>) necklace. <div class="bookquote">``None of your business.''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``Oh.''  (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div>I stood there for a minute in uncomfortable silence. <div class="bookquote">``So ... I could just walk out of here
right now if I wanted to?''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``It would be suicide, but you could, with Mr. D's or Chiron's permission. But they wouldn't give
permission until the end of the summer session unless ...''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``Unless?''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``You were granted a quest. But that hardly ever happens. The last time ...''
 (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div>Her (<font color='blue'><b>mom</b></font>) voice trailed off. I could tell from her (<font color='blue'><b>mom</b></font>) tone that the last time hadn't gone well.
<div class="bookquote">``Back in the sick room,''  (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div>I said, ``when you were feeding me that stuff-``
<div class="bookquote">``Ambrosia.''
 (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``Yeah. You asked me something about the summer solstice.''
 (<font color='red'><b>Annabeth/ANNABETH</b></font>)</div>Annabeth's shoulders tensed. <div class="bookquote">``So you do know something?''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``Well... no. Back at my old school, I overheard Grover and Chiron talking about it. Grover
mentioned the summer solstice. He (<font color='blue'><b>Grover</b></font>) said something like we didn't have much time, because of the
deadline. What did that mean?''
 (<font color='red'><b>She</b></font>)</div>She (<font color='blue'><b>mom</b></font>) clenched her (<font color='blue'><b>mom</b></font>) fists. <div class="bookquote">``I wish I knew. Chiron and the satyrs, they know, but they won't tell me.
Something is wrong in Olympus, something pretty major. Last time I was there, everything seemed so
normal.''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``You've been to Olympus?''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``Some of us year-rounders-Luke and Clarisse and I and a few others-we took a field trip during
winter solstice. That's when the gods have their big annual council.''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``But... how did you get there?''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``The Long Island Railroad, of course. You get off at Penn Station. Empire State Building, special
elevator to the six hundredth floor.''  (<font color='red'><b>She</b></font>)</div>She (<font color='blue'><b>mom</b></font>) looked at me like she (<font color='blue'><b>mom</b></font>) was sure I must know this already.
<div class="bookquote">``You are a New Yorker, right?''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``Oh, sure.''  (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div>As far as I knew, there were only a hundred and two floors in the Empire State
Building, but I decided not to point that out.
<div class="bookquote">``Right after we visited,''  (<font color='red'><b>Annabeth/ANNABETH</b></font>)</div>Annabeth continued, ``the weather got weird, as if the gods had started
fighting. A couple of times since, I've overheard satyrs talking. The best I can figure out is that
something important was stolen. And if it isn't returned by summer solstice, there's going to be

<p/>trouble. When you came, I was hoping ... I mean- Athena can get along with just about anybody,
except for Ares. And of course she (<font color='blue'><b>Athena</b></font>)'s got the rivalry with Poseidon. But, I mean, aside from that, I
thought we could work together. I thought you might know something.''
I shook my head. I wished I could help her (<font color='blue'><b>mom</b></font>), but I felt too hungry and tired and mentally overloaded
to ask any more questions.
``I've got to get a quest,'' Annabeth muttered to herself. ``I'm not too young. If they would just tell
me the problem ...''
I could smell barbecue smoke coming from somewhere nearby. Annabeth must've heard my
stomach growl. She (<font color='blue'><b>mom</b></font>) told me to go on, she (<font color='blue'><b>mom</b></font>)'d catch me later. I left her (<font color='blue'><b>mom</b></font>) on the pier, tracing her (<font color='blue'><b>mom</b></font>) finger
across the rail as if drawing a battle plan.
Back at cabin eleven, everybody was talking and horsing around, waiting for dinner. For the first
time, I noticed that a lot of the campers had similar features: sharp noses, upturned eyebrows,
mischievous smiles. They were the kind of kids that teachers would peg as troublemakers. Thankfully,
nobody paid much attention to me as I walked over to my spot on the floor and plopped down with my
minotaur horn.
The counselor, Luke, came over. He (<font color='blue'><b>Luke</b></font>) had the Hermes family resemblance, too. It was marred by
that scar on his (<font color='blue'><b>Luke</b></font>) right cheek, but his (<font color='blue'><b>Luke</b></font>) smile was intact.
``Found you a sleeping bag,'' he (<font color='blue'><b>Luke</b></font>) said. ``And here, I stole you some toiletries from the camp store.''
I couldn't tell if he (<font color='blue'><b>Luke</b></font>) was kidding about the stealing part.
I said, ``Thanks.''
``No prob.'' Luke sat next to me, pushed his (<font color='blue'><b>Luke</b></font>) back against the wall. ``Tough first day?''
``I don't belong here,'' I said. ``I don't even believe in gods.''
``Yeah,'' he (<font color='blue'><b>Luke</b></font>) said. ``That's how we all started. Once you start believing in them? It doesn't get any
easier.''
The bitterness in his (<font color='blue'><b>Luke</b></font>) voice surprised me, because Luke seemed like a pretty easygoing guy. He (<font color='blue'><b>Luke</b></font>)
looked like he (<font color='blue'><b>Luke</b></font>) could handle just about anything.
``So your dad is Hermes?'' I asked.
He (<font color='blue'><b>Luke</b></font>) pulled a switchblade out of his (<font color='blue'><b>Luke</b></font>) back pocket, and for a second I thought he (<font color='blue'><b>Luke</b></font>) was going to gut me,
but he (<font color='blue'><b>Luke</b></font>) just scraped the mud off the sole of his (<font color='blue'><b>Luke</b></font>) sandal. ``Yeah. Hermes.''
``The wing-footed messenger guy.''
``That's him (<font color='blue'><b>guy</b></font>). Messengers. Medicine. Travelers, merchants, thieves. Anybody who uses the roads.
That's why you're here, enjoying cabin eleven's hospitality. Hermes isn't picky about who he (<font color='blue'><b>guy</b></font>)
sponsors.''
I figured Luke didn't mean to call me a nobody. He (<font color='blue'><b>Luke</b></font>) just had a lot on his (<font color='blue'><b>Luke</b></font>) mind.
``You ever meet your dad?'' I asked.
``Once.''
I waited, thinking that if he (<font color='blue'><b>Luke</b></font>) wanted to tell me, he (<font color='blue'><b>Luke</b></font>)'d tell me. Apparently, he (<font color='blue'><b>Luke</b></font>) didn't. I wondered if
the story had anything to do with how he (<font color='blue'><b>Luke</b></font>) got his (<font color='blue'><b>Luke</b></font>) scar.
Luke looked up and managed a smile. <div class="bookquote">``Don't worry about it, Percy. The campers here, they're
mostly good people. After all, we're extended family, right? We take care of each other.''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>He (<font color='blue'><b>Luke</b></font>) seemed to understand how lost I felt, and I was grateful for that, because an older guy like
him-even if he (<font color='blue'><b>guy</b></font>) was a counselor-should've steered clear of an uncool middle-schooler like me. But
Luke had welcomed me into the cabin. He (<font color='blue'><b>Luke</b></font>)'d even stolen me some toiletries, which was the nicest
thing anybody had done for me all day.
I decided to ask him (<font color='blue'><b>Luke</b></font>) my last big question, the one that had been bothering me all afternoon.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Clarisse, from Ares, was joking about me being `Big Three' material. Then Annabeth ... twice, she (<font color='blue'><b>Clarisse</b></font>)
said I might be `the one.' She (<font color='blue'><b>Clarisse</b></font>) said I should talk to the Oracle. What was that all about?''
 (<font color='red'><b>Luke</b></font>)</div>Luke folded his (<font color='blue'><b>Luke</b></font>) knife. <div class="bookquote">``I hate prophecies.''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``What do you mean?''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>His (<font color='blue'><b>Luke</b></font>) face twitched around the scar. <div class="bookquote">``Let's just say I messed things up for everybody else. The last
two years, ever since my trip to the Garden of the Hesperides went sour, Chiron hasn't allowed any
more quests. Annabeth's been dying to get out into the world. She (<font color='blue'><b>Clarisse</b></font>) pestered Chiron so much he (<font color='blue'><b>I</b></font>) finally
told her (<font color='blue'><b>Clarisse</b></font>) he (<font color='blue'><b>I</b></font>) already knew her (<font color='blue'><b>Clarisse</b></font>) fate. He (<font color='blue'><b>I</b></font>)'d had a prophecy from the Oracle. He (<font color='blue'><b>I</b></font>) wouldn't tell her (<font color='blue'><b>Clarisse</b></font>) the
whole thing, but he (<font color='blue'><b>I</b></font>) said Annabeth wasn't destined to go on a quest yet. She (<font color='blue'><b>Clarisse</b></font>) had to wait until...
somebody special came to the camp.''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``Somebody special?''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``Don't worry about it, kid,''  (<font color='red'><b>Luke</b></font>)</div>Luke said. <div class="bookquote">``Annabeth wants to think every new camper who comes
through here is the omen she (<font color='blue'><b>Clarisse</b></font>)'s been waiting for. Now, come on, it's dinnertime.''
 (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>The moment he (<font color='blue'><b>Luke</b></font>) said it, a horn blew in the distance. Somehow, I knew it was a conch shell, even
though I'd never heard one before.
Luke yelled, <div class="bookquote">``Eleven, fall in!''
 (<font color='red'><b>Luke</b></font>)</div>The whole cabin, about twenty of us, filed into the commons yard. We lined up in order of
seniority, so of course I was dead last. Campers came from the other cabins, too, except for the three
empty cabins at the end, and cabin eight, which had looked normal in the daytime, but was now
starting to glow silver as the sun went down.
We marched up the hill to the mess hall pavilion. Satyrs joined us from the meadow. Naiads
emerged from the canoeing lake. A few other girls came out of the woods- and when I say out of the
woods, I mean straight out of the woods. I saw one girl, about nine or ten years old, melt from the
side of a maple tree and come skipping up the hill.
In all, there were maybe a hundred campers, a few dozen satyrs, and a dozen assorted wood
nymphs and naiads.
At the pavilion, torches blazed around the marble columns. A central fire burned in a bronze
brazier the size of a bathtub. Each cabin had its own table, covered in white cloth trimmed in purple.
Four of the tables were empty, but cabin eleven's was way overcrowded. I had to squeeze on to the
edge of a bench with half my butt hanging off.
I saw Grover sitting at table twelve with Mr. D, a few satyrs, and a couple of plump blond boys
who looked just like Mr. D. Chiron stood to one side, the picnic table being way too small for a
centaur.
Annabeth sat at table six with a bunch of serious-looking athletic kids, all with her (<font color='blue'><b>Mr.</b></font>) gray eyes and
honey-blond hair.
Clarisse sat behind me at Ares's table. She (<font color='blue'><b>Clarisse</b></font>)'d apparently gotten over being hosed down, because
she (<font color='blue'><b>Clarisse</b></font>) was laughing and belching right alongside her (<font color='blue'><b>Clarisse</b></font>) friends.
Finally, Chiron pounded his (<font color='blue'><b>Mr.</b></font>) hoof against the marble floor of the pavilion, and everybody fell
silent. He (<font color='blue'><b>Mr.</b></font>) raised a glass. <div class="bookquote">``To the gods!''
 (<font color='red'><b>Everybody</b></font>)</div>Everybody else raised their glasses. <div class="bookquote">``To the gods!''
 (<font color='red'><b>Wood</b></font>)</div>Wood nymphs came forward with platters of food: grapes, apples, strawberries, cheese, fresh
bread, and yes, barbecue! My glass was empty, but Luke said, <div class="bookquote">``Speak to it. Whatever you wantnonalcoholic, of course.''
 (<font color='red'><b>Luke</b></font>)</div>I said, <div class="bookquote">``Cherry Coke.''
 (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div>The glass filled with sparkling caramel liquid.

<p/>Then I had an idea. <div class="bookquote">``Blue Cherry Coke.''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>The soda turned a violent shade of cobalt.
I took a cautious sip. Perfect.
I drank a toast to my mother.
She (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>)'s not gone, I told myself. Not permanently, anyway. She (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>)'s in the Underworld. And if that's a
real place, then someday...
<div class="bookquote">``Here you go, Percy,''  (<font color='red'><b>Luke</b></font>)</div>Luke said, handing me a platter of smoked brisket.
I loaded my plate and was about to take a big bite when I noticed everybody getting up, carrying
their plates toward the fire in the center of the pavilion. I wondered if they were going for dessert or
something.
<div class="bookquote">``Come on,''  (<font color='red'><b>Luke</b></font>)</div>Luke told me.
As I got closer, I saw that everyone was taking a portion of their meal and dropping it into the
fire, the ripest strawberry, the juiciest slice of beef, the warmest, most buttery roll.
Luke murmured in my ear, <div class="bookquote">``Burnt offerings for the gods. They like the smell.''
 (<font color='red'><b>Luke</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``You're kidding.''
 (<font color='red'><b>me</b></font>)</div>His (<font color='blue'><b>Luke</b></font>) look warned me not to take this lightly, but I couldn't help wondering why an immortal, allpowerful being would like the smell of burning food.
Luke approached the fire, bowed his (<font color='blue'><b>Luke</b></font>) head, and tossed in a cluster of fat red grapes. <div class="bookquote">``Hermes.''
 (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div>I was next.
I wished I knew what god's name to say.
Finally, I made a silent plea. Whoever you are, tell me. Please.
I scraped a big slice of brisket into the flames.
When I caught a whiff of the smoke, I didn't gag.
It smelled nothing like burning food. It smelled of hot chocolate and fresh-baked brownies,
hamburgers on the grill and wildflowers, and a hundred other good things that shouldn't have gone
well together, but did. I could almost believe the gods could live off that smoke.
When everybody had returned to their seats and finished eating their meals, Chiron pounded his (<font color='blue'><b>It</b></font>)
hoof again for our attention.
Mr. D got up with a huge sigh. <div class="bookquote">``Yes, I suppose I'd better say hello to all you brats. Well, hello.
Our activities director, Chiron, says the next capture the flag is Friday. Cabin five presently holds the
laurels.''
 (<font color='red'><b>Ares</b></font>)</div>A bunch of ugly cheering rose from the Ares table.
<div class="bookquote">``Personally,''  (<font color='red'><b>Mr.</b></font>)</div>Mr. D continued, <div class="bookquote">``I couldn't care less, but congratulations. Also, I should tell you
that we have a new camper today. Peter Johnson.''
 (<font color='red'><b>Mr.</b></font>)</div>Chiron murmured something.
<div class="bookquote">``Er, Percy Jackson,''  (<font color='red'><b>Mr.</b></font>)</div>Mr. D corrected. <div class="bookquote">``That's right. Hurrah, and all that. Now run along to your
silly campfire. Go on.''
 (<font color='red'><b>Everybody</b></font>)</div>Everybody cheered. We all headed down toward the amphitheater, where Apollo's cabin led a
sing-along. We sang camp songs about the gods and ate s'mores and joked around, and the funny thing
was, I didn't feel that anyone was staring at me anymore. I felt that I was home.
Later in the evening, when the sparks from the campfire were curling into a starry sky, the conch
horn blew again, and we all filed back to our cabins. I didn't realize how exhausted I was until I
collapsed on my borrowed sleeping bag.
My fingers curled around the Minotaur's horn. I thought about my mom, but I had good thoughts:
her (<font color='blue'><b>mom</b></font>) smile, the bedtime stories she (<font color='blue'><b>mom</b></font>) would read me when I was a kid, the way she (<font color='blue'><b>mom</b></font>) would tell me not to

<p/>let the bedbugs bite.
When I closed my eyes, I fell asleep instantly.
That was my first day at Camp Half-Blood.
I wish I'd known how briefly I would get to enjoy my new home.

<p/>Percy Jackson 1 - The Lightning Thief
8 WE CAPTURE
A FLAG
The next few days I settled into a routine that felt almost normal, if you don't count the fact that I
was getting lessons from satyrs, nymphs, and a centaur.
Each morning I took Ancient Greek from Annabeth, and we talked about the gods and goddesses
in the present tense, which was kind of weird. I discovered Annabeth was right about my dyslexia:
Ancient Greek wasn't that hard for me to read. At least, no harder than English. After a couple of
mornings, I could stumble through a few lines of Homer without too much headache.
The rest of the day, I'd rotate through outdoor activities, looking for something I was good at.
Chiron tried to teach me archery, but we found out pretty quick I wasn't any good with a bow and
arrow. He (<font color='blue'><b>Homer</b></font>) didn't complain, even when he (<font color='blue'><b>Homer</b></font>) had to desnag a stray arrow out of his (<font color='blue'><b>Homer</b></font>) tail.
Foot racing? No good either. The wood-nymph instructors left me in the dust. They told me not to
worry about it. They'd had centuries of practice running away from lovesick gods. But still, it was a
little humiliating to be slower than a tree.
And wrestling? Forget it. Every time I got on the mat, Clarisse would pulverize me.
<div class="bookquote">``There's more where that came from, punk,''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Clarisse</b></font>)'d mumble in my ear.
The only thing I really excelled at was canoeing, and that wasn't the kind of heroic skill people
expected to see from the kid who had beaten the Minotaur.
I knew the senior campers and counselors were watching me, trying to decide who my dad was,
but they weren't having an easy time of it. I wasn't as strong as the Ares kids, or as good at archery as
the Apollo kids. I didn't have Hephaestus's skill with metalwork or-gods forbid- Dionysus's way
with vine plants. Luke told me I might be a child of Hermes, a kind of jack-of-all-trades, master of
none. But I got the feeling he (<font color='blue'><b>master</b></font>) was just trying to make me feel better. He (<font color='blue'><b>master</b></font>) really didn't know what to
make of me either.
Despite all that, I liked camp. I got used to the morning fog over the beach, the smell of hot
strawberry fields in the afternoon, even the weird noises of monsters in the woods at night. I would
eat dinner with cabin eleven, scrape part of my meal into the fire, and try to feel some connection to
my real dad. Nothing came. Just that warm feeling I'd always had, like the memory of his (<font color='blue'><b>dad</b></font>) smile. I
tried not to think too much about my mom, but I kept wondering: if gods and monsters were real, if all
this magical stuff was possible, surely there was some way to save her (<font color='blue'><b>mom</b></font>), to bring her (<font color='blue'><b>mom</b></font>) back....
I started to understand Luke's bitterness and how he (<font color='blue'><b>Luke</b></font>) seemed to resent his (<font color='blue'><b>Luke</b></font>) father, Hermes. So okay,
maybe gods had important things to do. But couldn't they call once in a while, or thunder, or
something? Dionysus could make Diet Coke appear out of thin air. Why couldn't my dad, whoever he (<font color='blue'><b>dad</b></font>)
was, make a phone appear?
Thursday afternoon, three days after I'd arrived at Camp Half-Blood, I had my first swordfighting lesson. Everybody from cabin eleven gathered in the big circular arena, where Luke would be
our instructor.
We started with basic stabbing and slashing, using some straw-stuffed dummies in Greek armor. I
guess I did okay. At least, I understood what I was supposed to do and my reflexes were good.
The problem was, I couldn't find a blade that felt right in my hands. Either they were too heavy,

<p/>or too light, or too long. Luke tried his (<font color='blue'><b>Luke</b></font>) best to fix me up, but he (<font color='blue'><b>Luke</b></font>) agreed that none of the practice blades
seemed to work for me.
We moved on to dueling in pairs. Luke announced he (<font color='blue'><b>Luke</b></font>) would be my partner, since this was my first
time.
<div class="bookquote">``Good luck,''  (<font color='red'><b>the campers</b></font>)</div>one of the campers told me. <div class="bookquote">``Luke's the best swordsman in the last three hundred
years.''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``Maybe he (<font color='blue'><b>Luke</b></font>)'ll go easy on me,''  (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div>I said.
The camper snorted.
Luke showed me thrusts and parries and shield blocks the hard way. With every swipe, I got a
little more battered and bruised. <div class="bookquote">``Keep your guard up, Percy,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Luke</b></font>)'d say, then whap me in the ribs
with the flat of his (<font color='blue'><b>Luke</b></font>) blade. <div class="bookquote">``No, not that far up!''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>Whap! <div class="bookquote">``Lunge!''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>Whap! <div class="bookquote">``Now, back!''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>Whap!
By the time he (<font color='blue'><b>Luke</b></font>) called a break, I was soaked in sweat. Everybody swarmed the drinks cooler. Luke
poured ice water on his (<font color='blue'><b>Luke</b></font>) head, which looked like such a good idea, I did the same.
Instantly, I felt better. Strength surged back into my arms. The sword didn't feel so awkward.
<div class="bookquote">``Okay, everybody circle up!''  (<font color='red'><b>Luke</b></font>)</div>Luke ordered. <div class="bookquote">``If Percy doesn't mind, I want to give you a little
demo.''
 (<font color='red'><b>Great</b></font>)</div>Great, I thought. Let's all watch Percy get pounded.
The Hermes guys gathered around. They were suppressing smiles. I figured they'd been in my
shoes before and couldn't wait to see how Luke used me for a punching bag. He (<font color='blue'><b>Luke</b></font>) told everybody he (<font color='blue'><b>Luke</b></font>)
was going to demonstrate a disarming technique: how to twist the enemy's blade with the flat of your
own sword so that he (<font color='blue'><b>Luke</b></font>) had no choice but to drop his (<font color='blue'><b>Luke</b></font>) weapon.
<div class="bookquote">``This is difficult,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Luke</b></font>) stressed. <div class="bookquote">``I've had it used against me. No laughing at Percy, now. Most
swordsmen have to work years to master this technique.''
 (<font color='red'><b>He</b></font>)</div>He (<font color='blue'><b>Luke</b></font>) demonstrated the move on me in slow motion. Sure enough, the sword clattered out of my
hand.
<div class="bookquote">``Now in real time,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Luke</b></font>) said, after I'd retrieved my weapon. <div class="bookquote">``We keep sparring until one of us
pulls it off. Ready, Percy?''
 (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div>I nodded, and Luke came after me. Somehow, I kept him (<font color='blue'><b>Luke</b></font>) from getting a shot at the hilt of my
sword. My senses opened up. I saw his (<font color='blue'><b>Luke</b></font>) attacks coming. I countered. I stepped forward and tried a
thrust of my own. Luke deflected it easily, but I saw a change in his (<font color='blue'><b>Luke</b></font>) face. His (<font color='blue'><b>Luke</b></font>) eyes narrowed, and he (<font color='blue'><b>Luke</b></font>)
started to press me with more force.
The sword grew heavy in my hand. The balance wasn't right. I knew it was only a matter of
seconds before Luke took me down, so I figured, What the heck?
I tried the disarming maneuver.
My blade hit the base of Luke's and I twisted, putting my whole weight into a downward thrust.
Clang.
Luke's sword rattled against the stones. The tip of my blade was an inch from his (<font color='blue'><b>Luke</b></font>) undefended
chest.
The other campers were silent.
I lowered my sword. <div class="bookquote">``Um, sorry.''
 (<font color='red'><b>Luke</b></font>)</div>For a moment, Luke was too stunned to speak.
<div class="bookquote">``Sorry?''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>His (<font color='blue'><b>Luke</b></font>) scarred face broke into a grin. <div class="bookquote">``By the gods, Percy, why are you sorry? Show me
that again!''
 (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div>I didn't want to. The short burst of manic energy had completely abandoned me. But Luke insisted.
This time, there was no contest. The moment our swords connected, Luke hit my hilt and sent my

<p/>weapon skidding across the floor.
After a long pause, somebody in the audience said, <div class="bookquote">``Beginner's luck?''
 (<font color='red'><b>the audience</b></font>)</div>Luke wiped the sweat off his (<font color='blue'><b>Luke</b></font>) brow. He (<font color='blue'><b>Luke</b></font>) appraised at me with an entirely new interest. <div class="bookquote">``Maybe,''
 (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Luke</b></font>) said. <div class="bookquote">``But I wonder what Percy could do with a balanced sword... .''
 (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div>Friday afternoon, I was sitting with Grover at the lake, resting from a near-death experience on
the climbing wall. Grover had scampered to the top like a mountain goat, but the lava had almost
gotten me. My shirt had smoking holes in it. The hairs had been singed off my forearms.
We sat on the pier, watching the naiads do underwater basket-weaving, until I got up the nerve to
ask Grover how his (<font color='blue'><b>Grover</b></font>) conversation had gone with Mr. D.
His (<font color='blue'><b>Grover</b></font>) face turned a sickly shade of yellow.
<div class="bookquote">``Fine,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Grover</b></font>) said. <div class="bookquote">``Just great.''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``So your career's still on track?''
 (<font color='red'><b>He</b></font>)</div>He (<font color='blue'><b>Grover</b></font>) glanced at me nervously. <div class="bookquote">``Chiron t-told you I want a searcher's license?''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``Well... no.''  (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div>I had no idea what a searcher's license was, but it didn't seem like the right time to
ask. <div class="bookquote">``He (<font color='blue'><b>Percy</b></font>) just said you had big plans, you know ... and that you needed credit for completing a
keeper's assignment. So did you get it?''
 (<font color='red'><b>Grover/Grover Underwood/GROVER</b></font>)</div>Grover looked down at the naiads. <div class="bookquote">``Mr. D suspended judgment. He (<font color='blue'><b>Mr.</b></font>) said I hadn't failed or
succeeded with you yet, so our fates were still tied together. If you got a quest and I went along to
protect you, and we both came back alive, then maybe he (<font color='blue'><b>Mr.</b></font>)'d consider the job complete.''
 (<font color='red'><b>spirits</b></font>)</div>My spirits lifted. <div class="bookquote">``Well, that's not so bad, right?''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``Blaa-ha-ha! He (<font color='blue'><b>Mr.</b></font>) might as well have transferred me to stable-cleaning duty. The chances of you
getting a quest... and even if you did, why would you want me along?''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``Of course I'd want you along!''
 (<font color='red'><b>Grover/Grover Underwood/GROVER</b></font>)</div>Grover stared glumly into the water. <div class="bookquote">``Basket-weaving ... Must be nice to have a useful skill.''
 (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div>I tried to reassure him (<font color='blue'><b>Grover</b></font>) that he (<font color='blue'><b>Grover</b></font>) had lots of talents, but that just made him (<font color='blue'><b>Grover</b></font>) look more miserable. We
talked about canoeing and swordplay for a while, then debated the pros and cons of the different
gods. Finally, I asked him (<font color='blue'><b>Grover</b></font>) about the four empty cabins.
<div class="bookquote">``Number eight, the silver one, belongs to Artemis,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Grover</b></font>) said. <div class="bookquote">``She (<font color='blue'><b>Mr.</b></font>) vowed to be a maiden forever.
So of course, no kids. The cabin is, you know, honorary. If she (<font color='blue'><b>Mr.</b></font>) didn't have one, she (<font color='blue'><b>Mr.</b></font>)'d be mad.''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``Yeah, okay. But the other three, the ones at the end. Are those the Big Three?''
 (<font color='red'><b>Grover/Grover Underwood/GROVER</b></font>)</div>Grover tensed. We were getting close to a touchy subject. <div class="bookquote">``No. One of them, number two, is
Hera's,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Grover</b></font>) said. <div class="bookquote">``That's another honorary thing. She (<font color='blue'><b>Mr.</b></font>)'s the goddess of marriage, so of course she (<font color='blue'><b>Mr.</b></font>)
wouldn't go around having affairs with mortals. That's her (<font color='blue'><b>Mr.</b></font>) husband's job. When we say the Big
Three, we mean the three powerful brothers, the sons of Kronos.''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``Zeus, Poseidon, Hades.''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``Right. You know. After the great battle with the Titans, they took over the world from their dad
and drew lots to decide who got what.''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``Zeus got the sky,''  (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div>I remembered. <div class="bookquote">``Poseidon the sea, Hades the Underworld.''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``Uh-huh.''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``But Hades doesn't have a cabin here.''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``No. He (<font color='blue'><b>Zeus</b></font>) doesn't have a throne on Olympus, either. He (<font color='blue'><b>Zeus</b></font>) sort of does his (<font color='blue'><b>Zeus</b></font>) own thing down in the
Underworld. If he (<font color='blue'><b>Zeus</b></font>) did have a cabin here ...''  (<font color='red'><b>Grover/Grover Underwood/GROVER</b></font>)</div>Grover shuddered. <div class="bookquote">``Well, it wouldn't be pleasant. Let's
leave it at that.''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``But Zeus and Poseidon-they both had, like, a bazillion kids in the myths. Why are their cabins
empty?''

 (<font color='red'><b>Grover/Grover Underwood/GROVER</b></font>)</div><p/>Grover shifted his (<font color='blue'><b>Grover</b></font>) hooves uncomfortably. <div class="bookquote">``About sixty years ago, after World War II, the Big
Three agreed they wouldn't sire any more heroes. Their children were just too powerful. They were
affecting the course of human events too much, causing too much carnage. World War II, you know,
that was basically a fight between the sons of Zeus and Poseidon on one side, and the sons of Hades
on the other. The winning side, Zeus and Poseidon, made Hades swear an oath with them: no more
affairs with mortal women. They all swore on the River Styx.''
 (<font color='red'><b>Thunder</b></font>)</div>Thunder boomed.
I said, <div class="bookquote">``That's the most serious oath you can make.''
 (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div>Grover nodded.
<div class="bookquote">``And the brothers kept their word-no kids?''
 (<font color='red'><b>Grover/Grover Underwood/GROVER</b></font>)</div>Grover's face darkened. <div class="bookquote">``Seventeen years ago, Zeus fell off the wagon. There was this TV starlet
with a big fluffy eighties hairdo-he just couldn't help himself. When their child was born, a little girl
named Thalia .. . well, the River Styx is serious about promises. Zeus himself got off easy because
he (<font color='blue'><b>Zeus</b></font>)'s immortal, but he (<font color='blue'><b>Zeus</b></font>) brought a terrible fate on his (<font color='blue'><b>Zeus</b></font>) daughter.''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``But that isn't fair.' It wasn't the little girl's fault.''
 (<font color='red'><b>Grover/Grover Underwood/GROVER</b></font>)</div>Grover hesitated. <div class="bookquote">``Percy, children of the Big Three have powers greater than other half-bloods.
They have a strong aura, a scent that attracts monsters. When Hades found out about the girl, he (<font color='blue'><b>Percy</b></font>)
wasn't too happy about Zeus breaking his (<font color='blue'><b>Zeus</b></font>) oath. Hades let the worst monsters out of Tartarus to
torment Thalia. A satyr was assigned to be her (<font color='blue'><b>Thalia</b></font>) keeper when she (<font color='blue'><b>Thalia</b></font>) was twelve, but there was nothing he (<font color='blue'><b>keeper</b></font>)
could do. He (<font color='blue'><b>keeper</b></font>) tried to escort her (<font color='blue'><b>Thalia</b></font>) here with a couple of other half-bloods she (<font color='blue'><b>Thalia</b></font>)'d befriended. They
almost made it. They got all the way to the top of that hill.''
 (<font color='red'><b>He</b></font>)</div>He (<font color='blue'><b>Grover</b></font>) pointed across the valley, to the pine tree where I'd fought the minotaur. <div class="bookquote">``All three Kindly
Ones were after them, along with a horde of hellhounds. They were about to be overrun when Thalia
told her (<font color='blue'><b>Thalia</b></font>) satyr to take the other two half-bloods to safety while she (<font color='blue'><b>Thalia</b></font>) held off the monsters. She (<font color='blue'><b>Thalia</b></font>) was
wounded and tired, and she (<font color='blue'><b>Thalia</b></font>) didn't want to live like a hunted animal. The satyr didn't want to leave
her (<font color='blue'><b>Thalia</b></font>), but he (<font color='blue'><b>Thalia</b></font>) couldn't change her (<font color='blue'><b>Thalia</b></font>) mind, and he (<font color='blue'><b>Thalia</b></font>) had to protect the others. So Thalia made her (<font color='blue'><b>Thalia</b></font>) final stand
alone, at the top of that hill. As she (<font color='blue'><b>Thalia</b></font>) died, Zeus took pity on her (<font color='blue'><b>Thalia</b></font>). He (<font color='blue'><b>Zeus</b></font>) turned her (<font color='blue'><b>Thalia</b></font>) into that pine tree. Her (<font color='blue'><b>Thalia</b></font>)
spirit still helps protect the borders of the valley. That's why the hill is called Half-Blood Hill.''
 (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div>I stared at the pine in the distance.
The story made me feel hollow, and guilty too. A girl my age had sacrificed herself to save her (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>)
friends. She (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) had faced a whole army of monsters. Next to that, my victory over the Minotaur didn't
seem like much. I wondered, if I'd acted differently, could I have saved my mother?
<div class="bookquote">``Grover,''  (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div>I said, <div class="bookquote">``have heroes really gone on quests to the Underworld?''
 (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``Sometimes,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Grover</b></font>) said. <div class="bookquote">``Orpheus. Hercules. Houdini.''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``And have they ever returned somebody from the dead?''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>``No. Never. Orpheus came close... . Percy, you're not seriously thinking-``
<div class="bookquote">``No,''  (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div>I lied. <div class="bookquote">``I was just wondering. So ... a satyr is always assigned to guard a demigod?''
 (<font color='red'><b>Grover/Grover Underwood/GROVER</b></font>)</div>Grover studied me warily. I hadn't persuaded him (<font color='blue'><b>Grover</b></font>) that I'd really dropped the Underworld idea.
<div class="bookquote">``Not always. We go undercover to a lot of schools. We try to sniff out the half-bloods who have the
makings of great heroes. If we find one with a very strong aura, like a child of the Big Three, we alert
Chiron. He (<font color='blue'><b>Percy</b></font>) tries to keep an eye on them, since they could cause really huge problems.''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``And you found me. Chiron said you thought I might be something special.''
 (<font color='red'><b>Grover/Grover Underwood/GROVER</b></font>)</div>Grover looked as if I'd just led him (<font color='blue'><b>Grover</b></font>) into a trap. ``I didn't... Oh, listen, don't think like that. If you
were-you know-you'd never ever be allowed a quest, and I'd never get my license. You're probably
a child of Hermes. Or maybe even one of the minor gods, like Nemesis, the god of revenge. Don't

<p/>worry, okay?''
I got the idea he (<font color='blue'><b>Grover</b></font>) was reassuring himself more than me.
That night after dinner, there was a lot more excitement than usual.
At last, it was time for capture the flag.
When the plates were cleared away, the conch horn sounded and we all stood at our tables.
Campers yelled and cheered as Annabeth and two of her (<font color='blue'><b>himself</b></font>) siblings ran into the pavilion carrying a
silk banner. It was about ten feet long, glistening gray, with a painting of a barn owl above an olive
tree. From the opposite side of the pavilion, Clarisse and her (<font color='blue'><b>Clarisse</b></font>) buddies ran in with another banner, of
identical size, but gaudy red, painted with a bloody spear and a boar's head.
I turned to Luke and yelled over the noise, ``Those are the flags?''
``Yeah.''
``Ares and Athena always lead the teams?''
``Not always,'' he (<font color='blue'><b>Luke</b></font>) said. ``But often.''
``So, if another cabin captures one, what do you do- repaint the flag?''
He (<font color='blue'><b>Luke</b></font>) grinned. ``You'll see. First we have to get one.''
``Whose side are we on?''
He (<font color='blue'><b>Luke</b></font>) gave me a sly look, as if he (<font color='blue'><b>Luke</b></font>) knew something I didn't. The scar on his (<font color='blue'><b>Luke</b></font>) face made him (<font color='blue'><b>Luke</b></font>) look
almost evil in the torchlight. ``We've made a temporary alliance with Athena. Tonight, we get the flag
from Ares. And you are going to help.''
The teams were announced. Athena had made an alliance with Apollo and Hermes, the two
biggest cabins. Apparently, privileges had been traded-shower times, chore schedules, the best slots
for activities-in order to win support.
Ares had allied themselves with everybody else: Dionysus, Demeter, Aphrodite, and Hephaestus.
From what I'd seen, Dionysus's kids were actually good athletes, but there were only two of them.
Demeter's kids had the edge with nature skills and outdoor stuff but they weren't very aggressive.
Aphrodite's sons and daughters I wasn't too worried about. They mostly sat out every activity and
checked their reflections in the lake and did their hair and gossiped. Hephaestus's kids weren't pretty,
and there were only four of them, but they were big and burly from working in the metal shop all day.
They might be a problem. That, of course, left Ares's cabin: a dozen of the biggest, ugliest, meanest
kids on Long Island, or anywhere else on the planet.
Chiron hammered his (<font color='blue'><b>Long</b></font>) hoof on the marble.
``Heroes!'' he (<font color='blue'><b>Long</b></font>) announced. ``You know the rules. The creek is the boundary line. The entire forest is
fair game. All magic items are allowed. The banner must be prominently displayed, and have no more
than two guards. Prisoners may be disarmed, but may not be bound or gagged. No killing or maiming
is allowed. I will serve as referee and battlefield medic. Arm yourselves!''
He (<font color='blue'><b>Long</b></font>) spread his (<font color='blue'><b>Long</b></font>) hands, and the tables were suddenly covered with equipment: helmets, bronze
swords, spears, oxhide shields coated in metal.
``Whoa,'' I said. ``We're really supposed to use these?''
Luke looked at me as if I were crazy. ``Unless you want to get skewered by your friends in cabin
five. Here-Chiron thought these would fit. You'll be on border patrol.''
My shield was the size of an NBA backboard, with a big caduceus in the middle. It weighed about
a million pounds. I could have snowboarded on it fine, but I hoped nobody seriously expected me to
run fast. My helmet, like all the helmets on Athena's side, had a blue horsehair plume on top. Ares
and their allies had red plumes.
Annabeth yelled, <div class="bookquote">``Blue team, forward!''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/>We cheered and shook our swords and followed her (<font color='blue'><b>Athena</b></font>) down the path to the south woods. The red
team yelled taunts at us as they headed off toward the north.
I managed to catch up with Annabeth without tripping over my equipment. <div class="bookquote">``Hey.''
 (<font color='red'><b>She</b></font>)</div>She (<font color='blue'><b>Athena</b></font>) kept marching.
<div class="bookquote">``So what's the plan?''  (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div>I asked. <div class="bookquote">``Got any magic items you can loan me?''
 (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>Her (<font color='blue'><b>Athena</b></font>) hand drifted toward her (<font color='blue'><b>Athena</b></font>) pocket, as if she (<font color='blue'><b>Athena</b></font>) were afraid I'd stolen something.
<div class="bookquote">``Just watch Clarisse's spear,''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Athena</b></font>) said. <div class="bookquote">``You don't want that thing touching you. Otherwise, don't
worry. We'll take the banner from Ares. Has Luke given you your job?''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``Border patrol, whatever that means.''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``It's easy. Stand by the creek, keep the reds away. Leave the rest to me. Athena always has a
plan.''
 (<font color='red'><b>She</b></font>)</div>She (<font color='blue'><b>Athena</b></font>) pushed ahead, leaving me in the dust.
<div class="bookquote">``Okay,''  (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div>I mumbled. <div class="bookquote">``Glad you wanted me on your team.''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>It was a warm, sticky night. The woods were dark, with fireflies popping in and out of view.
Annabeth stationed me next to a little creek that gurgled over some rocks, then she (<font color='blue'><b>Athena</b></font>) and the rest of the
team scattered into the trees.
Standing there alone, with my big blue-feathered helmet and my huge shield, I felt like an idiot.
The bronze sword, like all the swords I'd tried so far, seemed balanced wrong. The leather grip
pulled on my hand like a bowling ball.
There was no way anybody would actually attack me, would they? I mean, Olympus had to have
liability issues, right?
Far away, the conch horn blew. I heard whoops and yells in the woods, the clanking of metal, kids
fighting. A blue-plumed ally from Apollo raced past me like a deer, leaped through the creek, and
disappeared into enemy territory.
Great, I thought. I'll miss all the fun, as usual.
Then I heard a sound that sent a chill up my spine, a low canine growl, somewhere close by.
I raised my shield instinctively; I had the feeling something was stalking me.
Then the growling stopped. I felt the presence retreating.
On the other side of the creek, the underbrush exploded. Five Ares warriors came yelling and
screaming out of the dark.
<div class="bookquote">``Cream the punk!''  (<font color='red'><b>Clarisse</b></font>)</div>Clarisse screamed.
Her (<font color='blue'><b>Clarisse</b></font>) ugly pig eyes glared through the slits of her (<font color='blue'><b>Clarisse</b></font>) helmet. She (<font color='blue'><b>Clarisse</b></font>) brandished a five-foot-long spear, its
barbed metal tip flickering with red light. Her (<font color='blue'><b>Clarisse</b></font>) siblings had only the standard-issue bronze swords-not
that that made me feel any better.
They charged across the stream. There was no help in sight. I could run. Or I could defend myself
against half the Ares cabin.
I managed to sidestep the first kid's swing, but these guys were not as stupid the Minotaur. They
surrounded me, and Clarisse thrust at me with her (<font color='blue'><b>Clarisse</b></font>) spear. My shield deflected the point, but I felt a
painful tingling all over my body. My hair stood on end. My shield arm went numb, and the air
burned.
Electricity. Her (<font color='blue'><b>Clarisse</b></font>) stupid spear was electric. I fell back.
Another Ares guy slammed me in the chest with the butt of his (<font color='blue'><b>guy</b></font>) sword and I hit the dirt.
They could've kicked me into jelly, but they were too busy laughing.
<div class="bookquote">``Give him (<font color='blue'><b>Luke</b></font>) a haircut,''  (<font color='red'><b>Clarisse</b></font>)</div>Clarisse said. <div class="bookquote">``Grab his (<font color='blue'><b>Luke</b></font>) hair.''
 (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div>I managed to get to my feet. I raised my sword, but Clarisse slammed it aside with her (<font color='blue'><b>Clarisse</b></font>) spear as

<p/>sparks flew. Now both my arms felt numb.
<div class="bookquote">``Oh, wow,''  (<font color='red'><b>Clarisse</b></font>)</div>Clarisse said. <div class="bookquote">``I'm scared of this guy. Really scared.''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``The flag is that way,''  (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div>I told her (<font color='blue'><b>Clarisse</b></font>). I wanted to sound angry, but I was afraid it didn't come out that
way.
<div class="bookquote">``Yeah,''  (<font color='red'><b>siblings</b></font>)</div>one of her (<font color='blue'><b>Clarisse</b></font>) siblings said. <div class="bookquote">``But see, we don't care about the flag. We care about a guy who
made our cabin look stupid.''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``You do that without my help,''  (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div>I told them. It probably wasn't the smartest thing to say.
Two of them came at me. I backed up toward the creek, tried to raise my shield, but Clarisse was
too fast. Her (<font color='blue'><b>Clarisse</b></font>) spear stuck me straight in the ribs. If I hadn't been wearing an armored breastplate, I
would've been shish-ke-babbed. As it was, the electric point just about shocked my teeth out of my
mouth. One of her (<font color='blue'><b>Clarisse</b></font>) cabinmates slashed his (<font color='blue'><b>Clarisse</b></font>) sword across my arm, leaving a good-size cut.
Seeing my own blood made me dizzy-warm and cold at the same time.
<div class="bookquote">``No maiming,''  (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div>I managed to say.
<div class="bookquote">``Oops,''  (<font color='red'><b>the guy</b></font>)</div>the guy said. ``Guess I lost my dessert privilege.
He (<font color='blue'><b>guy</b></font>) pushed me into the creek and I landed with a splash. They all laughed. I figured as soon as
they were through being amused, I would die. But then something happened. The water seemed to
wake up my senses, as if I'd just had a bag of my mom's double-espresso jelly beans.
Clarisse and her (<font color='blue'><b>Clarisse</b></font>) cabinmates came into the creek to get me, but I stood to meet them. I knew what
to do. I swung the flat of my sword against the first guy's head and knocked his (<font color='blue'><b>guy</b></font>) helmet clean off. I hit
him (<font color='blue'><b>guy</b></font>) so hard I could see his (<font color='blue'><b>guy</b></font>) eyes vibrating as he (<font color='blue'><b>guy</b></font>) crumpled into the water.
Ugly Number Two and Ugly Number Three came at me. I slammed one in the face with my shield
and used my sword to shear off the other guy's horsehair plume. Both of them backed up quick. Ugly
Number Four didn't look really anxious to attack, but Clarisse kept coming, the point of her (<font color='blue'><b>Clarisse</b></font>) spear
crackling with energy. As soon as she (<font color='blue'><b>Clarisse</b></font>) thrust, I caught the shaft between the edge of my shield and my
sword, and I snapped it like a twig.
``Ah!'' she (<font color='blue'><b>Clarisse</b></font>) screamed. ``You idiot! You corpse-breath worm!''
She (<font color='blue'><b>Clarisse</b></font>) probably would've said worse, but I smacked her (<font color='blue'><b>Clarisse</b></font>) between the eyes with my sword-butt and
sent her (<font color='blue'><b>Clarisse</b></font>) stumbling backward out of the creek.
Then I heard yelling, elated screams, and I saw Luke racing toward the boundary line with the red
team's banner lifted high. He (<font color='blue'><b>Luke</b></font>) was flanked by a couple of Hermes guys covering his (<font color='blue'><b>Luke</b></font>) retreat, and a few
Apollos behind them, fighting off the Hephaestus kids. The Ares folks got up, and Clarisse muttered a
dazed curse.
``A trick!'' she (<font color='blue'><b>Clarisse</b></font>) shouted. ``It was a trick.''
They staggered after Luke, but it was too late. Everybody converged on the creek as Luke ran
across into friendly territory. Our side exploded into cheers. The red banner shimmered and turned to
silver. The boar and spear were replaced with a huge caduceus, the symbol of cabin eleven.
Everybody on the blue team picked up Luke and started carrying him (<font color='blue'><b>Luke</b></font>) around on their shoulders.
Chiron cantered out from the woods and blew the conch horn.
The game was over. We'd won.
I was about to join the celebration when Annabeth's voice, right next to me in the creek, said,
``Not bad, hero.''
I looked, but she (<font color='blue'><b>Everybody</b></font>) wasn't there.
``Where the heck did you learn to fight like that?'' she (<font color='blue'><b>Everybody</b></font>) asked. The air shimmered, and she (<font color='blue'><b>Everybody</b></font>)
materialized, holding a Yankees baseball cap as if she (<font color='blue'><b>Everybody</b></font>)'d just taken it off her (<font color='blue'><b>Everybody</b></font>) head.
I felt myself getting angry. I wasn't even fazed by the fact that she (<font color='blue'><b>Everybody</b></font>)'d just been invisible. ``You set

<p/>me up,'' I said. ``You put me here because you knew Clarisse would come after me, while you sent
Luke around the flank. You had it all figured out.''
Annabeth shrugged. ``I told you. Athena always, always has a plan.''
``A plan to get me pulverized.''
``I came as fast as I could. I was about to jump in, but ...'' She (<font color='blue'><b>Everybody</b></font>) shrugged. ``You didn't need help.''
Then she (<font color='blue'><b>Everybody</b></font>) noticed my wounded arm. ``How did you do that?''
``Sword cut,'' I said. ``What do you think?''
``No. It was a sword cut. Look at it.''
The blood was gone. Where the huge cut had been, there was a long white scratch, and even that
was fading. As I watched, it turned into a small scar, and disappeared.
``I-I don't get it,'' I said.
Annabeth was thinking hard. I could almost see the gears turning. She (<font color='blue'><b>Everybody</b></font>) looked down at my feet,
then at Clarisse's broken spear, and said, ``Step out of the water, Percy.''
``What-``
``Just do it.''
I came out of the creek and immediately felt bone tired. My arms started to go numb again. My
adrenaline rush left me. I almost fell over, but Annabeth steadied me.
``Oh, Styx,'' she (<font color='blue'><b>Clarisse</b></font>) cursed. ``This is not good. I didn't want ... I assumed it would be Zeus... .''
Before I could ask what she (<font color='blue'><b>Clarisse</b></font>) meant, I heard that canine growl again, but much closer than before.
A howl ripped through the forest.
The campers' cheering died instantly. Chiron shouted something in Ancient Greek, which I would
realize, only later, I had understood perfectly: ``Stand ready! My bow!''
Annabeth drew her (<font color='blue'><b>Clarisse</b></font>) sword.
There on the rocks just above us was a black hound the size of a rhino, with lava-red eyes and
fangs like daggers.
It was looking straight at me.
Nobody moved except Annabeth, who yelled, ``Percy, run!''
She (<font color='blue'><b>Clarisse</b></font>) tried to step in front of me, but the hound was too fast. It leaped over her-an enormous
shadow with teeth-and just as it hit me, as I stumbled backward and felt its razor-sharp claws ripping
through my armor, there was a cascade of thwacking sounds, like forty pieces of paper being ripped
one after the other. From the hounds neck sprouted a cluster of arrows. The monster fell dead at my
feet.
By some miracle, I was still alive. I didn't want to look underneath the ruins of my shredded
armor. My chest felt warm and wet, and I knew I was badly cut. Another second, and the monster
would've turned me into a hundred pounds of delicatessen meat.
Chiron trotted up next to us, a bow in his (<font color='blue'><b>my</b></font>) hand, his (<font color='blue'><b>my</b></font>) face grim.
``Di immortales!'' Annabeth said. ``That's a hellhound from the Fields of Punishment. They don't
... they're not supposed to ...''
``Someone summoned it,'' Chiron said. ``Someone inside the camp.''
Luke came over, the banner in his (<font color='blue'><b>Luke</b></font>) hand forgotten, his (<font color='blue'><b>Luke</b></font>) moment of glory gone.
Clarisse yelled, ``It's all Percy's fault! Percy summoned it!''
``Be quiet, child,'' Chiron told her (<font color='blue'><b>Clarisse</b></font>).
We watched the body of the hellhound melt into shadow, soaking into the ground until it
disappeared.
``You're wounded,'' Annabeth told me. <div class="bookquote">``Quick, Percy, get in the water.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I'm okay.''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``No, you're not,''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Clarisse</b></font>) said. <div class="bookquote">``Chiron, watch this.''
 (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div>I was too tired to argue. I stepped back into the creek, the whole camp gathering around me.
Instantly, I felt better. I could feel the cuts on my chest closing up. Some of the campers gasped.
<div class="bookquote">``Look, I-I don't know why,''  (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div>I said, trying to apologize. <div class="bookquote">``I'm sorry....''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>But they weren't watching my wounds heal. They were staring at something above my head.
<div class="bookquote">``Percy,''  (<font color='red'><b>Annabeth/ANNABETH</b></font>)</div>Annabeth said, pointing. <div class="bookquote">``Um ...''
 (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div>By the time I looked up, the sign was already fading, but I could still make out the hologram of
green light, spinning and gleaming. A three-tipped spear: a trident.
<div class="bookquote">``Your father,''  (<font color='red'><b>Annabeth/ANNABETH</b></font>)</div>Annabeth murmured. <div class="bookquote">``This is really not good.''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``It is determined,''  (<font color='red'><b>Chiron</b></font>)</div>Chiron announced.
All around me, campers started kneeling, even the Ares cabin, though they didn't look happy
about it.
<div class="bookquote">``My father?''  (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div>I asked, completely bewildered.
<div class="bookquote">``Poseidon,''  (<font color='red'><b>Chiron</b></font>)</div>said Chiron. <div class="bookquote">``Earthshaker, Stormbringer, Father of Horses. Hail, Perseus Jackson,
Son of the Sea God.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Percy/Percy Jackson/Jackson</b></font>)</div><p/>Percy Jackson 1 - The Lightning Thief
9 I AM OFFERED
A QUEST
The next morning, Chiron moved me to cabin three.
I didn't have to share with anybody. I had plenty of room for all my stuff: the Minotaur's horn, one
set of spare clothes, and a toiletry bag. I got to sit at my own dinner table, pick all my own activities,
call <div class="bookquote">``lights out''  (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div>whenever I felt like it, and not listen to anybody else.
And I was absolutely miserable.
Just when I'd started to feel accepted, to feel I had a home in cabin eleven and I might be a normal
kid-or as normal as you can be when you're a half-blood-I'd been separated out as if I had some rare
disease.
Nobody mentioned the hellhound, but I got the feeling they were all talking about it behind my
back. The attack had scared everybody. It sent two messages: one, that I was the son of the Sea God;
and two, monsters would stop at nothing to kill me. They could even invade a camp that had always
been considered safe.
The other campers steered clear of me as much as possible. Cabin eleven was too nervous to
have sword class with me after what I'd done to the Ares folks in the woods, so my lessons with Luke
became one-on-one. He (<font color='blue'><b>Luke</b></font>) pushed me harder than ever, and wasn't afraid to bruise me up in the process.
<div class="bookquote">``You're going to need all the training you can get,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Luke</b></font>) promised, as we were working with
swords and flaming torches. <div class="bookquote">``Now let's try that viper-beheading strike again. Fifty more repetitions.''
 (<font color='red'><b>Annabeth/ANNABETH</b></font>)</div>Annabeth still taught me Greek in the mornings, but she (<font color='blue'><b>Luke</b></font>) seemed distracted. Every time I said
something, she (<font color='blue'><b>Luke</b></font>) scowled at me, as if I'd just poked her (<font color='blue'><b>Luke</b></font>) between the eyes.
After lessons, she (<font color='blue'><b>Luke</b></font>) would walk away muttering to herself: <div class="bookquote">``Quest ... Poseidon? ... Dirty rotten ...
Got to make a plan ...''
 (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>Even Clarisse kept her (<font color='blue'><b>Clarisse</b></font>) distance, though her (<font color='blue'><b>Clarisse</b></font>) venomous looks made it clear she (<font color='blue'><b>Clarisse</b></font>) wanted to kill me
for breaking her (<font color='blue'><b>Clarisse</b></font>) magic spear. I wished she (<font color='blue'><b>Clarisse</b></font>) would just yell or punch me or something. I'd rather get
into fights every day than be ignored.
I knew somebody at camp resented me, because one night I came into my cabin and found a mortal
newspaper dropped inside the doorway, a copy of the New York Daily News, opened to the Metro
page. The article took me almost an hour to read, because the angrier I got, the more the words floated
around on the page.
BOY AND MOTHER STILL MISSING AFTER
FREAK CAR ACCIDENT
BY EILEEN SMYTHE
Sally Jackson and son Percy are still missing one week after their mysterious disappearance. The
family's badly burned `78 Camaro was discovered last Saturday on a north Long Island road with the
roof ripped off and the front axle broken. The car had flipped and skidded for several hundred feet
before exploding.
Mother and son had gone for a weekend vacation to Montauk, but left hastily, under mysterious
circumstances. Small traces of blood were found in the car and near the scene of the wreck, but there
were no other signs of the missing Jacksons. Residents in the rural area reported seeing nothing

<p/>unusual around the time of the accident.
Ms. Jackson's husband, Gabe Ugliano, claims that his (<font color='blue'><b>Ugliano</b></font>) stepson, Percy Jackson, is a troubled child
who has been kicked out of numerous boarding schools and has expressed violent tendencies in the
past.
Police would not say whether son Percy is a suspect in his (<font color='blue'><b>Percy</b></font>) mother's disappearance, but they have
not ruled out foul play. Below are recent pictures of Sally Jackson and Percy. Police urge anyone
with information to call the following toll-free crime-stoppers hotline.
The phone number was circled in black marker.
I wadded up the paper and threw it away, then flopped down in my bunk bed in the middle of my
empty cabin.
<div class="bookquote">``Lights out,''  (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div>I told myself miserably.
That night, I had my worst dream yet.
I was running along the beach in a storm. This time, there was a city behind me. Not New York.
The sprawl was different: buildings spread farther apart, palm trees and low hills in the distance.
About a hundred yards down the surf, two men were fighting. They looked like TV wrestlers,
muscular, with beards and long hair. Both wore flowing Greek tunics, one trimmed in blue, the other
in green. They grappled with each other, wrestled, kicked and head-butted, and every time they
connected, lightning flashed, the sky grew darker, and the wind rose.
I had to stop them. I didn't know why. But the harder I ran, the more the wind blew me back, until
I was running in place, my heels digging uselessly in the sand.
Over the roar of the storm, I could hear the blue-robed one yelling at the green-robed one, Give it
back! Give it back! Like a kindergartner fighting over a toy.
The waves got bigger, crashing into the beach, spraying me with salt.
I yelled, Stop it! Stop fighting!
The ground shook. Laughter came from somewhere under the earth, and a voice so deep and evil
it turned my blood to ice.
Come down, little hero, the voice crooned. Come down!
The sand split beneath me, opening up a crevice straight down to the center of the earth. My feet
slipped, and darkness swallowed me.
I woke up, sure I was falling.
I was still in bed in cabin three. My body told me it was morning, but it was dark outside, and
thunder rolled across the hills. A storm was brewing. I hadn't dreamed that.
I heard a clopping sound at the door, a hoof knocking on the threshold.
<div class="bookquote">``Come in?''
 (<font color='red'><b>Grover/Grover Underwood/GROVER</b></font>)</div>Grover trotted inside, looking worried. <div class="bookquote">``Mr. D wants to see you.''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``Why?''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``He (<font color='blue'><b>Mr.</b></font>) wants to kill... I mean, I'd better let him (<font color='blue'><b>Mr.</b></font>) tell you.''
 (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div>Nervously, I got dressed and followed, sure that I was in huge trouble.
For days, I'd been half expecting a summons to the Big House. Now that I was declared a son of
Poseidon, one of the Big Three gods who weren't supposed to have kids, I figured it was a crime for
me just to be alive. The other gods had probably been debating the best way to punish me for existing,
and now Mr. D was ready to deliver their verdict.
Over Long Island Sound, the sky looked like ink soup coming to a boil. A hazy curtain of rain was
coming in our direction. I asked Grover if we needed an umbrella.
<div class="bookquote">``No,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Grover</b></font>) said. <div class="bookquote">``It never rains here unless we want it to.''

 (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div><p/>I pointed at the storm. <div class="bookquote">``What the heck is that, then?''
 (<font color='red'><b>He</b></font>)</div>He (<font color='blue'><b>Grover</b></font>) glanced uneasily at the sky. <div class="bookquote">``It'll pass around us. Bad weather always does.''
 (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div>I realized he (<font color='blue'><b>Grover</b></font>) was right. In the week I'd been here, it had never even been overcast. The few rain
clouds I'd seen had skirted right around the edges of the valley.
But this storm ... this one was huge.
At the volleyball pit, the kids from Apollo's cabin were playing a morning game against the
satyrs. Dionysus's twins were walking around in the strawberry fields, making the plants grow.
Everybody was going about their normal business, but they looked tense. They kept their eyes on the
storm.
Grover and I walked up to the front porch of the Big House. Dionysus sat at the pinochle table in
his (<font color='blue'><b>Grover</b></font>) tiger-striped Hawaiian shirt with his (<font color='blue'><b>Grover</b></font>) Diet Coke, just as he (<font color='blue'><b>Grover</b></font>) had on my first day. Chiron sat across
the table in his (<font color='blue'><b>Grover</b></font>) fake wheelchair. They were playing against invisible opponents--two sets of cards
hovering in the air.
<div class="bookquote">``Well, well,''  (<font color='red'><b>Mr. D</b></font>)</div>Mr. D said without looking up. <div class="bookquote">``Our little celebrity.''
 (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div>I waited.
<div class="bookquote">``Come closer,''  (<font color='red'><b>Mr. D</b></font>)</div>Mr. D said. <div class="bookquote">``And don't expect me to kowtow to you, mortal, just because old
Barnacle-Beard is your father.''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>A net of lightning flashed across the clouds. Thunder shook the windows of the house.
<div class="bookquote">``Blah, blah, blah,''  (<font color='red'><b>Dionysus</b></font>)</div>Dionysus said.
Chiron feigned interest in his (<font color='blue'><b>D</b></font>) pinochle cards. Grover cowered by the railing, his (<font color='blue'><b>Grover</b></font>) hooves clopping
back and forth.
<div class="bookquote">``If I had my way,''  (<font color='red'><b>Dionysus</b></font>)</div>Dionysus said, <div class="bookquote">``I would cause your molecules to erupt in flames. We'd sweep
up the ashes and be done with a lot of trouble. But Chiron seems to feel this would be against my
mission at this cursed camp: to keep you little brats safe from harm.''
 (<font color='red'><b>Dionysus</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``Spontaneous combustion is a form of harm, Mr. D,''  (<font color='red'><b>Chiron</b></font>)</div>Chiron put in.
<div class="bookquote">``Nonsense,''  (<font color='red'><b>Dionysus</b></font>)</div>Dionysus said. <div class="bookquote">``Boy wouldn't feel a thing. Nevertheless, I've agreed to restrain
myself I'm thinking of turning you into a dolphin instead, sending you back to your father.''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``Mr. D-''  (<font color='red'><b>Chiron</b></font>)</div>Chiron warned.
<div class="bookquote">``Oh, all right,''  (<font color='red'><b>Dionysus</b></font>)</div>Dionysus relented. <div class="bookquote">``There's one more option. But it's deadly foolishness.''
 (<font color='red'><b>Dionysus</b></font>)</div>Dionysus rose, and the invisible players' cards dropped to the table. <div class="bookquote">``I'm off to Olympus for the
emergency meeting. If the boy is still here when I get back, I'll turn him (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>) into an Atlantic bottlenose.
Do you understand? And Perseus Jackson, if you're at all smart, you'll see that's a much more
sensible choice than what Chiron feels you must do.''
 (<font color='red'><b>Dionysus</b></font>)</div>Dionysus picked up a playing card, twisted it, and it became a plastic rectangle. A credit card?
No. A security pass.
He (<font color='blue'><b>Grover</b></font>) snapped his (<font color='blue'><b>Grover</b></font>) fingers.
The air seemed to fold and bend around him (<font color='blue'><b>Grover</b></font>). He (<font color='blue'><b>Grover</b></font>) became a hologram, then a wind, then he (<font color='blue'><b>Grover</b></font>) was
gone, leaving only the smell of fresh-pressed grapes lingering behind.
Chiron smiled at me, but he (<font color='blue'><b>Grover</b></font>) looked tired and strained. <div class="bookquote">``Sit, Percy, please. And Grover.''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>We did.
Chiron laid his (<font color='blue'><b>Grover</b></font>) cards on the table, a winning hand he (<font color='blue'><b>Grover</b></font>) hadn't gotten to use.
<div class="bookquote">``Tell me, Percy,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Grover</b></font>) said. <div class="bookquote">``What did you make of the hellhound?''
 (<font color='red'><b>me</b></font>)</div>Just hearing the name made me shudder.
Chiron probably wanted me to say, Heck, it was nothing. I eat hellhounds for breakfast. But I
didn't feel like lying.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``It scared me,''  (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div>I said. <div class="bookquote">``If you hadn't shot it, I'd be dead.''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``You'll meet worse, Percy. Far worse, before you're done.''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``Done ... with what?''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``Your quest, of course. Will you accept it?''
 (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div>I glanced at Grover, who was crossing his (<font color='blue'><b>Grover</b></font>) fingers.
<div class="bookquote">``Um, sir,''  (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div>I said, <div class="bookquote">``you haven't told me what it is yet.''
 (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div>Chiron grimaced. <div class="bookquote">``Well, that's the hard part, the details.''
 (<font color='red'><b>Thunder</b></font>)</div>Thunder rumbled across the valley. The storm clouds had now reached the edge of the beach. As
far as I could see, the sky and the sea were boiling together.
<div class="bookquote">``Poseidon and Zeus,''  (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div>I said. <div class="bookquote">``They're fighting over something valuable ... something that was
stolen, aren't they?''
 (<font color='red'><b>Chiron</b></font>)</div>Chiron and Grover exchanged looks.
Chiron sat forward in his (<font color='blue'><b>Grover</b></font>) wheelchair. <div class="bookquote">``How did you know that?''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>My face felt hot. I wished I hadn't opened my big mouth. <div class="bookquote">``The weather since Christmas has been
weird, like the sea and the sky are fighting. Then I talked to Annabeth, and she (<font color='blue'><b>I</b></font>)'d overheard something
about a theft. And ... I've also been having these dreams.''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``I knew it,''  (<font color='red'><b>Grover/Grover Underwood/GROVER</b></font>)</div>Grover said.
<div class="bookquote">``Hush, satyr,''  (<font color='red'><b>Chiron</b></font>)</div>Chiron ordered.
<div class="bookquote">``But it is his (<font color='blue'><b>Zeus</b></font>) quest!''  (<font color='red'><b>Grover/Grover Underwood/GROVER</b></font>)</div>Grover's eyes were bright with excitement. <div class="bookquote">``It must be!''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``Only the Oracle can determine.''  (<font color='red'><b>Chiron</b></font>)</div>Chiron stroked his (<font color='blue'><b>Grover</b></font>) bristly beard. <div class="bookquote">``Nevertheless, Percy, you are
correct. Your father and Zeus are having their worst quarrel in centuries. They are fighting over
something valuable that was stolen. To be precise: a lightning bolt.''
 (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div>I laughed nervously. <div class="bookquote">``A what?''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``Do not take this lightly,''  (<font color='red'><b>Chiron</b></font>)</div>Chiron warned. <div class="bookquote">``I'm not talking about some tinfoil-covered zigzag
you'd see in a second-grade play. I'm talking about a two-foot-long cylinder of high-grade celestial
bronze, capped on both ends with god-level explosives.''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``Oh.''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``Zeus's master bolt,''  (<font color='red'><b>Chiron</b></font>)</div>Chiron said, getting worked up now. <div class="bookquote">``The symbol of his (<font color='blue'><b>Zeus</b></font>) power, from which
all other lightning bolts are patterned. The first weapon made by the Cyclopes for the war against the
Titans, the bolt that sheered the top off Mount Etna and hurled Kronos from his (<font color='blue'><b>Zeus</b></font>) throne; the master bolt,
which packs enough power to make mortal hydrogen bombs look like firecrackers.''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``And it's missing?''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``Stolen,''  (<font color='red'><b>Chiron</b></font>)</div>Chiron said.
<div class="bookquote">``By who?''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``By whom,''  (<font color='red'><b>Chiron</b></font>)</div>Chiron corrected. Once a teacher, always a teacher. <div class="bookquote">``By you.''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>My mouth fell open.
<div class="bookquote">``At least'' (<font color='red'><b>Chiron</b></font>)</div>-Chiron held up a hand-<div class="bookquote">``that's what Zeus thinks. During the winter solstice, at the last
council of the gods, Zeus and Poseidon had an argument. The usual nonsense: `Mother Rhea always
liked you best,' Air disasters are more spectacular than sea disasters,' et cetera. Afterward, Zeus
realized his (<font color='blue'><b>Zeus</b></font>) master bolt was missing, taken from the throne room under his (<font color='blue'><b>Zeus</b></font>) very nose. He (<font color='blue'><b>Zeus</b></font>) immediately
blamed Poseidon. Now, a god cannot usurp another god's symbol of power directly-that is forbidden
by the most ancient of divine laws. But Zeus believes your father convinced a human hero to take it.''
 (<font color='red'><b>Chiron</b></font>)</div>``But I didn't-``
<div class="bookquote">``Patience and listen, child,''  (<font color='red'><b>Chiron</b></font>)</div>Chiron said. ``Zeus has good reason to be suspicious. The forges of
the Cyclopes are under the ocean, which gives Poseidon some influence over the makers of his (<font color='blue'><b>Zeus</b></font>)

<p/>brother's lightning. Zeus believes Poseidon has taken the master bolt, and is now secretly having the
Cyclopes build an arsenal of illegal copies, which might be used to topple Zeus from his (<font color='blue'><b>Zeus</b></font>) throne. The
only thing Zeus wasn't sure about was which hero Poseidon used to steal the bolt. Now Poseidon has
openly claimed you as his (<font color='blue'><b>Zeus</b></font>) son. You were in New York over the winter holidays. You could easily
have snuck into Olympus. Zeus believes he (<font color='blue'><b>Zeus</b></font>) has found his (<font color='blue'><b>Zeus</b></font>) thief.''
``But I've never even been to Olympus! Zeus is crazy!''
Chiron and Grover glanced nervously at the sky. The clouds didn't seem to be parting around us,
as Grover had promised. They were rolling straight over our valley, sealing us in like a coffin lid.
``Er, Percy ...?'' Grover said. ``We don't use the c-word to describe the Lord of the Sky.''
``Perhaps paranoid,'' Chiron suggested. ``Then again, Poseidon has tried to unseat Zeus before. I
believe that was question thirty-eight on your final exam....'' He (<font color='blue'><b>Grover</b></font>) looked at me as if he (<font color='blue'><b>Grover</b></font>) actually
expected me to remember question thirty-eight.
How could anyone accuse me of stealing a god's weapon? I couldn't even steal a slice of pizza
from Gabe's poker party without getting busted. Chiron was waiting for an answer.
``Something about a golden net?'' I guessed. ``Poseidon and Hera and a few other gods ... they,
like, trapped Zeus and wouldn't let him (<font color='blue'><b>Zeus</b></font>) out until he (<font color='blue'><b>Zeus</b></font>) promised to be a better ruler, right?''
``Correct,'' Chiron said. ``And Zeus has never trusted Poseidon since. Of course, Poseidon denies
stealing the master bolt. He (<font color='blue'><b>Zeus</b></font>) took great offense at the accusation. The two have been arguing back and
forth for months, threatening war. And now, you've come along-the proverbial last straw.''
``But I'm just a kid!''
``Percy,'' Grover cut in, ``if you were Zeus, and you already thought your brother was plotting to
overthrow you, then your brother suddenly admitted he (<font color='blue'><b>Zeus</b></font>) had broken the sacred oath he (<font color='blue'><b>Zeus</b></font>) took after
World War II, that he (<font color='blue'><b>Zeus</b></font>)'s fathered a new mortal hero who might be used as a weapon against you....
Wouldn't that put a twist in your toga?''
``But I didn't do anything. Poseidon-my dad-he didn't really have this master bolt stolen, did he (<font color='blue'><b>master</b></font>)?''
Chiron sighed. ``Most thinking observers would agree that thievery is not Poseidon's style. But the
Sea God is too proud to try convincing Zeus of that. Zeus has demanded that Poseidon return the bolt
by the summer solstice. That's June twenty-first, ten days from now. Poseidon wants an apology for
being called a thief by the same date. I hoped that diplomacy might prevail, that Hera or Demeter or
Hestia would make the two brothers see sense. But your arrival has inflamed Zeus's temper. Now
neither god will back down. Unless someone intervenes, unless the master bolt is found and returned
to Zeus before the solstice, there will be war. And do you know what a full-fledged war would look
like, Percy?''
``Bad?'' I guessed.
``Imagine the world in chaos. Nature at war with itself. Olympians forced to choose sides between
Zeus and Poseidon. Destruction. Carnage. Millions dead. Western civilization turned into a
battleground so big it will make the Trojan War look like a water-balloon fight.''
``Bad,'' I repeated.
``And you, Percy Jackson, would be the first to feel Zeus's wrath.''
It started to rain. Volleyball players stopped their game and stared in stunned silence at the sky.
I had brought this storm to Half-Blood Hill. Zeus was punishing the whole camp because of me. I
was furious.
``So I have to find the stupid bolt,'' I said. ``And return it to Zeus.''
``What better peace offering,'' Chiron said, <div class="bookquote">``than to have the son of Poseidon return Zeus's
property?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``If Poseidon doesn't have it, where is the thing?''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``I believe I know.''  (<font color='red'><b>Chiron</b></font>)</div>Chiron's expression was grim. <div class="bookquote">``Part of a prophecy I had years ago ... well,
some of the lines make sense to me, now. But before I can say more, you must officially take up the
quest. You must seek the counsel of the Oracle.''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``Why can't you tell me where the bolt is beforehand?''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``Because if I did, you would be too afraid to accept the challenge.''
 (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div>I swallowed. <div class="bookquote">``Good reason.''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``You agree then?''
 (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div>I looked at Grover, who nodded encouragingly.
Easy for him (<font color='blue'><b>Grover</b></font>). I was the one Zeus wanted to kill.
<div class="bookquote">``All right,''  (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div>I said. <div class="bookquote">``It's better than being turned into a dolphin.''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``Then it's time you consulted the Oracle,''  (<font color='red'><b>Chiron</b></font>)</div>Chiron said. <div class="bookquote">``Go upstairs, Percy Jackson, to the attic.
When you come back down, assuming you're still sane, we will talk more.''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>Four flights up, the stairs ended under a green trapdoor.
I pulled the cord. The door swung down, and a wooden ladder clattered into place.
The warm air from above smelled like mildew and rotten wood and something else ... a smell I
remembered from biology class. Reptiles. The smell of snakes.
I held my breath and climbed.
The attic was filled with Greek hero junk: armor stands covered in cobwebs; once-bright shields
pitted with rust; old leather steamer trunks plastered with stickers saying ITHAKA, CIRCE'S ISLE,
and LAND OF THE AMAZONS. One long table was stacked with glass jars filled with pickled
things-severed hairy claws, huge yellow eyes, various other parts of monsters. A dusty mounted
trophy on the wall looked like a giant snake's head, but with horns and a full set of shark's teeth. The
plaque read, HYDRA HEAD #1, WOODSTOCK, N.Y., 1969.
By the window, sitting on a wooden tripod stool, was the most gruesome memento of all: a
mummy. Not the wrapped-in-cloth kind, but a human female body shriveled to a husk. She (<font color='blue'><b>monsters</b></font>) wore a tiedyed sundress, lots of beaded necklaces, and a headband over long black hair. The skin of her (<font color='blue'><b>monsters</b></font>) face
was thin and leathery over her (<font color='blue'><b>monsters</b></font>) skull, and her (<font color='blue'><b>monsters</b></font>) eyes were glassy white slits, as if the real eyes had been
replaced by marbles; she (<font color='blue'><b>monsters</b></font>)'d been dead a long, long time.
Looking at her (<font color='blue'><b>monsters</b></font>) sent chills up my back. And that was before she (<font color='blue'><b>monsters</b></font>) sat up on her (<font color='blue'><b>monsters</b></font>) stool and opened her (<font color='blue'><b>monsters</b></font>)
mouth. A green mist poured from the mummy's mouth, coiling over the floor in thick tendrils, hissing
like twenty thousand snakes. I stumbled over myself trying to get to the trapdoor, but it slammed shut.
Inside my head, I heard a voice, slithering into one ear and coiling around my brain: I am the spirit of
Delphi, speaker of the prophecies of Phoebus Apollo, slayer of the mighty Python. Approach, seeker,
and ask.
I wanted to say, No thanks, wrong door, just looking for the bathroom. But I forced myself to take
a deep breath.
The mummy wasn't alive. She (<font color='blue'><b>I</b></font>) was some kind of gruesome receptacle for something else, the
power that was now swirling around me in the green mist. But its presence didn't feel evil, like my
demonic math teacher Mrs. Dodds or the Minotaur. It felt more like the Three Fates I'd seen knitting
the yarn outside the highway fruit stand: ancient, powerful, and definitely not human. But not
particularly interested in killing me, either.
I got up the courage to ask, <div class="bookquote">``What is my destiny?''
 (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div>The mist swirled more thickly, collecting right in front of me and around the table with the pickled
monster-part jars. Suddenly there were four men sitting around the table, playing cards. Their faces

<p/>became clearer. It was Smelly Gabe and his (<font color='blue'><b>Gabe</b></font>) buddies.
My fists clenched, though I knew this poker party couldn't be real. It was an illusion, made out of
mist.
Gabe turned toward me and spoke in the rasping voice of the Oracle: You shall go west, and face
the god who has turned.
His (<font color='blue'><b>god</b></font>) buddy on the right looked up and said in the same voice: You shall find what was stolen, and
see it safely returned.
The guy on the left threw in two poker chips, then said: You shall he (<font color='blue'><b>guy</b></font>) betrayed by one who calls
you a friend.
Finally, Eddie, our building super, delivered the worst line of all: And you shall fail to save what
matters most, in the end.
The figures began to dissolve. At first I was too stunned to say anything, but as the mist retreated,
coiling into a huge green serpent and slithering back into the mouth of the mummy, I cried, <div class="bookquote">``Wait!
What do you mean? What friend? What will I fail to save?''
 (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div>The tail of the mist snake disappeared into the mummy's mouth. She (<font color='blue'><b>you</b></font>) reclined back against the
wall. Her (<font color='blue'><b>you</b></font>) mouth closed tight, as if it hadn't been open in a hundred years. The attic was silent again,
abandoned, nothing but a room full of mementos.
I got the feeling that I could stand here until I had cobwebs, too, and I wouldn't learn anything
else.
My audience with the Oracle was over.
<div class="bookquote">``Well?''  (<font color='red'><b>Chiron</b></font>)</div>Chiron asked me.
I slumped into a chair at the pinochle table. <div class="bookquote">``She (<font color='blue'><b>you</b></font>) said I would retrieve what was stolen.''
 (<font color='red'><b>Grover/Grover Underwood/GROVER</b></font>)</div>Grover sat forward, chewing excitedly on the remains of a Diet Coke can. <div class="bookquote">``That's great!''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``What did the Oracle say exactly?''  (<font color='red'><b>Chiron</b></font>)</div>Chiron pressed. <div class="bookquote">``This is important.''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>My ears were still tingling from the reptilian voice. <div class="bookquote">``She (<font color='blue'><b>you</b></font>) . .. she (<font color='blue'><b>you</b></font>) said I would go west and face a
god who had turned. I would retrieve what was stolen and see it safely returned.''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``I knew it,''  (<font color='red'><b>Grover/Grover Underwood/GROVER</b></font>)</div>Grover said.
Chiron didn't look satisfied. <div class="bookquote">``Anything else?''
 (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div>I didn't want to tell him (<font color='blue'><b>Grover</b></font>).
What friend would betray me? I didn't have that many.
And the last line-I would fail to save what mattered most. What kind of Oracle would send me on
a quest and tell me, Oh, by the way, you'll fail
How could I confess that?
<div class="bookquote">``No,''  (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div>I said. <div class="bookquote">``That's about it.''
 (<font color='red'><b>He</b></font>)</div>He (<font color='blue'><b>friend</b></font>) studied my face. <div class="bookquote">``Very well, Percy. But know this: the Oracle's words often have double
meanings. Don't dwell on them too much. The truth is not always clear until events come to pass.''
 (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div>I got the feeling he (<font color='blue'><b>friend</b></font>) knew I was holding back something bad, and he (<font color='blue'><b>friend</b></font>) was trying to make me feel
better.
<div class="bookquote">``Okay,''  (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div>I said, anxious to change topics. <div class="bookquote">``So where do I go? Who's this god in the west?''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``Ah, think, Percy,''  (<font color='red'><b>Chiron</b></font>)</div>Chiron said. <div class="bookquote">``If Zeus and Poseidon weaken each other in a war, who stands to
gain?''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``Somebody else who wants to take over?''  (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div>I guessed.
``Yes, quite. Someone who harbors a grudge, who has been unhappy with his (<font color='blue'><b>Zeus</b></font>) lot since the world
was divided eons ago, whose kingdom would grow powerful with the deaths of millions. Someone
who hates his (<font color='blue'><b>Zeus</b></font>) brothers for forcing him (<font color='blue'><b>Zeus</b></font>) into an oath to have no more children, an oath that both of them

<p/>have now broken.''
I thought about my dreams, the evil voice that had spoken from under the ground. ``Hades.''
Chiron nodded. ``The Lord of the Dead is the only possibility.''
A scrap of aluminum dribbled out of Grover's mouth. ``Whoa, wait. Wh-what?''
``A Fury came after Percy,'' Chiron reminded him (<font color='blue'><b>Grover</b></font>). ``She (<font color='blue'><b>Zeus</b></font>) watched the young man until she (<font color='blue'><b>Zeus</b></font>) was sure
of his (<font color='blue'><b>Percy</b></font>) identity, then tried to kill him (<font color='blue'><b>Percy</b></font>). Furies obey only one lord: Hades.''
``Yes, but-but Hades hates all heroes,'' Grover protested. ``Especially if he (<font color='blue'><b>Percy</b></font>) has found out Percy is
a son of Poseidon... .''
``A hellhound got into the forest,'' Chiron continued. ``Those can only be summoned from the
Fields of Punishment, and it had to be summoned by someone within the camp. Hades must have a spy
here. He (<font color='blue'><b>spy</b></font>) must suspect Poseidon will try to use Percy to clear his (<font color='blue'><b>Percy</b></font>) name. Hades would very much like
to kill this young half-blood before he (<font color='blue'><b>Percy</b></font>) can take on the quest.''
``Great,'' I muttered. ``That's two major gods who want to kill me.''
``But a quest to ...'' Grover swallowed. ``I mean, couldn't the master bolt be in some place like
Maine? Maine's very nice this time of year.''
``Hades sent a minion to steal the master bolt,'' Chiron insisted. ``He (<font color='blue'><b>master</b></font>) hid it in the Underworld,
knowing full well that Zeus would blame Poseidon. I don't pretend to understand the Lord of the
Dead's motives perfectly, or why he (<font color='blue'><b>Zeus</b></font>) chose this time to start a war, but one thing is certain. Percy must
go to the Underworld, find the master bolt, and reveal the truth.''
A strange fire burned in my stomach. The weirdest thing was: it wasn't fear. It was anticipation.
The desire for revenge. Hades had tried to kill me three times so far, with the Fury, the Minotaur, and
the hellhound. It was his (<font color='blue'><b>Grover</b></font>) fault my mother had disappeared in a flash of light. Now he (<font color='blue'><b>Grover</b></font>) was trying to
frame me and my dad for a theft we hadn't committed.
I was ready to take him (<font color='blue'><b>Grover</b></font>) on.
Besides, if my mother was in the Underworld ...
Whoa, boy, said the small part of my brain that was still sane. You're a kid. Hades is a god.
Grover was trembling. He (<font color='blue'><b>Grover</b></font>)'d started eating pinochle cards like potato chips.
The poor guy needed to complete a quest with me so he (<font color='blue'><b>Grover</b></font>) could get his (<font color='blue'><b>Grover</b></font>) searcher's license, whatever
that was, but how could I ask him (<font color='blue'><b>Grover</b></font>) to do this quest, especially when the Oracle said I was destined to
fail? This was suicide.
``Look, if we know it's Hades,'' I told Chiron, ``why can't we just tell the other gods? Zeus or
Poseidon could go down to the Underworld and bust some heads.''
``Suspecting and knowing are not the same,'' Chiron said. ``Besides, even if the other gods suspect
Hades-and I imagine Poseidon does-they couldn't retrieve the bolt themselves. Gods cannot cross
each other's territories except by invitation. That is another ancient rule. Heroes, on the other hand,
have certain privileges. They can go anywhere, challenge anyone, as long as they're bold enough and
strong enough to do it. No god can be held responsible for a hero's actions. Why do you think the
gods always operate through humans?''
``You're saying I'm being used.''
<div class="bookquote">``I'm saying it's no accident Poseidon has claimed you now. It's a very risky gamble, but he (<font color='blue'><b>god</b></font>)'s in a
desperate situation. He (<font color='blue'><b>god</b></font>) needs you.''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>My dad needs me.
Emotions rolled around inside me like bits of glass in a kaleidoscope. I didn't know whether to
feel resentful or grateful or happy or angry. Poseidon had ignored me for twelve years. Now suddenly
he (<font color='blue'><b>dad</b></font>) needed me.

<p/>I looked at Chiron. <div class="bookquote">``You've known I was Poseidon's son all along, haven't you?''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``I had my suspicions. As I said ... I've spoken to the Oracle, too.''
 (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div>I got the feeling there was a lot he (<font color='blue'><b>dad</b></font>) wasn't telling me about his (<font color='blue'><b>dad</b></font>) prophecy, but I decided I couldn't
worry about that right now. After all, I was holding back information too.
<div class="bookquote">``So let me get this straight,''  (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div>I said. <div class="bookquote">``I'm supposed go to the Underworld and confront the Lord of
the Dead.''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``Check,''  (<font color='red'><b>Chiron</b></font>)</div>Chiron said.
<div class="bookquote">``Find the most powerful weapon in the universe.''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``Check.''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``And get it back to Olympus before the summer solstice, in ten days.''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``That's about right.''
 (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div>I looked at Grover, who gulped down the ace of hearts.
<div class="bookquote">``Did I mention that Maine is very nice this time of year?''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Grover</b></font>) asked weakly.
<div class="bookquote">``You don't have to go,''  (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div>I told him (<font color='blue'><b>Grover</b></font>). ``I can't ask that of you.
``Oh ...'' He (<font color='blue'><b>Grover</b></font>) shifted his (<font color='blue'><b>Grover</b></font>) hooves. ``No ... it's just that satyrs and underground places ... well...''
He (<font color='blue'><b>Grover</b></font>) took a deep breath, then stood, brushing the shredded cards and aluminum bits off his (<font color='blue'><b>Grover</b></font>) T-shirt.
``You saved my life, Percy. If ... if you're serious about wanting me along, I won't let you down.''
I felt so relieved I wanted to cry, though I didn't think that would be very heroic. Grover was the
only friend I'd ever had for longer than a few months. I wasn't sure what good a satyr could do
against the forces of the dead, but I felt better knowing he (<font color='blue'><b>Grover</b></font>)'d be with me.
``All the way, G-man.'' I turned to Chiron. ``So where do we go? The Oracle just said to go west.''
``The entrance to the Underworld is always in the west. It moves from age to age, just like
Olympus. Right now, of course, it's in America.''
``Where?''
Chiron looked surprised. ``I thought that would be obvious enough. The entrance to the
Underworld is in Los Angeles.''
``Oh,'' I said. ``Naturally. So we just get on a plane-``
``No!'' Grover shrieked. ``Percy, what are you thinking? Have you ever been on a plane in your
life?''
I shook my head, feeling embarrassed. My mom had never taken me anywhere by plane. She (<font color='blue'><b>mom</b></font>)'d
always said we didn't have the money. Besides, her (<font color='blue'><b>mom</b></font>) parents had died in a plane crash.
``Percy, think,'' Chiron said. ``You are the son of the Sea God. Your father's bitterest rival is Zeus,
Lord of the Sky. Your mother knew better than to trust you in an airplane. You would be in Zeus's
domain. You would never come down again alive.''
Overhead, lightning crackled. Thunder boomed.
``Okay,'' I said, determined not to look at the storm. ``So, I'll travel overland.''
``That's right,'' Chiron said. ``Two companions may accompany you. Grover is one. The other has
already volunteered, if you will accept her (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) help.''
``Gee,'' I said, feigning surprise. ``Who else would be stupid enough to volunteer for a quest like
this?''
The air shimmered behind Chiron.
Annabeth became visible, stuffing her (<font color='blue'><b>mom</b></font>) Yankees cap into her (<font color='blue'><b>mom</b></font>) back pocket.
``I've been waiting a long time for a quest, seaweed brain,'' she (<font color='blue'><b>mom</b></font>) said. ``Athena is no fan of
Poseidon, but if you're going to save the world, I'm the best person to keep you from messing up.''
``If you do say so yourself,'' I said. <div class="bookquote">``I suppose you have a plan, wise girl?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/>Her (<font color='blue'><b>mom</b></font>) cheeks colored. <div class="bookquote">``Do you want my help or not?''
 (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div>The truth was, I did. I needed all the help I could get.
<div class="bookquote">``A trio,''  (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div>I said. <div class="bookquote">``That'll work.''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``Excellent,''  (<font color='red'><b>Chiron</b></font>)</div>Chiron said. <div class="bookquote">``This afternoon, we can take you as far as the bus terminal in
Manhattan. After that, you are on your own.''
 (<font color='red'><b>Lightning</b></font>)</div>Lightning flashed. Rain poured down on the meadows that were never supposed to have violent
weather.
<div class="bookquote">``No time to waste,''  (<font color='red'><b>Chiron</b></font>)</div>Chiron said. <div class="bookquote">``I think you should all get packing.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Percy/Percy Jackson/Jackson</b></font>)</div><p/>Percy Jackson 1 - The Lightning Thief
10 I RUIN A PERFECTLY
GOOD BUS
It didn't take me long to pack. I decided to leave the Minotaur horn in my cabin, which left me
only an extra change of clothes and a toothbrush to stuff in a backpack Grover had found for me.
The camp store loaned me one hundred dollars in mortal money and twenty golden drachmas.
These coins were as big as Girl Scout cookies and had images of various Greek gods stamped on one
side and the Empire State Building on the other. The ancient mortal drachmas had been silver, Chiron
told us, but Olympians never used less than pure gold. Chiron said the coins might come in handy for
non-mortal transactions-whatever that meant. He (<font color='blue'><b>Scout</b></font>) gave Annabeth and me each a canteen of nectar and
a Ziploc bag full of ambrosia squares, to be used only in emergencies, if we were seriously hurt. It
was god food, Chiron reminded us. It would cure us of almost any injury, but it was lethal to mortals.
Too much of it would make a half-blood very, very feverish. An overdose would burn us up, literally.
Annabeth was bringing her (<font color='blue'><b>Annabeth</b></font>) magic Yankees cap, which she (<font color='blue'><b>Annabeth</b></font>) told me had been a twelfth-birthday
present from her (<font color='blue'><b>Annabeth</b></font>) mom. She (<font color='blue'><b>Annabeth</b></font>) carried a book on famous classical architecture, written in Ancient Greek,
to read when she (<font color='blue'><b>Annabeth</b></font>) got bored, and a long bronze knife, hidden in her (<font color='blue'><b>Annabeth</b></font>) shirt sleeve. I was sure the knife
would get us busted the first time we went through a metal detector.
Grover wore his (<font color='blue'><b>Grover</b></font>) fake feet and his (<font color='blue'><b>Grover</b></font>) pants to pass as human. He (<font color='blue'><b>Grover</b></font>) wore a green rasta-style cap,
because when it rained his (<font color='blue'><b>Grover</b></font>) curly hair flattened and you could just see the tips of his (<font color='blue'><b>Grover</b></font>) horns. His (<font color='blue'><b>Grover</b></font>) bright
orange backpack was full of scrap metal and apples to snack on. In his (<font color='blue'><b>Grover</b></font>) pocket was a set of reed pipes
his (<font color='blue'><b>Grover</b></font>) daddy goat had carved for him (<font color='blue'><b>Grover</b></font>), even though he (<font color='blue'><b>Grover</b></font>) only knew two songs: Mozart's Piano Concerto no.
12 and Hilary Duff's <div class="bookquote">``So Yesterday,''  (<font color='red'><b>Hilary Duff</b></font>)</div>both of which sounded pretty bad on reed pipes.
We waved good-bye to the other campers, took one last look at the strawberry fields, the ocean,
and the Big House, then hiked up Half-Blood Hill to the tall pine tree that used to be Thalia, daughter
of Zeus.
Chiron was waiting for us in his (<font color='blue'><b>Zeus</b></font>) wheelchair. Next to him (<font color='blue'><b>Zeus</b></font>) stood the surfer dude I'd seen when I
was recovering in the sick room. According to Grover, the guy was the camp's head of security. He (<font color='blue'><b>Grover</b></font>)
supposedly had eyes all over his (<font color='blue'><b>Grover</b></font>) body so he (<font color='blue'><b>Grover</b></font>) could never be surprised. Today, though, he (<font color='blue'><b>Grover</b></font>) was wearing
a chauffeur's uniform, so I could only see extra peepers on his (<font color='blue'><b>Grover</b></font>) hands, face and neck.
<div class="bookquote">``This is Argus,''  (<font color='red'><b>Chiron</b></font>)</div>Chiron told me. <div class="bookquote">``He (<font color='blue'><b>I</b></font>) will drive you into the city, and, er, well, keep an eye on
things.''
 (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div>I heard footsteps behind us.
Luke came running up the hill, carrying a pair of basketball shoes.
<div class="bookquote">``Hey!''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Luke</b></font>) panted. <div class="bookquote">``Glad I caught you.''
 (<font color='red'><b>Annabeth/ANNABETH</b></font>)</div>Annabeth blushed, the way she (<font color='blue'><b>I</b></font>) always did when Luke was around.
<div class="bookquote">``Just wanted to say good luck,''  (<font color='red'><b>Luke</b></font>)</div>Luke told me. <div class="bookquote">``And I thought ... um, maybe you could use these.''
 (<font color='red'><b>He</b></font>)</div>He (<font color='blue'><b>Luke</b></font>) handed me the sneakers, which looked pretty normal. They even smelled kind of normal.
Luke said, <div class="bookquote">``Maia!''
 (<font color='red'><b>Luke</b></font>)</div>White bird's wings sprouted out of the heels, startling me so much, I dropped them. The shoes
flapped around on the ground until the wings folded up and disappeared.
<div class="bookquote">``Awesome!''  (<font color='red'><b>Grover/Grover Underwood/GROVER</b></font>)</div>Grover said.

<p/>Luke smiled. <div class="bookquote">``Those served me well when I was on my quest. Gift from Dad. Of course, I don't
use them much these days....''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>His (<font color='blue'><b>Luke</b></font>) expression turned sad.
I didn't know what to say. It was cool enough that Luke had come to say good-bye. I'd been afraid
he (<font color='blue'><b>Luke</b></font>) might resent me for getting so much attention the last few days. But here he (<font color='blue'><b>Luke</b></font>) was giving me a magic
gift.... It made me blush almost as much as Annabeth.
<div class="bookquote">``Hey, man,''  (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div>I said. <div class="bookquote">``Thanks.''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``Listen, Percy ...''  (<font color='red'><b>Luke</b></font>)</div>Luke looked uncomfortable. <div class="bookquote">``A lot of hopes are riding on you. So just ... kill
some monsters for me, okay?''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>We shook hands. Luke patted Grover's head between his (<font color='blue'><b>Luke</b></font>) horns, then gave a good-bye hug to
Annabeth, who looked like she (<font color='blue'><b>Luke</b></font>) might pass out.
After Luke was gone, I told her (<font color='blue'><b>Luke</b></font>), <div class="bookquote">``You're hyperventilating.''
 (<font color='red'><b>her</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``Am not.''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``You let him (<font color='blue'><b>Percy</b></font>) capture the flag instead of you, didn't you?''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``Oh ... why do I want to go anywhere with you, Percy?''
 (<font color='red'><b>She</b></font>)</div>She (<font color='blue'><b>Luke</b></font>) stomped down the other side of the hill, where a white SUV waited on the shoulder of the
road. Argus followed, jingling his (<font color='blue'><b>Luke</b></font>) car keys.
I picked up the flying shoes and had a sudden bad feeling. I looked at Chiron. <div class="bookquote">``I won't be able to
use these, will I?''
 (<font color='red'><b>He</b></font>)</div>He (<font color='blue'><b>Luke</b></font>) shook his (<font color='blue'><b>Luke</b></font>) head. <div class="bookquote">``Luke meant well, Percy. But taking to the air ... that would not be wise for
you.''
 (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div>I nodded, disappointed, but then I got an idea. <div class="bookquote">``Hey, Grover. You want a magic item?''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>His (<font color='blue'><b>Luke</b></font>) eyes lit up. <div class="bookquote">``Me?''
 (<font color='red'><b>world goat boy</b></font>)</div>Pretty soon we'd laced the sneakers over his (<font color='blue'><b>Luke</b></font>) fake feet, and the world's first flying goat boy was
ready for launch.
<div class="bookquote">``Maia!''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>) shouted.
He (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>) got off the ground okay, but then fell over sideways so his (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>) backpack dragged through the grass.
The winged shoes kept bucking up and down like tiny broncos.
<div class="bookquote">``Practice,''  (<font color='red'><b>Chiron</b></font>)</div>Chiron called after him (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>). <div class="bookquote">``You just need practice!''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``Aaaaa!''  (<font color='red'><b>Grover/Grover Underwood/GROVER</b></font>)</div>Grover went flying sideways down the hill like a possessed lawn mower, heading
toward the van.
Before I could follow, Chiron caught my arm. <div class="bookquote">``I should have trained you better, Percy,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Grover</b></font>) said.
<div class="bookquote">``If only I had more time. Hercules, Jason-they all got more training.''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>``That's okay. I just wish-``
I stopped myself because I was about to sound like a brat. I was wishing my dad had given me a
cool magic item to help on the quest, something as good as Luke's flying shoes, or Annabeth's
invisible cap.
<div class="bookquote">``What am I thinking?''  (<font color='red'><b>Chiron</b></font>)</div>Chiron cried. <div class="bookquote">``I can't let you get away without this.''
 (<font color='red'><b>He</b></font>)</div>He (<font color='blue'><b>Grover</b></font>) pulled a pen from his (<font color='blue'><b>Grover</b></font>) coat pocket and handed it to me. It was an ordinary disposable ballpoint,
black ink, removable cap. Probably cost thirty cents.
<div class="bookquote">``Gee,''  (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div>I said. <div class="bookquote">``Thanks.''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``Percy, that's a gift from your father. I've kept it for years, not knowing you were who I was
waiting for. But the prophecy is clear to me now. You are the one.''
 (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div>I remembered the field trip to the Metropolitan Museum of Art, when I'd vaporized Mrs. Dodds.
Chiron had thrown me a pen that turned into a sword. Could this be ... ?
I took off the cap, and the pen grew longer and heavier in my hand. In half a second, I held a

<p/>shimmering bronze sword with a double-edged blade, a leather-wrapped grip, and a flat hilt riveted
with gold studs. It was the first weapon that actually felt balanced in my hand.
<div class="bookquote">``The sword has a long and tragic history that we need not go into,''  (<font color='red'><b>me</b></font>)</div>Chiron told me. <div class="bookquote">``Its name is
Anaklusmos.''
 (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div>```Riptide,''' I translated, surprised the Ancient Greek came so easily.
<div class="bookquote">``Use it only for emergencies,''  (<font color='red'><b>Chiron</b></font>)</div>Chiron said, <div class="bookquote">``and only against monsters. No hero should harm
mortals unless absolutely necessary, of course, but this sword wouldn't harm them in any case.''
 (<font color='red'><b>Chiron</b></font>)</div>I looked at the wickedly sharp blade. <div class="bookquote">``What do you mean it wouldn't harm mortals? How could it
not?''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``The sword is celestial bronze. Forged by the Cyclopes, tempered in the heart of Mount Etna,
cooled in the River Lethe. It's deadly to monsters, to any creature from the Underworld, provided
they don't kill you first. But the blade will pass through mortals like an illusion. They simply are not
important enough for the blade to kill. And I should warn you: as a demigod, you can be killed by
either celestial or normal weapons. You are twice as vulnerable.''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``Good to know.''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``Now recap the pen.''
 (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div>I touched the pen cap to the sword tip and instantly Riptide shrank to a ballpoint pen again. I
tucked it in my pocket, a little nervous, because I was famous for losing pens at school.
<div class="bookquote">``You can't,''  (<font color='red'><b>Chiron</b></font>)</div>Chiron said.
<div class="bookquote">``Can't what?''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``Lose the pen,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Chiron</b></font>) said. <div class="bookquote">``It is enchanted. It will always reappear in your pocket. Try it.''
 (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div>I was wary, but I threw the pen as far as I could down the hill and watched it disappear in the
grass.
<div class="bookquote">``It may take a few moments,''  (<font color='red'><b>me</b></font>)</div>Chiron told me. <div class="bookquote">``Now check your pocket.''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>Sure enough, the pen was there.
<div class="bookquote">``Okay, that's extremely cool,''  (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div>I admitted. <div class="bookquote">``But what if a mortal sees me pulling out a sword?''
 (<font color='red'><b>Chiron</b></font>)</div>Chiron smiled. <div class="bookquote">``Mist is a powerful thing, Percy.''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``Mist?''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``Yes. Read The Iliad. It's full of references to the stuff. Whenever divine or monstrous elements
mix with the mortal world, they generate Mist, which obscures the vision of humans. You will see
things just as they are, being a half-blood, but humans will interpret things quite differently.
Remarkable, really, the lengths to which humans will go to fit things into their version of reality.''
 (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div>I put Riptide back in my pocket.
For the first time, the quest felt real. I was actually leaving Half-Blood Hill. I was heading west
with no adult supervision, no backup plan, not even a cell phone. -LRB-Chiron said cell phones were
traceable by monsters; if we used one, it would be worse than sending up a flare.-RRB- I had no weapon
stronger than a sword to fight off monsters and reach the Land of the Dead.
<div class="bookquote">``Chiron ...''  (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div>I said. <div class="bookquote">``When you say the gods are immortal... I mean, there was a time before them,
right?''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``Four ages before them, actually. The Time of the Titans was the Fourth Age, sometimes called
the Golden Age, which is definitely a misnomer. This, the time of Western civilization and the rule of
Zeus, is the Fifth Age.''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``So what was it like ... before the gods?''
 (<font color='red'><b>Chiron</b></font>)</div>Chiron pursed his (<font color='blue'><b>Hill</b></font>) lips. ``Even I am not old enough to remember that, child, but I know it was a
time of darkness and savagery for mortals. Kronos, the lord of the Titans, called his (<font color='blue'><b>Kronos</b></font>) reign the Golden

<p/>Age because men lived innocent and free of all knowledge. But that was mere propaganda. The Titan
king cared nothing for your kind except as appetizers or a source of cheap entertainment. It was only
in the early reign of Lord Zeus, when Prometheus the good Titan brought fire to mankind, that your
species began to progress, and even then Prometheus was branded a radical thinker. Zeus punished
him (<font color='blue'><b>Zeus</b></font>) severely, as you may recall. Of course, eventually the gods warmed to humans, and Western
civilization was born.''
``But the gods can't die now, right? I mean, as long as Western civilization is alive, they're alive.
So ... even if I failed, nothing could happen so bad it would mess up everything, right?''
Chiron gave me a melancholy smile. ``No one knows how long the Age of the West will last,
Percy. The gods are immortal, yes. But then, so were the Titans. They still exist, locked away in their
various prisons, forced to endure endless pain and punishment, reduced in power, but still very much
alive. May the Fates forbid that the gods should ever suffer such a doom, or that we should ever
return to the darkness and chaos of the past. All we can do, child, is follow our destiny.''
``Our destiny ... assuming we know what that is.''
``Relax,'' Chiron told me. ``Keep a clear head. And remember, you may be about to prevent the
biggest war in human history.''
``Relax,'' I said. ``I'm very relaxed.''
When I got to the bottom of the hill, I looked back. Under the pine tree that used to be Thalia,
daughter of Zeus, Chiron was now standing in full horse-man form, holding his (<font color='blue'><b>Zeus</b></font>) bow high in salute.
Just your typical summer-camp send-off by your typical centaur.
***
Argus drove us out of the countryside and into western Long Island. It felt weird to be on a
highway again, Annabeth and Grover sitting next to me as if we were normal carpoolers. After two
weeks at Half-Blood Hill, the real world seemed like a fantasy. I found myself staring at every
McDonald's, every kid in the back of his (<font color='blue'><b>kid</b></font>) parents' car, every billboard and shopping mall.
``So far so good,'' I told Annabeth. ``Ten miles and not a single monster.''
She (<font color='blue'><b>kid</b></font>) gave me an irritated look. ``It's bad luck to talk that way, seaweed brain.''
``Remind me again-why do you hate me so much?''
``I don't hate you.''
``Could've fooled me.''
She (<font color='blue'><b>kid</b></font>) folded her (<font color='blue'><b>kid</b></font>) cap of invisibility. ``Look ... we're just not supposed to get along, okay? Our
parents are rivals.''
``Why?''
She (<font color='blue'><b>kid</b></font>) sighed. ``How many reasons do you want? One time my mom caught Poseidon with his (<font color='blue'><b>I</b></font>)
girlfriend in Athena's temple, which is hugely disrespectful. Another time, Athena and Poseidon
competed to be the patron god for the city of Athens. Your dad created some stupid saltwater spring
for his (<font color='blue'><b>dad</b></font>) gift. My mom created the olive tree. The people saw that her (<font color='blue'><b>mom</b></font>) gift was better, so they named the
city after her (<font color='blue'><b>mom</b></font>).''
``They must really like olives.''
``Oh, forget it.''
``Now, if she (<font color='blue'><b>mom</b></font>)'d invented pizza-that I could understand.''
<div class="bookquote">``I said, forget it!''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>In the front seat, Argus smiled. He (<font color='blue'><b>kid</b></font>) didn't say anything, but one blue eye on the back of his (<font color='blue'><b>kid</b></font>) neck
winked at me.
Traffic slowed us down in Queens. By the time we got into Manhattan it was sunset and starting to

<p/>rain.
Argus dropped us at the Greyhound Station on the Upper East Side, not far from my mom and
Gabe's apartment. Taped to a mailbox was a soggy flyer with my picture on it: HAVE YOU SEEN
THIS BOY?
I ripped it down before Annabeth and Grover could notice.
Argus unloaded our bags, made sure we got our bus tickets, then drove away, the eye on the back
of his (<font color='blue'><b>Grover</b></font>) hand opening to watch us as he (<font color='blue'><b>Grover</b></font>) pulled out of the parking lot.
I thought about how close I was to my old apartment. On a normal day, my mom would be home
from the candy store by now. Smelly Gabe was probably up there right now, playing poker, not even
missing her (<font color='blue'><b>mom</b></font>).
Grover shouldered his (<font color='blue'><b>Grover</b></font>) backpack. He (<font color='blue'><b>Grover</b></font>) gazed down the street in the direction I was looking. <div class="bookquote">``You
want to know why she (<font color='blue'><b>mom</b></font>) married him (<font color='blue'><b>dad</b></font>), Percy?''
 (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div>I stared at him (<font color='blue'><b>Grover</b></font>). <div class="bookquote">``Were you reading my mind or something?''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``Just your emotions.''  (<font color='red'><b>He</b></font>)</div>He (<font color='blue'><b>Grover</b></font>) shrugged. <div class="bookquote">``Guess I forgot to tell you satyrs can do that. You were
thinking about your mom and your stepdad, right?''
 (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div>I nodded, wondering what else Grover might've forgotten to tell me.
<div class="bookquote">``Your mom married Gabe for you,''  (<font color='red'><b>Grover/Grover Underwood/GROVER</b></font>)</div>Grover told me. <div class="bookquote">``You call him (<font color='blue'><b>Gabe</b></font>) `Smelly,' but you've got no
idea. The guy has this aura.... Yuck. I can smell him (<font color='blue'><b>guy</b></font>) from here. I can smell traces of him (<font color='blue'><b>guy</b></font>) on you, and
you haven't been near him (<font color='blue'><b>guy</b></font>) for a week.''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``Thanks,''  (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div>I said. <div class="bookquote">``Where's the nearest shower?''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``You should be grateful, Percy. Your stepfather smells so repulsively human he (<font color='blue'><b>stepfather</b></font>) could mask the
presence of any demigod. As soon as I took a whiff inside his (<font color='blue'><b>stepfather</b></font>) Camaro, I knew: Gabe has been
covering your scent for years. If you hadn't lived with him (<font color='blue'><b>Gabe</b></font>) every summer, you probably would've
been found by monsters a long time ago. Your mom stayed with him (<font color='blue'><b>Gabe</b></font>) to protect you. She (<font color='blue'><b>mom</b></font>) was a smart
lady. She (<font color='blue'><b>mom</b></font>) must've loved you a lot to put up with that guy-if that makes you feel any better.''
 (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div>It didn't, but I forced myself not to show it. I'll see her (<font color='blue'><b>mom</b></font>) again, I thought. She (<font color='blue'><b>mom</b></font>) isn't gone.
I wondered if Grover could still read my emotions, mixed up as they were. I was glad he (<font color='blue'><b>Grover</b></font>) and
Annabeth were with me, but I felt guilty that I hadn't been straight with them. I hadn't told them the
real reason I'd said yes to this crazy quest.
The truth was, I didn't care about retrieving Zeus's lightning bolt, or saving the world, or even
helping my father out of trouble. The more I thought about it, I resented Poseidon for never visiting
me, never helping my mom, never even sending a lousy child-support check. He (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>)'d only claimed me
because he (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) needed a job done.
All I cared about was my mom. Hades had taken her (<font color='blue'><b>mom</b></font>) unfairly, and Hades was going to give her (<font color='blue'><b>mom</b></font>)
back.
You will be betrayed by one who calls you a friend, the Oracle whispered in my mind. You will
fail to save what matters most in the end.
Shut up, I told it.
The rain kept coming down.
We got restless waiting for the bus and decided to play some Hacky Sack with one of Grover's
apples. Annabeth was unbelievable. She (<font color='blue'><b>mom</b></font>) could bounce the apple off her (<font color='blue'><b>mom</b></font>) knee, her (<font color='blue'><b>mom</b></font>) elbow, her (<font color='blue'><b>mom</b></font>)
shoulder, whatever. I wasn't too bad myself.
The game ended when I tossed the apple toward Grover and it got too close to his (<font color='blue'><b>Grover</b></font>) mouth. In one
mega goat bite, our Hacky Sack disappeared-core, stem, and all.
Grover blushed. He (<font color='blue'><b>Grover</b></font>) tried to apologize, but Annabeth and I were too busy cracking up.

<p/>Finally the bus came. As we stood in line to board, Grover started looking around, sniffing the air
like he (<font color='blue'><b>Grover</b></font>) smelled his (<font color='blue'><b>Grover</b></font>) favorite school cafeteria delicacy-enchiladas.
<div class="bookquote">``What is it?''  (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div>I asked.
<div class="bookquote">``I don't know,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Grover</b></font>) said tensely. <div class="bookquote">``Maybe it's nothing.''
 (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div>But I could tell it wasn't nothing. I started looking over my shoulder, too.
I was relieved when we finally got on board and found seats together in the back of the bus. We
stowed our backpacks. Annabeth kept slapping her (<font color='blue'><b>I</b></font>) Yankees cap nervously against her (<font color='blue'><b>I</b></font>) thigh.
As the last passengers got on, Annabeth clamped her (<font color='blue'><b>I</b></font>) hand onto my knee. <div class="bookquote">``Percy.''
 (<font color='red'><b>An lady</b></font>)</div>An old lady had just boarded the bus. She (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) wore a crumpled velvet dress, lace gloves, and a
shapeless orange-knit hat that shadowed her (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) face, and she (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) carried a big paisley purse. When she (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) tilted
her (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) head up, her (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) black eyes glittered, and my heart skipped a beat.
It was Mrs. Dodds. Older, more withered, but definitely the same evil face.
I scrunched down in my seat.
Behind her (<font color='blue'><b>Dodds</b></font>) came two more old ladies: one in a green hat, one in a purple hat. Otherwise they
looked exactly like Mrs. Dodds-same gnarled hands, paisley handbags, wrinkled velvet dresses.
Triplet demon grandmothers.
They sat in the front row, right behind the driver. The two on the aisle crossed their legs over the
walkway, making an X. It was casual enough, but it sent a clear message: nobody leaves.
The bus pulled out of the station, and we headed through the slick streets of Manhattan. <div class="bookquote">``She (<font color='blue'><b>mom</b></font>)
didn't stay dead long,''  (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div>I said, trying to keep my voice from quivering. <div class="bookquote">``I thought you said they could
be dispelled for a lifetime.''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``I said if you're lucky,''  (<font color='red'><b>Annabeth/ANNABETH</b></font>)</div>Annabeth said. <div class="bookquote">``You're obviously not.''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``All three of them,''  (<font color='red'><b>Grover/Grover Underwood/GROVER</b></font>)</div>Grover whimpered. <div class="bookquote">``Di immortales!''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``It's okay,''  (<font color='red'><b>Annabeth/ANNABETH</b></font>)</div>Annabeth said, obviously thinking hard. <div class="bookquote">``The Furies. The three worst monsters from
the Underworld. No problem. No problem. We'll just slip out the windows.''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``They don't open,''  (<font color='red'><b>Grover/Grover Underwood/GROVER</b></font>)</div>Grover moaned.
<div class="bookquote">``A back exit?''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>It</b></font>) suggested.
There wasn't one. Even if there had been, it wouldn't have helped. By that time, we were on
Ninth Avenue, heading for the Lincoln Tunnel.
<div class="bookquote">``They won't attack us with witnesses around,''  (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div>I said. <div class="bookquote">``Will they?''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``Mortals don't have good eyes,''  (<font color='red'><b>Annabeth/ANNABETH</b></font>)</div>Annabeth reminded me. <div class="bookquote">``Their brains can only process what
they see through the Mist.''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``They'll see three old ladies killing us, won't they?''
 (<font color='red'><b>She</b></font>)</div>She (<font color='blue'><b>It</b></font>) thought about it. <div class="bookquote">``Hard to say. But we can't count on mortals for help. Maybe an emergency
exit in the roof ... ?''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>We hit the Lincoln Tunnel, and the bus went dark except for the running lights down the aisle. It
was eerily quiet without the sound of the rain.
Mrs. Dodds got up. In a flat voice, as if she (<font color='blue'><b>Dodds</b></font>)'d rehearsed it, she (<font color='blue'><b>Dodds</b></font>) announced to the whole bus: <div class="bookquote">``I
need to use the rest-room.''
 (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``So do I,''  (<font color='red'><b>the sister</b></font>)</div>said the second sister.
<div class="bookquote">``So do I,''  (<font color='red'><b>the sister</b></font>)</div>said the third sister.
They all started coming down the aisle.
<div class="bookquote">``I've got it,''  (<font color='red'><b>Annabeth/ANNABETH</b></font>)</div>Annabeth said. <div class="bookquote">``Percy, take my hat.''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``What?''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>``You're the one they want. Turn invisible and go up the aisle. Let them pass you. Maybe you can

<p/>get to the front and get away.''
``But you guys-``
``There's an outside chance they might not notice us,'' Annabeth said. ``You're a son of one of the
Big Three. Your smell might be overpowering.''
``I can't just leave you.''
``Don't worry about us,'' Grover said. ``Go!''
My hands trembled. I felt like a coward, but I took the Yankees cap and put it on.
When I looked down, my body wasn't there anymore.
I started creeping up the aisle. I managed to get up ten rows, then duck into an empty seat just as
the Furies walked past.
Mrs. Dodds stopped, sniffing, and looked straight at me. My heart was pounding.
Apparently she (<font color='blue'><b>Dodds</b></font>) didn't see anything. She (<font color='blue'><b>Dodds</b></font>) and her (<font color='blue'><b>Dodds</b></font>) sisters kept going.
I was free. I made it to the front of the bus. We were almost through the Lincoln Tunnel now. I
was about to press the emergency stop button when I heard hideous wailing from the back row.
The old ladies were not old ladies anymore. Their faces were still the same-I guess those
couldn't get any uglier- but their bodies had shriveled into leathery brown hag bodies with bat's
wings and hands and feet like gargoyle claws. Their handbags had turned into fiery whips.
The Furies surrounded Grover and Annabeth, lashing their whips, hissing: ``Where is it? Where?''
The other people on the bus were screaming, cowering in their seats. They saw something, all
right.
``He (<font color='blue'><b>son</b></font>)'s not here!'' Annabeth yelled. ``He (<font color='blue'><b>son</b></font>)'s gone!''
The Furies raised their whips.
Annabeth drew her (<font color='blue'><b>Furies</b></font>) bronze knife. Grover grabbed a tin can from his (<font color='blue'><b>Grover</b></font>) snack bag and prepared to
throw it.
What I did next was so impulsive and dangerous I should've been named ADHD poster child of
the year.
The bus driver was distracted, trying to see what was going on in his (<font color='blue'><b>driver</b></font>) rearview mirror.
Still invisible, I grabbed the wheel from him (<font color='blue'><b>driver</b></font>) and jerked it to the left. Everybody howled as they
were thrown to the right, and I heard what I hoped was the sound of three Furies smashing against the
windows.
``Hey!'' the driver yelled. <div class="bookquote">``Hey-whoa!''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>We wrestled for the wheel. The bus slammed against the side of the tunnel, grinding metal,
throwing sparks a mile behind us.
We careened out of the Lincoln Tunnel and back into the rainstorm, people and monsters tossed
around the bus, cars plowed aside like bowling pins.
Somehow the driver found an exit. We shot off the highway, through half a dozen traffic lights, and
ended up barreling down one of those New Jersey rural roads where you can't believe there's so
much nothing right across the river from New York. There were woods to our left, the Hudson River
to our right, and the driver seemed to be veering toward the river.
Another great idea: I hit the emergency brake.
The bus wailed, spun a full circle on the wet asphalt, and crashed into the trees. The emergency
lights came on. The door flew open. The bus driver was the first one out, the passengers yelling as
they stampeded after him (<font color='blue'><b>driver</b></font>). I stepped into the driver's seat and let them pass.
The Furies regained their balance. They lashed their whips at Annabeth while she (<font color='blue'><b>driver</b></font>) waved her (<font color='blue'><b>driver</b></font>)
knife and yelled in Ancient Greek, telling them to back off. Grover threw tin cans.

<p/>I looked at the open doorway. I was free to go, but I couldn't leave my friends. I took off the
invisible cap. <div class="bookquote">``Hey!''
 (<font color='red'><b>The Furies</b></font>)</div>The Furies turned, baring their yellow fangs at me, and the exit suddenly seemed like an excellent
idea. Mrs. Dodds stalked up the aisle, just as she (<font color='blue'><b>Dodds</b></font>) used to do in class, about to deliver my F- math test.
Every time she (<font color='blue'><b>Dodds</b></font>) flicked her (<font color='blue'><b>Dodds</b></font>) whip, red flames danced along the barbed leather.
Her (<font color='blue'><b>Dodds</b></font>) two ugly sisters hopped on top of the seats on either side of her (<font color='blue'><b>Dodds</b></font>) and crawled toward me like
huge nasty lizards.
<div class="bookquote">``Perseus Jackson,''  (<font color='red'><b>Mrs. Dodds/Dodds</b></font>)</div>Mrs. Dodds said, in an accent that was definitely from somewhere farther
south than Georgia. <div class="bookquote">``You have offended the gods. You shall die.''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``I liked you better as a math teacher,''  (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div>I told her (<font color='blue'><b>Dodds</b></font>).
She (<font color='blue'><b>Dodds</b></font>) growled.
Annabeth and Grover moved up behind the Furies cautiously, looking for an opening.
I took the ballpoint pen out of my pocket and uncapped it. Riptide elongated into a shimmering
double-edged sword.
The Furies hesitated.
Mrs. Dodds had felt Riptide's blade before. She (<font color='blue'><b>Dodds</b></font>) obviously didn't like seeing it again.
<div class="bookquote">``Submit now,''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Dodds</b></font>) hissed. <div class="bookquote">``And you will not suffer eternal torment.''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``Nice try,''  (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div>I told her (<font color='blue'><b>Dodds</b></font>).
<div class="bookquote">``Percy, look out!''  (<font color='red'><b>Annabeth/ANNABETH</b></font>)</div>Annabeth cried.
Mrs. Dodds lashed her (<font color='blue'><b>Dodds</b></font>) whip around my sword hand while the Furies on the either side lunged at
me.
My hand felt like it was wrapped in molten lead, but I managed not to drop Riptide. I stuck the
Fury on the left with its hilt, sending her (<font color='blue'><b>Dodds</b></font>) toppling backward into a seat. I turned and sliced the Fury on
the right. As soon as the blade connected with her (<font color='blue'><b>Dodds</b></font>) neck, she (<font color='blue'><b>Dodds</b></font>) screamed and exploded into dust.
Annabeth got Mrs. Dodds in a wrestler's hold and yanked her (<font color='blue'><b>Dodds</b></font>) backward while Grover ripped the
whip out of her (<font color='blue'><b>Dodds</b></font>) hands.
<div class="bookquote">``Ow!''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Grover</b></font>) yelled. <div class="bookquote">``Ow! Hot! Hot!''
 (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div>The Fury I'd hilt-slammed came at me again, talons ready, but I swung Riptide and she (<font color='blue'><b>Dodds</b></font>) broke
open like a piñata.
Mrs. Dodds was trying to get Annabeth off her (<font color='blue'><b>Dodds</b></font>) back. She (<font color='blue'><b>Dodds</b></font>) kicked, clawed, hissed and bit, but
Annabeth held on while Grover got Mrs. Dodds's legs tied up in her (<font color='blue'><b>Dodds</b></font>) own whip. Finally they both
shoved her (<font color='blue'><b>Dodds</b></font>) backward into the aisle. Mrs. Dodds tried to get up, but she (<font color='blue'><b>Dodds</b></font>) didn't have room to flap her (<font color='blue'><b>Dodds</b></font>)
bat wings, so she (<font color='blue'><b>Dodds</b></font>) kept falling down.
<div class="bookquote">``Zeus will destroy you!''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Dodds</b></font>) promised. <div class="bookquote">``Hades will have your soul!''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``Braccas meas vescimini!''  (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div>I yelled.
I wasn't sure where the Latin came from. I think it meant <div class="bookquote">``Eat my pants!''
 (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div>Thunder shook the bus. The hair rose on the back of my neck.
<div class="bookquote">``Get out!''  (<font color='red'><b>Annabeth/ANNABETH</b></font>)</div>Annabeth yelled at me. <div class="bookquote">``Now!''  (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div>I didn't need any encouragement.
We rushed outside and found the other passengers wandering around in a daze, arguing with the
driver, or running around in circles yelling, <div class="bookquote">``We're going to die!''  (<font color='red'><b>the driver</b></font>)</div>A Hawaiian-shirted tourist with a
camera snapped my photograph before I could recap my sword.
<div class="bookquote">``Our bags!''  (<font color='red'><b>Grover/Grover Underwood/GROVER</b></font>)</div>Grover realized. ``We left our-``
BOOOOOM!
The windows of the bus exploded as the passengers ran for cover. Lightning shredded a huge
crater in the roof, but an angry wail from inside told me Mrs. Dodds was not yet dead.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Run!''  (<font color='red'><b>Annabeth/ANNABETH</b></font>)</div>Annabeth said. <div class="bookquote">``She (<font color='blue'><b>Dodds</b></font>)'s calling for reinforcements! We have to get out of here!''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>We plunged into the woods as the rain poured down, the bus in flames behind us, and nothing but
darkness ahead.

<p/>Percy Jackson 1 - The Lightning Thief
11 WE VISIT THE GARDEN
GNOME EMPORIUM
In a way, it's nice to know there are Greek gods out there, because you have somebody to blame
when things go wrong. For instance, when you're walking away from a bus that's just been attacked
by monster hags and blown up by lightning, and it's raining on top of everything else, most people
might think that's just really bad luck; when you're a half-blood, you understand that some divine
force really is trying to mess up your day.
So there we were, Annabeth and Grover and I, walking through the woods along the New Jersey
riverbank, the glow of New York City making the night sky yellow behind us, and the smell of the
Hudson reeking in our noses.
Grover was shivering and braying, his (<font color='blue'><b>Grover</b></font>) big goat eyes turned slit-pupiled and full of terror. <div class="bookquote">``Three
Kindly Ones. All three at once.''
 (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div>I was pretty much in shock myself. The explosion of bus windows still rang in my ears. But
Annabeth kept pulling us along, saying: <div class="bookquote">``Come on! The farther away we get, the better.''
 (<font color='red'><b>Annabeth/ANNABETH</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``All our money was back there,''  (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div>I reminded her (<font color='blue'><b>I</b></font>). <div class="bookquote">``Our food and clothes. Everything.''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>``Well, maybe if you hadn't decided to jump into the fight-``
<div class="bookquote">``What did you want me to do? Let you get killed?''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``You didn't need to protect me, Percy. I would've been fine.''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``Sliced like sandwich bread,''  (<font color='red'><b>Grover/Grover Underwood/GROVER</b></font>)</div>Grover put in, <div class="bookquote">``but fine.''
 (<font color='red'><b>Grover/Grover Underwood/GROVER</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``Shut up, goat boy,''  (<font color='red'><b>Annabeth/ANNABETH</b></font>)</div>said Annabeth.
Grover brayed mournfully. <div class="bookquote">``Tin cans ... a perfectly good bag of tin cans.''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>We sloshed across mushy ground, through nasty twisted trees that smelled like sour laundry.
After a few minutes, Annabeth fell into line next to me. <div class="bookquote">``Look, I...''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>Her (<font color='blue'><b>I</b></font>) voice faltered. <div class="bookquote">``I
appreciate your coming back for us, okay? That was really brave.''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``We're a team, right?''
 (<font color='red'><b>She</b></font>)</div>She (<font color='blue'><b>I</b></font>) was silent for a few more steps. <div class="bookquote">``It's just that if you died ... aside from the fact that it would
really suck for you, it would mean the quest was over. This may be my only chance to see the real
world.''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>The thunderstorm had finally let up. The city glow faded behind us, leaving us in almost total
darkness. I couldn't see anything of Annabeth except a glint of her (<font color='blue'><b>I</b></font>) blond hair.
<div class="bookquote">``You haven't left Camp Half-Blood since you were seven?''  (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div>I asked her (<font color='blue'><b>I</b></font>).
``No ... only short field trips. My dad-``
<div class="bookquote">``The history professor.''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``Yeah. It didn't work out for me living at home. I mean, Camp Half-Blood is my home.''  (<font color='red'><b>She</b></font>)</div>She (<font color='blue'><b>I</b></font>) was
rushing her (<font color='blue'><b>I</b></font>) words out now, as if she (<font color='blue'><b>I</b></font>) were afraid somebody might try to stop her (<font color='blue'><b>I</b></font>). <div class="bookquote">``At camp you train
and train. And that's all cool and everything, but the real world is where the monsters are. That's
where you learn whether you're any good or not.''
 (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div>If I didn't know better, I could've sworn I heard doubt in her (<font color='blue'><b>I</b></font>) voice.
<div class="bookquote">``You're pretty good with that knife,''  (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div>I said.
<div class="bookquote">``You think so?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Anybody who can piggyback-ride a Fury is okay by me.''
 (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div>I couldn't really see, but I thought she (<font color='blue'><b>I</b></font>) might've smiled.
<div class="bookquote">``You know,''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>I</b></font>) said, <div class="bookquote">``maybe I should tell you ... Something funny back on the bus ...''
 (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>Whatever she (<font color='blue'><b>I</b></font>) wanted to say was interrupted by a shrill toot-toot-toot, like the sound of an owl
being tortured.
<div class="bookquote">``Hey, my reed pipes still work!''  (<font color='red'><b>Grover/Grover Underwood/GROVER</b></font>)</div>Grover cried. <div class="bookquote">``If I could just remember a `find path' song, we
could get out of these woods!''
 (<font color='red'><b>He</b></font>)</div>He (<font color='blue'><b>Grover</b></font>) puffed out a few notes, but the tune still sounded suspiciously like Hilary Duff.
Instead of finding a path, I immediately slammed into a tree and got a nice-size knot on my head.
Add to the list of superpowers I did not have: infrared vision.
After tripping and cursing and generally feeling miserable for another mile or so, I started to see
light up ahead: the colors of a neon sign. I could smell food. Fried, greasy, excellent food. I realized I
hadn't eaten anything unhealthy since I'd arrived at Half-Blood Hill, where we lived on grapes,
bread, cheese, and extra-lean-cut nymph-prepared barbecue. This boy needed a double cheeseburger.
We kept walking until I saw a deserted two-lane road through the trees. On the other side was a
closed-down gas station, a tattered billboard for a 1990s movie, and one open business, which was
the source of the neon light and the good smell.
It wasn't a fast-food restaurant like I'd hoped. It was one of those weird roadside curio shops that
sell lawn flamingos and wooden Indians and cement grizzly bears and stuff like that. The main
building was a long, low warehouse, surrounded by acres of statuary. The neon sign above the gate
was impossible for me to read, because if there's anything worse for my dyslexia than regular
English, it's red cursive neon English.
To me, it looked like: ATNYU MES GDERAN GOMEN MEPROUIM.
<div class="bookquote">``What the heck does that say?''  (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div>I asked.
<div class="bookquote">``I don't know,''  (<font color='red'><b>Annabeth/ANNABETH</b></font>)</div>Annabeth said.
She (<font color='blue'><b>I</b></font>) loved reading so much, I'd forgotten she (<font color='blue'><b>I</b></font>) was dyslexic, too.
Grover translated: <div class="bookquote">``Aunty Em's Garden Gnome Emporium.''
 (<font color='red'><b>Grover/Grover Underwood/GROVER</b></font>)</div>Flanking the entrance, as advertised, were two cement garden gnomes, ugly bearded little runts,
smiling and waving, as if they were about to get their picture taken.
I crossed the street, following the smell of the hamburgers.
<div class="bookquote">``Hey ...''  (<font color='red'><b>Grover/Grover Underwood/GROVER</b></font>)</div>Grover warned.
<div class="bookquote">``The lights are on inside,''  (<font color='red'><b>Annabeth/ANNABETH</b></font>)</div>Annabeth said. <div class="bookquote">``Maybe it's open.''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``Snack bar,''  (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div>I said wistfully.
<div class="bookquote">``Snack bar,''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>I</b></font>) agreed.
<div class="bookquote">``Are you two crazy?''  (<font color='red'><b>Grover/Grover Underwood/GROVER</b></font>)</div>Grover said. <div class="bookquote">``This place is weird.''
 (<font color='red'><b>him</b></font>)</div>We ignored him (<font color='blue'><b>Grover</b></font>).
The front lot was a forest of statues: cement animals, cement children, even a cement satyr playing
the pipes, which gave Grover the creeps.
<div class="bookquote">``Bla-ha-ha!''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Grover</b></font>) bleated. <div class="bookquote">``Looks like my Uncle Ferdinand!''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>We stopped at the warehouse door.
<div class="bookquote">``Don't knock,''  (<font color='red'><b>Grover/Grover Underwood/GROVER</b></font>)</div>Grover pleaded. <div class="bookquote">``I smell monsters.''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``Your nose is clogged up from the Furies,''  (<font color='red'><b>Annabeth/ANNABETH</b></font>)</div>Annabeth told him (<font color='blue'><b>Grover</b></font>). <div class="bookquote">``All I smell is burgers. Aren't you
hungry?''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``Meat!''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Grover</b></font>) said scornfully. <div class="bookquote">``I'm a vegetarian.''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``You eat cheese enchiladas and aluminum cans,''  (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div>I reminded him (<font color='blue'><b>Grover</b></font>).

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Those are vegetables. Come on. Let's leave. These statues are ... looking at me.''
 (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div>Then the door creaked open, and standing in front of us was a tall Middle Eastern woman-at least,
I assumed she (<font color='blue'><b>I</b></font>) was Middle Eastern, because she (<font color='blue'><b>I</b></font>) wore a long black gown that covered everything but
her (<font color='blue'><b>I</b></font>) hands, and her (<font color='blue'><b>I</b></font>) head was completely veiled. Her (<font color='blue'><b>I</b></font>) eyes glinted behind a curtain of black gauze, but
that was about all I could make out. Her (<font color='blue'><b>I</b></font>) coffee-colored hands looked old, but well-manicured and
elegant, so I imagined she (<font color='blue'><b>I</b></font>) was a grandmother who had once been a beautiful lady.
Her (<font color='blue'><b>I</b></font>) accent sounded vaguely Middle Eastern, too. She (<font color='blue'><b>I</b></font>) said, <div class="bookquote">``Children, it is too late to be out all
alone. Where are your parents?''
 (<font color='red'><b>She</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``They're ... um ...''  (<font color='red'><b>Annabeth/ANNABETH</b></font>)</div>Annabeth started to say.
<div class="bookquote">``We're orphans,''  (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div>I said.
<div class="bookquote">``Orphans?''  (<font color='red'><b>the woman</b></font>)</div>the woman said. The word sounded alien in her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) mouth. <div class="bookquote">``But, my dears! Surely not!''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``We got separated from our caravan,''  (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div>I said. <div class="bookquote">``Our circus caravan. The ringmaster told us to meet
him (<font color='blue'><b>ringmaster</b></font>) at the gas station if we got lost, but he (<font color='blue'><b>ringmaster</b></font>) may have forgotten, or maybe he (<font color='blue'><b>ringmaster</b></font>) meant a different gas
station. Anyway, we're lost. Is that food I smell?''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``Oh, my dears,''  (<font color='red'><b>the woman</b></font>)</div>the woman said. <div class="bookquote">``You must come in, poor children. I am Aunty Em. Go straight
through to the back of the warehouse, please. There is a dining area.''
 (<font color='red'><b>her</b></font>)</div>We thanked her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) and went inside.
Annabeth muttered to me, <div class="bookquote">``Circus caravan?''
 (<font color='red'><b>me</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``Always have a strategy, right?''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``Your head is full of kelp.''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>The warehouse was filled with more statues-people in all different poses, wearing all different
outfits and with different expressions on their faces. I was thinking you'd have to have a pretty huge
garden to fit even one of these statues, because they were all life-size. But mostly, I was thinking
about food.
Go ahead, call me an idiot for walking into a strange lady's shop like that just because I was
hungry, but I do impulsive stuff sometimes. Plus, you've never smelled Aunty Em's burgers. The
aroma was like laughing gas in the dentist's chair-it made everything else go away. I barely noticed
Grover's nervous whimpers, or the way the statues' eyes seemed to follow me, or the fact that Aunty
Em had locked the door behind us.
All I cared about was finding the dining area. And sure enough, there it was at the back of the
warehouse, a fast-food counter with a grill, a soda fountain, a pretzel heater, and a nacho cheese
dispenser. Everything you could want, plus a few steel picnic tables out front.
<div class="bookquote">``Please, sit down,''  (<font color='red'><b>Aunty</b></font>)</div>Aunty Em said.
<div class="bookquote">``Awesome,''  (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div>I said.
<div class="bookquote">``Um,''  (<font color='red'><b>Grover/Grover Underwood/GROVER</b></font>)</div>Grover said reluctantly, <div class="bookquote">``we don't have any money, ma’am.''
 (<font color='red'><b>Grover/Grover Underwood/GROVER</b></font>)</div>Before I could jab him (<font color='blue'><b>Grover</b></font>) in the ribs, Aunty Em said, <div class="bookquote">``No, no, children. No money. This is a special
case, yes? It is my treat, for such nice orphans.''
 (<font color='red'><b>Aunty Em</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``Thank you, ma’am,''  (<font color='red'><b>Annabeth/ANNABETH</b></font>)</div>Annabeth said.
Aunty Em stiffened, as if Annabeth had done something wrong, but then the old woman relaxed
just as quickly, so I figured it must've been my imagination.
<div class="bookquote">``Quite all right, Annabeth,''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) said. <div class="bookquote">``You have such beautiful gray eyes, child.''  (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div>Only later did I
wonder how she (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) knew Annabeth's name, even though we had never introduced ourselves.
Our hostess disappeared behind the snack counter and started cooking. Before we knew it, she (<font color='blue'><b>hostess</b></font>)'d
brought us plastic trays heaped with double cheeseburgers, vanilla shakes, and XXL servings of
French fries.

<p/>I was halfway through my burger before I remembered to breathe.
Annabeth slurped her (<font color='blue'><b>hostess</b></font>) shake.
Grover picked at the fries, and eyed the tray's waxed paper liner as if he (<font color='blue'><b>Grover</b></font>) might go for that, but he (<font color='blue'><b>Grover</b></font>)
still looked too nervous to eat.
<div class="bookquote">``What's that hissing noise?''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Grover</b></font>) asked.
I listened, but didn't hear anything. Annabeth shook her (<font color='blue'><b>hostess</b></font>) head.
<div class="bookquote">``Hissing?''  (<font color='red'><b>Aunty</b></font>)</div>Aunty Em asked. <div class="bookquote">``Perhaps you hear the deep-fryer oil. You have keen ears, Grover.''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``I take vitamins. For my ears.''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``That's admirable,''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>hostess</b></font>) said. <div class="bookquote">``But please, relax.''
 (<font color='red'><b>Aunty</b></font>)</div>Aunty Em ate nothing. She (<font color='blue'><b>hostess</b></font>) hadn't taken off her (<font color='blue'><b>hostess</b></font>) headdress, even to cook, and now she (<font color='blue'><b>hostess</b></font>) sat forward
and interlaced her (<font color='blue'><b>hostess</b></font>) fingers and watched us eat. It was a little unsettling, having someone stare at me
when I couldn't see her (<font color='blue'><b>hostess</b></font>) face, but I was feeling satisfied after the burger, and a little sleepy, and I
figured the least I could do was try to make small talk with our hostess.
<div class="bookquote">``So, you sell gnomes,''  (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div>I said, trying to sound interested.
<div class="bookquote">``Oh, yes,''  (<font color='red'><b>Aunty</b></font>)</div>Aunty Em said. <div class="bookquote">``And animals. And people. Anything for the garden. Custom orders.
Statuary is very popular, you know.''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``A lot of business on this road?''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``Not so much, no. Since the highway was built... most cars, they do not go this way now. I must
cherish every customer I get.''
 (<font color='red'><b>somebody</b></font>)</div>My neck tingled, as if somebody else was looking at me. I turned, but it was just a statue of a
young girl holding an Easter basket. The detail was incredible, much better than you see in most
garden statues. But something was wrong with her (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) face. It looked as if she (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) were startled, or even
terrified.
<div class="bookquote">``Ah,''  (<font color='red'><b>Aunty</b></font>)</div>Aunty Em said sadly. <div class="bookquote">``You notice some of my creations do not turn out well. They are
marred. They do not sell. The face is the hardest to get right. Always the face.''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``You make these statues yourself?''  (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div>I asked.
<div class="bookquote">``Oh, yes. Once upon a time, I had two sisters to help me in the business, but they have passed on,
and Aunty Em is alone. I have only my statues. This is why I make them, you see. They are my
company.''  (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div>The sadness in her (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) voice sounded so deep and so real that I couldn't help feeling sorry for
her (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>).
Annabeth had stopped eating. She (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) sat forward and said, <div class="bookquote">``Two sisters?''
 (<font color='red'><b>She</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``It's a terrible story,''  (<font color='red'><b>Aunty</b></font>)</div>Aunty Em said. <div class="bookquote">``Not one for children, really. You see, Annabeth, a bad
woman was jealous of me, long ago, when I was young. I had a... a boyfriend, you know, and this bad
woman was determined to break us apart. She (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) caused a terrible accident. My sisters stayed by me.
They shared my bad fortune as long as they could, but eventually they passed on. They faded away. I
alone have survived, but at a price. Such a price.''
 (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div>I wasn't sure what she (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) meant, but I felt bad for her (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>). My eyelids kept getting heavier, my full
stomach making me sleepy. Poor old lady. Who would want to hurt somebody so nice?
<div class="bookquote">``Percy?''  (<font color='red'><b>Annabeth/ANNABETH</b></font>)</div>Annabeth was shaking me to get my attention. <div class="bookquote">``Maybe we should go. I mean, the
ringmaster will be waiting.''
 (<font color='red'><b>She</b></font>)</div>She (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) sounded tense. I wasn't sure why. Grover was eating the waxed paper off the tray now, but if
Aunty Em found that strange, she (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) didn't say anything.
<div class="bookquote">``Such beautiful gray eyes,''  (<font color='red'><b>Aunty</b></font>)</div>Aunty Em told Annabeth again. <div class="bookquote">``My, yes, it has been a long time since
I've seen gray eyes like those.''
 (<font color='red'><b>She</b></font>)</div>She (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) reached out as if to stroke Annabeth's cheek, but Annabeth stood up abruptly.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``We really should go.''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``Yes!''  (<font color='red'><b>Grover/Grover Underwood/GROVER</b></font>)</div>Grover swallowed his (<font color='blue'><b>Grover</b></font>) waxed paper and stood up. <div class="bookquote">``The ringmaster is waiting! Right!''
 (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div>I didn't want to leave. I felt full and content. Aunty Em was so nice. I wanted to stay with her (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) a
while.
<div class="bookquote">``Please, dears,''  (<font color='red'><b>Aunty</b></font>)</div>Aunty Em pleaded. <div class="bookquote">``I so rarely get to be with children. Before you go, won't you
at least sit for a pose?''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``A pose?''  (<font color='red'><b>Annabeth/ANNABETH</b></font>)</div>Annabeth asked warily.
<div class="bookquote">``A photograph. I will use it to model a new statue set. Children are so popular, you see. Everyone
loves children.''
 (<font color='red'><b>Annabeth/ANNABETH</b></font>)</div>Annabeth shifted her (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) weight from foot to foot. ``I don't think we can, ma’am. Come on, Percy-``
<div class="bookquote">``Sure we can,''  (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div>I said. I was irritated with Annabeth for being so bossy, so rude to an old lady
who'd just fed us for free. <div class="bookquote">``It's just a photo, Annabeth. What's the harm?''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``Yes, Annabeth,''  (<font color='red'><b>the woman</b></font>)</div>the woman purred. <div class="bookquote">``No harm.''
 (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div>I could tell Annabeth didn't like it, but she (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) allowed Aunty Em to lead us back out the front door,
into the garden of statues.
Aunty Em directed us to a park bench next to the stone satyr. <div class="bookquote">``Now,''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) said, <div class="bookquote">``I'll just position
you correctly. The young girl in the middle, I think, and the two young gentlemen on either side.''
 (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``Not much light for a photo,''  (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div>I remarked.
<div class="bookquote">``Oh, enough,''  (<font color='red'><b>Aunty</b></font>)</div>Aunty Em said. <div class="bookquote">``Enough for us to see each other, yes?''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``Where's your camera?''  (<font color='red'><b>Grover/Grover Underwood/GROVER</b></font>)</div>Grover asked.
Aunty Em stepped back, as if to admire the shot. <div class="bookquote">``Now, the face is the most difficult. Can you
smile for me please, everyone? A large smile?''
 (<font color='red'><b>Grover/Grover Underwood/GROVER</b></font>)</div>Grover glanced at the cement satyr next to him (<font color='blue'><b>Grover</b></font>), and mumbled, <div class="bookquote">``That sure does look like Uncle
Ferdinand.''
 (<font color='red'><b>him</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``Grover,''  (<font color='red'><b>Aunty</b></font>)</div>Aunty Em chastised, <div class="bookquote">``look this way, dear.''
 (<font color='red'><b>Aunty</b></font>)</div>She (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) still had no camera in her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) hands.
<div class="bookquote">``Percy-''  (<font color='red'><b>Annabeth/ANNABETH</b></font>)</div>Annabeth said.
Some instinct warned me to listen to Annabeth, but I was fighting the sleepy feeling, the
comfortable lull that came from the food and the old lady's voice.
<div class="bookquote">``I will just be a moment,''  (<font color='red'><b>Aunty</b></font>)</div>Aunty Em said. <div class="bookquote">``You know, I can't see you very well in this cursed
veil....''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``Percy, something's wrong,''  (<font color='red'><b>Annabeth/ANNABETH</b></font>)</div>Annabeth insisted.
<div class="bookquote">``Wrong?''  (<font color='red'><b>Aunty Em</b></font>)</div>Aunty Em said, reaching up to undo the wrap around her (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) head. <div class="bookquote">``Not at all, dear. I have
such noble company tonight. What could be wrong?''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``That is Uncle Ferdinand!''  (<font color='red'><b>Grover/Grover Underwood/GROVER</b></font>)</div>Grover gasped.
<div class="bookquote">``Look away from her (<font color='blue'><b>You</b></font>)!''  (<font color='red'><b>Annabeth/ANNABETH</b></font>)</div>Annabeth shouted. She (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) whipped her (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) Yankees cap onto her (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) head and
vanished. Her (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) invisible hands pushed Grover and me both off the bench.
I was on the ground, looking at Aunt Em's sandaled feet.
I could hear Grover scrambling off in one direction, Annabeth in another. But I was too dazed to
move.
Then I heard a strange, rasping sound above me. My eyes rose to Aunty Em's hands, which had
turned gnarled and warty, with sharp bronze talons for fingernails.
I almost looked higher, but somewhere off to my left Annabeth screamed, <div class="bookquote">``No! Don't!''
 (<font color='red'><b>Annabeth/ANNABETH</b></font>)</div>More rasping-the sound of tiny snakes, right above me, from ... from about where Aunty Em's
head would be.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Run!''  (<font color='red'><b>Grover/Grover Underwood/GROVER</b></font>)</div>Grover bleated. I heard him (<font color='blue'><b>Grover</b></font>) racing across the gravel, yelling, <div class="bookquote">``Maia!''  (<font color='red'><b>him</b></font>)</div>to kick-start his (<font color='blue'><b>Grover</b></font>)
flying sneakers.
I couldn't move. I stared at Aunty Em's gnarled claws, and tried to fight the groggy trance the old
woman had put me in.
<div class="bookquote">``Such a pity to destroy a handsome young face,''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) told me soothingly. <div class="bookquote">``Stay with me, Percy. All
you have to do is look up.''
 (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div>I fought the urge to obey. Instead I looked to one side and saw one of those glass spheres people
put in gardens- a gazing ball. I could see Aunty Em's dark reflection in the orange glass; her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>)
headdress was gone, revealing her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) face as a shimmering pale circle. Her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) hair was moving, writhing
like serpents.
Aunty Em.
Aunty <div class="bookquote">``M.''
 (<font color='red'><b>Aunty</b></font>)</div>How could I have been so stupid?
Think, I told myself. How did Medusa die in the myth?
But I couldn't think. Something told me that in the myth Medusa had been asleep when she (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) was
attacked by my namesake, Perseus. She (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) wasn't anywhere near asleep now. If she (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) wanted, she (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) could
take those talons right now and rake open my face.
<div class="bookquote">``The Gray-Eyed One did this to me, Percy,''  (<font color='red'><b>Medusa</b></font>)</div>Medusa said, and she (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) didn't sound anything like a
monster. Her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) voice invited me to look up, to sympathize with a poor old grandmother. <div class="bookquote">``Annabeth's

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``Don't listen to her (<font color='blue'><b>Athena</b></font>)!''  (<font color='red'><b>Annabeth/ANNABETH</b></font>)</div>Annabeth's voice shouted, somewhere in the statuary. <div class="bookquote">``Run, Percy!''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``Silence!''  (<font color='red'><b>Medusa</b></font>)</div>Medusa snarled. Then her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) voice modulated back to a comforting purr. <div class="bookquote">``You see why I
must destroy the girl, Percy. She (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) is my enemy's daughter. I shall crush her (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) statue to dust. But you, dear
Percy, you need not suffer.''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``No,''  (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div>I muttered. I tried to make my legs move.
<div class="bookquote">``Do you really want to help the gods?''  (<font color='red'><b>Medusa</b></font>)</div>Medusa asked. <div class="bookquote">``Do you understand what awaits you on
this foolish quest, Percy? What will happen if you reach the Underworld? Do not be a pawn of the
Olympians, my dear. You would be better off as a statue. Less pain. Less pain.''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``Percy!''  (<font color='red'><b>me</b></font>)</div>Behind me, I heard a buzzing sound, like a two-hundred-pound hummingbird in a
nosedive. Grover yelled, <div class="bookquote">``Duck!''
 (<font color='red'><b>Grover/Grover Underwood/GROVER</b></font>)</div>I turned, and there he (<font color='blue'><b>Grover</b></font>) was in the night sky, flying in from twelve o’clock with his (<font color='blue'><b>Grover</b></font>) winged shoes
fluttering, Grover, holding a tree branch the size of a baseball bat. His (<font color='blue'><b>Grover</b></font>) eyes were shut tight, his (<font color='blue'><b>Grover</b></font>) head
twitched from side to side. He (<font color='blue'><b>Grover</b></font>) was navigating by ears and nose alone.
<div class="bookquote">``Duck!''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Grover</b></font>) yelled again. <div class="bookquote">``I'll get her (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>)!''
 (<font color='red'><b>me</b></font>)</div>That finally jolted me into action. Knowing Grover, I was sure he (<font color='blue'><b>Grover</b></font>)'d miss Medusa and nail me. I
dove to one side.
Thwack!
At first I figured it was the sound of Grover hitting a tree. Then Medusa roared with rage.
<div class="bookquote">``You miserable satyr,''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Grover</b></font>) snarled. <div class="bookquote">``I'll add you to my collection!''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``That was for Uncle Ferdinand!''  (<font color='red'><b>Grover/Grover Underwood/GROVER</b></font>)</div>Grover yelled back.
I scrambled away and hid in the statuary while Grover swooped down for another pass.
Ker-whack!
<div class="bookquote">``Arrgh!''  (<font color='red'><b>Medusa</b></font>)</div>Medusa yelled, her (<font color='blue'><b>Grover</b></font>) snake-hair hissing and spitting.
Right next to me, Annabeth's voice said, <div class="bookquote">``Percy!''
 (<font color='red'><b>Annabeth/ANNABETH</b></font>)</div>I jumped so high my feet nearly cleared a garden gnome. <div class="bookquote">``Jeez! Don't do that!''

 (<font color='red'><b>Annabeth/ANNABETH</b></font>)</div><p/>Annabeth took off her (<font color='blue'><b>Grover</b></font>) Yankees cap and became visible. `You have to cut her (<font color='blue'><b>Grover</b></font>) head off.''
``What? Are you crazy? Let's get out of here.''
``Medusa is a menace. She (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>)'s evil. I'd kill her (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) myself, but...'' Annabeth swallowed, as if she (<font color='blue'><b>Grover</b></font>) were
about to make a difficult admission. ``But you've got the better weapon. Besides, I'd never get close
to her (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>). She (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>)'d slice me to bits because of my mother. You-you've got a chance.''
``What? I can't-``
``Look, do you want her (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) turning more innocent people into statues?''
She (<font color='blue'><b>Grover</b></font>) pointed to a pair of statue lovers, a man and a woman with their arms around each other,
turned to stone by the monster.
Annabeth grabbed a green gazing ball from a nearby pedestal. ``A polished shield would be
better.'' She (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) studied the sphere critically. ``The convexity will cause some distortion. The reflection's
size should be off by a factor of-``
``Would you speak English?''
``I am!'' She (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) tossed me the glass ball. ``Just look at her (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) in the glass. Never look at her (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) directly.''
``Hey, guys!'' Grover yelled somewhere above us. ``I think she (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>)'s unconscious!''
``Roooaaarrr!''
``Maybe not,'' Grover corrected. He (<font color='blue'><b>Grover</b></font>) went in for another pass with the tree branch.
``Hurry,'' Annabeth told me. ``Grover's got a great nose, but he (<font color='blue'><b>Grover</b></font>)'ll eventually crash.''
I took out my pen and uncapped it. The bronze blade of Riptide elongated in my hand.
I followed the hissing and spitting sounds of Medusa's hair.
I kept my eyes locked on the gazing ball so I would only glimpse Medusa's reflection, not the real
thing. Then, in the green tinted glass, I saw her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>).
Grover was coming in for another turn at bat, but this time he (<font color='blue'><b>Grover</b></font>) flew a little too low. Medusa
grabbed the stick and pulled him (<font color='blue'><b>Grover</b></font>) off course. He (<font color='blue'><b>Grover</b></font>) tumbled through the air and crashed into the arms of a
stone grizzly bear with a painful ``Ummphh!''
Medusa was about to lunge at him (<font color='blue'><b>Grover</b></font>) when I yelled, ``Hey!''
I advanced on her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>), which wasn't easy, holding a sword and a glass ball. If she (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) charged, I'd have a
hard time defending myself.
But she (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) let me approach-twenty feet, ten feet.
I could see the reflection of her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) face now. Surely it wasn't really that ugly. The green swirls of the
gazing ball must be distorting it, making it look worse.
``You wouldn't harm an old woman, Percy,'' she (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) crooned. ``I know you wouldn't.''
I hesitated, fascinated by the face I saw reflected in the glass-the eyes that seemed to burn straight
through the green tint, making my arms go weak.
From the cement grizzly, Grover moaned, ``Percy, don't listen to her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>)!''
Medusa cackled. ``Too late.''
She (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) lunged at me with her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) talons.
I slashed up with my sword, heard a sickening shlock!, then a hiss like wind rushing out of a
cavern-the sound of a monster disintegrating.
Something fell to the ground next to my foot. It took all my willpower not to look. I could feel
warm ooze soaking into my sock, little dying snake heads tugging at my shoelaces.
``Oh, yuck,'' Grover said. His (<font color='blue'><b>Grover</b></font>) eyes were still tightly closed, but I guess he (<font color='blue'><b>Grover</b></font>) could hear the thing
gurgling and steaming. ``Mega-yuck.''
Annabeth came up next to me, her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) eyes fixed on the sky. She (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) was holding Medusa's black veil.
She (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) said, <div class="bookquote">``Don't move.''

 (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div><p/>Very, very carefully, without looking down, she (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) knelt and draped the monster's head in black
cloth, then picked it up. It was still dripping green juice.
<div class="bookquote">``Are you okay?''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) asked me, her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) voice trembling.
<div class="bookquote">``Yeah,''  (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div>I decided, though I felt like throwing up my double cheeseburger. <div class="bookquote">``Why didn't ... why
didn't the head evaporate?''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``Once you sever it, it becomes a spoil of war,''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) said. <div class="bookquote">``Same as your minotaur horn. But don't
unwrap the head. It can still petrify you.''
 (<font color='red'><b>Grover/Grover Underwood/GROVER</b></font>)</div>Grover moaned as he (<font color='blue'><b>Grover</b></font>) climbed down from the grizzly statue. He (<font color='blue'><b>Grover</b></font>) had a big welt on his (<font color='blue'><b>Grover</b></font>) forehead.
His (<font color='blue'><b>Grover</b></font>) green rasta cap hung from one of his (<font color='blue'><b>Grover</b></font>) little goat horns, and his (<font color='blue'><b>Grover</b></font>) fake feet had been knocked off his (<font color='blue'><b>Grover</b></font>)
hooves. The magic sneakers were flying aimlessly around his (<font color='blue'><b>Grover</b></font>) head.
<div class="bookquote">``The Red Baron,''  (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div>I said. <div class="bookquote">``Good job, man.''
 (<font color='red'><b>He</b></font>)</div>He (<font color='blue'><b>Grover</b></font>) managed a bashful grin. <div class="bookquote">``That really was not fun, though. Well, the hitting-her-with-a-stick
part, that was fun. But crashing into a concrete bear? Not fun.''
 (<font color='red'><b>He</b></font>)</div>He (<font color='blue'><b>Grover</b></font>) snatched his (<font color='blue'><b>Grover</b></font>) shoes out of the air. I recapped my sword. Together, the three of us stumbled back
to the warehouse.
We found some old plastic grocery bags behind the snack counter and double-wrapped Medusa's
head. We plopped it on the table where we'd eaten dinner and sat around it, too exhausted to speak.
Finally I said, <div class="bookquote">``So we have Athena to thank for this monster?''
 (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div>Annabeth flashed me an irritated look. <div class="bookquote">``Your dad, actually. Don't you remember? Medusa was
Poseidon's girlfriend. They decided to meet in my mother's temple. That's why Athena turned her (<font color='blue'><b>Athena</b></font>)
into a monster. Medusa and her (<font color='blue'><b>Athena</b></font>) two sisters who had helped her (<font color='blue'><b>Athena</b></font>) get into the temple, they became the
three gorgons. That's why Medusa wanted to slice me up, but she (<font color='blue'><b>Athena</b></font>) wanted to preserve you as a nice
statue. She (<font color='blue'><b>Athena</b></font>)'s still sweet on your dad. You probably reminded her (<font color='blue'><b>Athena</b></font>) of him (<font color='blue'><b>dad</b></font>).''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>My face was burning. <div class="bookquote">``Oh, so now it's my fault we met Medusa.''
 (<font color='red'><b>Annabeth/ANNABETH</b></font>)</div>Annabeth straightened. In a bad imitation of my voice, she (<font color='blue'><b>Grover</b></font>) said: ```It's just a photo, Annabeth.
What's the harm?'''
<div class="bookquote">``Forget it,''  (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div>I said. <div class="bookquote">``You're impossible.''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``You're insufferable.''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>``You're-``
<div class="bookquote">``Hey!''  (<font color='red'><b>Grover/Grover Underwood/GROVER</b></font>)</div>Grover interrupted. <div class="bookquote">``You two are giving me a migraine, and satyrs don't even get
migraines. What are we going to do with the head?''
 (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div>I stared at the thing. One little snake was hanging out of a hole in the plastic. The words printed on
the side of the bag said: WE APPRECIATE YOUR BUSINESS!
I was angry, not just with Annabeth or her (<font color='blue'><b>Grover</b></font>) mom, but with all the gods for this whole quest, for
getting us blown off the road and in two major fights the very first day out from camp. At this rate,
we'd never make it to L.A. alive, much less before the summer solstice.
What had Medusa said?
Do not be a pawn of the Olympians, my dear. You would be better off as a statue.
I got up. <div class="bookquote">``I'll be back.''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``Percy,''  (<font color='red'><b>Annabeth/ANNABETH</b></font>)</div>Annabeth called after me. ``What are you-``
I searched the back of the warehouse until I found Medusa's office. Her (<font color='blue'><b>You</b></font>) account book showed her (<font color='blue'><b>You</b></font>)
six most recent sales, all shipments to the Underworld to decorate Hades and Persephone's garden.
According to one freight bill, the Underworld's billing address was DOA Recording Studios, West
Hollywood, California. I folded up the bill and stuffed it in my pocket.
In the cash register I found twenty dollars, a few golden drachmas, and some packing slips for

<p/>Hermes Overnight Express, each with a little leather bag attached for coins. I rummaged around the
rest of the office until I found the right-size box.
I went back to the picnic table, packed up Medusa's head, and filled out a delivery slip:
The Gods
Mount Olympus
600th Floor,
Empire State Building
New York, NY
With best wishes,
PERCY JACKSON
<div class="bookquote">``They're not going to like that,''  (<font color='red'><b>Percy/Percy Jackson/Jackson</b></font>)</div>Grover warned. <div class="bookquote">``They'll think you're impertinent.''
 (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div>I poured some golden drachmas in the pouch. As soon as I closed it, there was a sound like a cash
register. The package floated off the table and disappeared with a pop!
<div class="bookquote">``I am impertinent,''  (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div>I said.
I looked at Annabeth, daring her (<font color='blue'><b>Olympians</b></font>) to criticize.
She (<font color='blue'><b>Olympians</b></font>) didn't. She (<font color='blue'><b>Olympians</b></font>) seemed resigned to the fact that I had a major talent for ticking off the gods.
<div class="bookquote">``Come on,''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Olympians</b></font>) muttered. <div class="bookquote">``We need a new plan.''

12 WE GET ADVICE
FROM A POODLE
We were pretty miserable that night.
We camped out in the woods, a hundred yards from the main road, in a marshy clearing that local
kids had obviously been using for parties. The ground was littered with flattened soda cans and fastfood wrappers.
We'd taken some food and blankets from Aunty Em's, but we didn't dare light a fire to dry our
damp clothes. The Furies and Medusa had provided enough excitement for one day. We didn't want
to attract anything else.
We decided to sleep in shifts. I volunteered to take first watch.
Annabeth curled up on the blankets and was snoring as soon as her (<font color='blue'><b>Aunty</b></font>) head hit the ground. Grover
fluttered with his (<font color='blue'><b>Grover</b></font>) flying shoes to the lowest bough of a tree, put his (<font color='blue'><b>Grover</b></font>) back to the trunk, and stared at the
night sky.
<div class="bookquote">``Go ahead and sleep,''  (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div>I told him (<font color='blue'><b>Grover</b></font>). <div class="bookquote">``I'll wake you if there's trouble.''
 (<font color='red'><b>He</b></font>)</div>He (<font color='blue'><b>Grover</b></font>) nodded, but still didn't close his (<font color='blue'><b>Grover</b></font>) eyes. <div class="bookquote">``It makes me sad, Percy.''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``What does? The fact that you signed up for this stupid quest?''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``No. This makes me sad.''  (<font color='red'><b>He</b></font>)</div>He (<font color='blue'><b>Grover</b></font>) pointed at all the garbage on the ground. <div class="bookquote">``And the sky. You can't
even see the stars. They've polluted the sky. This is a terrible time to be a satyr.''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``Oh, yeah. I guess you'd be an environmentalist.''
 (<font color='red'><b>He</b></font>)</div>He (<font color='blue'><b>Grover</b></font>) glared at me. <div class="bookquote">``Only a human wouldn't be. Your species is clogging up the world so fast ... ah,
never mind. It's useless to lecture a human. At the rate things are going, I'll never find Pan.''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``Pam? Like the cooking spray?''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``Pan!''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Grover</b></font>) cried indignantly. <div class="bookquote">``P-A-N. The great god Pan! What do you think I want a searcher's
license for?''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>A strange breeze rustled through the clearing, temporarily overpowering the stink of trash and
muck. It brought the smell of berries and wildflowers and clean rainwater, things that might've once
been in these woods. Suddenly I was nostalgic for something I'd never known.
<div class="bookquote">``Tell me about the search,''  (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div>I said.
Grover looked at me cautiously, as if he (<font color='blue'><b>Grover</b></font>) were afraid I was just making fun.
<div class="bookquote">``The God of Wild Places disappeared two thousand years ago,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Grover</b></font>) told me. <div class="bookquote">``A sailor off the
coast of Ephesos heard a mysterious voice crying out from the shore, `Tell them that the great god Pan
has died!' When humans heard the news, they believed it. They've been pillaging Pan's kingdom ever
since. But for the satyrs, Pan was our lord and master. He (<font color='blue'><b>master</b></font>) protected us and the wild places of the
earth. We refuse to believe that he (<font color='blue'><b>master</b></font>) died. In every generation, the bravest satyrs pledge their lives to
finding Pan. They search the earth, exploring all the wildest places, hoping to find where he (<font color='blue'><b>master</b></font>) is hidden,
and wake him (<font color='blue'><b>master</b></font>) from his (<font color='blue'><b>master</b></font>) sleep.''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``And you want to be a searcher.''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``It's my life's dream,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Grover</b></font>) said. ``My father was a searcher. And my Uncle Ferdinand ... the statue
you saw back there-``
<div class="bookquote">``Oh, right, sorry.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Grover/Grover Underwood/GROVER</b></font>)</div><p/>Grover shook his (<font color='blue'><b>Grover</b></font>) head. <div class="bookquote">``Uncle Ferdinand knew the risks. So did my dad. But I'll succeed. I'll be
the first searcher to return alive.''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``Hang on-the first?''
 (<font color='red'><b>Grover/Grover Underwood/GROVER</b></font>)</div>Grover took his (<font color='blue'><b>Grover</b></font>) reed pipes out of his (<font color='blue'><b>Grover</b></font>) pocket. <div class="bookquote">``No searcher has ever come back. Once they set out,
they disappear. They're never seen alive again.''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``Not once in two thousand years?''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``No.''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``And your dad? You have no idea what happened to him (<font color='blue'><b>dad</b></font>)?''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``None.''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``But you still want to go,''  (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div>I said, amazed. <div class="bookquote">``I mean, you really think you'll be the one to find Pan?''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``I have to believe that, Percy. Every searcher does. It's the only thing that keeps us from despair
when we look at what humans have done to the world. I have to believe Pan can still be awakened.''
 (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div>I stared at the orange haze of the sky and tried to understand how Grover could pursue a dream
that seemed so hopeless. Then again, was I any better?
<div class="bookquote">``How are we going to get into the Underworld?''  (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div>I asked him (<font color='blue'><b>Grover</b></font>). <div class="bookquote">``I mean, what chance do we have
against a god?''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``I don't know,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Grover</b></font>) admitted. ``But back at Medusa's, when you were searching her (<font color='blue'><b>Percy</b></font>) office?
Annabeth was telling me-``
<div class="bookquote">``Oh, I forgot. Annabeth will have a plan all figured out.''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``Don't be so hard on her (<font color='blue'><b>Percy</b></font>), Percy. She (<font color='blue'><b>Percy</b></font>)'s had a tough life, but she (<font color='blue'><b>Percy</b></font>)'s a good person. After all, she (<font color='blue'><b>Percy</b></font>)
forgave me....''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>His (<font color='blue'><b>Grover</b></font>) voice faltered.
<div class="bookquote">``What do you mean?''  (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div>I asked. <div class="bookquote">``Forgave you for what?''
 (<font color='red'><b>Grover/Grover Underwood/GROVER</b></font>)</div>Suddenly, Grover seemed very interested in playing notes on his (<font color='blue'><b>Grover</b></font>) pipes.
<div class="bookquote">``Wait a minute,''  (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div>I said. ``Your first keeper job was five years ago. Annabeth has been at camp
five years. She (<font color='blue'><b>Percy</b></font>) wasn't ... I mean, your first assignment that went wrong-``
<div class="bookquote">``I can't talk about it,''  (<font color='red'><b>Grover/Grover Underwood/GROVER</b></font>)</div>Grover said, and his (<font color='blue'><b>Grover</b></font>) quivering lower lip suggested he (<font color='blue'><b>Grover</b></font>)'d start crying if I
pressed him (<font color='blue'><b>Grover</b></font>). <div class="bookquote">``But as I was saying, back at Medusa's, Annabeth and I agreed there's something
strange going on with this quest. Something isn't what it seems.''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``Well, duh. I'm getting blamed for stealing a thunderbolt that Hades took.''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``That's not what I mean,''  (<font color='red'><b>Grover/Grover Underwood/GROVER</b></font>)</div>Grover said. <div class="bookquote">``The Fur-The Kindly Ones were sort of holding back.
Like Mrs. Dodds at Yancy Academy ... why did she (<font color='blue'><b>Dodds</b></font>) wait so long to try to kill you? Then on the bus,
they just weren't as aggressive as they could've been.''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``They seemed plenty aggressive to me.''
 (<font color='red'><b>Grover/Grover Underwood/GROVER</b></font>)</div>Grover shook his (<font color='blue'><b>Grover</b></font>) head. ``They were screeching at us: `Where is it? Where?'''
``Asking about me,'' I said.
``Maybe ... but Annabeth and I, we both got the feeling they weren't asking about a person. They
said `Where is it?' They seemed to be asking about an object.''
``That doesn't make sense.''
``I know. But if we've misunderstood something about this quest, and we only have nine days to
find the master bolt....'' He (<font color='blue'><b>Grover</b></font>) looked at me like he (<font color='blue'><b>Grover</b></font>) was hoping for answers, but I didn't have any.
I thought about what Medusa had said: I was being used by the gods. What lay ahead of me was
worse than petrification. ``I haven't been straight with you,'' 1 told Grover. ``I don't care about the
master bolt. I agreed to go to the Underworld so I could bring back my mother.''
Grover blew a soft note on his (<font color='blue'><b>Grover</b></font>) pipes. <div class="bookquote">``I know that, Percy. But are you sure that's the only
reason?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I'm not doing it to help my father. He (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) doesn't care about me. I don't care about him (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>).''
 (<font color='red'><b>Grover/Grover Underwood/GROVER</b></font>)</div>Grover gazed down from his (<font color='blue'><b>Grover</b></font>) tree branch. <div class="bookquote">``Look, Percy, I'm not as smart as Annabeth. I'm not as
brave as you. But I'm pretty good at reading emotions. You're glad your dad is alive. You feel good
that he (<font color='blue'><b>dad</b></font>)'s claimed you, and part of you wants to make him (<font color='blue'><b>dad</b></font>) proud. That's why you mailed Medusa's
head to Olympus. You wanted him (<font color='blue'><b>dad</b></font>) to notice what you'd done.''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``Yeah? Well maybe satyr emotions work differently than human emotions. Because you're wrong.
I don't care what he (<font color='blue'><b>dad</b></font>) thinks.''
 (<font color='red'><b>Grover/Grover Underwood/GROVER</b></font>)</div>Grover pulled his (<font color='blue'><b>Grover</b></font>) feet up onto the branch. <div class="bookquote">``Okay, Percy. Whatever.''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``Besides, I haven't done anything worth bragging about. We barely got out of New York and
we're stuck here with no money and no way west.''
 (<font color='red'><b>Grover/Grover Underwood/GROVER</b></font>)</div>Grover looked at the night sky, like he (<font color='blue'><b>Grover</b></font>) was thinking about that problem. <div class="bookquote">``How about I take first
watch, huh? You get some sleep.''
 (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div>I wanted to protest, but he (<font color='blue'><b>Grover</b></font>) started to play Mozart, soft and sweet, and I turned away, my eyes
stinging. After a few bars of Piano Concerto no. 12, I was asleep.
In my dreams, I stood in a dark cavern before a gaping pit. Gray mist creatures churned all around
me, whispering rags of smoke that I somehow knew were the spirits of the dead.
They tugged at my clothes, trying to pull me back, but I felt compelled to walk forward to the very
edge of the chasm.
Looking down made me dizzy.
The pit yawned so wide and was so completely black, I knew it must be bottomless. Yet I had a
feeling that something was trying to rise from the abyss, something huge and evil.
The little hero, an amused voice echoed far down in the darkness. Too weak, too young, but
perhaps you will do.
The voice felt ancient-cold and heavy. It wrapped around me like sheets of lead.
They have misled you, boy, it said. Barter with me. I will give you what you want.
A shimmering image hovered over the void: my mother, frozen at the moment she (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>)'d dissolved in a
shower of gold. Her (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) face was distorted with pain, as if the Minotaur were still squeezing her (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) neck.
Her (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) eyes looked directly at me, pleading: Go!
I tried to cry out, but my voice wouldn't work.
Cold laughter echoed from the chasm.
An invisible force pulled me forward. It would drag me into the pit unless I stood firm.
Help me rise, boy. The voice became hungrier. Bring me the bolt. Strike a blow against the
treacherous gods!
The spirits of the dead whispered around me, No! Wake!
The image of my mother began to fade. The thing in the pit tightened its unseen grip around me.
I realized it wasn't interested in pulling me in. It was using me to pull itself out.
Good, it murmured. Good.
Wake! the dead whispered. Wake!
Someone was shaking me.
My eyes opened, and it was daylight.
<div class="bookquote">``Well,''  (<font color='red'><b>Annabeth/ANNABETH</b></font>)</div>Annabeth said, <div class="bookquote">``the zombie lives.''
 (<font color='red'><b>Annabeth/ANNABETH</b></font>)</div>I was trembling from the dream. I could still feel the grip of the chasm monster around my chest.
<div class="bookquote">``How long was I asleep?''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``Long enough for me to cook breakfast.''  (<font color='red'><b>Annabeth/ANNABETH</b></font>)</div>Annabeth tossed me a bag of nacho-flavored corn chips
from Aunty Em's snack bar. <div class="bookquote">``And Grover went exploring. Look, he (<font color='blue'><b>Grover</b></font>) found a friend.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/>My eyes had trouble focusing.
Grover was sitting cross-legged on a blanket with something fuzzy in his (<font color='blue'><b>Grover</b></font>) lap, a dirty, unnaturally
pink stuffed animal.
No. It wasn't a stuffed animal. It was a pink poodle.
The poodle yapped at me suspiciously. Grover said, <div class="bookquote">``No, he (<font color='blue'><b>Grover</b></font>)'s not.''
 (<font color='red'><b>Grover/Grover Underwood/GROVER</b></font>)</div>I blinked. <div class="bookquote">``Are you ... talking to that thing?''
 (<font color='red'><b>The poodle</b></font>)</div>The poodle growled.
<div class="bookquote">``This thing,''  (<font color='red'><b>Grover/Grover Underwood/GROVER</b></font>)</div>Grover warned, <div class="bookquote">``is our ticket west. Be nice to him (<font color='blue'><b>Grover</b></font>).''
 (<font color='red'><b>Grover/Grover Underwood/GROVER</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``You can talk to animals?''
 (<font color='red'><b>Grover/Grover Underwood/GROVER</b></font>)</div>Grover ignored the question. <div class="bookquote">``Percy, meet Gladiola. Gladiola, Percy.''
 (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div>I stared at Annabeth, figuring she (<font color='blue'><b>poodle</b></font>)'d crack up at this practical joke they were playing on me, but
she (<font color='blue'><b>poodle</b></font>) looked deadly serious.
<div class="bookquote">``I'm not saying hello to a pink poodle,''  (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div>I said. <div class="bookquote">``Forget it.''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``Percy,''  (<font color='red'><b>Annabeth/ANNABETH</b></font>)</div>Annabeth said. <div class="bookquote">``I said hello to the poodle. You say hello to the poodle.''
 (<font color='red'><b>The poodle</b></font>)</div>The poodle growled.
I said hello to the poodle.
Grover explained that he (<font color='blue'><b>Grover</b></font>)'d come across Gladiola in the woods and they'd struck up a
conversation. The poodle had run away from a rich local family, who'd posted a $200 reward for his (<font color='blue'><b>Grover</b></font>)
return. Gladiola didn't really want to go back to his (<font color='blue'><b>Grover</b></font>) family, but he (<font color='blue'><b>Grover</b></font>) was willing to if it meant helping
Grover.
<div class="bookquote">``How does Gladiola know about the reward?''  (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div>I asked.
<div class="bookquote">``He (<font color='blue'><b>Percy</b></font>) read the signs,''  (<font color='red'><b>Grover/Grover Underwood/GROVER</b></font>)</div>Grover said. <div class="bookquote">``Duh.''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``Of course,''  (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div>I said. <div class="bookquote">``Silly me.''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``So we turn in Gladiola,''  (<font color='red'><b>Annabeth/ANNABETH</b></font>)</div>Annabeth explained in her (<font color='blue'><b>poodle</b></font>) best strategy voice, <div class="bookquote">``we get money, and we
buy tickets to Los Angeles. Simple.''
 (<font color='red'><b>Annabeth/ANNABETH</b></font>)</div>I thought about my dream-the whispering voices of the dead, the thing in the chasm, and my
mother's face, shimmering as it dissolved into gold. All that might be waiting for me in the West.
<div class="bookquote">``Not another bus,''  (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div>I said warily.
<div class="bookquote">``No,''  (<font color='red'><b>Annabeth/ANNABETH</b></font>)</div>Annabeth agreed.
She (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) pointed downhill, toward train tracks I hadn't been able to see last night in the dark. <div class="bookquote">``There's
an Amtrak station half a mile that way. According to Gladiola, the westbound train leaves at noon.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Percy/Percy Jackson/Jackson</b></font>)</div><p/>Percy Jackson 1 - The Lightning Thief
13 I PLUNGE TO
MY DEATH
We spent two days on the Amtrak train, heading west through hills, over rivers, past amber waves
of grain.
We weren't attacked once, but I didn't relax. I felt that we were traveling around in a display
case, being watched from above and maybe from below, that something was waiting for the right
opportunity.
I tried to keep a low profile because my name and picture were splattered over the front pages of
several East Coast newspapers. The Trenton Register-News showed a photo taken by a tourist as I
got off the Greyhound bus. I had a wild look in my eyes. My sword was a metallic blur in my hands. It
might've been a baseball bat or a lacrosse stick.
The picture's caption read:
Twelve-year-old Percy Jackson, wanted for questioning in the Long Island disappearance of his (<font color='blue'><b>Jackson</b></font>)
mother two weeks ago, is shown here fleeing from the bus where he (<font color='blue'><b>Jackson</b></font>) accosted several elderly female
passengers. The bus exploded on an east New Jersey roadside shortly after Jackson fled the scene.
Based on eyewitness accounts, police believe the boy may be traveling with two teenage
accomplices. His (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>) stepfather, Gabe Ugliano, has offered a cash reward for information leading to his (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>)
capture.
<div class="bookquote">``Don't worry,''  (<font color='red'><b>Annabeth/ANNABETH</b></font>)</div>Annabeth told me. <div class="bookquote">``Mortal police could never find us.''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>But she (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) didn't sound so
sure.
The rest of the day I spent alternately pacing the length of the train -LRB-because I had a really hard
time sitting still-RRB- or looking out the windows.
Once, I spotted a family of centaurs galloping across a wheat field, bows at the ready, as they
hunted lunch. The little boy centaur, who was the size of a second-grader on a pony, caught my eye
and waved. I looked around the passenger car, but nobody else had noticed. The adult riders all had
their faces buried in laptop computers or magazines.
Another time, toward evening, I saw something huge moving through the woods. I could've sworn
it was a lion, except that lions don't live wild in America, and this thing was the size of a Hummer.
Its fur glinted gold in the evening light. Then it leaped through the trees and was gone.
Our reward money for returning Gladiola the poodle had only been enough to purchase tickets as
far as Denver. We couldn't get berths in the sleeper car, so we dozed in our seats. My neck got stiff. I
tried not to drool in my sleep, since Annabeth was sitting right next to me.
Grover kept snoring and bleating and waking me up. Once, he (<font color='blue'><b>Grover</b></font>) shuffled around and his (<font color='blue'><b>Grover</b></font>) fake foot
fell off. Annabeth and I had to stick it back on before any of the other passengers noticed.
<div class="bookquote">``So,''  (<font color='red'><b>Annabeth/ANNABETH</b></font>)</div>Annabeth asked me, once we'd gotten Grover's sneaker readjusted. <div class="bookquote">``Who wants your
help?''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``What do you mean?''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``When you were asleep just now, you mumbled, `I won't help you.' Who were you dreaming
about?''
 (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div>I was reluctant to say anything. It was the second time I'd dreamed about the evil voice from the

<p/>pit. But it bothered me so much I finally told her (<font color='blue'><b>it</b></font>).
Annabeth was quiet for a long time. <div class="bookquote">``That doesn't sound like Hades. He (<font color='blue'><b>us</b></font>) always appears on a
black throne, and he (<font color='blue'><b>us</b></font>) never laughs.''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``He (<font color='blue'><b>us</b></font>) offered my mother in trade. Who else could do that?''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``I guess ... if he (<font color='blue'><b>us</b></font>) meant, `Help me rise from the Underworld.' If he (<font color='blue'><b>us</b></font>) wants war with the Olympians.
But why ask you to bring him (<font color='blue'><b>us</b></font>) the master bolt if he (<font color='blue'><b>us</b></font>) already has it?''
 (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div>I shook my head, wishing I knew the answer. I thought about what Grover had told me, that the
Furies on the bus seemed to have been looking for something.
Where is it? Where?
Maybe Grover sensed my emotions. He (<font color='blue'><b>Grover</b></font>) snorted in his (<font color='blue'><b>Grover</b></font>) sleep, muttered something about vegetables,
and turned his (<font color='blue'><b>Grover</b></font>) head.
Annabeth readjusted his (<font color='blue'><b>Grover</b></font>) cap so it covered his (<font color='blue'><b>Grover</b></font>) horns. ``Percy, you can't barter with Hades. You
know that, right? He (<font color='blue'><b>Percy</b></font>)'s deceitful, heartless, and greedy. I don't care if his (<font color='blue'><b>Percy</b></font>) Kindly Ones weren't as
aggressive this time-``
<div class="bookquote">``This time?''  (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div>I asked. <div class="bookquote">``You mean you've run into them before?''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>Her (<font color='blue'><b>it</b></font>) hand crept up to her (<font color='blue'><b>it</b></font>) necklace. She (<font color='blue'><b>it</b></font>) fingered a glazed white bead painted with the image of a
pine tree, one of her (<font color='blue'><b>it</b></font>) clay end-of-summer tokens. <div class="bookquote">``Let's just say I've got no love for the Lord of the
Dead. You can't be tempted to make a deal for your mom.''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``What would you do if it was your dad?''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``That's easy,''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>it</b></font>) said. <div class="bookquote">``I'd leave him (<font color='blue'><b>dad</b></font>) to rot.''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``You're not serious?''
 (<font color='red'><b>Annabeth/ANNABETH</b></font>)</div>Annabeth's gray eyes fixed on me. She (<font color='blue'><b>it</b></font>) wore the same expression she (<font color='blue'><b>it</b></font>)'d worn in the woods at
camp, the moment she (<font color='blue'><b>it</b></font>) drew her (<font color='blue'><b>it</b></font>) sword against the hellhound. <div class="bookquote">``My dad's resented me since the day I
was born, Percy,''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>it</b></font>) said. <div class="bookquote">``He (<font color='blue'><b>Percy</b></font>) never wanted a baby. When he (<font color='blue'><b>Percy</b></font>) got me, he (<font color='blue'><b>Percy</b></font>) asked Athena to take me
back and raise me on Olympus because he (<font color='blue'><b>Percy</b></font>) was too busy with his (<font color='blue'><b>Percy</b></font>) work. She (<font color='blue'><b>Athena</b></font>) wasn't happy about that.
She (<font color='blue'><b>Athena</b></font>) told him (<font color='blue'><b>Percy</b></font>) heroes had to be raised by their mortal parent.''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``But how ... I mean, I guess you weren't born in a hospital....''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``I appeared on my father's doorstep, in a golden cradle, carried down from Olympus by Zephyr
the West Wind. You'd think my dad would remember that as a miracle, right? Like, maybe he (<font color='blue'><b>dad</b></font>)'d take
some digital photos or something. But he (<font color='blue'><b>dad</b></font>) always talked about my arrival as if it were the most
inconvenient thing that had ever happened to him (<font color='blue'><b>dad</b></font>). When I was five he (<font color='blue'><b>dad</b></font>) got married and totally forgot
about Athena. He (<font color='blue'><b>dad</b></font>) got a `regular' mortal wife, and had two `regular' mortal kids, and tried to pretend I
didn't exist.''
 (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div>I stared out the train window. The lights of a sleeping town were drifting by. I wanted to make
Annabeth feel better, but I didn't know how.
<div class="bookquote">``My mom married a really awful guy,''  (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div>I told her (<font color='blue'><b>it</b></font>). <div class="bookquote">``Grover said she (<font color='blue'><b>mom</b></font>) did it to protect me, to hide
me in the scent of a human family. Maybe that's what your dad was thinking.''
 (<font color='red'><b>Annabeth/ANNABETH</b></font>)</div>Annabeth kept worrying at her (<font color='blue'><b>it</b></font>) necklace. She (<font color='blue'><b>it</b></font>) was pinching the gold college ring that hung with the
beads. It occurred to me that the ring must be her (<font color='blue'><b>it</b></font>) father's. I wondered why she (<font color='blue'><b>it</b></font>) wore it if she (<font color='blue'><b>it</b></font>) hated
him (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) so much.
<div class="bookquote">``He (<font color='blue'><b>dad</b></font>) doesn't care about me,''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>it</b></font>) said. <div class="bookquote">``His (<font color='blue'><b>dad</b></font>) wife-my stepmom-treated me like a freak. She (<font color='blue'><b>mom</b></font>)
wouldn't let me play with her (<font color='blue'><b>mom</b></font>) children. My dad went along with her (<font color='blue'><b>mom</b></font>). Whenever something dangerous
happened-you know, something with monsters-they would both look at me resentfully, like, `How
dare you put our family at risk.' Finally, I took the hint. I wasn't wanted. I ran away.''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``How old were you?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Same age as when I started camp. Seven.''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``But ... you couldn't have gotten all the way to Half-Blood Hill by yourself.''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``Not alone, no. Athena watched over me, guided me toward help. I made a couple of unexpected
friends who took care of me, for a short time, anyway.''
 (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div>I wanted to ask what happened, but Annabeth seemed lost in sad memories. So I listened to the
sound of Grover snoring and gazed out the train windows as the dark fields of Ohio raced by.
Toward the end of our second day on the train, June 13, eight days before the summer solstice, we
passed through some golden hills and over the Mississippi River into St. Louis. Annabeth craned her (<font color='blue'><b>it</b></font>)
neck to see the Gateway Arch, which looked to me like a huge shopping bag handle stuck on the city.
<div class="bookquote">``I want to do that,''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>it</b></font>) sighed.
<div class="bookquote">``What?''  (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div>I asked.
<div class="bookquote">``Build something like that. You ever see the Parthenon, Percy?''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``Only in pictures.''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``Someday, I'm going to see it in person. I'm going to build the greatest monument to the gods,
ever. Something that'll last a thousand years.''
 (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div>I laughed. <div class="bookquote">``You? An architect?''
 (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div>I don't know why, but I found it funny. Just the idea of Annabeth trying to sit quietly and draw all
day.
Her (<font color='blue'><b>it</b></font>) cheeks flushed. <div class="bookquote">``Yes, an architect. Athena expects her (<font color='blue'><b>Athena</b></font>) children to create things, not just tear
them down, like a certain god of earthquakes I could mention.''
 (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div>I watched the churning brown water of the Mississippi below.
<div class="bookquote">``Sorry,''  (<font color='red'><b>Annabeth/ANNABETH</b></font>)</div>Annabeth said. <div class="bookquote">``That was mean.''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``Can't we work together a little?''  (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div>I pleaded. <div class="bookquote">``I mean, didn't Athena and Poseidon ever
cooperate?''
 (<font color='red'><b>Annabeth/ANNABETH</b></font>)</div>Annabeth had to think about it. <div class="bookquote">``I guess ... the chariot,''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>it</b></font>) said tentatively. <div class="bookquote">``My mom invented it,
but Poseidon created horses out of the crests of waves. So they had to work together to make it
complete.''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``Then we can cooperate, too. Right?''
 (<font color='red'><b>Annabeth/ANNABETH</b></font>)</div>We rode into the city, Annabeth watching as the Arch disappeared behind a hotel.
<div class="bookquote">``I suppose,''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>it</b></font>) said at last.
We pulled into the Amtrak station downtown. The intercom told us we'd have a three-hour
layover before departing for Denver.
Grover stretched. Before he (<font color='blue'><b>Grover</b></font>) was even fully awake, he (<font color='blue'><b>Grover</b></font>) said, <div class="bookquote">``Food.''
 (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``Come on, goat boy,''  (<font color='red'><b>Annabeth/ANNABETH</b></font>)</div>Annabeth said. <div class="bookquote">``Sightseeing.''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``Sightseeing?''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``The Gateway Arch,''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>it</b></font>) said. <div class="bookquote">``This may be my only chance to ride to the top. Are you coming
or not?''
 (<font color='red'><b>Grover/Grover Underwood/GROVER</b></font>)</div>Grover and I exchanged looks.
I wanted to say no, but I figured that if Annabeth was going, we couldn't very well let her (<font color='blue'><b>it</b></font>) go
alone.
Grover shrugged. <div class="bookquote">``As long as there's a snack bar without monsters.''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>The Arch was about a mile from the train station. Late in the day the lines to get in weren't that
long. We threaded our way through the underground museum, looking at covered wagons and other
junk from the 1800s. It wasn't all that thrilling, but Annabeth kept telling us interesting facts about
how the Arch was built, and Grover kept passing me jelly beans, so I was okay.

<p/>I kept looking around, though, at the other people in line. <div class="bookquote">``You smell anything?''  (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div>I murmured to
Grover.
He (<font color='blue'><b>Grover</b></font>) took his (<font color='blue'><b>Grover</b></font>) nose out of the jelly-bean bag long enough to sniff. <div class="bookquote">``Underground,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Grover</b></font>) said
distastefully. <div class="bookquote">``Underground air always smells like monsters. Probably doesn't mean anything.''
 (<font color='red'><b>me</b></font>)</div>But something felt wrong to me. I had a feeling we shouldn't be here.
<div class="bookquote">``Guys,''  (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div>I said. <div class="bookquote">``You know the gods' symbols of power?''
 (<font color='red'><b>Annabeth/ANNABETH</b></font>)</div>Annabeth had been in the middle of reading about the construction equipment used to build the
Arch, but she (<font color='blue'><b>people</b></font>) looked over. <div class="bookquote">``Yeah?''
 (<font color='red'><b>Grover/Grover Underwood/GROVER</b></font>)</div>``Well, Hade-``
Grover cleared his (<font color='blue'><b>Grover</b></font>) throat. <div class="bookquote">``We're in a public place.... You mean, our friend downstairs?''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``Um, right,''  (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div>I said. <div class="bookquote">``Our friend way downstairs. Doesn't he (<font color='blue'><b>friend</b></font>) have a hat like Annabeth's?''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``You mean the Helm of Darkness,''  (<font color='red'><b>Annabeth/ANNABETH</b></font>)</div>Annabeth said. <div class="bookquote">``Yeah, that's his (<font color='blue'><b>Helm</b></font>) symbol of power. I saw it
next to his (<font color='blue'><b>Helm</b></font>) seat during the winter solstice council meeting.''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``He (<font color='blue'><b>Helm</b></font>) was there?''  (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div>I asked.
She (<font color='blue'><b>people</b></font>) nodded. <div class="bookquote">``It's the only time he (<font color='blue'><b>Helm</b></font>)'s allowed to visit Olympus-the darkest day of the year. But his (<font color='blue'><b>Helm</b></font>)
helm is a lot more powerful than my invisibility hat, if what I've heard is true....''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``It allows him (<font color='blue'><b>Helm</b></font>) to become darkness,''  (<font color='red'><b>Grover/Grover Underwood/GROVER</b></font>)</div>Grover confirmed. <div class="bookquote">``He (<font color='blue'><b>Helm</b></font>) can melt into shadow or pass through
walls. He (<font color='blue'><b>Helm</b></font>) can't be touched, or seen, or heard. And he (<font color='blue'><b>Helm</b></font>) can radiate fear so intense it can drive you
insane or stop your heart. Why do you think all rational creatures fear the dark?''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``But then ... how do we know he (<font color='blue'><b>Helm</b></font>)'s not here right now, watching us?''  (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div>I asked.
Annabeth and Grover exchanged looks.
<div class="bookquote">``We don't,''  (<font color='red'><b>Grover/Grover Underwood/GROVER</b></font>)</div>Grover said.
<div class="bookquote">``Thanks, that makes me feel a lot better,''  (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div>I said. <div class="bookquote">``Got any blue jelly beans left?''
 (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div>I'd almost mastered my jumpy nerves when I saw the tiny little elevator car we were going to ride
to the top of the Arch, and I knew I was in trouble. I hate confined places. They make me nuts.
We got shoehorned into the car with this big fat lady and her (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) dog, a Chihuahua with a rhinestone
collar. I figured maybe the dog was a seeing-eye Chihuahua, because none of the guards said a word
about it.
We started going up, inside the Arch. I'd never been in an elevator that went in a curve, and my
stomach wasn't too happy about it.
<div class="bookquote">``No parents?''  (<font color='red'><b>the lady</b></font>)</div>the fat lady asked us.
She (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) had beady eyes; pointy, coffee-stained teeth; a floppy denim hat, and a denim dress that
bulged so much, she (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) looked like a blue-jean blimp.
<div class="bookquote">``They're below,''  (<font color='red'><b>Annabeth/ANNABETH</b></font>)</div>Annabeth told her (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>). <div class="bookquote">``Scared of heights.''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``Oh, the poor darlings.''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>The Chihuahua growled. The woman said, <div class="bookquote">``Now, now, sonny. Behave.''  (<font color='red'><b>The woman</b></font>)</div>The dog had beady eyes
like its owner, intelligent and vicious.
I said, <div class="bookquote">``Sonny. Is that his (<font color='blue'><b>Sonny</b></font>) name?''
 (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``No,''  (<font color='red'><b>the lady</b></font>)</div>the lady told me.
She (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) smiled, as if that cleared everything up.
At the top of the Arch, the observation deck reminded me of a tin can with carpeting. Rows of tiny
windows looked out over the city on one side and the river on the other. The view was okay, but if
there's anything I like less than a confined space, it's a confined space six hundred feet in the air. I
was ready to go pretty quick.
Annabeth kept talking about structural supports, and how she (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) would've made the windows bigger,

<p/>and designed a see-through floor. She (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) probably could've stayed up there for hours, but luckily for me
the park ranger announced that the observation deck would be closing in a few minutes.
I steered Grover and Annabeth toward the exit, loaded them into the elevator, and I was about to
get in myself when I realized there were already two other tourists inside. No room for me.
The park ranger said, <div class="bookquote">``Next car, sir.''
 (<font color='red'><b>The park ranger</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``We'll get out,''  (<font color='red'><b>Annabeth/ANNABETH</b></font>)</div>Annabeth said. <div class="bookquote">``We'll wait with you.''
 (<font color='red'><b>mess everybody</b></font>)</div>But that was going to mess everybody up and take even more time, so I said, <div class="bookquote">``Naw, it's okay. I'll
see you guys at the bottom.''
 (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div>Grover and Annabeth both looked nervous, but they let the elevator door slide shut. Their car
disappeared down the ramp.
Now the only people left on the observation deck were me, a little boy with his (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>) parents, the park
ranger, and the fat lady with her (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) Chihuahua.
I smiled uneasily at the fat lady. She (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) smiled back, her (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) forked tongue flickering between her (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) teeth.
Wait a minute.
Forked tongue?
Before I could decide if I'd really seen that, her (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) Chihuahua jumped down and started yapping at
me.
<div class="bookquote">``Now, now, sonny,''  (<font color='red'><b>the lady</b></font>)</div>the lady said. <div class="bookquote">``Does this look like a good time? We have all these nice
people here.''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``Doggie!''  (<font color='red'><b>the boy</b></font>)</div>said the little boy. <div class="bookquote">``Look, a doggie!''
 (<font color='red'><b>parents</b></font>)</div>His (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>) parents pulled him (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>) back.
The Chihuahua bared his (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>) teeth at me, foam dripping from his (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>) black lips.
<div class="bookquote">``Well, son,''  (<font color='red'><b>the lady</b></font>)</div>the fat lady sighed. <div class="bookquote">``If you insist.''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>Ice started forming in my stomach. <div class="bookquote">``Urn, did you just call that Chihuahua your son?''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``Chimera, dear,''  (<font color='red'><b>the lady</b></font>)</div>the fat lady corrected. <div class="bookquote">``Not a Chihuahua. It's an easy mistake to make.''
 (<font color='red'><b>She</b></font>)</div>She (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) rolled up her (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) denim sleeves, revealing that the skin of her (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) arms was scaly and green. When
she (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) smiled, I saw that her (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) teeth were fangs. The pupils of her (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) eyes were sideways slits, like a
reptile's.
The Chihuahua barked louder, and with each bark, it grew. First to the size of a Doberman, then to
a lion. The bark became a roar.
The little boy screamed. His (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>) parents pulled him (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>) back toward the exit, straight into the park ranger,
who stood, paralyzed, gaping at the monster.
The Chimera was now so tall its back rubbed against the roof. It had the head of a lion with a
blood-caked mane, the body and hooves of a giant goat, and a serpent for a tail, a ten-foot-long
diamondback growing right out of its shaggy behind. The rhinestone dog collar still hung around its
neck, and the plate-sized dog tag was now easy to read: CHIMERA-RABID, FIRE-BREATHING,
POISONOUS-IF FOUND, PLEASE CALL TARTARUS-EXT. 954.
I realized I hadn't even uncapped my sword. My hands were numb. I was ten feet away from the
Chimera's bloody maw, and I knew that as soon as I moved, the creature would lunge.
The snake lady made a hissing noise that might've been laughter. <div class="bookquote">``Be honored, Percy Jackson.
Lord Zeus rarely allows me to test a hero with one of my brood. For I am the Mother of Monsters, the
terrible Echidna!''
 (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div>I stared at her (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>). All I could think to say was: <div class="bookquote">``Isn't that a kind of anteater?''
 (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div>She (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) howled, her (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) reptilian face turning brown and green with rage. ``I hate it when people say that!
I hate Australia! Naming that ridiculous animal after me. For that, Percy Jackson, my son shall destroy

<p/>you!''
The Chimera charged, its lion teeth gnashing. I managed to leap aside and dodge the bite.
I ended up next to the family and the park ranger, who were all screaming now, trying to pry open
the emergency exit doors.
I couldn't let them get hurt. I uncapped my sword, ran to the other side of the deck, and yelled,
``Hey, Chihuahua!'' The Chimera turned faster than I would've thought possible.
Before I could swing my sword, it opened its mouth, emitting a stench like the world's largest
barbecue pit, and shot a column of flame straight at me.
I dove through the explosion. The carpet burst into flames; the heat was so intense, it nearly
seared off my eyebrows.
Where I had been standing a moment before was a ragged hole in the side of the Arch, with
melted metal steaming around the edges.
Great, I thought. We just blowtorched a national monument.
Riptide was now a shining bronze blade in my hands, and as the Chimera turned, I slashed at its
neck.
That was my fatal mistake. The blade sparked harmlessly off the dog collar. I tried to regain my
balance, but I was so worried about defending myself against the fiery lion's mouth, I completely
forgot about the serpent tail until it whipped around and sank its fangs into my calf.
My whole leg was on fire. I tried to jab Riptide into the Chimera's mouth, but the serpent tail
wrapped around my ankles and pulled me off balance, and my blade flew out of my hand, spinning out
of the hole in the Arch and down toward the Mississippi River.
I managed to get to my feet, but I knew I had lost. I was weaponless. I could feel deadly poison
racing up to my chest. I remembered Chiron saying that Anaklusmos would always return to me, but
there was no pen in my pocket. Maybe it had fallen too far away. Maybe it only returned when it was
in pen form. I didn't know, and I wasn't going to live long enough to figure it out.
I backed into the hole in the wall. The Chimera advanced, growling, smoke curling from its lips.
The snake lady, Echidna, cackled. ``They don't make heroes like they used to, eh, son?''
The monster growled. It seemed in no hurry to finish me off now that I was beaten.
I glanced at the park ranger and the family. The little boy was hiding behind his (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>) father's legs. I
had to protect these people. I couldn't just ... die. I tried to think, but my whole body was on fire. My
head felt dizzy. I had no sword. I was facing a massive, fire-breathing monster and its mother. And I
was scared.
There was no place else to go, so I stepped to the edge of the hole. Far, far below, the river
glittered.
If I died, would the monsters go away? Would they leave the humans alone?
``If you are the son of Poseidon,'' Echidna hissed, ``you would not fear water. Jump, Percy
Jackson. Show me that water will not harm you. Jump and retrieve your sword. Prove your
bloodline.''
Yeah, right, I thought. I'd read somewhere that jumping into water from a couple of stories up was
like jumping onto solid asphalt. From here, I'd splatter on impact.
The Chimera's mouth glowed red, heating up for another blast.
``You have no faith,'' Echidna told me. <div class="bookquote">``You do not trust the gods. I cannot blame you, little
coward. Better you die now. The gods are faithless. The poison is in your heart.''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>She (<font color='blue'><b>I</b></font>) was right: I was dying. I could feel my breath slowing down. Nobody could save me, not
even the gods.

<p/>I backed up and looked down at the water. I remembered the warm glow of my father's smile
when I was a baby. He (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) must have seen me. He (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) must have visited me when I was in my cradle.
I remembered the swirling green trident that had appeared above my head the night of capture the
flag, when Poseidon had claimed me as his (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) son.
But this wasn't the sea. This was the Mississippi, dead center of the USA. There was no Sea God
here.
<div class="bookquote">``Die, faithless one,''  (<font color='red'><b>Echidna</b></font>)</div>Echidna rasped, and the Chimera sent a column of flame toward my face.
<div class="bookquote">``Father, help me,''  (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div>I prayed.
I turned and jumped. My clothes on fire, poison coursing through my veins, I plummeted toward
the river.

<p/>Percy Jackson 1 - The Lightning Thief
14 I BECOME A
KNOWN FUGITIVE
I'd love to tell you I had some deep revelation on my way down, that I came to terms with my
own mortality, laughed in the face of death, et cetera.
The truth? My only thought was: Aaaaggghhhhh!
The river raced toward me at the speed of a truck. Wind ripped the breath from my lungs.
Steeples and skyscrapers and bridges tumbled in and out of my vision.
And then: Flaaa-boooom!
A whiteout of bubbles. I sank through the murk, sure that I was about to end up embedded in a
hundred feet of mud and lost forever.
But my impact with the water hadn't hurt. I was falling slowly now, bubbles trickling up through
my fingers. I settled on the river bottom soundlessly. A catfish the size of my stepfather lurched away
into the gloom. Clouds of silt and disgusting garbage-beer bottles, old shoes, plastic bags-swirled up
all around me.
At that point, I realized a few things: first, I had not been flattened into a pancake. I had not been
barbecued. I couldn't even feel the Chimera poison boiling in my veins anymore. I was alive, which
was good.
Second realization: I wasn't wet. I mean, I could feel the coolness of the water. I could see where
the fire on my clothes had been quenched. But when I touched my own shirt, it felt perfectly dry.
I looked at the garbage floating by and snatched an old cigarette lighter.
No way, I thought.
I flicked the lighter. It sparked. A tiny flame appeared, right there at the bottom of the Mississippi.
I grabbed a soggy hamburger wrapper out of the current and immediately the paper turned dry. I lit
it with no problem. As soon as I let it go, the flames sputtered out. The wrapper turned back into a
slimy rag. Weird.
But the strangest thought occurred to me only last: I was breathing. I was underwater, and I was
breathing normally.
I stood up, thigh-deep in mud. My legs felt shaky. My hands trembled. I should've been dead. The
fact that I wasn't seemed like ... well, a miracle. I imagined a woman's voice, a voice that sounded a
bit like my mother: Percy, what do you say?
<div class="bookquote">``Um ... thanks.''  (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div>Underwater, I sounded like I did on recordings, like a much older kid. <div class="bookquote">``Thank
you ... Father.''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>No response. Just the dark drift of garbage downriver, the enormous catfish gliding by, the flash
of sunset on the water's surface far above, turning everything the color of butterscotch.
Why had Poseidon saved me? The more I thought about it, the more ashamed I felt. So I'd gotten
lucky a few times before. Against a thing like the Chimera, I had never stood a chance. Those poor
people in the Arch were probably toast. I couldn't protect them. I was no hero. Maybe I should just
stay down here with the catfish, join the bottom feeders.
Fump-fump-fump. A riverboat's paddlewheel churned above me, swirling the silt around.
There, not five feet in front of me, was my sword, its gleaming bronze hilt sticking up in the mud.

<p/>I heard that woman's voice again: Percy, take the sword. Your father believes in you. This time, I
knew the voice wasn't in my head. I wasn't imagining it. Her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) words seemed to come from
everywhere, rippling through the water like dolphin sonar.
<div class="bookquote">``Where are you?''  (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div>I called aloud.
Then, through the gloom, I saw her-a woman the color of the water, a ghost in the current, floating
just above the sword. She (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) had long billowing hair, and her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) eyes, barely visible, were green like mine.
A lump formed in my throat. I said, <div class="bookquote">``Mom?''
 (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div>No, child, only a messenger, though your mother's fate is not as hopeless as you believe. Go to the
beach in Santa Monica.
<div class="bookquote">``What?''
 (<font color='red'><b>father</b></font>)</div>It is your father's will. Before you descend into the Underworld, you must go to Santa Monica.
Please, Percy, I cannot stay long. The river here is too foul for my presence.
<div class="bookquote">``But ...''  (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div>I was sure this woman was my mother, or a vision of her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>), anyway. ``Who-how did you-``
There was so much I wanted to ask, the words jammed up in my throat.
I cannot stay, brave one, the woman said. She (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) reached out, and I felt the current brush my face like
a caress. You must go to Santa Monica! And, Percy, do not trust the gifts....
Her (<font color='blue'><b>Monica</b></font>) voice faded.
<div class="bookquote">``Gifts?''  (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div>I asked. <div class="bookquote">``What gifts? Wait!''
 (<font color='red'><b>She</b></font>)</div>She (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) made one more attempt to speak, but the sound was gone. Her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) image melted away. If it was
my mother, I had lost her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) again.
I felt like drowning myself. The only problem: I was immune to drowning.
Your father believes in you, she (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) had said.
She (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>)'d also called me brave ... unless she (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) was talking to the catfish.
I waded toward Riptide and grabbed it by the hilt. The Chimera might still be up there with its
snaky, fat mother, waiting to finish me off. At the very least, the mortal police would be arriving,
trying to figure out who had blown a hole in the Arch. If they found me, they'd have some questions.
I capped my sword, stuck the ballpoint pen in my pocket. <div class="bookquote">``Thank you, Father,''  (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div>I said again to the
dark water.
Then I kicked up through the muck and swam for the surface.
I came ashore next to a floating McDonald's.
A block away, every emergency vehicle in St. Louis was surrounding the Arch. Police helicopters
circled overhead. The crowd of onlookers reminded me of Times Square on New Year's Eve.
A little girl said, <div class="bookquote">``Mama! That boy walked out of the river.''
 (<font color='red'><b>A girl</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``That's nice, dear,''  (<font color='red'><b>mother</b></font>)</div>her (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) mother said, craning her (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) neck to watch the ambulances.
<div class="bookquote">``But he (<font color='blue'><b>Father</b></font>)'s dry!''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``That's nice, dear.''
 (<font color='red'><b>A news lady</b></font>)</div>A news lady was talking for the camera: <div class="bookquote">``Probably not a terrorist attack, we're told, but it's still
very early in the investigation. The damage, as you can see, is very serious. We're trying to get to
some of the survivors, to question them about eyewitness reports of someone falling from the Arch.''
 (<font color='red'><b>A news lady</b></font>)</div>Survivors. I felt a surge of relief. Maybe the park ranger and that family made it out safely. I
hoped Annabeth and Grover were okay.
I tried to push through the crowd to see what was going on inside the police line.
<div class="bookquote">``... an adolescent boy,''  (<font color='red'><b>another reporter</b></font>)</div>another reporter was saying. <div class="bookquote">``Channel Five has learned that surveillance
cameras show an adolescent boy going wild on the observation deck, somehow setting off this freak
explosion. Hard to believe, John, but that's what we're hearing. Again, no confirmed fatalities ...''

 (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div><p/>I backed away, trying to keep my head down. I had to go a long way around the police perimeter.
Uniformed officers and news reporters were everywhere.
I'd almost lost hope of ever finding Annabeth and Grover when a familiar voice bleated, <div class="bookquote">``Perrrcy!''
 (<font color='red'><b>Grover/Grover Underwood/GROVER</b></font>)</div>I turned and got tackled by Grover's bear hug-or goat hug. He (<font color='blue'><b>Grover</b></font>) said, <div class="bookquote">``We thought you'd gone to
Hades the hard way!''
 (<font color='red'><b>He</b></font>)</div>Annabeth stood behind him (<font color='blue'><b>Grover</b></font>), trying to look angry, but even she (<font color='blue'><b>I</b></font>) seemed relieved to see me. <div class="bookquote">``We
can't leave you alone for five minutes! What happened?''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``I sort of fell.''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``Percy! Six hundred and thirty feet?''
 (<font color='red'><b>a cop</b></font>)</div>Behind us, a cop shouted, <div class="bookquote">``Gangway!''  (<font color='red'><b>a cop</b></font>)</div>The crowd parted, and a couple of paramedics hustled out,
rolling a woman on a stretcher. I recognized her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) immediately as the mother of the little boy who'd
been on the observation deck. She (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) was saying, ``And then this huge dog, this huge fire-breathing
Chihuahua-``
<div class="bookquote">``Okay, ma’am,''  (<font color='red'><b>She</b></font>)</div>the paramedic said. <div class="bookquote">``Just calm down. Your family is fine. The medication is
starting to kick in.''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``I'm not crazy! This boy jumped out of the hole and the monster disappeared.''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>Then she (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) saw me.
<div class="bookquote">``There he (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>) is! That's the boy!''
 (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div>I turned quickly and pulled Annabeth and Grover after me. We disappeared into the crowd.
<div class="bookquote">``What's going on?''  (<font color='red'><b>Annabeth/ANNABETH</b></font>)</div>Annabeth demanded. <div class="bookquote">``Was she (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>) talking about the Chihuahua on the elevator?''
 (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div>I told them the whole story of the Chimera, Echidna, my high-dive act, and the underwater lady's
message.
<div class="bookquote">``Whoa,''  (<font color='red'><b>Grover/Grover Underwood/GROVER</b></font>)</div>said Grover. <div class="bookquote">``We've got to get you to Santa Monica! You can't ignore a summons from
your dad.''
 (<font color='red'><b>Annabeth/ANNABETH</b></font>)</div>Before Annabeth could respond, we passed another reporter doing a news break, and I almost
froze in my tracks when he (<font color='blue'><b>Grover</b></font>) said, <div class="bookquote">``Percy Jackson. That's right, Dan. Channel Twelve has learned that
the boy who may have caused this explosion fits the description of a young man wanted by authorities
for a serious New Jersey bus accident three days ago. And the boy is believed to be traveling west.
For our viewers at home, here is a photo of Percy Jackson.''
 (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>We ducked around the news van and slipped into an alley.
<div class="bookquote">``First things first,''  (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div>I told Grover. <div class="bookquote">``We've got to get out of town!''
 (<font color='red'><b>Amtrak</b></font>)</div>Somehow, we made it back to the Amtrak station without getting spotted. We got on board the
train just before it pulled out for Denver. The train trundled west as darkness fell, police lights still
pulsing against the St. Louis skyline behind us.

<p/>Percy Jackson 1 - The Lightning Thief
15 A GOD BUYS US
CHEESEBURGERS
The next afternoon, June 14, seven days before the solstice, our train rolled into Denver. We
hadn't eaten since the night before in the dining car, somewhere in Kansas. We hadn't taken a shower
since Half-Blood Hill, and I was sure that was obvious.
<div class="bookquote">``Let's try to contact Chiron,''  (<font color='red'><b>Annabeth/ANNABETH</b></font>)</div>Annabeth said. <div class="bookquote">``I want to tell him (<font color='blue'><b>Jackson</b></font>) about your talk with the river
spirit.''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``We can't use phones, right?''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``I'm not talking about phones.''
 (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div>We wandered through downtown for about half an hour, though I wasn't sure what Annabeth was
looking for. The air was dry and hot, which felt weird after the humidity of St. Louis. Everywhere we
turned, the Rocky Mountains seemed to be staring at me, like a tidal wave about to crash into the city.
Finally we found an empty do-it-yourself car wash. We veered toward the stall farthest from the
street, keeping our eyes open for patrol cars. We were three adolescents hanging out at a car wash
without a car; any cop worth his (<font color='blue'><b>cop</b></font>) doughnuts would figure we were up to no good.
<div class="bookquote">``What exactly are we doing?''  (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div>I asked, as Grover took out the spray gun.
<div class="bookquote">``It's seventy-five cents,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Grover</b></font>) grumbled. <div class="bookquote">``I've only got two quarters left. Annabeth?''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``Don't look at me,''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Rocky</b></font>) said. <div class="bookquote">``The dining car wiped me out.''
 (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div>I fished out my last bit of change and passed Grover a quarter, which left me two nickels and one
drachma from Medusa's place.
<div class="bookquote">``Excellent,''  (<font color='red'><b>Grover/Grover Underwood/GROVER</b></font>)</div>Grover said. <div class="bookquote">``We could do it with a spray bottle, of course, but the connection isn't
as good, and my arm gets tired of pumping.''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``What are you talking about?''
 (<font color='red'><b>He</b></font>)</div>He (<font color='blue'><b>Grover</b></font>) fed in the quarters and set the knob to FINE MIST. <div class="bookquote">``I-M'ing.''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``Instant messaging?''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``Iris-messaging,''  (<font color='red'><b>Annabeth/ANNABETH</b></font>)</div>Annabeth corrected. <div class="bookquote">``The rainbow goddess Iris carries messages for the gods.
If you know how to ask, and she (<font color='blue'><b>Iris</b></font>)'s not too busy, she (<font color='blue'><b>Iris</b></font>)'ll do the same for half-bloods.''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``You summon the goddess with a spray gun?''
 (<font color='red'><b>Grover/Grover Underwood/GROVER</b></font>)</div>Grover pointed the nozzle in the air and water hissed out in a thick white mist. <div class="bookquote">``Unless you know
an easier way to make a rainbow.''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>Sure enough, late afternoon light filtered through the vapor and broke into colors.
Annabeth held her (<font color='blue'><b>Rocky</b></font>) palm out to me. <div class="bookquote">``Drachma, please.''
 (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div>I handed it over.
She (<font color='blue'><b>Rocky</b></font>) raised the coin over her (<font color='blue'><b>Rocky</b></font>) head. <div class="bookquote">``O goddess, accept our offering.''
 (<font color='red'><b>She</b></font>)</div>She (<font color='blue'><b>Rocky</b></font>) threw the drachma into the rainbow. It disappeared in a golden shimmer.
<div class="bookquote">``Half-Blood Hill,''  (<font color='red'><b>Annabeth/ANNABETH</b></font>)</div>Annabeth requested.
For a moment, nothing happened.
Then I was looking through the mist at strawberry fields, and the Long Island Sound in the
distance. We seemed to be on the porch of the Big House. Standing with his (<font color='blue'><b>Long</b></font>) back to us at the railing
was a sandy-haired guy in shorts and an orange tank top. He (<font color='blue'><b>Long</b></font>) was holding a bronze sword and seemed

<p/>to be staring intently at something down in the meadow.
<div class="bookquote">``Luke!''  (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div>I called.
He (<font color='blue'><b>Long</b></font>) turned, eyes wide. I could swear he (<font color='blue'><b>Long</b></font>) was standing three feet in front of me through a screen of
mist, except I could only see the part of him (<font color='blue'><b>Long</b></font>) that appeared in the rainbow.
<div class="bookquote">``Percy!''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>His (<font color='blue'><b>Long</b></font>) scarred face broke into a grin. <div class="bookquote">``Is that Annabeth, too? Thank the gods! Are you guys
okay?''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``We're ... uh ... fine,''  (<font color='red'><b>Annabeth/ANNABETH</b></font>)</div>Annabeth stammered. She (<font color='blue'><b>Long</b></font>) was madly straightening her (<font color='blue'><b>Long</b></font>) dirty T-shirt, trying
to comb the loose hair out of her (<font color='blue'><b>Long</b></font>) face. ``We thought-Chiron-I mean-``
<div class="bookquote">``He (<font color='blue'><b>Percy</b></font>)'s down at the cabins.''  (<font color='red'><b>Luke</b></font>)</div>Luke's smile faded. <div class="bookquote">``We're having some issues with the campers.
Listen, is everything cool with you? Is Grover all right?''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``I'm right here,''  (<font color='red'><b>Grover/Grover Underwood/GROVER</b></font>)</div>Grover called. He (<font color='blue'><b>Grover</b></font>) held the nozzle out to one side and stepped into Luke's line of
vision. <div class="bookquote">``What kind of issues?''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>Just then a big Lincoln Continental pulled into the car wash with its stereo turned to maximum hiphop. As the car slid into the next stall, the bass from the subwoofers vibrated so much, it shook the
pavement.
<div class="bookquote">``Chiron had to-what's that noise?''  (<font color='red'><b>Luke</b></font>)</div>Luke yelled.
``I'll take care of it.''' Annabeth yelled back, looking very relieved to have an excuse to get out of
sight. ``Grover, come on!
<div class="bookquote">``What?''  (<font color='red'><b>Grover/Grover Underwood/GROVER</b></font>)</div>Grover said. ``But-``
<div class="bookquote">``Give Percy the nozzle and come on!''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Long</b></font>) ordered.
Grover muttered something about girls being harder to understand than the Oracle at Delphi, then
he (<font color='blue'><b>Grover</b></font>) handed me the spray gun and followed Annabeth.
I readjusted the hose so I could keep the rainbow going and still see Luke.
<div class="bookquote">``Chiron had to break up a fight,''  (<font color='red'><b>Luke</b></font>)</div>Luke shouted to me over the music. <div class="bookquote">``Things are pretty tense
here, Percy. Word leaked out about the Zeus-Poseidon standoff. We're still not sure how-probably
the same scumbag who summoned the hellhound. Now the campers are starting to take sides. It's
shaping up like the Trojan War all over again. Aphrodite, Ares, and Apollo are backing Poseidon,
more or less. Athena is backing Zeus.''
 (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div>I shuddered to think that Clarisse's cabin would ever be on my dad's side for anything. In the next
stall, I heard Annabeth and some guy arguing with each other, then the music's volume decreased
drastically.
<div class="bookquote">``So what's your status?''  (<font color='red'><b>Luke</b></font>)</div>Luke asked me. <div class="bookquote">``Chiron will be sorry he (<font color='blue'><b>Zeus</b></font>) missed you.''
 (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div>I told him (<font color='blue'><b>Luke</b></font>) pretty much everything, including my dreams. It felt so good to see him (<font color='blue'><b>Luke</b></font>), to feel like I
was back at camp even for a few minutes, that I didn't realize how long I had talked until the beeper
went off on the spray machine, and I realized I only had one more minute before the water shut off.
<div class="bookquote">``I wish I could be there,''  (<font color='red'><b>Luke</b></font>)</div>Luke told me. <div class="bookquote">``We can't help much from here, I'm afraid, but listen ...
it had to be Hades who took the master bolt. He (<font color='blue'><b>master</b></font>) was there at Olympus at the winter solstice. I was
chaperoning a field trip and we saw him (<font color='blue'><b>master</b></font>).''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``But Chiron said the gods can't take each other's magic items directly.''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``That's true,''  (<font color='red'><b>Luke</b></font>)</div>Luke said, looking troubled. <div class="bookquote">``Still ... Hades has the helm of darkness. How could
anybody else sneak into the throne room and steal the master bolt? You'd have to be invisible.''
 (<font color='red'><b>Luke</b></font>)</div>We were both silent, until Luke seemed to realize what he (<font color='blue'><b>Luke</b></font>)'d said.
<div class="bookquote">``Oh, hey,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Luke</b></font>) protested. <div class="bookquote">``I didn't mean Annabeth. She (<font color='blue'><b>it</b></font>) and I have known each other forever. She (<font color='blue'><b>it</b></font>)
would never ... I mean, she (<font color='blue'><b>it</b></font>)'s like a little sister to me.''
 (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div>I wondered if Annabeth would like that description. In the stall next to us, the music stopped

<p/>completely. A man screamed in terror, car doors slammed, and the Lincoln peeled out of the car
wash.
<div class="bookquote">``You'd better go see what that was,''  (<font color='red'><b>Luke</b></font>)</div>Luke said. <div class="bookquote">``Listen, are you wearing the flying shoes? I'll
feel better if I know they've done you some good.''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``Oh ... uh, yeah!''  (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div>I tried not to sound like a guilty liar. <div class="bookquote">``Yeah, they've come in handy.''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``Really?''  (<font color='red'><b>He</b></font>)</div>He (<font color='blue'><b>Luke</b></font>) grinned. <div class="bookquote">``They fit and everything?''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>The water shut off. The mist started to evaporate.
<div class="bookquote">``Well, take care of yourself out there in Denver,''  (<font color='red'><b>Luke</b></font>)</div>Luke called, his (<font color='blue'><b>Luke</b></font>) voice getting fainter. ``And tell
Grover it'll be better this time! Nobody will get turned into a pine tree if he (<font color='blue'><b>Grover</b></font>) just-``
But the mist was gone, and Luke's image faded to nothing. I was alone in a wet, empty car wash
stall.
Annabeth and Grover came around the corner, laughing, but stopped when they saw my face.
Annabeth's smile faded. <div class="bookquote">``What happened, Percy? What did Luke say?''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``Not much,''  (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div>I lied, my stomach feeling as empty as a Big Three cabin. <div class="bookquote">``Come on, let's find some
dinner.''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>A few minutes later, we were sitting at a booth in a gleaming chrome diner. All around us,
families were eating burgers and drinking malts and sodas.
Finally the waitress came over. She (<font color='blue'><b>waitress</b></font>) raised her (<font color='blue'><b>waitress</b></font>) eyebrow skeptically. <div class="bookquote">``Well?''
 (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div>I said, <div class="bookquote">``We, um, want to order dinner.''
 (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``You kids have money to pay for it?''
 (<font color='red'><b>Grover/Grover Underwood/GROVER</b></font>)</div>Grover's lower lip quivered. I was afraid he (<font color='blue'><b>lip</b></font>) would start bleating, or worse, start eating the
linoleum. Annabeth looked ready to pass out from hunger.
I was trying to think up a sob story for the waitress when a rumble shook the whole building; a
motorcycle the size of a baby elephant had pulled up to the curb.
All conversation in the diner stopped. The motorcycle's headlight glared red. Its gas tank had
flames painted on it, and a shotgun holster riveted to either side, complete with shotguns. The seat
was leather-but leather that looked like ... well, Caucasian human skin.
The guy on the bike would've made pro wrestlers run for Mama. He (<font color='blue'><b>guy</b></font>) was dressed in a red muscle
shirt and black jeans and a black leather duster, with a hunting knife strapped to his (<font color='blue'><b>guy</b></font>) thigh. He (<font color='blue'><b>guy</b></font>) wore
red wraparound shades, and he (<font color='blue'><b>guy</b></font>) had the cruelest, most brutal face I'd ever seen- handsome, I guess,
but wicked-with an oily black crew cut and cheeks that were scarred from many, many fights. The
weird thing was, I felt like I'd seen his (<font color='blue'><b>guy</b></font>) face somewhere before.
As he (<font color='blue'><b>guy</b></font>) walked into the diner, a hot, dry wind blew through the place. All the people rose, as if they
were hypnotized, but the biker waved his (<font color='blue'><b>biker</b></font>) hand dismissively and they all sat down again. Everybody
went back to their conversations. The waitress blinked, as if somebody had just pressed the rewind
button on her (<font color='blue'><b>waitress</b></font>) brain. She (<font color='blue'><b>waitress</b></font>) asked us again, <div class="bookquote">``You kids have money to pay for it?''
 (<font color='red'><b>She</b></font>)</div>The biker said, <div class="bookquote">``It's on me.''  (<font color='red'><b>The biker</b></font>)</div>He (<font color='blue'><b>biker</b></font>) slid into our booth, which was way too small for him (<font color='blue'><b>biker</b></font>), and
crowded Annabeth against the window.
He (<font color='blue'><b>biker</b></font>) looked up at the waitress, who was gaping at him (<font color='blue'><b>biker</b></font>), and said, <div class="bookquote">``Are you still here?''
 (<font color='red'><b>him</b></font>)</div>He (<font color='blue'><b>biker</b></font>) pointed at her (<font color='blue'><b>waitress</b></font>), and she (<font color='blue'><b>waitress</b></font>) stiffened. She (<font color='blue'><b>waitress</b></font>) turned as if she (<font color='blue'><b>waitress</b></font>)'d been spun around, then marched back
toward the kitchen.
The biker looked at me. I couldn't see his (<font color='blue'><b>biker</b></font>) eyes behind the red shades, but bad feelings started
boiling in my stomach. Anger, resentment, bitterness. I wanted to hit a wall. I wanted to pick a fight
with somebody. Who did this guy think he (<font color='blue'><b>guy</b></font>) was?
He (<font color='blue'><b>guy</b></font>) gave me a wicked grin. <div class="bookquote">``So you're old Seaweed's kid, huh?''

 (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div><p/>I should've been surprised, or scared, but instead I felt like I was looking at my stepdad, Gabe. I
wanted to rip this guy's head off. <div class="bookquote">``What's it to you?''
 (<font color='red'><b>Annabeth/ANNABETH</b></font>)</div>Annabeth's eyes flashed me a warning. ``Percy, this is-``
The biker raised his (<font color='blue'><b>biker</b></font>) hand.
<div class="bookquote">``S’okay,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>guy</b></font>) said. <div class="bookquote">``I don't mind a little attitude. Long as you remember who's the boss. You
know who I am, little cousin?''
 (<font color='red'><b>me</b></font>)</div>Then it struck me why this guy looked familiar. He (<font color='blue'><b>guy</b></font>) had the same vicious sneer as some of the kids
at Camp Half-Blood, the ones from cabin five.
<div class="bookquote">``You're Clarisse's dad,''  (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div>I said. <div class="bookquote">``Ares, god of war.''
 (<font color='red'><b>Ares</b></font>)</div>Ares grinned and took off his (<font color='blue'><b>guy</b></font>) shades. Where his (<font color='blue'><b>guy</b></font>) eyes should've been, there was only fire, empty
sockets glowing with miniature nuclear explosions. <div class="bookquote">``That's right, punk. I heard you broke Clarisse's
spear.''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``She (<font color='blue'><b>Clarisse</b></font>) was asking for it.''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``Probably. That's cool. I don't fight my kids' fights, you know? What I'm here for-I heard you
were in town. I got a little proposition for you.''
 (<font color='red'><b>The waitress</b></font>)</div>The waitress came back with heaping trays of food-cheeseburgers, fries, onion rings, and
chocolate shakes.
Ares handed her (<font color='blue'><b>waitress</b></font>) a few gold drachmas.
She (<font color='blue'><b>waitress</b></font>) looked nervously at the coins. <div class="bookquote">``But, these aren't...''
 (<font color='red'><b>Ares</b></font>)</div>Ares pulled out his (<font color='blue'><b>guy</b></font>) huge knife and started cleaning his (<font color='blue'><b>guy</b></font>) fingernails. <div class="bookquote">``Problem, sweetheart?''
 (<font color='red'><b>The waitress</b></font>)</div>The waitress swallowed, then left with the gold.
<div class="bookquote">``You can't do that,''  (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div>I told Ares. <div class="bookquote">``You can't just threaten people with a knife.''
 (<font color='red'><b>Ares</b></font>)</div>Ares laughed. <div class="bookquote">``Are you kidding? I love this country. Best place since Sparta. Don't you carry a
weapon, punk? You should. Dangerous world out there. Which brings me to my proposition. I need
you to do me a favor.''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``What favor could I do for a god?''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``Something a god doesn't have time to do himself. It's nothing much. I left my shield at an
abandoned water park here in town. I was going on a little ... date with my girlfriend. We were
interrupted. I left my shield behind. I want you to fetch it for me.''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``Why don't you go back and get it yourself?''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>The fire in his (<font color='blue'><b>guy</b></font>) eye sockets glowed a little hotter.
<div class="bookquote">``Why don't I turn you into a prairie dog and run you over with my Harley? Because I don't feel
like it. A god is giving you an opportunity to prove yourself, Percy Jackson. Will you prove yourself a
coward?''  (<font color='red'><b>He</b></font>)</div>He (<font color='blue'><b>guy</b></font>) leaned forward. <div class="bookquote">``Or maybe you only fight when there's a river to dive into, so your
daddy can protect you.''
 (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div>I wanted to punch this guy, but somehow, I knew he (<font color='blue'><b>guy</b></font>) was waiting for that. Ares's power was
causing my anger. He (<font color='blue'><b>guy</b></font>)'d love it if I attacked. I didn't want to give him (<font color='blue'><b>guy</b></font>) the satisfaction.
<div class="bookquote">``We're not interested,''  (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div>I said. <div class="bookquote">``We've already got a quest.''
 (<font color='red'><b>Ares</b></font>)</div>Ares's fiery eyes made me see things I didn't want to see-blood and smoke and corpses on the
battlefield. <div class="bookquote">``I know all about your quest, punk. When that item was first stolen, Zeus sent his (<font color='blue'><b>Zeus</b></font>) best out
looking for it: Apollo, Athena, Artemis, and me, naturally. If I couldn't sniff out a weapon that
powerful ...''  (<font color='red'><b>He</b></font>)</div>He (<font color='blue'><b>guy</b></font>) licked his (<font color='blue'><b>guy</b></font>) lips, as if the very thought of the master bolt made him (<font color='blue'><b>guy</b></font>) hungry. <div class="bookquote">``Well ...
if I couldn't find it, you got no hope. Nevertheless, I'm trying to give you the benefit of the doubt.
Your dad and I go way back. After all, I'm the one who told him (<font color='blue'><b>dad</b></font>) my suspicions about old Corpse
Breath.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``You told him (<font color='blue'><b>dad</b></font>) Hades stole the bolt?''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``Sure. Framing somebody to start a war. Oldest trick in the book. I recognized it immediately. In a
way, you got me to thank for your little quest.''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``Thanks,''  (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div>I grumbled.
<div class="bookquote">``Hey, I'm a generous guy. Just do my little job, and I'll help you on your way. I'll arrange a ride
west for you and your friends.''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``We're doing fine on our own.''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``Yeah, right. No money. No wheels. No clue what you're up against. Help me out, and maybe I'll
tell you something you need to know. Something about your mom.''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``My mom?''
 (<font color='red'><b>He</b></font>)</div>He (<font color='blue'><b>guy</b></font>) grinned. <div class="bookquote">``That got your attention. The water park is a mile west on Delancy. You can't miss it.
Look for the Tunnel of Love ride.''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``What interrupted your date?''  (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div>I asked. <div class="bookquote">``Something scare you off?''
 (<font color='red'><b>Ares</b></font>)</div>Ares bared his (<font color='blue'><b>guy</b></font>) teeth, but I'd seen his (<font color='blue'><b>guy</b></font>) threatening look before on Clarisse. There was something
false about it, almost like he (<font color='blue'><b>guy</b></font>) was nervous.
<div class="bookquote">``You're lucky you met me, punk, and not one of the other Olympians. They're not as forgiving of
rudeness as I am. I'll meet you back here when you're done. Don't disappoint me.''
 (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div>After that I must have fainted, or fallen into a trance, because when I opened my eyes again, Ares
was gone. I might've thought the conversation had been a dream, but Annabeth and Grover's
expressions told me otherwise.
<div class="bookquote">``Not good,''  (<font color='red'><b>Grover/Grover Underwood/GROVER</b></font>)</div>Grover said. <div class="bookquote">``Ares sought you out, Percy. This is not good.''
 (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div>I stared out the window. The motorcycle had disappeared.
Did Ares really know something about my mom, or was he (<font color='blue'><b>Grover</b></font>) just playing with me? Now that he (<font color='blue'><b>Grover</b></font>) was
gone, all the anger had drained out of me. I realized Ares must love to mess with people's emotions.
That was his (<font color='blue'><b>Grover</b></font>) power-cranking up the passions so badly, they clouded your ability to think.
<div class="bookquote">``It's probably some kind of trick,''  (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div>I said. <div class="bookquote">``Forget Ares. Let's just go.''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``We can't,''  (<font color='red'><b>Annabeth/ANNABETH</b></font>)</div>Annabeth said. <div class="bookquote">``Look, I hate Ares as much as anybody, but you don't ignore the gods
unless you want serious bad fortune. He (<font color='blue'><b>Percy</b></font>) wasn't kidding about turning you into a rodent.''
 (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div>I looked down at my cheeseburger, which suddenly didn't seem so appetizing. <div class="bookquote">``Why does he (<font color='blue'><b>Percy</b></font>) need
us?''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``Maybe it's a problem that requires brains,''  (<font color='red'><b>Annabeth/ANNABETH</b></font>)</div>Annabeth said. <div class="bookquote">``Ares has strength. That's all he (<font color='blue'><b>Percy</b></font>) has.
Even strength has to bow to wisdom sometimes.''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``But this water park ... he (<font color='blue'><b>Percy</b></font>) acted almost scared. What would make a war god run away like that?''
 (<font color='red'><b>Annabeth/ANNABETH</b></font>)</div>Annabeth and Grover glanced nervously at each other.
Annabeth said, <div class="bookquote">``I'm afraid we'll have to find out.''
 (<font color='red'><b>Annabeth/ANNABETH</b></font>)</div>The sun was sinking behind the mountains by the time we found the water park. Judging from the
sign, it once had been called WATERLAND, but now some of the letters were smashed out, so it read
WAT R A D.
The main gate was padlocked and topped with barbed wire. Inside, huge dry waterslides and
tubes and pipes curled everywhere, leading to empty pools. Old tickets and advertisements fluttered
around the asphalt. With night coming on, the place looked sad and creepy.
<div class="bookquote">``If Ares brings his (<font color='blue'><b>god</b></font>) girlfriend here for a date,''  (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div>I said, staring up at the barbed wire, <div class="bookquote">``I'd hate to
see what she (<font color='blue'><b>girlfriend</b></font>) looks like.''
 (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``Percy,''  (<font color='red'><b>Annabeth/ANNABETH</b></font>)</div>Annabeth warned. <div class="bookquote">``Be more respectful.''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``Why? I thought you hated Ares.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``He (<font color='blue'><b>Percy</b></font>)'s still a god. And his (<font color='blue'><b>Percy</b></font>) girlfriend is very temperamental.''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``You don't want to insult her (<font color='blue'><b>girlfriend</b></font>) looks,''  (<font color='red'><b>Grover/Grover Underwood/GROVER</b></font>)</div>Grover added.
<div class="bookquote">``Who is she (<font color='blue'><b>girlfriend</b></font>)? Echidna?''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``No, Aphrodite,''  (<font color='red'><b>Grover/Grover Underwood/GROVER</b></font>)</div>Grover said, a little dreamily. <div class="bookquote">``Goddess of love.''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``I thought she (<font color='blue'><b>girlfriend</b></font>) was married to somebody,''  (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div>I said. <div class="bookquote">``Hephaestus.''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``What's your point?''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Grover</b></font>) asked.
<div class="bookquote">``Oh.''  (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div>I suddenly felt the need to change the subject. <div class="bookquote">``So how do we get in?''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``Maia!''  (<font color='red'><b>Grover/Grover Underwood/GROVER</b></font>)</div>Grover's shoes sprouted wings.
He (<font color='blue'><b>Grover</b></font>) flew over the fence, did an unintended somersault in midair, then stumbled to a landing on the
opposite side. He (<font color='blue'><b>Grover</b></font>) dusted off his (<font color='blue'><b>Grover</b></font>) jeans, as if he (<font color='blue'><b>Grover</b></font>)'d planned the whole thing. <div class="bookquote">``You guys coming?''
 (<font color='red'><b>Annabeth/ANNABETH</b></font>)</div>Annabeth and I had to climb the old-fashioned way, holding down the barbed wire for each other
as we crawled over the top.
The shadows grew long as we walked through the park, checking out the attractions. There was
Ankle Biter Island, Head Over Wedgie, and Dude, Where's My Swimsuit?
No monsters came to get us. Nothing made the slightest noise.
We found a souvenir shop that had been left open. Merchandise still lined the shelves: snow
globes, pencils, postcards, and racks of<div class="bookquote">``Clothes,''  (<font color='red'><b>Annabeth/ANNABETH</b></font>)</div>Annabeth said. <div class="bookquote">``Fresh clothes.''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``Yeah,''  (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div>I said. ``But you can't just-``
<div class="bookquote">``Watch me.''
 (<font color='red'><b>She</b></font>)</div>She (<font color='blue'><b>Annabeth</b></font>) snatched an entire row of stuff of the racks and disappeared into the changing room. A few
minutes later she (<font color='blue'><b>Annabeth</b></font>) came out in Waterland flower-print shorts, a big red Waterland T-shirt, and
commemorative Waterland surf shoes. A Waterland backpack was slung over her (<font color='blue'><b>Annabeth</b></font>) shoulder, obviously
stuffed with more goodies.
<div class="bookquote">``What the heck.''  (<font color='red'><b>Grover/Grover Underwood/GROVER</b></font>)</div>Grover shrugged. Soon, all three of us were decked out like walking
advertisements for the defunct theme park.
We continued searching for the Tunnel of Love. I got the feeling that the whole park was holding
its breath. <div class="bookquote">``So Ares and Aphrodite,''  (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div>I said, to keep my mind off the growing dark, <div class="bookquote">``they have a thing
going?''
 (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``That's old gossip, Percy,''  (<font color='red'><b>Annabeth/ANNABETH</b></font>)</div>Annabeth told me. <div class="bookquote">``Three-thousand-year-old gossip.''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``What about Aphrodite's husband?''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``Well, you know,''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Annabeth</b></font>) said. <div class="bookquote">``Hephaestus. The blacksmith. He (<font color='blue'><b>blacksmith</b></font>) was crippled when he (<font color='blue'><b>blacksmith</b></font>) was a baby,
thrown off Mount Olympus by Zeus. So he (<font color='blue'><b>Zeus</b></font>) isn't exactly handsome. Clever with his (<font color='blue'><b>Zeus</b></font>) hands, and all, but
Aphrodite isn't into brains and talent, you know?''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``She (<font color='blue'><b>Hephaestus</b></font>) likes bikers.''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``Whatever.''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``Hephaestus knows?''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``Oh sure,''  (<font color='red'><b>Annabeth/ANNABETH</b></font>)</div>Annabeth said. <div class="bookquote">``He (<font color='blue'><b>Zeus</b></font>) caught them together once. I mean, literally caught them, in a
golden net, and invited all the gods to come and laugh at them. Hephaestus is always trying to
embarrass them. That's why they meet in out-of-the-way places, like ...''
 (<font color='red'><b>She</b></font>)</div>She (<font color='blue'><b>Annabeth</b></font>) stopped, looking straight ahead. <div class="bookquote">``Like that.''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>In front of us was an empty pool that would've been awesome for skateboarding. It was at least
fifty yards across and shaped like a bowl.
Around the rim, a dozen bronze statues of Cupid stood guard with wings spread and bows ready
to fire. On the opposite side from us, a tunnel opened up, probably where the water flowed into when

<p/>the pool was full. The sign above it read, THRILL RIDE O' LOVE: THIS IS NOT YOUR
PARENTS' TUNNEL OF LOVE!
Grover crept toward the edge. <div class="bookquote">``Guys, look.''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>Marooned at the bottom of the pool was a pink-and-white two-seater boat with a canopy over the
top and little hearts painted all over it. In the left seat, glinting in the fading light, was Ares's shield, a
polished circle of bronze.
<div class="bookquote">``This is too easy,''  (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div>I said. <div class="bookquote">``So we just walk down there and get it?''
 (<font color='red'><b>Annabeth/ANNABETH</b></font>)</div>Annabeth ran her (<font color='blue'><b>it</b></font>) fingers along the base of the nearest Cupid statue.
<div class="bookquote">``There's a Greek letter carved here,''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>it</b></font>) said. <div class="bookquote">``Eta. I wonder ...''
 (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``Grover,''  (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div>I said, <div class="bookquote">``you smell any monsters?''
 (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div>He (<font color='blue'><b>Grover</b></font>) sniffed the wind. <div class="bookquote">``Nothing.''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``Nothing-like, in-the-Arch-and-you-didn't-smell-Echidna nothing, or really nothing?''
 (<font color='red'><b>Grover/Grover Underwood/GROVER</b></font>)</div>Grover looked hurt. <div class="bookquote">``I told you, that was underground.''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``Okay, I'm sorry.''  (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div>I took a deep breath. <div class="bookquote">``I'm going down there.''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``I'll go with you.''  (<font color='red'><b>Grover/Grover Underwood/GROVER</b></font>)</div>Grover didn't sound too enthusiastic, but I got the feeling he (<font color='blue'><b>Grover</b></font>) was trying to
make up for what had happened in St. Louis.
<div class="bookquote">``No,''  (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div>I told him (<font color='blue'><b>Louis</b></font>). <div class="bookquote">``I want you to stay up top with the flying shoes. You're the Red Baron, a flying
ace, remember? I'll be counting on you for backup, in case something goes wrong.''
 (<font color='red'><b>Grover/Grover Underwood/GROVER</b></font>)</div>Grover puffed up his (<font color='blue'><b>Grover</b></font>) chest a little. <div class="bookquote">``Sure. But what could go wrong?''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>``I don't know. Just a feeling. Annabeth, come with me-``
<div class="bookquote">``Are you kidding?''  (<font color='red'><b>She</b></font>)</div>She (<font color='blue'><b>it</b></font>) looked at me as if I'd just dropped from the moon. Her (<font color='blue'><b>it</b></font>) cheeks were
bright red.
<div class="bookquote">``What's the problem now?''  (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div>I demanded.
<div class="bookquote">``Me, go with you to the ... the `Thrill Ride of Love'? How embarrassing is that? What if
somebody saw me?''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``Who's going to see you?''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>But my face was burning now, too. Leave it to a girl to make
everything complicated. <div class="bookquote">``Fine,''  (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div>I told her (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>). <div class="bookquote">``I'll do it myself.''  (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div>But when I started down the side of the
pool, she (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) followed me, muttering about how boys always messed things up.
We reached the boat. The shield was propped on one seat, and next to it was a lady's silk scarf. I
tried to imagine Ares and Aphrodite here, a couple of gods meeting in a junked-out amusement-park
ride. Why? Then I noticed something I hadn't seen from up top: mirrors all the way around the rim of
the pool, facing this spot. We could see ourselves no matter which direction we looked. That must be
it. While Ares and Aphrodite were smooching with each other they could look at their favorite
people: themselves.
I picked up the scarf. It shimmered pink, and the perfume was indescribable-rose, or mountain
laurel. Something good. I smiled, a little dreamy, and was about to rub the scarf against my cheek
when Annabeth ripped it out of my hand and stuffed it in her (<font color='blue'><b>I</b></font>) pocket. <div class="bookquote">``Oh, no you don't. Stay away
from that love magic.''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``What?''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``Just get the shield, Seaweed Brain, and let's get out of here.''
 (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div>The moment I touched the shield, I knew we were in trouble. My hand broke through something
that had been connecting it to the dashboard. A cobweb, I thought, but then I looked at a strand of it on
my palm and saw it was some kind of metal filament, so fine it was almost invisible. A trip wire.
<div class="bookquote">``Wait,''  (<font color='red'><b>Annabeth/ANNABETH</b></font>)</div>Annabeth said.
<div class="bookquote">``Too late.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``There's another Greek letter on the side of the boat, another Eta. This is a trap.''
 (<font color='red'><b>giant</b></font>)</div>Noise erupted all around us, of a million gears grinding, as if the whole pool were turning into
one giant machine.
Grover yelled, <div class="bookquote">``Guys!''
 (<font color='red'><b>Grover/Grover Underwood/GROVER</b></font>)</div>Up on the rim, the Cupid statues were drawing their bows into firing position. Before I could
suggest taking cover, they shot, but not at us. They fired at each other, across the rim of the pool. Silky
cables trailed from the arrows, arcing over the pool and anchoring where they landed to form a huge
golden asterisk. Then smaller metallic threads started weaving together magically between the main
strands, making a net.
<div class="bookquote">``We have to get out,''  (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div>I said.
<div class="bookquote">``Duh!''  (<font color='red'><b>Annabeth/ANNABETH</b></font>)</div>Annabeth said.
I grabbed the shield and we ran, but going up the slope of the pool was not as easy as going down.
<div class="bookquote">``Come on!''  (<font color='red'><b>Grover/Grover Underwood/GROVER</b></font>)</div>Grover shouted.
He (<font color='blue'><b>Grover</b></font>) was trying to hold open a section of the net for us, but wherever he (<font color='blue'><b>Grover</b></font>) touched it, the golden
threads started to wrap around his (<font color='blue'><b>Grover</b></font>) hands.
The Cupids' heads popped open. Out came video cameras. Spotlights rose up all around the pool,
blinding us with illumination, and a loudspeaker voice boomed: <div class="bookquote">``Live to Olympus in one minute ...
Fifty-nine seconds, fifty-eight ...''
 (<font color='red'><b>Annabeth/ANNABETH</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``Hephaestus!''  (<font color='red'><b>Annabeth/ANNABETH</b></font>)</div>Annabeth screamed. <div class="bookquote">``I'm so stupid.' Eta is H.' He (<font color='blue'><b>H.</b></font>) made this trap to catch his (<font color='blue'><b>H.</b></font>) wife
with Ares. Now we're going to be broadcast live to Olympus and look like absolute fools!''
 (<font color='red'><b>thousands</b></font>)</div>We'd almost made it to the rim when the row of mirrors opened like hatches and thousands of tiny
metallic ... things poured out.
Annabeth screamed.
It was an army of wind-up creepy-crawlies: bronze-gear bodies, spindly legs, little pincer
mouths, all scuttling toward us in a wave of clacking, whirring metal.
<div class="bookquote">``Spiders!''  (<font color='red'><b>Annabeth/ANNABETH</b></font>)</div>Annabeth said. <div class="bookquote">``Sp-sp-aaaah!''
 (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div>I'd never seen her (<font color='blue'><b>Annabeth</b></font>) like this before. She (<font color='blue'><b>Annabeth</b></font>) fell backward in terror and almost got overwhelmed by
the spider robots before I pulled her (<font color='blue'><b>Annabeth</b></font>) up and dragged her (<font color='blue'><b>Annabeth</b></font>) back toward the boat.
The things were coming out from all around the rim now, millions of them, flooding toward the
center of the pool, completely surrounding us. I told myself they probably weren't programmed to
kill, just corral us and bite us and make us look stupid. Then again, this was a trap meant for gods.
And we weren't gods.
Annabeth and I climbed into the boat. I started kicking away the spiders as they swarmed aboard.
I yelled at Annabeth to help me, but she (<font color='blue'><b>Annabeth</b></font>) was too paralyzed to do much more than scream.
<div class="bookquote">``Thirty, twenty-nine,''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>called the loudspeaker.
The spiders started spitting out strands of metal thread, trying to tie us down. The strands were
easy enough to break at first, but there were so many of them, and the spiders just kept coming. I
kicked one away from Annabeth's leg and its pincers took a chunk out of my new surf shoe.
Grover hovered above the pool in his (<font color='blue'><b>Grover</b></font>) flying sneakers, trying to pull the net loose, but it wouldn't
budge.
Think, I told myself. Think.
The Tunnel of Love entrance was under the net. We could use it as an exit, except that it was
blocked by a million robot spiders.
<div class="bookquote">``Fifteen, fourteen,''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>the loudspeaker called.
Water, I thought. Where does the ride's water come from?

<p/>Then I saw them: huge water pipes behind the mirrors, where the spiders had come from. And up
above the net, next to one of the Cupids, a glass-windowed booth that must be the controller's station.
<div class="bookquote">``Grover!''  (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div>I yelled. <div class="bookquote">``Get into that booth! Find the `on' switch!''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>``But-``
<div class="bookquote">``Do it!''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>It was a crazy hope, but it was our only chance. The spiders were all over the prow of
the boat now. Annabeth was screaming her (<font color='blue'><b>I</b></font>) head off. I had to get us out of there.
Grover was in the controller's booth now, slamming away at the buttons.
``Five, four-``
Grover looked up at me hopelessly, raising his (<font color='blue'><b>Grover</b></font>) hands. He (<font color='blue'><b>Grover</b></font>) was letting me know that he (<font color='blue'><b>Grover</b></font>)'d pushed
every button, but still nothing was happening.
I closed my eyes and thought about waves, rushing water, the Mississippi River. I felt a familiar
tug in my gut. I tried to imagine that I was dragging the ocean all the way to Denver.
<div class="bookquote">``Two, one, zero!''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>Water exploded out of the pipes. It roared into the pool, sweeping away the spiders. I pulled
Annabeth into the seat next to me and fastened her (<font color='blue'><b>I</b></font>) seat belt just as the tidal wave slammed into our
boat, over the top, whisking the spiders away and dousing us completely, but not capsizing us. The
boat turned, lifted in the flood, and spun in circles around the whirlpool.
The water was full of short-circuiting spiders, some of them smashing against the pool's concrete
wall with such force they burst.
Spotlights glared down at us. The Cupid-cams were rolling, live to Olympus.
But I could only concentrate on controlling the boat. I willed it to ride the current, to keep away
from the wall. Maybe it was my imagination, but the boat seemed to respond. At least, it didn't break
into a million pieces. We spun around one last time, the water level now almost high enough to shred
us against the metal net. Then the boat's nose turned toward the tunnel and we rocketed through into
the darkness.
Annabeth and I held tight, both of us screaming as the boat shot curls and hugged corners and took
forty-five-degree plunges past pictures of Romeo and Juliet and a bunch of other Valentine's Day
stuff.
Then we were out of the tunnel, the night air whistling through our hair as the boat barreled
straight toward the exit.
If the ride had been in working order, we would've sailed off a ramp between the golden Gates of
Love and splashed down safely in the exit pool. But there was a problem. The Gates of Love were
chained. Two boats that had been washed out of the tunnel before us were now piled against the
barricade-one submerged, the other cracked in half.
<div class="bookquote">``Unfasten your seat belt,''  (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div>I yelled to Annabeth.
<div class="bookquote">``Are you crazy?''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``Unless you want to get smashed to death.''  (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div>I strapped Ares's shield to my arm. <div class="bookquote">``We're going to
have to jump for it.''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>My idea was simple and insane. As the boat struck, we would use its force like a
springboard to jump the gate. I'd heard of people surviving car crashes that way, getting thrown thirty
or forty feet away from an accident. With luck, we would land in the pool.
Annabeth seemed to understand. She (<font color='blue'><b>Annabeth</b></font>) gripped my hand as the gates got closer.
<div class="bookquote">``On my mark,''  (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div>I said.
<div class="bookquote">``No! On my mark!''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``What?''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``Simple physics!''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Annabeth</b></font>) yelled. ``Force times the trajectory angle-``

<p/>``Fine.''' I shouted. ``On your mark!''
She (<font color='blue'><b>Annabeth</b></font>) hesitated ... hesitated ... then yelled, ``Now!''
Crack!
Annabeth was right. If we'd jumped when I thought we should've, we would've crashed into the
gates. She (<font color='blue'><b>Annabeth</b></font>) got us maximum lift.
Unfortunately, that was a little more than we needed. Our boat smashed into the pileup and we
were thrown into the air, straight over the gates, over the pool, and down toward solid asphalt.
Something grabbed me from behind.
Annabeth yelled, ``Ouch!''
Grover!
In midair, he (<font color='blue'><b>Grover</b></font>) had grabbed me by the shirt, and Annabeth by the arm, and was trying to pull us out
of a crash landing, but Annabeth and I had all the momentum.
``You're too heavy!'' Grover said. ``We're going down!''
We spiraled toward the ground, Grover doing his (<font color='blue'><b>Grover</b></font>) best to slow the fall.
We smashed into a photo-board, Grover's head going straight into the hole where tourists would
put their faces, pretending to be Noo-Noo the Friendly Whale. Annabeth and I tumbled to the ground,
banged up but alive. Ares's shield was still on my arm.
Once we caught our breath, Annabeth and I got Grover out of the photo-board and thanked him (<font color='blue'><b>Grover</b></font>) for
saving our lives. I looked back at the Thrill Ride of Love. The water was subsiding. Our boat had
been smashed to pieces against the gates.
A hundred yards away, at the entrance pool, the Cupids were still filming. The statues had
swiveled so that their cameras were trained straight on us, the spotlights in our faces.
``Show's over!'' I yelled. ``Thank you! Good night!''
The Cupids turned back to their original positions. The lights shut off. The park went quiet and
dark again, except for the gentle trickle of water into the Thrill Ride of Love's exit pool. I wondered
if Olympus had gone to a commercial break, or if our ratings had been any good.
I hated being teased. I hated being tricked. And I had plenty of experience handling bullies who
liked to do that stuff to me. I hefted the shield on my arm and turned to my friends. <div class="bookquote">``We need to have a
little talk with Ares.''

The war god was waiting for us in the diner parking lot.
<div class="bookquote">``Well, well,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>god</b></font>) said. <div class="bookquote">``You didn't get yourself killed.''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``You knew it was a trap,''  (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div>I said.
Ares gave me a wicked grin. <div class="bookquote">``Bet that crippled blacksmith was surprised when he (<font color='blue'><b>blacksmith</b></font>) netted a couple
of stupid kids. You looked good on TV.''
 (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div>I shoved his (<font color='blue'><b>god</b></font>) shield at him (<font color='blue'><b>god</b></font>). <div class="bookquote">``You're a jerk.''
 (<font color='red'><b>Annabeth/ANNABETH</b></font>)</div>Annabeth and Grover caught their breath.
Ares grabbed the shield and spun it in the air like pizza dough. It changed form, melting into a
bulletproof vest. He (<font color='blue'><b>Grover</b></font>) slung it across his (<font color='blue'><b>Grover</b></font>) back.
<div class="bookquote">``See that truck over there?''  (<font color='red'><b>He</b></font>)</div>He (<font color='blue'><b>Grover</b></font>) pointed to an eighteen-wheeler parked across the street from the
diner. <div class="bookquote">``That's your ride. Take you straight to L.A., with one stop in Vegas.''
 (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div>The eighteen-wheeler had a sign on the back, which I could read only because it was reverseprinted white on black, a good combination for dyslexia: KINDNESS INTERNATIONAL:
HUMANE ZOO TRANSPORT. WARNING: LIVE WILD ANIMALS.
I said, <div class="bookquote">``You're kidding.''
 (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div>Ares snapped his (<font color='blue'><b>Grover</b></font>) fingers. The back door of the truck unlatched. <div class="bookquote">``Free ride west, punk. Stop
complaining. And here's a little something for doing the job.''
 (<font color='red'><b>He</b></font>)</div>He (<font color='blue'><b>Grover</b></font>) slung a blue nylon backpack off his (<font color='blue'><b>Grover</b></font>) handlebars and tossed it to me.
Inside were fresh clothes for all of us, twenty bucks in cash, a pouch full of golden drachmas, and
a bag of Double Stuf Oreos.
I said, ``I don't want your lousy-``
<div class="bookquote">``Thank you, Lord Ares,''  (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div>Grover interrupted, giving me his (<font color='blue'><b>Grover</b></font>) best red-alert warning look. <div class="bookquote">``Thanks a
lot.''
 (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div>I gritted my teeth. It was probably a deadly insult to refuse something from a god, but I didn't want
anything that Ares had touched. Reluctantly, I slung the backpack over my shoulder. I knew my anger
was being caused by the war god's presence, but I was still itching to punch him (<font color='blue'><b>god</b></font>) in the nose. He (<font color='blue'><b>god</b></font>)
reminded me of every bully I'd ever faced: Nancy Bobofit, Clarisse, Smelly Gabe, sarcastic
teachers-every jerk who'd called me stupid in school or laughed at me when I'd gotten expelled.
I looked back at the diner, which had only a couple of customers now. The waitress who'd served
us dinner was watching nervously out the window, like she (<font color='blue'><b>waitress</b></font>) was afraid Ares might hurt us. She (<font color='blue'><b>waitress</b></font>)
dragged the fry cook out from the kitchen to see. She (<font color='blue'><b>waitress</b></font>) said something to him (<font color='blue'><b>cook</b></font>). He (<font color='blue'><b>cook</b></font>) nodded, held up a
little disposable camera and snapped a picture of us.
Great, I thought. We'll make the papers again tomorrow.
I imagined the headline: TWELVE-YEAR-OLD OUTLAW BEATS UP DEFENSELESS BIKER.
<div class="bookquote">``You owe me one more thing,''  (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div>I told Ares, trying to keep my voice level. <div class="bookquote">``You promised me
information about my mother.''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``You sure you can handle the news?''  (<font color='red'><b>He</b></font>)</div>He (<font color='blue'><b>Great</b></font>) kick-started his (<font color='blue'><b>Great</b></font>) motorcycle. <div class="bookquote">``She (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>)'s not dead.''
 (<font color='red'><b>me</b></font>)</div>The ground seemed to spin beneath me. <div class="bookquote">``What do you mean?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I mean she (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) was taken away from the Minotaur before she (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) could die. She (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) was turned into a

 (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div>I balled up my fists. <div class="bookquote">``You're pretty smug, Lord Ares, for a guy who runs from Cupid statues.''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>Behind his (<font color='blue'><b>Great</b></font>) sunglasses, fire glowed. I felt a hot wind in my hair. <div class="bookquote">``We'll meet again, Percy
Jackson. Next time you're in a fight, watch your back.''
 (<font color='red'><b>He</b></font>)</div>He (<font color='blue'><b>Great</b></font>) revved his (<font color='blue'><b>Great</b></font>) Harley, then roared off down Delancy Street.
Annabeth said, <div class="bookquote">``That was not smart, Percy.''
 (<font color='red'><b>Annabeth/ANNABETH</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``I don't care.''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``You don't want a god as your enemy. Especially not that god.''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``Hey, guys,''  (<font color='red'><b>Grover/Grover Underwood/GROVER</b></font>)</div>Grover said. <div class="bookquote">``I hate to interrupt, but ...''
 (<font color='red'><b>He</b></font>)</div>He (<font color='blue'><b>Grover</b></font>) pointed toward the diner. At the register, the last two customers were paying their check, two
men in identical black coveralls, with a white logo on their backs that matched the one on the
KINDNESS INTERNATIONAL truck.
<div class="bookquote">``If we're taking the zoo express,''  (<font color='red'><b>Grover/Grover Underwood/GROVER</b></font>)</div>Grover said, <div class="bookquote">``we need to hurry.''
 (<font color='red'><b>Grover/Grover Underwood/GROVER</b></font>)</div>I didn't like it, but we had no better option. Besides, I'd seen enough of Denver.
We ran across the street and climbed in the back of the big rig, closing the doors behind us.
The first thing that hit me was the smell. It was like the world's biggest pan of kitty litter.
The trailer was dark inside until I uncapped Anaklusmos. The blade cast a faint bronze light over
a very sad scene. Sitting in a row of filthy metal cages were three of the most pathetic zoo animals I'd
ever beheld: a zebra, a male albino lion, and some weird antelope thing I didn't know the name for.
Someone had thrown the lion a sack of turnips, which he (<font color='blue'><b>albino</b></font>) obviously didn't want to eat. The zebra
and the antelope had each gotten a Styrofoam tray of hamburger meat. The zebra's mane was matted
with chewing gum, like somebody had been spitting on it in their spare time. The antelope had a
stupid silver birthday balloon tied to one of his (<font color='blue'><b>albino</b></font>) horns that read OVER THE HILL!
Apparently, nobody had wanted to get close enough to the lion to mess with him (<font color='blue'><b>albino</b></font>), but the poor
thing was pacing around on soiled blankets, in a space way too small for him (<font color='blue'><b>albino</b></font>), panting from the stuffy
heat of the trailer. He (<font color='blue'><b>albino</b></font>) had flies buzzing around his (<font color='blue'><b>albino</b></font>) pink eyes and his (<font color='blue'><b>albino</b></font>) ribs showed through his (<font color='blue'><b>albino</b></font>) white
fur.
<div class="bookquote">``This is kindness?''  (<font color='red'><b>Grover/Grover Underwood/GROVER</b></font>)</div>Grover yelled. <div class="bookquote">``Humane zoo transport?''
 (<font color='red'><b>He</b></font>)</div>He (<font color='blue'><b>Grover</b></font>) probably would've gone right back outside to beat up the truckers with his (<font color='blue'><b>Grover</b></font>) reed pipes, and I
would've helped him (<font color='blue'><b>Grover</b></font>), but just then the trucks engine roared to life, the trailer started shaking, and we
were forced to sit down or fall down.
We huddled in the corner on some mildewed feed sacks, trying to ignore the smell and the heat
and the flies. Grover talked to the animals in a series of goat bleats, but they just stared at him (<font color='blue'><b>Grover</b></font>) sadly.
Annabeth was in favor of breaking the cages and freeing them on the spot, but I pointed out it
wouldn't do much good until the truck stopped moving. Besides, I had a feeling we might look a lot
better to the lion than those turnips.
I found a water jug and refilled their bowls, then used Anaklusmos to drag the mismatched food
out of their cages. I gave the meat to the lion and the turnips to the zebra and the antelope.
Grover calmed the antelope down, while Annabeth used her (<font color='blue'><b>Annabeth</b></font>) knife to cut the balloon off his (<font color='blue'><b>Grover</b></font>) horn.
She (<font color='blue'><b>Annabeth</b></font>) wanted to cut the gum out of the zebra's mane, too, but we decided that would be too risky with

<p/>the truck bumping around. We told Grover to promise the animals we'd help them more in the
morning, then we settled in for night.
Grover curled up on a turnip sack; Annabeth opened our bag of Double Stuf Oreos and nibbled on
one halfheartedly; I tried to cheer myself up by concentrating on the fact that we were halfway to Los
Angeles. Halfway to our destination. It was only June fourteenth. The solstice wasn't until the twentyfirst. We could make it in plenty of time.
On the other hand, I had no idea what to expect next. The gods kept toying with me. At least
Hephaestus had the decency to be honest about it-he'd put up cameras and advertised me as
entertainment. But even when the cameras weren't rolling, I had a feeling my quest was being
watched. I was a source of amusement for the gods.
<div class="bookquote">``Hey,''  (<font color='red'><b>Annabeth/ANNABETH</b></font>)</div>Annabeth said, <div class="bookquote">``I'm sorry for freaking out back at the water park, Percy.''
 (<font color='red'><b>Annabeth/ANNABETH</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``That's okay.''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``It's just...''  (<font color='red'><b>She</b></font>)</div>She (<font color='blue'><b>Annabeth</b></font>) shuddered. <div class="bookquote">``Spiders.''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``Because of the Arachne story,''  (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div>I guessed. <div class="bookquote">``She (<font color='blue'><b>your</b></font>) got turned into a spider for challenging your mom
to a weaving contest, right?''
 (<font color='red'><b>Annabeth/ANNABETH</b></font>)</div>Annabeth nodded. <div class="bookquote">``Arachne's children have been taking revenge on the children of Athena ever
since. If there's a spider within a mile of me, it'll find me. I hate the creepy little things. Anyway, I
owe you.''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``We're a team, remember?''  (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div>I said. <div class="bookquote">``Besides, Grover did the fancy flying.''
 (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div>I thought he (<font color='blue'><b>Annabeth</b></font>) was asleep, but he (<font color='blue'><b>Annabeth</b></font>) mumbled from the corner, <div class="bookquote">``I was pretty amazing, wasn't I?''
 (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>Annabeth and I laughed.
She (<font color='blue'><b>Annabeth</b></font>) pulled apart an Oreo, handed me half. <div class="bookquote">``In the Iris message ... did Luke really say nothing?''
 (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div>I munched my cookie and thought about how to answer. The conversation via rainbow had
bothered me all evening. <div class="bookquote">``Luke said you and he (<font color='blue'><b>Luke</b></font>) go way back. He (<font color='blue'><b>Luke</b></font>) also said Grover wouldn't fail this
time. Nobody would turn into a pine tree.''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>In the dim bronze light of the sword blade, it was hard to read their expressions.
Grover let out a mournful bray.
<div class="bookquote">``I should've told you the truth from the beginning.''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>His (<font color='blue'><b>Grover</b></font>) voice trembled. <div class="bookquote">``I thought if you knew
what a failure I was, you wouldn't want me along.''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``You were the satyr who tried to rescue Thalia, the daughter of Zeus.''
 (<font color='red'><b>He</b></font>)</div>He (<font color='blue'><b>Grover</b></font>) nodded glumly.
<div class="bookquote">``And the other two half-bloods Thalia befriended, the ones who got safely to camp ...''  (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div>I looked
at Annabeth. <div class="bookquote">``That was you and Luke, wasn't it?''
 (<font color='red'><b>She</b></font>)</div>She (<font color='blue'><b>Annabeth</b></font>) put down her (<font color='blue'><b>Annabeth</b></font>) Oreo, uneaten. <div class="bookquote">``Like you said, Percy, a seven-year-old half-blood wouldn't

amazing monster-fighters, even without training. We traveled north from Virginia without any real
plans, fending off monsters for about two weeks before Grover found us.''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``I was supposed to escort Thalia to camp,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Grover</b></font>) said, sniffling. <div class="bookquote">``Only Thalia. I had strict orders

but I couldn't just leave Luke and Annabeth by themselves. I thought ... I thought I could lead all three
of them to safety. It was my fault the Kindly Ones caught up with us. I froze. I got scared on the way
back to camp and took some wrong turns. If I'd just been a little quicker ...''
 (<font color='red'><b>Annabeth/ANNABETH</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``Stop it,''  (<font color='red'><b>Annabeth/ANNABETH</b></font>)</div>Annabeth said. <div class="bookquote">``No one blames you. Thalia didn't blame you either.''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``She (<font color='blue'><b>Thalia</b></font>) sacrificed herself to save us,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Grover</b></font>) said miserably, ``Her (<font color='blue'><b>Thalia</b></font>) death was my fault. The Council of

<p/>Cloven Elders said so.''
``Because you wouldn't leave two other half-bloods behind?'' I said. ``That's not fair.''
``Percy's right,'' Annabeth said. ``I wouldn't be here today if it weren't for you, Grover. Neither
would Luke. We don't care what the council says.''
Grover kept sniffling in the dark. ``It's just my luck. I'm the lamest satyr ever, and I find the two
most powerful half-bloods of the century, Thalia and Percy.''
``You're not lame,'' Annabeth insisted. ``You've got more courage than any satyr I've ever met.
Name one other who would dare go to the Underworld. I bet Percy is really glad you're here right
now.''
She (<font color='blue'><b>Annabeth</b></font>) kicked me in the shin.
``Yeah,'' I said, which I would've done even without the kick. ``It's not luck that you found Thalia
and me, Grover. You've got the biggest heart of any satyr ever. You're a natural searcher. That's why
you'll be the one who finds Pan.''
I heard a deep, satisfied sigh. I waited for Grover to say something, but his (<font color='blue'><b>Grover</b></font>) breathing only got
heavier. When the sound turned to snoring, I realized he (<font color='blue'><b>Grover</b></font>)'d fallen sleep.
``How does he (<font color='blue'><b>Grover</b></font>) do that?'' I marveled.
``I don't know,'' Annabeth said. ``But that was really a nice thing you told him (<font color='blue'><b>Grover</b></font>).''
``I meant it.''
We rode in silence for a few miles, bumping around on the feed sacks. The zebra munched a
turnip. The lion licked the last of the hamburger meat off his (<font color='blue'><b>Grover</b></font>) lips and looked at me hopefully.
Annabeth rubbed her (<font color='blue'><b>Grover</b></font>) necklace like she (<font color='blue'><b>Grover</b></font>) was thinking deep, strategic thoughts.
``That pine-tree bead,'' I said. ``Is that from your first year?''
She (<font color='blue'><b>Grover</b></font>) looked. She (<font color='blue'><b>Grover</b></font>) hadn't realized what she (<font color='blue'><b>Grover</b></font>) was doing.
``Yeah,'' she (<font color='blue'><b>Grover</b></font>) said. ``Every August, the counselors pick the most important event of the summer, and
they paint it on that year's beads. I've got Thalia's pine tree, a Greek trireme on fire, a centaur in a
prom dress-now that was a weird summer....''
``And the college ring is your father's?''
``That's none of your-'' She (<font color='blue'><b>Grover</b></font>) stopped herself. ``Yeah. Yeah, it is.''
``You don't have to tell me.''
``No ... it's okay.'' She (<font color='blue'><b>Grover</b></font>) took a shaky breath. ``My dad sent it to me folded up in a letter, two
summers ago. The ring was, like, his (<font color='blue'><b>dad</b></font>) main keepsake from Athena. He (<font color='blue'><b>dad</b></font>) wouldn't have gotten through
his (<font color='blue'><b>dad</b></font>) doctoral program at Harvard without her (<font color='blue'><b>Athena</b></font>).... That's a long story. Anyway, he (<font color='blue'><b>dad</b></font>) said he (<font color='blue'><b>dad</b></font>) wanted me to
have it. He (<font color='blue'><b>dad</b></font>) apologized for being a jerk, said he (<font color='blue'><b>dad</b></font>) loved me and missed me. He (<font color='blue'><b>dad</b></font>) wanted me to come
home and live with him (<font color='blue'><b>dad</b></font>).''
``That doesn't sound so bad.''
``Yeah, well... the problem was, I believed him (<font color='blue'><b>dad</b></font>). I tried to go home for that school year, but my
stepmom was the same as ever. She (<font color='blue'><b>Athena</b></font>) didn't want her (<font color='blue'><b>Athena</b></font>) kids put in danger by living with a freak.
Monsters attacked. We argued. Monsters attacked. We argued. I didn't even make it through winter
break. I called Chiron and came right back to Camp Half-Blood.''
``You think you'll ever try living with your dad again?''
She (<font color='blue'><b>Grover</b></font>) wouldn't meet my eyes. ``Please. I'm not into self-inflicted pain.''
``You shouldn't give up,'' I told her (<font color='blue'><b>Grover</b></font>). ``You should write him (<font color='blue'><b>dad</b></font>) a letter or something.''
``Thanks for the advice,'' she (<font color='blue'><b>Grover</b></font>) said coldly, <div class="bookquote">``but my father's made his (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) choice about who he (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) wants to
live with.''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>We passed another few miles of silence.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``So if the gods fight,''  (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div>I said, <div class="bookquote">``will things line up the way they did with the Trojan War? Will it be
Athena versus Poseidon?''
 (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div>She (<font color='blue'><b>Grover</b></font>) put her (<font color='blue'><b>Grover</b></font>) head against the backpack Ares had given us, and closed her (<font color='blue'><b>Grover</b></font>) eyes. <div class="bookquote">``I don't know what
my mom will do. I just know I'll fight next to you.''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``Why?''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``Because you're my friend, Seaweed Brain. Any more stupid questions?''
 (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div>I couldn't think of an answer for that. Fortunately I didn't have to. Annabeth was asleep.
I had trouble following her (<font color='blue'><b>Grover</b></font>) example, with Grover snoring and an albino lion staring hungrily at
me, but eventually I closed my eyes.
***
My nightmare started out as something I'd dreamed a million times before: I was being forced to
take a standardized test while wearing a straitjacket. All the other kids were going out to recess, and
the teacher kept saying, Come on, Percy. You're not stupid, are you? Pick up your pencil.
Then the dream strayed from the usual.
I looked over at the next desk and saw a girl sitting there, also wearing a straitjacket. She (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) was my
age, with unruly black, punk-style hair, dark eyeliner around her (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) stormy green eyes, and freckles
across her (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) nose. Somehow, I knew who she (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) was. She (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) was Thalia, daughter of Zeus.
She (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) struggled against the straitjacket, glared at me in frustration, and snapped, Well, Seaweed
Brain? One of us has to get out of here.
She (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>)'s right, my dream-self thought. I'm going back to that cavern. I'm going to give Hades a piece
of my mind.
The straitjacket melted off me. I fell through the classroom floor. The teacher's voice changed
until it was cold and evil, echoing from the depths of a great chasm.
Percy Jackson, it said. Yes, the exchange went well, 1 see.
I was back in the dark cavern, spirits of the dead drifting around me. Unseen in the pit, the
monstrous thing was speaking, but this time it wasn't addressing me. The numbing power of its voice
seemed directed somewhere else.
And he (<font color='blue'><b>Jackson</b></font>) suspects nothing? it asked.
Another voice, one I almost recognized, answered at my shoulder. Nothing, my lord. He (<font color='blue'><b>lord</b></font>) is as
ignorant as the rest.
I looked over, but no one was there. The speaker was invisible.
Deception upon deception, the thing in the pit mused aloud. Excellent.
Truly, my lord, said the voice next to me, you are well-named the Crooked One. But was it really
necessary? I could have brought you what I stole directly You? the monster said in scorn. You have already shown your limits. You would have failed me
completely had I not intervened.
But, my lordPeace, little servant. Our six months have bought us much. Zeus's anger has grown. Poseidon has
played his (<font color='blue'><b>Zeus</b></font>) most desperate card. Now we shall use it against him (<font color='blue'><b>Zeus</b></font>). Shortly you shall have the reward
you wish, and your revenge. As soon as both items are delivered into my hands ... but wait. He (<font color='blue'><b>Zeus</b></font>) is
here.
What? The invisible servant suddenly sounded tense. You summoned him (<font color='blue'><b>servant</b></font>), my lord?
No. The full force of the monsters attention was now pouring over me, freezing me in place. Blast
his (<font color='blue'><b>servant</b></font>) father's blood-he is too changeable, too unpredictable. The boy brought himself hither.
Impossible! the servant cried.

<p/>For a weakling such as you, perhaps, the voice snarled. Then its cold power turned back on me.
So ... you wish to dream of your quest, young half-blood? Then I will oblige.
The scene changed.
I was standing in a vast throne room with black marble walls and bronze floors. The empty,
horrid throne was made from human bones fused together. Standing at the foot of the dais was my
mother, frozen in shimmering golden light, her (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) arms outstretched.
I tried to step toward her (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>), but my legs wouldn't move. I reached for her (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>), only to realize that my
hands were withering to bones. Grinning skeletons in Greek armor crowded around me, draping me
with silk robes, wreathing my head with laurels that smoked with Chimera poison, burning into my
scalp.
The evil voice began to laugh. Hail, the conquering hero!
I woke with a start.
Grover was shaking my shoulder. <div class="bookquote">``The truck's stopped,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Grover</b></font>) said. <div class="bookquote">``We think they're coming to
check on the animals.''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``Hide!''  (<font color='red'><b>Annabeth/ANNABETH</b></font>)</div>Annabeth hissed.
She (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) had it easy. She (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) just put on her (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) magic cap and disappeared. Grover and I had to dive behind
feed sacks and hope we looked like turnips.
The trailer doors creaked open. Sunlight and heat poured in.
<div class="bookquote">``Man!''  (<font color='red'><b>the truckers</b></font>)</div>one of the truckers said, waving his (<font color='blue'><b>Grover</b></font>) hand in front of his (<font color='blue'><b>Grover</b></font>) ugly nose. <div class="bookquote">``I wish I hauled
appliances.''  (<font color='red'><b>He</b></font>)</div>He (<font color='blue'><b>Grover</b></font>) climbed inside and poured some water from a jug into the animals' dishes.
<div class="bookquote">``You hot, big boy?''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Grover</b></font>) asked the lion, then splashed the rest of the bucket right in the lion's face.
The lion roared in indignation.
<div class="bookquote">``Yeah, yeah, yeah,''  (<font color='red'><b>the man</b></font>)</div>the man said.
Next to me, under the turnip sacks, Grover tensed. For a peace-loving herbivore, he (<font color='blue'><b>Grover</b></font>) looked
downright murderous.
The trucker threw the antelope a squashed-looking Happy Meal bag. He (<font color='blue'><b>Grover</b></font>) smirked at the zebra.
<div class="bookquote">``How ya doin', Stripes? Least we'll be getting rid of you this stop. You like magic shows? You're
gonna love this one. They're gonna saw you in half!''
 (<font color='red'><b>The zebra</b></font>)</div>The zebra, wild-eyed with fear, looked straight at me.
There was no sound, but as clear as day, I heard it say: Free me, lord. Please.
I was too stunned to react.
There was a loud knock, knock, knock on the side of the trailer.
The trucker inside with us yelled, <div class="bookquote">``What do you want, Eddie?''
 (<font color='red'><b>The trucker</b></font>)</div>A voice outside-it must've been Eddie's-shouted back, <div class="bookquote">``Maurice? What'd ya say?''
 (<font color='red'><b>Eddie</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``What are you banging for?''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>Knock, knock, knock.
Outside, Eddie yelled, <div class="bookquote">``What banging?''
 (<font color='red'><b>Eddie</b></font>)</div>Our guy Maurice rolled his (<font color='blue'><b>Maurice</b></font>) eyes and went back outside, cursing at Eddie for being an idiot.
A second later, Annabeth appeared next to me. She (<font color='blue'><b>Annabeth</b></font>) must've done the banging to get Maurice out
of the trailer. She (<font color='blue'><b>Annabeth</b></font>) said, <div class="bookquote">``This transport business can't be legal.''
 (<font color='red'><b>She</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``No kidding,''  (<font color='red'><b>Grover/Grover Underwood/GROVER</b></font>)</div>Grover said. He (<font color='blue'><b>Grover</b></font>) paused, as if listening. <div class="bookquote">``The lion says these guys are animal
smugglers!''
 (<font color='red'><b>the zebra</b></font>)</div>That's right, the zebra's voice said in my mind.
<div class="bookquote">``We've got to free them!''  (<font color='red'><b>Grover/Grover Underwood/GROVER</b></font>)</div>Grover said. He (<font color='blue'><b>Grover</b></font>) and Annabeth both looked at me, waiting for my lead.
I'd heard the zebra talk, but not the lion. Why? Maybe it was another learning disability ... I could

<p/>only understand zebras? Then I thought: horses. What had Annabeth said about Poseidon creating
horses? Was a zebra close enough to a horse? Was that why I could understand it?
The zebra said, Open my cage, lord. Please. I'll be fine after that.
Outside, Eddie and Maurice were still yelling at each other, but I knew they'd be coming inside to
torment the animals again any minute. I grabbed Riptide and slashed the lock off the zebra's cage.
The zebra burst out. It turned to me and bowed. Thank you, lord.
Grover held up his (<font color='blue'><b>Grover</b></font>) hands and said something to the zebra in goat talk, like a blessing.
Just as Maurice was poking his (<font color='blue'><b>Maurice</b></font>) head back inside to check out the noise, the zebra leaped over him (<font color='blue'><b>Maurice</b></font>)
and into the street. There was yelling and screaming and cars honking. We rushed to the doors of the
trailer in time to see the zebra galloping down a wide boulevard lined with hotels and casinos and
neon signs. We'd just released a zebra in Las Vegas.
Maurice and Eddie ran after it, with a few policemen running after them, shouting, <div class="bookquote">``Hey! You
need a permit for that!''
 (<font color='red'><b>a policemen</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``Now would be a good time to leave,''  (<font color='red'><b>Annabeth/ANNABETH</b></font>)</div>Annabeth said.
<div class="bookquote">``The other animals first,''  (<font color='red'><b>Grover/Grover Underwood/GROVER</b></font>)</div>Grover said.
I cut the locks with my sword. Grover raised his (<font color='blue'><b>Grover</b></font>) hands and spoke the same goat-blessing he (<font color='blue'><b>Grover</b></font>)'d
used for the zebra.
<div class="bookquote">``Good luck,''  (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div>I told the animals. The antelope and the lion burst out of their cages and went off
together into the streets.
Some tourists screamed. Most just backed off and took pictures, probably thinking it was some
kind of stunt by one of the casinos.
<div class="bookquote">``Will the animals be okay?''  (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div>I asked Grover. ``I mean, the desert and all-``
<div class="bookquote">``Don't worry,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Grover</b></font>) said. <div class="bookquote">``I placed a satyr's sanctuary on them.''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``Meaning?''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``Meaning they'll reach the wild safely,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Grover</b></font>) said. <div class="bookquote">``They'll find water, food, shade, whatever they
need until they find a safe place to live.''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``Why can't you place a blessing like that on us?''  (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div>I asked.
<div class="bookquote">``It only works on wild animals.''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``So it would only affect Percy,''  (<font color='red'><b>Annabeth/ANNABETH</b></font>)</div>Annabeth reasoned.
<div class="bookquote">``Hey!''  (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div>I protested.
<div class="bookquote">``Kidding,''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Grover</b></font>) said. <div class="bookquote">``Come on. Let's get out of this filthy truck.''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>We stumbled out into the desert afternoon. It was a hundred and ten degrees, easy, and we must've
looked like deep-fried vagrants, but everybody was too interested in the wild animals to pay us much
attention.
We passed the Monte Carlo and the MGM. We passed pyramids, a pirate ship, and the Statue of
Liberty, which was a pretty small replica, but still made me homesick.
I wasn't sure what we were looking for. Maybe just a place to get out of the heat for a few
minutes, find a sandwich and a glass of lemonade, make a new plan for getting west.
We must have taken a wrong turn, because we found ourselves at a dead end, standing in front of
the Lotus Hotel and Casino. The entrance was a huge neon flower, the petals lighting up and blinking.
No one was going in or out, but the glittering chrome doors were open, spilling out air-conditioning
that smelled like flowers-lotus blossom, maybe. I'd never smelled one, so I wasn't sure.
The doorman smiled at us. <div class="bookquote">``Hey, kids. You look tired. You want to come in and sit down?''
 (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div>I'd learned to be suspicious, the last week or so. I figured anybody might be a monster or a god.
You just couldn't tell. But this guy was normal. One look at him (<font color='blue'><b>guy</b></font>), and I could see. Besides, I was so

<p/>relieved to hear somebody who sounded sympathetic that I nodded and said we'd love to come in.
Inside, we took one look around, and Grover said, <div class="bookquote">``Whoa.''
 (<font color='red'><b>Grover/Grover Underwood/GROVER</b></font>)</div>The whole lobby was a giant game room. And I'm not talking about cheesy old Pac-Man games or
slot machines. There was an indoor waterslide snaking around the glass elevator, which went straight
up at least forty floors. There was a climbing wall on the side of one building, and an indoor bungeejumping bridge. There were virtual-reality suits with working laser guns. And hundreds of video
games, each one the size of a widescreen TV. Basically, you name it, this place had it. There were a
few other kids playing, but not that many. No waiting for any of the games. There were waitresses and
snack bars all around, serving every kind of food you can imagine.
<div class="bookquote">``Hey!''  (<font color='red'><b>a bellhop</b></font>)</div>a bellhop said. At least I guessed he (<font color='blue'><b>bellhop</b></font>) was a bellhop. He (<font color='blue'><b>bellhop</b></font>) wore a white-and-yellow
Hawaiian shirt with lotus designs, shorts, and flip-flops. <div class="bookquote">``Welcome to the Lotus Casino. Here's your
room key.''
 (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div>I stammered, <div class="bookquote">``Um, but...''
 (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``No, no,''  (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>bellhop</b></font>) said, laughing. <div class="bookquote">``The bill's taken care of. No extra charges, no tips. Just go on up to
the top floor, loom 4001. If you need anything, like extra bubbles for the hot tub, or skeet targets for
the shooting range, or whatever, just call the front desk. Here are your LotusCash cards. They work in
the restaurants and on all the games and rides.''
 (<font color='red'><b>He</b></font>)</div>He (<font color='blue'><b>bellhop</b></font>) handed us each a green plastic credit card.
I knew there must be some mistake. Obviously he (<font color='blue'><b>bellhop</b></font>) thought we were some millionaire's kids. But I
took the card and said, <div class="bookquote">``How much is on here?''
 (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div>His (<font color='blue'><b>bellhop</b></font>) eyebrows knit together. <div class="bookquote">``What do you mean?''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``I mean, when does it run out of cash?''
 (<font color='red'><b>He</b></font>)</div>He (<font color='blue'><b>bellhop</b></font>) laughed. <div class="bookquote">``Oh, you're making a joke. Hey, that's cool. Enjoy your stay.''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>We took the elevator upstairs and checked out our room. It was a suite with three separate
bedrooms and a bar stocked with candy, sodas, and chips. A hotline to room service. Fluffy towels
and water beds with feather pillows. A big-screen television with satellite and high-speed Internet.
The balcony had its own hot tub, and sure enough, there was a skeet-shooting machine and a shotgun,
so you could launch clay pigeons right out over the Las Vegas skyline and plug them with your gun. I
didn't see how that could be legal, but I thought it was pretty cool. The view over the Strip and the
desert was amazing, though I doubted we'd ever find time to look at the view with a room like this.
<div class="bookquote">``Oh, goodness,''  (<font color='red'><b>Annabeth/ANNABETH</b></font>)</div>Annabeth said. <div class="bookquote">``This place is ...''
 (<font color='red'><b>Grover/Grover Underwood/GROVER</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``Sweet,''  (<font color='red'><b>Grover/Grover Underwood/GROVER</b></font>)</div>Grover said. <div class="bookquote">``Absolutely sweet.''
 (<font color='red'><b>me</b></font>)</div>There were clothes in the closet, and they fit me. I frowned, thinking that this was a little strange.
I threw Ares's backpack in the trash can. Wouldn't need that anymore. When we left, I could just
charge a new one at the hotel store.
I took a shower, which felt awesome after a week of grimy travel. I changed clothes, ate a bag of
chips, drank three Cokes, and came out feeling better than I had in a long time. In the back of my mind,
some small problem kept nagging me. I'd had a dream or something ... I needed to talk to my friends.
But I was sure it could wait.
I came out of the bedroom and found that Annabeth and Grover had also showered and changed
clothes. Grover was eating potato chips to his (<font color='blue'><b>Grover</b></font>) heart's content, while Annabeth cranked up the
National Geographic Channel.
<div class="bookquote">``All those stations,''  (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div>I told her (<font color='blue'><b>I</b></font>), <div class="bookquote">``and you turn on National Geographic. Are you insane?''
 (<font color='red'><b>her</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``It's interesting.''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``I feel good,''  (<font color='red'><b>Grover/Grover Underwood/GROVER</b></font>)</div>Grover said. <div class="bookquote">``I love this place.''

 (<font color='red'><b>him</b></font>)</div><p/>Without his (<font color='blue'><b>Grover</b></font>) even realizing it, the wings sprouted out of his (<font color='blue'><b>Grover</b></font>) shoes and lifted him (<font color='blue'><b>Grover</b></font>) a foot off the
ground, then back down again.
<div class="bookquote">``So what now?''  (<font color='red'><b>Annabeth/ANNABETH</b></font>)</div>Annabeth asked. <div class="bookquote">``Sleep?''
 (<font color='red'><b>Grover/Grover Underwood/GROVER</b></font>)</div>Grover and I looked at each other and grinned. We both held up our green plastic LotusCash
cards.
<div class="bookquote">``Play time,''  (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div>I said.
I couldn't remember the last time I had so much fun. I came from a relatively poor family. Our
idea of a splurge was eating out at Burger King and renting a video. A five-star Vegas hotel? Forget
it.
I bungee-jumped the lobby five or six times, did the waterslide, snowboarded the artificial ski
slope, and played virtual-reality laser tag and FBI sharpshooter. I saw Grover a few times, going
from game to game. He (<font color='blue'><b>Grover</b></font>) really liked the reverse hunter thing-where the deer go out and shoot the
rednecks. I saw Annabeth playing trivia games and other brainiac stuff. They had this huge 3-D sim
game where you build your own city, and you could actually see the holographic buildings rise on the
display board. I didn't think much of it, but Annabeth loved it.
I'm not sure when I first realized something was wrong.
Probably, it was when I noticed the guy standing next to me at VR sharpshooters. He (<font color='blue'><b>guy</b></font>) was about
thirteen, I guess, but his (<font color='blue'><b>guy</b></font>) clothes were weird. I thought he (<font color='blue'><b>guy</b></font>) was some Elvis impersonator's son. He (<font color='blue'><b>guy</b></font>)
wore bell-bottom jeans and a red T-shirt with black piping, and his (<font color='blue'><b>guy</b></font>) hair was permed and gelled like a
New Jersey girl's on homecoming night.
We played a game of sharpshooters together and he (<font color='blue'><b>guy</b></font>) said, <div class="bookquote">``Groovy, man. Been here two weeks,
and the games keep getting better and better.''
 (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>Groovy?
Later, while we were talking, I said something was <div class="bookquote">``sick,''  (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div>and he (<font color='blue'><b>guy</b></font>) looked at me kind of startled,
as if he (<font color='blue'><b>guy</b></font>)'d never heard the word used that way before.
He (<font color='blue'><b>guy</b></font>) said his (<font color='blue'><b>guy</b></font>) name was Darrin, but as soon as I started asking him (<font color='blue'><b>guy</b></font>) questions he (<font color='blue'><b>guy</b></font>) got bored with me
and started to go back to the computer screen.
I said, <div class="bookquote">``Hey, Darrin?''
 (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``What?''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``What year is it?''
 (<font color='red'><b>He</b></font>)</div>He (<font color='blue'><b>guy</b></font>) frowned at me. <div class="bookquote">``In the game?''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``No. In real life.''
 (<font color='red'><b>He</b></font>)</div>He (<font color='blue'><b>guy</b></font>) had to think about it. <div class="bookquote">``1977.''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``No,''  (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div>I said, getting a little scared. <div class="bookquote">``Really.''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``Hey, man. Bad vibes. I got a game happening.''
 (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>After that he (<font color='blue'><b>guy</b></font>) totally ignored me.
I started talking to people, and I found it wasn't easy. They were glued to the TV screen, or the
video game, or their food, or whatever. I found a guy who told me it was 1985. Another guy told me it
was 1993. They all claimed they hadn't been in here very long, a few days, a few weeks at most.
They didn't really know and they didn't care.
Then it occurred to me: how long had I been here? It seemed like only a couple of hours, but was
it?
I tried to remember why we were here. We were going to Los Angeles. We were supposed to find
the entrance to the Underworld. My mother ... for a scary second, I had trouble remembering her (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>)
name. Sally. Sally Jackson. I had to find her (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>). I had to stop Hades from causing World War III.

<p/>I found Annabeth still building her (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) city.
<div class="bookquote">``Come on,''  (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div>I told her (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>). <div class="bookquote">``We've got to get out of here.''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>No response.
I shook her (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>). <div class="bookquote">``Annabeth?''
 (<font color='red'><b>She</b></font>)</div>She (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) looked up, annoyed. ``What?
``We need to leave.''
``Leave? What are you talking about? I've just got the towers-``
``This place is a trap.''
She (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) didn't respond until I shook her (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) again. ``What?''
``Listen. The Underworld. Our quest!''
``Oh, come on, Percy. Just a few more minutes.''
``Annabeth, there are people here from 1977. Kids who have never aged. You check in, and you
stay forever.''
``So?'' she (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) asked. ``Can you imagine a better place?''
I grabbed her (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) wrist and yanked her (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) away from the game.
``Hey!'' She (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) screamed and hit me, but nobody else even bothered looking at us. They were too
busy.
I made her (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) look directly in my eyes. I said, ``Spiders. Large, hairy spiders.''
That jarred her (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>). Her (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) vision cleared. ``Oh my gods,'' she (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) said. ``How long have we-``
``I don't know, but we've got to find Grover.''
We went searching, and found him (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) still playing Virtual Deer Hunter.
``Grover!'' we both shouted.
He (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) said, ``Die, human! Die, silly polluting nasty person!''
``Grover!''
He (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) turned the plastic gun on me and started clicking, as if I were just another image from the
screen.
I looked at Annabeth, and together we took Grover by the arms and dragged him (<font color='blue'><b>Grover</b></font>) away. His (<font color='blue'><b>Grover</b></font>) flying
shoes sprang to life and started tugging his (<font color='blue'><b>Grover</b></font>) legs in the other direction as he (<font color='blue'><b>Grover</b></font>) shouted, ``No! I just got to
a new level! No!''
The Lotus bellhop hurried up to us. ``Well, now, are you ready for your platinum cards?''
``We're leaving,'' I told him (<font color='blue'><b>Grover</b></font>).
``Such a shame,'' he (<font color='blue'><b>Grover</b></font>) said, and I got the feeling that he (<font color='blue'><b>Grover</b></font>) really meant it, that we'd be breaking his (<font color='blue'><b>Grover</b></font>)
heart if we went. ``We just added an entire new floor full of games for platinum-card members.''
He (<font color='blue'><b>Grover</b></font>) held out the cards, and I wanted one. I knew that if I took one, I'd never leave. I'd stay here,
happy forever, playing games forever, and soon I'd forget my mom, and my quest, and maybe even my
own name. I'd be playing virtual rifleman with groovy Disco Darrin forever.
Grover reached for the card, but Annabeth yanked back his (<font color='blue'><b>Grover</b></font>) arm and said, <div class="bookquote">``No, thanks.''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>We walked toward the door, and as we did, the smell of the food and the sounds of the games
seemed to get more and more inviting. I thought about our room upstairs. We could just stay the night,
sleep in a real bed for once....
Then we burst through the doors of the Lotus Casino and ran down the sidewalk. It felt like
afternoon, about the same time of day we'd gone into the casino, but something was wrong. The
weather had completely changed. It was stormy, with heat lightning flashing out in the desert.
Ares's backpack was slung over my shoulder, which was odd, because I was sure I had thrown it
in the trash can in room 4001, but at the moment I had other problems to worry about.

<p/>I ran to the nearest newspaper stand and read the year first. Thank the gods, it was the same year it
had been when we went in. Then I noticed the date: June twentieth.
We had been in the Lotus Casino for five days.
We had only one day left until the summer solstice. One day to complete our quest.

<p/>Percy Jackson 1 - The Lightning Thief
17 WE SHOP FOR
WATER BEDS
It was Annabeth's idea.
She (<font color='blue'><b>it</b></font>) loaded us into the back of a Vegas taxi as if we actually had money, and told the driver, <div class="bookquote">``Los
Angeles, please.''
 (<font color='red'><b>the driver</b></font>)</div>The cabbie chewed his (<font color='blue'><b>cabbie</b></font>) cigar and sized us up. <div class="bookquote">``That's three hundred miles. For that, you gotta pay
up front.''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``You accept casino debit cards?''  (<font color='red'><b>Annabeth/ANNABETH</b></font>)</div>Annabeth asked.
He (<font color='blue'><b>cabbie</b></font>) shrugged. <div class="bookquote">``Some of `em. Same as credit cards. I gotta swipe `em through first.''
 (<font color='red'><b>Annabeth/ANNABETH</b></font>)</div>Annabeth handed him (<font color='blue'><b>cabbie</b></font>) her (<font color='blue'><b>it</b></font>) green LotusCash card.
He (<font color='blue'><b>cabbie</b></font>) looked at it skeptically.
<div class="bookquote">``Swipe it,''  (<font color='red'><b>Annabeth/ANNABETH</b></font>)</div>Annabeth invited.
He (<font color='blue'><b>cabbie</b></font>) did.
His (<font color='blue'><b>cabbie</b></font>) meter machine started rattling. The lights flashed. Finally an infinity symbol came up next to
the dollar sign.
The cigar fell out of the driver's mouth. He (<font color='blue'><b>driver</b></font>) looked back at us, his (<font color='blue'><b>driver</b></font>) eyes wide. <div class="bookquote">``Where to in Los
Angeles... uh, Your Highness?''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``The Santa Monica Pier.''  (<font color='red'><b>Annabeth/ANNABETH</b></font>)</div>Annabeth sat up a little straighter. I could tell she (<font color='blue'><b>it</b></font>) liked the <div class="bookquote">``Your
Highness''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>thing. <div class="bookquote">``Get us there fast, and you can keep the change.''
 (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>Maybe she (<font color='blue'><b>it</b></font>) shouldn't have told him (<font color='blue'><b>driver</b></font>) that. The cab's speedometer never dipped below ninety-five
the whole way through the Mojave Desert.
On the road, we had plenty of time to talk. I told Annabeth and Grover about my latest dream, but
the details got sketchier the more I tried to remember them. The Lotus Casino seemed to have shortcircuited my memory. I couldn't recall what the invisible servant's voice had sounded like, though I
was sure it was somebody I knew. The servant had called the monster in the pit something other than
<div class="bookquote">``my lord''  (<font color='red'><b>the monster</b></font>)</div>... some special name or title....
<div class="bookquote">``The Silent One?''  (<font color='red'><b>Annabeth/ANNABETH</b></font>)</div>Annabeth suggested. <div class="bookquote">``The Rich One? Both of those are nicknames for Hades.''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``Maybe ...''  (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div>I said, though neither sounded quite right.
<div class="bookquote">``That throne room sounds like Hades's,''  (<font color='red'><b>Grover/Grover Underwood/GROVER</b></font>)</div>Grover said. <div class="bookquote">``That's the way it's usually described.''
 (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div>I shook my head. <div class="bookquote">``Something's wrong. The throne room wasn't the main part of the dream. And
that voice from the pit ... I don't know. It just didn't feel like a god's voice.''
 (<font color='red'><b>Annabeth/ANNABETH</b></font>)</div>Annabeth's eyes widened.
<div class="bookquote">``What?''  (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div>I asked.
``Oh ... nothing. I was just-No, it has to be Hades. Maybe he (<font color='blue'><b>god</b></font>) sent this thief, this invisible person,
to get the master bolt, and something went wrong-``
<div class="bookquote">``Like what?''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``I-I don't know,''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>it</b></font>) said. ``But if he (<font color='blue'><b>god</b></font>) stole Zeus's symbol of power from Olympus, and the gods
were hunting him (<font color='blue'><b>god</b></font>), I mean, a lot of things could go wrong. So this thief had to hide the bolt, or he (<font color='blue'><b>thief</b></font>) lost it
somehow. Anyway, he (<font color='blue'><b>thief</b></font>) failed to bring it to Hades. That's what the voice said in your dream, right?
The guy failed. That would explain what the Furies were searching for when they came after us on the

<p/>bus. Maybe they thought we had retrieved the bolt.''
I wasn't sure what was wrong with her (<font color='blue'><b>it</b></font>). She (<font color='blue'><b>it</b></font>) looked pale.
``But if I'd already retrieved the bolt,'' I said, ``why would I be traveling to the Underworld?''
``To threaten Hades,'' Grover suggested. ``To bribe or blackmail him (<font color='blue'><b>guy</b></font>) into getting your mom back.''
I whistled. ``You have evil thoughts for a goat.''
``Why, thank you.''
``But the thing in the pit said it was waiting for two items,'' I said. ``If the master bolt is one,
what's the other?''
Grover shook his (<font color='blue'><b>Grover</b></font>) head, clearly mystified.
Annabeth was looking at me as if she (<font color='blue'><b>it</b></font>) knew my next question, and was silently willing me not to
ask it.
``You have an idea what might be in that pit, don't you?'' I asked her (<font color='blue'><b>it</b></font>). ``I mean, if it isn't Hades?''
``Percy ... let's not talk about it. Because if it isn't Hades ... No. It has to be Hades.''
Wasteland rolled by. We passed a sign that said CALIFORNIA STATE LINE, 12 MILES.
I got the feeling I was missing one simple, critical piece of information. It was like when I stared
at a common word I should know, but I couldn't make sense of it because one or two letters were
floating around. The more I thought about my quest, the more I was sure that confronting Hades wasn't
the real answer. There was something else going on, something even more dangerous.
The problem was: we were hurtling toward the Underworld at ninety-five miles an hour, betting
that Hades had the master bolt. If we got there and found out we were wrong, we wouldn't have time
to correct ourselves. The solstice deadline would pass and war would begin.
``The answer is in the Underworld,'' Annabeth assured me. ``You saw spirits of the dead, Percy.
There's only one place that could be. We're doing the right thing.''
She (<font color='blue'><b>it</b></font>) tried to boost our morale by suggesting clever strategies for getting into the Land of the Dead,
but my heart wasn't in it. There were just too many unknown factors. It was like cramming for a test
without knowing the subject. And believe me, I'd done that enough times.
The cab sped west. Every gust of wind through Death Valley sounded like a spirit of the dead.
Every time the brakes hissed on an eighteen-wheeler, it reminded me of Echidna's reptilian voice.
At sunset, the taxi dropped us at the beach in Santa Monica. It looked exactly the way L.A.
beaches do in the movies, only it smelled worse. There were carnival rides lining the Pier, palm trees
lining the sidewalks, homeless guys sleeping in the sand dunes, and surfer dudes waiting for the
perfect wave.
Grover, Annabeth, and I walked down to the edge of the surf.
``What now?'' Annabeth asked.
The Pacific was turning gold in the setting sun. I thought about how long it had been since I'd
stood on the beach at Montauk, on the opposite side of the country, looking out at a different sea.
How could there be a god who could control all that? What did my science teacher used to saytwo-thirds of the earth's surface was covered in water? How could I be the son of someone that
powerful?
I stepped into the surf
``Percy?'' Annabeth said. ``What are you doing?''
I kept walking, up to my waist, then my chest.
She (<font color='blue'><b>I</b></font>) called after me, ``You know how polluted that water is? There're all kinds of toxic-``
That's when my head went under.
I held my breath at first. It's difficult to intentionally inhale water. Finally I couldn't stand it

<p/>anymore. I gasped. Sure enough, I could breathe normally.
I walked down into the shoals. I shouldn't have been able to see through the murk, but somehow I
could tell where everything was. I could sense the rolling texture of the bottom. I could make out
sand-dollar colonies dotting the sandbars. I could even see the currents, warm and cold streams
swirling together.
I felt something rub against my leg. I looked down and almost shot out of the water like a ballistic
missile. Sliding along beside me was a five-foot-long mako shark.
But the thing wasn't attacking. It was nuzzling me. Heeling like a dog. Tentatively, I touched its
dorsal fin. It bucked a little, as if inviting me to hold tighter. I grabbed the fin with both hands. It took
off, pulling me along. The shark carried me down into the darkness. It deposited me at the edge of the
ocean proper, where the sand bank dropped off into a huge chasm. It was like standing on the rim of
the Grand Canyon at midnight, not being able to see much, but knowing the void was right there.
The surface shimmered maybe a hundred and fifty feet above. I knew I should've been crushed by
the pressure. Then again, I shouldn't have been able to breathe. I wondered if there was a limit to
how deep I could go, if I could sink straight to the bottom of the Pacific.
Then I saw something glimmering in the darkness below, growing bigger and brighter as it rose
toward me. A woman's voice, like my mother's, called: <div class="bookquote">``Percy Jackson.''
 (<font color='red'><b>mother</b></font>)</div>As she (<font color='blue'><b>I</b></font>) got closer, her (<font color='blue'><b>I</b></font>) shape became clearer. She (<font color='blue'><b>I</b></font>) had flowing black hair, a dress made of green
silk. Light flickered around her (<font color='blue'><b>I</b></font>), and her (<font color='blue'><b>I</b></font>) eyes were so distractingly beautiful I hardly noticed the
stallion-sized sea horse she (<font color='blue'><b>I</b></font>) was riding.
She (<font color='blue'><b>I</b></font>) dismounted. The sea horse and the mako shark whisked off and started playing something that
looked like tag. The underwater lady smiled at me. <div class="bookquote">``You've come far, Percy Jackson. Well done.''
 (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div>I wasn't quite sure what to do, so I bowed. <div class="bookquote">``You're the woman who spoke to me in the
Mississippi River.''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``Yes, child. I am a Nereid, a spirit of the sea. It was not easy to appear so far upriver, but the
naiads, my freshwater cousins, helped sustain my life force. They honor Lord Poseidon, though they
do not serve in his (<font color='blue'><b>Lord</b></font>) court.''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``And ... you serve in Poseidon's court?''
 (<font color='red'><b>She</b></font>)</div>She (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) nodded. <div class="bookquote">``It has been many years since a child of the Sea God has been born. We have
watched you with great interest.''
 (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div>Suddenly I remembered faces in the waves off Montauk Beach when I was a little boy, reflections
of smiling women. Like so many of the weird things in my life, I'd never given it much thought before.
<div class="bookquote">``If my father is so interested in me,''  (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div>I said, <div class="bookquote">``why isn't he (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) here? Why doesn't he (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) speak to me?''
 (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div>A cold current rose out of the depths.
<div class="bookquote">``Do not judge the Lord of the Sea too harshly,''  (<font color='red'><b>me</b></font>)</div>the Nereid told me. <div class="bookquote">``He (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) stands at the brink of an
unwanted war. He (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) has much to occupy his (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) time. Besides, he (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) is forbidden to help you directly. The
gods may not show such favoritism.''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``Even to their own children?''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``Especially to them. The gods can work by indirect influence only. That is why I give you a
warning, and a gift.''
 (<font color='red'><b>She</b></font>)</div>She (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) held out her (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) hand. Three white pearls flashed in her (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) palm.
<div class="bookquote">``I know you journey to Hades's realm,''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) said. <div class="bookquote">``Few mortals have ever done this and survived:
Orpheus, who had great music skill; Hercules, who had great strength; Houdini, who could escape
even the depths of Tartarus. Do you have these talents?''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``Urn ... no, ma’am.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Ah, but you have something else, Percy. You have gifts you have only begun to know. The
oracles have foretold a great and terrible future for you, should you survive to manhood. Poseidon
would not have you die before your time. Therefore take these, and when you are in need, smash a
pearl at your feet.''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``What will happen?''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``That,''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) said, <div class="bookquote">``depends on the need. But remember: what belongs to the sea will always return
to the sea.''
 (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``What about the warning?''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>Her (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) eyes flickered with green light. <div class="bookquote">``Go with what your heart tells you, or you will lose all.
Hades feeds on doubt and hopelessness. He (<font color='blue'><b>you</b></font>) will trick you if he (<font color='blue'><b>you</b></font>) can, make you mistrust your own
judgment. Once you are in his (<font color='blue'><b>you</b></font>) realm, he (<font color='blue'><b>you</b></font>) will never willingly let you leave. Keep faith. Good luck,
Percy Jackson.''
 (<font color='red'><b>She</b></font>)</div>She (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) summoned her (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) sea horse and rode toward the void.
<div class="bookquote">``Wait!''  (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div>I called. <div class="bookquote">``At the river, you said not to trust the gifts. What gifts?''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``Good-bye, young hero,''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) called back, her (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) voice fading into the depths. <div class="bookquote">``You must listen to
your heart.''  (<font color='red'><b>She</b></font>)</div>She (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) became a speck of glowing green, and then she (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) was gone.
I wanted to follow her (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) down into the darkness. I wanted to see the court of Poseidon. But I looked
up at the sunset darkening on the surface. My friends were waiting. We had so little time....
I kicked upward toward the shore.
When I reached the beach, my clothes dried instantly. I told Grover and Annabeth what had
happened, and showed them the pearls.
Annabeth grimaced. <div class="bookquote">``No gift comes without a price.''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``They were free.''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``No.''  (<font color='red'><b>She</b></font>)</div>She (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) shook her (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) head. ```There is no such thing as a free lunch.' That's an ancient Greek
saying that translated pretty well into American. There will be a price. You wait.''
On that happy thought, we turned our backs on the sea.
With some spare change from Ares's backpack, we took the bus into West Hollywood. I showed
the driver the Underworld address slip I'd taken from Aunty Em's Garden Gnome Emporium, but
he (<font color='blue'><b>driver</b></font>)'d never heard of DOA Recording Studios.
``You remind me of somebody I saw on TV,'' he (<font color='blue'><b>driver</b></font>) told me. ``You a child actor or something?''
``Uh ... I'm a stunt double ... for a lot of child actors.''
``Oh! That explains it.''
We thanked him (<font color='blue'><b>driver</b></font>) and got off quickly at the next stop.
We wandered for miles on foot, looking for DOA. Nobody seemed to know where it was. It
didn't appear in the phone book.
Twice, we ducked into alleys to avoid cop cars.
I froze in front of an appliance-store window because a television was playing an interview with
somebody who looked very familiar-my stepdad, Smelly Gabe. He (<font color='blue'><b>Gabe</b></font>) was talking to Barbara Walters-I
mean, as if he (<font color='blue'><b>Gabe</b></font>) were some kind of huge celebrity. She (<font color='blue'><b>Barbara</b></font>) was interviewing him (<font color='blue'><b>Gabe</b></font>) in our apartment, in the
middle of a poker game, and there was a young blond lady sitting next to him (<font color='blue'><b>Gabe</b></font>), patting his (<font color='blue'><b>Gabe</b></font>) hand.
A fake tear glistened on his (<font color='blue'><b>Gabe</b></font>) cheek. He (<font color='blue'><b>Gabe</b></font>) was saying, ``Honest, Ms. Walters, if it wasn't for Sugar
here, my grief counselor, I'd be a wreck. My stepson took everything I cared about. My wife ... my
Camaro ... I-I'm sorry. I have trouble talking about it.''
``There you have it, America.'' Barbara Walters turned to the camera. ``A man torn apart. An
adolescent boy with serious issues. Let me show you, again, the last known photo of this troubled

<p/>young fugitive, taken a week ago in Denver.''
The screen cut to a grainy shot of me, Annabeth, and Grover standing outside the Colorado diner,
talking to Ares.
``Who are the other children in this photo?'' Barbara Walters asked dramatically. ``Who is the man
with them? Is Percy Jackson a delinquent, a terrorist, or perhaps the brainwashed victim of a
frightening new cult? When we come back, we chat with a leading child psychologist. Stay tuned,
America.''
``C’mon,'' Grover told me. He (<font color='blue'><b>Grover</b></font>) hauled me away before I could punch a hole in the appliance-store
window.
It got dark, and hungry-looking characters started coming out on the streets to play. Now, don't get
me wrong. I'm a New Yorker. I don't scare easy. But L.A. had a totally different feel from New York.
Back home, everything seemed close. It didn't matter how big the city was, you could get anywhere
without getting lost. The street pattern and the subway made sense. There was a system to how things
worked. A kid could be safe as long as he (<font color='blue'><b>kid</b></font>) wasn't stupid.
L.A. wasn't like that. It was spread out, chaotic, hard to move around. It reminded me of Ares. It
wasn't enough for L.A. to be big; it had to prove it was big by being loud and strange and difficult to
navigate, too. I didn't know how we were ever going to find the entrance to the Underworld by
tomorrow, the summer solstice.
We walked past gangbangers, bums, and street hawkers, who looked at us like they were trying to
figure if we were worth the trouble of mugging.
As we hurried passed the entrance of an alley, a voice from the darkness said, ``Hey, you.''
Like an idiot, I stopped.
Before I knew it, we were surrounded. A gang of kids had circled us. Six of them in all-white
kids with expensive clothes and mean faces. Like the kids at Yancy Academy: rich brats playing at
being bad boys.
Instinctively, I uncapped Riptide.
When the sword appeared out of nowhere, the kids backed off, but their leader was either really
stupid or really brave, because he (<font color='blue'><b>leader</b></font>) kept coming at me with a switchblade.
I made the mistake of swinging.
The kid yelped. But he (<font color='blue'><b>kid</b></font>) must've been one hundred percent mortal, because the blade passed
harmlessly right through his (<font color='blue'><b>kid</b></font>) chest. He (<font color='blue'><b>kid</b></font>) looked down. ``What the ...''
I figured I had about three seconds before his (<font color='blue'><b>kid</b></font>) shock turned to anger. ``Run!'' I screamed at
Annabeth and Grover.
We pushed two kids out of the way and raced down the street, not knowing where we were going.
We turned a sharp corner.
``There!'' Annabeth shouted.
Only one store on the block looked open, its windows glaring with neon. The sign above the door
said something like CRSTUY'S WATRE BDE ALPACE.
``Crusty's Water Bed Palace?'' Grover translated.
It didn't sound like a place I'd ever go except in an emergency, but this definitely qualified.
We burst through the doors, ran behind a water bed, and ducked. A split second later, the gang
kids ran past outside.
``I think we lost them,'' Grover panted.
A voice behind us boomed, <div class="bookquote">``Lost who?''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>We all jumped.

<p/>Standing behind us was a guy who looked like a raptor in a leisure suit. He (<font color='blue'><b>guy</b></font>) was at least seven feet
tall, with absolutely no hair. He (<font color='blue'><b>guy</b></font>) had gray, leathery skin, thick-lidded eyes, and a cold, reptilian smile.
He (<font color='blue'><b>guy</b></font>) moved toward us slowly, but I got the feeling he (<font color='blue'><b>guy</b></font>) could move fast if he (<font color='blue'><b>guy</b></font>) needed to.
His (<font color='blue'><b>guy</b></font>) suit might've come from the Lotus Casino. It belonged back in the seventies, big-time. The
shirt was silk paisley, unbuttoned halfway down his (<font color='blue'><b>guy</b></font>) hairless chest. The lapels on his (<font color='blue'><b>guy</b></font>) velvet jacket
were as wide as landing strips. The silver chains around his (<font color='blue'><b>guy</b></font>) neck-I couldn't even count them.
<div class="bookquote">``I'm Crusty,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>guy</b></font>) said, with a tartar-yellow smile.
I resisted the urge to say, Yes, you are.
<div class="bookquote">``Sorry to barge in,''  (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div>I told him (<font color='blue'><b>guy</b></font>). <div class="bookquote">``We were just, um, browsing.''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``You mean hiding from those no-good kids,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>guy</b></font>) grumbled. <div class="bookquote">``They hang around every night. I get a
lot of people in here, thanks to them. Say, you want to look at a water bed?''
 (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div>I was about to say No, thanks, when he (<font color='blue'><b>guy</b></font>) put a huge paw on my shoulder and steered me deeper into
the showroom.
There was every kind of water bed you could imagine: different kinds of wood, different patterns
of sheets; queen-size, king-size, emperor-of-the-universe-size.
<div class="bookquote">``This is my most popular model.''  (<font color='red'><b>Lava</b></font>)</div>Crusty spread his (<font color='blue'><b>guy</b></font>) hands proudly over a bed covered with black
satin sheets, with built-in Lava Lamps on the headboard. The mattress vibrated, so it looked like oilflavored Jell-O.
<div class="bookquote">``Million-hand massage,''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>Crusty told us. ``Go on, try it out. Shoot, take a nap. I don't care. No
business today, any-way.
``Um,'' I said, ``I don't think ...''
``Million-hand massage!'' Grover cried, and dove in. ``Oh, you guys! This is cool.''
``Hmm,'' Crusty said, stroking his (<font color='blue'><b>Grover</b></font>) leathery chin. ``Almost, almost.''
``Almost what?'' I asked.
He (<font color='blue'><b>Grover</b></font>) looked at Annabeth. ``Do me a favor and try this one over here, honey. Might fit.''
Annabeth said, ``But what-``
He (<font color='blue'><b>me</b></font>) patted her (<font color='blue'><b>me</b></font>) reassuringly on the shoulder and led her (<font color='blue'><b>me</b></font>) over to the Safari Deluxe model with
teakwood lions carved into the frame and a leopard-patterned comforter. When Annabeth didn't want
to lie down, Crusty pushed her (<font color='blue'><b>me</b></font>).
``Hey!'' she (<font color='blue'><b>Grover</b></font>) protested.
Crusty snapped his (<font color='blue'><b>Grover</b></font>) fingers. ``Ergo!''
Ropes sprang from the sides of the bed, lashing around Annabeth, holding her (<font color='blue'><b>Grover</b></font>) to the mattress.
Grover tried to get up, but ropes sprang from his (<font color='blue'><b>Grover</b></font>) black-satin bed, too, and lashed him (<font color='blue'><b>Grover</b></font>) down.
``N-not c-c-cool!'' he (<font color='blue'><b>Grover</b></font>) yelled, his (<font color='blue'><b>Grover</b></font>) voice vibrating from the million-hand massage. ``N-not c-cool aat all!''
The giant looked at Annabeth, then turned toward me and grinned. ``Almost, darn it.''
I tried to step away, but his (<font color='blue'><b>Grover</b></font>) hand shot out and clamped around the back of my neck. ``Whoa, kid.
Don't worry. We'll find you one in a sec.''
``Let my friends go.''
``Oh, sure I will. But I got to make them fit, first.''
``What do you mean?''
``All the beds are exactly six feet, see? Your friends are too short. Got to make them fit.''
Annabeth and Grover kept struggling.
``Can't stand imperfect measurements,'' Crusty muttered. <div class="bookquote">``Ergo!''
 (<font color='red'><b>Annabeth/ANNABETH</b></font>)</div>A new set of ropes leaped out from the top and bottom of the beds, wrapping around Grover and

<p/>Annabeth's ankles, then around their armpits. The ropes started tightening, pulling my friends from
both ends.
<div class="bookquote">``Don't worry,''  (<font color='red'><b>me</b></font>)</div>Crusty told me, <div class="bookquote">``These are stretching jobs. Maybe three extra inches on their
spines. They might even live. Now why don't we find a bed you like, huh?''
 (<font color='red'><b>me</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``Percy!''  (<font color='red'><b>Grover/Grover Underwood/GROVER</b></font>)</div>Grover yelled.
My mind was racing. I knew I couldn't take on this giant water-bed salesman alone. He (<font color='blue'><b>Grover</b></font>) would
snap my neck before I ever got my sword out.
<div class="bookquote">``Your real name's not Crusty, is it?''  (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div>I asked.
<div class="bookquote">``Legally, it's Procrustes,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Grover</b></font>) admitted.
<div class="bookquote">``The Stretcher,''  (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div>I said. I remembered the story: the giant who'd tried to kill Theseus with excess
hospitality on his (<font color='blue'><b>Theseus</b></font>) way to Athens.
<div class="bookquote">``Yeah,''  (<font color='red'><b>the salesman</b></font>)</div>the salesman said. <div class="bookquote">``But who can pronounce Procrustes? Bad for business. Now `Crusty,'
anybody can say that.''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``You're right. It's got a good ring to it.''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>His (<font color='blue'><b>salesman</b></font>) eyes lit up. <div class="bookquote">``You think so?''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``Oh, absolutely,''  (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div>I said. <div class="bookquote">``And the workmanship on these beds? Fabulous!''
 (<font color='red'><b>He</b></font>)</div>He (<font color='blue'><b>salesman</b></font>) grinned hugely, but his (<font color='blue'><b>salesman</b></font>) fingers didn't loosen on my neck. <div class="bookquote">``I tell my customers that. Every time.
Nobody bothers to look at the workmanship. How many built-in Lava Lamp headboards have you
seen?''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``Not too many.''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``That's right!''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``Percy!''  (<font color='red'><b>Annabeth/ANNABETH</b></font>)</div>Annabeth yelled. <div class="bookquote">``What are you doing?''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``Don't mind her (<font color='blue'><b>anybody</b></font>),''  (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div>I told Procrustes. <div class="bookquote">``She (<font color='blue'><b>anybody</b></font>)'s impossible.''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>The giant laughed. <div class="bookquote">``All my customers are. Never six feet exactly. So inconsiderate. And then they
complain about the fitting.''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``What do you do if they're longer than six feet?''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``Oh, that happens all the time. It's a simple fix.''
 (<font color='red'><b>He</b></font>)</div>He (<font color='blue'><b>salesman</b></font>) let go of my neck, but before I could react, he (<font color='blue'><b>salesman</b></font>) reached behind a nearby sales desk and brought
out a huge double-bladed brass axe. He (<font color='blue'><b>salesman</b></font>) said, <div class="bookquote">``I just center the subject as best I can and lop off
whatever hangs over on either end.''
 (<font color='red'><b>He</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``Ah,''  (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div>I said, swallowing hard. <div class="bookquote">``Sensible.''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``I'm so glad to come across an intelligent customer!''
 (<font color='red'><b>friends</b></font>)</div>The ropes were really stretching my friends now. Annabeth was turning pale. Grover made
gurgling sounds, like a strangled goose.
<div class="bookquote">``So, Crusty ...''  (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div>I said, trying to keep my voice light. I glanced at the sales tag on the valentineshaped Honeymoon Special. <div class="bookquote">``Does this one really have dynamic stabilizers to stop wave motion?''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``Absolutely. Try it out.''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``Yeah, maybe I will. But would it work even for a big guy like you? No waves at all?''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``Guaranteed.''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``No way.''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``Way.''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``Show me.''
 (<font color='red'><b>He</b></font>)</div>He (<font color='blue'><b>Grover</b></font>) sat down eagerly on the bed, patted the mattress. <div class="bookquote">``No waves. See?''
 (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div>I snapped my fingers. <div class="bookquote">``Ergo.''
 (<font color='red'><b>him</b></font>)</div>Ropes lashed around Crusty and flattened him (<font color='blue'><b>Grover</b></font>) against the mattress.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Hey!''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Grover</b></font>) yelled.
<div class="bookquote">``Center him (<font color='blue'><b>guy</b></font>) just right,''  (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div>I said.
The ropes readjusted themselves at my command. Crusty's whole head stuck out the top. His (<font color='blue'><b>Grover</b></font>) feet
stuck out the bottom.
<div class="bookquote">``No!''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Grover</b></font>) said. <div class="bookquote">``Wait! This is just a demo.''
 (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div>I uncapped Riptide. <div class="bookquote">``A few simple adjustments ...''
 (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div>I had no qualms about what I was about to do. If Crusty were human, I couldn't hurt him (<font color='blue'><b>Grover</b></font>) anyway.
If he (<font color='blue'><b>Grover</b></font>) was a monster, he (<font color='blue'><b>Grover</b></font>) deserved to turn into dust for a while.
<div class="bookquote">``You drive a hard bargain,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Grover</b></font>) told me. ``I'll give you thirty percent off on selected floor
models.'''
``I think I'll start with the top.'' I raised my sword.
``No money down! No interest for six months!''
I swung the sword. Crusty stopped making offers.
I cut the ropes on the other beds. Annabeth and Grover got to their feet, groaning and wincing and
cursing me a lot.
``You look taller,'' I said.
``Very funny,'' Annabeth said. ``Be faster next time.''
I looked at the bulletin board behind Crusty's sales desk. There was an advertisement for Hermes
Delivery Service, and another for the All-New Compendium of L.A. Area Monsters-``The only
Monstrous Yellow Pages you'll ever need!'' Under that, a bright orange flier for DOA Recording
Studios, offering commissions for heroes' souls. ``We are always looking for new talent!'' DOA's
address was right underneath with a map.
``Come on,'' I told my friends.
``Give us a minute,'' Grover complained. ``We were almost stretched to death.'''
<div class="bookquote">``Then you're ready for the Underworld,''  (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div>I said. <div class="bookquote">``It's only a block from here.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Percy/Percy Jackson/Jackson</b></font>)</div><p/>Percy Jackson 1 - The Lightning Thief
18 ANNABETH DOES
OBEDIENCE SCHOOL
We stood in the shadows of Valencia Boulevard, looking up at gold letters etched in black
marble: DOA RECORDING STUDIOS.
Underneath, stenciled on the glass doors: NO SOLICITORS. NO LOITERING. NO LIVING.
It was almost midnight, but the lobby was brightly lit and full of people. Behind the security desk
sat a tough-looking guard with sunglasses and an earpiece.
I turned to my friends. <div class="bookquote">``Okay. You remember the plan.''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``The plan,''  (<font color='red'><b>Grover/Grover Underwood/GROVER</b></font>)</div>Grover gulped. <div class="bookquote">``Yeah. I love the plan.''
 (<font color='red'><b>Annabeth/ANNABETH</b></font>)</div>Annabeth said, <div class="bookquote">``What happens if the plan doesn't work?''
 (<font color='red'><b>Annabeth/ANNABETH</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``Don't think negative.''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``Right,''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Lightning</b></font>) said. <div class="bookquote">``We're entering the Land of the Dead, and I shouldn't think negative.''
 (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div>I took the pearls out of my pocket, the three milky spheres the Nereid had given me in Santa
Monica. They didn't seem like much of a backup in case something went wrong.
Annabeth put her (<font color='blue'><b>Monica</b></font>) hand on my shoulder. <div class="bookquote">``I'm sorry, Percy. You're right, we'll make it. It'll be
fine.''
 (<font color='red'><b>She</b></font>)</div>She (<font color='blue'><b>Monica</b></font>) gave Grover a nudge.
<div class="bookquote">``Oh, right!''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Grover</b></font>) chimed in. <div class="bookquote">``We got this far. We'll find the master bolt and save your mom. No
problem.''
 (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div>I looked at them both, and felt really grateful. Only a few minutes before, I'd almost gotten them
stretched to death on deluxe water beds, and now they were trying to be brave for my sake, trying to
make me feel better.
I slipped the pearls back in my pocket. <div class="bookquote">``Let's whup some Underworld butt.''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>We walked inside the DOA lobby.
Muzak played softly on hidden speakers. The carpet and walls were steel gray. Pencil cactuses
grew in the corners like skeleton hands. The furniture was black leather, and every seat was taken.
There were people sitting on couches, people standing up, people staring out the windows or waiting
for the elevator. Nobody moved, or talked, or did much of anything. Out of the corner of my eye, I
could see them all just fine, but if I focused on any one of them in particular, they started looking ...
transparent. I could see right through their bodies.
The security guard's desk was a raised podium, so we had to look up at him (<font color='blue'><b>guard</b></font>).
He (<font color='blue'><b>guard</b></font>) was tall and elegant, with chocolate-colored skin and bleached-blond hair shaved military
style. He (<font color='blue'><b>guard</b></font>) wore tortoiseshell shades and a silk Italian suit that matched his (<font color='blue'><b>guard</b></font>) hair. A black rose was
pinned to his (<font color='blue'><b>guard</b></font>) lapel under a silver name tag.
I read the name tag, then looked at him (<font color='blue'><b>guard</b></font>) in bewilderment. <div class="bookquote">``Your name is Chiron?''
 (<font color='red'><b>He</b></font>)</div>He (<font color='blue'><b>guard</b></font>) leaned across the desk. I couldn't see anything in his (<font color='blue'><b>guard</b></font>) glasses except my own reflection, but his (<font color='blue'><b>guard</b></font>)
smile was sweet and cold, like a pythons, right before it eats you.
<div class="bookquote">``What a precious young lad.''  (<font color='red'><b>He</b></font>)</div>He (<font color='blue'><b>guard</b></font>) had a strange accent-British, maybe, but also as if he (<font color='blue'><b>guard</b></font>) had
learned English as a second language. <div class="bookquote">``Tell me, mate, do I look like a centaur?''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``N-no.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Sir,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>guard</b></font>) added smoothly.
<div class="bookquote">``Sir,''  (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div>I said.
He (<font color='blue'><b>guard</b></font>) pinched the name tag and ran his (<font color='blue'><b>guard</b></font>) finger under the letters. <div class="bookquote">``Can you read this, mate? It says CH-A-R-O-N. Say it with me: CARE-ON.''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``Charon.''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``Amazing! Now: Mr. Charon.''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``Mr. Charon,''  (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div>I said.
<div class="bookquote">``Well done.''  (<font color='red'><b>He</b></font>)</div>He (<font color='blue'><b>guard</b></font>) sat back. <div class="bookquote">``I hate being confused with that old horse-man. And now, how may I
help you little dead ones?''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>His (<font color='blue'><b>guard</b></font>) question caught in my stomach like a fastball. I looked at Annabeth for support.
<div class="bookquote">``We want to go the Underworld,''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>guard</b></font>) said.
Charon's mouth twitched. <div class="bookquote">``Well, that's refreshing.''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``It is?''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>guard</b></font>) asked.
``Straightforward and honest. No screaming. No `There must be a mistake, Mr. Charon.''' He (<font color='blue'><b>Charon</b></font>)
looked us over. ``How did you die, then?''
I nudged Grover.
``Oh,'' he (<font color='blue'><b>Grover</b></font>) said. ``Um ... drowned ... in the bathtub.''
``All three of you?'' Charon asked. We nodded.
``Big bathtub.'' Charon looked mildly impressed. ``I don't suppose you have coins for passage.
Normally, with adults, you see, I could charge your American Express, or add the ferry price to your
last cable bill. But with children ... alas, you never die prepared. Suppose you'll have to take a seat
for a few centuries.''
``Oh, but we have coins.'' I set three golden drachmas on the counter, part of the stash I'd found in
Crusty's office desk.
``Well, now ...'' Charon moistened his (<font color='blue'><b>Charon</b></font>) lips. ``Real drachmas. Real golden drachmas. I haven't
seen these in ...''
His (<font color='blue'><b>Charon</b></font>) fingers hovered greedily over the coins.
We were so close.
Then Charon looked at me. That cold stare behind his (<font color='blue'><b>Charon</b></font>) glasses seemed to bore a hole through my
chest. ``Here now,'' he (<font color='blue'><b>Charon</b></font>) said. ``You couldn't read my name correctly. Are you dyslexic, lad?''
``No,'' I said. ``I'm dead.''
Charon leaned forward and took a sniff. ``You're not dead. I should've known. You're a godling.''
``We have to get to the Underworld,'' I insisted.
Charon made a growling sound deep in his (<font color='blue'><b>Charon</b></font>) throat.
Immediately, all the people in the waiting room got up and started pacing, agitated, lighting
cigarettes, running hands through their hair, or checking their wristwatches.
``Leave while you can,'' Charon told us. ``I'll just take these and forget I saw you.''
He (<font color='blue'><b>Charon</b></font>) started to go for the coins, but I snatched them back.
``No service, no tip.'' I tried to sound braver than I felt.
Charon growled again-a deep, blood-chilling sound. The spirits of the dead started pounding on
the elevator doors.
``It's a shame, too,'' I sighed. ``We had more to offer.''
I held up the entire bag from Crusty's stash. I took out a fistful of drachmas and let the coins spill
through my fingers.
Charon's growl changed into something more like a lion's purr. ``Do you think I can be bought,

<p/>godling? Eh ... just out of curiosity, how much have you got there?''
``A lot,'' I said. ``I bet Hades doesn't pay you well enough for such hard work.''
``Oh, you don't know the half of it. How would you like to babysit these spirits all day? Always
`Please don't let me be dead' or `Please let me across for free.' I haven't had a pay raise in three
thousand years. Do you imagine suits like this come cheap?''
``You deserve better,'' I agreed. ``A little appreciation. Respect. Good pay.''
With each word, I stacked another gold coin on the counter.
Charon glanced down at his (<font color='blue'><b>Charon</b></font>) silk Italian jacket, as if imagining himself in something even better. ``I
must say, lad, you're making some sense now. Just a little.''
I stacked another few coins. ``I could mention a pay raise while I'm talking to Hades.''
He (<font color='blue'><b>Charon</b></font>) sighed. ``The boat's almost full, anyway. I might as well add you three and be off.''
He (<font color='blue'><b>Charon</b></font>) stood, scooped up our money, and said, ``Come along.''
We pushed through the crowd of waiting spirits, who started grabbing at our clothes like the
wind, their voices whispering things I couldn't make out. Charon shoved them out of the way,
grumbling, ``Freeloaders.''
He (<font color='blue'><b>Charon</b></font>) escorted us into the elevator, which was already crowded with souls of the dead, each one
holding a green boarding pass. Charon grabbed two spirits who were trying to get on with us and
pushed them back into the lobby.
``Right. Now, no one get any ideas while I'm gone,'' he (<font color='blue'><b>Charon</b></font>) announced to the waiting room. ``And if
anyone moves the dial off my easy-listening station again, I'll make sure you're here for another
thousand years. Understand?''
He (<font color='blue'><b>Charon</b></font>) shut the doors. He (<font color='blue'><b>Charon</b></font>) put a key card into a slot in the elevator panel and we started to descend.
``What happens to the spirits waiting in the lobby?'' Annabeth asked.
``Nothing,'' Charon said.
``For how long?''
``Forever, or until I'm feeling generous.''
``Oh,'' she (<font color='blue'><b>Charon</b></font>) said. ``That's ... fair.''
Charon raised an eyebrow. ``Whoever said death was fair, young miss? Wait until it's your turn.
You'll die soon enough, where you're going.''
``We'll get out alive,'' I said.
``Ha.''
I got a sudden dizzy feeling. We weren't going down anymore, but forward. The air turned misty.
Spirits around me started changing shape. Their modern clothes flickered, turning into gray hooded
robes. The floor of the elevator began swaying.
I blinked hard. When I opened my eyes, Charon's creamy Italian suit had been replaced by a long
black robe. His (<font color='blue'><b>Charon</b></font>) tortoiseshell glasses were gone. Where his (<font color='blue'><b>Charon</b></font>) eyes should've been were empty socketslike Ares's eyes, except Charon's were totally dark, full of night and death and despair.
He (<font color='blue'><b>Charon</b></font>) saw me looking, and said, ``Well?''
``Nothing,'' I managed.
I thought he (<font color='blue'><b>Charon</b></font>) was grinning, but that wasn't it. The flesh of his (<font color='blue'><b>Charon</b></font>) face was becoming transparent,
letting me see straight through to his (<font color='blue'><b>Charon</b></font>) skull.
The floor kept swaying.
Grover said, <div class="bookquote">``I think I'm getting seasick.''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>When I blinked again, the elevator wasn't an elevator anymore. We were standing in a wooden
barge. Charon was poling us across a dark, oily river, swirling with bones, dead fish, and other,

<p/>stranger things-plastic dolls, crushed carnations, soggy diplomas with gilt edges.
<div class="bookquote">``The River Styx,''  (<font color='red'><b>Annabeth/ANNABETH</b></font>)</div>Annabeth murmured. <div class="bookquote">``It's so ...''
 (<font color='red'><b>Charon/Mr. Charon</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``Polluted,''  (<font color='red'><b>Charon/Mr. Charon</b></font>)</div>Charon said. <div class="bookquote">``For thousands of years, you humans have been throwing in everything
as you come across-hopes, dreams, wishes that never came true. Irresponsible waste management, if
you ask me.''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>Mist curled off the filthy water. Above us, almost lost in the gloom, was a ceiling of stalactites.
Ahead, the far shore glimmered with greenish light, the color of poison.
Panic closed up my throat. What was I doing here? These people around me ... they were dead.
Annabeth grabbed hold of my hand. Under normal circumstances, this would've embarrassed me,
but I understood how she (<font color='blue'><b>Annabeth</b></font>) felt. She (<font color='blue'><b>Annabeth</b></font>) wanted reassurance that somebody else was alive on this boat.
I found myself muttering a prayer, though I wasn't quite sure who I was praying to. Down here,
only one god mattered, and he (<font color='blue'><b>god</b></font>) was the one I had come to confront.
The shoreline of the Underworld came into view. Craggy rocks and black volcanic sand stretched
inland about a hundred yards to the base of a high stone wall, which marched off in either direction as
far as we could see. A sound came from somewhere nearby in the green gloom, echoing off the
stones-the howl of a large animal.
<div class="bookquote">``Old Three-Face is hungry,''  (<font color='red'><b>Charon/Mr. Charon</b></font>)</div>Charon said. His (<font color='blue'><b>Charon</b></font>) smile turned skeletal in the greenish light. <div class="bookquote">``Bad
luck for you, godlings.''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>The bottom of our boat slid onto the black sand. The dead began to disembark. A woman holding
a little girl's hand. An old man and an old woman hobbling along arm in arm. A boy no older than I
was, shuffling silently along in his (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>) gray robe.
Charon said, <div class="bookquote">``I'd wish you luck, mate, but there isn't any down here. Mind you, don't forget to
mention my pay raise.''
 (<font color='red'><b>Charon/Mr. Charon</b></font>)</div>He (<font color='blue'><b>Charon</b></font>) counted our golden coins into his (<font color='blue'><b>Charon</b></font>) pouch, then took up his (<font color='blue'><b>Charon</b></font>) pole. He (<font color='blue'><b>Charon</b></font>) warbled something that
sounded like a Barry Manilow song as he (<font color='blue'><b>Barry</b></font>) ferried the empty barge back across the river.
We followed the spirits up a well-worn path.
I'm not sure what I was expecting-Pearly Gates, or a big black portcullis, or something. But the
entrance to the Underworld looked like a cross between airport security and the Jersey Turnpike.
There were three separate entrances under one huge black archway that said YOU ARE NOW
ENTERING EREBUS. Each entrance had a pass-through metal detector with security cameras
mounted on top. Beyond this were tollbooths manned by black-robed ghouls like Charon.
The howling of the hungry animal was really loud now, but I couldn't see where it was coming
from. The three-headed dog, Cerberus, who was supposed to guard Hades's door, was nowhere to be
seen.
The dead queued up in the three lines, two marked ATTENDANT ON DUTY, and one marked EZ
DEATH. The EZ DEATH line was moving right along. The other two were crawling.
<div class="bookquote">``What do you figure?''  (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div>I asked Annabeth.
<div class="bookquote">``The fast line must go straight to the Asphodel Fields,''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>ghouls</b></font>) said. <div class="bookquote">``No contest. They don't want to
risk judgment from the court, because it might go against them.''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``There's a court for dead people?''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``Yeah. Three judges. They switch around who sits on the bench. King Minos, Thomas Jefferson,
Shakespeare-people like that. Sometimes they look at a life and decide that person needs a special
reward-the Fields of Elysium. Sometimes they decide on punishment. But most people, well, they just
lived. Nothing special, good or bad. So they go to the Asphodel Fields.''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``And do what?''

 (<font color='red'><b>Grover/Grover Underwood/GROVER</b></font>)</div><p/>Grover said, <div class="bookquote">``Imagine standing in a wheat field in Kansas. Forever.''
 (<font color='red'><b>Grover/Grover Underwood/GROVER</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``Harsh,''  (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div>I said.
<div class="bookquote">``Not as harsh as that,''  (<font color='red'><b>Grover/Grover Underwood/GROVER</b></font>)</div>Grover muttered. <div class="bookquote">``Look.''
 (<font color='red'><b>A couple</b></font>)</div>A couple of black-robbed ghouls had pulled aside one spirit and were frisking him (<font color='blue'><b>Grover</b></font>) at the security
desk. The face of the dead man looked vaguely familiar.
<div class="bookquote">``He (<font color='blue'><b>Jefferson</b></font>)'s that preacher who made the news, remember?''  (<font color='red'><b>Grover/Grover Underwood/GROVER</b></font>)</div>Grover asked.
<div class="bookquote">``Oh, yeah.''  (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div>I did remember now. We'd seen him (<font color='blue'><b>Grover</b></font>) on TV a couple of times at the Yancy Academy
dorm. He (<font color='blue'><b>Academy</b></font>) was this annoying televangelist from upstate New York who'd raised millions of dollars
for orphanages and then got caught spending the money on stuff for his (<font color='blue'><b>Academy</b></font>) mansion, like gold-plated toilet
seats, and an indoor putt-putt golf course. He (<font color='blue'><b>Academy</b></font>)'d died in a police chase when his (<font color='blue'><b>Academy</b></font>) <div class="bookquote">``Lamborghini for the
Lord''  (<font color='red'><b>police</b></font>)</div>went off a cliff.
I said, <div class="bookquote">``What're they doing to him (<font color='blue'><b>Lord</b></font>)?''
 (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``Special punishment from Hades,''  (<font color='red'><b>Grover/Grover Underwood/GROVER</b></font>)</div>Grover guessed. <div class="bookquote">``The really bad people get his (<font color='blue'><b>Lord</b></font>) personal
attention as soon as they arrive. The Fur-the Kindly Ones will set up an eternal torture for him (<font color='blue'><b>Lord</b></font>).''
 (<font color='red'><b>the Furies</b></font>)</div>The thought of the Furies made me shudder. I realized I was in their home territory now. Old Mrs.
Dodds would be licking her (<font color='blue'><b>Dodds</b></font>) lips with anticipation.
<div class="bookquote">``But if he (<font color='blue'><b>Lord</b></font>)'s a preacher,''  (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div>I said, <div class="bookquote">``and he (<font color='blue'><b>Lord</b></font>) believes in a different hell... .''
 (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div>Grover shrugged. <div class="bookquote">``Who says he (<font color='blue'><b>Lord</b></font>)'s seeing this place the way we're seeing it? Humans see what
they want to see. You're very stubborn-er, persistent, that way.''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>We got closer to the gates. The howling was so loud now it shook the ground at my feet, but I still
couldn't figure out where it was coming from.
Then, about fifty feet in front of us, the green mist shimmered. Standing just where the path split
into three lanes was an enormous shadowy monster.
I hadn't seen it before because it was half transparent, like the dead. Until it moved, it blended
with whatever was behind it. Only its eyes and teeth looked solid. And it was staring straight at me.
My jaw hung open. All I could think to say was, <div class="bookquote">``He (<font color='blue'><b>Lord</b></font>)'s a Rottweiler.''
 (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div>I'd always imagined Cerberus as a big black mastiff. But he (<font color='blue'><b>mastiff</b></font>) was obviously a purebred
Rottweiler, except of course that he (<font color='blue'><b>Rottweiler</b></font>) was twice the size of a woolly mammoth, mostly invisible, and
had three heads.
The dead walked right up to him-no fear at all. The ATTENDANT ON DUTY lines parted on
either side of him (<font color='blue'><b>Rottweiler</b></font>). The EZ DEATH spirits walked right between his (<font color='blue'><b>Rottweiler</b></font>) front paws and under his (<font color='blue'><b>Rottweiler</b></font>) belly,
which they could do without even crouching.
<div class="bookquote">``I'm starting to see him (<font color='blue'><b>Lord</b></font>) better,''  (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div>I muttered. <div class="bookquote">``Why is that?''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``I think ...''  (<font color='red'><b>Annabeth/ANNABETH</b></font>)</div>Annabeth moistened her (<font color='blue'><b>mastiff</b></font>) lips. <div class="bookquote">``I'm afraid it's because we're getting closer to being
dead.''
 (<font color='red'><b>The dog</b></font>)</div>The dog's middle head craned toward us. It sniffed the air and growled.
<div class="bookquote">``It can smell the living,''  (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div>I said.
<div class="bookquote">``But that's okay,''  (<font color='red'><b>Grover/Grover Underwood/GROVER</b></font>)</div>Grover said, trembling next to me. <div class="bookquote">``Because we have a plan.''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``Right,''  (<font color='red'><b>Annabeth/ANNABETH</b></font>)</div>Annabeth said. I'd never heard her (<font color='blue'><b>mastiff</b></font>) voice sound quite so small. <div class="bookquote">``A plan.''
 (<font color='red'><b>the monster</b></font>)</div>We moved toward the monster.
The middle head snarled at us, then barked so loud my eyeballs rattled.
<div class="bookquote">``Can you understand it?''  (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div>I asked Grover.
<div class="bookquote">``Oh yeah,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Grover</b></font>) said. <div class="bookquote">``I can understand it.''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``What's it saying?''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``I don't think humans have a four-letter word that translates, exactly.''

 (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div><p/>I took the big stick out of my backpack-a bedpost I'd broken off Crusty's Safari Deluxe floor
model. I held it up, and tried to channel happy dog thoughts toward Cerberus-Alpo commercials, cute
little puppies, fire hydrants. I tried to smile, like I wasn't about to die.
<div class="bookquote">``Hey, Big Fella,''  (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div>I called up. <div class="bookquote">``I bet they don't play with you much.''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``GROWWWLLLL!''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``Good boy,''  (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div>I said weakly.
I waved the stick. The dog's middle head followed the movement. The other two heads trained
their eyes on me, completely ignoring the spirits. I had Cerberus's undivided attention. I wasn't sure
that was a good thing.
<div class="bookquote">``Fetch!''  (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div>I threw the stick into the gloom, a good solid throw. I heard it go ker-sploosh in the
River Styx.
Cerberus glared at me, unimpressed. His (<font color='blue'><b>spirits</b></font>) eyes were baleful and cold.
So much for the plan.
Cerberus was now making a new kind of growl, deeper down in his (<font color='blue'><b>spirits</b></font>) three throats.
<div class="bookquote">``Um,''  (<font color='red'><b>Grover/Grover Underwood/GROVER</b></font>)</div>Grover said. <div class="bookquote">``Percy?''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``Yeah?''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``I just thought you'd want to know.''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``Yeah?''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``Cerberus? He (<font color='blue'><b>Percy</b></font>)'s saying we've got ten seconds to pray to the god of our choice. After that... well
... he (<font color='blue'><b>Percy</b></font>)'s hungry.''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``Wait!''  (<font color='red'><b>Annabeth/ANNABETH</b></font>)</div>Annabeth said. She (<font color='blue'><b>me</b></font>) started rifling through her (<font color='blue'><b>me</b></font>) pack.
Uh-oh, I thought.
<div class="bookquote">``Five seconds,''  (<font color='red'><b>Grover/Grover Underwood/GROVER</b></font>)</div>Grover said. <div class="bookquote">``Do we run now?''
 (<font color='red'><b>Annabeth/ANNABETH</b></font>)</div>Annabeth produced a red rubber ball the size of a grapefruit. It was labeled WATERLAND,
DENVER, CO.. Before I could stop her (<font color='blue'><b>me</b></font>), she (<font color='blue'><b>me</b></font>) raised the ball and marched straight up to Cerberus.
She (<font color='blue'><b>me</b></font>) shouted, <div class="bookquote">``See the ball? You want the ball, Cerberus? Sit!''
 (<font color='red'><b>She</b></font>)</div>Cerberus looked as stunned as we were.
All three of his (<font color='blue'><b>Grover</b></font>) heads cocked sideways. Six nostrils dilated.
<div class="bookquote">``Sit!''  (<font color='red'><b>Annabeth/ANNABETH</b></font>)</div>Annabeth called again.
I was sure that any moment she (<font color='blue'><b>me</b></font>) would become the world's largest Milkbone dog biscuit.
But instead, Cerberus licked his (<font color='blue'><b>Grover</b></font>) three sets of lips, shifted on his (<font color='blue'><b>Grover</b></font>) haunches, and sat, immediately
crushing a dozen spirits who'd been passing underneath him (<font color='blue'><b>Grover</b></font>) in the EZ DEATH line. The spirits made
muffled hisses as they dissipated, like the air let out of tires.
Annabeth said, <div class="bookquote">``Good boy!''
 (<font color='red'><b>Annabeth/ANNABETH</b></font>)</div>She (<font color='blue'><b>me</b></font>) threw Cerberus the ball.
He (<font color='blue'><b>Grover</b></font>) caught it in his (<font color='blue'><b>Grover</b></font>) middle mouth. It was barely big enough for him (<font color='blue'><b>Grover</b></font>) to chew, and the other heads
started snapping at the middle, trying to get the new toy.
``Drop it.''' Annabeth ordered.
Cerberus's heads stopped fighting and looked at her (<font color='blue'><b>Cerberus</b></font>). The ball was wedged between two of his (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>)
teeth like a tiny piece of gum. He (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>) made a loud, scary whimper, then dropped the ball, now slimy and
bitten nearly in half, at Annabeth's feet.
``Good boy.'' She (<font color='blue'><b>me</b></font>) picked up the ball, ignoring the monster spit all over it.
She (<font color='blue'><b>me</b></font>) turned toward us. ``Go now. EZ DEATH line-it's faster.''
I said, ``But-``
``Now.''' She (<font color='blue'><b>Cerberus</b></font>) ordered, in the same tone she (<font color='blue'><b>Cerberus</b></font>) was using on the dog.

<p/>Grover and I inched forward warily.
Cerberus started to growl.
<div class="bookquote">``Stay!''  (<font color='red'><b>Annabeth/ANNABETH</b></font>)</div>Annabeth ordered the monster. <div class="bookquote">``If you want the ball, stay!''
 (<font color='red'><b>Cerberus</b></font>)</div>Cerberus whimpered, but he (<font color='blue'><b>Grover</b></font>) stayed where he (<font color='blue'><b>Grover</b></font>) was.
<div class="bookquote">``What about you?''  (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div>I asked Annabeth as we passed her (<font color='blue'><b>me</b></font>).
<div class="bookquote">``I know what I'm doing, Percy,''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>me</b></font>) muttered. <div class="bookquote">``At least, I'm pretty sure... .''
 (<font color='red'><b>Grover/Grover Underwood/GROVER</b></font>)</div>Grover and I walked between the monster's legs.
Please, Annabeth, I prayed. Don't tell him (<font color='blue'><b>Grover</b></font>) to sit again.
We made it through. Cerberus wasn't any less scary-looking from the back.
Annabeth said, <div class="bookquote">``Good dog!''
 (<font color='red'><b>Annabeth/ANNABETH</b></font>)</div>She (<font color='blue'><b>me</b></font>) held up the tattered red ball, and probably came to the same conclusion I did-if she (<font color='blue'><b>me</b></font>) rewarded
Cerberus, there'd be nothing left for another trick.
She (<font color='blue'><b>me</b></font>) threw the ball anyway. The monster's left mouth immediately snatched it up, only to be
attacked by the middle head, while the right head moaned in protest.
While the monster was distracted, Annabeth walked briskly under its belly and joined us at the
metal detector.
<div class="bookquote">``How did you do that?''  (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div>I asked her (<font color='blue'><b>me</b></font>), amazed.
<div class="bookquote">``Obedience school,''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>me</b></font>) said breathlessly, and I was surprised to see there were tears in her (<font color='blue'><b>me</b></font>)
eyes. <div class="bookquote">``When I was little, at my dad's house, we had a Doberman... .''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``Never mind that,''  (<font color='red'><b>Grover/Grover Underwood/GROVER</b></font>)</div>Grover said, tugging at my shirt. <div class="bookquote">``Come on!''
 (<font color='red'><b>Cerberus</b></font>)</div>We were about to bolt through the EZ DEATH line when Cerberus moaned pitifully from all three
mouths. Annabeth stopped.
She (<font color='blue'><b>me</b></font>) turned to face the dog, which had done a one-eighty to look at us.
Cerberus panted expectantly, the tiny red ball in pieces in a puddle of drool at its feet.
<div class="bookquote">``Good boy,''  (<font color='red'><b>Annabeth/ANNABETH</b></font>)</div>Annabeth said, but her (<font color='blue'><b>me</b></font>) voice sounded melancholy and uncertain.
The monster's heads turned sideways, as if worried about her (<font color='blue'><b>me</b></font>).
<div class="bookquote">``I'll bring you another ball soon,''  (<font color='red'><b>Annabeth/ANNABETH</b></font>)</div>Annabeth promised faintly. <div class="bookquote">``Would you like that?''
 (<font color='red'><b>The monster</b></font>)</div>The monster whimpered. I didn't need to speak dog to know Cerberus was still waiting for the
ball.
<div class="bookquote">``Good dog. I'll come visit you soon. I-I promise.''  (<font color='red'><b>Annabeth/ANNABETH</b></font>)</div>Annabeth turned to us. <div class="bookquote">``Let's go.''
 (<font color='red'><b>Grover/Grover Underwood/GROVER</b></font>)</div>Grover and I pushed through the metal detector, which immediately screamed and set off flashing
red lights. <div class="bookquote">``Unauthorized possessions! Magic detected!''
 (<font color='red'><b>Cerberus</b></font>)</div>Cerberus started to bark.
We burst through the EZ DEATH gate, which started even more alarms blaring, and raced into the
Underworld.
A few minutes later, we were hiding, out of breath, in the rotten trunk of an immense black tree as
security ghouls scuttled past, yelling for backup from the Furies.
Grover murmured, <div class="bookquote">``Well, Percy, what have we learned today?''
 (<font color='red'><b>Grover/Grover Underwood/GROVER</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``That three-headed dogs prefer red rubber balls over sticks?''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``No,''  (<font color='red'><b>Grover/Grover Underwood/GROVER</b></font>)</div>Grover told me. <div class="bookquote">``We've learned that your plans really, really bite!''
 (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div>I wasn't sure about that. I thought maybe Annabeth and I had both had the right idea. Even here in
the Underworld, everybody-even monsters-needed a little attention once in a while.
I thought about that as we waited for the ghouls to pass. I pretended not to see Annabeth wipe a
tear from her (<font color='blue'><b>I</b></font>) cheek as she (<font color='blue'><b>I</b></font>) listened to the mournful keening of Cerberus in the distance, longing for his (<font color='blue'><b>Grover</b></font>)
new friend.

<p/>Percy Jackson 1 - The Lightning Thief
19 WE FIND OUT THE TRUTH,
SORT OF
Imagine the largest concert crowd you've ever seen, a football field packed with a million fans.
Now imagine a field a million times that big, packed with people, and imagine the electricity has
gone out, and there is no noise, no light, no beach ball bouncing around over the crowd. Something
tragic has happened backstage. Whispering masses of people are just milling around in the shadows,
waiting for a concert that will never start.
If you can picture that, you have a pretty good idea what the Fields of Asphodel looked like. The
black grass had been trampled by eons of dead feet. A warm, moist wind blew like the breath of a
swamp. Black trees-Grover told me they were poplars-grew in clumps here and there.
The cavern ceiling was so high above us it might've been a bank of storm clouds, except for the
stalactites, which glowed faint gray and looked wickedly pointed. I tried not to imagine they'd fall on
us at any moment, but dotted around the fields were several that had fallen and impaled themselves in
the black grass. I guess the dead didn't have to worry about little hazards like being speared by
stalactites the size of booster rockets.
Annabeth, Grover, and I tried to blend into the crowd, keeping an eye out for security ghouls. I
couldn't help looking for familiar faces among the spirits of Asphodel, but the dead are hard to look
at. Their faces shimmer. They all look slightly angry or confused. They will come up to you and
speak, but their voices sound like chatter, like bats twittering. Once they realize you can't understand
them, they frown and move away.
The dead aren't scary. They're just sad.
We crept along, following the line of new arrivals that snaked from the main gates toward a
black-tented pavilion with a banner that read:
JUDGMENTS FOR ELYSIUM AND ETERNAL DAMNATION
Welcome, Newly Deceased!
Out the back of the tent came two much smaller lines.
To the left, spirits flanked by security ghouls were marched down a rocky path toward the Fields
of Punishment, which glowed and smoked in the distance, a vast, cracked wasteland with rivers of
lava and minefields and miles of barbed wire separating the different torture areas. Even from far
away, I could see people being chased by hellhounds, burned at the stake, forced to run naked through
cactus patches or listen to opera music. I could just make out a tiny hill, with the ant-size figure of
Sisyphus struggling to move his (<font color='blue'><b>Sisyphus</b></font>) boulder to the top. And I saw worse tortures, too-things I don't want
to describe.
The line coming from the right side of the judgment pavilion was much better. This one led down
toward a small valley surrounded by walls-a gated community, which seemed to be the only happy
part of the Underworld. Beyond the security gate were neighborhoods of beautiful houses from every
time period in history, Roman villas and medieval castles and Victorian mansions. Silver and gold
flowers bloomed on the lawns. The grass rippled in rainbow colors. I could hear laughter and smell
barbecue cooking.
Elysium.

<p/>In the middle of that valley was a glittering blue lake, with three small islands like a vacation
resort in the Bahamas. The Isles of the Blest, for people who had chosen to be reborn three times, and
three times achieved Elysium. Immediately I knew that's where I wanted to go when I died.
<div class="bookquote">``That's what it's all about,''  (<font color='red'><b>Annabeth/ANNABETH</b></font>)</div>Annabeth said, like she (<font color='blue'><b>I</b></font>) was reading my thoughts. <div class="bookquote">``That's the place
for heroes.''
 (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div>But I thought of how few people there were in Elysium, how tiny it was compared to the Fields of
Asphodel or even the Fields of Punishment. So few people did good in their lives. It was depressing.
We left the judgment pavilion and moved deeper into the Asphodel Fields. It got darker. The
colors faded from our clothes. The crowds of chattering spirits began to thin.
After a few miles of walking, we began to hear a familiar screech in the distance. Looming on the
horizon was a palace of glittering black obsidian. Above the parapets swirled three dark batlike
creatures: the Furies. I got the feeling they were waiting for us.
<div class="bookquote">``I suppose it's too late to turn back,''  (<font color='red'><b>Grover/Grover Underwood/GROVER</b></font>)</div>Grover said wistfully.
<div class="bookquote">``We'll be okay.''  (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div>I tried to sound confident.
<div class="bookquote">``Maybe we should search some of the other places first,''  (<font color='red'><b>Grover/Grover Underwood/GROVER</b></font>)</div>Grover suggested. <div class="bookquote">``Like, Elysium, for
instance ...''
 (<font color='red'><b>Annabeth/ANNABETH</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``Come on, goat boy.''  (<font color='red'><b>Annabeth/ANNABETH</b></font>)</div>Annabeth grabbed his (<font color='blue'><b>Grover</b></font>) arm.
Grover yelped. His (<font color='blue'><b>Grover</b></font>) sneakers sprouted wings and his (<font color='blue'><b>Grover</b></font>) legs shot forward, pulling him (<font color='blue'><b>Grover</b></font>) away from
Annabeth. He (<font color='blue'><b>Grover</b></font>) landed flat on his (<font color='blue'><b>Grover</b></font>) back in the grass.
<div class="bookquote">``Grover,''  (<font color='red'><b>Annabeth/ANNABETH</b></font>)</div>Annabeth chided. <div class="bookquote">``Stop messing around.''
 (<font color='red'><b>He</b></font>)</div>``But I didn't-``
He (<font color='blue'><b>Grover</b></font>) yelped again. His (<font color='blue'><b>Grover</b></font>) shoes were flapping like crazy now. They levitated off the ground and
started dragging him (<font color='blue'><b>Grover</b></font>) away from us.
<div class="bookquote">``Maia!''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Grover</b></font>) yelled, but the magic word seemed to have no effect. <div class="bookquote">``Maia, already! Nine-one-one!
Help!''
 (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div>I got over being stunned and made a grab for Grover's hand, but too late. He (<font color='blue'><b>Grover</b></font>) was picking up
speed, skidding downhill like a bobsled.
We ran after him (<font color='blue'><b>Grover</b></font>).
Annabeth shouted, <div class="bookquote">``Untie the shoes!''
 (<font color='red'><b>Annabeth/ANNABETH</b></font>)</div>It was a smart idea, but I guess it's not so easy when your shoes are pulling you along feetfirst at
full speed. Grover tried to sit up, but he (<font color='blue'><b>Grover</b></font>) couldn't get close to the laces.
We kept after him (<font color='blue'><b>Grover</b></font>), trying to keep him (<font color='blue'><b>Grover</b></font>) in sight as he (<font color='blue'><b>Grover</b></font>) ripped between the legs of spirits who
chattered at him (<font color='blue'><b>Grover</b></font>) in annoyance.
I was sure Grover was going to barrel straight through the gates of Hades's palace, but his (<font color='blue'><b>Grover</b></font>) shoes
veered sharply to the right and dragged him (<font color='blue'><b>Grover</b></font>) in the opposite direction.
The slope got steeper. Grover picked up speed. Annabeth and I had to sprint to keep up. The
cavern walls narrowed on either side, and I realized we'd entered some kind of side tunnel. No black
grass or trees now, just rock underfoot, and the dim light of the stalactites above.
<div class="bookquote">``Grover!''  (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div>I yelled, my voice echoing. <div class="bookquote">``Hold on to something!''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``What?''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Grover</b></font>) yelled back.
He (<font color='blue'><b>Grover</b></font>) was grabbing at gravel, but there was nothing big enough to slow him (<font color='blue'><b>Grover</b></font>) down.
The tunnel got darker and colder. The hairs on my arms bristled. It smelled evil down here. It
made me think of things I shouldn't even know about-blood spilled on an ancient stone altar, the foul
breath of a murderer.
Then I saw what was ahead of us, and I stopped dead in my tracks.

<p/>The tunnel widened into a huge dark cavern, and in the middle was a chasm the size of a city
block.
Grover was sliding straight toward the edge.
<div class="bookquote">``Come on, Percy!''  (<font color='red'><b>Annabeth/ANNABETH</b></font>)</div>Annabeth yelled, tugging at my wrist.
``But that's-``
<div class="bookquote">``I know!''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>my</b></font>) shouted. <div class="bookquote">``The place you described in your dream! But Grover's going to fall if we
don't catch him (<font color='blue'><b>Grover</b></font>).''  (<font color='red'><b>She</b></font>)</div>She (<font color='blue'><b>my</b></font>) was right, of course. Grover's predicament got me moving again.
He (<font color='blue'><b>Grover</b></font>) was yelling, clawing at the ground, but the winged shoes kept dragging him (<font color='blue'><b>Grover</b></font>) toward the pit, and
it didn't look like we could possibly get to him (<font color='blue'><b>Grover</b></font>) in time.
What saved him (<font color='blue'><b>Grover</b></font>) were his (<font color='blue'><b>Grover</b></font>) hooves.
The flying sneakers had always been a loose fit on him (<font color='blue'><b>Grover</b></font>), and finally Grover hit a big rock and the
left shoe came flying off. It sped into the darkness, down into the chasm. The right shoe kept tugging
him (<font color='blue'><b>Grover</b></font>) along, but not as fast. Grover was able to slow himself down by grabbing on to the big rock and
using it like an anchor.
He (<font color='blue'><b>Grover</b></font>) was ten feet from the edge of the pit when we caught him (<font color='blue'><b>Grover</b></font>) and hauled him (<font color='blue'><b>Grover</b></font>) back up the slope.
The other winged shoe tugged itself off, circled around us angrily and kicked our heads in protest
before flying off into the chasm to join its twin.
We all collapsed, exhausted, on the obsidian gravel. My limbs felt like lead. Even my backpack
seemed heavier, as if somebody had filled it with rocks.
Grover was scratched up pretty bad. His (<font color='blue'><b>Grover</b></font>) hands were bleeding. His (<font color='blue'><b>Grover</b></font>) eyes had gone slit-pupiled,
goat style, the way they did whenever he (<font color='blue'><b>Grover</b></font>) was terrified.
<div class="bookquote">``I don't know how ...''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Grover</b></font>) panted. <div class="bookquote">``I didn't...''
 (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``Wait,''  (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div>I said. <div class="bookquote">``Listen.''
 (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div>I heard something-a deep whisper in the darkness.
Another few seconds, and Annabeth said, ``Percy, this place-``
<div class="bookquote">``Shh.''  (<font color='red'><b>Annabeth/ANNABETH</b></font>)</div>I stood.
The sound was getting louder, a muttering, evil voice from far, far below us. Coming from the pit.
Grover sat up. <div class="bookquote">``Wh-what's that noise?''
 (<font color='red'><b>Annabeth/ANNABETH</b></font>)</div>Annabeth heard it too, now. I could see it in her (<font color='blue'><b>they</b></font>) eyes. <div class="bookquote">``Tartarus. The entrance to Tartarus.''  (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div>I
uncapped Anaklusmos.
The bronze sword expanded, gleaming in the darkness, and the evil voice seemed to falter, just
for a moment, before resuming its chant.
I could almost make out words now, ancient, ancient words, older even than Greek. As if ...
<div class="bookquote">``Magic,''  (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div>I said.
<div class="bookquote">``We have to get out of here,''  (<font color='red'><b>Annabeth/ANNABETH</b></font>)</div>Annabeth said.
Together, we dragged Grover to his (<font color='blue'><b>Grover</b></font>) hooves and started back up the tunnel. My legs wouldn't
move fast enough. My backpack weighed me down. The voice got louder and angrier behind us, and
we broke into a run.
Not a moment too soon.
A cold blast of wind pulled at our backs, as if the entire pit were inhaling. For a terrifying
moment, I lost ground, my feet slipping in the gravel. If we'd been any closer to the edge, we
would've been sucked in.
We kept struggling forward, and finally reached the top of the tunnel, where the cavern widened
out into the Fields of Asphodel. The wind died. A wail of outrage echoed from deep in the tunnel.
Something was not happy we'd gotten away.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``What was that?''  (<font color='red'><b>Grover/Grover Underwood/GROVER</b></font>)</div>Grover panted, when we'd collapsed in the relative safety of a black poplar
grove. <div class="bookquote">``One of Hades's pets?''
 (<font color='red'><b>Annabeth/ANNABETH</b></font>)</div>Annabeth and I looked at each other. I could tell she (<font color='blue'><b>we</b></font>) was nursing an idea, probably the same one
she (<font color='blue'><b>we</b></font>)'d gotten during the taxi ride to L.A., but she (<font color='blue'><b>we</b></font>) was too scared to share it. That was enough to terrify
me.
I capped my sword, put the pen back in my pocket. <div class="bookquote">``Let's keep going.''  (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div>I looked at Grover. <div class="bookquote">``Can
you walk?''
 (<font color='red'><b>He</b></font>)</div>He (<font color='blue'><b>Grover</b></font>) swallowed. <div class="bookquote">``Yeah, sure. I never liked those shoes, anyway.''
 (<font color='red'><b>He</b></font>)</div>He (<font color='blue'><b>Grover</b></font>) tried to sound brave about it, but he (<font color='blue'><b>Grover</b></font>) was trembling as badly as Annabeth and I were. Whatever
was in that pit was nobody's pet. It was unspeakably old and powerful. Even Echidna hadn't given
me that feeling. I was almost relieved to turn my back on that tunnel and head toward the palace of
Hades.
Almost.
The Furies circled the parapets, high in the gloom. The outer walls of the fortress glittered black,
and the two-story-tall bronze gates stood wide open.
Up close, I saw that the engravings on the gates were scenes of death. Some were from modern
times-an atomic bomb exploding over a city, a trench filled with gas mask-wearing soldiers, a line of
African famine victims waiting with empty bowls-but all of them looked as if they'd been etched into
the bronze thousands of years ago. I wondered if I was looking at prophecies that had come true.
Inside the courtyard was the strangest garden I'd ever seen. Multicolored mushrooms, poisonous
shrubs, and weird luminous plants grew without sunlight. Precious jewels made up for the lack of
flowers, piles of rubies as big as my fist, clumps of raw diamonds. Standing here and there like
frozen party guests were Medusa's garden statues- petrified children, satyrs, and centaurs-all smiling
grotesquely.
In the center of the garden was an orchard of pomegranate trees, their orange blooms neon bright
in the dark. <div class="bookquote">``The garden of Persephone,''  (<font color='red'><b>Annabeth/ANNABETH</b></font>)</div>Annabeth said. <div class="bookquote">``Keep walking.''
 (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div>I understood why she (<font color='blue'><b>Medusa</b></font>) wanted to move on. The tart smell of those pomegranates was almost
overwhelming. I had a sudden desire to eat them, but then I remembered the story of Persephone. One
bite of Underworld food, and we would never be able to leave. I pulled Grover away to keep him (<font color='blue'><b>Grover</b></font>)
from picking a big juicy one.
We walked up the steps of the palace, between black columns, through a black marble portico,
and into the house of Hades. The entry hall had a polished bronze floor, which seemed to boil in the
reflected torchlight. There was no ceiling, just the cavern roof, far above. I guess they never had to
worry about rain down here.
Every side doorway was guarded by a skeleton in military gear. Some wore Greek armor, some
British redcoat uniforms, some camouflage with tattered American flags on the shoulders. They
carried spears or muskets or M-16s. None of them bothered us, but their hollow eye sockets followed
us as we walked down the hall, toward the big set of doors at the opposite end.
Two U.S. Marine skeletons guarded the doors. They grinned down at us, rocket-propelled
grenade launchers held across their chests.
<div class="bookquote">``You know,''  (<font color='red'><b>Grover/Grover Underwood/GROVER</b></font>)</div>Grover mumbled, <div class="bookquote">``I bet Hades doesn't have trouble with door-to-door salesmen.''
 (<font color='red'><b>Grover/Grover Underwood/GROVER</b></font>)</div>My backpack weighed a ton now. I couldn't figure out why. I wanted to open it, check to see if I
had somehow picked up a stray bowling ball, but this wasn't the time.
<div class="bookquote">``Well, guys,''  (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div>I said. <div class="bookquote">``I suppose we should ... knock?''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>A hot wind blew down the corridor, and the doors swung open. The guards stepped aside.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``I guess that means entrez-vous,''  (<font color='red'><b>Annabeth/ANNABETH</b></font>)</div>Annabeth said.
The room inside looked just like in my dream, except this time the throne of Hades was occupied.
He (<font color='blue'><b>Grover</b></font>) was the third god I'd met, but the first who really struck me as godlike.
He (<font color='blue'><b>Grover</b></font>) was at least ten feet tall, for one thing, and dressed in black silk robes and a crown of braided
gold. His (<font color='blue'><b>Grover</b></font>) skin was albino white, his (<font color='blue'><b>Grover</b></font>) hair shoulder-length and jet black. He (<font color='blue'><b>Grover</b></font>) wasn't bulked up like
Ares, but he (<font color='blue'><b>Grover</b></font>) radiated power. He (<font color='blue'><b>Grover</b></font>) lounged on his (<font color='blue'><b>Grover</b></font>) throne of fused human bones, looking lithe, graceful,
and dangerous as a panther.
I immediately felt like he (<font color='blue'><b>Grover</b></font>) should be giving the orders. He (<font color='blue'><b>Grover</b></font>) knew more than I did. He (<font color='blue'><b>Grover</b></font>) should be my
master. Then I told myself to snap out of it.
Hades's aura was affecting me, just as Ares's had. The Lord of the Dead resembled pictures I'd
seen of Adolph Hitler, or Napoleon, or the terrorist leaders who direct suicide bombers. Hades had
the same intense eyes, the same kind of mesmerizing, evil charisma.
<div class="bookquote">``You are brave to come here, Son of Poseidon,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Napoleon</b></font>) said in an oily voice. <div class="bookquote">``After what you have
done to me, very brave indeed. Or perhaps you are simply very foolish.''
 (<font color='red'><b>me</b></font>)</div>Numbness crept into my joints, tempting me to lie down and just take a little nap at Hades's feet.
Curl up here and sleep forever.
I fought the feeling and stepped forward. I knew what I had to say. <div class="bookquote">``Lord and Uncle, I come with
two requests.''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>Hades raised an eyebrow. When he (<font color='blue'><b>Napoleon</b></font>) sat forward in his (<font color='blue'><b>Napoleon</b></font>) throne, shadowy faces appeared in the
folds of his (<font color='blue'><b>Napoleon</b></font>) black robes, faces of torment, as if the garment were stitched of trapped souls from the
Fields of Punishment, trying to get out. The ADHD part of me wondered, off-task, whether the rest of
his (<font color='blue'><b>Napoleon</b></font>) clothes were made the same way. What horrible things would you have to do in your life to get
woven into Hades's underwear?
<div class="bookquote">``Only two requests?''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>Hades said. <div class="bookquote">``Arrogant child. As if you have not already taken enough.
Speak, then. It amuses me not to strike you dead yet.''
 (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div>I swallowed. This was going about as well as I'd feared.
I glanced at the empty, smaller throne next to Hades's. It was shaped like a black flower, gilded
with gold. I wished Queen Persephone were here. I recalled something in the myths about how she (<font color='blue'><b>Queen</b></font>)
could calm her (<font color='blue'><b>Queen</b></font>) husband's moods. But it was summer. Of course, Persephone would be above in the
world of light with her (<font color='blue'><b>Persephone</b></font>) mother, the goddess of agriculture, Demeter. Her (<font color='blue'><b>Persephone</b></font>) visits, not the tilt of the
planet, create the seasons.
Annabeth cleared her (<font color='blue'><b>Persephone</b></font>) throat. Her (<font color='blue'><b>Persephone</b></font>) finger prodded me in the back.
<div class="bookquote">``Lord Hades,''  (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div>I said. <div class="bookquote">``Look, sir, there can't be a war among the gods. It would be ... bad.''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``Really bad,''  (<font color='red'><b>Grover/Grover Underwood/GROVER</b></font>)</div>Grover added helpfully.
<div class="bookquote">``Return Zeus's master bolt to me,''  (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div>I said. <div class="bookquote">``Please, sir. Let me carry it to Olympus.''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>Hades's eyes grew dangerously bright. <div class="bookquote">``You dare keep up this pretense, after what you have
done?''
 (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div>I glanced back at my friends. They looked as confused as I was.
<div class="bookquote">``Um ... Uncle,''  (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div>I said. <div class="bookquote">``You keep saying `after what you've done.' What exactly have I done?''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>The throne room shook with a tremor so strong, they probably felt it upstairs in Los Angeles.
Debris fell from the cavern ceiling. Doors burst open all along the walls, and skeletal warriors
marched in, hundreds of them, from every time period and nation in Western civilization. They lined
the perimeter of the room, blocking the exits.
Hades bellowed, <div class="bookquote">``Do you think I want war, godling?''
 (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div>I wanted to say, Well, these guys don't look like peace activists. But I thought that might be a

<p/>dangerous answer.
<div class="bookquote">``You are the Lord of the Dead,''  (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div>I said carefully. <div class="bookquote">``A war would expand your kingdom, right?''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``A typical thing for my brothers to say! Do you think I need more subjects? Did you not see the
sprawl of the Asphodel Fields?''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``Well...''
 (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``Have you any idea how much my kingdom has swollen in this past century alone, how many
subdivisions I've had to open?''
 (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div>I opened my mouth to respond, but Hades was on a roll now.
<div class="bookquote">``More security ghouls,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>I</b></font>) moaned. <div class="bookquote">``Traffic problems at the judgment pavilion. Double overtime
for the staff. I used to be a rich god, Percy Jackson. I control all the precious metals under the earth.
But my expenses!''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``Charon wants a pay raise,''  (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div>I blurted, just remembering the fact. As soon as I said it, I wished I
could sew up my mouth.
<div class="bookquote">``Don't get me started on Charon!''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>Hades yelled. <div class="bookquote">``He (<font color='blue'><b>Charon</b></font>)'s been impossible ever since he (<font color='blue'><b>Charon</b></font>) discovered
Italian suits! Problems everywhere, and I've got to handle all of them personally. The commute time
alone from the palace to the gates is enough to drive me insane! And the dead just keep arriving. No,
godling. I need no help getting subjects! I did not ask for this war.''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``But you took Zeus's master bolt.''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``Lies!''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>More rumbling. Hades rose from his (<font color='blue'><b>I</b></font>) throne, towering to the height of a football goalpost.
<div class="bookquote">``Your father may fool Zeus, boy, but I am not so stupid. I see his (<font color='blue'><b>Zeus</b></font>) plan.''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``His (<font color='blue'><b>Zeus</b></font>) plan?''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``You were the thief on the winter solstice,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>I</b></font>) said. <div class="bookquote">``Your father thought to keep you his (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) little
secret. He (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) directed you into the throne room on Olympus, You took the master bolt and my helm. Had
I not sent my Fury to discover you at Yancy Academy, Poseidon might have succeeded in hiding his (<font color='blue'><b>Academy</b></font>)
scheme to start a war. But now you have been forced into the open. You will be exposed as
Poseidon's thief, and I will have my helm back!''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``But ...''  (<font color='red'><b>Annabeth/ANNABETH</b></font>)</div>Annabeth spoke. I could tell her (<font color='blue'><b>I</b></font>) mind was going a million miles an hour. <div class="bookquote">``Lord Hades,
your helm of darkness is missing, too?''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``Do not play innocent with me, girl. You and the satyr have been helping this hero-coming here to
threaten me in Poseidon's name, no doubt-to bring me an ultimatum. Does Poseidon think I can be
blackmailed into supporting him (<font color='blue'><b>Lord</b></font>)?''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``No!''  (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div>I said. ``Poseidon didn't-I didn't-``
<div class="bookquote">``I have said nothing of the helm's disappearance,''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>Hades snarled, <div class="bookquote">``because I had no illusions that
anyone on Olympus would offer me the slightest justice, the slightest help. I can ill afford for word to
get out that my most powerful weapon of fear is missing. So I searched for you myself, and when it
was clear you were coming to me to deliver your threat, I did not try to stop you.''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>``You didn't try to stop us? But-``
<div class="bookquote">``Return my helm now, or I will stop death,''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>Hades threatened. <div class="bookquote">``That is my counterproposal. I
will open the earth and have the dead pour back into the world. I will make your lands a nightmare.
And you, Percy Jackson-your skeleton will lead my army out of Hades.''
 (<font color='red'><b>The soldiers</b></font>)</div>The skeletal soldiers all took one step forward, making their weapons ready.
At that point, I probably should have been terrified. The strange thing was, I felt offended.
Nothing gets me angrier than being accused of something I didn't do. I've had a lot of experience with
that.
<div class="bookquote">``You're as bad as Zeus,''  (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div>I said. ``You think I stole from you? That's why you sent the Furies after

<p/>me?''
``Of course,'' Hades said.
``And the other monsters?''
Hades curled his (<font color='blue'><b>I</b></font>) lip. ``I had nothing to do with them. I wanted no quick death for you-I wanted you
brought before me alive so you might face every torture in the Fields of Punishment. Why do you think
I let you enter my kingdom so easily?''
``Easily?''
``Return my property!''
``But I don't have your helm. I came for the master bolt.''
``Which you already possess!'' Hades shouted. ``You came here with it, little fool, thinking you
could you threaten me!''
``But I didn't!''
``Open your pack, then.''
A horrible feeling struck me. The weight in my backpack, like a bowling ball. It couldn't be....
I slung it off my shoulder and unzipped it. Inside was a two-foot-long metal cylinder, spiked on
both ends, humming with energy.
``Percy,'' Annabeth said. ``How-``
``I-I don't know. I don't understand.''
``You heroes are always the same,'' Hades said. ``Your pride makes you foolish, thinking you
could bring such a weapon before me. I did not ask for Zeus's master bolt, but since it is here, you
will yield it to me. I am sure it will make an excellent bargaining tool. And now ... my helm. Where
is it?''
I was speechless. I had no helm. I had no idea how the master bolt had gotten into my backpack. I
wanted to think Hades was pulling some kind of trick. Hades was the bad guy. But suddenly the world
turned sideways. I realized I'd been played with. Zeus, Poseidon, and Hades had been set at each
other's throats by someone else. The master bolt had been in the backpack, and I'd gotten the
backpack from ...
``Lord Hades, wait,'' I said. ``This is all a mistake.''
``A mistake?'' Hades roared.
The skeletons aimed their weapons. From high above, there was a fluttering of leathery wings,
and the three Furies swooped down to perch on the back of their master's throne. The one with Mrs.
Dodds's face grinned at me eagerly and flicked her (<font color='blue'><b>Dodds</b></font>) whip.
``There is no mistake,'' Hades said. ``I know why you have come-I know the real reason you
brought the bolt. You came to bargain for her (<font color='blue'><b>it</b></font>).''
Hades loosed a ball of gold fire from his (<font color='blue'><b>master</b></font>) palm. It exploded on the steps in front of me, and there
was my mother, frozen in a shower of gold, just as she (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) was at the moment when the Minotaur began to
squeeze her (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) to death.
I couldn't speak. I reached out to touch her (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>), but the light was as hot as a bonfire.
``Yes,'' Hades said with satisfaction. ``I took her (<font color='blue'><b>it</b></font>). I knew, Percy Jackson, that you would come to
bargain with me eventually. Return my helm, and perhaps I will let her (<font color='blue'><b>it</b></font>) go. She (<font color='blue'><b>it</b></font>) is not dead, you know.
Not yet. But if you displease me, that will change.''
I thought about the pearls in my pocket. Maybe they could get me out of this. If I could just get my
mom free ...
``Ah, the pearls,'' Hades said, and my blood froze. <div class="bookquote">``Yes, my brother and his (<font color='blue'><b>brother</b></font>) little tricks. Bring
them forth, Percy Jackson.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/>My hand moved against my will and brought out the pearls.
<div class="bookquote">``Only three,''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>Hades said. <div class="bookquote">``What a shame. You do realize each only protects a single person. Try
to take your mother, then, little godling. And which of your friends will you leave behind to spend
eternity with me? Go on. Choose. Or give me the backpack and accept my terms.''
 (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div>I looked at Annabeth and Grover. Their faces were grim.
<div class="bookquote">``We were tricked,''  (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div>I told them. <div class="bookquote">``Set up.''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``Yes, but why?''  (<font color='red'><b>Annabeth/ANNABETH</b></font>)</div>Annabeth asked. ``And the voice in the pit-``
<div class="bookquote">``I don't know yet,''  (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div>I said. <div class="bookquote">``But I intend to ask.''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``Decide, boy!''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>Hades yelled.
<div class="bookquote">``Percy.''  (<font color='red'><b>Grover/Grover Underwood/GROVER</b></font>)</div>Grover put his (<font color='blue'><b>Grover</b></font>) hand on my shoulder. <div class="bookquote">``You can't give him (<font color='blue'><b>Percy</b></font>) the bolt,''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``I know that.''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``Leave me here,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Grover</b></font>) said. <div class="bookquote">``Use the third pearl on your mom.''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``No!''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``I'm a satyr,''  (<font color='red'><b>Grover/Grover Underwood/GROVER</b></font>)</div>Grover said. <div class="bookquote">``We don't have souls like humans do. He (<font color='blue'><b>Percy</b></font>) can torture me until I die,
but he (<font color='blue'><b>Percy</b></font>) won't get me forever. I'll just be reincarnated as a flower or something. It's the best way.''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``No.''  (<font color='red'><b>Annabeth/ANNABETH</b></font>)</div>Annabeth drew her (<font color='blue'><b>mom</b></font>) bronze knife. <div class="bookquote">``You two go on. Grover, you have to protect Percy. You
have to get your searcher's license and start your quest for Pan. Get his (<font color='blue'><b>Grover</b></font>) mom out of here. I'll cover
you. I plan to go down fighting.''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``No way,''  (<font color='red'><b>Grover/Grover Underwood/GROVER</b></font>)</div>Grover said. <div class="bookquote">``I'm staying behind.''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``Think again, goat boy,''  (<font color='red'><b>Annabeth/ANNABETH</b></font>)</div>Annabeth said.
<div class="bookquote">``Stop it, both of you!''  (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div>I felt like my heart was being ripped in two. They had both been with me
through so much. I remembered Grover dive-bombing Medusa in the statue garden, and Annabeth
saving us from Cerberus; we'd survived Hephaestus's Waterland ride, the St. Louis Arch, the Lotus
Casino. I had spent thousands of miles worried that I'd be betrayed by a friend, but these friends
would never do that. They had done nothing but save me, over and over, and now they wanted to
sacrifice their lives for my mom.
<div class="bookquote">``I know what to do,''  (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div>I said. <div class="bookquote">``Take these.''
 (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div>I handed them each a pearl.
Annabeth said, <div class="bookquote">``But, Percy ...''
 (<font color='red'><b>Annabeth/ANNABETH</b></font>)</div>I turned and faced my mother. I desperately wanted to sacrifice myself and use the last pearl on
her (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>), but I knew what she (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) would say. She (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) would never allow it. I had to get the bolt back to Olympus
and tell Zeus the truth. I had to stop the war. She (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) would never forgive me if I saved her (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) instead. I
thought about the prophecy made at Half-Blood Hill, what seemed like a million years ago. You will
fail to save what matters most in the end.
<div class="bookquote">``I'm sorry,''  (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div>I told her (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>). <div class="bookquote">``I'll be back. I'll find a way.''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>The smug look on Hades's face faded. He (<font color='blue'><b>Zeus</b></font>) said, <div class="bookquote">``Godling ... ?''
 (<font color='red'><b>He</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``I'll find your helm, Uncle,''  (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div>I told him (<font color='blue'><b>Zeus</b></font>). <div class="bookquote">``I'll return it. Remember about Charon's pay raise.''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>``Do not defy me-``
<div class="bookquote">``And it wouldn't hurt to play with Cerberus once in a while. He (<font color='blue'><b>Charon</b></font>) likes red rubber balls.''
 (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div>``Percy Jackson, you will not-``
I shouted, <div class="bookquote">``Now, guys!''
 (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div>We smashed the pearls at our feet. For a scary moment, nothing happened.
Hades yelled, <div class="bookquote">``Destroy them!''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>The army of skeletons rushed forward, swords out, guns clicking to full automatic. The Furies
lunged, their whips bursting into flame.

<p/>Just as the skeletons opened fire, the pearl fragments at my feet exploded with a burst of green
light and a gust of fresh sea wind. I was encased in a milky white sphere, which was starting to float
off the ground.
Annabeth and Grover were right behind me. Spears and bullets sparked harmlessly off the pearl
bubbles as we floated up. Hades yelled with such rage, the entire fortress shook and I knew it was not
going to be a peaceful night in L.A.
``Look up.''' Grover yelled. ``We're going to crash!''
Sure enough, we were racing right toward the stalactites, which I figured would pop our bubbles
and skewer us.
``How do you control these things?'' Annabeth shouted.
``I don't think you do!'' I shouted back.
We screamed as the bubbles slammed into the ceiling and ... Darkness.
Were we dead?
No, I could still feel the racing sensation. We were going up, right through solid rock as easily as
an air bubble in water. That was the power of the pearls, I realized-What belongs to the sea will
always return to the sea.
For a few moments, I couldn't see anything outside the smooth walls of my sphere, then my pearl
broke through on the ocean floor. The two other milky spheres, Annabeth and Grover, kept pace with
me as we soared upward through the water. And-ker-blam!
We exploded on the surface, in the middle of the Santa Monica Bay, knocking a surfer off his (<font color='blue'><b>Santa</b></font>)
board with an indignant, ``Dude!''
I grabbed Grover and hauled him (<font color='blue'><b>Grover</b></font>) over to a life buoy. I caught Annabeth and dragged her (<font color='blue'><b>Monica</b></font>) over too.
A curious shark was circling us, a great white about eleven feet long.
I said, <div class="bookquote">``Beat it.''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>The shark turned and raced away.
The surfer screamed something about bad mushrooms and paddled away from us as fast as he (<font color='blue'><b>surfer</b></font>)
could.
Somehow, I knew what time it was: early morning, June 21, the day of the summer solstice.
In the distance, Los Angeles was on fire, plumes of smoke rising from neighborhoods all over the
city. There had been an earthquake, all right, and it was Hades's fault. He (<font color='blue'><b>surfer</b></font>) was probably sending an
army of the dead after me right now.
But at the moment, the Underworld wasn't my biggest problem.
I had to get to shore. I had to get Zeus's thunderbolt back to Olympus. Most of all, I had to have a
serious conversation with the god who'd tricked me.

<p/>Percy Jackson 1 - The Lightning Thief
20 I BATTLE MY
JERK RELATIVE
A Coast Guard boat picked us up, but they were too busy to keep us for long, or to wonder how
three kids in street clothes had gotten out into the middle of the bay. There was a disaster to mop up.
Their radios were jammed with distress calls.
They dropped us off at the Santa Monica Pier with towels around our shoulders and water bottles
that said I'M A JUNIOR COAST GUARD! and sped off to save more people.
Our clothes were sopping wet, even mine. When the Coast Guard boat had appeared, I'd silently
prayed they wouldn't pick me out of the water and find me perfectly dry, which might've raised some
eyebrows. So I'd willed myself to get soaked. Sure enough, my usual waterproof magic had
abandoned me. I was also barefoot, because I'd given my shoes to Grover. Better the Coast Guard
wonder why one of us was barefoot than wonder why one of us had hooves.
After reaching dry land, we stumbled down the beach, watching the city burn against a beautiful
sunrise. I felt as if I'd just come back from the dead-which I had. My backpack was heavy with
Zeus's master bolt. My heart was even heavier from seeing my mother.
<div class="bookquote">``I don't believe it,''  (<font color='red'><b>Annabeth/ANNABETH</b></font>)</div>Annabeth said. ``We went all that way-``
<div class="bookquote">``It was a trick,''  (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div>I said. <div class="bookquote">``A strategy worthy of Athena.''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``Hey,''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) warned.
<div class="bookquote">``You get it, don't you?''
 (<font color='red'><b>She</b></font>)</div>She (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) dropped her (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) eyes, her (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) anger fading. <div class="bookquote">``Yeah. I get it.''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``Well, I don't!''  (<font color='red'><b>Grover/Grover Underwood/GROVER</b></font>)</div>Grover complained. ``Would somebody-``
<div class="bookquote">``Percy ...''  (<font color='red'><b>Annabeth/ANNABETH</b></font>)</div>Annabeth said. <div class="bookquote">``I'm sorry about your mother. I'm so sorry....''
 (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div>I pretended not to hear her (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>). If I talked about my mother, I was going to start crying like a little kid.
<div class="bookquote">``The prophecy was right,''  (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div>I said. <div class="bookquote">``You shall go west and face the god who has turned.' But it
wasn't Hades. Hades didn't want war among the Big Three. Someone else pulled off the theft.
Someone stole Zeus's master bolt, and Hades's helm, and framed me because I'm Poseidon's kid.
Poseidon will get blamed by both sides. By sundown today, there will be a three-way war. And I'll
have caused it.''
 (<font color='red'><b>Grover/Grover Underwood/GROVER</b></font>)</div>Grover shook his (<font color='blue'><b>Grover</b></font>) head, mystified. <div class="bookquote">``But who would be that sneaky? Who would want war that
bad?''
 (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div>I stopped in my tracks, looking down the beach. <div class="bookquote">``Gee, let me think.''
 (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>There he (<font color='blue'><b>Grover</b></font>) was, waiting for us, in his (<font color='blue'><b>Grover</b></font>) black leather duster and his (<font color='blue'><b>Grover</b></font>) sunglasses, an aluminum baseball
bat propped on his (<font color='blue'><b>Grover</b></font>) shoulder. His (<font color='blue'><b>Grover</b></font>) motorcycle rumbled beside him (<font color='blue'><b>Grover</b></font>), its headlight turning the sand red.
<div class="bookquote">``Hey, kid,''  (<font color='red'><b>Ares</b></font>)</div>Ares said, seeming genuinely pleased to see me. <div class="bookquote">``You were supposed to die.''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``You tricked me,''  (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div>I said. <div class="bookquote">``You stole the helm and the master bolt.''
 (<font color='red'><b>Ares</b></font>)</div>Ares grinned. <div class="bookquote">``Well, now, I didn't steal them personally. Gods taking each other's symbols of
power-that's a big no-no. But you're not the only hero in the world who can run errands.''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``Who did you use? Clarisse? She (<font color='blue'><b>Clarisse</b></font>) was there at the winter solstice.''
 (<font color='red'><b>him</b></font>)</div>The idea seemed to amuse him (<font color='blue'><b>Grover</b></font>). ``Doesn't matter. The point is, kid, you're impeding the war effort.
See, you've got to die in the Underworld. Then Old Seaweed will be mad at Hades for killing you.

<p/>Corpse Breath will have Zeus's master bolt, so Zeus'll be mad at him (<font color='blue'><b>Zeus</b></font>). And Hades is still looking for
this ...''
From his (<font color='blue'><b>Grover</b></font>) pocket he (<font color='blue'><b>Grover</b></font>) took out a ski cap-the kind bank robbers wear-and placed it between the
handlebars of his (<font color='blue'><b>Grover</b></font>) bike. Immediately, the cap transformed into an elaborate bronze war helmet.
``The helm of darkness,'' Grover gasped.
``Exactly,'' Ares said. ``Now where was I? Oh yeah, Hades will be mad at both Zeus and
Poseidon, because he (<font color='blue'><b>Zeus</b></font>) doesn't know who took this. Pretty soon, we got a nice little three-way slugfest
going.''
``But they're your family!'' Annabeth protested.
Ares shrugged. ``Best kind of war. Always the bloodiest. Nothing like watching your relatives
fight, I always say.''
``You gave me the backpack in Denver,'' I said. ``The master bolt was in there the whole time.''
``Yes and no,'' Ares said. ``It's probably too complicated for your little mortal brain to follow, but
the backpack is the master bolt's sheath, just morphed a bit. The bolt is connected to it, sort of like
that sword you got, kid. It always returns to your pocket, right?''
I wasn't sure how Ares knew about that, but I guess a god of war had to make it his (<font color='blue'><b>god</b></font>) business to
know about weapons.
``Anyway,'' Ares continued, ``I tinkered with the magic a bit, so the bolt would only return to the
sheath once you reached the Underworld. You get close to Hades.... Bingo, you got mail. If you died
along the way-no loss. I still had the weapon.''
``But why not just keep the master bolt for yourself?'' I said. ``Why send it to Hades?''
Ares got a twitch in his (<font color='blue'><b>god</b></font>) jaw. For a moment, it was almost as if he (<font color='blue'><b>god</b></font>) were listening to another voice,
deep inside his (<font color='blue'><b>god</b></font>) head. ``Why didn't I ... yeah ... with that kind of firepower ...''
He (<font color='blue'><b>god</b></font>) held the trance for one second ... two seconds....
I exchanged nervous looks with Annabeth.
Ares's face cleared. ``I didn't want the trouble. Better to have you caught redhanded, holding the
thing.''
``You're lying,'' I said. ``Sending the bolt to the Underworld wasn't your idea, was it?''
``Of course it was!'' Smoke drifted up from his (<font color='blue'><b>god</b></font>) sunglasses, as if they were about to catch fire.
``You didn't order the theft,'' I guessed. ``Someone else sent a hero to steal the two items. Then,
when Zeus sent you to hunt him (<font color='blue'><b>Zeus</b></font>) down, you caught the thief. But you didn't turn him (<font color='blue'><b>Zeus</b></font>) over to Zeus.
Something convinced you to let him (<font color='blue'><b>Zeus</b></font>) go. You kept the items until another hero could come along and
complete the delivery. That thing in the pit is ordering you around.''
``I am the god of war! I take orders from no one! I don't have dreams!''
I hesitated. ``Who said anything about dreams?''
Ares looked agitated, but he (<font color='blue'><b>god</b></font>) tried to cover it with a smirk.
``Let's get back to the problem at hand, kid. You're alive. I can't have you taking that bolt to
Olympus. You just might get those hardheaded idiots to listen to you. So I've got to kill you. Nothing
personal.''
He (<font color='blue'><b>god</b></font>) snapped his (<font color='blue'><b>god</b></font>) fingers. The sand exploded at his (<font color='blue'><b>god</b></font>) feet and out charged a wild boar, even larger
and uglier than the one whose head hung above the door of cabin seven at Camp Half-Blood. The
beast pawed the sand, glaring at me with beady eyes as it lowered its razor-sharp tusks and waited
for the command to kill.
I stepped into the surf. ``Fight me yourself, Ares.''
He (<font color='blue'><b>god</b></font>) laughed, but I heard a little edge to his (<font color='blue'><b>god</b></font>) laughter ... an uneasiness. ``You've only got one talent,

<p/>kid, running away. You ran from the Chimera. You ran from the Underworld. You don't have what it
takes.''
``Scared?''
``In your adolescent dreams.'' But his (<font color='blue'><b>god</b></font>) sunglasses were starting to melt from the heat of his (<font color='blue'><b>god</b></font>) eyes.
``No direct involvement. Sorry, kid. You're not at my level.''
Annabeth said, ``Percy, run!''
The giant boar charged.
But I was done running from monsters. Or Hades, or Ares, or anybody.
As the boar rushed me, I uncapped my pen and sidestepped. Riptide appeared in my hands. I
slashed upward. The boar's severed right tusk fell at my feet, while the disoriented animal charged
into the sea.
I shouted, ``Wave!''
Immediately, a wave surged up from nowhere and engulfed the boar, wrapping around it like a
blanket. The beast squealed once in terror. Then it was gone, swallowed by the sea.
I turned back to Ares. ``Are you going to fight me now?'' I asked. ``Or are you going to hide behind
another pet?''
Ares's face was purple with rage. ``Watch it, kid. I could turn you into-``
``A cockroach,'' I said. ``Or a tapeworm. Yeah, I'm sure. That'd save you from getting your godly
hide whipped, wouldn't it?''
Flames danced along the top of his (<font color='blue'><b>it</b></font>) glasses. ``Oh, man, you are really asking to be smashed into a
grease spot.''
``If I lose, turn me into anything you want. Take the bolt. If I win, the helm and the bolt are mine
and you have to go away.''
Ares sneered.
He (<font color='blue'><b>it</b></font>) swung the baseball bat off his (<font color='blue'><b>it</b></font>) shoulder. ``How would you like to get smashed: classic or
modern?''
I showed him (<font color='blue'><b>it</b></font>) my sword.
``That's cool, dead boy,'' he (<font color='blue'><b>it</b></font>) said. ``Classic it is.'' The baseball bat changed into a huge, twohanded sword. The hilt was a large silver skull with a ruby in its mouth.
``Percy,'' Annabeth said. ``Don't do this. He (<font color='blue'><b>Percy</b></font>)'s a god.''
``He (<font color='blue'><b>Percy</b></font>)'s a coward,'' I told her (<font color='blue'><b>it</b></font>).
She (<font color='blue'><b>it</b></font>) swallowed. ``Wear this, at least. For luck.''
She (<font color='blue'><b>it</b></font>) took off her (<font color='blue'><b>it</b></font>) necklace, with her (<font color='blue'><b>it</b></font>) five years' worth of camp beads and the ring from her (<font color='blue'><b>it</b></font>) father,
and tied it around my neck.
``Reconciliation,'' she (<font color='blue'><b>it</b></font>) said. ``Athena and Poseidon together.''
My face felt a little warm, but I managed a smile. ``Thanks.''
``And take this,'' Grover said. He (<font color='blue'><b>Grover</b></font>) handed me a flattened tin can that he (<font color='blue'><b>Grover</b></font>)'d probably been saving in
his (<font color='blue'><b>Grover</b></font>) pocket for a thousand miles. ``The satyrs stand behind you.''
``Grover ... I don't know what to say.''
He (<font color='blue'><b>Grover</b></font>) patted me on the shoulder. I stuffed the tin can in my back pocket.
``You all done saying good-bye?'' Ares came toward me, his (<font color='blue'><b>Grover</b></font>) black leather duster trailing behind
him (<font color='blue'><b>Grover</b></font>), his (<font color='blue'><b>Grover</b></font>) sword glinting like fire in the sunrise. <div class="bookquote">``I've been fighting for eternity, kid. My strength is
unlimited and I cannot die. What have you got?''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>A smaller ego, I thought, but I said nothing. I kept my feet in the surf, backing into the water up to
my ankles. I thought back to what Annabeth had said at the Denver diner, so long ago: Ares has

<p/>strength. That's all he (<font color='blue'><b>Grover</b></font>) has. Even strength has to how to wisdom sometimes.
He (<font color='blue'><b>Grover</b></font>) cleaved downward at my head, but I wasn't there.
My body thought for me. The water seemed to push me into the air and I catapulted over him (<font color='blue'><b>Grover</b></font>),
slashing as I came down. But Ares was just as quick. He (<font color='blue'><b>Grover</b></font>) twisted, and the strike that should've caught
him (<font color='blue'><b>Grover</b></font>) directly in the spine was deflected off the end of his (<font color='blue'><b>Grover</b></font>) sword hilt.
He (<font color='blue'><b>Grover</b></font>) grinned. <div class="bookquote">``Not bad, not bad.''
 (<font color='red'><b>He</b></font>)</div>He (<font color='blue'><b>Grover</b></font>) slashed again and I was forced to jump onto dry land. I tried to sidestep, to get back to the
water, but Ares seemed to know what I wanted. He (<font color='blue'><b>Grover</b></font>) outmaneuvered me, pressing so hard I had to put
all my concentration on not getting sliced into pieces. I kept backing away from the surf. I couldn't
find any openings to attack. His (<font color='blue'><b>Grover</b></font>) sword had a reach several feet longer than Anaklusmos.
Get in close, Luke had told me once, back in our sword class. When you've got the shorter blade,
get in close.
I stepped inside with a thrust, but Ares was waiting for that. He (<font color='blue'><b>Luke</b></font>) knocked my blade out of my
hands and kicked me in the chest. I went airborne-twenty, maybe thirty feet. I would've broken my
back if I hadn't crashed into the soft sand of a dune.
<div class="bookquote">``Percy!''  (<font color='red'><b>Annabeth/ANNABETH</b></font>)</div>Annabeth yelled. <div class="bookquote">``Cops!''
 (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div>I was seeing double. My chest felt like it had just been hit with a battering ram, but I managed to
get to my feet.
I couldn't look away from Ares for fear he (<font color='blue'><b>Luke</b></font>)'d slice me in half, but out of the corner of my eye I
saw red lights flashing on the shoreline boulevard. Car doors were slamming.
<div class="bookquote">``There, officer!''  (<font color='red'><b>somebody</b></font>)</div>somebody yelled. <div class="bookquote">``See?''
 (<font color='red'><b>cop</b></font>)</div>A gruff cop voice: <div class="bookquote">``Looks like that kid on TV ... what the heck ...''
 (<font color='red'><b>cop</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``That guy's armed,''  (<font color='red'><b>cop</b></font>)</div>another cop said. <div class="bookquote">``Call for backup.''
 (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div>I rolled to one side as Ares's blade slashed the sand.
I ran for my sword, scooped it up, and launched a swipe at Ares's face, only to find my blade
deflected again.
Ares seemed to know exactly what I was going to do the moment before I did it.
I stepped back toward the surf, forcing him (<font color='blue'><b>cop</b></font>) to follow.
<div class="bookquote">``Admit it, kid,''  (<font color='red'><b>Ares</b></font>)</div>Ares said. <div class="bookquote">``You got no hope. I'm just toying with you.''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>My senses were working overtime. I now understood what Annabeth had said about ADHD
keeping you alive in battle. I was wide awake, noticing every little detail.
I could see where Ares was tensing. I could tell which way he (<font color='blue'><b>cop</b></font>) would strike. At the same time, I
was aware of Annabeth and Grover, thirty feet to my left. I saw a second cop car pulling up, siren
wailing. Spectators, people who had been wandering the streets because of the earthquake, were
starting to gather. Among the crowd, I thought I saw a few who were walking with the strange, trotting
gait of disguised satyrs. There were shimmering forms of spirits, too, as if the dead had risen from
Hades to watch the battle. I heard the flap of leathery wings circling somewhere above.
More sirens.
I stepped farther into the water, but Ares was fast. The tip of his (<font color='blue'><b>cop</b></font>) blade ripped my sleeve and
grazed my forearm.
A police voice on a megaphone said, <div class="bookquote">``Drop the guns.' Set them on the ground. Now!''
 (<font color='red'><b>police</b></font>)</div>Guns?
I looked at Ares's weapon, and it seemed to be flickering; sometimes it looked like a shotgun,
sometimes a two-handed sword. I didn't know what the humans were seeing in my hands, but I was
pretty sure it wouldn't make them like me.

<p/>Ares turned to glare at our spectators, which gave me a moment to breathe. There were five
police cars now, and a line of officers crouching behind them, pistols trained on us.
<div class="bookquote">``This is a private matter!''  (<font color='red'><b>Ares</b></font>)</div>Ares bellowed. ``Be gone.'''
He (<font color='blue'><b>kid</b></font>) swept his (<font color='blue'><b>kid</b></font>) hand, and a wall of red flame rolled across the patrol cars. The police barely had
time to dive for cover before their vehicles exploded. The crowd behind them scattered, screaming.
Ares roared with laughter. ``Now, little hero. Let's add you to the barbecue.''
He (<font color='blue'><b>humans</b></font>) slashed. I deflected his (<font color='blue'><b>humans</b></font>) blade. I got close enough to strike, tried to fake him (<font color='blue'><b>humans</b></font>) out with a feint,
but my blow was knocked aside. The waves were hitting me in the back now. Ares was up to his (<font color='blue'><b>humans</b></font>)
thighs, wading in after me.
I felt the rhythm of the sea, the waves growing larger as the tide rolled in, and suddenly I had an
idea. Little waves, I thought. And the water behind me seemed to recede. I was holding back the tide
by force of will, but tension was building, like carbonation behind a cork.
Ares came toward, grinning confidently. I lowered my blade, as if I were too exhausted to go on.
Wait for it, I told the sea. The pressure now was almost lifting me off my feet. Ares raised his (<font color='blue'><b>Ares</b></font>) sword.
I released the tide and jumped, rocketing straight over Ares on a wave.
A six-foot wall of water smashed him (<font color='blue'><b>Ares</b></font>) full in the face, leaving him (<font color='blue'><b>Ares</b></font>) cursing and sputtering with a
mouth full of seaweed. I landed behind him (<font color='blue'><b>Ares</b></font>) with a splash and feinted toward his (<font color='blue'><b>Ares</b></font>) head, as I'd done
before. He (<font color='blue'><b>Ares</b></font>) turned in time to raise his (<font color='blue'><b>Ares</b></font>) sword, but this time he (<font color='blue'><b>Ares</b></font>) was disoriented, he (<font color='blue'><b>Ares</b></font>) didn't anticipate the
trick. I changed direction, lunged to the side, and stabbed Riptide straight down into the water,
sending the point through the god's heel.
The roar that followed made Hades's earthquake look like a minor event. The very sea was
blasted back from Ares, leaving a wet circle of sand fifty feet wide.
Ichor, the golden blood of the gods, flowed from a gash in the war god's boot. The expression on
his (<font color='blue'><b>god</b></font>) face was beyond hatred. It was pain, shock, complete disbelief that he (<font color='blue'><b>god</b></font>)'d been wounded.
He (<font color='blue'><b>god</b></font>) limped toward me, muttering ancient Greek curses.
Something stopped him (<font color='blue'><b>god</b></font>).
It was as if a cloud covered the sun, but worse. Light faded. Sound and color drained away. A
cold, heavy presence passed over the beach, slowing time, dropping the temperature to freezing, and
making me feel like life was hopeless, fighting was useless.
The darkness lifted.
Ares looked stunned.
Police cars were burning behind us. The crowd of spectators had fled. Annabeth and Grover
stood on the beach, in shock, watching the water flood back around Ares's feet, his (<font color='blue'><b>Grover</b></font>) glowing golden
ichor dissipating in the tide.
Ares lowered his (<font color='blue'><b>Grover</b></font>) sword.
``You have made an enemy, godling,'' he (<font color='blue'><b>Grover</b></font>) told me. ``You have sealed your fate. Every time you
raise your blade in battle, every time you hope for success, you will feel my curse. Beware, Perseus
Jackson. Beware.<div class="bookquote">''
His (<font color='blue'><b>Grover</b></font>) body began to glow.
'''Percy!''  (<font color='red'><b>Annabeth/ANNABETH</b></font>)</div>Annabeth shouted. <div class="bookquote">``Don't watch!''
 (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div>I turned away as the god Ares revealed his (<font color='blue'><b>god</b></font>) true irnmortal form. I somehow knew that if I looked, I
would disintegrate into ashes.
The light died.
I looked back. Ares was gone. The tide rolled out to reveal Hades's bronze helm of darkness. I
picked it up and walked toward my friends.

<p/>But before I got there, I heard the flapping of leathery wings. Three evil-looking grandmothers
with lace hats and fiery whips drifted down from the sky and landed in front of me.
The middle Fury, the one who had been Mrs. Dodds, stepped forward. Her (<font color='blue'><b>Dodds</b></font>) fangs were bared, but
for once she (<font color='blue'><b>Dodds</b></font>) didn't look threatening. She (<font color='blue'><b>Dodds</b></font>) looked more disappointed, as if she (<font color='blue'><b>Dodds</b></font>)'d been planning to have
me for supper, but had decided I might give her (<font color='blue'><b>Dodds</b></font>) indigestion.
<div class="bookquote">``We saw the whole thing,''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Dodds</b></font>) hissed. <div class="bookquote">``So ... it truly was not you?''
 (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div>I tossed her (<font color='blue'><b>Dodds</b></font>) the helmet, which she (<font color='blue'><b>Dodds</b></font>) caught in surprise.
<div class="bookquote">``Return that to Lord Hades,''  (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div>I said. <div class="bookquote">``Tell him (<font color='blue'><b>Lord</b></font>) the truth. Tell him (<font color='blue'><b>Lord</b></font>) to call off the war.''
 (<font color='red'><b>She</b></font>)</div>She (<font color='blue'><b>Dodds</b></font>) hesitated, then ran a forked tongue over her (<font color='blue'><b>Dodds</b></font>) green, leathery lips. <div class="bookquote">``Live well, Percy Jackson.
Become a true hero. Because if you do not, if you ever come into my clutches again ...''
 (<font color='red'><b>She</b></font>)</div>She (<font color='blue'><b>Dodds</b></font>) cackled, savoring the idea. Then she (<font color='blue'><b>Dodds</b></font>) and her (<font color='blue'><b>Dodds</b></font>) sisters rose on their bats' wings, fluttered into
the smoke-filled sky, and disappeared.
I joined Grover and Annabeth, who were staring at me in amazement.
<div class="bookquote">``Percy ...''  (<font color='red'><b>Grover/Grover Underwood/GROVER</b></font>)</div>Grover said. <div class="bookquote">``That was so incredibly ...''
 (<font color='red'><b>Annabeth/ANNABETH</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``Terrifying,''  (<font color='red'><b>Annabeth/ANNABETH</b></font>)</div>said Annabeth.
<div class="bookquote">``Cool!''  (<font color='red'><b>Grover/Grover Underwood/GROVER</b></font>)</div>Grover corrected.
I didn't feel terrified. I certainly didn't feel cool. I was tired and sore and completely drained of
energy.
<div class="bookquote">``Did you guys feel that... whatever it was?''  (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div>I asked.
They both nodded uneasily.
<div class="bookquote">``Must've been the Furies overhead,''  (<font color='red'><b>Grover/Grover Underwood/GROVER</b></font>)</div>Grover said.
But I wasn't so sure. Something had stopped Ares from killing me, and whatever could do that
was a lot stronger than the Furies.
I looked at Annabeth, and an understanding passed between us. I knew now what was in that pit,
what had spoken from the entrance of Tartarus.
I reclaimed my backpack from Grover and looked inside. The master bolt was still there. Such a
small thing to almost cause World War III.
<div class="bookquote">``We have to get back to New York,''  (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div>I said. <div class="bookquote">``By tonight.''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``That's impossible,''  (<font color='red'><b>Annabeth/ANNABETH</b></font>)</div>Annabeth said, ``unless we-``
<div class="bookquote">``Fly,''  (<font color='red'><b>Annabeth/ANNABETH</b></font>)</div>I agreed.
She (<font color='blue'><b>I</b></font>) stared at me. <div class="bookquote">``Fly, like, in an airplane, which you were warned never to do lest Zeus strike
you out of the sky, and carrying a weapon that has more destructive power than a nuclear bomb?''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``Yeah,''  (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div>I said. <div class="bookquote">``Pretty much exactly like that. Come on.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Percy/Percy Jackson/Jackson</b></font>)</div><p/>Percy Jackson 1 - The Lightning Thief
21 I SETTLE
MY TAB
It's funny how humans can wrap their mind around things and fit them into their version of reality.
Chiron had told me that long ago. As usual, I didn't appreciate his (<font color='blue'><b>Jackson</b></font>) wisdom until much later.
According to the L.A. news, the explosion at the Santa Monica beach had been caused when a
crazy kidnapper fired a shotgun at a police car. He (<font color='blue'><b>kidnapper</b></font>) accidentally hit a gas main that had ruptured
during the earthquake.
This crazy kidnapper -LRB-a.k.a. Ares-RRB- was the same man who had abducted me and two other
adolescents in New York and brought us across country on a ten-day odyssey of terror.
Poor little Percy Jackson wasn't an international criminal after all. He (<font color='blue'><b>Jackson</b></font>)'d caused a commotion on
that Greyhound bus in New Jersey trying to get away from his (<font color='blue'><b>Jackson</b></font>) captor -LRB-and afterward, witnesses would
even swear they had seen the leather-clad man on the bus-<div class="bookquote">``Why didn't I remember him (<font color='blue'><b>Zeus</b></font>) before?'' (<font color='red'><b>the man</b></font>)</div>-RRB-. The
crazy man had caused the explosion in the St. Louis Arch. After all, no kid could've done that. A
concerned waitress in Denver had seen the man threatening his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) abductees outside her (<font color='blue'><b>waitress</b></font>) diner, gotten a
friend to take a photo, and notified the police. Finally, brave Percy Jackson -LRB-I was beginning to like
this kid-RRB- had stolen a gun from his (<font color='blue'><b>Jackson</b></font>) captor in Los Angeles and battled him (<font color='blue'><b>Jackson</b></font>) shotgun-to-rifle on the
beach. Police had arrived just in time. But in the spectacular explosion, five police cars had been
destroyed and the captor had fled. No fatalities had occurred. Percy Jackson and his (<font color='blue'><b>Jackson</b></font>) two friends were
safely in police custody.
The reporters fed us this whole story. We just nodded and acted tearful and exhausted -LRB-which
wasn't hard-RRB-, and played victimized kids for the cameras.
<div class="bookquote">``All I want,''  (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div>I said, choking back my tears, <div class="bookquote">``is to see my loving stepfather again. Every time I
saw him (<font color='blue'><b>stepfather</b></font>) on TV, calling me a delinquent punk, I knew ... somehow ... we would be okay. And I know
he (<font color='blue'><b>stepfather</b></font>)'ll want to reward each and every person in this beautiful city of Los Angeles with a free major
appliance from his (<font color='blue'><b>stepfather</b></font>) store. Here's the phone number.''  (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div>The police and reporters were so moved that
they passed around the hat and raised money for three tickets on the next plane to New York.
I knew there was no choice but to fly. I hoped Zeus would cut me some slack, considering the
circumstances. But it was still hard to force myself on board the flight.
Takeoff was a nightmare. Every spot of turbulence was scarier than a Greek monster. I didn't
unclench my hands from the armrests until we touched down safely at La Guardia. The local press
was waiting for us outside security, but we managed to evade them thanks to Annabeth, who lured
them away in her (<font color='blue'><b>it</b></font>) invisible Yankees cap, shouting, <div class="bookquote">``They're over by the frozen yogurt! Come on!''
 (<font color='red'><b>Yankees</b></font>)</div>then rejoined us at baggage claim.
We split up at the taxi stand. I told Annabeth and Grover to get back to Half-Blood Hill and let
Chiron know what had happened. They protested, and it was hard to let them go after all we'd been
through, but I knew I had to do this last part of the quest by myself. If things went wrong, if the gods
didn't believe me ... I wanted Annabeth and Grover to survive to tell Chiron the truth.
I hopped in a taxi and headed into Manhattan.
Thirty minutes later, I walked into the lobby of the Empire State Building.
I must have looked like a homeless kid, with my tattered clothes and my scraped-up face. I hadn't

<p/>slept in at least twenty-four hours.
I went up to the guard at the front desk and said, <div class="bookquote">``Six hundredth floor.''
 (<font color='red'><b>the guard</b></font>)</div>He (<font color='blue'><b>guard</b></font>) was reading a huge book with a picture of a wizard on the front. I wasn't much into fantasy,
but the book must've been good, because the guard took a while to look up. <div class="bookquote">``No such floor, kiddo.''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``I need an audience with Zeus.''
 (<font color='red'><b>He</b></font>)</div>He (<font color='blue'><b>guard</b></font>) gave me a vacant smile. <div class="bookquote">``Sorry?''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``You heard me.''
 (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div>I was about to decide this guy was just a regular mortal, and I'd better run for it before he (<font color='blue'><b>guard</b></font>) called
the straitjacket patrol, when he (<font color='blue'><b>guard</b></font>) said, <div class="bookquote">``No appointment, no audience, kiddo. Lord Zeus doesn't see
anyone unannounced.''
 (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``Oh, I think he (<font color='blue'><b>Zeus</b></font>)'ll make an exception.''  (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div>I slipped off my backpack and unzipped the top.
The guard looked inside at the metal cylinder, not getting what it was for a few seconds. Then his (<font color='blue'><b>guard</b></font>)
face went pale. <div class="bookquote">``That isn't...''
 (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``Yes, it is,''  (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div>I promised. ``You want me take it out and-``
<div class="bookquote">``No! No!''  (<font color='red'><b>He</b></font>)</div>He (<font color='blue'><b>guard</b></font>) scrambled out of his (<font color='blue'><b>guard</b></font>) seat, fumbled around his (<font color='blue'><b>guard</b></font>) desk for a key card, then handed it to
me. <div class="bookquote">``Insert this in the security slot. Make sure nobody else is in the elevator with you.''
 (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div>I did as he (<font color='blue'><b>guard</b></font>) told me. As soon as the elevator doors closed, I slipped the key into the slot. The card
disappeared and a new button appeared on the console, a red one that said 600.
I pressed it and waited, and waited.
Muzak played. <div class="bookquote">``Raindrops keep falling on my head....''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>Finally, ding. The doors slid open. I stepped out and almost had a heart attack.
I was standing on a narrow stone walkway in the middle of the air. Below me was Manhattan,
from the height of an airplane. In front of me, white marble steps wound up the spine of a cloud, into
the sky. My eyes followed the stairway to its end, where my brain just could not accept what I saw.
Look again, my brain said.
We're looking, my eyes insisted. It's really there.
From the top of the clouds rose the decapitated peak of a mountain, its summit covered with snow.
Clinging to the mountainside were dozens of multileveled palaces-a city of mansions-all with whitecolumned porticos, gilded terraces, and bronze braziers glowing with a thousand fires. Roads wound
crazily up to the peak, where the largest palace gleamed against the snow. Precariously perched
gardens bloomed with olive trees and rosebushes. I could make out an open-air market filled with
colorful tents, a stone amphitheater built on one side of the mountain, a hippodrome and a coliseum on
the other. It was an Ancient Greek city, except it wasn't in ruins. It was new, and clean, and colorful,
the way Athens must've looked twenty-five hundred years ago.
This place can't be here, I told myself. The tip of a mountain hanging over New York City like a
billion-ton asteroid? How could something like that be anchored above the Empire State Building, in
plain sight of millions of people, and not get noticed?
But here it was. And here I was.
My trip through Olympus was a daze. I passed some giggling wood nymphs who threw olives at
me from their garden. Hawkers in the market offered to sell me ambrosia-on-a-stick, and a new
shield, and a genuine glitter-weave replica of the Golden Fleece, as seen on Hephaestus-TV The nine
muses were tuning their instruments for a concert in the park while a small crowd gathered-satyrs and
naiads and a bunch of good-looking teenagers who might've been minor gods and goddesses. Nobody
seemed worried about an impending civil war. In fact, everybody seemed in a festive mood. Several
of them turned to watch me pass, and whispered to themselves.

<p/>I climbed the main road, toward the big palace at the peak. It was a reverse copy of the palace in
the Underworld.
There, everything had been black and bronze. Here, everything glittered white and silver.
I realized Hades must've built his (<font color='blue'><b>teenagers</b></font>) palace to resemble this one. He (<font color='blue'><b>teenagers</b></font>) wasn't welcomed in Olympus
except on the winter solstice, so he (<font color='blue'><b>teenagers</b></font>)'d built his (<font color='blue'><b>teenagers</b></font>) own Olympus underground. Despite my bad experience
with him (<font color='blue'><b>teenagers</b></font>), I felt a little sorry for the guy. To be banished from this place seemed really unfair. It would
make anybody bitter.
Steps led up to a central courtyard. Past that, the throne loom.
Room really isn't the right word. The place made Grand Central Station look like a broom closet.
Massive columns rose to a domed ceiling, which was gilded with moving constellations.
Twelve thrones, built for beings the size of Hades, were arranged in an inverted U, just like the
cabins at Camp Half-Blood. An enormous fire crackled in the central hearth pit. The thrones were
empty except for two at the end: the head throne on the right, and the one to its immediate left. I didn't
have to be told who the two gods were that were sitting there, waiting for me to approach. I came
toward them, my legs trembling.
The gods were in giant human form, as Hades had been, but I could barely look at them without
feeling a tingle, as if my body were starting to burn. Zeus, the Lord of the Gods, wore a dark blue
pinstriped suit. He (<font color='blue'><b>Zeus</b></font>) sat on a simple throne of solid platinum. He (<font color='blue'><b>Zeus</b></font>) had a well-trimmed beard, marbled
gray and black like a storm cloud. His (<font color='blue'><b>Zeus</b></font>) face was proud and handsome and grim, his (<font color='blue'><b>Zeus</b></font>) eyes rainy gray.
As I got nearer to him (<font color='blue'><b>Zeus</b></font>), the air crackled and smelled of ozone.
The god sitting next to him (<font color='blue'><b>god</b></font>) was his (<font color='blue'><b>god</b></font>) brother, without a doubt, but he (<font color='blue'><b>god</b></font>) was dressed very differently.
He (<font color='blue'><b>god</b></font>) reminded me of a beachcomber from Key West. He (<font color='blue'><b>god</b></font>) wore leather sandals, khaki Bermuda shorts,
and a Tommy Bahama shirt with coconuts and parrots all over it. His (<font color='blue'><b>Tommy</b></font>) skin was deeply tanned, his (<font color='blue'><b>Tommy</b></font>)
hands scarred like an old-time fisherman's. His (<font color='blue'><b>Tommy</b></font>) hair was black, like mine. His (<font color='blue'><b>Tommy</b></font>) face had that same
brooding look that had always gotten me branded a rebel. But his (<font color='blue'><b>Tommy</b></font>) eyes, seagreen like mine, were
surrounded by sun-crinkles that told me he (<font color='blue'><b>Tommy</b></font>) smiled a lot, too.
His (<font color='blue'><b>Tommy</b></font>) throne was a deep-sea fisherman's chair. It was the simple swiveling kind, with a black
leather seat and a built-in holster for a fishing pole. Instead of a pole, the holster held a bronze
trident, flickering with green light around the tips.
The gods weren't moving or speaking, but there was tension in the air, as if they'd just finished an
argument.
I approached the fisherman's throne and knelt at his (<font color='blue'><b>fisherman</b></font>) feet. <div class="bookquote">``Father.''  (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div>I dared not look up. My heart
was racing. I could feel the energy emanating from the two gods. If I said the wrong thing, I had no
doubt they could blast me into dust.
To my left, Zeus spoke. <div class="bookquote">``Should you not address the master of this house first, boy?''
 (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div>I kept my head down, and waited.
<div class="bookquote">``Peace, brother,''  (<font color='red'><b>Poseidon</b></font>)</div>Poseidon finally said. His (<font color='blue'><b>Zeus</b></font>) voice stirred my oldest memories: that warm glow I
remembered as a baby, the sensation of this god's hand on my forehead, <div class="bookquote">``The boy defers to his (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>) father.
This is only right.''
 (<font color='red'><b>this god</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``You still claim him (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>) then?''  (<font color='red'><b>Zeus</b></font>)</div>Zeus asked, menacingly. <div class="bookquote">``You claim this child whom you sired
against our sacred oath?''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``I have admitted my wrongdoing,''  (<font color='red'><b>Poseidon</b></font>)</div>Poseidon said. <div class="bookquote">``Now I would hear him (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>) speak.''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>Wrongdoing.
A lump welled up in my throat. Was that all I was? A wrongdoing? The result of a god's mistake?
<div class="bookquote">``I have spared him (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>) once already,''  (<font color='red'><b>Zeus</b></font>)</div>Zeus grumbled. ``Daring to fly through my domain ... pah! I

<p/>should have blasted him (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>) out of the sky for his (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>) impudence.''
``And risk destroying your own master bolt?'' Poseidon asked calmly. ``Let us hear him (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>) out,
brother.''
Zeus grumbled some more. ``I shall listen,'' he (<font color='blue'><b>Zeus</b></font>) decided. ``Then I shall make up my mind whether or
not to cast this boy down from Olympus.''
``Perseus,'' Poseidon said. ``Look at me.''
I did, and I wasn't sure what I saw in his (<font color='blue'><b>Zeus</b></font>) face. There was no clear sign of love or approval.
Nothing to encourage me. It was like looking at the ocean: some days, you could tell what mood it
was in. Most days, though, it was unreadable, mysterious.
I got the feeling Poseidon really didn't know what to think of me. He (<font color='blue'><b>Zeus</b></font>) didn't know whether he (<font color='blue'><b>Zeus</b></font>) was
happy to have me as a son or not. In a strange way, I was glad that Poseidon was so distant. If he (<font color='blue'><b>Zeus</b></font>)'d
tried to apologize, or told me he (<font color='blue'><b>Zeus</b></font>) loved me, or even smiled, it would've felt fake. Like a human dad,
making some lame excuse for not being around. I could live with that. After all, I wasn't sure about
him (<font color='blue'><b>dad</b></font>) yet, either.
``Address Lord Zeus, boy,'' Poseidon told me. ``Tell him (<font color='blue'><b>Zeus</b></font>) your story.''
So I told Zeus everything, just as it had happened. I took out the metal cylinder, which began
sparking in the Sky God's presence, and laid it at his (<font color='blue'><b>God</b></font>) feet.
There was a long silence, broken only by the crackle of the hearth fire.
Zeus opened his (<font color='blue'><b>Zeus</b></font>) palm. The lightning bolt flew into it. As he (<font color='blue'><b>Zeus</b></font>) closed his (<font color='blue'><b>Zeus</b></font>) fist, the metallic points
flared with electricity, until he (<font color='blue'><b>Zeus</b></font>) was holding what looked more like the classic thunderbolt, a twentyfoot javelin of arcing, hissing energy that made the hairs on my scalp rise.
``I sense the boy tells the truth,'' Zeus muttered. ``But that Ares would do such a thing ... it is most
unlike him (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>).''
``He (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>) is proud and impulsive,'' Poseidon said. ``It runs in the family.''
``Lord?'' I asked.
They both said, ``Yes?''
``Ares didn't act alone. Someone else-something else- came up with the idea.''
I described my dreams, and the feeling I'd had on the beach, that momentary breath of evil that
had seemed to stop the world, and made Ares back off from killing me.
``In the dreams,'' I said, ``the voice told me to bring the bolt to the Underworld. Ares hinted that
he (<font color='blue'><b>Lord</b></font>)'d been having dreams, too. I think he (<font color='blue'><b>Lord</b></font>) was being used, just as I was, to start a war.''
``You are accusing Hades, after all?'' Zeus asked.
``No,'' I said. ``I mean, Lord Zeus, I've been in the presence of Hades. This feeling on the beach
was different. It was the same thing I felt when I got close to that pit. That was the entrance to
Tartarus, wasn't it? Something powerful and evil is stirring down there ... something even older than
the gods.''
Poseidon and Zeus looked at each other. They had a quick, intense discussion in Ancient Greek. I
only caught one word. Father.
Poseidon made some kind of suggestion, but Zeus cut him (<font color='blue'><b>Zeus</b></font>) off. Poseidon tried to argue. Zeus held
up his (<font color='blue'><b>Zeus</b></font>) hand angrily. ``We will speak of this no more,'' Zeus said. ``I must go personally to purify this
thunderbolt in the waters of Lemnos, to remove the human taint from its metal.''
He (<font color='blue'><b>Zeus</b></font>) rose and looked at me. His (<font color='blue'><b>Zeus</b></font>) expression softened just a fraction of a degree. ``You have done me
a service, boy. Few heroes could have accomplished as much.''
``I had help, sir,'' I said. ``Grover Underwood and Annabeth Chase-``
``To show you my thanks, I shall spare your life. I do not trust you, Perseus Jackson. I do not like

<p/>what your arrival means for the future of Olympus. But for the sake of peace in the family, I shall let
you live.''
``Um ... thank you, sir.''
``Do not presume to fly again. Do not let me find you here when I return. Otherwise you shall taste
this bolt. And it shall be your last sensation.''
Thunder shook the palace. With a blinding flash of lightning, Zeus was gone.
I was alone in the throne room with my father. ``Your uncle,'' Poseidon sighed, ``has always had a
flair for dramatic exits. I think he (<font color='blue'><b>uncle</b></font>) would've done well as the god of theater.''
An uncomfortable silence.
``Sir,'' I said, ``what was in that pit?''
Poseidon regarded me. ``Have you not guessed?''
``Kronos,'' I said. ``The king of the Titans.''
Even in the throne room of Olympus, far away from Tartarus, the name Kronos darkened the
room, made the hearth fire seem not quite so warm on my back.
Poseidon gripped his (<font color='blue'><b>Zeus</b></font>) trident. ``In the First War, Percy, Zeus cut our father Kronos into a thousand
pieces, just as Kronos had done to his (<font color='blue'><b>Zeus</b></font>) own father, Ouranos. Zeus cast Kronos's remains into the
darkest pit of Tartarus. The Titan army was scattered, their mountain fortress on Etna destroyed, their
monstrous allies driven to the farthest corners of the earth. And yet Titans cannot die, any more than
we gods can. Whatever is left of Kronos is still alive in some hideous way, still conscious in his (<font color='blue'><b>Zeus</b></font>)
eternal pain, still hungering for power.''
``He (<font color='blue'><b>Zeus</b></font>)'s healing,'' I said. ``He (<font color='blue'><b>Zeus</b></font>)'s coming back.''
Poseidon shook his (<font color='blue'><b>Zeus</b></font>) head. ``From time to time, over the eons, Kronos has stirred. He (<font color='blue'><b>Zeus</b></font>) enters men's
nightmares and breathes evil thoughts. He (<font color='blue'><b>Zeus</b></font>) wakens restless monsters from the depths. But to suggest he (<font color='blue'><b>Zeus</b></font>)
could rise from the pit is another thing.''
``That's what he (<font color='blue'><b>Zeus</b></font>) intends, Father. That's what he (<font color='blue'><b>Father</b></font>) said.''
Poseidon was silent for a long time.
``Lord Zeus has closed discussion on this matter. He (<font color='blue'><b>Zeus</b></font>) will not allow talk of Kronos. You have
completed your quest, child. That is all you need to do.''
``But-'' I stopped myself. Arguing would do no good. It would very possibly anger the only god
who I had on my side. ``As ... as you wish, Father.''
A faint smile played on his (<font color='blue'><b>god</b></font>) lips. ``Obedience does not come naturally to you, does it?''
``No ... sir.''
``I must take some blame for that, I suppose. The sea does not like to be restrained.'' He (<font color='blue'><b>god</b></font>) rose to his (<font color='blue'><b>god</b></font>)
full height and took up his (<font color='blue'><b>god</b></font>) trident. Then he (<font color='blue'><b>god</b></font>) shimmered and became the size of a regular man, standing
directly in front of me. ``You must go, child. But first, know that your mother has returned.''
I stared at him (<font color='blue'><b>god</b></font>), completely stunned. ``My mother?''
``You will find her (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) at home. Hades sent her (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) when you recovered his (<font color='blue'><b>Father</b></font>) helm. Even the Lord of Death
pays his (<font color='blue'><b>Father</b></font>) debts.''
My heart was pounding. I couldn't believe it. ``Do you ... would you ...''
I wanted to ask if Poseidon would come with me to see her (<font color='blue'><b>god</b></font>), but then I realized that was
ridiculous. I imagined loading the God of the Sea into a taxi and taking him (<font color='blue'><b>God</b></font>) to the Upper East Side. If
he (<font color='blue'><b>God</b></font>)'d wanted to see my mom all these years, he (<font color='blue'><b>God</b></font>) would have. And there was Smelly Gabe to think
about.
Poseidon's eyes took on a little sadness. <div class="bookquote">``When you return home, Percy, you must make an
important choice. You will find a package waiting in your room.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``A package?''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``You will understand when you see it. No one can choose your path, Percy. You must decide.''
 (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div>I nodded, though I didn't know what he (<font color='blue'><b>Gabe</b></font>) meant.
<div class="bookquote">``Your mother is a queen among women,''  (<font color='red'><b>Poseidon</b></font>)</div>Poseidon said wistfully. <div class="bookquote">``I had not met such a mortal
woman in a thousand years. Still ... I am sorry you were born, child. I have brought you a hero's fate,
and a hero's fate is never happy. It is never anything but tragic.''
 (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div>I tried not to feel hurt. Here was my own dad, telling me he (<font color='blue'><b>dad</b></font>) was sorry I'd been born. <div class="bookquote">``I don't
mind, Father.''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``Not yet, perhaps,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>dad</b></font>) said. <div class="bookquote">``Not yet. But it was an unforgivable mistake on my part.''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``I'll leave you then.''  (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div>I bowed awkwardly. <div class="bookquote">``I-I won't bother you again.''
 (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div>I was five steps away when he (<font color='blue'><b>dad</b></font>) called, <div class="bookquote">``Perseus.''
 (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>I turned.
There was a different light in his (<font color='blue'><b>dad</b></font>) eyes, a fiery kind of pride. <div class="bookquote">``You did well, Perseus. Do not
misunderstand me. Whatever else you do, know that you are mine. You are a true son of the Sea
God.''
 (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div>As I walked back through the city of the gods, conversations stopped. The muses paused their
concert. People and satyrs and naiads all turned toward me, their faces filled with respect and
gratitude, and as I passed, they knelt, as if I were some kind of hero.
***
Fifteen minutes later, still in a trance, I was back on the streets of Manhattan.
I caught a taxi to my mom's apartment, rang the doorbell, and there she (<font color='blue'><b>mom</b></font>) was-my beautiful mother,
smelling of peppermint and licorice, the weariness and worry evaporating from her (<font color='blue'><b>mom</b></font>) face as soon as
she (<font color='blue'><b>mom</b></font>) saw me.
<div class="bookquote">``Percy! Oh, thank goodness. Oh, my baby.''
 (<font color='red'><b>She</b></font>)</div>She (<font color='blue'><b>mom</b></font>) crushed the air right out of me. We stood in the hallway as she (<font color='blue'><b>mom</b></font>) cried and ran her (<font color='blue'><b>mom</b></font>) hands
through my hair.
I'll admit it-my eyes were a little misty, too. I was shaking, I was so relieved to see her (<font color='blue'><b>mom</b></font>).
She (<font color='blue'><b>mom</b></font>) told me she (<font color='blue'><b>mom</b></font>)'d just appeared at the apartment that morning, scaring Gabe half out of his (<font color='blue'><b>Gabe</b></font>) wits.
She (<font color='blue'><b>mom</b></font>) didn't remember anything since the Minotaur, and couldn't believe it when Gabe told her (<font color='blue'><b>mom</b></font>) I was a
wanted criminal, traveling across the country, blowing up national monuments. She (<font color='blue'><b>mom</b></font>)'d been going out
of her (<font color='blue'><b>mom</b></font>) mind with worry all day because she (<font color='blue'><b>mom</b></font>) hadn't heard the news. Gabe had forced her (<font color='blue'><b>mom</b></font>) to go into
work, saying she (<font color='blue'><b>mom</b></font>) had a month's salary to make up and she (<font color='blue'><b>mom</b></font>)'d better get started.
I swallowed back my anger and told her (<font color='blue'><b>mom</b></font>) my own story. I tried to make it sound less scary than it
had been, but that wasn't easy. I was just getting to the fight with Ares when Gabe's voice interrupted
from the living room. <div class="bookquote">``Hey, Sally! That meat loaf done yet or what?''
 (<font color='red'><b>She</b></font>)</div>She (<font color='blue'><b>mom</b></font>) closed her (<font color='blue'><b>mom</b></font>) eyes. <div class="bookquote">``He (<font color='blue'><b>Percy</b></font>) isn't going to be happy to see you, Percy. The store got half a million
phone calls today from Los Angeles ... something about free appliances.''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``Oh, yeah. About that...''
 (<font color='red'><b>She</b></font>)</div>She (<font color='blue'><b>mom</b></font>) managed a weak smile. <div class="bookquote">``Just don't make him (<font color='blue'><b>Percy</b></font>) angrier, all right? Come on.''
 (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div>In the month I'd been gone, the apartment had turned into Gabeland. Garbage was ankle deep on
the carpet. The sofa had been reupholstered in beer cans. Dirty socks and underwear hung off the
lampshades.
Gabe and three of his (<font color='blue'><b>Gabe</b></font>) big goony friends were playing poker at the table.
When Gabe saw me, his (<font color='blue'><b>Gabe</b></font>) cigar dropped out of his (<font color='blue'><b>Gabe</b></font>) mouth. His (<font color='blue'><b>Gabe</b></font>) face got redder than lava. ``You got
nerve coming here, you little punk. I thought the police-``

<p/><div class="bookquote">``He (<font color='blue'><b>Percy</b></font>)'s not a fugitive after all,''  (<font color='red'><b>mom</b></font>)</div>my mom interjected. <div class="bookquote">``Isn't that wonderful, Gabe?''
 (<font color='red'><b>Gabe/Gabe Ugliano</b></font>)</div>Gabe looked back and forth between us. He (<font color='blue'><b>Gabe</b></font>) didn't seem to think my homecoming was so
wonderful.
<div class="bookquote">``Bad enough I had to give back your life insurance money, Sally,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Gabe</b></font>) growled. <div class="bookquote">``Get me the phone.
I'll call the cops.''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``Gabe, no!''
 (<font color='red'><b>He</b></font>)</div>He (<font color='blue'><b>Gabe</b></font>) raised his (<font color='blue'><b>Gabe</b></font>) eyebrows. <div class="bookquote">``Did you just say `no'? You think I'm gonna put up with this punk again?
I can still press charges against him (<font color='blue'><b>Gabe</b></font>) for ruining my Camaro.''
 (<font color='red'><b>He</b></font>)</div>``But-``
He (<font color='blue'><b>Gabe</b></font>) raised his (<font color='blue'><b>Gabe</b></font>) hand, and my mother flinched.
For the first time, I realized something. Gabe had hit my mother. I didn't know when, or how
much. But I was sure he (<font color='blue'><b>Gabe</b></font>)'d done it. Maybe it had been going on for years, when I wasn't around.
A balloon of anger started expanding in my chest. I came toward Gabe, instinctively taking my
pen out of my pocket.
He (<font color='blue'><b>Gabe</b></font>) just laughed. <div class="bookquote">``What, punk? You gonna write on me? You touch me, and you are going to jail
forever, you understand?''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``Hey, Gabe,''  (<font color='red'><b>friend</b></font>)</div>his (<font color='blue'><b>Gabe</b></font>) friend Eddie interrupted. <div class="bookquote">``He (<font color='blue'><b>Gabe</b></font>)'s just a kid.''
 (<font color='red'><b>Gabe/Gabe Ugliano</b></font>)</div>Gabe looked at him (<font color='blue'><b>Gabe</b></font>) resentfully and mimicked in a falsetto voice: <div class="bookquote">``Just a kid.''
 (<font color='red'><b>him</b></font>)</div>His (<font color='blue'><b>Gabe</b></font>) other friends laughed like idiots.
<div class="bookquote">``I'll be nice to you, punk.''  (<font color='red'><b>Gabe/Gabe Ugliano</b></font>)</div>Gabe showed me his (<font color='blue'><b>Gabe</b></font>) tobacco-stained teeth. <div class="bookquote">``I'll give you five minutes
to get your stuff and clear out. After that, I call the police.''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``Gabe!''  (<font color='red'><b>mother</b></font>)</div>my mother pleaded.
<div class="bookquote">``He (<font color='blue'><b>Gabe</b></font>) ran away,''  (<font color='red'><b>Gabe/Gabe Ugliano</b></font>)</div>Gabe told her (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>). <div class="bookquote">``Let him (<font color='blue'><b>Gabe</b></font>) stay gone.''
 (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div>I was itching to uncap Riptide, but even if I did, the blade wouldn't hurt humans. And Gabe, by
the loosest definition, was human.
My mother took my arm. <div class="bookquote">``Please, Percy. Come on. We'll go to your room.''
 (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div>I let her (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) pull me away, my hands still trembling with rage.
My room had been completely filled with Gabe's junk. I here were stacks of used car batteries, a
rotting bouquet of sympathy flowers with a card from somebody who'd seen his (<font color='blue'><b>Gabe</b></font>) Barbara Walters
interview.
<div class="bookquote">``Gabe is just upset, honey,''  (<font color='red'><b>mother</b></font>)</div>my mother told me. <div class="bookquote">``I'll talk to him (<font color='blue'><b>Gabe</b></font>) later. I'm sure it will work out.''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``Mom, it'll never work out. Not as long as Gabe's here.''
 (<font color='red'><b>She</b></font>)</div>She (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) wrung her (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) hands nervously. ``I can ... I'll take you to work with me for the rest of the summer.
In the fall, maybe there's another boarding school-``
<div class="bookquote">``Mom.''
 (<font color='red'><b>She</b></font>)</div>She (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) lowered her (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) eyes. <div class="bookquote">``I'm trying, Percy. I just... I need some time.''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>A package appeared on my bed. At least, I could've sworn it hadn't been there a moment before.
It was a battered cardboard box about the right size to fit a basketball. The address on the mailing
slip was in my own handwriting:
The Gods
Mount Olympus
600th Floor,
Empire State Building
New York, NY
With best wishes,

<p/>PERCY JACKSON
Over the top in black marker, in a man's clear, bold print, was the address of our apartment, and
the words: RETURN TO SENDER.
Suddenly I understood what Poseidon had told me on Olympus.
A package. A decision.
Whatever else you do, know that you are mine. You are a true son of the Sea God.
I looked at my mother. ``Mom, do you want Gabe gone?
``Percy, it isn't that simple. I-``
``Mom, just tell me. That jerk has been hitting you. Do you want him (<font color='blue'><b>jerk</b></font>) gone or not?''
She (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) hesitated, then nodded almost imperceptibly. ``Yes, Percy. I do. And I'm trying to get up my
courage to tell him (<font color='blue'><b>Percy</b></font>). But you can't do this for me. You can't solve my problems.''
I looked at the box.
I could solve her (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) problem. I wanted to slice that package open, plop it on the poker table, and take
out what was inside. I could start my very own statue garden, right there in the living room.
That's what a Greek hero would do in the stories, I thought. That's what Gabe deserves.
But a hero's story always ended in tragedy. Poseidon had told me that.
I remembered the Underworld. I thought about Gabe's spirit drifting forever in the Fields of
Asphodel, or condemned to some hideous torture behind the barbed wire of the Fields of Punishmentan eternal poker game, sitting up to his (<font color='blue'><b>Gabe</b></font>) waist in boiling oil listening to opera music. Did I have the
right to send someone there? Even Gabe?
A month ago, I wouldn't have hesitated. Now ...
``I can do it,'' I told my mom. ``One look inside this box, and he (<font color='blue'><b>Percy</b></font>)'ll never bother you again.''
She (<font color='blue'><b>mom</b></font>) glanced at the package, and seemed to understand immediately. ``No, Percy,'' she (<font color='blue'><b>mom</b></font>) said,
stepping away. ``You can't.''
``Poseidon called you a queen,'' I told her (<font color='blue'><b>mom</b></font>). ``He (<font color='blue'><b>Percy</b></font>) said he (<font color='blue'><b>Percy</b></font>) hadn't met a woman like you in a thousand
years.''
Her (<font color='blue'><b>mom</b></font>) cheeks flushed. ``Percy-``
``You deserve better than this, Mom. You should go to college, get your degree. You can write
your novel, meet a nice guy maybe, live in a nice house. You don't need to protect me anymore by
staying with Gabe. Let me get rid of him (<font color='blue'><b>Gabe</b></font>).''
She (<font color='blue'><b>mom</b></font>) wiped a tear off her (<font color='blue'><b>mom</b></font>) cheek. ``You sound so much like your father,'' she (<font color='blue'><b>mom</b></font>) said. ``He (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) offered to
stop the tide for me once. He (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) offered to build me a palace at the bottom of the sea. He (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) thought he (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>)
could solve all my problems with a wave of his (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) hand.''
``What's wrong with that?''
Her (<font color='blue'><b>mom</b></font>) multicolored eyes seemed to search inside me. ``I think you know, Percy. I think you're
enough like me to understand. If my life is going to mean anything, I have to live it myself. I can't let a
god take care of me ... or my son. I have to ... find the courage on my own. Your quest has reminded
me of that.''
We listened to the sound of poker chips and swearing, ESPN from the living room television.
``I'll leave the box,'' I said. ``If he (<font color='blue'><b>son</b></font>) threatens you ...''
She (<font color='blue'><b>mom</b></font>) looked pale, but she (<font color='blue'><b>mom</b></font>) nodded. ``Where will you go, Percy?''
``Half-Blood Hill.''
``For the summer ... or forever?''
<div class="bookquote">``I guess that depends.''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>We locked eyes, and I sensed that we had an agreement. We would see how things stood at the

<p/>end of the summer.
She (<font color='blue'><b>mom</b></font>) kissed my forehead. <div class="bookquote">``You'll be a hero, Percy. You'll be the greatest of all.''
 (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div>I took one last look around my bedroom. I had a feeling I'd never see it again. Then I walked with
my mother to the front door.
<div class="bookquote">``Leaving so soon, punk?''  (<font color='red'><b>Gabe/Gabe Ugliano</b></font>)</div>Gabe called after me. <div class="bookquote">``Good riddance.''
 (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div>I had one last twinge of doubt. How could I turn down the perfect chance to take revenge on him (<font color='blue'><b>Gabe</b></font>)?
I was leaving here without saving my mother.
<div class="bookquote">``Hey, Sally,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Gabe</b></font>) yelled. <div class="bookquote">``What about that meat loaf, huh?''
 (<font color='red'><b>mother</b></font>)</div>A steely look of anger flared in my mother's eyes, and I thought, just maybe, I was leaving her (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) in
good hands after all. Her (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) own.
<div class="bookquote">``The meat loaf is coming right up, dear,''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) told Gabe. <div class="bookquote">``Meat loaf surprise.''
 (<font color='red'><b>She</b></font>)</div>She (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) looked at me, and winked.
The last thing I saw as the door swung closed was my mother staring at Gabe, as if she (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) were
contemplating how he (<font color='blue'><b>Gabe</b></font>) would look as a garden statue.

<p/>Percy Jackson 1 - The Lightning Thief
22 THE PROPHECY
COMES TRUE
We were the first heroes to return alive to Half-Blood Hill since Luke, so of course everybody
treated us as if we'd won some reality-TV contest. According to camp tradition, we wore laurel
wreaths to a big feast prepared in our honor, then led a procession down to the bonfire, where we got
to burn the burial shrouds our cabins had made for us in our absence.
Annabeth's shroud was so beautiful-gray silk with embroidered owls-I told her (<font color='blue'><b>our</b></font>) it seemed a shame
not to bury her (<font color='blue'><b>our</b></font>) in it. She (<font color='blue'><b>our</b></font>) punched me and told me to shut up.
Being the son of Poseidon, I didn't have any cabin mates, so the Ares cabin had volunteered to
make my shroud. They'd taken an old bedsheet and painted smiley faces with X’ed-out eyes around
the border, and the word LOSER painted really big in the middle.
It was fun to burn.
As Apollo's cabin led the sing-along and passed out s'mores, I was surrounded by my old
Hermes cabinmates, Annabeth's friends from Athena, and Grover's satyr buddies, who were
admiring the brand-new searcher's license he (<font color='blue'><b>Grover</b></font>)'d received from the Council of Cloven Elders. The
council had called Grover's performance on the quest <div class="bookquote">``Brave to the point of indigestion. Horns-andwhiskers above anything we have seen in the past.''
 (<font color='red'><b>Grover/Grover Underwood/GROVER</b></font>)</div>The only ones not in a party mood were Clarisse and her (<font color='blue'><b>Clarisse</b></font>) cabinmates, whose poisonous looks told
me they'd never forgive me for disgracing their dad.
That was okay with me.
Even Dionysus's welcome-home speech wasn't enough to dampen my spirits. <div class="bookquote">``Yes, yes, so the
little brat didn't get himself killed and now he (<font color='blue'><b>brat</b></font>)'ll have an even bigger head. Well, huzzah for that. In
other announcements, there will be no canoe races this Saturday....''
 (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div>I moved back into cabin three, but it didn't feel so lonely anymore. I had my friends to train with
during the day. At night, I lay awake and listened to the sea, knowing my father was out there. Maybe
he (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) wasn't quite sure about me yet, maybe he (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) hadn't even wanted me born, but he (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) was watching. And
so far, he (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) was proud of what I'd done.
As for my mother, she (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) had a chance at a new life. Her (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) letter arrived a week after I got back to
camp. She (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) told me Gabe had left mysteriously-disappeared off the face of the planet, in fact. She (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>)'d
reported him (<font color='blue'><b>Gabe</b></font>) missing to the police, but she (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) had a funny feeling they would never find him (<font color='blue'><b>Gabe</b></font>).
On a completely unrelated subject, she (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>)'d sold her (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) first life-size concrete sculpture, entitled The
Poker Player, to a collector, through an art gallery in Soho. She (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>)'d gotten so much money for it, she (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>)'d
put a deposit down on a new apartment and made a payment on her (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) first semester's tuition at NYU.
The Soho gallery was clamoring for more of her (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) work, which they called <div class="bookquote">``a huge step forward in
super-ugly neorealism.''
 (<font color='red'><b>mom</b></font>)</div>But don't worry, my mom wrote. I'm done with sculpture. I've disposed of that box of tools you
left me. It's time for me to turn to writing.
At the bottom, she (<font color='blue'><b>mom</b></font>) wrote a P.S.: Percy, I've found a good private school here in the city. I've put a
deposit down to hold you a spot, in case you want to enroll for seventh grade. You could live at
home. But if you want to go year-round at Half-Blood Hill, I'll understand.

<p/>I folded the note carefully and set it on my bedside table. Every night before I went to sleep, I
read it again, and I tried to decide how to answer her (<font color='blue'><b>mom</b></font>).
On the Fourth of July, the whole camp gathered at the beach for a fireworks display by cabin nine.
Being Hephaestus's kids, they weren't going to settle for a few lame red-white-and-blue explosions.
They'd anchored a barge offshore and loaded it with rockets the size of Patriot missiles. According to
Annabeth, who'd seen the show before, the blasts would be sequenced so tightly they'd look like
frames of animation across the sky. The finale was supposed to be a couple of hundred-foot-tall
Spartan warriors who would crackle to life above the ocean, fight a battle, then explode into a
million colors.
As Annabeth and I were spreading a picnic blanket, Grover showed up to tell us good-bye. He (<font color='blue'><b>Grover</b></font>)
was dressed in his (<font color='blue'><b>Grover</b></font>) usual jeans and T-shirt and sneakers, but in the last few weeks he (<font color='blue'><b>Grover</b></font>)'d started to look
older, almost high-school age. His (<font color='blue'><b>Grover</b></font>) goatee had gotten thicker. He (<font color='blue'><b>Grover</b></font>)'d put on weight. His (<font color='blue'><b>Grover</b></font>) horns had
grown at least an inch, so he (<font color='blue'><b>Grover</b></font>) now had to wear his (<font color='blue'><b>Grover</b></font>) rasta cap all the time to pass as human.
<div class="bookquote">``I'm off,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Grover</b></font>) said. <div class="bookquote">``I just came to say ... well, you know.''
 (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div>I tried to feel happy for him (<font color='blue'><b>Grover</b></font>). After all, it wasn't every day a satyr got permission to go look for the
great god Pan. But it was hard saying good-bye. I'd only known Grover a year, yet he (<font color='blue'><b>Grover</b></font>) was my oldest
friend.
Annabeth gave him (<font color='blue'><b>Grover</b></font>) a hug. She (<font color='blue'><b>Grover</b></font>) told him (<font color='blue'><b>Grover</b></font>) to keep his (<font color='blue'><b>Grover</b></font>) fake feet on.
I asked him (<font color='blue'><b>Grover</b></font>) where he (<font color='blue'><b>Grover</b></font>) was going to search first.
<div class="bookquote">``Kind of a secret,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Grover</b></font>) said, looking embarrassed. <div class="bookquote">``I wish you could come with me, guys, but
humans and Pan ...''
 (<font color='red'><b>Annabeth/ANNABETH</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``We understand,''  (<font color='red'><b>Annabeth/ANNABETH</b></font>)</div>Annabeth said. <div class="bookquote">``You got enough tin cans for the trip?''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``Yeah.''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``And you remembered your reed pipes?''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``Jeez, Annabeth,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Grover</b></font>) grumbled. <div class="bookquote">``You're like an old mama goat.''
 (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>But he (<font color='blue'><b>Grover</b></font>) didn't really sound annoyed.
He (<font color='blue'><b>Grover</b></font>) gripped his (<font color='blue'><b>Grover</b></font>) walking stick and slung a backpack over his (<font color='blue'><b>Grover</b></font>) shoulder. He (<font color='blue'><b>Grover</b></font>) looked like any
hitchhiker you might see on an American highway-nothing like the little runty boy I used to defend
from bullies at Yancy Academy.
<div class="bookquote">``Well,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Academy</b></font>) said, <div class="bookquote">``wish me luck.''
 (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>He (<font color='blue'><b>Academy</b></font>) gave Annabeth another hug. He (<font color='blue'><b>Academy</b></font>) clapped me on the shoulder, then headed back through the
dunes.
Fireworks exploded to life overhead: Hercules killing the Nemean lion, Artemis chasing the boar,
George Washington -LRB-who, by the way, was a son of Athena-RRB- crossing the Delaware.
<div class="bookquote">``Hey, Grover,''  (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div>I called.
He (<font color='blue'><b>son</b></font>) turned at the edge of the woods.
<div class="bookquote">``Wherever you're going-I hope they make good enchiladas.''
 (<font color='red'><b>Grover/Grover Underwood/GROVER</b></font>)</div>Grover grinned, and then he (<font color='blue'><b>Grover</b></font>) was gone, the trees closing around him (<font color='blue'><b>Grover</b></font>).
<div class="bookquote">``We'll see him (<font color='blue'><b>Grover</b></font>) again,''  (<font color='red'><b>Annabeth/ANNABETH</b></font>)</div>Annabeth said.
I tried to believe it. The fact that no searcher had ever come back in two thousand years ... well, I
decided not to think about that. Grover would be the first. He (<font color='blue'><b>Grover</b></font>) had to be.
July passed.
I spent my days devising new strategies for capture-the-flag and making alliances with the other
cabins to keep the banner out of Ares's hands. I got to the top of the climbing wall for the first time
without getting scorched by lava.

<p/>From time to time, I'd walk past the Big House, glance up at the attic windows, and think about
the Oracle. I tried to convince myself that its prophecy had come to completion.
You shall go west, and face the god who has turned.
Been there, done that-even though the traitor god had turned out to be Ares rather than Hades.
You shall find what was stolen, and see it safe returned.
Check. One master bolt delivered. One helm of darkness back on Hades's oily head.
You shall be betrayed by one who calls you a friend.
This line still bothered me. Ares had pretended to be my friend, then betrayed me. That must be
what the Oracle meant....
And you shall fail to save what matters most, in the end.
I had failed to save my mom, but only because I'd let her (<font color='blue'><b>mom</b></font>) save herself, and I knew that was the
right thing.
So why was I still uneasy?
The last night of the summer session came all too quickly.
The campers had one last meal together. We burned part of our dinner for the gods. At the bonfire,
the senior counselors awarded the end-of-summer beads.
I got my own leather necklace, and when I saw the bead for my first summer, I was glad the
firelight covered my blushing. The design was pitch black, with a sea-green trident shimmering in the
center.
<div class="bookquote">``The choice was unanimous,''  (<font color='red'><b>Luke</b></font>)</div>Luke announced. <div class="bookquote">``This bead commemorates the first Son of the Sea
God at this camp, and the quest he (<font color='blue'><b>God</b></font>) undertook into the darkest part of the Underworld to stop a war!''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>The entire camp got to their feet and cheered. Even Ares's cabin felt obliged to stand. Athena's
cabin steered Annabeth to the front so she (<font color='blue'><b>Athena</b></font>) could share in the applause.
I'm not sure I'd ever felt as happy or sad as I did at that moment. I'd finally found a family,
people who cared about me and thought I'd done something right. And in the morning, most of them
would be leaving for the year.
***
The next morning, I found a form letter on my bedside table.
I knew Dionysus must've filled it out, because he (<font color='blue'><b>I</b></font>) stubbornly insisted on getting my name wrong:
Dear Peter Johnson ,
If you intend to stay at Camp Half-Blood year-round, you must inform the Big House by noon
today. If you do not announce your intentions, we will assume you have vacated your cabin or died a
horrible death. Cleaning harpies will begin work at sundown. They will be authorized to eat any
unregistered campers. All personal articles left behind will be incinerated in the lava pit.
Have a nice day!
Mr. D -LRB-Dionysus-RRB-
Camp Director, Olympian Council #12
That's another thing about ADHD. Deadlines just aren't real to me until I'm staring one in the
face. Summer was over, and I still hadn't answered my mother, or the camp, about whether I'd be
staying. Now I had only a few hours to decide.
The decision should have been easy. I mean, nine months of hero training or nine months of sitting
in a classroom-duh.
But there was my mom to consider. For the first time, I had the chance to live with her (<font color='blue'><b>mom</b></font>) for a whole
year, without Gabe. I had a chance be at home and knock around the city in my free time. I
remembered what Annabeth had said so long ago on our quest: The real world is where the monsters

<p/>are. That's where you learn whether you're any good or not.
I thought about the fate of Thalia, daughter of Zeus. I wondered how many monsters would attack
me if I left Half-Blood Hill. If I stayed in one place for a whole school year, without Chiron or my
friends around to help me, would my mother and I even survive until the next summer? That was
assuming the spelling tests and five-paragraph essays didn't kill me. I decided I'd go down to the
arena and do some sword practice. Maybe that would clear my head.
The campgrounds were mostly deserted, shimmering in the August heat. All the campers were in
their cabins packing up, or running around with brooms and mops, getting ready for final inspection.
Argus was helping some of the Aphrodite kids haul their Gucci suitcases and makeup kits over the
hill, where the camp's shuttle bus would be waiting to take them to the airport.
Don't think about leaving yet, I told myself. Just train.
I got to the sword-fighters arena and found that Luke had had the same idea. His (<font color='blue'><b>Luke</b></font>) gym bag was
plopped at the edge of the stage. He (<font color='blue'><b>Luke</b></font>) was working solo, whaling on battle dummies with a sword I'd
never seen before. It must've been a regular steel blade, because he (<font color='blue'><b>Luke</b></font>) was slashing the dummies' heads
right off, stabbing through their straw-stuffed guts. His (<font color='blue'><b>Luke</b></font>) orange counselor's shirt was dripping with
sweat. His (<font color='blue'><b>Luke</b></font>) expression was so intense, his (<font color='blue'><b>Luke</b></font>) life might've really been in danger. I watched, fascinated,
as he (<font color='blue'><b>Luke</b></font>) disemboweled the whole row of dummies, hacking off limbs and basically reducing them to a
pile of straw and armor.
They were only dummies, but I still couldn't help being awed by Luke's skill. The guy was an
incredible fighter. It made me wonder, again, how he (<font color='blue'><b>guy</b></font>) possibly could've failed at his (<font color='blue'><b>guy</b></font>) quest.
Finally, he (<font color='blue'><b>guy</b></font>) saw me, and stopped mid-swing. <div class="bookquote">``Percy.''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``Um, sorry,''  (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div>I said, embarrassed. ``I just-``
<div class="bookquote">``It's okay,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>guy</b></font>) said, lowering his (<font color='blue'><b>guy</b></font>) sword. <div class="bookquote">``Just doing some last-minute practice.''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``Those dummies won't be bothering anybody anymore.''
 (<font color='red'><b>Luke</b></font>)</div>Luke shrugged. <div class="bookquote">``We build new ones every summer.''
 (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div>Now that his (<font color='blue'><b>Luke</b></font>) sword wasn't swirling around, I could see something odd about it. The blade was
two different types of metal-one edge bronze, the other steel.
Luke noticed me looking at it. <div class="bookquote">``Oh, this? New toy. This is Backbiter.''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``Backbiter?''
 (<font color='red'><b>Luke</b></font>)</div>Luke turned the blade in the light so it glinted wickedly. <div class="bookquote">``One side is celestial bronze. The other
is tempered steel. Works on mortals and immortals both.''
 (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div>I thought about what Chiron had told me when I started my quest-that a hero should never harm
mortals unless absolutely necessary.
<div class="bookquote">``I didn't know they could make weapons like that.''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``They probably can't,''  (<font color='red'><b>Luke</b></font>)</div>Luke agreed. <div class="bookquote">``It's one of a kind.''
 (<font color='red'><b>He</b></font>)</div>He (<font color='blue'><b>Luke</b></font>) gave me a tiny smile, then slid the sword into its scabbard. <div class="bookquote">``Listen, I was going to come
looking for you. What do you say we go down to the woods one last time, look for something to
fight?''
 (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div>I don't know why I hesitated. I should've felt relieved that Luke was being so friendly. Ever since
I'd gotten back from the quest, he (<font color='blue'><b>Luke</b></font>)'d been acting a little distant. I was afraid he (<font color='blue'><b>Luke</b></font>) might resent me for all
the attention I'd gotten.
<div class="bookquote">``You think it's a good idea?''  (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div>I asked. ``I mean-``
<div class="bookquote">``Aw, come on.''  (<font color='red'><b>He</b></font>)</div>He (<font color='blue'><b>Luke</b></font>) rummaged in his (<font color='blue'><b>Luke</b></font>) gym bag and pulled out a six-pack of Cokes. <div class="bookquote">``Drinks are on
me.''
 (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div>I stared at the Cokes, wondering where the heck he (<font color='blue'><b>Luke</b></font>)'d gotten them. There were no regular mortal

<p/>sodas at the camp store. No way to smuggle them in unless you talked to a satyr, maybe.
Of course, the magic dinner goblets would fill with anything you want, but it just didn't taste the
same as a real Coke, straight out of the can.
Sugar and caffeine. My willpower crumbled.
<div class="bookquote">``Sure,''  (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div>I decided. <div class="bookquote">``Why not?''
 (<font color='red'><b>monster</b></font>)</div>We walked down to the woods and kicked around for some kind of monster to fight, but it was too
hot. All the monsters with any sense must've been taking siestas in their nice cool caves.
We found a shady spot by the creek where I'd broken Clarisse's spear during my first capture the
flag game. We sat on a big rock, drank our Cokes, and watched the sunlight in the woods.
After a while Luke said, <div class="bookquote">``You miss being on a quest?''
 (<font color='red'><b>Luke</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``With monsters attacking me every three feet? Are you kidding?''
 (<font color='red'><b>Luke</b></font>)</div>Luke raised an eyebrow.
<div class="bookquote">``Yeah, I miss it,''  (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div>I admitted. <div class="bookquote">``You?''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>A shadow passed over his (<font color='blue'><b>Luke</b></font>) face.
I was used to hearing from the girls how good-looking Luke was, but at the moment, he (<font color='blue'><b>Luke</b></font>) looked
weary, and angry, and not at all handsome. His (<font color='blue'><b>Luke</b></font>) blond hair was gray in the sunlight. The scar on his (<font color='blue'><b>Luke</b></font>)
face looked deeper than usual. I could imagine him (<font color='blue'><b>Luke</b></font>) as an old man.
<div class="bookquote">``I've lived at Half-Blood Hill year-round since I was fourteen,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Luke</b></font>) told me. ``Ever since Thalia
... well, you know. I trained, and trained, and trained. I never got to be a normal teenager, out there in
the real world. Then they threw me one quest, and when I came back, it was like, `Okay, ride's over.
Have a nice life.'''
He (<font color='blue'><b>teenager</b></font>) crumpled his (<font color='blue'><b>teenager</b></font>) Coke can and threw into the creek, which really shocked me. One of the first
things you learn at Camp Half-Blood is: Don't litter. You'll hear from the nymphs and the naiads.
They'll get even. You'll crawl into bed one night and find your sheets filled with centipedes and mud.
``The heck with laurel wreaths,'' Luke said. ``I'm not going to end up like those dusty trophies in
the Big House attic.''
``You make it sound like you're leaving.''
Luke gave me a twisted smile. ``Oh, I'm leaving, all right, Percy. I brought you down here to say
good-bye.''
He (<font color='blue'><b>Luke</b></font>) snapped his (<font color='blue'><b>Luke</b></font>) fingers. A small fire burned a hole in the ground at my feet. Out crawled
something glistening black, about the size of my hand. A scorpion.
I started to go for my pen.
``I wouldn't,'' Luke cautioned. ``Pit scorpions can jump up to fifteen feet. Its stinger can pierce
right through your clothes. You'll be dead in sixty seconds.''
``Luke, what-``
Then it hit me.
You will be betrayed by one who calls you a friend.
``You,'' I said.
He (<font color='blue'><b>Luke</b></font>) stood calmly and brushed off his (<font color='blue'><b>Luke</b></font>) jeans.
The scorpion paid him (<font color='blue'><b>Luke</b></font>) no attention. It kept its beady black eyes on me, clamping its pincers as it
crawled onto my shoe.
``I saw a lot out there in the world, Percy,'' Luke said. <div class="bookquote">``Didn't you feel it-the darkness gathering,
the monsters growing stronger? Didn't you realize how useless it all is? All the heroics-being pawns
of the gods. They should've been overthrown thousands of years ago, but they've hung on, thanks to us
half-bloods.''

 (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div><p/>I couldn't believe this was happening.
<div class="bookquote">``Luke ... you're talking about our parents,''  (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div>I said.
He (<font color='blue'><b>Luke</b></font>) laughed. <div class="bookquote">``That's supposed to make me love them? Their precious `Western civilization is a
disease, Percy. It's killing the world. The only way to stop it is to burn it to the ground, start over
with something more honest.''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``You're as crazy as Ares.''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>His (<font color='blue'><b>Luke</b></font>) eyes flared. <div class="bookquote">``Ares is a fool. He (<font color='blue'><b>fool</b></font>) never realized the true master he (<font color='blue'><b>fool</b></font>) was serving. If I had time,
Percy, I could explain. But I'm afraid you won't live that long.''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>The scorpion crawled onto my pants leg.
There had to be a way out of this. I needed time to think.
<div class="bookquote">``Kronos,''  (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div>I said. <div class="bookquote">``That's who you serve.''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>The air got colder.
<div class="bookquote">``You should be careful with names,''  (<font color='red'><b>Luke</b></font>)</div>Luke warned.
<div class="bookquote">``Kronos got you to steal the master bolt and the helm. He (<font color='blue'><b>master</b></font>) spoke to you in your dreams.''
 (<font color='red'><b>Luke</b></font>)</div>Luke's eye twitched. <div class="bookquote">``He (<font color='blue'><b>master</b></font>) spoke to you, too, Percy. You should've listened.''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``He (<font color='blue'><b>Percy</b></font>)'s brainwashing you, Luke.''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``You're wrong. He (<font color='blue'><b>Luke</b></font>) showed me that my talents are being wasted. You know what my quest was
two years ago, Percy? My father, Hermes, wanted me to steal a golden apple from the Garden of the
Hesperides and return it to Olympus. After all the training I'd done, that was the best he (<font color='blue'><b>Percy</b></font>) could think
up.''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``That's not an easy quest,''  (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div>I said. <div class="bookquote">``Hercules did it.''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``Exactly,''  (<font color='red'><b>Luke</b></font>)</div>Luke said. <div class="bookquote">``Where's the glory in repeating what others have done? All the gods know
how to do is replay their past. My heart wasn't in it. The dragon in the garden gave me this'' (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>-he (<font color='blue'><b>Luke</b></font>)
pointed angrily at his (<font color='blue'><b>Luke</b></font>) scar-<div class="bookquote">``and when I came back, all I got was pity. I wanted to pull Olympus down
stone by stone right then, but I bided my time. I began to dream of Kronos. He (<font color='blue'><b>Hercules</b></font>) convinced me to steal
something worthwhile, something no hero had ever had the courage to take. When we went on that
winter-solstice field trip, while the other campers were asleep, I snuck into the throne room and took
Zeus's master bolt right from his (<font color='blue'><b>Zeus</b></font>) chair. Hades's helm of darkness, too. You wouldn't believe how
easy it was. The Olympians are so arrogant; they never dreamed someone would dare steal from
them. Their security is horrible. I was halfway across New Jersey before I heard the storms rumbling,
and I knew they'd discovered my theft.''
 (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>The scorpion was sitting on my knee now, staring at me with its glittering eyes. I tried to keep my
voice level. <div class="bookquote">``So why didn't you bring the items to Kronos?''
 (<font color='red'><b>Luke</b></font>)</div>Luke's smile wavered. <div class="bookquote">``I ... I got overconfident. Zeus sent out his (<font color='blue'><b>Zeus</b></font>) sons and daughters to find the
stolen bolt- Artemis, Apollo, my father, Hermes. But it was Ares who caught me. I could have beaten
him (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>), but I wasn't careful enough. He (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) disarmed me, took the items of power, threatened to return them
to Olympus and burn me alive. Then Kronos's voice came to me and told me what to say. I put the
idea in Ares's head about a great war between the gods. I said all he (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) had to do was hide the items
away for a while and watch the others fight. Ares got a wicked gleam in his (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) eyes. I knew he (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) was
hooked. He (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) let me go, and I returned to Olympus before anyone noticed my absence.''  (<font color='red'><b>Luke</b></font>)</div>Luke drew his (<font color='blue'><b>Luke</b></font>)
new sword. He (<font color='blue'><b>Luke</b></font>) ran his (<font color='blue'><b>Luke</b></font>) thumb down the flat of the blade, as if he (<font color='blue'><b>Luke</b></font>) were hypnotized by its beauty.
<div class="bookquote">``Afterward, the Lord of the Titans ... h-he punished me with nightmares. I swore not to fail again.
Back at Camp Half-Blood, in my dreams, I was told that a second hero would arrive, one who could
be tricked into taking the bolt and the helm the rest of the way-from Ares down to Tartarus.''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``You summoned the hellhound, that night in the forest.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``We had to make Chiron think the camp wasn't safe for you, so he (<font color='blue'><b>hero</b></font>) would start you on your quest.
We had to confirm his (<font color='blue'><b>hero</b></font>) fears that Hades was after you. And it worked.''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``The flying shoes were cursed,''  (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div>I said. <div class="bookquote">``They were supposed to drag me and the backpack into
Tartarus.''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``And they would have, if you'd been wearing them. But you gave them to the satyr, which wasn't
part of the plan. Grover messes up everything he (<font color='blue'><b>Grover</b></font>) touches. He (<font color='blue'><b>Grover</b></font>) even confused the curse.''
 (<font color='red'><b>Luke</b></font>)</div>Luke looked down at the scorpion, which was now sitting on my thigh. <div class="bookquote">``You should have died in
Tartarus, Percy. But don't worry, I'll leave you with my little friend to set things right.''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``Thalia gave her (<font color='blue'><b>Grover</b></font>) life to save you,''  (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div>I said, gritting my teeth. <div class="bookquote">``And this is how you repay her (<font color='blue'><b>Grover</b></font>)?''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``Don't speak of Thalia!''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Luke</b></font>) shouted. <div class="bookquote">``The gods let her (<font color='blue'><b>Thalia</b></font>) die! That's one of the many things they
will pay for.''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``You're being used, Luke. You and Ares both. Don't listen to Kronos.''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``I've been used?''  (<font color='red'><b>Luke</b></font>)</div>Luke's voice turned shrill. <div class="bookquote">``Look at yourself. What has your dad ever done for
you? Kronos will rise. You've only delayed his (<font color='blue'><b>dad</b></font>) plans. He (<font color='blue'><b>dad</b></font>) will cast the Olympians into Tartarus and
drive humanity back to their caves. All except the strongest-the ones who serve him (<font color='blue'><b>dad</b></font>).''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``Call off the bug,''  (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div>I said. <div class="bookquote">``If you're so strong, fight me yourself''
 (<font color='red'><b>Luke</b></font>)</div>Luke smiled. <div class="bookquote">``Nice try, Percy. But I'm not Ares. You can't bait me. My lord is waiting, and he (<font color='blue'><b>lord</b></font>)'s
got plenty of quests for me to undertake.''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>``Luke-``
<div class="bookquote">``Good-bye, Percy. There is a new Golden Age coming. You won't be part of it.''
 (<font color='red'><b>He</b></font>)</div>He (<font color='blue'><b>Luke</b></font>) slashed his (<font color='blue'><b>Luke</b></font>) sword in an arc and disappeared in a ripple of darkness.
The scorpion lunged.
I swatted it away with my hand and uncapped my sword. The thing jumped at me and I cut it in
half in midair.
I was about to congratulate myself until I looked down at my hand. My palm had a huge red welt,
oozing and smoking with yellow guck. The thing had gotten me after all.
My ears pounded. My vision went foggy. The water, I thought. It healed me before.
I stumbled to the creek and submerged my hand, but nothing seemed to happen. The poison was
too strong. My vision was getting dark. I could barely stand up.
Sixty seconds, Luke had told me.
I had to get back to camp. If I collapsed out here, my body would be dinner for a monster. Nobody
would ever know what had happened.
My legs felt like lead. My forehead was burning. I stumbled toward the camp, and the nymphs
stirred from their trees.
<div class="bookquote">``Help,''  (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div>I croaked. <div class="bookquote">``Please ...''
 (<font color='red'><b>me</b></font>)</div>Two of them took my arms, pulling me along. I remember making it to the clearing, a counselor
shouting for help, a centaur blowing a conch horn.
Then everything went black.
***
I woke with a drinking straw in my mouth. I was sipping something that tasted like liquid
chocolate-chip cookies. Nectar.
I opened my eyes.
I was propped up in bed in the sickroom of the Big House, my right hand bandaged like a club.
Argus stood guard in the corner. Annabeth sat next to me, holding my nectar glass and dabbing a
washcloth on my forehead.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Here we are again,''  (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div>I said.
<div class="bookquote">``You idiot,''  (<font color='red'><b>Annabeth/ANNABETH</b></font>)</div>Annabeth said, which is how I knew she (<font color='blue'><b>my</b></font>) was overjoyed to see me conscious. <div class="bookquote">``You
were green and turning gray when we found you. If it weren't for Chiron's healing ...''
 (<font color='red'><b>Chiron</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``Now, now,''  (<font color='red'><b>Chiron</b></font>)</div>Chiron's voice said. <div class="bookquote">``Percy's constitution deserves some of the credit.''
 (<font color='red'><b>He</b></font>)</div>He (<font color='blue'><b>guard</b></font>) was sitting near the foot of my bed in human form, which was why I hadn't noticed him (<font color='blue'><b>guard</b></font>) yet.
His (<font color='blue'><b>guard</b></font>) lower half was magically compacted into the wheelchair, his (<font color='blue'><b>guard</b></font>) upper half dressed in a coat and tie.
He (<font color='blue'><b>guard</b></font>) smiled, but his (<font color='blue'><b>guard</b></font>) face looked weary and pale, the way it did when he (<font color='blue'><b>guard</b></font>)'d been up all night grading
Latin papers.
<div class="bookquote">``How are you feeling?''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>guard</b></font>) asked.
<div class="bookquote">``Like my insides have been frozen, then microwaved.''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``Apt, considering that was pit scorpion venom. Now you must tell me, if you can, exactly what
happened.''
 (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div>Between sips of nectar, I told them the story.
The room was quiet for a long time.
<div class="bookquote">``I can't believe that Luke ...''  (<font color='red'><b>Annabeth/ANNABETH</b></font>)</div>Annabeth's voice faltered. Her (<font color='blue'><b>guard</b></font>) expression turned angry and sad.
<div class="bookquote">``Yes. Yes, I can believe it. May the gods curse him (<font color='blue'><b>Luke</b></font>).... He (<font color='blue'><b>Luke</b></font>) was never the same after his (<font color='blue'><b>Luke</b></font>) quest.''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``This must be reported to Olympus,''  (<font color='red'><b>Chiron</b></font>)</div>Chiron murmured. <div class="bookquote">``I will go at once.''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``Luke is out there right now,''  (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div>I said. <div class="bookquote">``I have to go after him (<font color='blue'><b>Luke</b></font>).''
 (<font color='red'><b>Chiron</b></font>)</div>Chiron shook his (<font color='blue'><b>guard</b></font>) head. ``No, Percy. The gods-``
<div class="bookquote">``Won't even talk about Kronos,''  (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div>I snapped. <div class="bookquote">``Zeus declared the matter closed!''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``Percy, I know this is hard. But you must not rush out for vengeance. You aren't ready.''
 (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div>I didn't like it, but part of me suspected Chiron was right. One look at my hand, and I knew I
wasn't going to be sword fighting any time soon. <div class="bookquote">``Chiron ... your prophecy from the Oracle ... it was
about Kronos, wasn't it? Was I in it? And Annabeth?''
 (<font color='red'><b>Chiron</b></font>)</div>Chiron glanced nervously at the ceiling. ``Percy, it isn't my place-``
<div class="bookquote">``You've been ordered not to talk to me about it, haven't you?''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>His (<font color='blue'><b>guard</b></font>) eyes were sympathetic, but sad. <div class="bookquote">``You will be a great hero, child. I will do my best to prepare
you. But if I'm right about the path ahead of you ...''
 (<font color='red'><b>Thunder</b></font>)</div>Thunder boomed overhead, rattling the windows.
<div class="bookquote">``All right!''  (<font color='red'><b>Chiron</b></font>)</div>Chiron shouted. <div class="bookquote">``Fine!''
 (<font color='red'><b>He</b></font>)</div>He (<font color='blue'><b>guard</b></font>) sighed in frustration. <div class="bookquote">``The gods have their reasons, Percy. Knowing too much of your future is
never a good thing.''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``We can't just sit back and do nothing,''  (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div>I said.
<div class="bookquote">``We will not sit back,''  (<font color='red'><b>Chiron</b></font>)</div>Chiron promised. <div class="bookquote">``But you must be careful. Kronos wants you to come
unraveled. He (<font color='blue'><b>Percy</b></font>) wants your life disrupted, your thoughts clouded with fear and anger. Do not give him (<font color='blue'><b>Percy</b></font>)
what he (<font color='blue'><b>Percy</b></font>) wants. Train patiently. Your time will come.''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``Assuming I live that long.''
 (<font color='red'><b>Chiron</b></font>)</div>Chiron put his (<font color='blue'><b>guard</b></font>) hand on my ankle. <div class="bookquote">``You'll have to trust me, Percy. You will live. But first you must
decide your path for the coming year. I cannot tell you the right choice....''  (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div>I got the feeling that he (<font color='blue'><b>guard</b></font>) had
a very definite opinion, and it was taking all his (<font color='blue'><b>guard</b></font>) willpower not to advise me. <div class="bookquote">``But you must decide
whether to stay at Camp Half-Blood year-round, or return to the mortal world for seventh grade and
be a summer camper. Think on that. When I get back from Olympus, you must tell me your decision.''
 (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div>I wanted to protest. I wanted to ask him (<font color='blue'><b>guard</b></font>) more questions. But his (<font color='blue'><b>guard</b></font>) expression told me there could be
no more discussion; he (<font color='blue'><b>guard</b></font>) had said as much as he (<font color='blue'><b>guard</b></font>) could.
<div class="bookquote">``I'll be back as soon as I can,''  (<font color='red'><b>Chiron</b></font>)</div>Chiron promised. <div class="bookquote">``Argus will watch over you.''

 (<font color='red'><b>He</b></font>)</div><p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>guard</b></font>) glanced at Annabeth. <div class="bookquote">``Oh, and, my dear ... whenever you're ready, they're here.''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``Who's here?''  (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div>I asked.
Nobody answered.
Chiron rolled himself out of the room. I heard the wheels of his (<font color='blue'><b>guard</b></font>) chair clunk carefully down the
front steps, two at a time.
Annabeth studied the ice in my drink.
<div class="bookquote">``What's wrong?''  (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div>I asked her (<font color='blue'><b>my</b></font>).
<div class="bookquote">``Nothing.''  (<font color='red'><b>She</b></font>)</div>She (<font color='blue'><b>my</b></font>) set the glass on the table. <div class="bookquote">``I ... just took your advice about something. You ... um
... need anything?''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``Yeah. Help me up. I want to go outside.''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``Percy, that isn't a good idea.''
 (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div>I slid my legs out of bed. Annabeth caught me before I could crumple to the floor. A wave of
nausea rolled over me.
Annabeth said, <div class="bookquote">``I told you ...''
 (<font color='red'><b>Annabeth/ANNABETH</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``I'm fine,''  (<font color='red'><b>Annabeth/ANNABETH</b></font>)</div>I insisted. I didn't want to lie in bed like an invalid while Luke was out there planning
to destroy the Western world.
I managed a step forward. Then another, still leaning heavily on Annabeth. Argus followed us
outside, but he (<font color='blue'><b>Luke</b></font>) kept his (<font color='blue'><b>Luke</b></font>) distance.
By the time we reached the porch, my face was beaded with sweat. My stomach had twisted into
knots. But I had managed to make it all the way to the railing.
It was dusk. The camp looked completely deserted. The cabins were dark and the volleyball pit
silent. No canoes cut the surface of the lake. Beyond the woods and the strawberry fields, the Long
Island Sound glittered in the last light of the sun.
<div class="bookquote">``What are you going to do?''  (<font color='red'><b>Annabeth/ANNABETH</b></font>)</div>Annabeth asked me.
<div class="bookquote">``I don't know.''
 (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div>I told her (<font color='blue'><b>my</b></font>) I got the feeling Chiron wanted me to stay year-round, to put in more individual training
time, but I wasn't sure that's what I wanted. I admitted I'd feel bad about leaving her (<font color='blue'><b>my</b></font>) alone, though,
with only Clarisse for company....
Annabeth pursed her (<font color='blue'><b>Clarisse</b></font>) lips, then said quietly, <div class="bookquote">``I'm going home for the year, Percy.''
 (<font color='red'><b>Annabeth/ANNABETH</b></font>)</div>I stared at her (<font color='blue'><b>Clarisse</b></font>). <div class="bookquote">``You mean, to your dad's?''
 (<font color='red'><b>She</b></font>)</div>She (<font color='blue'><b>Clarisse</b></font>) pointed toward the crest of Half-Blood Hill. Next to Thalia's pine tree, at the very edge of
the camp's magical boundaries, a family stood silhouetted-two little children, a woman, and a tall
man with blond hair. They seemed to be waiting. The man was holding a backpack that looked like
the one Annabeth had gotten from Waterland in Denver.
<div class="bookquote">``I wrote him (<font color='blue'><b>dad</b></font>) a letter when we got back,''  (<font color='red'><b>Annabeth/ANNABETH</b></font>)</div>Annabeth said. <div class="bookquote">``Just like you suggested. I told him (<font color='blue'><b>dad</b></font>) ... I
was sorry. I'd come home for the school year if he (<font color='blue'><b>dad</b></font>) still wanted me. He (<font color='blue'><b>dad</b></font>) wrote back immediately. We
decided ... we'd give it another try.''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``That took guts.''
 (<font color='red'><b>She</b></font>)</div>She (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) pursed her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) lips. <div class="bookquote">``You won't try anything stupid during the school year, will you? At least ...
not without sending me an Iris-message?''
 (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div>I managed a smile. <div class="bookquote">``I won't go looking for trouble. I usually don't have to.''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``When I get back next summer,''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) said, <div class="bookquote">``we'll hunt down Luke. We'll ask for a quest, but if we
don't get approval, we'll sneak off and do it anyway. Agreed?''
 (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``Sounds like a plan worthy of Athena.''
 (<font color='red'><b>She</b></font>)</div>She (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) held out her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) hand. I shook it.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Take care, Seaweed Brain,''  (<font color='red'><b>Annabeth/ANNABETH</b></font>)</div>Annabeth told me. <div class="bookquote">``Keep your eyes open.''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``You too, Wise Girl.''
 (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div>I watched her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) walk up the hill and join her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) family. She (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) gave her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) father an awkward hug and
looked back at the valley one last time. She (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) touched Thalia's pine tree, then allowed herself to be
lead over the crest and into the mortal world.
For the first time at camp, I felt truly alone. I looked out at Long Island Sound and I remembered
my father saying, The sea does not like to be restrained.
I made my decision.
I wondered, if Poseidon were watching, would he (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) approve of my choice?
<div class="bookquote">``I'll be back next summer,''  (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div>I promised him (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>). <div class="bookquote">``I'll survive until then. After all, I am your son.''  (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div>I
asked Argus to take me down to cabin three, so I could pack my bags for home.
