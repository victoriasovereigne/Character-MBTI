The larger crimes are apt to be the simpler , for the bigger the crime the more obvious , as a rule , is the motive . In these cases , save for one rather intricate matter which has been referred to me from Marseilles , there is nothing which presents any features of interest .

Her dress was brown , rather darker than coffee colour , with a little purple plush at the neck and sleeves . Her gloves were greyish and were worn through at the right forefinger .

It is true that you have missed everything of importance , but you have hit upon the method , and you have a quick eye for colour . Never trust to general impressions , my boy , but concentrate yourself upon details . My first glance is always at a woman 's sleeve . In a man it is perhaps better first to take the knee of the trouser . As you observe , this woman had plush upon her sleeves , which is a most useful material for showing traces . The double line a little above the wrist , where the typewritist presses against the table , was beautifully defined . The sewing-machine , of the hand type , leaves a similar mark , but only on the left arm , and on the side of it farthest from the thumb , instead of being right across the broadest part , as this was .

It was a considerable sum , for people in their position , and the loss of it would have made a serious difference . It was worth an effort to preserve it . The daughter was of a good , amiable disposition , but affectionate and warm-hearted in her ways , so that it was evident that with her fair personal advantages , and her little income , she would not be allowed to remain single long . Now her marriage would mean , of course , the loss of a hundred a year , so what does her stepfather do to prevent it ? He takes the obvious course of keeping her at home and forbidding her to seek the company of people of her own age . But soon he found that that would not answer forever . She became restive , insisted upon her rights , and finally announced her positive intention of going to a certain ball . What does her clever stepfather do then ? He conceives an idea more creditable to his head than to his heart . With the connivance and assistance of his wife he disguised himself , covered those keen eyes with tinted glasses , masked the face with a moustache and a pair of bushy whiskers , sunk that clear voice into an insinuating whisper , and doubly secure on account of the girl 's short sight , he appears as Mr. Hosmer Angel , and keeps off other lovers by making love himself . '' ","i":28553},{"w":"`` It may be so , or it may not , Mr. Holmes , '' ","i":29200},{"w":"`` but if you are so very sharp you ought to be sharp enough to know that it is you who are breaking the law now , and not me .

However innocent he might be , he could not be such an absolute imbecile as not to see that the circumstances were very black against him . Had he appeared surprised at his own arrest , or feigned indignation at it , I should have looked upon it as highly suspicious , because such surprise or anger would not be natural under the circumstances , and yet might appear to be the best policy to a scheming man . His frank acceptance of the situation marks him as either an innocent man , or else as a man of considerable self-restraint and firmness . As to his remark about his deserts , it was also not unnatural if you consider that he stood beside the dead body of his father , and that there is no doubt that he had that very day so far forgotten his filial duty as to bandy words with him , and even , according to the little girl whose evidence is so important , to raise his hand as if to strike him . The self-reproach and contrition which are displayed in his remark appear to me to be the signs of a healthy mind rather than of a guilty one .

Too little , if he could not invent a cause of quarrel which would give him the sympathy of the jury ; too much , if he evolved from his own inner consciousness anything so outré as a dying reference to a rat , and the incident of the vanishing cloth . No , sir , I shall approach this case from the point of view that what this young man says is true , and we shall see whither that hypothesis will lead us .

As Cuvier could correctly describe a whole animal by the contemplation of a single bone , so the observer who has thoroughly understood one link in a series of incidents should be able to accurately state all the other ones , both before and after . We have not yet grasped the results which the reason alone can attain to . Problems may be solved in the study which have baffled all those who have sought a solution by the aid of their senses . To carry the art , however , to its highest pitch , it is necessary that the reasoner should be able to utilise all the facts which have come to his knowledge ; and this in itself implies , as you will readily see , a possession of all knowledge , which , even in these days of free education and encyclopaedias , is a somewhat rare accomplishment . It is not so impossible , however , that a man should possess all knowledge which is likely to be useful to him in his work , and this I have endeavoured in my case to do . If I remember rightly , you on one occasion , in the early days of our friendship , defined my limits in a very precise fashion . '' ","i":46910},{"w":"`` It was a singular document .

Those , I think , were the main points of my analysis . '' ","i":47182},{"w":"`` Well , '' ","i":47270},{"w":"`` Have you never -- '' ","i":48017},{"w":"`` have you never heard of the Ku Klux Klan ?

A name derived from the fanciful resemblance to the sound produced by cocking a rifle . This terrible secret society was formed by some ex-Confederate soldiers in the Southern states after the Civil War , and it rapidly formed local branches in different parts of the country , notably in Tennessee , Louisiana , the Carolinas , Georgia , and Florida . Its power was used for political purposes , principally for the terrorising of the negro voters and the murdering and driving from the country of those who were opposed to its views . Its outrages were usually preceded by a warning sent to the marked man in some fantastic but generally recognised shape -- a sprig of oak-leaves in some parts , melon seeds or orange pips in others . On receiving this the victim might either openly abjure his former ways , or might fly from the country . If he braved the matter out , death would unfailingly come upon him , and usually in some strange and unforeseen manner . So perfect was the organisation of the society , and so systematic its methods , that there is hardly a case upon record where any man succeeded in braving it with impunity , or in which any of its outrages were traced home to the perpetrators . For some years the organisation flourished in spite of the efforts of the United States government and of the better classes of the community in the South . Eventually , in the year 1869 , the movement rather suddenly collapsed , although there have been sporadic outbreaks of the same sort since that date . '' ","i":48074},{"w":"`` You will observe , '' ","i":48358},{"w":"`` that the sudden breaking up of the society was coincident with the disappearance of Openshaw from America with their papers . It may well have been cause and effect . It is no wonder that he and his family have some of the more implacable spirits upon their track . You can understand that this register and diary may implicate some of the first men in the South , and that there may be many who will not sleep easy at night until it is recovered . '' ","i":48372},{"w":"`` You will excuse me for not waiting for you , '' ","i":48664},{"w":"`` I have , I foresee , a very busy day before me in looking into this case of young Openshaw 's .

'' ","i":48832},{"w":"`` Between nine and ten last night Police-Constable Cook , of the H Division , on duty near Waterloo Bridge , heard a cry for help and a splash in the water . The night , however , was extremely dark and stormy , so that , in spite of the help of several passers-by , it was quite impossible to effect a rescue . The alarm , however , was given , and , by the aid of the water-police , the body was eventually recovered . It proved to be that of a young gentleman whose name , as it appears from an envelope which was found in his pocket , was John Openshaw , and whose residence is near Horsham . It is conjectured that he may have been hurrying down to catch the last train from Waterloo Station , and that in his haste and the extreme darkness he missed his path and walked over the edge of one of the small landing-places for river steamboats . The body exhibited no traces of violence , and there can be no doubt that the deceased had been the victim of an unfortunate accident , which should have the effect of calling the attention of the authorities to the condition of the riverside landing-stages .

John Horner , 26 , plumber , was brought up upon the charge of having upon the 22nd inst. , abstracted from the jewel-case of the Countess of Morcar the valuable gem known as the blue carbuncle . James Ryder , upper-attendant at the hotel , gave his evidence to the effect that he had shown Horner up to the dressing-room of the Countess of Morcar upon the day of the robbery in order that he might solder the second bar of the grate , which was loose . He had remained with Horner some little time , but had finally been called away . On returning , he found that Horner had disappeared , that the bureau had been forced open , and that the small morocco casket in which , as it afterwards transpired , the Countess was accustomed to keep her jewel , was lying empty upon the dressing-table . Ryder instantly gave the alarm , and Horner was arrested the same evening ; but the stone could not be found either upon his person or in his rooms . Catherine Cusack , maid to the Countess , deposed to having heard Ryder 's cry of dismay on discovering the robbery , and to having rushed into the room , where she found matters as described by the last witness . Inspector Bradstreet , B division , gave evidence as to the arrest of Horner , who struggled frantically , and protested his innocence in the strongest terms . Evidence of a previous conviction for robbery having been given against the prisoner , the magistrate refused to deal summarily with the offence , but referred it to the Assizes .

If I could only bring you down all would be well . Of course I might have fled from the house , but my curiosity was almost as strong as my fears . My mind was soon made up . I would send you a wire . I put on my hat and cloak , went down to the office , which is about half a mile from the house , and then returned , feeling very much easier . A horrible doubt came into my mind as I approached the door lest the dog might be loose , but I remembered that Toller had drunk himself into a state of insensibility that evening , and I knew that he was the only one in the household who had any influence with the savage creature , or who would venture to set him free . I slipped in in safety and lay awake half the night in my joy at the thought of seeing you . I had no difficulty in getting leave to come into Winchester this morning , but I must be back before three o'clock , for Mr. and Mrs. Rucastle are going on a visit , and will be away all the evening , so that I must look after the child .
