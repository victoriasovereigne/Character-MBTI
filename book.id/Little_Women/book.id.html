<p/>PLAYING PILGRIMS

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Christmas won't be Christmas without any presents,''  (<font color='red'><b>Jo/Miss Jo/JO</b></font>)</div>grumbled Jo, lying
on the rug.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``It's so dreadful to be poor!''  (<font color='red'><b>Meg</b></font>)</div>sighed Meg, looking down at her (<font color='blue'><b>Meg</b></font>) old
dress.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``I don't think it's fair for some girls to have plenty of pretty
things, and other girls nothing at all,''  (<font color='red'><b>Amy/Amy March</b></font>)</div>added little Amy, with an
injured sniff.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``We've got Father and Mother, and each other,''  (<font color='red'><b>Beth</b></font>)</div>said Beth contentedly
from her (<font color='blue'><b>Beth</b></font>) corner.

<p/>The four young faces on which the firelight shone brightened at the
cheerful words, but darkened again as Jo said sadly, <div class="bookquote">``We haven't got
Father, and shall not have him (<font color='blue'><b>Father</b></font>) for a long time.''  (<font color='red'><b>Jo/Miss Jo/JO</b></font>)</div>She (<font color='blue'><b>Jo</b></font>) didn't say
<div class="bookquote">``perhaps never,''  (<font color='red'><b>She</b></font>)</div>but each silently added it, thinking of Father far
away, where the fighting was.

<p/>Nobody spoke for a minute; then Meg said in an altered tone, <div class="bookquote">``You know
the reason Mother proposed not having any presents this Christmas was
because it is going to be a hard winter for everyone; and she (<font color='blue'><b>Mother</b></font>) thinks we
ought not to spend money for pleasure, when our men are suffering so in
the army. We can't do much, but we can make our little sacrifices, and
ought to do it gladly. But I am afraid I don't,''  (<font color='red'><b>Meg</b></font>)</div>and Meg shook her (<font color='blue'><b>Meg</b></font>)
head, as she (<font color='blue'><b>Meg</b></font>) thought regretfully of all the pretty things she (<font color='blue'><b>Meg</b></font>) wanted.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``But I don't think the little we should spend would do any good. We've
each got a dollar, and the army wouldn't be much helped by our giving
that. I agree not to expect anything from Mother or you, but I do want
to buy _Undine and Sintran_ for myself. I've wanted it so long,''  (<font color='red'><b>Jo/Miss Jo/JO</b></font>)</div>said
Jo, who was a bookworm.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``I planned to spend mine in new music,''  (<font color='red'><b>Beth</b></font>)</div>said Beth, with a little sigh,
which no one heard but the hearth brush and kettle-holder.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``I shall get a nice box of Faber's drawing pencils; I really need
them,''  (<font color='red'><b>Amy/Amy March</b></font>)</div>said Amy decidedly.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Mother didn't say anything about our money, and she (<font color='blue'><b>Mother</b></font>) won't wish us to
give up everything. Let's each buy what we want, and have a little
fun; I'm sure we work hard enough to earn it,''  (<font color='red'><b>Jo/Miss Jo/JO</b></font>)</div>cried Jo, examining the
heels of her (<font color='blue'><b>Amy</b></font>) shoes in a gentlemanly manner.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``I know I do--teaching those tiresome children nearly all day, when I'm
longing to enjoy myself at home,''  (<font color='red'><b>Meg</b></font>)</div>began Meg, in the complaining tone
again.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``You don't have half such a hard time as I do,''  (<font color='red'><b>Jo/Miss Jo/JO</b></font>)</div>said Jo. <div class="bookquote">``How would you
like to be shut up for hours with a nervous, fussy old lady, who keeps
you trotting, is never satisfied, and worries you till you're ready to
fly out the window or cry?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``It's naughty to fret, but I do think washing dishes and keeping things
tidy is the worst work in the world. It makes me cross, and my hands
get so stiff, I can't practice well at all.''  (<font color='red'><b>Beth</b></font>)</div>And Beth looked at her (<font color='blue'><b>Beth</b></font>)
rough hands with a sigh that any one could hear that time.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``I don't believe any of you suffer as I do,''  (<font color='red'><b>Amy/Amy March</b></font>)</div>cried Amy, <div class="bookquote">``for you don't
have to go to school with impertinent girls, who plague you if you
don't know your lessons, and laugh at your dresses, and label your
father if he (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) isn't rich, and insult you when your nose isn't nice.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Amy/Amy March</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``If you mean libel, I'd say so, and not talk about labels, as if Papa
was a pickle bottle,''  (<font color='red'><b>Jo/Miss Jo/JO</b></font>)</div>advised Jo, laughing.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``I know what I mean, and you needn't be statirical about it. It's
proper to use good words, and improve your vocabilary,''  (<font color='red'><b>Amy/Amy March</b></font>)</div>returned Amy,
with dignity.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Don't peck at one another, children. Don't you wish we had the money
Papa lost when we were little, Jo? Dear me! How happy and good we'd
be, if we had no worries!''  (<font color='red'><b>Meg</b></font>)</div>said Meg, who could remember better times.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``You said the other day you thought we were a deal happier than the
King children, for they were fighting and fretting all the time, in
spite of their money.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``So I did, Beth. Well, I think we are. For though we do have to work,
we make fun of ourselves, and are a pretty jolly set, as Jo would say.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Jo does use such slang words!''  (<font color='red'><b>Amy/Amy March</b></font>)</div>observed Amy, with a reproving look at
the long figure stretched on the rug.

<p/>Jo immediately sat up, put her (<font color='blue'><b>Jo</b></font>) hands in her (<font color='blue'><b>Jo</b></font>) pockets, and began to
whistle.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Don't, Jo. It's so boyish!''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``That's why I do it.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I detest rude, unladylike girls!''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I hate affected, niminy-piminy chits!''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Birds in their little nests agree,''  (<font color='red'><b>Beth</b></font>)</div>sang Beth, the peacemaker, with
such a funny face that both sharp voices softened to a laugh, and the
<div class="bookquote">``pecking''  (<font color='red'><b>the peacemaker</b></font>)</div>ended for that time.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Really, girls, you are both to be blamed,''  (<font color='red'><b>Meg</b></font>)</div>said Meg, beginning to
lecture in her (<font color='blue'><b>Meg</b></font>) elder-sisterly fashion. <div class="bookquote">``You are old enough to leave off
boyish tricks, and to behave better, Josephine. It didn't matter so
much when you were a little girl, but now you are so tall, and turn up
your hair, you should remember that you are a young lady.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I'm not! And if turning up my hair makes me one, I'll wear it in two
tails till I'm twenty,''  (<font color='red'><b>Jo/Miss Jo/JO</b></font>)</div>cried Jo, pulling off her (<font color='blue'><b>Jo</b></font>) net, and shaking down
a chestnut mane. <div class="bookquote">``I hate to think I've got to grow up, and be Miss
March, and wear long gowns, and look as prim as a China Aster! It's
bad enough to be a girl, anyway, when I like boy's games and work and
manners! I can't get over my disappointment in not being a boy. And
it's worse than ever now, for I'm dying to go and fight with Papa. And
I can only stay home and knit, like a poky old woman!''

 (<font color='red'><b>Jo/Miss Jo/JO</b></font>)</div><p/>And Jo shook the blue army sock till the needles rattled like
castanets, and her (<font color='blue'><b>Jo</b></font>) ball bounded across the room.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Poor Jo! It's too bad, but it can't be helped. So you must try to be
contented with making your name boyish, and playing brother to us
girls,''  (<font color='red'><b>Beth</b></font>)</div>said Beth, stroking the rough head with a hand that all the
dish washing and dusting in the world could not make ungentle in its
touch.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``As for you, Amy,''  (<font color='red'><b>Meg</b></font>)</div>continued Meg, <div class="bookquote">``you are altogether too particular
and prim. Your airs are funny now, but you'll grow up an affected
little goose, if you don't take care. I like your nice manners and
refined ways of speaking, when you don't try to be elegant. But your
absurd words are as bad as Jo's slang.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Meg</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``If Jo is a tomboy and Amy a goose, what am I, please?''  (<font color='red'><b>Beth</b></font>)</div>asked Beth,
ready to share the lecture.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``You're a dear, and nothing else,''  (<font color='red'><b>Meg</b></font>)</div>answered Meg warmly, and no one
contradicted her (<font color='blue'><b>Meg</b></font>), for the ``Mouse' was the pet of the family.

<p/>As young readers like to know `how people look', we will take this
moment to give them a little sketch of the four sisters, who sat
knitting away in the twilight, while the December snow fell quietly
without, and the fire crackled cheerfully within. It was a comfortable
room, though the carpet was faded and the furniture very plain, for a
good picture or two hung on the walls, books filled the recesses,
chrysanthemums and Christmas roses bloomed in the windows, and a
pleasant atmosphere of home peace pervaded it.

<p/>Margaret, the eldest of the four, was sixteen, and very pretty, being
plump and fair, with large eyes, plenty of soft brown hair, a sweet
mouth, and white hands, of which she (<font color='blue'><b>Margaret</b></font>) was rather vain. Fifteen-year-old
Jo was very tall, thin, and brown, and reminded one of a colt, for she (<font color='blue'><b>Jo</b></font>)
never seemed to know what to do with her (<font color='blue'><b>Jo</b></font>) long limbs, which were very
much in her (<font color='blue'><b>Jo</b></font>) way. She (<font color='blue'><b>Jo</b></font>) had a decided mouth, a comical nose, and sharp,
gray eyes, which appeared to see everything, and were by turns fierce,
funny, or thoughtful. Her (<font color='blue'><b>Jo</b></font>) long, thick hair was her (<font color='blue'><b>Jo</b></font>) one beauty, but it
was usually bundled into a net, to be out of her (<font color='blue'><b>Jo</b></font>) way. Round shoulders
had Jo, big hands and feet, a flyaway look to her (<font color='blue'><b>Jo</b></font>) clothes, and the
uncomfortable appearance of a girl who was rapidly shooting up into a
woman and didn't like it. Elizabeth, or Beth, as everyone called her (<font color='blue'><b>Beth</b></font>),
was a rosy, smooth-haired, bright-eyed girl of thirteen, with a shy
manner, a timid voice, and a peaceful expression which was seldom
disturbed. Her (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) father called her (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) ``Little Miss Tranquility', and the
name suited her (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) excellently, for she (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) seemed to live in a happy world of
her (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) own, only venturing out to meet the few whom she (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) trusted and loved.
Amy, though the youngest, was a most important person, in her (<font color='blue'><b>Amy</b></font>) own
opinion at least. A regular snow maiden, with blue eyes, and yellow
hair curling on her (<font color='blue'><b>Amy</b></font>) shoulders, pale and slender, and always carrying
herself like a young lady mindful of her (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) manners. What the characters
of the four sisters were we will leave to be found out.

<p/>The clock struck six and, having swept up the hearth, Beth put a pair
of slippers down to warm. Somehow the sight of the old shoes had a
good effect upon the girls, for Mother was coming, and everyone
brightened to welcome her (<font color='blue'><b>Mother</b></font>). Meg stopped lecturing, and lighted the
lamp, Amy got out of the easy chair without being asked, and Jo forgot
how tired she (<font color='blue'><b>Jo</b></font>) was as she (<font color='blue'><b>Jo</b></font>) sat up to hold the slippers nearer to the
blaze.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``They are quite worn out. Marmee must have a new pair.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I thought I'd get her (<font color='blue'><b>Jo</b></font>) some with my dollar,''  (<font color='red'><b>Beth</b></font>)</div>said Beth.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``No, I shall!''  (<font color='red'><b>Amy/Amy March</b></font>)</div>cried Amy.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``I'm the oldest,''  (<font color='red'><b>Meg</b></font>)</div>began Meg, but Jo cut in with a decided, <div class="bookquote">``I'm the man
of the family now Papa is away, and I shall provide the slippers, for
he (<font color='blue'><b>Papa</b></font>) told me to take special care of Mother while he (<font color='blue'><b>Papa</b></font>) was gone.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Jo/Miss Jo/JO</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I'll tell you what we'll do,''  (<font color='red'><b>Beth</b></font>)</div>said Beth, <div class="bookquote">``let's each get her (<font color='blue'><b>Mother</b></font>) something
for Christmas, and not get anything for ourselves.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Beth</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``That's like you, dear! What will we get?''  (<font color='red'><b>Jo/Miss Jo/JO</b></font>)</div>exclaimed Jo.

<p/>Everyone thought soberly for a minute, then Meg announced, as if the
idea was suggested by the sight of her (<font color='blue'><b>Meg</b></font>) own pretty hands, <div class="bookquote">``I shall give
her (<font color='blue'><b>Mother</b></font>) a nice pair of gloves.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Meg</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Army shoes, best to be had,''  (<font color='red'><b>Jo/Miss Jo/JO</b></font>)</div>cried Jo.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Some handkerchiefs, all hemmed,''  (<font color='red'><b>Beth</b></font>)</div>said Beth.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``I'll get a little bottle of cologne. She (<font color='blue'><b>Mother</b></font>) likes it, and it won't cost
much, so I'll have some left to buy my pencils,''  (<font color='red'><b>Amy/Amy March</b></font>)</div>added Amy.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``How will we give the things?''  (<font color='red'><b>Meg</b></font>)</div>asked Meg.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Put them on the table, and bring her (<font color='blue'><b>Mother</b></font>) in and see her (<font color='blue'><b>Mother</b></font>) open the bundles.
Don't you remember how we used to do on our birthdays?''  (<font color='red'><b>Jo/Miss Jo/JO</b></font>)</div>answered Jo.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``I used to be so frightened when it was my turn to sit in the chair
with the crown on, and see you all come marching round to give the
presents, with a kiss. I liked the things and the kisses, but it was
dreadful to have you sit looking at me while I opened the bundles,''
 (<font color='red'><b>Beth</b></font>)</div>said Beth, who was toasting her (<font color='blue'><b>Beth</b></font>) face and the bread for tea at the same
time.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Let Marmee think we are getting things for ourselves, and then
surprise her (<font color='blue'><b>Mother</b></font>). We must go shopping tomorrow afternoon, Meg. There is so
much to do about the play for Christmas night,''  (<font color='red'><b>Jo/Miss Jo/JO</b></font>)</div>said Jo, marching up
and down, with her (<font color='blue'><b>Jo</b></font>) hands behind her (<font color='blue'><b>Jo</b></font>) back, and her (<font color='blue'><b>Jo</b></font>) nose in the air.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``I don't mean to act any more after this time. I'm getting too old for
such things,''  (<font color='red'><b>Meg</b></font>)</div>observed Meg, who was as much a child as ever about
`dressing-up' frolics.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``You won't stop, I know, as long as you can trail round in a white gown
with your hair down, and wear gold-paper jewelry. You are the best
actress we've got, and there'll be an end of everything if you quit the
boards,''  (<font color='red'><b>Jo/Miss Jo/JO</b></font>)</div>said Jo. <div class="bookquote">``We ought to rehearse tonight. Come here, Amy, and
do the fainting scene, for you are as stiff as a poker in that.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I can't help it. I never saw anyone faint, and I don't choose to make
myself all black and blue, tumbling flat as you do. If I can go down
easily, I'll drop. If I can't, I shall fall into a chair and be
graceful. I don't care if Hugo does come at me with a pistol,''
 (<font color='red'><b>Amy/Amy March</b></font>)</div>returned Amy, who was not gifted with dramatic power, but was chosen
because she (<font color='blue'><b>Jo</b></font>) was small enough to be borne out shrieking by the villain
of the piece.

<p/>``Do it this way. Clasp your hands so, and stagger across the room,
crying frantically, <div class="bookquote">``Roderigo! Save me! Save me!'''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>and away went Jo,
with a melodramatic scream which was truly thrilling.

<p/>Amy followed, but she (<font color='blue'><b>Amy</b></font>) poked her (<font color='blue'><b>Amy</b></font>) hands out stiffly before her (<font color='blue'><b>Amy</b></font>), and
jerked herself along as if she (<font color='blue'><b>Amy</b></font>) went by machinery, and her (<font color='blue'><b>Amy</b></font>) <div class="bookquote">``Ow!''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>was
more suggestive of pins being run into her (<font color='blue'><b>Amy</b></font>) than of fear and anguish.
Jo gave a despairing groan, and Meg laughed outright, while Beth let
her (<font color='blue'><b>Beth</b></font>) bread burn as she (<font color='blue'><b>Beth</b></font>) watched the fun with interest. <div class="bookquote">``It's no use! Do
the best you can when the time comes, and if the audience laughs, don't
blame me. Come on, Meg.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Don Pedro</b></font>)</div><p/>Then things went smoothly, for Don Pedro defied the world in a speech
of two pages without a single break. Hagar, the witch, chanted an
awful incantation over her (<font color='blue'><b>witch</b></font>) kettleful of simmering toads, with weird
effect. Roderigo rent his (<font color='blue'><b>Hagar</b></font>) chains asunder manfully, and Hugo died in
agonies of remorse and arsenic, with a wild, <div class="bookquote">``Ha! Ha!''

 (<font color='red'><b>Hugo</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``It's the best we've had yet,''  (<font color='red'><b>Meg</b></font>)</div>said Meg, as the dead villain sat up and
rubbed his (<font color='blue'><b>villain</b></font>) elbows.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``I don't see how you can write and act such splendid things, Jo.
You're a regular Shakespeare!''  (<font color='red'><b>Beth</b></font>)</div>exclaimed Beth, who firmly believed that
her (<font color='blue'><b>Beth</b></font>) sisters were gifted with wonderful genius in all things.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Not quite,''  (<font color='red'><b>Jo/Miss Jo/JO</b></font>)</div>replied Jo modestly. ``I do think _The Witches Curse, an
Operatic Tragedy_ is rather a nice thing, but I'd like to try
_Macbeth_, if we only had a trapdoor for Banquo. I always wanted to do
the killing part. <div class="bookquote">``Is that a dagger that I see before me?''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>muttered
Jo, rolling her (<font color='blue'><b>Jo</b></font>) eyes and clutching at the air, as she (<font color='blue'><b>Jo</b></font>) had seen a famous
tragedian do.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``No, it's the toasting fork, with Mother's shoe on it instead of the
bread. Beth's stage-struck!''  (<font color='red'><b>Meg</b></font>)</div>cried Meg, and the rehearsal ended in a
general burst of laughter.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Glad to find you so merry, my girls,''  (<font color='red'><b>actors</b></font>)</div>said a cheery voice at the door,
and actors and audience turned to welcome a tall, motherly lady with a
`can I help you' look about her (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) which was truly delightful. She (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) was not
elegantly dressed, but a noble-looking woman, and the girls thought the
gray cloak and unfashionable bonnet covered the most splendid mother in
the world.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Well, dearies, how have you got on today? There was so much to do,
getting the boxes ready to go tomorrow, that I didn't come home to
dinner. Has anyone called, Beth? How is your cold, Meg? Jo, you look
tired to death. Come and kiss me, baby.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Amy/Amy March</b></font>)</div><p/>While making these maternal inquiries Mrs. March got her (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) wet things
off, her (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) warm slippers on, and sitting down in the easy chair, drew Amy
to her (<font color='blue'><b>Amy</b></font>) lap, preparing to enjoy the happiest hour of her (<font color='blue'><b>Amy</b></font>) busy day. The
girls flew about, trying to make things comfortable, each in her (<font color='blue'><b>Amy</b></font>) own
way. Meg arranged the tea table, Jo brought wood and set chairs,
dropping, over-turning, and clattering everything she (<font color='blue'><b>Jo</b></font>) touched. Beth
trotted to and fro between parlor kitchen, quiet and busy, while Amy
gave directions to everyone, as she (<font color='blue'><b>Amy</b></font>) sat with her (<font color='blue'><b>Amy</b></font>) hands folded.

<p/>As they gathered about the table, Mrs. March said, with a particularly
happy face, <div class="bookquote">``I've got a treat for you after supper.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/>A quick, bright smile went round like a streak of sunshine. Beth
clapped her (<font color='blue'><b>Beth</b></font>) hands, regardless of the biscuit she (<font color='blue'><b>Beth</b></font>) held, and Jo tossed up
her (<font color='blue'><b>Jo</b></font>) napkin, crying, <div class="bookquote">``A letter! A letter! Three cheers for Father!''

 (<font color='red'><b>Jo/Miss Jo/JO</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Yes, a nice long letter. He (<font color='blue'><b>Father</b></font>) is well, and thinks he (<font color='blue'><b>Father</b></font>) shall get through
the cold season better than we feared. He (<font color='blue'><b>Father</b></font>) sends all sorts of loving
wishes for Christmas, and an especial message to you girls,''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>said Mrs.
March, patting her (<font color='blue'><b>Jo</b></font>) pocket as if she (<font color='blue'><b>Jo</b></font>) had got a treasure there.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Hurry and get done! Don't stop to quirk your little finger and simper
over your plate, Amy,''  (<font color='red'><b>Jo/Miss Jo/JO</b></font>)</div>cried Jo, choking on her (<font color='blue'><b>Jo</b></font>) tea and dropping her (<font color='blue'><b>Jo</b></font>)
bread, butter side down, on the carpet in her (<font color='blue'><b>Jo</b></font>) haste to get at the treat.

<p/>Beth ate no more, but crept away to sit in her (<font color='blue'><b>Beth</b></font>) shadowy corner and brood
over the delight to come, till the others were ready.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``I think it was so splendid in Father to go as chaplain when he (<font color='blue'><b>Father</b></font>) was too
old to be drafted, and not strong enough for a soldier,''  (<font color='red'><b>Meg</b></font>)</div>said Meg
warmly.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Don't I wish I could go as a drummer, a vivan--what's its name? Or a
nurse, so I could be near him (<font color='blue'><b>drummer</b></font>) and help him (<font color='blue'><b>drummer</b></font>),''  (<font color='red'><b>Jo/Miss Jo/JO</b></font>)</div>exclaimed Jo, with a groan.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``It must be very disagreeable to sleep in a tent, and eat all sorts of
bad-tasting things, and drink out of a tin mug,''  (<font color='red'><b>Amy/Amy March</b></font>)</div>sighed Amy.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``When will he (<font color='blue'><b>drummer</b></font>) come home, Marmee?''  (<font color='red'><b>Beth</b></font>)</div>asked Beth, with a little quiver in
her (<font color='blue'><b>Amy</b></font>) voice.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Not for many months, dear, unless he (<font color='blue'><b>drummer</b></font>) is sick. He (<font color='blue'><b>drummer</b></font>) will stay and do his (<font color='blue'><b>drummer</b></font>)
work faithfully as long as he (<font color='blue'><b>drummer</b></font>) can, and we won't ask for him (<font color='blue'><b>drummer</b></font>) back a
minute sooner than he (<font color='blue'><b>drummer</b></font>) can be spared. Now come and hear the letter.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Mother</b></font>)</div><p/>They all drew to the fire, Mother in the big chair with Beth at her (<font color='blue'><b>Beth</b></font>)
feet, Meg and Amy perched on either arm of the chair, and Jo leaning on
the back, where no one would see any sign of emotion if the letter
should happen to be touching. Very few letters were written in those
hard times that were not touching, especially those which fathers sent
home. In this one little was said of the hardships endured, the
dangers faced, or the homesickness conquered. It was a cheerful,
hopeful letter, full of lively descriptions of camp life, marches, and
military news, and only at the end did the writer's heart over-flow
with fatherly love and longing for the little girls at home.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Give them all of my dear love and a kiss. Tell them I think of them
by day, pray for them by night, and find my best comfort in their
affection at all times. A year seems very long to wait before I see
them, but remind them that while we wait we may all work, so that these
hard days need not be wasted. I know they will remember all I said to
them, that they will be loving children to you, will do their duty
faithfully, fight their bosom enemies bravely, and conquer themselves
so beautifully that when I come back to them I may be fonder and
prouder than ever of my little women.''  (<font color='red'><b>Everybody</b></font>)</div>Everybody sniffed when they came
to that part. Jo wasn't ashamed of the great tear that dropped off the
end of her (<font color='blue'><b>Jo</b></font>) nose, and Amy never minded the rumpling of her (<font color='blue'><b>Amy</b></font>) curls as she (<font color='blue'><b>Amy</b></font>)
hid her (<font color='blue'><b>Amy</b></font>) face on her (<font color='blue'><b>Amy</b></font>) mother's shoulder and sobbed out, <div class="bookquote">``I am a selfish
girl! But I'll truly try to be better, so he (<font color='blue'><b>I</b></font>) mayn't be disappointed in
me by-and-by.''

 (<font color='red'><b>mother</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``We all will,''  (<font color='red'><b>Meg</b></font>)</div>cried Meg. <div class="bookquote">``I think too much of my looks and hate to
work, but won't any more, if I can help it.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I'll try and be what he (<font color='blue'><b>I</b></font>) loves to call me, 'a little woman' and not be
rough and wild, but do my duty here instead of wanting to be somewhere
else,''  (<font color='red'><b>Jo/Miss Jo/JO</b></font>)</div>said Jo, thinking that keeping her (<font color='blue'><b>Jo</b></font>) temper at home was a much
harder task than facing a rebel or two down South.

<p/>Beth said nothing, but wiped away her (<font color='blue'><b>Beth</b></font>) tears with the blue army sock and
began to knit with all her (<font color='blue'><b>Beth</b></font>) might, losing no time in doing the duty that
lay nearest her (<font color='blue'><b>Beth</b></font>), while she (<font color='blue'><b>Beth</b></font>) resolved in her (<font color='blue'><b>Beth</b></font>) quiet little soul to be all
that Father hoped to find her (<font color='blue'><b>Beth</b></font>) when the year brought round the happy
coming home.

<p/>Mrs. March broke the silence that followed Jo's words, by saying in her (<font color='blue'><b>Jo</b></font>)
cheery voice, <div class="bookquote">``Do you remember how you used to play Pilgrims Progress
when you were little things? Nothing delighted you more than to have
me tie my piece bags on your backs for burdens, give you hats and
sticks and rolls of paper, and let you travel through the house from
the cellar, which was the City of Destruction, up, up, to the housetop,
where you had all the lovely things you could collect to make a
Celestial City.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Jo/Miss Jo/JO</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``What fun it was, especially going by the lions, fighting Apollyon, and
passing through the valley where the hob-goblins were,''  (<font color='red'><b>Jo/Miss Jo/JO</b></font>)</div>said Jo.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``I liked the place where the bundles fell off and tumbled downstairs,''
 (<font color='red'><b>Meg</b></font>)</div>said Meg.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``I don't remember much about it, except that I was afraid of the cellar
and the dark entry, and always liked the cake and milk we had up at the
top. If I wasn't too old for such things, I'd rather like to play it
over again,''  (<font color='red'><b>Amy/Amy March</b></font>)</div>said Amy, who began to talk of renouncing childish things
at the mature age of twelve.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``We never are too old for this, my dear, because it is a play we are
playing all the time in one way or another. Our burdens are here, our
road is before us, and the longing for goodness and happiness is the
guide that leads us through many troubles and mistakes to the peace
which is a true Celestial City. Now, my little pilgrims, suppose you
begin again, not in play, but in earnest, and see how far on you can
get before Father comes home.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Really, Mother? Where are our bundles?''  (<font color='red'><b>Amy/Amy March</b></font>)</div>asked Amy, who was a very
literal young lady.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Each of you told what your burden was just now, except Beth. I rather
think she (<font color='blue'><b>Beth</b></font>) hasn't got any,''  (<font color='red'><b>mother</b></font>)</div>said her (<font color='blue'><b>Amy</b></font>) mother.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Yes, I have. Mine is dishes and dusters, and envying girls with nice
pianos, and being afraid of people.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Beth</b></font>)</div><p/>Beth's bundle was such a funny one that everybody wanted to laugh, but
nobody did, for it would have hurt her (<font color='blue'><b>Amy</b></font>) feelings very much.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Let us do it,''  (<font color='red'><b>Meg</b></font>)</div>said Meg thoughtfully. <div class="bookquote">``It is only another name for
trying to be good, and the story may help us, for though we do want to
be good, it's hard work and we forget, and don't do our best.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``We were in the Slough of Despond tonight, and Mother came and pulled
us out as Help did in the book. We ought to have our roll of
directions, like Christian. What shall we do about that?''  (<font color='red'><b>Jo/Miss Jo/JO</b></font>)</div>asked Jo,
delighted with the fancy which lent a little romance to the very dull
task of doing her (<font color='blue'><b>Jo</b></font>) duty.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Look under your pillows Christmas morning, and you will find your
guidebook,''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>replied Mrs. March.

<p/>They talked over the new plan while old Hannah cleared the table, then
out came the four little work baskets, and the needles flew as the
girls made sheets for Aunt March. It was uninteresting sewing, but
tonight no one grumbled. They adopted Jo's plan of dividing the long
seams into four parts, and calling the quarters Europe, Asia, Africa,
and America, and in that way got on capitally, especially when they
talked about the different countries as they stitched their way through
them.

<p/>At nine they stopped work, and sang, as usual, before they went to bed.
No one but Beth could get much music out of the old piano, but she (<font color='blue'><b>Beth</b></font>) had
a way of softly touching the yellow keys and making a pleasant
accompaniment to the simple songs they sang. Meg had a voice like a
flute, and she (<font color='blue'><b>Meg</b></font>) and her (<font color='blue'><b>Meg</b></font>) mother led the little choir. Amy chirped like a
cricket, and Jo wandered through the airs at her (<font color='blue'><b>Jo</b></font>) own sweet will, always
coming out at the wrong place with a croak or a quaver that spoiled the
most pensive tune. They had always done this from the time they could
lisp...

<p/>Crinkle, crinkle, `ittle `tar,

<p/>and it had become a household custom, for the mother was a born singer.
The first sound in the morning was her (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) voice as she (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) went about the
house singing like a lark, and the last sound at night was the same
cheery sound, for the girls never grew too old for that familiar
lullaby.



<p/>CHAPTER TWO

<p/>A MERRY CHRISTMAS

<p/>Jo was the first to wake in the gray dawn of Christmas morning. No
stockings hung at the fireplace, and for a moment she (<font color='blue'><b>Jo</b></font>) felt as much
disappointed as she (<font color='blue'><b>Jo</b></font>) did long ago, when her (<font color='blue'><b>Jo</b></font>) little sock fell down
because it was crammed so full of goodies. Then she (<font color='blue'><b>Jo</b></font>) remembered her (<font color='blue'><b>Jo</b></font>)
mother's promise and, slipping her (<font color='blue'><b>Jo</b></font>) hand under her (<font color='blue'><b>Jo</b></font>) pillow, drew out a
little crimson-covered book. She (<font color='blue'><b>Jo</b></font>) knew it very well, for it was that
beautiful old story of the best life ever lived, and Jo felt that it
was a true guidebook for any pilgrim going on a long journey. She (<font color='blue'><b>Jo</b></font>) woke
Meg with a <div class="bookquote">``Merry Christmas,''  (<font color='red'><b>Meg</b></font>)</div>and bade her (<font color='blue'><b>Jo</b></font>) see what was under her (<font color='blue'><b>Jo</b></font>)
pillow. A green-covered book appeared, with the same picture inside,
and a few words written by their mother, which made their one present
very precious in their eyes. Presently Beth and Amy woke to rummage
and find their little books also, one dove-colored, the other blue, and
all sat looking at and talking about them, while the east grew rosy
with the coming day.

<p/>In spite of her (<font color='blue'><b>Beth</b></font>) small vanities, Margaret had a sweet and pious nature,
which unconsciously influenced her (<font color='blue'><b>Margaret</b></font>) sisters, especially Jo, who loved
her (<font color='blue'><b>Jo</b></font>) very tenderly, and obeyed her (<font color='blue'><b>Jo</b></font>) because her (<font color='blue'><b>Jo</b></font>) advice was so gently
given.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Girls,''  (<font color='red'><b>Meg</b></font>)</div>said Meg seriously, looking from the tumbled head beside her (<font color='blue'><b>Meg</b></font>)
to the two little night-capped ones in the room beyond, <div class="bookquote">``Mother wants
us to read and love and mind these books, and we must begin at once.
We used to be faithful about it, but since Father went away and all
this war trouble unsettled us, we have neglected many things. You can
do as you please, but I shall keep my book on the table here and read a
little every morning as soon as I wake, for I know it will do me good
and help me through the day.''

 (<font color='red'><b>the ones</b></font>)</div><p/>Then she (<font color='blue'><b>Meg</b></font>) opened her (<font color='blue'><b>Meg</b></font>) new book and began to read. Jo put her (<font color='blue'><b>Jo</b></font>) arm round
her (<font color='blue'><b>Jo</b></font>) and, leaning cheek to cheek, read also, with the quiet expression
so seldom seen on her (<font color='blue'><b>Jo</b></font>) restless face.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``How good Meg is! Come, Amy, let's do as they do. I'll help you with
the hard words, and they'll explain things if we don't understand,''
 (<font color='red'><b>Beth</b></font>)</div>whispered Beth, very much impressed by the pretty books and her (<font color='blue'><b>Beth</b></font>)
sisters' example.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``I'm glad mine is blue,''  (<font color='red'><b>Amy/Amy March</b></font>)</div>said Amy. and then the rooms were very still
while the pages were softly turned, and the winter sunshine crept in to
touch the bright heads and serious faces with a Christmas greeting.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Where is Mother?''  (<font color='red'><b>Meg</b></font>)</div>asked Meg, as she (<font color='blue'><b>Meg</b></font>) and Jo ran down to thank her (<font color='blue'><b>Jo</b></font>) for
their gifts, half an hour later.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Goodness only knows. Some poor creeter came a-beggin', and your ma
went straight off to see what was needed. There never was such a woman
for givin' away vittles and drink, clothes and firin',''  (<font color='red'><b>Hannah</b></font>)</div>replied Hannah,
who had lived with the family since Meg was born, and was considered by
them all more as a friend than a servant.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``She (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) will be back soon, I think, so fry your cakes, and have everything
ready,''  (<font color='red'><b>Meg</b></font>)</div>said Meg, looking over the presents which were collected in a
basket and kept under the sofa, ready to be produced at the proper
time. <div class="bookquote">``Why, where is Amy's bottle of cologne?''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Meg</b></font>) added, as the
little flask did not appear.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``She (<font color='blue'><b>Amy</b></font>) took it out a minute ago, and went off with it to put a ribbon on
it, or some such notion,''  (<font color='red'><b>Jo/Miss Jo/JO</b></font>)</div>replied Jo, dancing about the room to take
the first stiffness off the new army slippers.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``How nice my handkerchiefs look, don't they? Hannah washed and ironed
them for me, and I marked them all myself,''  (<font color='red'><b>Beth</b></font>)</div>said Beth, looking proudly
at the somewhat uneven letters which had cost her (<font color='blue'><b>Beth</b></font>) such labor.

<p/>``Bless the child! She (<font color='blue'><b>Hannah</b></font>)'s gone and put ``Mother' on them instead of <div class="bookquote">``M.
March'. How funny!''  (<font color='red'><b>Mother</b></font>)</div>cried Jo, taking one up.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Isn't that right? I thought it was better to do it so, because Meg's
initials are M.M., and I don't want anyone to use these but Marmee,''
 (<font color='red'><b>Beth</b></font>)</div>said Beth, looking troubled.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``It's all right, dear, and a very pretty idea, quite sensible too, for
no one can ever mistake now. It will please her (<font color='blue'><b>Meg</b></font>) very much, I know,''
 (<font color='red'><b>Meg</b></font>)</div>said Meg, with a frown for Jo and a smile for Beth.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``There's Mother. Hide the basket, quick!''  (<font color='red'><b>Jo/Miss Jo/JO</b></font>)</div>cried Jo, as a door slammed
and steps sounded in the hall.

<p/>Amy came in hastily, and looked rather abashed when she (<font color='blue'><b>Amy</b></font>) saw her (<font color='blue'><b>Amy</b></font>) sisters
all waiting for her (<font color='blue'><b>Amy</b></font>).

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Where have you been, and what are you hiding behind you?''  (<font color='red'><b>Meg</b></font>)</div>asked Meg,
surprised to see, by her (<font color='blue'><b>Meg</b></font>) hood and cloak, that lazy Amy had been out so
early.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Don't laugh at me, Jo! I didn't mean anyone should know till the time
came. I only meant to change the little bottle for a big one, and I
gave all my money to get it, and I'm truly trying not to be selfish any
more.''

 (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div><p/>As she (<font color='blue'><b>Amy</b></font>) spoke, Amy showed the handsome flask which replaced the cheap
one, and looked so earnest and humble in her (<font color='blue'><b>Amy</b></font>) little effort to forget
herself that Meg hugged her (<font color='blue'><b>Meg</b></font>) on the spot, and Jo pronounced her (<font color='blue'><b>Jo</b></font>) 'a
trump', while Beth ran to the window, and picked her (<font color='blue'><b>Beth</b></font>) finest rose to
ornament the stately bottle.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``You see I felt ashamed of my present, after reading and talking about
being good this morning, so I ran round the corner and changed it the
minute I was up, and I'm so glad, for mine is the handsomest now.''

 (<font color='red'><b>the girls</b></font>)</div><p/>Another bang of the street door sent the basket under the sofa, and the
girls to the table, eager for breakfast.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Merry Christmas, Marmee! Many of them! Thank you for our books. We
read some, and mean to every day,''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>they all cried in chorus.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Merry Christmas, little daughters! I'm glad you began at once, and
hope you will keep on. But I want to say one word before we sit down.
Not far away from here lies a poor woman with a little newborn baby.
Six children are huddled into one bed to keep from freezing, for they
have no fire. There is nothing to eat over there, and the oldest boy
came to tell me they were suffering hunger and cold. My girls, will
you give them your breakfast as a Christmas present?''

 (<font color='red'><b>Jo/Miss Jo/JO</b></font>)</div><p/>They were all unusually hungry, having waited nearly an hour, and for a
minute no one spoke, only a minute, for Jo exclaimed impetuously, <div class="bookquote">``I'm
so glad you came before we began!''

 (<font color='red'><b>Jo/Miss Jo/JO</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``May I go and help carry the things to the poor little children?''  (<font color='red'><b>Beth</b></font>)</div>asked
Beth eagerly.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``I shall take the cream and the muffings,''  (<font color='red'><b>Amy/Amy March</b></font>)</div>added Amy, heroically giving
up the article she (<font color='blue'><b>Amy</b></font>) most liked.

<p/>Meg was already covering the buckwheats, and piling the bread into one
big plate.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``I thought you'd do it,''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>said Mrs. March, smiling as if satisfied. <div class="bookquote">``You
shall all go and help me, and when we come back we will have bread and
milk for breakfast, and make it up at dinnertime.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/>They were soon ready, and the procession set out. Fortunately it was
early, and they went through back streets, so few people saw them, and
no one laughed at the queer party.

<p/>A poor, bare, miserable room it was, with broken windows, no fire,
ragged bedclothes, a sick mother, wailing baby, and a group of pale,
hungry children cuddled under one old quilt, trying to keep warm.

<p/>How the big eyes stared and the blue lips smiled as the girls went in.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Ach, mein Gott! It is good angels come to us!''  (<font color='red'><b>the woman</b></font>)</div>said the poor woman,
crying for joy.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Funny angels in hoods and mittens,''  (<font color='red'><b>Jo/Miss Jo/JO</b></font>)</div>said Jo, and set them to laughing.

<p/>In a few minutes it really did seem as if kind spirits had been at work
there. Hannah, who had carried wood, made a fire, and stopped up the
broken panes with old hats and her (<font color='blue'><b>Hannah</b></font>) own cloak. Mrs. March gave the
mother tea and gruel, and comforted her (<font color='blue'><b>Hannah</b></font>) with promises of help, while
she (<font color='blue'><b>Hannah</b></font>) dressed the little baby as tenderly as if it had been her (<font color='blue'><b>Hannah</b></font>) own. The
girls meantime spread the table, set the children round the fire, and
fed them like so many hungry birds, laughing, talking, and trying to
understand the funny broken English.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Das ist gut!''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``Die Engel-kinder!''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>cried the poor things as they ate
and warmed their purple hands at the comfortable blaze. The girls had
never been called angel children before, and thought it very agreeable,
especially Jo, who had been considered a ``Sancho' ever since she (<font color='blue'><b>we</b></font>) was
born. That was a very happy breakfast, though they didn't get any of
it. And when they went away, leaving comfort behind, I think there
were not in all the city four merrier people than the hungry little
girls who gave away their breakfasts and contented themselves with
bread and milk on Christmas morning.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``That's loving our neighbor better than ourselves, and I like it,''  (<font color='red'><b>Meg</b></font>)</div>said
Meg, as they set out their presents while their mother was upstairs
collecting clothes for the poor Hummels.

<p/>Not a very splendid show, but there was a great deal of love done up in
the few little bundles, and the tall vase of red roses, white
chrysanthemums, and trailing vines, which stood in the middle, gave
quite an elegant air to the table.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``She (<font color='blue'><b>we</b></font>)'s coming! Strike up, Beth! Open the door, Amy! Three cheers for
Marmee!''  (<font color='red'><b>Jo/Miss Jo/JO</b></font>)</div>cried Jo, prancing about while Meg went to conduct Mother to
the seat of honor.

<p/>Beth played her (<font color='blue'><b>Beth</b></font>) gayest march, Amy threw open the door, and Meg enacted
escort with great dignity. Mrs. March was both surprised and touched,
and smiled with her (<font color='blue'><b>Meg</b></font>) eyes full as she (<font color='blue'><b>Meg</b></font>) examined her (<font color='blue'><b>Meg</b></font>) presents and read the
little notes which accompanied them. The slippers went on at once, a
new handkerchief was slipped into her (<font color='blue'><b>Meg</b></font>) pocket, well scented with Amy's
cologne, the rose was fastened in her (<font color='blue'><b>Meg</b></font>) bosom, and the nice gloves were
pronounced a perfect fit.

<p/>There was a good deal of laughing and kissing and explaining, in the
simple, loving fashion which makes these home festivals so pleasant at
the time, so sweet to remember long afterward, and then all fell to
work.

<p/>The morning charities and ceremonies took so much time that the rest of
the day was devoted to preparations for the evening festivities. Being
still too young to go often to the theater, and not rich enough to
afford any great outlay for private performances, the girls put their
wits to work, and necessity being the mother of invention, made
whatever they needed. Very clever were some of their productions,
pasteboard guitars, antique lamps made of old-fashioned butter boats
covered with silver paper, gorgeous robes of old cotton, glittering
with tin spangles from a pickle factory, and armor covered with the
same useful diamond shaped bits left in sheets when the lids of
preserve pots were cut out. The big chamber was the scene of many
innocent revels.

<p/>No gentleman were admitted, so Jo played male parts to her (<font color='blue'><b>Jo</b></font>) heart's
content and took immense satisfaction in a pair of russet leather boots
given her (<font color='blue'><b>Jo</b></font>) by a friend, who knew a lady who knew an actor. These boots,
an old foil, and a slashed doublet once used by an artist for some
picture, were Jo's chief treasures and appeared on all occasions. The
smallness of the company made it necessary for the two principal actors
to take several parts apiece, and they certainly deserved some credit
for the hard work they did in learning three or four different parts,
whisking in and out of various costumes, and managing the stage
besides. It was excellent drill for their memories, a harmless
amusement, and employed many hours which otherwise would have been
idle, lonely, or spent in less profitable society.

<p/>On Christmas night, a dozen girls piled onto the bed which was the
dress circle, and sat before the blue and yellow chintz curtains in a
most flattering state of expectancy. There was a good deal of rustling
and whispering behind the curtain, a trifle of lamp smoke, and an
occasional giggle from Amy, who was apt to get hysterical in the
excitement of the moment. Presently a bell sounded, the curtains flew
apart, and the _operatic tragedy_ began.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``A gloomy wood,''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>according to the one playbill, was represented by a
few shrubs in pots, green baize on the floor, and a cave in the
distance. This cave was made with a clothes horse for a roof, bureaus
for walls, and in it was a small furnace in full blast, with a black
pot on it and an old witch bending over it. The stage was dark and the
glow of the furnace had a fine effect, especially as real steam issued
from the kettle when the witch took off the cover. A moment was
allowed for the first thrill to subside, then Hugo, the villain,
stalked in with a clanking sword at his (<font color='blue'><b>Hugo</b></font>) side, a slouching hat, black
beard, mysterious cloak, and the boots. After pacing to and fro in
much agitation, he (<font color='blue'><b>Hugo</b></font>) struck his (<font color='blue'><b>Hugo</b></font>) forehead, and burst out in a wild strain,
singing of his (<font color='blue'><b>Hugo</b></font>) hatred for Roderigo, his (<font color='blue'><b>Hugo</b></font>) love for Zara, and his (<font color='blue'><b>Hugo</b></font>) pleasing
resolution to kill the one and win the other. The gruff tones of Hugo's
voice, with an occasional shout when his (<font color='blue'><b>Hugo</b></font>) feelings overcame him (<font color='blue'><b>Hugo</b></font>), were
very impressive, and the audience applauded the moment he (<font color='blue'><b>Hugo</b></font>) paused for
breath. Bowing with the air of one accustomed to public praise, he (<font color='blue'><b>Hugo</b></font>)
stole to the cavern and ordered Hagar to come forth with a commanding,
<div class="bookquote">``What ho, minion! I need thee!''

 (<font color='red'><b>Hagar</b></font>)</div><p/>Out came Meg, with gray horsehair hanging about her (<font color='blue'><b>Meg</b></font>) face, a red and
black robe, a staff, and cabalistic signs upon her (<font color='blue'><b>Meg</b></font>) cloak. Hugo
demanded a potion to make Zara adore him (<font color='blue'><b>Hugo</b></font>), and one to destroy Roderigo.
Hagar, in a fine dramatic melody, promised both, and proceeded to call
up the spirit who would bring the love philter.

<p/>Hither, hither, from thy home,
Airy sprite, I bid thee come!
Born of roses, fed on dew,
Charms and potions canst thou brew?
Bring me here, with elfin speed,
The fragrant philter which I need.
Make it sweet and swift and strong,
Spirit, answer now my song!

<p/>A soft strain of music sounded, and then at the back of the cave
appeared a little figure in cloudy white, with glittering wings, golden
hair, and a garland of roses on its head. Waving a wand, it sang...

<p/>Hither I come,
From my airy home,
Afar in the silver moon.
Take the magic spell,
And use it well,
Or its power will vanish soon!

<p/>And dropping a small, gilded bottle at the witch's feet, the spirit
vanished. Another chant from Hagar produced another apparition, not a
lovely one, for with a bang an ugly black imp appeared and, having
croaked a reply, tossed a dark bottle at Hugo and disappeared with a
mocking laugh. Having warbled his (<font color='blue'><b>Hugo</b></font>) thanks and put the potions in his (<font color='blue'><b>Hugo</b></font>)
boots, Hugo departed, and Hagar informed the audience that as he (<font color='blue'><b>Hagar</b></font>) had
killed a few of her (<font color='blue'><b>witch</b></font>) friends in times past, she (<font color='blue'><b>witch</b></font>) had cursed him (<font color='blue'><b>Hagar</b></font>), and
intends to thwart his (<font color='blue'><b>Hagar</b></font>) plans, and be revenged on him (<font color='blue'><b>Hagar</b></font>). Then the curtain
fell, and the audience reposed and ate candy while discussing the
merits of the play.

<p/>A good deal of hammering went on before the curtain rose again, but
when it became evident what a masterpiece of stage carpentery had been
got up, no one murmured at the delay. It was truly superb. A tower
rose to the ceiling, halfway up appeared a window with a lamp burning
in it, and behind the white curtain appeared Zara in a lovely blue and
silver dress, waiting for Roderigo. He (<font color='blue'><b>Hagar</b></font>) came in gorgeous array, with
plumed cap, red cloak, chestnut lovelocks, a guitar, and the boots, of
course. Kneeling at the foot of the tower, he (<font color='blue'><b>Hagar</b></font>) sang a serenade in
melting tones. Zara replied and, after a musical dialogue, consented
to fly. Then came the grand effect of the play. Roderigo produced a
rope ladder, with five steps to it, threw up one end, and invited Zara
to descend. Timidly she (<font color='blue'><b>Zara</b></font>) crept from her (<font color='blue'><b>Zara</b></font>) lattice, put her (<font color='blue'><b>Zara</b></font>) hand on
Roderigo's shoulder, and was about to leap gracefully down when <div class="bookquote">``Alas!
Alas for Zara!''  (<font color='red'><b>Roderigo</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Zara</b></font>) forgot her (<font color='blue'><b>Zara</b></font>) train. It caught in the window, the
tower tottered, leaned forward, fell with a crash, and buried the
unhappy lovers in the ruins.

<p/>A universal shriek arose as the russet boots waved wildly from the
wreck and a golden head emerged, exclaiming, <div class="bookquote">``I told you so! I told
you so!''  (<font color='red'><b>Don Pedro</b></font>)</div>With wonderful presence of mind, Don Pedro, the cruel sire,
rushed in, dragged out his (<font color='blue'><b>Pedro</b></font>) daughter, with a hasty aside...

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Don't laugh! Act as if it was all right!''  (<font color='red'><b>daughter</b></font>)</div>and, ordering Roderigo up,
banished him (<font color='blue'><b>Pedro</b></font>) from the kingdom with wrath and scorn. Though decidedly
shaken by the fall from the tower upon him (<font color='blue'><b>Pedro</b></font>), Roderigo defied the old
gentleman and refused to stir. This dauntless example fired Zara. She (<font color='blue'><b>Zara</b></font>)
also defied her (<font color='blue'><b>Zara</b></font>) sire, and he (<font color='blue'><b>sire</b></font>) ordered them both to the deepest dungeons
of the castle. A stout little retainer came in with chains and led
them away, looking very much frightened and evidently forgetting the
speech he (<font color='blue'><b>sire</b></font>) ought to have made.

<p/>Act third was the castle hall, and here Hagar appeared, having come to
free the lovers and finish Hugo. She (<font color='blue'><b>Zara</b></font>) hears him (<font color='blue'><b>Hugo</b></font>) coming and hides, sees
him (<font color='blue'><b>Hugo</b></font>) put the potions into two cups of wine and bid the timid little
servant, <div class="bookquote">``Bear them to the captives in their cells, and tell them I
shall come anon.''  (<font color='red'><b>the servant</b></font>)</div>The servant takes Hugo aside to tell him (<font color='blue'><b>Hugo</b></font>) something,
and Hagar changes the cups for two others which are harmless.
Ferdinando, the `minion', carries them away, and Hagar puts back the
cup which holds the poison meant for Roderigo. Hugo, getting thirsty
after a long warble, drinks it, loses his (<font color='blue'><b>Hugo</b></font>) wits, and after a good deal
of clutching and stamping, falls flat and dies, while Hagar informs him (<font color='blue'><b>Hagar</b></font>)
what she (<font color='blue'><b>minion</b></font>) has done in a song of exquisite power and melody.

<p/>This was a truly thrilling scene, though some persons might have
thought that the sudden tumbling down of a quantity of long red hair
rather marred the effect of the villain's death. He (<font color='blue'><b>villain</b></font>) was called before
the curtain, and with great propriety appeared, leading Hagar, whose
singing was considered more wonderful than all the rest of the
performance put together.

<p/>Act fourth displayed the despairing Roderigo on the point of stabbing
himself because he (<font color='blue'><b>Hagar</b></font>) has been told that Zara has deserted him (<font color='blue'><b>Hagar</b></font>). Just as
the dagger is at his (<font color='blue'><b>Hagar</b></font>) heart, a lovely song is sung under his (<font color='blue'><b>Hagar</b></font>) window,
informing him (<font color='blue'><b>Hagar</b></font>) that Zara is true but in danger, and he (<font color='blue'><b>Hagar</b></font>) can save her (<font color='blue'><b>Zara</b></font>) if
he (<font color='blue'><b>Hagar</b></font>) will. A key is thrown in, which unlocks the door, and in a spasm of
rapture he (<font color='blue'><b>Hagar</b></font>) tears off his (<font color='blue'><b>Hagar</b></font>) chains and rushes away to find and rescue his (<font color='blue'><b>Hagar</b></font>)
lady love.

<p/>Act fifth opened with a stormy scene between Zara and Don Pedro. He (<font color='blue'><b>Pedro</b></font>)
wishes her (<font color='blue'><b>Zara</b></font>) to go into a convent, but she (<font color='blue'><b>Zara</b></font>) won't hear of it, and after a
touching appeal, is about to faint when Roderigo dashes in and demands
her (<font color='blue'><b>Zara</b></font>) hand. Don Pedro refuses, because he (<font color='blue'><b>Pedro</b></font>) is not rich. They shout and
gesticulate tremendously but cannot agree, and Rodrigo is about to bear
away the exhausted Zara, when the timid servant enters with a letter
and a bag from Hagar, who has mysteriously disappeared. The latter
informs the party that she (<font color='blue'><b>Zara</b></font>) bequeaths untold wealth to the young pair
and an awful doom to Don Pedro, if he (<font color='blue'><b>Pedro</b></font>) doesn't make them happy. The bag
is opened, and several quarts of tin money shower down upon the stage
till it is quite glorified with the glitter. This entirely softens the
stern sire. He (<font color='blue'><b>sire</b></font>) consents without a murmur, all join in a joyful chorus,
and the curtain falls upon the lovers kneeling to receive Don Pedro's
blessing in attitudes of the most romantic grace.

<p/>Tumultuous applause followed but received an unexpected check, for the
cot bed, on which the dress circle was built, suddenly shut up and
extinguished the enthusiastic audience. Roderigo and Don Pedro flew to
the rescue, and all were taken out unhurt, though many were speechless
with laughter. The excitement had hardly subsided when Hannah
appeared, with <div class="bookquote">``Mrs. March's compliments, and would the ladies walk
down to supper.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Hannah</b></font>)</div><p/>This was a surprise even to the actors, and when they saw the table,
they looked at one another in rapturous amazement. It was like Marmee
to get up a little treat for them, but anything so fine as this was
unheard of since the departed days of plenty. There was ice cream,
actually two dishes of it, pink and white, and cake and fruit and
distracting French bonbons and, in the middle of the table, four great
bouquets of hot house flowers.

<p/>It quite took their breath away, and they stared first at the table and
then at their mother, who looked as if she (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) enjoyed it immensely.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Is it fairies?''  (<font color='red'><b>Amy/Amy March</b></font>)</div>asked Amy.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Santa Claus,''  (<font color='red'><b>Beth</b></font>)</div>said Beth.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Mother did it.''  (<font color='red'><b>Meg</b></font>)</div>And Meg smiled her (<font color='blue'><b>Meg</b></font>) sweetest, in spite of her (<font color='blue'><b>Meg</b></font>) gray
beard and white eyebrows.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Aunt March had a good fit and sent the supper,''  (<font color='red'><b>Jo/Miss Jo/JO</b></font>)</div>cried Jo, with a
sudden inspiration.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``All wrong. Old Mr. Laurence sent it,''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>replied Mrs. March.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``The Laurence boy's grandfather! What in the world put such a thing
into his (<font color='blue'><b>Laurence</b></font>) head? We don't know him (<font color='blue'><b>Laurence</b></font>)!''  (<font color='red'><b>Meg</b></font>)</div>exclaimed Meg.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Hannah told one of his (<font color='blue'><b>Laurence</b></font>) servants about your breakfast party. He (<font color='blue'><b>Laurence</b></font>) is an
odd old gentleman, but that pleased him (<font color='blue'><b>Laurence</b></font>). He (<font color='blue'><b>Laurence</b></font>) knew my father years ago,
and he (<font color='blue'><b>Laurence</b></font>) sent me a polite note this afternoon, saying he (<font color='blue'><b>Laurence</b></font>) hoped I would
allow him (<font color='blue'><b>Laurence</b></font>) to express his (<font color='blue'><b>Laurence</b></font>) friendly feeling toward my children by sending
them a few trifles in honor of the day. I could not refuse, and so you
have a little feast at night to make up for the bread-and-milk
breakfast.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``That boy put it into his (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>) head, I know he (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>) did! He (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>)'s a capital fellow,
and I wish we could get acquainted. He (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>) looks as if he (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>)'d like to know
us but he (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>)'s bashful, and Meg is so prim she (<font color='blue'><b>Meg</b></font>) won't let me speak to him (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>)
when we pass,''  (<font color='red'><b>Jo/Miss Jo/JO</b></font>)</div>said Jo, as the plates went round, and the ice began to
melt out of sight, with ohs and ahs of satisfaction.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``You mean the people who live in the big house next door, don't you?''
 (<font color='red'><b>the girls</b></font>)</div>asked one of the girls. <div class="bookquote">``My mother knows old Mr. Laurence, but says
he (<font color='blue'><b>Laurence</b></font>)'s very proud and doesn't like to mix with his (<font color='blue'><b>Laurence</b></font>) neighbors. He (<font color='blue'><b>Laurence</b></font>) keeps
his (<font color='blue'><b>Laurence</b></font>) grandson shut up, when he (<font color='blue'><b>Laurence</b></font>) isn't riding or walking with his (<font color='blue'><b>Laurence</b></font>) tutor,
and makes him (<font color='blue'><b>Laurence</b></font>) study very hard. We invited him (<font color='blue'><b>Laurence</b></font>) to our party, but he (<font color='blue'><b>Laurence</b></font>)
didn't come. Mother says he (<font color='blue'><b>Laurence</b></font>)'s very nice, though he (<font color='blue'><b>Laurence</b></font>) never speaks to us
girls.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Our cat ran away once, and he (<font color='blue'><b>Laurence</b></font>) brought her (<font color='blue'><b>Mother</b></font>) back, and we talked over the
fence, and were getting on capitally, all about cricket, and so on,
when he (<font color='blue'><b>Laurence</b></font>) saw Meg coming, and walked off. I mean to know him (<font color='blue'><b>Laurence</b></font>) some day,
for he (<font color='blue'><b>Laurence</b></font>) needs fun, I'm sure he (<font color='blue'><b>Laurence</b></font>) does,''  (<font color='red'><b>Jo/Miss Jo/JO</b></font>)</div>said Jo decidedly.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``I like his (<font color='blue'><b>Laurence</b></font>) manners, and he (<font color='blue'><b>Laurence</b></font>) looks like a little gentleman, so I've no
objection to your knowing him (<font color='blue'><b>Laurence</b></font>), if a proper opportunity comes. He (<font color='blue'><b>Laurence</b></font>)
brought the flowers himself, and I should have asked him (<font color='blue'><b>Laurence</b></font>) in, if I had
been sure what was going on upstairs. He (<font color='blue'><b>Laurence</b></font>) looked so wistful as he (<font color='blue'><b>Laurence</b></font>) went
away, hearing the frolic and evidently having none of his (<font color='blue'><b>Laurence</b></font>) own.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``It's a mercy you didn't, Mother!''  (<font color='red'><b>Jo/Miss Jo/JO</b></font>)</div>laughed Jo, looking at her (<font color='blue'><b>Jo</b></font>) boots.
<div class="bookquote">``But we'll have another play sometime that he (<font color='blue'><b>Laurence</b></font>) can see. Perhaps he (<font color='blue'><b>Laurence</b></font>)'ll
help act. Wouldn't that be jolly?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I never had such a fine bouquet before! How pretty it is!''  (<font color='red'><b>Meg</b></font>)</div>And Meg
examined her (<font color='blue'><b>Meg</b></font>) flowers with great interest.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``They are lovely. But Beth's roses are sweeter to me,''  (<font color='red'><b>Beth</b></font>)</div>said Mrs.
March, smelling the half-dead posy in her (<font color='blue'><b>Meg</b></font>) belt.

<p/>Beth nestled up to her (<font color='blue'><b>Beth</b></font>), and whispered softly, <div class="bookquote">``I wish I could send my
bunch to Father. I'm afraid he (<font color='blue'><b>Father</b></font>) isn't having such a merry Christmas as
we are.''



 (<font color='red'><b>her</b></font>)</div><p/>CHAPTER THREE

<p/>THE LAURENCE BOY

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Jo! Jo! Where are you?''  (<font color='red'><b>THE LAURENCE BOY Jo</b></font>)</div>cried Meg at the foot of the garret stairs.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Here!''  (<font color='red'><b>Meg</b></font>)</div>answered a husky voice from above, and, running up, Meg found
her (<font color='blue'><b>Meg</b></font>) sister eating apples and crying over the Heir of Redclyffe, wrapped
up in a comforter on an old three-legged sofa by the sunny window.
This was Jo's favorite refuge, and here she (<font color='blue'><b>Jo</b></font>) loved to retire with half a
dozen russets and a nice book, to enjoy the quiet and the society of a
pet rat who lived near by and didn't mind her (<font color='blue'><b>Jo</b></font>) a particle. As Meg
appeared, Scrabble whisked into his (<font color='blue'><b>Heir</b></font>) hole. Jo shook the tears off her (<font color='blue'><b>Jo</b></font>)
cheeks and waited to hear the news.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Such fun! Only see! A regular note of invitation from Mrs. Gardiner
for tomorrow night!''  (<font color='red'><b>Meg</b></font>)</div>cried Meg, waving the precious paper and then
proceeding to read it with girlish delight.

<p/><div class="bookquote">''`Mrs. Gardiner would be happy to see Miss March and Miss Josephine at
a little dance on New Year's Eve.''  (<font color='red'><b>Meg</b></font>)</div>Marmee is willing we should go, now
what shall we wear?''

<p/><div class="bookquote">``What's the use of asking that, when you know we shall wear our
poplins, because we haven't got anything else?''  (<font color='red'><b>Jo/Miss Jo/JO</b></font>)</div>answered Jo with her (<font color='blue'><b>Jo</b></font>)
mouth full.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``If I only had a silk!''  (<font color='red'><b>Meg</b></font>)</div>sighed Meg. <div class="bookquote">``Mother says I may when I'm
eighteen perhaps, but two years is an everlasting time to wait.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I'm sure our pops look like silk, and they are nice enough for us.
Yours is as good as new, but I forgot the burn and the tear in mine.
Whatever shall I do? The burn shows badly, and I can't take any out.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``You must sit still all you can and keep your back out of sight. The
front is all right. I shall have a new ribbon for my hair, and Marmee
will lend me her (<font color='blue'><b>I</b></font>) little pearl pin, and my new slippers are lovely, and
my gloves will do, though they aren't as nice as I'd like.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Mine are spoiled with lemonade, and I can't get any new ones, so I
shall have to go without,''  (<font color='red'><b>Jo/Miss Jo/JO</b></font>)</div>said Jo, who never troubled herself much
about dress.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``You must have gloves, or I won't go,''  (<font color='red'><b>Meg</b></font>)</div>cried Meg decidedly. <div class="bookquote">``Gloves are
more important than anything else. You can't dance without them, and
if you don't I should be so mortified.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Then I'll stay still. I don't care much for company dancing. It's no
fun to go sailing round. I like to fly about and cut capers.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``You can't ask Mother for new ones, they are so expensive, and you are
so careless. She (<font color='blue'><b>Mother</b></font>) said when you spoiled the others that she (<font color='blue'><b>Mother</b></font>) shouldn't
get you any more this winter. Can't you make them do?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I can hold them crumpled up in my hand, so no one will know how
stained they are. That's all I can do. No! I'll tell you how we can
manage, each wear one good one and carry a bad one. Don't you see?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Your hands are bigger than mine, and you will stretch my glove
dreadfully,''  (<font color='red'><b>Meg</b></font>)</div>began Meg, whose gloves were a tender point with her (<font color='blue'><b>Meg</b></font>).

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Then I'll go without. I don't care what people say!''  (<font color='red'><b>Jo/Miss Jo/JO</b></font>)</div>cried Jo, taking
up her (<font color='blue'><b>Jo</b></font>) book.

<p/>``You may have it, you may! Only don't stain it, and do behave nicely.
Don't put your hands behind you, or stare, or say ``Christopher
Columbus!<div class="bookquote">'' will you?''

 (<font color='red'><b>Christopher Columbus</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Don't worry about me. I'll be as prim as I can and not get into any
scrapes, if I can help it. Now go and answer your note, and let me
finish this splendid story.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Meg</b></font>)</div><p/>So Meg went away to `accept with thanks', look over her (<font color='blue'><b>Meg</b></font>) dress, and sing
blithely as she (<font color='blue'><b>Meg</b></font>) did up her (<font color='blue'><b>Meg</b></font>) one real lace frill, while Jo finished her (<font color='blue'><b>Jo</b></font>)
story, her (<font color='blue'><b>Jo</b></font>) four apples, and had a game of romps with Scrabble.

<p/>On New Year's Eve the parlor was deserted, for the two younger girls
played dressing maids and the two elder were absorbed in the
all-important business of `getting ready for the party'. Simple as the
toilets were, there was a great deal of running up and down, laughing
and talking, and at one time a strong smell of burned hair pervaded the
house. Meg wanted a few curls about her (<font color='blue'><b>Meg</b></font>) face, and Jo undertook to
pinch the papered locks with a pair of hot tongs.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Ought they to smoke like that?''  (<font color='red'><b>Beth</b></font>)</div>asked Beth from her (<font color='blue'><b>Jo</b></font>) perch on the bed.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``It's the dampness drying,''  (<font color='red'><b>Jo/Miss Jo/JO</b></font>)</div>replied Jo.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``What a queer smell! It's like burned feathers,''  (<font color='red'><b>Amy/Amy March</b></font>)</div>observed Amy,
smoothing her (<font color='blue'><b>Jo</b></font>) own pretty curls with a superior air.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``There, now I'll take off the papers and you'll see a cloud of little
ringlets,''  (<font color='red'><b>Jo/Miss Jo/JO</b></font>)</div>said Jo, putting down the tongs.

<p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>Jo</b></font>) did take off the papers, but no cloud of ringlets appeared, for the
hair came with the papers, and the horrified hairdresser laid a row of
little scorched bundles on the bureau before her (<font color='blue'><b>hairdresser</b></font>) victim.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Oh, oh, oh! What have you done? I'm spoiled! I can't go! My hair,
oh, my hair!''  (<font color='red'><b>Meg</b></font>)</div>wailed Meg, looking with despair at the uneven frizzle on
her (<font color='blue'><b>Meg</b></font>) forehead.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Just my luck! You shouldn't have asked me to do it. I always spoil
everything. I'm so sorry, but the tongs were too hot, and so I've made
a mess,''  (<font color='red'><b>Jo/Miss Jo/JO</b></font>)</div>groaned poor Jo, regarding the little black pancakes with
tears of regret.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``It isn't spoiled. Just frizzle it, and tie your ribbon so the ends
come on your forehead a bit, and it will look like the last fashion.
I've seen many girls do it so,''  (<font color='red'><b>Amy/Amy March</b></font>)</div>said Amy consolingly.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Serves me right for trying to be fine. I wish I'd let my hair alone,''
 (<font color='red'><b>Meg</b></font>)</div>cried Meg petulantly.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``So do I, it was so smooth and pretty. But it will soon grow out
again,''  (<font color='red'><b>Beth</b></font>)</div>said Beth, coming to kiss and comfort the shorn sheep.

<p/>After various lesser mishaps, Meg was finished at last, and by the
united exertions of the entire family Jo's hair was got up and her (<font color='blue'><b>Jo</b></font>)
dress on. They looked very well in their simple suits, Meg's in
silvery drab, with a blue velvet snood, lace frills, and the pearl pin.
Jo in maroon, with a stiff, gentlemanly linen collar, and a white
chrysanthemum or two for her (<font color='blue'><b>Jo</b></font>) only ornament. Each put on one nice light
glove, and carried one soiled one, and all pronounced the effect <div class="bookquote">``quite
easy and fine'' (<font color='red'><b>Meg</b></font>)</div>. Meg's high-heeled slippers were very tight and hurt
her (<font color='blue'><b>Meg</b></font>), though she (<font color='blue'><b>Meg</b></font>) would not own it, and Jo's nineteen hairpins all seemed
stuck straight into her (<font color='blue'><b>Jo</b></font>) head, which was not exactly comfortable, but,
dear me, let us be elegant or die.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Have a good time, dearies!''  (<font color='red'><b>the sisters</b></font>)</div>said Mrs. March, as the sisters went
daintily down the walk. <div class="bookquote">``Don't eat much supper, and come away at
eleven when I send Hannah for you.''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>As the gate clashed behind them, a
voice cried from a window...

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Girls, girls! Have you you both got nice pocket handkerchiefs?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Yes, yes, spandy nice, and Meg has cologne on hers,''  (<font color='red'><b>Jo/Miss Jo/JO</b></font>)</div>cried Jo, adding
with a laugh as they went on, <div class="bookquote">``I do believe Marmee would ask that if we
were all running away from an earthquake.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Jo/Miss Jo/JO</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``It is one of her (<font color='blue'><b>Meg</b></font>) aristocratic tastes, and quite proper, for a real
lady is always known by neat boots, gloves, and handkerchief,''  (<font color='red'><b>Meg</b></font>)</div>replied
Meg, who had a good many little `aristocratic tastes' of her (<font color='blue'><b>Meg</b></font>) own.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Now don't forget to keep the bad breadth out of sight, Jo. Is my sash
right? And does my hair look very bad?''  (<font color='red'><b>Meg</b></font>)</div>said Meg, as she (<font color='blue'><b>Meg</b></font>) turned from
the glass in Mrs. Gardiner's dressing room after a prolonged prink.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``I know I shall forget. If you see me doing anything wrong, just
remind me by a wink, will you?''  (<font color='red'><b>Jo/Miss Jo/JO</b></font>)</div>returned Jo, giving her (<font color='blue'><b>Jo</b></font>) collar a twitch
and her (<font color='blue'><b>Jo</b></font>) head a hasty brush.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``No, winking isn't ladylike. I'll lift my eyebrows if any thing is
wrong, and nod if you are all right. Now hold your shoulder straight,
and take short steps, and don't shake hands if you are introduced to
anyone. It isn't the thing.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``How do you learn all the proper ways? I never can. Isn't that music
gay?''

 (<font color='red'><b>parties</b></font>)</div><p/>Down they went, feeling a trifle timid, for they seldom went to
parties, and informal as this little gathering was, it was an event to
them. Mrs. Gardiner, a stately old lady, greeted them kindly and
handed them over to the eldest of her (<font color='blue'><b>Gardiner</b></font>) six daughters. Meg knew Sallie
and was at her (<font color='blue'><b>Meg</b></font>) ease very soon, but Jo, who didn't care much for girls
or girlish gossip, stood about, with her (<font color='blue'><b>Jo</b></font>) back carefully against the
wall, and felt as much out of place as a colt in a flower garden. Half
a dozen jovial lads were talking about skates in another part of the
room, and she (<font color='blue'><b>Jo</b></font>) longed to go and join them, for skating was one of the
joys of her (<font color='blue'><b>Jo</b></font>) life. She (<font color='blue'><b>Jo</b></font>) telegraphed her (<font color='blue'><b>Jo</b></font>) wish to Meg, but the eyebrows
went up so alarmingly that she (<font color='blue'><b>Meg</b></font>) dared not stir. No one came to talk to
her (<font color='blue'><b>Meg</b></font>), and one by one the group dwindled away till she (<font color='blue'><b>Meg</b></font>) was left alone.
She (<font color='blue'><b>Meg</b></font>) could not roam about and amuse herself, for the burned breadth
would show, so she (<font color='blue'><b>Meg</b></font>) stared at people rather forlornly till the dancing
began. Meg was asked at once, and the tight slippers tripped about so
briskly that none would have guessed the pain their wearer suffered
smilingly. Jo saw a big red headed youth approaching her (<font color='blue'><b>Jo</b></font>) corner, and
fearing he (<font color='blue'><b>Meg</b></font>) meant to engage her (<font color='blue'><b>Jo</b></font>), she (<font color='blue'><b>Jo</b></font>) slipped into a curtained recess,
intending to peep and enjoy herself in peace. Unfortunately, another
bashful person had chosen the same refuge, for, as the curtain fell
behind her (<font color='blue'><b>Jo</b></font>), she (<font color='blue'><b>Jo</b></font>) found herself face to face with the ``Laurence boy'.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Dear me, I didn't know anyone was here!''  (<font color='red'><b>Jo/Miss Jo/JO</b></font>)</div>stammered Jo, preparing to
back out as speedily as she (<font color='blue'><b>Jo</b></font>) had bounced in.

<p/>But the boy laughed and said pleasantly, though he (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>) looked a little
startled, <div class="bookquote">``Don't mind me, stay if you like.''

 (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Shan't I disturb you?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Not a bit. I only came here because I don't know many people and felt
rather strange at first, you know.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``So did I. Don't go away, please, unless you'd rather.''

 (<font color='red'><b>The boy</b></font>)</div><p/>The boy sat down again and looked at his (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>) pumps, till Jo said, trying to
be polite and easy, <div class="bookquote">``I think I've had the pleasure of seeing you
before. You live near us, don't you?''

 (<font color='red'><b>Jo/Miss Jo/JO</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Next door.''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>And he (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>) looked up and laughed outright, for Jo's prim
manner was rather funny when he (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>) remembered how they had chatted about
cricket when he (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>) brought the cat home.

<p/>That put Jo at her (<font color='blue'><b>Jo</b></font>) ease and she (<font color='blue'><b>Jo</b></font>) laughed too, as she (<font color='blue'><b>Jo</b></font>) said, in her (<font color='blue'><b>Jo</b></font>)
heartiest way, <div class="bookquote">``We did have such a good time over your nice Christmas
present.''

 (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Grandpa sent it.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``But you put it into his (<font color='blue'><b>Grandpa</b></font>) head, didn't you, now?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``How is your cat, Miss March?''  (<font color='red'><b>the boy</b></font>)</div>asked the boy, trying to look sober
while his (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>) black eyes shone with fun.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Nicely, thank you, Mr. Laurence. But I am not Miss March, I'm only
Jo,''  (<font color='red'><b>the lady</b></font>)</div>returned the young lady.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``I'm not Mr. Laurence, I'm only Laurie.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Laurie Laurence, what an odd name.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``My first name is Theodore, but I don't like it, for the fellows called
me Dora, so I made them say Laurie instead.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I hate my name, too, so sentimental! I wish every one would say Jo
instead of Josephine. How did you make the boys stop calling you Dora?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I thrashed 'em.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I can't thrash Aunt March, so I suppose I shall have to bear it.''  (<font color='red'><b>Jo/Miss Jo/JO</b></font>)</div>And
Jo resigned herself with a sigh.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Don't you like to dance, Miss Jo?''  (<font color='red'><b>Laurie/Mr. Laurie/LAURIE</b></font>)</div>asked Laurie, looking as if he (<font color='blue'><b>Laurie</b></font>)
thought the name suited her (<font color='blue'><b>Jo</b></font>).

<p/><div class="bookquote">``I like it well enough if there is plenty of room, and everyone is
lively. In a place like this I'm sure to upset something, tread on
people's toes, or do something dreadful, so I keep out of mischief and
let Meg sail about. Don't you dance?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Sometimes. You see I've been abroad a good many years, and haven't
been into company enough yet to know how you do things here.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Abroad!''  (<font color='red'><b>Jo/Miss Jo/JO</b></font>)</div>cried Jo. <div class="bookquote">``Oh, tell me about it! I love dearly to hear
people describe their travels.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Laurie/Mr. Laurie/LAURIE</b></font>)</div><p/>Laurie didn't seem to know where to begin, but Jo's eager questions
soon set him (<font color='blue'><b>Laurie</b></font>) going, and he (<font color='blue'><b>Laurie</b></font>) told her (<font color='blue'><b>Jo</b></font>) how he (<font color='blue'><b>Laurie</b></font>) had been at school in Vevay,
where the boys never wore hats and had a fleet of boats on the lake,
and for holiday fun went on walking trips about Switzerland with their
teachers.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Don't I wish I'd been there!''  (<font color='red'><b>Jo/Miss Jo/JO</b></font>)</div>cried Jo. <div class="bookquote">``Did you go to Paris?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``We spent last winter there.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Can you talk French?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``We were not allowed to speak anything else at Vevay.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Do say some! I can read it, but can't pronounce.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Quel nom a cette jeune demoiselle en les pantoufles jolis?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/>``How nicely you do it! Let me see ... you said, <div class="bookquote">``Who is the young lady
in the pretty slippers', didn't you?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Oui, mademoiselle.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``It's my sister Margaret, and you knew it was! Do you think she (<font color='blue'><b>Margaret</b></font>) is
pretty?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Yes, she (<font color='blue'><b>Margaret</b></font>) makes me think of the German girls, she (<font color='blue'><b>Margaret</b></font>) looks so fresh and
quiet, and dances like a lady.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Jo/Miss Jo/JO</b></font>)</div><p/>Jo quite glowed with pleasure at this boyish praise of her (<font color='blue'><b>Jo</b></font>) sister, and
stored it up to repeat to Meg. Both peeped and criticized and chatted
till they felt like old acquaintances. Laurie's bashfulness soon wore
off, for Jo's gentlemanly demeanor amused and set him (<font color='blue'><b>Laurie</b></font>) at his (<font color='blue'><b>Laurie</b></font>) ease, and
Jo was her (<font color='blue'><b>Jo</b></font>) merry self again, because her (<font color='blue'><b>Jo</b></font>) dress was forgotten and nobody
lifted their eyebrows at her (<font color='blue'><b>Jo</b></font>). She (<font color='blue'><b>Jo</b></font>) liked the ``Laurence boy' better than
ever and took several good looks at him (<font color='blue'><b>Laurence</b></font>), so that she (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) might describe him (<font color='blue'><b>Laurence</b></font>)
to the girls, for they had no brothers, very few male cousins, and boys
were almost unknown creatures to them.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Curly black hair, brown skin, big black eyes, handsome nose, fine
teeth, small hands and feet, taller than I am, very polite, for a boy,
and altogether jolly. Wonder how old he (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>) is?''

 (<font color='red'><b>Jo/Miss Jo/JO</b></font>)</div><p/>It was on the tip of Jo's tongue to ask, but she (<font color='blue'><b>Jo</b></font>) checked herself in
time and, with unusual tact, tried to find out in a round-about way.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``I suppose you are going to college soon? I see you pegging away at
your books, no, I mean studying hard.''  (<font color='red'><b>Jo/Miss Jo/JO</b></font>)</div>And Jo blushed at the dreadful
`pegging' which had escaped her (<font color='blue'><b>Jo</b></font>).

<p/>Laurie smiled but didn't seem shocked, and answered with a shrug. <div class="bookquote">``Not
for a year or two. I won't go before seventeen, anyway.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Aren't you but fifteen?''  (<font color='red'><b>Jo/Miss Jo/JO</b></font>)</div>asked Jo, looking at the tall lad, whom she (<font color='blue'><b>Jo</b></font>)
had imagined seventeen already.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Sixteen, next month.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``How I wish I was going to college! You don't look as if you liked it.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I hate it! Nothing but grinding or skylarking. And I don't like the
way fellows do either, in this country.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``What do you like?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``To live in Italy, and to enjoy myself in my own way.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Jo/Miss Jo/JO</b></font>)</div><p/>Jo wanted very much to ask what his (<font color='blue'><b>lad</b></font>) own way was, but his (<font color='blue'><b>lad</b></font>) black brows
looked rather threatening as he (<font color='blue'><b>lad</b></font>) knit them, so she (<font color='blue'><b>Jo</b></font>) changed the subject
by saying, as her (<font color='blue'><b>Jo</b></font>) foot kept time, <div class="bookquote">``That's a splendid polka! Why don't
you go and try it?''

 (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``If you will come too,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>lad</b></font>) answered, with a gallant little bow.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``I can't, for I told Meg I wouldn't, because...''  (<font color='red'><b>Jo/Miss Jo/JO</b></font>)</div>There Jo stopped, and
looked undecided whether to tell or to laugh.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Because, what?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``You won't tell?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Never!''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Well, I have a bad trick of standing before the fire, and so I burn my
frocks, and I scorched this one, and though it's nicely mended, it
shows, and Meg told me to keep still so no one would see it. You may
laugh, if you want to. It is funny, I know.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Laurie/Mr. Laurie/LAURIE</b></font>)</div><p/>But Laurie didn't laugh. He (<font color='blue'><b>Laurie</b></font>) only looked down a minute, and the
expression of his (<font color='blue'><b>Laurie</b></font>) face puzzled Jo when he (<font color='blue'><b>Laurie</b></font>) said very gently, <div class="bookquote">``Never mind
that. I'll tell you how we can manage. There's a long hall out there,
and we can dance grandly, and no one will see us. Please come.''

 (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div><p/>Jo thanked him (<font color='blue'><b>Laurie</b></font>) and gladly went, wishing she (<font color='blue'><b>Jo</b></font>) had two neat gloves when
she (<font color='blue'><b>Jo</b></font>) saw the nice, pearl-colored ones her (<font color='blue'><b>Jo</b></font>) partner wore. The hall was
empty, and they had a grand polka, for Laurie danced well, and taught
her (<font color='blue'><b>Jo</b></font>) the German step, which delighted Jo, being full of swing and
spring. When the music stopped, they sat down on the stairs to get
their breath, and Laurie was in the midst of an account of a students'
festival at Heidelberg when Meg appeared in search of her (<font color='blue'><b>Meg</b></font>) sister. She (<font color='blue'><b>Meg</b></font>)
beckoned, and Jo reluctantly followed her (<font color='blue'><b>Jo</b></font>) into a side room, where she (<font color='blue'><b>Jo</b></font>)
found her (<font color='blue'><b>Jo</b></font>) on a sofa, holding her (<font color='blue'><b>Jo</b></font>) foot, and looking pale.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``I've sprained my ankle. That stupid high heel turned and gave me a
sad wrench. It aches so, I can hardly stand, and I don't know how I'm
ever going to get home,''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Jo</b></font>) said, rocking to and fro in pain.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``I knew you'd hurt your feet with those silly shoes. I'm sorry. But I
don't see what you can do, except get a carriage, or stay here all
night,''  (<font color='red'><b>Jo/Miss Jo/JO</b></font>)</div>answered Jo, softly rubbing the poor ankle as she (<font color='blue'><b>Jo</b></font>) spoke.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``I can't have a carriage without its costing ever so much. I dare say
I can't get one at all, for most people come in their own, and it's a
long way to the stable, and no one to send.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I'll go.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``No, indeed! It's past nine, and dark as Egypt. I can't stop here,
for the house is full. Sallie has some girls staying with her (<font color='blue'><b>Sallie</b></font>). I'll
rest till Hannah comes, and then do the best I can.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I'll ask Laurie. He (<font color='blue'><b>Laurie</b></font>) will go,''  (<font color='red'><b>Jo/Miss Jo/JO</b></font>)</div>said Jo, looking relieved as the idea
occurred to her (<font color='blue'><b>Jo</b></font>).

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Mercy, no! Don't ask or tell anyone. Get me my rubbers, and put
these slippers with our things. I can't dance anymore, but as soon as
supper is over, watch for Hannah and tell me the minute she (<font color='blue'><b>Hannah</b></font>) comes.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``They are going out to supper now. I'll stay with you. I'd rather.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``No, dear, run along, and bring me some coffee. I'm so tired I can't
stir.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Meg</b></font>)</div><p/>So Meg reclined, with rubbers well hidden, and Jo went blundering away
to the dining room, which she (<font color='blue'><b>Jo</b></font>) found after going into a china closet,
and opening the door of a room where old Mr. Gardiner was taking a
little private refreshment. Making a dart at the table, she (<font color='blue'><b>Jo</b></font>) secured
the coffee, which she (<font color='blue'><b>Jo</b></font>) immediately spilled, thereby making the front of
her (<font color='blue'><b>Jo</b></font>) dress as bad as the back.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Oh, dear, what a blunderbuss I am!''  (<font color='red'><b>Jo/Miss Jo/JO</b></font>)</div>exclaimed Jo, finishing Meg's
glove by scrubbing her (<font color='blue'><b>Jo</b></font>) gown with it.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Can I help you?''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>said a friendly voice. And there was Laurie, with a
full cup in one hand and a plate of ice in the other.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``I was trying to get something for Meg, who is very tired, and someone
shook me, and here I am in a nice state,''  (<font color='red'><b>Jo/Miss Jo/JO</b></font>)</div>answered Jo, glancing
dismally from the stained skirt to the coffee-colored glove.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Too bad! I was looking for someone to give this to. May I take it
to your sister?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Oh, thank you! I'll show you where she (<font color='blue'><b>sister</b></font>) is. I don't offer to take it
myself, for I should only get into another scrape if I did.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Jo/Miss Jo/JO</b></font>)</div><p/>Jo led the way, and as if used to waiting on ladies, Laurie drew up a
little table, brought a second installment of coffee and ice for Jo,
and was so obliging that even particular Meg pronounced him (<font color='blue'><b>Laurie</b></font>) a `nice
boy'. They had a merry time over the bonbons and mottoes, and were in
the midst of a quiet game of _Buzz_, with two or three other young
people who had strayed in, when Hannah appeared. Meg forgot her (<font color='blue'><b>Meg</b></font>) foot
and rose so quickly that she (<font color='blue'><b>Meg</b></font>) was forced to catch hold of Jo, with an
exclamation of pain.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Hush! Don't say anything,''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Jo</b></font>) whispered, adding aloud, <div class="bookquote">``It's
nothing. I turned my foot a little, that's all,''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>and limped upstairs
to put her (<font color='blue'><b>Jo</b></font>) things on.

<p/>Hannah scolded, Meg cried, and Jo was at her (<font color='blue'><b>Jo</b></font>) wits' end, till she (<font color='blue'><b>Jo</b></font>)
decided to take things into her (<font color='blue'><b>Jo</b></font>) own hands. Slipping out, she (<font color='blue'><b>Jo</b></font>) ran down
and, finding a servant, asked if he (<font color='blue'><b>servant</b></font>) could get her (<font color='blue'><b>Jo</b></font>) a carriage. It
happened to be a hired waiter who knew nothing about the neighborhood
and Jo was looking round for help when Laurie, who had heard what she (<font color='blue'><b>Jo</b></font>)
said, came up and offered his (<font color='blue'><b>Laurie</b></font>) grandfather's carriage, which had just
come for him (<font color='blue'><b>Laurie</b></font>), he (<font color='blue'><b>Laurie</b></font>) said.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``It's so early! You can't mean to go yet?''  (<font color='red'><b>Jo/Miss Jo/JO</b></font>)</div>began Jo, looking relieved
but hesitating to accept the offer.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``I always go early, I do, truly! Please let me take you home. It's all
on my way, you know, and it rains, they say.''

 (<font color='red'><b>him</b></font>)</div><p/>That settled it, and telling him (<font color='blue'><b>Laurie</b></font>) of Meg's mishap, Jo gratefully
accepted and rushed up to bring down the rest of the party. Hannah
hated rain as much as a cat does so she (<font color='blue'><b>Hannah</b></font>) made no trouble, and they
rolled away in the luxurious close carriage, feeling very festive and
elegant. Laurie went on the box so Meg could keep her (<font color='blue'><b>Meg</b></font>) foot up, and the
girls talked over their party in freedom.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``I had a capital time. Did you?''  (<font color='red'><b>Jo/Miss Jo/JO</b></font>)</div>asked Jo, rumpling up her (<font color='blue'><b>Jo</b></font>) hair, and
making herself comfortable.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Yes, till I hurt myself. Sallie's friend, Annie Moffat, took a fancy
to me, and asked me to come and spend a week with her (<font color='blue'><b>Moffat</b></font>) when Sallie does.
She (<font color='blue'><b>Sallie</b></font>) is going in the spring when the opera comes, and it will be
perfectly splendid, if Mother only lets me go,''  (<font color='red'><b>Meg</b></font>)</div>answered Meg, cheering
up at the thought.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``I saw you dancing with the red headed man I ran away from. Was he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>)
nice?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Oh, very! His (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) hair is auburn, not red, and he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) was very polite, and I
had a delicious redowa with him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>).''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``He (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) looked like a grasshopper in a fit when he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) did the new step. Laurie
and I couldn't help laughing. Did you hear us?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``No, but it was very rude. What were you about all that time, hidden
away there?''

 (<font color='red'><b>Jo/Miss Jo/JO</b></font>)</div><p/>Jo told her (<font color='blue'><b>Jo</b></font>) adventures, and by the time she (<font color='blue'><b>Jo</b></font>) had finished they were at
home. With many thanks, they said good night and crept in, hoping to
disturb no one, but the instant their door creaked, two little
nightcaps bobbed up, and two sleepy but eager voices cried out...

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Tell about the party! Tell about the party!''

 (<font color='red'><b>Meg</b></font>)</div><p/>With what Meg called 'a great want of manners' Jo had saved some
bonbons for the little girls, and they soon subsided, after hearing the
most thrilling events of the evening.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``I declare, it really seems like being a fine young lady, to come home
from the party in a carriage and sit in my dressing gown with a maid to
wait on me,''  (<font color='red'><b>Meg</b></font>)</div>said Meg, as Jo bound up her (<font color='blue'><b>Jo</b></font>) foot with arnica and brushed
her (<font color='blue'><b>Jo</b></font>) hair.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``I don't believe fine young ladies enjoy themselves a bit more than we
do, in spite of our burned hair, old gowns, one glove apiece and tight
slippers that sprain our ankles when we are silly enough to wear them.''
 (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div>And I think Jo was quite right.



<p/>CHAPTER FOUR

<p/>BURDENS

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Oh, dear, how hard it does seem to take up our packs and go on,''
 (<font color='red'><b>Meg</b></font>)</div>sighed Meg the morning after the party, for now the holidays were over,
the week of merrymaking did not fit her (<font color='blue'><b>Meg</b></font>) for going on easily with the
task she (<font color='blue'><b>Meg</b></font>) never liked.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``I wish it was Christmas or New Year's all the time. Wouldn't it be
fun?''  (<font color='red'><b>Jo/Miss Jo/JO</b></font>)</div>answered Jo, yawning dismally.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``We shouldn't enjoy ourselves half so much as we do now. But it does
seem so nice to have little suppers and bouquets, and go to parties,
and drive home, and read and rest, and not work. It's like other
people, you know, and I always envy girls who do such things, I'm so
fond of luxury,''  (<font color='red'><b>Meg</b></font>)</div>said Meg, trying to decide which of two shabby gowns
was the least shabby.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Well, we can't have it, so don't let us grumble but shoulder our
bundles and trudge along as cheerfully as Marmee does. I'm sure Aunt
March is a regular Old Man of the Sea to me, but I suppose when I've
learned to carry her (<font color='blue'><b>Aunt</b></font>) without complaining, she (<font color='blue'><b>Aunt</b></font>) will tumble off, or get
so light that I shan't mind her (<font color='blue'><b>Aunt</b></font>).''

 (<font color='red'><b>Jo/Miss Jo/JO</b></font>)</div><p/>This idea tickled Jo's fancy and put her (<font color='blue'><b>Jo</b></font>) in good spirits, but Meg
didn't brighten, for her (<font color='blue'><b>Meg</b></font>) burden, consisting of four spoiled children,
seemed heavier than ever. She (<font color='blue'><b>Meg</b></font>) had not heart enough even to make herself
pretty as usual by putting on a blue neck ribbon and dressing her (<font color='blue'><b>Meg</b></font>) hair
in the most becoming way.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Where's the use of looking nice, when no one sees me but those cross
midgets, and no one cares whether I'm pretty or not?''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Meg</b></font>) muttered,
shutting her (<font color='blue'><b>Meg</b></font>) drawer with a jerk. <div class="bookquote">``I shall have to toil and moil all my
days, with only little bits of fun now and then, and get old and ugly
and sour, because I'm poor and can't enjoy my life as other girls do.
It's a shame!''

 (<font color='red'><b>Meg</b></font>)</div><p/>So Meg went down, wearing an injured look, and wasn't at all agreeable
at breakfast time. Everyone seemed rather out of sorts and inclined to
croak.

<p/>Beth had a headache and lay on the sofa, trying to comfort herself with
the cat and three kittens. Amy was fretting because her (<font color='blue'><b>Amy</b></font>) lessons were
not learned, and she (<font color='blue'><b>Amy</b></font>) couldn't find her (<font color='blue'><b>Amy</b></font>) rubbers. Jo would whistle and
make a great racket getting ready.

<p/>Mrs. March was very busy trying to finish a letter, which must go at
once, and Hannah had the grumps, for being up late didn't suit her (<font color='blue'><b>Hannah</b></font>).

<p/><div class="bookquote">``There never was such a cross family!''  (<font color='red'><b>Jo/Miss Jo/JO</b></font>)</div>cried Jo, losing her (<font color='blue'><b>Jo</b></font>) temper when
she (<font color='blue'><b>Jo</b></font>) had upset an inkstand, broken both boot lacings, and sat down upon
her (<font color='blue'><b>Jo</b></font>) hat.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``You're the crossest person in it!''  (<font color='red'><b>Amy/Amy March</b></font>)</div>returned Amy, washing out the sum
that was all wrong with the tears that had fallen on her (<font color='blue'><b>Jo</b></font>) slate.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Beth, if you don't keep these horrid cats down cellar I'll have them
drowned,''  (<font color='red'><b>Meg</b></font>)</div>exclaimed Meg angrily as she (<font color='blue'><b>Meg</b></font>) tried to get rid of the kitten
which had scrambled up her (<font color='blue'><b>Meg</b></font>) back and stuck like a burr just out of reach.

<p/>Jo laughed, Meg scolded, Beth implored, and Amy wailed because she (<font color='blue'><b>Amy</b></font>)
couldn't remember how much nine times twelve was.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Girls, girls, do be quiet one minute! I must get this off by the
early mail, and you drive me distracted with your worry,''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>cried Mrs.
March, crossing out the third spoiled sentence in her (<font color='blue'><b>Amy</b></font>) letter.

<p/>There was a momentary lull, broken by Hannah, who stalked in, laid two
hot turnovers on the table, and stalked out again. These turnovers were
an institution, and the girls called them `muffs', for they had no
others and found the hot pies very comforting to their hands on cold
mornings.

<p/>Hannah never forgot to make them, no matter how busy or grumpy she (<font color='blue'><b>Hannah</b></font>)
might be, for the walk was long and bleak. The poor things got no other
lunch and were seldom home before two.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Cuddle your cats and get over your headache, Bethy. Goodbye, Marmee.
We are a set of rascals this morning, but we'll come home regular
angels. Now then, Meg!''  (<font color='red'><b>Jo/Miss Jo/JO</b></font>)</div>And Jo tramped away, feeling that the
pilgrims were not setting out as they ought to do.

<p/>They always looked back before turning the corner, for their mother was
always at the window to nod and smile, and wave her (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) hand to them.
Somehow it seemed as if they couldn't have got through the day without
that, for whatever their mood might be, the last glimpse of that
motherly face was sure to affect them like sunshine.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``If Marmee shook her (<font color='blue'><b>Meg</b></font>) fist instead of kissing her (<font color='blue'><b>Meg</b></font>) hand to us, it would
serve us right, for more ungrateful wretches than we are were never
seen,''  (<font color='red'><b>Jo/Miss Jo/JO</b></font>)</div>cried Jo, taking a remorseful satisfaction in the snowy walk and
bitter wind.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Don't use such dreadful expressions,''  (<font color='red'><b>Meg</b></font>)</div>replied Meg from the depths of
the veil in which she (<font color='blue'><b>Meg</b></font>) had shrouded herself like a nun sick of the world.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``I like good strong words that mean something,''  (<font color='red'><b>Jo/Miss Jo/JO</b></font>)</div>replied Jo, catching
her (<font color='blue'><b>Jo</b></font>) hat as it took a leap off her (<font color='blue'><b>Jo</b></font>) head preparatory to flying away
altogether.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Call yourself any names you like, but I am neither a rascal nor a
wretch and I don't choose to be called so.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``You're a blighted being, and decidedly cross today because you can't
sit in the lap of luxury all the time. Poor dear, just wait till I
make my fortune, and you shall revel in carriages and ice cream and
high-heeled slippers, and posies, and red-headed boys to dance with.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``How ridiculous you are, Jo!''  (<font color='red'><b>Meg</b></font>)</div>But Meg laughed at the nonsense and felt
better in spite of herself.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Lucky for you I am, for if I put on crushed airs and tried to be
dismal, as you do, we should be in a nice state. Thank goodness, I can
always find something funny to keep me up. Don't croak any more, but
come home jolly, there's a dear.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Jo/Miss Jo/JO</b></font>)</div><p/>Jo gave her (<font color='blue'><b>Jo</b></font>) sister an encouraging pat on the shoulder as they parted
for the day, each going a different way, each hugging her (<font color='blue'><b>Jo</b></font>) little warm
turnover, and each trying to be cheerful in spite of wintry weather,
hard work, and the unsatisfied desires of pleasure-loving youth.

<p/>When Mr. March lost his (<font color='blue'><b>March</b></font>) property in trying to help an unfortunate
friend, the two oldest girls begged to be allowed to do something
toward their own support, at least. Believing that they could not
begin too early to cultivate energy, industry, and independence, their
parents consented, and both fell to work with the hearty good will
which in spite of all obstacles is sure to succeed at last.

<p/>Margaret found a place as nursery governess and felt rich with her (<font color='blue'><b>Margaret</b></font>)
small salary. As she (<font color='blue'><b>Margaret</b></font>) said, she (<font color='blue'><b>Margaret</b></font>) was `fond of luxury', and her (<font color='blue'><b>Margaret</b></font>) chief
trouble was poverty. She (<font color='blue'><b>Margaret</b></font>) found it harder to bear than the others
because she (<font color='blue'><b>Margaret</b></font>) could remember a time when home was beautiful, life full of
ease and pleasure, and want of any kind unknown. She (<font color='blue'><b>Margaret</b></font>) tried not to be
envious or discontented, but it was very natural that the young girl
should long for pretty things, gay friends, accomplishments, and a
happy life. At the Kings' she (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) daily saw all she (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) wanted, for the
children's older sisters were just out, and Meg caught frequent
glimpses of dainty ball dresses and bouquets, heard lively gossip about
theaters, concerts, sleighing parties, and merrymakings of all kinds,
and saw money lavished on trifles which would have been so precious to
her (<font color='blue'><b>Meg</b></font>). Poor Meg seldom complained, but a sense of injustice made her (<font color='blue'><b>Meg</b></font>)
feel bitter toward everyone sometimes, for she (<font color='blue'><b>Meg</b></font>) had not yet learned to
know how rich she (<font color='blue'><b>Meg</b></font>) was in the blessings which alone can make life happy.

<p/>Jo happened to suit Aunt March, who was lame and needed an active
person to wait upon her (<font color='blue'><b>Jo</b></font>). The childless old lady had offered to adopt
one of the girls when the troubles came, and was much offended because
her (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) offer was declined. Other friends told the Marches that they had
lost all chance of being remembered in the rich old lady's will, but
the unworldly Marches only said...

<p/><div class="bookquote">``We can't give up our girls for a dozen fortunes. Rich or poor, we
will keep together and be happy in one another.''

 (<font color='red'><b>the lady</b></font>)</div><p/>The old lady wouldn't speak to them for a time, but happening to meet
Jo at a friend's, something in her (<font color='blue'><b>Jo</b></font>) comical face and blunt manners
struck the old lady's fancy, and she (<font color='blue'><b>Jo</b></font>) proposed to take her (<font color='blue'><b>Jo</b></font>) for a
companion. This did not suit Jo at all, but she (<font color='blue'><b>Jo</b></font>) accepted the place
since nothing better appeared and, to every one's surprise, got on
remarkably well with her (<font color='blue'><b>Jo</b></font>) irascible relative. There was an occasional
tempest, and once Jo marched home, declaring she (<font color='blue'><b>Jo</b></font>) couldn't bear it
longer, but Aunt March always cleared up quickly, and sent for her (<font color='blue'><b>Aunt</b></font>) to
come back again with such urgency that she (<font color='blue'><b>Aunt</b></font>) could not refuse, for in her (<font color='blue'><b>Aunt</b></font>)
heart she (<font color='blue'><b>Aunt</b></font>) rather liked the peppery old lady.

<p/>I suspect that the real attraction was a large library of fine books,
which was left to dust and spiders since Uncle March died. Jo
remembered the kind old gentleman, who used to let her (<font color='blue'><b>Jo</b></font>) build railroads
and bridges with his (<font color='blue'><b>gentleman</b></font>) big dictionaries, tell her (<font color='blue'><b>Jo</b></font>) stories about queer
pictures in his (<font color='blue'><b>gentleman</b></font>) Latin books, and buy her (<font color='blue'><b>Jo</b></font>) cards of gingerbread whenever
he (<font color='blue'><b>gentleman</b></font>) met her (<font color='blue'><b>Jo</b></font>) in the street. The dim, dusty room, with the busts staring
down from the tall bookcases, the cozy chairs, the globes, and best of
all, the wilderness of books in which she (<font color='blue'><b>Jo</b></font>) could wander where she (<font color='blue'><b>Jo</b></font>) liked,
made the library a region of bliss to her (<font color='blue'><b>Jo</b></font>).

<p/>The moment Aunt March took her (<font color='blue'><b>Aunt</b></font>) nap, or was busy with company, Jo
hurried to this quiet place, and curling herself up in the easy chair,
devoured poetry, romance, history, travels, and pictures like a regular
bookworm. But, like all happiness, it did not last long, for as sure
as she (<font color='blue'><b>Jo</b></font>) had just reached the heart of the story, the sweetest verse of a
song, or the most perilous adventure of her (<font color='blue'><b>Jo</b></font>) traveler, a shrill voice
called, <div class="bookquote">``Josy-phine! Josy-phine!''  (<font color='red'><b>traveler</b></font>)</div>and she (<font color='blue'><b>Jo</b></font>) had to leave her (<font color='blue'><b>Jo</b></font>) paradise to
wind yarn, wash the poodle, or read Belsham's Essays by the hour
together.

<p/>Jo's ambition was to do something very splendid. What it was, she (<font color='blue'><b>Jo</b></font>) had
no idea as yet, but left it for time to tell her (<font color='blue'><b>Jo</b></font>), and meanwhile, found
her (<font color='blue'><b>Jo</b></font>) greatest affliction in the fact that she (<font color='blue'><b>Jo</b></font>) couldn't read, run, and
ride as much as she (<font color='blue'><b>Jo</b></font>) liked. A quick temper, sharp tongue, and restless
spirit were always getting her (<font color='blue'><b>Jo</b></font>) into scrapes, and her (<font color='blue'><b>Jo</b></font>) life was a series
of ups and downs, which were both comic and pathetic. But the training
she (<font color='blue'><b>Jo</b></font>) received at Aunt March's was just what she (<font color='blue'><b>Jo</b></font>) needed, and the thought
that she (<font color='blue'><b>Jo</b></font>) was doing something to support herself made her (<font color='blue'><b>Jo</b></font>) happy in spite
of the perpetual <div class="bookquote">``Josy-phine!''

 (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div><p/>Beth was too bashful to go to school. It had been tried, but she (<font color='blue'><b>Beth</b></font>)
suffered so much that it was given up, and she (<font color='blue'><b>Beth</b></font>) did her (<font color='blue'><b>Beth</b></font>) lessons at home
with her (<font color='blue'><b>Beth</b></font>) father. Even when he (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) went away, and her (<font color='blue'><b>Beth</b></font>) mother was called to
devote her (<font color='blue'><b>Beth</b></font>) skill and energy to Soldiers' Aid Societies, Beth went
faithfully on by herself and did the best she (<font color='blue'><b>Beth</b></font>) could. She (<font color='blue'><b>Beth</b></font>) was a
housewifely little creature, and helped Hannah keep home neat and
comfortable for the workers, never thinking of any reward but to be
loved. Long, quiet days she (<font color='blue'><b>Hannah</b></font>) spent, not lonely nor idle, for her (<font color='blue'><b>Hannah</b></font>) little
world was peopled with imaginary friends, and she (<font color='blue'><b>Hannah</b></font>) was by nature a busy
bee. There were six dolls to be taken up and dressed every morning,
for Beth was a child still and loved her (<font color='blue'><b>Beth</b></font>) pets as well as ever. Not one
whole or handsome one among them, all were outcasts till Beth took them
in, for when her (<font color='blue'><b>Beth</b></font>) sisters outgrew these idols, they passed to her (<font color='blue'><b>Beth</b></font>)
because Amy would have nothing old or ugly. Beth cherished them all the
more tenderly for that very reason, and set up a hospital for infirm
dolls. No pins were ever stuck into their cotton vitals, no harsh
words or blows were ever given them, no neglect ever saddened the heart
of the most repulsive, but all were fed and clothed, nursed and
caressed with an affection which never failed. One forlorn fragment of
dollanity had belonged to Jo and, having led a tempestuous life, was
left a wreck in the rag bag, from which dreary poorhouse it was rescued
by Beth and taken to her (<font color='blue'><b>Beth</b></font>) refuge. Having no top to its head, she (<font color='blue'><b>Beth</b></font>) tied
on a neat little cap, and as both arms and legs were gone, she (<font color='blue'><b>Beth</b></font>) hid
these deficiencies by folding it in a blanket and devoting her (<font color='blue'><b>Beth</b></font>) best bed
to this chronic invalid. If anyone had known the care lavished on that
dolly, I think it would have touched their hearts, even while they
laughed. She (<font color='blue'><b>Beth</b></font>) brought it bits of bouquets, she (<font color='blue'><b>Beth</b></font>) read to it, took it out
to breathe fresh air, hidden under her (<font color='blue'><b>Beth</b></font>) coat, she (<font color='blue'><b>Beth</b></font>) sang it lullabies and
never went to bed without kissing its dirty face and whispering
tenderly, <div class="bookquote">``I hope you'll have a good night, my poor dear.''

 (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div><p/>Beth had her (<font color='blue'><b>Beth</b></font>) troubles as well as the others, and not being an angel but
a very human little girl, she (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) often `wept a little weep' as Jo said,
because she (<font color='blue'><b>Jo</b></font>) couldn't take music lessons and have a fine piano. She (<font color='blue'><b>Jo</b></font>)
loved music so dearly, tried so hard to learn, and practiced away so
patiently at the jingling old instrument, that it did seem as if
someone -LRB-not to hint Aunt March-RRB- ought to help her (<font color='blue'><b>Aunt</b></font>). Nobody did,
however, and nobody saw Beth wipe the tears off the yellow keys, that
wouldn't keep in tune, when she (<font color='blue'><b>Beth</b></font>) was all alone. She (<font color='blue'><b>Beth</b></font>) sang like a little
lark about her (<font color='blue'><b>Beth</b></font>) work, never was too tired for Marmee and the girls, and
day after day said hopefully to herself, <div class="bookquote">``I know I'll get my music some
time, if I'm good.''

 (<font color='red'><b>the girls</b></font>)</div><p/>There are many Beths in the world, shy and quiet, sitting in corners
till needed, and living for others so cheerfully that no one sees the
sacrifices till the little cricket on the hearth stops chirping, and
the sweet, sunshiny presence vanishes, leaving silence and shadow
behind.

<p/>If anybody had asked Amy what the greatest trial of her (<font color='blue'><b>Amy</b></font>) life was, she (<font color='blue'><b>Amy</b></font>)
would have answered at once, <div class="bookquote">``My nose.''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>When she (<font color='blue'><b>Amy</b></font>) was a baby, Jo had
accidently dropped her (<font color='blue'><b>Jo</b></font>) into the coal hod, and Amy insisted that the
fall had ruined her (<font color='blue'><b>Amy</b></font>) nose forever. It was not big nor red, like poor
``Petrea's', it was only rather flat, and all the pinching in the world
could not give it an aristocratic point. No one minded it but herself,
and it was doing its best to grow, but Amy felt deeply the want of a
Grecian nose, and drew whole sheets of handsome ones to console herself.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Little Raphael,''  (<font color='red'><b>sisters</b></font>)</div>as her (<font color='blue'><b>Amy</b></font>) sisters called her (<font color='blue'><b>Amy</b></font>), had a decided talent for
drawing, and was never so happy as when copying flowers, designing
fairies, or illustrating stories with queer specimens of art. Her (<font color='blue'><b>Amy</b></font>)
teachers complained that instead of doing her (<font color='blue'><b>Amy</b></font>) sums she (<font color='blue'><b>Amy</b></font>) covered her (<font color='blue'><b>Amy</b></font>)
slate with animals, the blank pages of her (<font color='blue'><b>Amy</b></font>) atlas were used to copy maps
on, and caricatures of the most ludicrous description came fluttering
out of all her (<font color='blue'><b>Amy</b></font>) books at unlucky moments. She (<font color='blue'><b>Amy</b></font>) got through her (<font color='blue'><b>Amy</b></font>) lessons
as well as she (<font color='blue'><b>Amy</b></font>) could, and managed to escape reprimands by being a model
of deportment. She (<font color='blue'><b>Amy</b></font>) was a great favorite with her (<font color='blue'><b>Amy</b></font>) mates, being
good-tempered and possessing the happy art of pleasing without effort.
Her (<font color='blue'><b>Amy</b></font>) little airs and graces were much admired, so were her (<font color='blue'><b>Amy</b></font>)
accomplishments, for besides her (<font color='blue'><b>Amy</b></font>) drawing, she (<font color='blue'><b>Amy</b></font>) could play twelve tunes,
crochet, and read French without mispronouncing more than two-thirds of
the words. She (<font color='blue'><b>Amy</b></font>) had a plaintive way of saying, <div class="bookquote">``When Papa was rich we
did so-and-so,''  (<font color='red'><b>She</b></font>)</div>which was very touching, and her (<font color='blue'><b>Amy</b></font>) long words were
considered `perfectly elegant' by the girls.

<p/>Amy was in a fair way to be spoiled, for everyone petted her (<font color='blue'><b>Amy</b></font>), and her (<font color='blue'><b>Amy</b></font>)
small vanities and selfishnesses were growing nicely. One thing,
however, rather quenched the vanities. She (<font color='blue'><b>Amy</b></font>) had to wear her (<font color='blue'><b>Amy</b></font>) cousin's
clothes. Now Florence's mama hadn't a particle of taste, and Amy
suffered deeply at having to wear a red instead of a blue bonnet,
unbecoming gowns, and fussy aprons that did not fit. Everything was
good, well made, and little worn, but Amy's artistic eyes were much
afflicted, especially this winter, when her (<font color='blue'><b>Amy</b></font>) school dress was a dull
purple with yellow dots and no trimming.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``My only comfort,''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Amy</b></font>) said to Meg, with tears in her (<font color='blue'><b>Amy</b></font>) eyes, <div class="bookquote">``is that
Mother doesn't take tucks in my dresses whenever I'm naughty, as Maria
Parks's mother does. My dear, it's really dreadful, for sometimes she (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>)
is so bad her (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) frock is up to her (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) knees, and she (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) can't come to school.
When I think of this _deggerredation_, I feel that I can bear even my
flat nose and purple gown with yellow sky-rockets on it.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Meg</b></font>)</div><p/>Meg was Amy's confidant and monitor, and by some strange attraction of
opposites Jo was gentle Beth's. To Jo alone did the shy child tell her (<font color='blue'><b>Jo</b></font>)
thoughts, and over her (<font color='blue'><b>Jo</b></font>) big harum-scarum sister Beth unconsciously
exercised more influence than anyone in the family. The two older
girls were a great deal to one another, but each took one of the
younger sisters into her (<font color='blue'><b>Jo</b></font>) keeping and watched over her (<font color='blue'><b>Jo</b></font>) in her (<font color='blue'><b>Jo</b></font>) own way,
`playing mother' they called it, and put their sisters in the places of
discarded dolls with the maternal instinct of little women.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Has anybody got anything to tell? It's been such a dismal day I'm
really dying for some amusement,''  (<font color='red'><b>Meg</b></font>)</div>said Meg, as they sat sewing together
that evening.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``I had a queer time with Aunt today, and, as I got the best of it, I'll
tell you about it,''  (<font color='red'><b>Jo/Miss Jo/JO</b></font>)</div>began Jo, who dearly loved to tell stories. <div class="bookquote">``I was
reading that everlasting Belsham, and droning away as I always do, for
Aunt soon drops off, and then I take out some nice book, and read like
fury till she (<font color='blue'><b>Aunt</b></font>) wakes up. I actually made myself sleepy, and before she (<font color='blue'><b>Aunt</b></font>)
began to nod, I gave such a gape that she (<font color='blue'><b>Aunt</b></font>) asked me what I meant by
opening my mouth wide enough to take the whole book in at once.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I wish I could, and be done with it,''  (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div>said I, trying not to be saucy.

<p/>``Then she (<font color='blue'><b>Aunt</b></font>) gave me a long lecture on my sins, and told me to sit and
think them over while she (<font color='blue'><b>Aunt</b></font>) just `lost' herself for a moment. She (<font color='blue'><b>Aunt</b></font>) never
finds herself very soon, so the minute her (<font color='blue'><b>Aunt</b></font>) cap began to bob like a
top-heavy dahlia, I whipped the _Vicar of Wakefield_ out of my pocket,
and read away, with one eye on him (<font color='blue'><b>Vicar</b></font>) and one on Aunt. I'd just got to
where they all tumbled into the water when I forgot and laughed out
loud. Aunt woke up and, being more good-natured after her (<font color='blue'><b>Aunt</b></font>) nap, told me
to read a bit and show what frivolous work I preferred to the worthy
and instructive Belsham. I did my very best, and she (<font color='blue'><b>Aunt</b></font>) liked it, though
she (<font color='blue'><b>Aunt</b></font>) only said...

<p/><div class="bookquote">'''I don't understand what it's all about. Go back and begin it,
child.'''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/>``Back I went, and made the Primroses as interesting as ever I could.
Once I was wicked enough to stop in a thrilling place, and say meekly,
<div class="bookquote">``I'm afraid it tires you, ma'am. Shan't I stop now?'''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/>``She (<font color='blue'><b>Aunt</b></font>) caught up her (<font color='blue'><b>Aunt</b></font>) knitting, which had dropped out of her (<font color='blue'><b>Aunt</b></font>) hands, gave
me a sharp look through her (<font color='blue'><b>Aunt</b></font>) specs, and said, in her (<font color='blue'><b>Aunt</b></font>) short way, <div class="bookquote">``Finish
the chapter, and don't be impertinent, miss'.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Did she (<font color='blue'><b>Aunt</b></font>) own she (<font color='blue'><b>Aunt</b></font>) liked it?''  (<font color='red'><b>Meg</b></font>)</div>asked Meg.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Oh, bless you, no! But she (<font color='blue'><b>Aunt</b></font>) let old Belsham rest, and when I ran back
after my gloves this afternoon, there she (<font color='blue'><b>Aunt</b></font>) was, so hard at the Vicar
that she (<font color='blue'><b>Aunt</b></font>) didn't hear me laugh as I danced a jig in the hall because of
the good time coming. What a pleasant life she (<font color='blue'><b>Aunt</b></font>) might have if only she (<font color='blue'><b>Aunt</b></font>)
chose! I don't envy her (<font color='blue'><b>Aunt</b></font>) much, in spite of her (<font color='blue'><b>Aunt</b></font>) money, for after all
rich people have about as many worries as poor ones, I think,''  (<font color='red'><b>Jo/Miss Jo/JO</b></font>)</div>added Jo.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``That reminds me,''  (<font color='red'><b>Meg</b></font>)</div>said Meg, <div class="bookquote">``that I've got something to tell. It isn't
funny, like Jo's story, but I thought about it a good deal as I came
home. At the Kings' today I found everybody in a flurry, and one of
the children said that her (<font color='blue'><b>Jo</b></font>) oldest brother had done something dreadful,
and Papa had sent him (<font color='blue'><b>Papa</b></font>) away. I heard Mrs. King crying and Mr. King
talking very loud, and Grace and Ellen turned away their faces when
they passed me, so I shouldn't see how red and swollen their eyes were.
I didn't ask any questions, of course, but I felt so sorry for them and
was rather glad I hadn't any wild brothers to do wicked things and
disgrace the family.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Meg</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I think being disgraced in school is a great deal try_inger_ than
anything bad boys can do,''  (<font color='red'><b>Amy/Amy March</b></font>)</div>said Amy, shaking her (<font color='blue'><b>Amy</b></font>) head, as if her (<font color='blue'><b>Amy</b></font>)
experience of life had been a deep one. ``Susie Perkins came to school
today with a lovely red carnelian ring. I wanted it dreadfully, and
wished I was her (<font color='blue'><b>Susie</b></font>) with all my might. Well, she (<font color='blue'><b>Susie</b></font>) drew a picture of Mr.
Davis, with a monstrous nose and a hump, and the words, ``Young ladies,
my eye is upon you!<div class="bookquote">'' coming out of his (<font color='blue'><b>I</b></font>) mouth in a balloon thing. We
were laughing over it when all of a sudden his (<font color='blue'><b>I</b></font>) eye _was_ on us, and he (<font color='blue'><b>I</b></font>)
ordered Susie to bring up her (<font color='blue'><b>Susie</b></font>) slate. She (<font color='blue'><b>Susie</b></font>) was _parry_lized with fright,
but she (<font color='blue'><b>Susie</b></font>) went, and oh, what _do_ you think he (<font color='blue'><b>I</b></font>) did? He (<font color='blue'><b>I</b></font>) took her (<font color='blue'><b>Susie</b></font>) by the
ear--the ear! Just fancy how horrid!--and led her (<font color='blue'><b>Susie</b></font>) to the recitation
platform, and made her (<font color='blue'><b>Susie</b></font>) stand there half an hour, holding the slate so
everyone could see.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Young ladies</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Didn't the girls laugh at the picture?''  (<font color='red'><b>Jo/Miss Jo/JO</b></font>)</div>asked Jo, who relished the
scrape.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Laugh? Not one! They sat still as mice, and Susie cried quarts, I know
she (<font color='blue'><b>Susie</b></font>) did. I didn't envy her (<font color='blue'><b>Susie</b></font>) then, for I felt that millions of carnelian
rings wouldn't have made me happy after that. I never, never should
have got over such a agonizing mortification.''  (<font color='red'><b>Amy/Amy March</b></font>)</div>And Amy went on with her (<font color='blue'><b>Amy</b></font>)
work, in the proud consciousness of virtue and the successful utterance
of two long words in a breath.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``I saw something I liked this morning, and I meant to tell it at
dinner, but I forgot,''  (<font color='red'><b>Beth</b></font>)</div>said Beth, putting Jo's topsy-turvy basket in
order as she (<font color='blue'><b>Beth</b></font>) talked. ``When I went to get some oysters for Hannah, Mr.
Laurence was in the fish shop, but he (<font color='blue'><b>Laurence</b></font>) didn't see me, for I kept behind
the fish barrel, and he (<font color='blue'><b>Laurence</b></font>) was busy with Mr. Cutter the fish-man. A poor
woman came in with a pail and a mop, and asked Mr. Cutter if he (<font color='blue'><b>Cutter</b></font>) would
let her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) do some scrubbing for a bit of fish, because she (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) hadn't any
dinner for her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) children, and had been disappointed of a day's work.
Mr. Cutter was in a hurry and said <div class="bookquote">``No', rather crossly, so she (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) was
going away, looking hungry and sorry, when Mr. Laurence hooked up a big
fish with the crooked end of his (<font color='blue'><b>Laurence</b></font>) cane and held it out to her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>). She (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) was
so glad and surprised she (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) took it right into her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) arms, and thanked him (<font color='blue'><b>Laurence</b></font>)
over and over. He (<font color='blue'><b>Laurence</b></font>) told her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) to `go along and cook it', and she (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) hurried
off, so happy! Wasn't it good of him (<font color='blue'><b>Laurence</b></font>)? Oh, she (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) did look so funny,
hugging the big, slippery fish, and hoping Mr. Laurence's bed in heaven
would be `aisy'.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Beth</b></font>)</div><p/>When they had laughed at Beth's story, they asked their mother for one,
and after a moments thought, she (<font color='blue'><b>Beth</b></font>) said soberly, ``As I sat cutting out
blue flannel jackets today at the rooms, I felt very anxious about
Father, and thought how lonely and helpless we should be, if anything
happened to him (<font color='blue'><b>Father</b></font>). It was not a wise thing to do, but I kept on worrying
till an old man came in with an order for some clothes. He (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) sat down
near me, and I began to talk to him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>), for he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) looked poor and tired and
anxious.

<p/><div class="bookquote">''`Have you sons in the army?''  (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div>I asked, for the note he (<font color='blue'><b>sons</b></font>) brought was not
to me.''

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Yes, ma'am. I had four, but two were killed, one is a prisoner, and
I'm going to the other, who is very sick in a Washington hospital.''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>sons</b></font>)
answered quietly.''

<p/><div class="bookquote">''`You have done a great deal for your country, sir,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>I said, feeling
respect now, instead of pity.''

<p/><div class="bookquote">''`Not a mite more than I ought, ma'am. I'd go myself, if I was any
use. As I ain't, I give my boys, and give 'em free.'''

 (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``He (<font color='blue'><b>prisoner</b></font>) spoke so cheerfully, looked so sincere, and seemed so glad to give
his (<font color='blue'><b>prisoner</b></font>) all, that I was ashamed of myself. I'd given one man and thought
it too much, while he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) gave four without grudging them. I had all my
girls to comfort me at home, and his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) last son was waiting, miles away,
to say good-by to him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>), perhaps! I felt so rich, so happy thinking of
my blessings, that I made him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) a nice bundle, gave him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) some money, and
thanked him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) heartily for the lesson he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) had taught me.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Tell another story, Mother, one with a moral to it, like this. I like
to think about them afterward, if they are real and not too preachy,''
 (<font color='red'><b>Jo/Miss Jo/JO</b></font>)</div>said Jo, after a minute's silence.

<p/>Mrs. March smiled and began at once, for she (<font color='blue'><b>Jo</b></font>) had told stories to this
little audience for many years, and knew how to please them.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Once upon a time, there were four girls, who had enough to eat and
drink and wear, a good many comforts and pleasures, kind friends and
parents who loved them dearly, and yet they were not contented.''  (<font color='red'><b>the listeners</b></font>)</div>-LRB-Here
the listeners stole sly looks at one another, and began to sew
diligently.-RRB- ``These girls were anxious to be good and made many
excellent resolutions, but they did not keep them very well, and were
constantly saying, ``If only we had this,'' or ``If we could only do
that,'' quite forgetting how much they already had, and how many things
they actually could do. So they asked an old woman what spell they
could use to make them happy, and she (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) said, <div class="bookquote">``When you feel
discontented, think over your blessings, and be grateful.'''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>-LRB-Here Jo
looked up quickly, as if about to speak, but changed her (<font color='blue'><b>Jo</b></font>) mind, seeing
that the story was not done yet.-RRB-

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Being sensible girls, they decided to try her (<font color='blue'><b>them</b></font>) advice, and soon were
surprised to see how well off they were. One discovered that money
couldn't keep shame and sorrow out of rich people's houses, another
that, though she (<font color='blue'><b>them</b></font>) was poor, she (<font color='blue'><b>them</b></font>) was a great deal happier, with her (<font color='blue'><b>them</b></font>)
youth, health, and good spirits, than a certain fretful, feeble old
lady who couldn't enjoy her (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) comforts, a third that, disagreeable as it
was to help get dinner, it was harder still to go begging for it and
the fourth, that even carnelian rings were not so valuable as good
behavior. So they agreed to stop complaining, to enjoy the blessings
already possessed, and try to deserve them, lest they should be taken
away entirely, instead of increased, and I believe they were never
disappointed or sorry that they took the old woman's advice.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Now, Marmee, that is very cunning of you to turn our own stories
against us, and give us a sermon instead of a romance!''  (<font color='red'><b>Meg</b></font>)</div>cried Meg.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``I like that kind of sermon. It's the sort Father used to tell us,''
 (<font color='red'><b>Beth</b></font>)</div>said Beth thoughtfully, putting the needles straight on Jo's cushion.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``I don't complain near as much as the others do, and I shall be more
careful than ever now, for I've had warning from Susie's downfall,''
 (<font color='red'><b>Amy/Amy March</b></font>)</div>said Amy morally.

<p/>``We needed that lesson, and we won't forget it. If we do so, you just
say to us, as old Chloe did in _Uncle Tom_, ``Tink ob yer marcies,
chillen!'' <div class="bookquote">``Tink ob yer marcies!'''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>added Jo, who could not, for the life
of her (<font color='blue'><b>Jo</b></font>), help getting a morsel of fun out of the little sermon, though
she (<font color='blue'><b>Jo</b></font>) took it to heart as much as any of them.



<p/>CHAPTER FIVE

<p/>BEING NEIGHBORLY

<p/><div class="bookquote">``What in the world are you going to do now, Jo?''  (<font color='red'><b>Meg</b></font>)</div>asked Meg one snowy
afternoon, as her (<font color='blue'><b>Meg</b></font>) sister came tramping through the hall, in rubber
boots, old sack, and hood, with a broom in one hand and a shovel in the
other.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Going out for exercise,''  (<font color='red'><b>Jo/Miss Jo/JO</b></font>)</div>answered Jo with a mischievous twinkle in her (<font color='blue'><b>Jo</b></font>)
eyes.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``I should think two long walks this morning would have been enough!
It's cold and dull out, and I advise you to stay warm and dry by the
fire, as I do,''  (<font color='red'><b>Meg</b></font>)</div>said Meg with a shiver.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Never take advice! Can't keep still all day, and not being a
pussycat, I don't like to doze by the fire. I like adventures, and I'm
going to find some.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Meg</b></font>)</div><p/>Meg went back to toast her (<font color='blue'><b>Meg</b></font>) feet and read _Ivanhoe_, and Jo began to dig
paths with great energy. The snow was light, and with her (<font color='blue'><b>Jo</b></font>) broom she (<font color='blue'><b>Jo</b></font>)
soon swept a path all round the garden, for Beth to walk in when the
sun came out and the invalid dolls needed air. Now, the garden
separated the Marches' house from that of Mr. Laurence. Both stood in
a suburb of the city, which was still country-like, with groves and
lawns, large gardens, and quiet streets. A low hedge parted the two
estates. On one side was an old, brown house, looking rather bare and
shabby, robbed of the vines that in summer covered its walls and the
flowers, which then surrounded it. On the other side was a stately
stone mansion, plainly betokening every sort of comfort and luxury,
from the big coach house and well-kept grounds to the conservatory and
the glimpses of lovely things one caught between the rich curtains.

<p/>Yet it seemed a lonely, lifeless sort of house, for no children
frolicked on the lawn, no motherly face ever smiled at the windows, and
few people went in and out, except the old gentleman and his (<font color='blue'><b>gentleman</b></font>) grandson.

<p/>To Jo's lively fancy, this fine house seemed a kind of enchanted
palace, full of splendors and delights which no one enjoyed. She (<font color='blue'><b>Jo</b></font>) had
long wanted to behold these hidden glories, and to know the Laurence
boy, who looked as if he (<font color='blue'><b>Laurence</b></font>) would like to be known, if he (<font color='blue'><b>Laurence</b></font>) only knew how to
begin. Since the party, she (<font color='blue'><b>Jo</b></font>) had been more eager than ever, and had
planned many ways of making friends with him (<font color='blue'><b>Laurence</b></font>), but he (<font color='blue'><b>Laurence</b></font>) had not been seen
lately, and Jo began to think he (<font color='blue'><b>Laurence</b></font>) had gone away, when she (<font color='blue'><b>Jo</b></font>) one day spied
a brown face at an upper window, looking wistfully down into their
garden, where Beth and Amy were snow-balling one another.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``That boy is suffering for society and fun,''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Beth</b></font>) said to herself. <div class="bookquote">``His (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>)
grandpa does not know what's good for him (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>), and keeps him (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>) shut up all
alone. He (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>) needs a party of jolly boys to play with, or somebody young
and lively. I've a great mind to go over and tell the old gentleman
so!''

 (<font color='red'><b>Jo/Miss Jo/JO</b></font>)</div><p/>The idea amused Jo, who liked to do daring things and was always
scandalizing Meg by her (<font color='blue'><b>Meg</b></font>) queer performances. The plan of `going over'
was not forgotten. And when the snowy afternoon came, Jo resolved to
try what could be done. She (<font color='blue'><b>Jo</b></font>) saw Mr. Lawrence drive off, and then
sallied out to dig her (<font color='blue'><b>Jo</b></font>) way down to the hedge, where she (<font color='blue'><b>Jo</b></font>) paused and took
a survey. All quiet, curtains down at the lower windows, servants out
of sight, and nothing human visible but a curly black head leaning on a
thin hand at the upper window.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``There he (<font color='blue'><b>gentleman</b></font>) is,''  (<font color='red'><b>Jo/Miss Jo/JO</b></font>)</div>thought Jo, <div class="bookquote">``Poor boy! All alone and sick this dismal
day. It's a shame! I'll toss up a snowball and make him (<font color='blue'><b>gentleman</b></font>) look out, and
then say a kind word to him (<font color='blue'><b>gentleman</b></font>).''

 (<font color='red'><b>Jo/Miss Jo/JO</b></font>)</div><p/>Up went a handful of soft snow, and the head turned at once, showing a
face which lost its listless look in a minute, as the big eyes
brightened and the mouth began to smile. Jo nodded and laughed, and
flourished her (<font color='blue'><b>Jo</b></font>) broom as she (<font color='blue'><b>Jo</b></font>) called out...

<p/><div class="bookquote">``How do you do? Are you sick?''

 (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div><p/>Laurie opened the window, and croaked out as hoarsely as a raven...

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Better, thank you. I've had a bad cold, and been shut up a week.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Laurie/Mr. Laurie/LAURIE</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I'm sorry. What do you amuse yourself with?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Nothing. It's dull as tombs up here.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Don't you read?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Not much. They won't let me.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Can't somebody read to you?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Grandpa does sometimes, but my books don't interest him (<font color='blue'><b>Grandpa</b></font>), and I hate to
ask Brooke all the time.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Have someone come and see you then.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``There isn't anyone I'd like to see. Boys make such a row, and my head
is weak.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Isn't there some nice girl who'd read and amuse you? Girls are quiet
and like to play nurse.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Don't know any.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``You know us,''  (<font color='red'><b>Jo/Miss Jo/JO</b></font>)</div>began Jo, then laughed and stopped.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``So I do! Will you come, please?''  (<font color='red'><b>Laurie/Mr. Laurie/LAURIE</b></font>)</div>cried Laurie.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``I'm not quiet and nice, but I'll come, if Mother will let me. I'll go
ask her (<font color='blue'><b>Mother</b></font>). Shut the window, like a good boy, and wait till I come.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Jo/Miss Jo/JO</b></font>)</div><p/>With that, Jo shouldered her (<font color='blue'><b>Jo</b></font>) broom and marched into the house,
wondering what they would all say to her (<font color='blue'><b>Jo</b></font>). Laurie was in a flutter of
excitement at the idea of having company, and flew about to get ready,
for as Mrs. March said, he (<font color='blue'><b>Laurie</b></font>) was 'a little gentleman', and did honor to
the coming guest by brushing his (<font color='blue'><b>Laurie</b></font>) curly pate, putting on a fresh color,
and trying to tidy up the room, which in spite of half a dozen
servants, was anything but neat. Presently there came a loud ring,
than a decided voice, asking for ``Mr. Laurie', and a surprised-looking
servant came running up to announce a young lady.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``All right, show her (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) up, it's Miss Jo,''  (<font color='red'><b>Laurie/Mr. Laurie/LAURIE</b></font>)</div>said Laurie, going to the door
of his (<font color='blue'><b>Laurie</b></font>) little parlor to meet Jo, who appeared, looking rosy and quite
at her (<font color='blue'><b>Jo</b></font>) ease, with a covered dish in one hand and Beth's three kittens
in the other.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Here I am, bag and baggage,''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Beth</b></font>) said briskly. <div class="bookquote">``Mother sent her (<font color='blue'><b>Mother</b></font>) love,
and was glad if I could do anything for you. Meg wanted me to bring
some of her (<font color='blue'><b>Meg</b></font>) blanc mange, she (<font color='blue'><b>Meg</b></font>) makes it very nicely, and Beth thought her (<font color='blue'><b>Beth</b></font>)
cats would be comforting. I knew you'd laugh at them, but I couldn't
refuse, she (<font color='blue'><b>Beth</b></font>) was so anxious to do something.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Beth</b></font>)</div><p/>It so happened that Beth's funny loan was just the thing, for in
laughing over the kits, Laurie forgot his (<font color='blue'><b>Laurie</b></font>) bashfulness, and grew
sociable at once.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``That looks too pretty to eat,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Laurie</b></font>) said, smiling with pleasure, as Jo
uncovered the dish, and showed the blanc mange, surrounded by a garland
of green leaves, and the scarlet flowers of Amy's pet geranium.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``It isn't anything, only they all felt kindly and wanted to show it.
Tell the girl to put it away for your tea. It's so simple you can eat
it, and being soft, it will slip down without hurting your sore throat.
What a cozy room this is!''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``It might be if it was kept nice, but the maids are lazy, and I don't
know how to make them mind. It worries me though.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I'll right it up in two minutes, for it only needs to have the hearth
brushed, so--and the things made straight on the mantelpiece, so--and
the books put here, and the bottles there, and your sofa turned from
the light, and the pillows plumped up a bit. Now then, you're fixed.''

 (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div><p/>And so he (<font color='blue'><b>Laurie</b></font>) was, for, as she (<font color='blue'><b>Amy</b></font>) laughed and talked, Jo had whisked things
into place and given quite a different air to the room. Laurie watched
her (<font color='blue'><b>Jo</b></font>) in respectful silence, and when she (<font color='blue'><b>Jo</b></font>) beckoned him (<font color='blue'><b>Laurie</b></font>) to his (<font color='blue'><b>Laurie</b></font>) sofa, he (<font color='blue'><b>Laurie</b></font>)
sat down with a sigh of satisfaction, saying gratefully...

<p/><div class="bookquote">``How kind you are! Yes, that's what it wanted. Now please take the
big chair and let me do something to amuse my company.''

 (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``No, I came to amuse you. Shall I read aloud?''  (<font color='red'><b>Jo/Miss Jo/JO</b></font>)</div>and Jo looked
affectionately toward some inviting books near by.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Thank you! I've read all those, and if you don't mind, I'd rather
talk,''  (<font color='red'><b>Laurie/Mr. Laurie/LAURIE</b></font>)</div>answered Laurie.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Not a bit. I'll talk all day if you'll only set me going. Beth says I
never know when to stop.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Is Beth the rosy one, who stays at home good deal and sometimes goes
out with a little basket?''  (<font color='red'><b>Laurie/Mr. Laurie/LAURIE</b></font>)</div>asked Laurie with interest.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Yes, that's Beth. She (<font color='blue'><b>Beth</b></font>)'s my girl, and a regular good one she (<font color='blue'><b>Beth</b></font>) is, too.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``The pretty one is Meg, and the curly-haired one is Amy, I believe?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``How did you find that out?''

 (<font color='red'><b>Laurie/Mr. Laurie/LAURIE</b></font>)</div><p/>Laurie colored up, but answered frankly, <div class="bookquote">``Why, you see I often hear you
calling to one another, and when I'm alone up here, I can't help
looking over at your house, you always seem to be having such good
times. I beg your pardon for being so rude, but sometimes you forget
to put down the curtain at the window where the flowers are. And when
the lamps are lighted, it's like looking at a picture to see the fire,
and you all around the table with your mother. Her (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) face is right
opposite, and it looks so sweet behind the flowers, I can't help
watching it. I haven't got any mother, you know.''  (<font color='red'><b>Laurie/Mr. Laurie/LAURIE</b></font>)</div>And Laurie poked the
fire to hide a little twitching of the lips that he (<font color='blue'><b>Laurie</b></font>) could not control.

<p/>The solitary, hungry look in his (<font color='blue'><b>Laurie</b></font>) eyes went straight to Jo's warm heart.
She (<font color='blue'><b>Jo</b></font>) had been so simply taught that there was no nonsense in her (<font color='blue'><b>Jo</b></font>) head,
and at fifteen she (<font color='blue'><b>Jo</b></font>) was as innocent and frank as any child. Laurie was
sick and lonely, and feeling how rich she (<font color='blue'><b>Jo</b></font>) was in home and happiness,
she (<font color='blue'><b>Jo</b></font>) gladly tried to share it with him (<font color='blue'><b>Laurie</b></font>). Her (<font color='blue'><b>Jo</b></font>) face was very friendly and
her (<font color='blue'><b>Jo</b></font>) sharp voice unusually gentle as she (<font color='blue'><b>Jo</b></font>) said...

<p/><div class="bookquote">``We'll never draw that curtain any more, and I give you leave to look
as much as you like. I just wish, though, instead of peeping, you'd
come over and see us. Mother is so splendid, she (<font color='blue'><b>Mother</b></font>)'d do you heaps of
good, and Beth would sing to you if I begged her (<font color='blue'><b>Beth</b></font>) to, and Amy would
dance. Meg and I would make you laugh over our funny stage properties,
and we'd have jolly times. Wouldn't your grandpa let you?''

 (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I think he (<font color='blue'><b>grandpa</b></font>) would, if your mother asked him (<font color='blue'><b>grandpa</b></font>). He (<font color='blue'><b>grandpa</b></font>)'s very kind, though he (<font color='blue'><b>grandpa</b></font>)
does not look so, and he (<font color='blue'><b>grandpa</b></font>) lets me do what I like, pretty much, only he (<font color='blue'><b>grandpa</b></font>)'s
afraid I might be a bother to strangers,''  (<font color='red'><b>Laurie/Mr. Laurie/LAURIE</b></font>)</div>began Laurie, brightening
more and more.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``We are not strangers, we are neighbors, and you needn't think you'd be
a bother. We want to know you, and I've been trying to do it this ever
so long. We haven't been here a great while, you know, but we have got
acquainted with all our neighbors but you.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``You see, Grandpa lives among his (<font color='blue'><b>Grandpa</b></font>) books, and doesn't mind much what
happens outside. Mr. Brooke, my tutor, doesn't stay here, you know,
and I have no one to go about with me, so I just stop at home and get
on as I can.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``That's bad. You ought to make an effort and go visiting everywhere
you are asked, then you'll have plenty of friends, and pleasant places
to go to. Never mind being bashful. It won't last long if you keep
going.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Laurie/Mr. Laurie/LAURIE</b></font>)</div><p/>Laurie turned red again, but wasn't offended at being accused of
bashfulness, for there was so much good will in Jo it was impossible
not to take her (<font color='blue'><b>Jo</b></font>) blunt speeches as kindly as they were meant.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Do you like your school?''  (<font color='red'><b>the boy</b></font>)</div>asked the boy, changing the subject, after a
little pause, during which he (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>) stared at the fire and Jo looked about
her (<font color='blue'><b>Jo</b></font>), well pleased.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Don't go to school, I'm a businessman--girl, I mean. I go to wait on
my great-aunt, and a dear, cross old soul she (<font color='blue'><b>great-aunt</b></font>) is, too,''  (<font color='red'><b>Jo/Miss Jo/JO</b></font>)</div>answered Jo.

<p/>Laurie opened his (<font color='blue'><b>Laurie</b></font>) mouth to ask another question, but remembering just
in time that it wasn't manners to make too many inquiries into people's
affairs, he (<font color='blue'><b>Laurie</b></font>) shut it again, and looked uncomfortable.

<p/>Jo liked his (<font color='blue'><b>Laurie</b></font>) good breeding, and didn't mind having a laugh at Aunt
March, so she (<font color='blue'><b>Aunt</b></font>) gave him (<font color='blue'><b>Laurie</b></font>) a lively description of the fidgety old lady,
her (<font color='blue'><b>Aunt</b></font>) fat poodle, the parrot that talked Spanish, and the library where
she (<font color='blue'><b>Aunt</b></font>) reveled.

<p/>Laurie enjoyed that immensely, and when she (<font color='blue'><b>Aunt</b></font>) told about the prim old
gentleman who came once to woo Aunt March, and in the middle of a fine
speech, how Poll had tweaked his (<font color='blue'><b>Laurie</b></font>) wig off to his (<font color='blue'><b>Laurie</b></font>) great dismay, the boy
lay back and laughed till the tears ran down his (<font color='blue'><b>Laurie</b></font>) cheeks, and a maid
popped her (<font color='blue'><b>maid</b></font>) head in to see what was the matter.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Oh! That does me no end of good. Tell on, please,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Laurie</b></font>) said, taking
his (<font color='blue'><b>Laurie</b></font>) face out of the sofa cushion, red and shining with merriment.

<p/>Much elated with her (<font color='blue'><b>maid</b></font>) success, Jo did `tell on', all about their plays
and plans, their hopes and fears for Father, and the most interesting
events of the little world in which the sisters lived. Then they got
to talking about books, and to Jo's delight, she (<font color='blue'><b>Jo</b></font>) found that Laurie
loved them as well as she (<font color='blue'><b>Jo</b></font>) did, and had read even more than herself.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``If you like them so much, come down and see ours. Grandfather is out,
so you needn't be afraid,''  (<font color='red'><b>Laurie/Mr. Laurie/LAURIE</b></font>)</div>said Laurie, getting up.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``I'm not afraid of anything,''  (<font color='red'><b>Jo/Miss Jo/JO</b></font>)</div>returned Jo, with a toss of the head.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``I don't believe you are!''  (<font color='red'><b>the boy</b></font>)</div>exclaimed the boy, looking at her (<font color='blue'><b>Jo</b></font>) with much
admiration, though he (<font color='blue'><b>Laurie</b></font>) privately thought she (<font color='blue'><b>Jo</b></font>) would have good reason to
be a trifle afraid of the old gentleman, if she (<font color='blue'><b>Jo</b></font>) met him (<font color='blue'><b>gentleman</b></font>) in some of his (<font color='blue'><b>gentleman</b></font>)
moods.

<p/>The atmosphere of the whole house being summerlike, Laurie led the way
from room to room, letting Jo stop to examine whatever struck her (<font color='blue'><b>Jo</b></font>)
fancy. And so, at last they came to the library, where she (<font color='blue'><b>Jo</b></font>) clapped her (<font color='blue'><b>Jo</b></font>)
hands and pranced, as she (<font color='blue'><b>Jo</b></font>) always did when especially delighted. It was
lined with books, and there were pictures and statues, and distracting
little cabinets full of coins and curiosities, and Sleepy Hollow
chairs, and queer tables, and bronzes, and best of all, a great open
fireplace with quaint tiles all round it.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``What richness!''  (<font color='red'><b>Jo/Miss Jo/JO</b></font>)</div>sighed Jo, sinking into the depth of a velour chair
and gazing about her (<font color='blue'><b>Jo</b></font>) with an air of intense satisfaction. <div class="bookquote">``Theodore
Laurence, you ought to be the happiest boy in the world,''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Jo</b></font>) added
impressively.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``A fellow can't live on books,''  (<font color='red'><b>Laurie/Mr. Laurie/LAURIE</b></font>)</div>said Laurie, shaking his (<font color='blue'><b>Laurie</b></font>) head as he (<font color='blue'><b>Laurie</b></font>)
perched on a table opposite.

<p/>Before he (<font color='blue'><b>Laurie</b></font>) could more, a bell rang, and Jo flew up, exclaiming with
alarm, <div class="bookquote">``Mercy me! It's your grandpa!''

 (<font color='red'><b>Jo/Miss Jo/JO</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Well, what if it is? You are not afraid of anything, you know,''
 (<font color='red'><b>the boy</b></font>)</div>returned the boy, looking wicked.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``I think I am a little bit afraid of him (<font color='blue'><b>grandpa</b></font>), but I don't know why I should
be. Marmee said I might come, and I don't think you're any the worse
for it,''  (<font color='red'><b>Jo/Miss Jo/JO</b></font>)</div>said Jo, composing herself, though she (<font color='blue'><b>Jo</b></font>) kept her (<font color='blue'><b>Jo</b></font>) eyes on the
door.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``I'm a great deal better for it, and ever so much obliged. I'm only
afraid you are very tired of talking to me. It was so pleasant, I
couldn't bear to stop,''  (<font color='red'><b>Laurie/Mr. Laurie/LAURIE</b></font>)</div>said Laurie gratefully.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``The doctor to see you, sir,''  (<font color='red'><b>the maid</b></font>)</div>and the maid beckoned as she (<font color='blue'><b>maid</b></font>) spoke.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Would you mind if I left you for a minute? I suppose I must see him (<font color='blue'><b>doctor</b></font>),''
 (<font color='red'><b>Laurie/Mr. Laurie/LAURIE</b></font>)</div>said Laurie.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Don't mind me. I'm happy as a cricket here,''  (<font color='red'><b>Jo/Miss Jo/JO</b></font>)</div>answered Jo.

<p/>Laurie went away, and his (<font color='blue'><b>Laurie</b></font>) guest amused herself in her (<font color='blue'><b>Jo</b></font>) own way. She (<font color='blue'><b>Jo</b></font>) was
standing before a fine portrait of the old gentleman when the door
opened again, and without turning, she (<font color='blue'><b>Jo</b></font>) said decidedly, <div class="bookquote">``I'm sure now
that I shouldn't be afraid of him (<font color='blue'><b>doctor</b></font>), for he (<font color='blue'><b>doctor</b></font>)'s got kind eyes, though his (<font color='blue'><b>doctor</b></font>)
mouth is grim, and he (<font color='blue'><b>doctor</b></font>) looks as if he (<font color='blue'><b>doctor</b></font>) had a tremendous will of his (<font color='blue'><b>doctor</b></font>) own.
He (<font color='blue'><b>doctor</b></font>) isn't as handsome as my grandfather, but I like him (<font color='blue'><b>doctor</b></font>).''

 (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Thank you, ma'am,''  (<font color='red'><b>her</b></font>)</div>said a gruff voice behind her (<font color='blue'><b>Jo</b></font>), and there, to her (<font color='blue'><b>Jo</b></font>)
great dismay, stood old Mr. Laurence.

<p/>Poor Jo blushed till she (<font color='blue'><b>Jo</b></font>) couldn't blush any redder, and her (<font color='blue'><b>Jo</b></font>) heart began
to beat uncomfortably fast as she (<font color='blue'><b>Jo</b></font>) thought what she (<font color='blue'><b>Jo</b></font>) had said. For a
minute a wild desire to run away possessed her (<font color='blue'><b>Jo</b></font>), but that was cowardly,
and the girls would laugh at her (<font color='blue'><b>Jo</b></font>), so she (<font color='blue'><b>Jo</b></font>) resolved to stay and get out
of the scrape as she (<font color='blue'><b>Jo</b></font>) could. A second look showed her (<font color='blue'><b>Jo</b></font>) that the living
eyes, under the bushy eyebrows, were kinder even than the painted ones,
and there was a sly twinkle in them, which lessened her (<font color='blue'><b>Jo</b></font>) fear a good
deal. The gruff voice was gruffer than ever, as the old gentleman said
abruptly, after the dreadful pause, <div class="bookquote">``So you're not afraid of me, hey?''

 (<font color='red'><b>the gentleman</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Not much, sir.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``And you don't think me as handsome as your grandfather?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Not quite, sir.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``And I've got a tremendous will, have I?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I only said I thought so.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``But you like me in spite of it?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Yes, I do, sir.''

 (<font color='red'><b>the gentleman</b></font>)</div><p/>That answer pleased the old gentleman. He (<font color='blue'><b>gentleman</b></font>) gave a short laugh, shook
hands with her (<font color='blue'><b>Jo</b></font>), and, putting his (<font color='blue'><b>gentleman</b></font>) finger under her (<font color='blue'><b>Jo</b></font>) chin, turned up her (<font color='blue'><b>Jo</b></font>)
face, examined it gravely, and let it go, saying with a nod, <div class="bookquote">``You've
got your grandfather's spirit, if you haven't his (<font color='blue'><b>grandfather</b></font>) face. He (<font color='blue'><b>grandfather</b></font>) was a fine
man, my dear, but what is better, he (<font color='blue'><b>grandfather</b></font>) was a brave and an honest one, and
I was proud to be his (<font color='blue'><b>grandfather</b></font>) friend.''

 (<font color='red'><b>her</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Thank you, sir,''  (<font color='red'><b>Jo/Miss Jo/JO</b></font>)</div>And Jo was quite comfortable after that, for it
suited her (<font color='blue'><b>Jo</b></font>) exactly.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``What have you been doing to this boy of mine, hey?''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>was the next
question, sharply put.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Only trying to be neighborly, sir.''  (<font color='red'><b>Jo/Miss Jo/JO</b></font>)</div>And Jo told how her (<font color='blue'><b>Jo</b></font>) visit came
about.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``You think he (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>) needs cheering up a bit, do you?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Yes, sir, he (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>) seems a little lonely, and young folks would do him (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>) good
perhaps. We are only girls, but we should be glad to help if we could,
for we don't forget the splendid Christmas present you sent us,''  (<font color='red'><b>Jo/Miss Jo/JO</b></font>)</div>said
Jo eagerly.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Tut, tut, tut! That was the boy's affair. How is the poor woman?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Doing nicely, sir.''  (<font color='red'><b>Jo/Miss Jo/JO</b></font>)</div>And off went Jo, talking very fast, as she (<font color='blue'><b>Jo</b></font>) told
all about the Hummels, in whom her (<font color='blue'><b>Jo</b></font>) mother had interested richer friends
than they were.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Just her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) father's way of doing good. I shall come and see your mother
some fine day. Tell her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) so. There's the tea bell, we have it early on
the boy's account. Come down and go on being neighborly.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``If you'd like to have me, sir.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Shouldn't ask you, if I didn't.''  (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Laurence/Laurence/LAURENCE</b></font>)</div>And Mr. Laurence offered her (<font color='blue'><b>Jo</b></font>) his (<font color='blue'><b>Laurence</b></font>) arm
with old-fashioned courtesy.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``What would Meg say to this?''  (<font color='red'><b>Jo/Miss Jo/JO</b></font>)</div>thought Jo, as she (<font color='blue'><b>Jo</b></font>) was marched away,
while her (<font color='blue'><b>Jo</b></font>) eyes danced with fun as she (<font color='blue'><b>Jo</b></font>) imagined herself telling the
story at home.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Hey! Why, what the dickens has come to the fellow?''  (<font color='red'><b>the gentleman</b></font>)</div>said the old
gentleman, as Laurie came running downstairs and brought up with a
start of surprise at the astounding sight of Jo arm in arm with his (<font color='blue'><b>Laurie</b></font>)
redoubtable grandfather.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``I didn't know you'd come, sir,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Laurie</b></font>) began, as Jo gave him (<font color='blue'><b>Laurie</b></font>) a triumphant
little glance.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``That's evident, by the way you racket downstairs. Come to your tea,
sir, and behave like a gentleman.''  (<font color='red'><b>the boy</b></font>)</div>And having pulled the boy's hair by
way of a caress, Mr. Laurence walked on, while Laurie went through a
series of comic evolutions behind their backs, which nearly produced an
explosion of laughter from Jo.

<p/>The old gentleman did not say much as he (<font color='blue'><b>gentleman</b></font>) drank his (<font color='blue'><b>gentleman</b></font>) four cups of tea,
but he (<font color='blue'><b>gentleman</b></font>) watched the young people, who soon chatted away like old
friends, and the change in his (<font color='blue'><b>gentleman</b></font>) grandson did not escape him (<font color='blue'><b>gentleman</b></font>). There was
color, light, and life in the boy's face now, vivacity in his (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>) manner,
and genuine merriment in his (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>) laugh.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``She (<font color='blue'><b>Meg</b></font>)'s right, the lad is lonely. I'll see what these little girls can
do for him (<font color='blue'><b>lad</b></font>),''  (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Laurence/Laurence/LAURENCE</b></font>)</div>thought Mr. Laurence, as he (<font color='blue'><b>Laurence</b></font>) looked and listened. He (<font color='blue'><b>Laurence</b></font>) liked
Jo, for her (<font color='blue'><b>Jo</b></font>) odd, blunt ways suited him (<font color='blue'><b>Laurence</b></font>), and she (<font color='blue'><b>Jo</b></font>) seemed to understand
the boy almost as well as if she (<font color='blue'><b>Jo</b></font>) had been one herself.

<p/>If the Laurences had been what Jo called `prim and poky', she (<font color='blue'><b>Jo</b></font>) would not
have got on at all, for such people always made her (<font color='blue'><b>Jo</b></font>) shy and awkward.
But finding them free and easy, she (<font color='blue'><b>Jo</b></font>) was so herself, and made a good
impression. When they rose she (<font color='blue'><b>Jo</b></font>) proposed to go, but Laurie said he (<font color='blue'><b>Laurie</b></font>) had
something more to show her (<font color='blue'><b>Jo</b></font>), and took her (<font color='blue'><b>Jo</b></font>) away to the conservatory,
which had been lighted for her (<font color='blue'><b>Jo</b></font>) benefit. It seemed quite fairylike to
Jo, as she (<font color='blue'><b>Jo</b></font>) went up and down the walks, enjoying the blooming walls on
either side, the soft light, the damp sweet air, and the wonderful
vines and trees that hung about her (<font color='blue'><b>Jo</b></font>), while her (<font color='blue'><b>Jo</b></font>) new friend cut the
finest flowers till his (<font color='blue'><b>friend</b></font>) hands were full. Then he (<font color='blue'><b>friend</b></font>) tied them up, saying,
with the happy look Jo liked to see, <div class="bookquote">``Please give these to your mother,
and tell her (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) I like the medicine she (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) sent me very much.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Jo/Miss Jo/JO</b></font>)</div><p/>They found Mr. Laurence standing before the fire in the great drawing
room, but Jo's attention was entirely absorbed by a grand piano, which
stood open.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Do you play?''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Jo</b></font>) asked, turning to Laurie with a respectful
expression.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Sometimes,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Laurie</b></font>) answered modestly.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Please do now. I want to hear it, so I can tell Beth.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Won't you first?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Don't know how. Too stupid to learn, but I love music dearly.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Laurie/Mr. Laurie/LAURIE</b></font>)</div><p/>So Laurie played and Jo listened, with her (<font color='blue'><b>Jo</b></font>) nose luxuriously buried in
heliotrope and tea roses. Her (<font color='blue'><b>Jo</b></font>) respect and regard for the ``Laurence'
boy increased very much, for he (<font color='blue'><b>Laurence</b></font>) played remarkably well and didn't put
on any airs. She (<font color='blue'><b>Beth</b></font>) wished Beth could hear him (<font color='blue'><b>Laurence</b></font>), but she (<font color='blue'><b>Beth</b></font>) did not say so,
only praised him (<font color='blue'><b>Laurence</b></font>) till he (<font color='blue'><b>Laurence</b></font>) was quite abashed, and his (<font color='blue'><b>Laurence</b></font>) grandfather came to
his (<font color='blue'><b>Laurence</b></font>) rescue.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``That will do, that will do, young lady. Too many sugarplums are not
good for him (<font color='blue'><b>Laurence</b></font>). His (<font color='blue'><b>Laurence</b></font>) music isn't bad, but I hope he (<font color='blue'><b>Laurence</b></font>) will do as well in
more important things. Going? well, I'm much obliged to you, and I
hope you'll come again. My respects to your mother. Good night, Doctor
Jo.''

 (<font color='red'><b>He</b></font>)</div><p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Laurie</b></font>) shook hands kindly, but looked as if something did not please him (<font color='blue'><b>Laurie</b></font>).
When they got into the hall, Jo asked Laurie if she (<font color='blue'><b>Jo</b></font>) had said something
amiss. He (<font color='blue'><b>Laurie</b></font>) shook his (<font color='blue'><b>Laurie</b></font>) head.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``No, it was me. He (<font color='blue'><b>Doctor</b></font>) doesn't like to hear me play.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Why not?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I'll tell you some day. John is going home with you, as I can't.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``No need of that. I am not a young lady, and it's only a step. Take
care of yourself, won't you?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Yes, but you will come again, I hope?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``If you promise to come and see us after you are well.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I will.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Good night, Laurie!''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Good night, Jo, good night!''

 (<font color='red'><b>the family</b></font>)</div><p/>When all the afternoon's adventures had been told, the family felt
inclined to go visiting in a body, for each found something very
attractive in the big house on the other side of the hedge. Mrs. March
wanted to talk of her (<font color='blue'><b>Jo</b></font>) father with the old man who had not forgotten
him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>), Meg longed to walk in the conservatory, Beth sighed for the grand
piano, and Amy was eager to see the fine pictures and statues.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Mother, why didn't Mr. Laurence like to have Laurie play?''  (<font color='red'><b>Jo/Miss Jo/JO</b></font>)</div>asked Jo,
who was of an inquiring disposition.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``I am not sure, but I think it was because his (<font color='blue'><b>Laurie</b></font>) son, Laurie's father,
married an Italian lady, a musician, which displeased the old man, who
is very proud. The lady was good and lovely and accomplished, but he (<font color='blue'><b>musician</b></font>)
did not like her (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>), and never saw his (<font color='blue'><b>musician</b></font>) son after he (<font color='blue'><b>musician</b></font>) married. They both
died when Laurie was a little child, and then his (<font color='blue'><b>Laurie</b></font>) grandfather took him (<font color='blue'><b>Laurie</b></font>)
home. I fancy the boy, who was born in Italy, is not very strong, and
the old man is afraid of losing him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>), which makes him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) so careful.
Laurie comes naturally by his (<font color='blue'><b>Laurie</b></font>) love of music, for he (<font color='blue'><b>Laurie</b></font>) is like his (<font color='blue'><b>Laurie</b></font>) mother,
and I dare say his (<font color='blue'><b>Laurie</b></font>) grandfather fears that he (<font color='blue'><b>Laurie</b></font>) may want to be a musician.
At any rate, his (<font color='blue'><b>Laurie</b></font>) skill reminds him (<font color='blue'><b>Laurie</b></font>) of the woman he (<font color='blue'><b>Laurie</b></font>) did not like, and so
he (<font color='blue'><b>Laurie</b></font>) `glowered' as Jo said.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Dear me, how romantic!''  (<font color='red'><b>Meg</b></font>)</div>exclaimed Meg.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``How silly!''  (<font color='red'><b>Jo/Miss Jo/JO</b></font>)</div>said Jo. <div class="bookquote">``Let him (<font color='blue'><b>Laurie</b></font>) be a musician if he (<font color='blue'><b>Laurie</b></font>) wants to, and not
plague his (<font color='blue'><b>Laurie</b></font>) life out sending him (<font color='blue'><b>Laurie</b></font>) to college, when he (<font color='blue'><b>Laurie</b></font>) hates to go.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``That's why he (<font color='blue'><b>Laurie</b></font>) has such handsome black eyes and pretty manners, I
suppose. Italians are always nice,''  (<font color='red'><b>Meg</b></font>)</div>said Meg, who was a little
sentimental.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``What do you know about his (<font color='blue'><b>Laurie</b></font>) eyes and his (<font color='blue'><b>Laurie</b></font>) manners? You never spoke to
him (<font color='blue'><b>Laurie</b></font>), hardly,''  (<font color='red'><b>Jo/Miss Jo/JO</b></font>)</div>cried Jo, who was not sentimental.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``I saw him (<font color='blue'><b>Laurie</b></font>) at the party, and what you tell shows that he (<font color='blue'><b>Laurie</b></font>) knows how to
behave. That was a nice little speech about the medicine Mother sent
him (<font color='blue'><b>Laurie</b></font>).''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``He (<font color='blue'><b>Laurie</b></font>) meant the blanc mange, I suppose.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``How stupid you are, child! He (<font color='blue'><b>Laurie</b></font>) meant you, of course.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Did he (<font color='blue'><b>Laurie</b></font>)?''  (<font color='red'><b>Jo/Miss Jo/JO</b></font>)</div>And Jo opened her (<font color='blue'><b>Jo</b></font>) eyes as if it had never occurred to her (<font color='blue'><b>Jo</b></font>)
before.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``I never saw such a girl! You don't know a compliment when you get
it,''  (<font color='red'><b>Meg</b></font>)</div>said Meg, with the air of a young lady who knew all about the
matter.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``I think they are great nonsense, and I'll thank you not to be silly
and spoil my fun. Laurie's a nice boy and I like him (<font color='blue'><b>Laurie</b></font>), and I won't have
any sentimental stuff about compliments and such rubbish. We'll all be
good to him (<font color='blue'><b>Laurie</b></font>) because he (<font color='blue'><b>Laurie</b></font>) hasn't got any mother, and he (<font color='blue'><b>Laurie</b></font>) may come over and
see us, mayn't he (<font color='blue'><b>Laurie</b></font>), Marmee?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Yes, Jo, your little friend is very welcome, and I hope Meg will
remember that children should be children as long as they can.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I don't call myself a child, and I'm not in my teens yet,''  (<font color='red'><b>Amy/Amy March</b></font>)</div>observed
Amy. <div class="bookquote">``What do you say, Beth?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I was thinking about our '_Pilgrim's Progress_',''  (<font color='red'><b>Beth</b></font>)</div>answered Beth, who
had not heard a word. <div class="bookquote">``How we got out of the Slough and through the
Wicket Gate by resolving to be good, and up the steep hill by trying,
and that maybe the house over there, full of splendid things, is going
to be our Palace Beautiful.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``We have got to get by the lions first,''  (<font color='red'><b>Jo/Miss Jo/JO</b></font>)</div>said Jo, as if she (<font color='blue'><b>Jo</b></font>) rather
liked the prospect.



<p/>CHAPTER SIX

<p/>BETH FINDS THE PALACE BEAUTIFUL

<p/>The big house did prove a Palace Beautiful, though it took some time
for all to get in, and Beth found it very hard to pass the lions. Old
Mr. Laurence was the biggest one, but after he (<font color='blue'><b>Laurence</b></font>) had called, said
something funny or kind to each one of the girls, and talked over old
times with their mother, nobody felt much afraid of him (<font color='blue'><b>Laurence</b></font>), except timid
Beth. The other lion was the fact that they were poor and Laurie rich,
for this made them shy of accepting favors which they could not return.
But, after a while, they found that he (<font color='blue'><b>Laurie</b></font>) considered them the benefactors,
and could not do enough to show how grateful he (<font color='blue'><b>Laurie</b></font>) was for Mrs. March's
motherly welcome, their cheerful society, and the comfort he (<font color='blue'><b>Laurie</b></font>) took in
that humble home of theirs. So they soon forgot their pride and
interchanged kindnesses without stopping to think which was the greater.

<p/>All sorts of pleasant things happened about that time, for the new
friendship flourished like grass in spring. Every one liked Laurie,
and he (<font color='blue'><b>Laurie</b></font>) privately informed his (<font color='blue'><b>Laurie</b></font>) tutor that <div class="bookquote">``the Marches were regularly
splendid girls.''  (<font color='red'><b>tutor girls</b></font>)</div>With the delightful enthusiasm of youth, they took
the solitary boy into their midst and made much of him (<font color='blue'><b>Laurie</b></font>), and he (<font color='blue'><b>Laurie</b></font>) found
something very charming in the innocent companionship of these
simple-hearted girls. Never having known mother or sisters, he (<font color='blue'><b>Laurie</b></font>) was
quick to feel the influences they brought about him (<font color='blue'><b>Laurie</b></font>), and their busy,
lively ways made him (<font color='blue'><b>Laurie</b></font>) ashamed of the indolent life he (<font color='blue'><b>Laurie</b></font>) led. He (<font color='blue'><b>Laurie</b></font>) was tired
of books, and found people so interesting now that Mr. Brooke was
obliged to make very unsatisfactory reports, for Laurie was always
playing truant and running over to the Marches'.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Never mind, let him (<font color='blue'><b>Pilgrim</b></font>) take a holiday, and make it up afterward,''  (<font color='red'><b>the gentleman</b></font>)</div>said
the old gentleman. <div class="bookquote">``The good lady next door says he (<font color='blue'><b>Pilgrim</b></font>) is studying too
hard and needs young society, amusement, and exercise. I suspect she (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>)
is right, and that I've been coddling the fellow as if I'd been his (<font color='blue'><b>fellow</b></font>)
grandmother. Let him (<font color='blue'><b>fellow</b></font>) do what he (<font color='blue'><b>fellow</b></font>) likes, as long as he (<font color='blue'><b>fellow</b></font>) is happy. He (<font color='blue'><b>fellow</b></font>)
can't get into mischief in that little nunnery over there, and Mrs.
March is doing more for him (<font color='blue'><b>fellow</b></font>) than we can.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/>What good times they had, to be sure. Such plays and tableaux, such
sleigh rides and skating frolics, such pleasant evenings in the old
parlor, and now and then such gay little parties at the great house.
Meg could walk in the conservatory whenever she (<font color='blue'><b>Meg</b></font>) liked and revel in
bouquets, Jo browsed over the new library voraciously, and convulsed
the old gentleman with her (<font color='blue'><b>Jo</b></font>) criticisms, Amy copied pictures and enjoyed
beauty to her (<font color='blue'><b>Amy</b></font>) heart's content, and Laurie played `lord of the manor' in
the most delightful style.

<p/>But Beth, though yearning for the grand piano, could not pluck up
courage to go to the ``Mansion of Bliss', as Meg called it. She (<font color='blue'><b>Meg</b></font>) went
once with Jo, but the old gentleman, not being aware of her (<font color='blue'><b>Meg</b></font>) infirmity,
stared at her (<font color='blue'><b>Meg</b></font>) so hard from under his (<font color='blue'><b>gentleman</b></font>) heavy eyebrows, and said <div class="bookquote">``Hey!''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>so
loud, that he (<font color='blue'><b>Laurie</b></font>) frightened her (<font color='blue'><b>Beth</b></font>) so much her (<font color='blue'><b>Beth</b></font>) `feet chattered on the floor',
she (<font color='blue'><b>Beth</b></font>) never told her (<font color='blue'><b>Beth</b></font>) mother, and she (<font color='blue'><b>Beth</b></font>) ran away, declaring she (<font color='blue'><b>Beth</b></font>) would never
go there any more, not even for the dear piano. No persuasions or
enticements could overcome her (<font color='blue'><b>Beth</b></font>) fear, till, the fact coming to Mr.
Laurence's ear in some mysterious way, he (<font color='blue'><b>Laurence</b></font>) set about mending matters.
During one of the brief calls he (<font color='blue'><b>Laurence</b></font>) made, he (<font color='blue'><b>Laurence</b></font>) artfully led the conversation
to music, and talked away about great singers whom he (<font color='blue'><b>Laurence</b></font>) had seen, fine
organs he (<font color='blue'><b>Laurence</b></font>) had heard, and told such charming anecdotes that Beth found
it impossible to stay in her (<font color='blue'><b>Beth</b></font>) distant corner, but crept nearer and
nearer, as if fascinated. At the back of his (<font color='blue'><b>Laurence</b></font>) chair she (<font color='blue'><b>Beth</b></font>) stopped and
stood listening, with her (<font color='blue'><b>Beth</b></font>) great eyes wide open and her (<font color='blue'><b>Beth</b></font>) cheeks red with
excitement of this unusual performance. Taking no more notice of her (<font color='blue'><b>Beth</b></font>)
than if she (<font color='blue'><b>Beth</b></font>) had been a fly, Mr. Laurence talked on about Laurie's
lessons and teachers. And presently, as if the idea had just occurred
to him (<font color='blue'><b>Laurence</b></font>), he (<font color='blue'><b>Laurence</b></font>) said to Mrs. March...

<p/><div class="bookquote">``The boy neglects his (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>) music now, and I'm glad of it, for he (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>) was getting
too fond of it. But the piano suffers for want of use. Wouldn't some
of your girls like to run over, and practice on it now and then, just
to keep it in tune, you know, ma'am?''

 (<font color='red'><b>Beth</b></font>)</div><p/>Beth took a step forward, and pressed her (<font color='blue'><b>Beth</b></font>) hands tightly together to
keep from clapping them, for this was an irresistible temptation, and
the thought of practicing on that splendid instrument quite took her (<font color='blue'><b>Beth</b></font>)
breath away. Before Mrs. March could reply, Mr. Laurence went on with
an odd little nod and smile...

<p/><div class="bookquote">``They needn't see or speak to anyone, but run in at any time. For I'm
shut up in my study at the other end of the house, Laurie is out a
great deal, and the servants are never near the drawing room after nine
o'clock.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Laurence/Laurence/LAURENCE</b></font>)</div><p/>Here he (<font color='blue'><b>Laurence</b></font>) rose, as if going, and Beth made up her (<font color='blue'><b>Beth</b></font>) mind to speak, for that
last arrangement left nothing to be desired. <div class="bookquote">``Please, tell the young
ladies what I say, and if they don't care to come, why, never mind.''
 (<font color='red'><b>Beth</b></font>)</div>Here a little hand slipped into his (<font color='blue'><b>Laurence</b></font>), and Beth looked up at him (<font color='blue'><b>Laurence</b></font>) with a
face full of gratitude, as she (<font color='blue'><b>Beth</b></font>) said, in her (<font color='blue'><b>Beth</b></font>) earnest yet timid way...

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Oh sir, they do care, very very much!''

 (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Are you the musical girl?''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Laurence</b></font>) asked, without any startling <div class="bookquote">``Hey!''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>as
he (<font color='blue'><b>Laurence</b></font>) looked down at her (<font color='blue'><b>Beth</b></font>) very kindly.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``I'm Beth. I love it dearly, and I'll come, if you are quite sure
nobody will hear me, and be disturbed,''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Beth</b></font>) added, fearing to be rude,
and trembling at her (<font color='blue'><b>Beth</b></font>) own boldness as she (<font color='blue'><b>Beth</b></font>) spoke.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Not a soul, my dear. The house is empty half the day, so come and
drum away as much as you like, and I shall be obliged to you.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``How kind you are, sir!''

 (<font color='red'><b>Beth</b></font>)</div><p/>Beth blushed like a rose under the friendly look he (<font color='blue'><b>Laurence</b></font>) wore, but she (<font color='blue'><b>Beth</b></font>) was
not frightened now, and gave the hand a grateful squeeze because she (<font color='blue'><b>Beth</b></font>)
had no words to thank him (<font color='blue'><b>Laurence</b></font>) for the precious gift he (<font color='blue'><b>Laurence</b></font>) had given her (<font color='blue'><b>Beth</b></font>). The
old gentleman softly stroked the hair off her (<font color='blue'><b>Beth</b></font>) forehead, and, stooping
down, he (<font color='blue'><b>gentleman</b></font>) kissed her (<font color='blue'><b>Beth</b></font>), saying, in a tone few people ever heard...

<p/><div class="bookquote">``I had a little girl once, with eyes like these. God bless you, my
dear! Good day, madam.''  (<font color='red'><b>people</b></font>)</div>And away he (<font color='blue'><b>gentleman</b></font>) went, in a great hurry.

<p/>Beth had a rapture with her (<font color='blue'><b>Beth</b></font>) mother, and then rushed up to impart the
glorious news to her (<font color='blue'><b>Beth</b></font>) family of invalids, as the girls were not home.
How blithely she (<font color='blue'><b>Beth</b></font>) sang that evening, and how they all laughed at her (<font color='blue'><b>Beth</b></font>)
because she (<font color='blue'><b>Beth</b></font>) woke Amy in the night by playing the piano on her (<font color='blue'><b>Beth</b></font>) face in
her (<font color='blue'><b>Beth</b></font>) sleep. Next day, having seen both the old and young gentleman out
of the house, Beth, after two or three retreats, fairly got in at the
side door, and made her (<font color='blue'><b>Beth</b></font>) way as noiselessly as any mouse to the drawing
room where her (<font color='blue'><b>Beth</b></font>) idol stood. Quite by accident, of course, some pretty,
easy music lay on the piano, and with trembling fingers and frequent
stops to listen and look about, Beth at last touched the great
instrument, and straightway forgot her (<font color='blue'><b>Beth</b></font>) fear, herself, and everything
else but the unspeakable delight which the music gave her (<font color='blue'><b>Beth</b></font>), for it was
like the voice of a beloved friend.

<p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>Beth</b></font>) stayed till Hannah came to take her (<font color='blue'><b>Beth</b></font>) home to dinner, but she (<font color='blue'><b>Beth</b></font>) had no
appetite, and could only sit and smile upon everyone in a general state
of beatitude.

<p/>After that, the little brown hood slipped through the hedge nearly
every day, and the great drawing room was haunted by a tuneful spirit
that came and went unseen. She (<font color='blue'><b>Beth</b></font>) never knew that Mr. Laurence opened his (<font color='blue'><b>Laurence</b></font>)
study door to hear the old-fashioned airs he (<font color='blue'><b>Laurence</b></font>) liked. She (<font color='blue'><b>Beth</b></font>) never saw
Laurie mount guard in the hall to warn the servants away. She (<font color='blue'><b>Beth</b></font>) never
suspected that the exercise books and new songs which she (<font color='blue'><b>Beth</b></font>) found in the
rack were put there for her (<font color='blue'><b>Beth</b></font>) especial benefit, and when he (<font color='blue'><b>Laurie</b></font>) talked to her (<font color='blue'><b>Beth</b></font>)
about music at home, she (<font color='blue'><b>Beth</b></font>) only thought how kind he (<font color='blue'><b>Laurie</b></font>) was to tell things
that helped her (<font color='blue'><b>Beth</b></font>) so much. So she (<font color='blue'><b>Beth</b></font>) enjoyed herself heartily, and found,
what isn't always the case, that her (<font color='blue'><b>Beth</b></font>) granted wish was all she (<font color='blue'><b>Beth</b></font>) had
hoped. Perhaps it was because she (<font color='blue'><b>Beth</b></font>) was so grateful for this blessing
that a greater was given her (<font color='blue'><b>Beth</b></font>). At any rate she (<font color='blue'><b>Beth</b></font>) deserved both.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Mother, I'm going to work Mr. Laurence a pair of slippers. He (<font color='blue'><b>Laurence</b></font>) is so
kind to me, I must thank him (<font color='blue'><b>Laurence</b></font>), and I don't know any other way. Can I do
it?''  (<font color='red'><b>Beth</b></font>)</div>asked Beth, a few weeks after that eventful call of his (<font color='blue'><b>Laurie</b></font>).

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Yes, dear. It will please him (<font color='blue'><b>Laurence</b></font>) very much, and be a nice way of
thanking him (<font color='blue'><b>Laurence</b></font>). The girls will help you about them, and I will pay for
the making up,''  (<font color='red'><b>Beth</b></font>)</div>replied Mrs. March, who took peculiar pleasure in
granting Beth's requests because she (<font color='blue'><b>Beth</b></font>) so seldom asked anything for
herself.

<p/>After many serious discussions with Meg and Jo, the pattern was chosen,
the materials bought, and the slippers begun. A cluster of grave yet
cheerful pansies on a deeper purple ground was pronounced very
appropriate and pretty, and Beth worked away early and late, with
occasional lifts over hard parts. She (<font color='blue'><b>Beth</b></font>) was a nimble little needlewoman,
and they were finished before anyone got tired of them. Then she (<font color='blue'><b>Beth</b></font>) wrote
a short, simple note, and with Laurie's help, got them smuggled onto
the study table one morning before the old gentleman was up.

<p/>When this excitement was over, Beth waited to see what would happen.
All day passed and a part of the next before any acknowledgement
arrived, and she (<font color='blue'><b>Beth</b></font>) was beginning to fear she (<font color='blue'><b>Beth</b></font>) had offended her (<font color='blue'><b>Beth</b></font>) crochety
friend. On the afternoon of the second day, she (<font color='blue'><b>Beth</b></font>) went out to do an
errand, and give poor Joanna, the invalid doll, her (<font color='blue'><b>Joanna</b></font>) daily exercise. As
she (<font color='blue'><b>Joanna</b></font>) came up the street, on her (<font color='blue'><b>Joanna</b></font>) return, she (<font color='blue'><b>Joanna</b></font>) saw three, yes, four heads
popping in and out of the parlor windows, and the moment they saw her (<font color='blue'><b>Joanna</b></font>),
several hands were waved, and several joyful voices screamed...

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Here's a letter from the old gentleman! Come quick, and read it!''

 (<font color='red'><b>her</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Oh, Beth, he (<font color='blue'><b>gentleman</b></font>)'s sent you...''  (<font color='red'><b>Amy/Amy March</b></font>)</div>began Amy, gesticulating with unseemly
energy, but she (<font color='blue'><b>Amy</b></font>) got no further, for Jo quenched her (<font color='blue'><b>Jo</b></font>) by slamming down
the window.

<p/>Beth hurried on in a flutter of suspense. At the door her (<font color='blue'><b>Beth</b></font>) sisters
seized and bore her (<font color='blue'><b>Beth</b></font>) to the parlor in a triumphal procession, all
pointing and all saying at once, <div class="bookquote">``Look there! Look there!''  (<font color='red'><b>her</b></font>)</div>Beth did
look, and turned pale with delight and surprise, for there stood a
little cabinet piano, with a letter lying on the glossy lid, directed
like a sign board to <div class="bookquote">``Miss Elizabeth March.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Beth</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``For me?''  (<font color='red'><b>Beth</b></font>)</div>gasped Beth, holding onto Jo and feeling as if she (<font color='blue'><b>Beth</b></font>) should
tumble down, it was such an overwhelming thing altogether.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Yes, all for you, my precious! Isn't it splendid of him (<font color='blue'><b>gentleman</b></font>)? Don't you
think he (<font color='blue'><b>gentleman</b></font>)'s the dearest old man in the world? Here's the key in the
letter. We didn't open it, but we are dying to know what he (<font color='blue'><b>gentleman</b></font>) says,''
 (<font color='red'><b>Jo/Miss Jo/JO</b></font>)</div>cried Jo, hugging her (<font color='blue'><b>Jo</b></font>) sister and offering the note.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``You read it! I can't, I feel so queer! Oh, it is too lovely!''  (<font color='red'><b>Beth</b></font>)</div>and
Beth hid her (<font color='blue'><b>Beth</b></font>) face in Jo's apron, quite upset by her (<font color='blue'><b>Beth</b></font>) present.

<p/>Jo opened the paper and began to laugh, for the first words she (<font color='blue'><b>Jo</b></font>) saw
were...

<p/>``Miss March: <div class="bookquote">``Dear Madam--''

 (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``How nice it sounds! I wish someone would write to me so!''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>said Amy,
who thought the old-fashioned address very elegant.

<p/><div class="bookquote">'''I have had many pairs of slippers in my life, but I never had any
that suited me so well as yours,'''  (<font color='red'><b>Amy/Amy March</b></font>)</div>continues Jo. <div class="bookquote">''`Heart's-ease is my
favorite flower, and these will always remind me of the gentle giver.
I like to pay my debts, so I know you will allow `the old gentleman' to
send you something which once belonged to the little grand daughter he (<font color='blue'><b>gentleman</b></font>)
lost. With hearty thanks and best wishes, I remain '' (<font color='red'><b>Jo/Miss Jo/JO</b></font>)</div>`Your grateful
friend and humble servant, <div class="bookquote">``JAMES LAURENCE'.''

 (<font color='red'><b>servant</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``There, Beth, that's an honor to be proud of, I'm sure! Laurie told me
how fond Mr. Laurence used to be of the child who died, and how he (<font color='blue'><b>Laurence</b></font>) kept
all her (<font color='blue'><b>Beth</b></font>) little things carefully. Just think, he (<font color='blue'><b>Laurence</b></font>)'s given you her (<font color='blue'><b>Beth</b></font>) piano.
That comes of having big blue eyes and loving music,''  (<font color='red'><b>Jo/Miss Jo/JO</b></font>)</div>said Jo, trying
to soothe Beth, who trembled and looked more excited than she (<font color='blue'><b>Jo</b></font>) had ever
been before.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``See the cunning brackets to hold candles, and the nice green silk,
puckered up, with a gold rose in the middle, and the pretty rack and
stool, all complete,''  (<font color='red'><b>Meg</b></font>)</div>added Meg, opening the instrument and displaying
its beauties.

<p/><div class="bookquote">''`Your humble servant, James Laurence'. Only think of his (<font color='blue'><b>Laurence</b></font>) writing that
to you. I'll tell the girls. They'll think it's splendid,''  (<font color='red'><b>Meg</b></font>)</div>said Amy,
much impressed by the note.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Try it, honey. Let's hear the sound of the baby pianny,''  (<font color='red'><b>Hannah</b></font>)</div>said Hannah,
who always took a share in the family joys and sorrows.

<p/>So Beth tried it, and everyone pronounced it the most remarkable piano
ever heard. It had evidently been newly tuned and put in apple-pie
order, but, perfect as it was, I think the real charm lay in the
happiest of all happy faces which leaned over it, as Beth lovingly
touched the beautiful black and white keys and pressed the bright
pedals.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``You'll have to go and thank him (<font color='blue'><b>Laurence</b></font>),''  (<font color='red'><b>Jo/Miss Jo/JO</b></font>)</div>said Jo, by way of a joke, for the
idea of the child's really going never entered her (<font color='blue'><b>Jo</b></font>) head.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Yes, I mean to. I guess I'll go now, before I get frightened thinking
about it.''  (<font color='red'><b>the family</b></font>)</div>And, to the utter amazement of the assembled family, Beth
walked deliberately down the garden, through the hedge, and in at the
Laurences' door.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Well, I wish I may die if it ain't the queerest thing I ever see! The
pianny has turned her (<font color='blue'><b>it</b></font>) head! She (<font color='blue'><b>it</b></font>)'d never have gone in her (<font color='blue'><b>it</b></font>) right mind,''
 (<font color='red'><b>Hannah</b></font>)</div>cried Hannah, staring after her (<font color='blue'><b>Hannah</b></font>), while the girls were rendered quite
speechless by the miracle.

<p/>They would have been still more amazed if they had seen what Beth did
afterward. If you will believe me, she (<font color='blue'><b>Beth</b></font>) went and knocked at the study
door before she (<font color='blue'><b>Beth</b></font>) gave herself time to think, and when a gruff voice
called out, <div class="bookquote">``come in!''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Beth</b></font>) did go in, right up to Mr. Laurence, who
looked quite taken aback, and held out her (<font color='blue'><b>Beth</b></font>) hand, saying, with only a
small quaver in her (<font color='blue'><b>Beth</b></font>) voice, <div class="bookquote">``I came to thank you, sir, for...''  (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Laurence/Laurence/LAURENCE</b></font>)</div>But she (<font color='blue'><b>Beth</b></font>)
didn't finish, for he (<font color='blue'><b>Laurence</b></font>) looked so friendly that she (<font color='blue'><b>Beth</b></font>) forgot her (<font color='blue'><b>Beth</b></font>) speech
and, only remembering that he (<font color='blue'><b>Laurence</b></font>) had lost the little girl he (<font color='blue'><b>Laurence</b></font>) loved, she (<font color='blue'><b>Beth</b></font>)
put both arms round his (<font color='blue'><b>Laurence</b></font>) neck and kissed him (<font color='blue'><b>Laurence</b></font>).

<p/>If the roof of the house had suddenly flown off, the old gentleman
wouldn't have been more astonished. But he (<font color='blue'><b>gentleman</b></font>) liked it. Oh, dear, yes, he (<font color='blue'><b>gentleman</b></font>)
liked it amazingly! And was so touched and pleased by that confiding
little kiss that all his (<font color='blue'><b>gentleman</b></font>) crustiness vanished, and he (<font color='blue'><b>gentleman</b></font>) just set her (<font color='blue'><b>Beth</b></font>) on
his (<font color='blue'><b>gentleman</b></font>) knee, and laid his (<font color='blue'><b>gentleman</b></font>) wrinkled cheek against her (<font color='blue'><b>Beth</b></font>) rosy one, feeling as
if he (<font color='blue'><b>gentleman</b></font>) had got his (<font color='blue'><b>gentleman</b></font>) own little granddaughter back again. Beth ceased to
fear him (<font color='blue'><b>gentleman</b></font>) from that moment, and sat there talking to him (<font color='blue'><b>gentleman</b></font>) as cozily as if
she (<font color='blue'><b>Beth</b></font>) had known him (<font color='blue'><b>gentleman</b></font>) all her (<font color='blue'><b>Beth</b></font>) life, for love casts out fear, and gratitude
can conquer pride. When she (<font color='blue'><b>Beth</b></font>) went home, he (<font color='blue'><b>gentleman</b></font>) walked with her (<font color='blue'><b>Beth</b></font>) to her (<font color='blue'><b>Beth</b></font>) own
gate, shook hands cordially, and touched his (<font color='blue'><b>gentleman</b></font>) hat as he (<font color='blue'><b>gentleman</b></font>) marched back
again, looking very stately and erect, like a handsome, soldierly old
gentleman, as he (<font color='blue'><b>gentleman</b></font>) was.

<p/>When the girls saw that performance, Jo began to dance a jig, by way of
expressing her (<font color='blue'><b>Jo</b></font>) satisfaction, Amy nearly fell out of the window in her (<font color='blue'><b>Amy</b></font>)
surprise, and Meg exclaimed, with up-lifted hands, <div class="bookquote">``Well, I do believe
the world is coming to an end.''



 (<font color='red'><b>Meg</b></font>)</div><p/>CHAPTER SEVEN

<p/>AMY``S VALLEY OF HUMILIATION

<p/><div class="bookquote">``That boy is a perfect cyclops, isn't he (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>)?''  (<font color='red'><b>Amy/Amy March</b></font>)</div>said Amy one day, as Laurie
clattered by on horseback, with a flourish of his (<font color='blue'><b>Laurie</b></font>) whip as he (<font color='blue'><b>Laurie</b></font>) passed.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``How dare you say so, when he (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>)'s got both his (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>) eyes? And very handsome
ones they are, too,''  (<font color='red'><b>Jo/Miss Jo/JO</b></font>)</div>cried Jo, who resented any slighting remarks about
her (<font color='blue'><b>Jo</b></font>) friend.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``I didn't say anything about his (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>) eyes, and I don't see why you need
fire up when I admire his (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>) riding.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Oh, my goodness! That little goose means a centaur, and she (<font color='blue'><b>cyclops</b></font>) called
him (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>) a Cyclops,''  (<font color='red'><b>Jo/Miss Jo/JO</b></font>)</div>exclaimed Jo, with a burst of laughter.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``You needn't be so rude, it's only a `lapse of lingy', as Mr. Davis
says,''  (<font color='red'><b>Amy/Amy March</b></font>)</div>retorted Amy, finishing Jo with her (<font color='blue'><b>Jo</b></font>) Latin. <div class="bookquote">``I just wish I had a
little of the money Laurie spends on that horse,''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Jo</b></font>) added, as if to
herself, yet hoping her (<font color='blue'><b>Jo</b></font>) sisters would hear.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Why?''  (<font color='red'><b>Meg</b></font>)</div>asked Meg kindly, for Jo had gone off in another laugh at Amy's
second blunder.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``I need it so much. I'm dreadfully in debt, and it won't be my turn to
have the rag money for a month.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``In debt, Amy? What do you mean?''  (<font color='red'><b>Meg</b></font>)</div>And Meg looked sober.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Why, I owe at least a dozen pickled limes, and I can't pay them, you
know, till I have money, for Marmee forbade my having anything charged
at the shop.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Tell me all about it. Are limes the fashion now? It used to be
pricking bits of rubber to make balls.''  (<font color='red'><b>Meg</b></font>)</div>And Meg tried to keep her (<font color='blue'><b>Meg</b></font>)
countenance, Amy looked so grave and important.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Why, you see, the girls are always buying them, and unless you want to
be thought mean, you must do it too. It's nothing but limes now, for
everyone is sucking them in their desks in schooltime, and trading them
off for pencils, bead rings, paper dolls, or something else, at recess.
If one girl likes another, she (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) gives her (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) a lime. If she (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>)'s mad with
her (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>), she (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) eats one before her (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) face, and doesn't offer even a suck. They
treat by turns, and I've had ever so many but haven't returned them,
and I ought for they are debts of honor, you know.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``How much will pay them off and restore your credit?''  (<font color='red'><b>Meg</b></font>)</div>asked Meg, taking
out her (<font color='blue'><b>Amy</b></font>) purse.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``A quarter would more than do it, and leave a few cents over for a
treat for you. Don't you like limes?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Not much. You may have my share. Here's the money. Make it last as
long as you can, for it isn't very plenty, you know.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Oh, thank you! It must be so nice to have pocket money! I'll have a
grand feast, for I haven't tasted a lime this week. I felt delicate
about taking any, as I couldn't return them, and I'm actually suffering
for one.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Amy/Amy March</b></font>)</div><p/>Next day Amy was rather late at school, but could not resist the
temptation of displaying, with pardonable pride, a moist brown-paper
parcel, before she (<font color='blue'><b>Amy</b></font>) consigned it to the inmost recesses of her (<font color='blue'><b>Amy</b></font>) desk.
During the next few minutes the rumor that Amy March had got
twenty-four delicious limes -LRB-she (<font color='blue'><b>March</b></font>) ate one on the way-RRB- and was going to
treat circulated through her (<font color='blue'><b>March</b></font>) `set', and the attentions of her (<font color='blue'><b>March</b></font>) friends
became quite overwhelming. Katy Brown invited her (<font color='blue'><b>March</b></font>) to her (<font color='blue'><b>March</b></font>) next party on
the spot. Mary Kingsley insisted on lending her (<font color='blue'><b>March</b></font>) her (<font color='blue'><b>March</b></font>) watch till recess,
and Jenny Snow, a satirical young lady, who had basely twitted Amy upon
her (<font color='blue'><b>Amy</b></font>) limeless state, promptly buried the hatchet and offered to furnish
answers to certain appalling sums. But Amy had not forgotten Miss
Snow's cutting remarks about `some persons whose noses were not too
flat to smell other people's limes, and stuck-up people who were not
too proud to ask for them', and she (<font color='blue'><b>Amy</b></font>) instantly crushed `that Snow
girl's' hopes by the withering telegram, <div class="bookquote">``You needn't be so polite all
of a sudden, for you won't get any.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Snow girl</b></font>)</div><p/>A distinguished personage happened to visit the school that morning,
and Amy's beautifully drawn maps received praise, which honor to her (<font color='blue'><b>Amy</b></font>)
foe rankled in the soul of Miss Snow, and caused Miss March to assume
the airs of a studious young peacock. But, alas, alas! Pride goes
before a fall, and the revengeful Snow turned the tables with
disastrous success. No sooner had the guest paid the usual stale
compliments and bowed himself out, than Jenny, under pretense of asking
an important question, informed Mr. Davis, the teacher, that Amy March
had pickled limes in her (<font color='blue'><b>March</b></font>) desk.

<p/>Now Mr. Davis had declared limes a contraband article, and solemnly
vowed to publicly ferrule the first person who was found breaking the
law. This much-enduring man had succeeded in banishing chewing gum
after a long and stormy war, had made a bonfire of the confiscated
novels and newspapers, had suppressed a private post office, had
forbidden distortions of the face, nicknames, and caricatures, and done
all that one man could do to keep half a hundred rebellious girls in
order. Boys are trying enough to human patience, goodness knows, but
girls are infinitely more so, especially to nervous gentlemen with
tyrannical tempers and no more talent for teaching than Dr. Blimber.
Mr. Davis knew any quantity of Greek, Latin, algebra, and ologies of
all sorts so he (<font color='blue'><b>Davis</b></font>) was called a fine teacher, and manners, morals,
feelings, and examples were not considered of any particular
importance. It was a most unfortunate moment for denouncing Amy, and
Jenny knew it. Mr. Davis had evidently taken his (<font color='blue'><b>Davis</b></font>) coffee too strong
that morning, there was an east wind, which always affected his (<font color='blue'><b>Davis</b></font>)
neuralgia, and his (<font color='blue'><b>Davis</b></font>) pupils had not done him (<font color='blue'><b>Davis</b></font>) the credit which he (<font color='blue'><b>Davis</b></font>) felt he (<font color='blue'><b>Davis</b></font>)
deserved. Therefore, to use the expressive, if not elegant, language
of a schoolgirl, <div class="bookquote">``He (<font color='blue'><b>It</b></font>) was as nervous as a witch and as cross as a bear'' (<font color='red'><b>a schoolgirl</b></font>)</div>.
The word `limes' was like fire to powder, his (<font color='blue'><b>Davis</b></font>) yellow face flushed, and
he (<font color='blue'><b>Davis</b></font>) rapped on his (<font color='blue'><b>Davis</b></font>) desk with an energy which made Jenny skip to her (<font color='blue'><b>Jenny</b></font>) seat
with unusual rapidity.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Young ladies, attention, if you please!''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/>At the stern order the buzz ceased, and fifty pairs of blue, black,
gray, and brown eyes were obediently fixed upon his (<font color='blue'><b>Davis</b></font>) awful countenance.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Miss March, come to the desk.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Amy/Amy March</b></font>)</div><p/>Amy rose to comply with outward composure, but a secret fear oppressed
her (<font color='blue'><b>Amy</b></font>), for the limes weighed upon her (<font color='blue'><b>Amy</b></font>) conscience.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Bring with you the limes you have in your desk,''  (<font color='red'><b>her</b></font>)</div>was the unexpected
command which arrested her (<font color='blue'><b>Amy</b></font>) before she (<font color='blue'><b>Amy</b></font>) got out of her (<font color='blue'><b>Amy</b></font>) seat.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Don't take all.''  (<font color='red'><b>neighbor lady</b></font>)</div>whispered her (<font color='blue'><b>Amy</b></font>) neighbor, a young lady of great
presence of mind.

<p/>Amy hastily shook out half a dozen and laid the rest down before Mr.
Davis, feeling that any man possessing a human heart would relent when
that delicious perfume met his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) nose. Unfortunately, Mr. Davis
particularly detested the odor of the fashionable pickle, and disgust
added to his (<font color='blue'><b>Davis</b></font>) wrath.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Is that all?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Not quite,''  (<font color='red'><b>Amy/Amy March</b></font>)</div>stammered Amy.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Bring the rest immediately.''

 (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div><p/>With a despairing glance at her (<font color='blue'><b>Amy</b></font>) set, she (<font color='blue'><b>Amy</b></font>) obeyed.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``You are sure there are no more?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I never lie, sir.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``So I see. Now take these disgusting things two by two, and throw them
out of the window.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/>There was a simultaneous sigh, which created quite a little gust, as
the last hope fled, and the treat was ravished from their longing lips.
Scarlet with shame and anger, Amy went to and fro six dreadful times,
and as each doomed couple, looking oh, so plump and juicy, fell from
her (<font color='blue'><b>Amy</b></font>) reluctant hands, a shout from the street completed the anguish of
the girls, for it told them that their feast was being exulted over by
the little Irish children, who were their sworn foes. This--this was
too much. All flashed indignant or appealing glances at the inexorable
Davis, and one passionate lime lover burst into tears.

<p/>As Amy returned from her (<font color='blue'><b>Amy</b></font>) last trip, Mr. Davis gave a portentous <div class="bookquote">``Hem!''
 (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Davis/Davis</b></font>)</div>and said, in his (<font color='blue'><b>Davis</b></font>) most impressive manner...

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Young ladies, you remember what I said to you a week ago. I am sorry
this has happened, but I never allow my rules to be infringed, and I
never break my word. Miss March, hold out your hand.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Amy/Amy March</b></font>)</div><p/>Amy started, and put both hands behind her (<font color='blue'><b>Amy</b></font>), turning on him (<font color='blue'><b>Davis</b></font>) an imploring
look which pleaded for her (<font color='blue'><b>Amy</b></font>) better than the words she (<font color='blue'><b>Amy</b></font>) could not utter.
She (<font color='blue'><b>Amy</b></font>) was rather a favorite with `old Davis', as, of course, he (<font color='blue'><b>Davis</b></font>) was
called, and it's my private belief that he (<font color='blue'><b>Davis</b></font>) would have broken his (<font color='blue'><b>Davis</b></font>) word
if the indignation of one irrepressible young lady had not found vent
in a hiss. That hiss, faint as it was, irritated the irascible
gentleman, and sealed the culprit's fate.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Your hand, Miss March!''  (<font color='red'><b>Amy/Amy March</b></font>)</div>was the only answer her (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) mute appeal received,
and too proud to cry or beseech, Amy set her (<font color='blue'><b>Amy</b></font>) teeth, threw back her (<font color='blue'><b>Amy</b></font>) head
defiantly, and bore without flinching several tingling blows on her (<font color='blue'><b>Amy</b></font>)
little palm. They were neither many nor heavy, but that made no
difference to her (<font color='blue'><b>Amy</b></font>). For the first time in her (<font color='blue'><b>Amy</b></font>) life she (<font color='blue'><b>Amy</b></font>) had been struck,
and the disgrace, in her (<font color='blue'><b>Amy</b></font>) eyes, was as deep as if he (<font color='blue'><b>culprit</b></font>) had knocked her (<font color='blue'><b>Amy</b></font>)
down.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``You will now stand on the platform till recess,''  (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Davis/Davis</b></font>)</div>said Mr. Davis,
resolved to do the thing thoroughly, since he (<font color='blue'><b>Davis</b></font>) had begun.

<p/>That was dreadful. It would have been bad enough to go to her (<font color='blue'><b>Amy</b></font>) seat,
and see the pitying faces of her (<font color='blue'><b>Amy</b></font>) friends, or the satisfied ones of her (<font color='blue'><b>Amy</b></font>)
few enemies, but to face the whole school, with that shame fresh upon
her (<font color='blue'><b>Amy</b></font>), seemed impossible, and for a second she (<font color='blue'><b>Amy</b></font>) felt as if she (<font color='blue'><b>Amy</b></font>) could only
drop down where she (<font color='blue'><b>Amy</b></font>) stood, and break her (<font color='blue'><b>Amy</b></font>) heart with crying. A bitter
sense of wrong and the thought of Jenny Snow helped her (<font color='blue'><b>Snow</b></font>) to bear it,
and, taking the ignominious place, she (<font color='blue'><b>Snow</b></font>) fixed her (<font color='blue'><b>Snow</b></font>) eyes on the stove
funnel above what now seemed a sea of faces, and stood there, so
motionless and white that the girls found it hard to study with that
pathetic figure before them.

<p/>During the fifteen minutes that followed, the proud and sensitive
little girl suffered a shame and pain which she (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) never forgot. To
others it might seem a ludicrous or trivial affair, but to her (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) it was a
hard experience, for during the twelve years of her (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) life she (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) had been
governed by love alone, and a blow of that sort had never touched her (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>)
before. The smart of her (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) hand and the ache of her (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) heart were forgotten
in the sting of the thought, <div class="bookquote">``I shall have to tell at home, and they
will be so disappointed in me!''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/>The fifteen minutes seemed an hour, but they came to an end at last,
and the word <div class="bookquote">``Recess!''  (<font color='red'><b>her</b></font>)</div>had never seemed so welcome to her (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) before.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``You can go, Miss March,''  (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Davis/Davis</b></font>)</div>said Mr. Davis, looking, as he (<font color='blue'><b>Davis</b></font>) felt,
uncomfortable.

<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Davis</b></font>) did not soon forget the reproachful glance Amy gave him (<font color='blue'><b>Davis</b></font>), as she (<font color='blue'><b>Amy</b></font>)
went, without a word to anyone, straight into the anteroom, snatched
her (<font color='blue'><b>Amy</b></font>) things, and left the place <div class="bookquote">``forever,''  (<font color='red'><b>anyone</b></font>)</div>as she (<font color='blue'><b>Amy</b></font>) passionately declared
to herself. She (<font color='blue'><b>Amy</b></font>) was in a sad state when she (<font color='blue'><b>Amy</b></font>) got home, and when the
older girls arrived, some time later, an indignation meeting was held
at once. Mrs. March did not say much but looked disturbed, and
comforted her (<font color='blue'><b>Amy</b></font>) afflicted little daughter in her (<font color='blue'><b>Amy</b></font>) tenderest manner. Meg
bathed the insulted hand with glycerine and tears, Beth felt that even
her (<font color='blue'><b>Beth</b></font>) beloved kittens would fail as a balm for griefs like this, Jo
wrathfully proposed that Mr. Davis be arrested without delay, and
Hannah shook her (<font color='blue'><b>Hannah</b></font>) fist at the `villain' and pounded potatoes for dinner
as if she (<font color='blue'><b>Hannah</b></font>) had him (<font color='blue'><b>Davis</b></font>) under her (<font color='blue'><b>Hannah</b></font>) pestle.

<p/>No notice was taken of Amy's flight, except by her (<font color='blue'><b>Amy</b></font>) mates, but the
sharp-eyed demoiselles discovered that Mr. Davis was quite benignant in
the afternoon, also unusually nervous. Just before school closed, Jo
appeared, wearing a grim expression as she (<font color='blue'><b>Jo</b></font>) stalked up to the desk, and
delivered a letter from her (<font color='blue'><b>Jo</b></font>) mother, then collected Amy's property, and
departed, carefully scraping the mud from her (<font color='blue'><b>Jo</b></font>) boots on the door mat, as
if she (<font color='blue'><b>Jo</b></font>) shook the dust of the place off her (<font color='blue'><b>Jo</b></font>) feet.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Yes, you can have a vacation from school, but I want you to study a
little every day with Beth,''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>said Mrs. March that evening. <div class="bookquote">``I don't
approve of corporal punishment, especially for girls. I dislike Mr.
Davis's manner of teaching and don't think the girls you associate with
are doing you any good, so I shall ask your father's advice before I
send you anywhere else.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``That's good! I wish all the girls would leave, and spoil his (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) old
school. It's perfectly maddening to think of those lovely limes,''
 (<font color='red'><b>Amy/Amy March</b></font>)</div>sighed Amy, with the air of a martyr.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``I am not sorry you lost them, for you broke the rules, and deserved
some punishment for disobedience,''  (<font color='red'><b>the lady</b></font>)</div>was the severe reply, which rather
disappointed the young lady, who expected nothing but sympathy.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Do you mean you are glad I was disgraced before the whole school?''
 (<font color='red'><b>Amy/Amy March</b></font>)</div>cried Amy.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``I should not have chosen that way of mending a fault,''  (<font color='red'><b>mother</b></font>)</div>replied her (<font color='blue'><b>Amy</b></font>)
mother, <div class="bookquote">``but I'm not sure that it won't do you more good than a bolder
method. You are getting to be rather conceited, my dear, and it is
quite time you set about correcting it. You have a good many little
gifts and virtues, but there is no need of parading them, for conceit
spoils the finest genius. There is not much danger that real talent or
goodness will be overlooked long, even if it is, the consciousness of
possessing and using it well should satisfy one, and the great charm of
all power is modesty.''

 (<font color='red'><b>mother</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``So it is!''  (<font color='red'><b>Laurie/Mr. Laurie/LAURIE</b></font>)</div>cried Laurie, who was playing chess in a corner with Jo.
<div class="bookquote">``I knew a girl once, who had a really remarkable talent for music, and
she (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) didn't know it, never guessed what sweet little things she (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) composed
when she (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) was alone, and wouldn't have believed it if anyone had told
her (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>).''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I wish I'd known that nice girl. Maybe she (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) would have helped me, I'm
so stupid,''  (<font color='red'><b>Beth</b></font>)</div>said Beth, who stood beside him (<font color='blue'><b>Laurie</b></font>), listening eagerly.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``You do know her (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>), and she (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) helps you better than anyone else could,''
 (<font color='red'><b>Laurie/Mr. Laurie/LAURIE</b></font>)</div>answered Laurie, looking at her (<font color='blue'><b>Beth</b></font>) with such mischievous meaning in his (<font color='blue'><b>Laurie</b></font>)
merry black eyes that Beth suddenly turned very red, and hid her (<font color='blue'><b>Beth</b></font>) face
in the sofa cushion, quite overcome by such an unexpected discovery.

<p/>Jo let Laurie win the game to pay for that praise of her (<font color='blue'><b>Laurie</b></font>) Beth, who
could not be prevailed upon to play for them after her (<font color='blue'><b>Laurie</b></font>) compliment. So
Laurie did his (<font color='blue'><b>Laurie</b></font>) best, and sang delightfully, being in a particularly
lively humor, for to the Marches he (<font color='blue'><b>Laurie</b></font>) seldom showed the moody side of his (<font color='blue'><b>Laurie</b></font>)
character. When he (<font color='blue'><b>Laurie</b></font>) was gone, Amy, who had been pensive all evening,
said suddenly, as if busy over some new idea, <div class="bookquote">``Is Laurie an
accomplished boy?''

 (<font color='red'><b>Amy/Amy March</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Yes, he (<font color='blue'><b>Laurie</b></font>) has had an excellent education, and has much talent. He (<font color='blue'><b>Laurie</b></font>) will
make a fine man, if not spoiled by petting,''  (<font color='red'><b>mother</b></font>)</div>replied her (<font color='blue'><b>Amy</b></font>) mother.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``And he (<font color='blue'><b>Laurie</b></font>) isn't conceited, is he (<font color='blue'><b>Laurie</b></font>)?''  (<font color='red'><b>Amy/Amy March</b></font>)</div>asked Amy.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Not in the least. That is why he (<font color='blue'><b>Laurie</b></font>) is so charming and we all like him (<font color='blue'><b>Laurie</b></font>)
so much.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I see. It's nice to have accomplishments and be elegant, but not to
show off or get perked up,''  (<font color='red'><b>Amy/Amy March</b></font>)</div>said Amy thoughtfully.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``These things are always seen and felt in a person's manner and
conversations, if modestly used, but it is not necessary to display
them,''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>said Mrs. March.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Any more than it's proper to wear all your bonnets and gowns and
ribbons at once, that folks may know you've got them,''  (<font color='red'><b>Jo/Miss Jo/JO</b></font>)</div>added Jo, and
the lecture ended in a laugh.



<p/>CHAPTER EIGHT

<p/>JO MEETS APOLLYON

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Girls, where are you going?''  (<font color='red'><b>Amy/Amy March</b></font>)</div>asked Amy, coming into their room one
Saturday afternoon, and finding them getting ready to go out with an
air of secrecy which excited her (<font color='blue'><b>Amy</b></font>) curiosity.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Never mind. Little girls shouldn't ask questions,''  (<font color='red'><b>Jo/Miss Jo/JO</b></font>)</div>returned Jo
sharply.

<p/>Now if there is anything mortifying to our feelings when we are young,
it is to be told that, and to be bidden to <div class="bookquote">``run away, dear''  (<font color='red'><b>Amy/Amy March</b></font>)</div>is still
more trying to us. Amy bridled up at this insult, and determined to
find out the secret, if she (<font color='blue'><b>Amy</b></font>) teased for an hour. Turning to Meg, who
never refused her (<font color='blue'><b>Meg</b></font>) anything very long, she (<font color='blue'><b>Meg</b></font>) said coaxingly, <div class="bookquote">``Do tell me!
I should think you might let me go, too, for Beth is fussing over her (<font color='blue'><b>Beth</b></font>)
piano, and I haven't got anything to do, and am so lonely.''

 (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I can't, dear, because you aren't invited,''  (<font color='red'><b>Meg</b></font>)</div>began Meg, but Jo broke in
impatiently, <div class="bookquote">``Now, Meg, be quiet or you will spoil it all. You can't
go, Amy, so don't be a baby and whine about it.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Jo/Miss Jo/JO</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``You are going somewhere with Laurie, I know you are. You were
whispering and laughing together on the sofa last night, and you
stopped when I came in. Aren't you going with him (<font color='blue'><b>Laurie</b></font>)?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Yes, we are. Now do be still, and stop bothering.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Amy/Amy March</b></font>)</div><p/>Amy held her (<font color='blue'><b>Amy</b></font>) tongue, but used her (<font color='blue'><b>Amy</b></font>) eyes, and saw Meg slip a fan into her (<font color='blue'><b>Meg</b></font>)
pocket.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``I know! I know! You're going to the theater to see the _Seven
Castles!_''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Meg</b></font>) cried, adding resolutely, <div class="bookquote">``and I shall go, for Mother
said I might see it, and I've got my rag money, and it was mean not to
tell me in time.''

 (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Just listen to me a minute, and be a good child,''  (<font color='red'><b>Meg</b></font>)</div>said Meg soothingly.
<div class="bookquote">``Mother doesn't wish you to go this week, because your eyes are not
well enough yet to bear the light of this fairy piece. Next week you
can go with Beth and Hannah, and have a nice time.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I don't like that half as well as going with you and Laurie. Please
let me. I've been sick with this cold so long, and shut up, I'm dying
for some fun. Do, Meg! I'll be ever so good,''  (<font color='red'><b>Amy/Amy March</b></font>)</div>pleaded Amy, looking as
pathetic as she (<font color='blue'><b>Meg</b></font>) could.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Suppose we take her (<font color='blue'><b>Meg</b></font>). I don't believe Mother would mind, if we bundle
her (<font color='blue'><b>Mother</b></font>) up well,''  (<font color='red'><b>Meg</b></font>)</div>began Meg.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``If she (<font color='blue'><b>Mother</b></font>) goes I shan't, and if I don't, Laurie won't like it, and it
will be very rude, after he (<font color='blue'><b>Laurie</b></font>) invited only us, to go and drag in Amy. I
should think she (<font color='blue'><b>Amy</b></font>)'d hate to poke herself where she (<font color='blue'><b>Amy</b></font>) isn't wanted,''  (<font color='red'><b>Jo/Miss Jo/JO</b></font>)</div>said
Jo crossly, for she (<font color='blue'><b>Meg</b></font>) disliked the trouble of overseeing a fidgety child
when she (<font color='blue'><b>Meg</b></font>) wanted to enjoy herself.

<p/>Her (<font color='blue'><b>Meg</b></font>) tone and manner angered Amy, who began to put her (<font color='blue'><b>Amy</b></font>) boots on, saying,
in her (<font color='blue'><b>Amy</b></font>) most aggravating way, <div class="bookquote">``I shall go. Meg says I may, and if I pay
for myself, Laurie hasn't anything to do with it.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Amy/Amy March</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``You can't sit with us, for our seats are reserved, and you mustn't sit
alone, so Laurie will give you his (<font color='blue'><b>Laurie</b></font>) place, and that will spoil our
pleasure. Or he (<font color='blue'><b>Laurie</b></font>)'ll get another seat for you, and that isn't proper
when you weren't asked. You shan't stir a step, so you may just stay
where you are,''  (<font color='red'><b>Jo/Miss Jo/JO</b></font>)</div>scolded Jo, crosser than ever, having just pricked her (<font color='blue'><b>Jo</b></font>)
finger in her (<font color='blue'><b>Jo</b></font>) hurry.

<p/>Sitting on the floor with one boot on, Amy began to cry and Meg to
reason with her (<font color='blue'><b>Meg</b></font>), when Laurie called from below, and the two girls
hurried down, leaving their sister wailing. For now and then she (<font color='blue'><b>sister</b></font>)
forgot her (<font color='blue'><b>sister</b></font>) grown-up ways and acted like a spoiled child. Just as the
party was setting out, Amy called over the banisters in a threatening
tone, <div class="bookquote">``You'll be sorry for this, Jo March, see if you ain't.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Amy/Amy March</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Fiddlesticks!''  (<font color='red'><b>Jo/Miss Jo/JO</b></font>)</div>returned Jo, slamming the door.

<p/>They had a charming time, for _The Seven Castles Of The Diamond Lake_
was as brilliant and wonderful as heart could wish. But in spite of the
comical red imps, sparkling elves, and the gorgeous princes and
princesses, Jo's pleasure had a drop of bitterness in it. The fairy
queen's yellow curls reminded her (<font color='blue'><b>fairy</b></font>) of Amy, and between the acts she (<font color='blue'><b>Amy</b></font>)
amused herself with wondering what her (<font color='blue'><b>Amy</b></font>) sister would do to make her (<font color='blue'><b>Amy</b></font>)
`sorry for it'. She (<font color='blue'><b>Amy</b></font>) and Amy had had many lively skirmishes in the
course of their lives, for both had quick tempers and were apt to be
violent when fairly roused. Amy teased Jo, and Jo irritated Amy, and
semioccasional explosions occurred, of which both were much ashamed
afterward. Although the oldest, Jo had the least self-control, and had
hard times trying to curb the fiery spirit which was continually
getting her (<font color='blue'><b>Jo</b></font>) into trouble. Her (<font color='blue'><b>Jo</b></font>) anger never lasted long, and having
humbly confessed her (<font color='blue'><b>Jo</b></font>) fault, she (<font color='blue'><b>Jo</b></font>) sincerely repented and tried to do
better. Her (<font color='blue'><b>Jo</b></font>) sisters used to say that they rather liked to get Jo into a
fury because she (<font color='blue'><b>Jo</b></font>) was such an angel afterward. Poor Jo tried
desperately to be good, but her (<font color='blue'><b>Jo</b></font>) bosom enemy was always ready to flame
up and defeat her (<font color='blue'><b>Jo</b></font>), and it took years of patient effort to subdue it.

<p/>When they got home, they found Amy reading in the parlor. She (<font color='blue'><b>Amy</b></font>) assumed
an injured air as they came in, never lifted her (<font color='blue'><b>Amy</b></font>) eyes from her (<font color='blue'><b>Amy</b></font>) book, or
asked a single question. Perhaps curiosity might have conquered
resentment, if Beth had not been there to inquire and receive a glowing
description of the play. On going up to put away her (<font color='blue'><b>Beth</b></font>) best hat, Jo's
first look was toward the bureau, for in their last quarrel Amy had
soothed her (<font color='blue'><b>Amy</b></font>) feelings by turning Jo's top drawer upside down on the
floor. Everything was in its place, however, and after a hasty glance
into her (<font color='blue'><b>Jo</b></font>) various closets, bags, and boxes, Jo decided that Amy had
forgiven and forgotten her (<font color='blue'><b>Jo</b></font>) wrongs.

<p/>There Jo was mistaken, for next day she (<font color='blue'><b>Jo</b></font>) made a discovery which produced
a tempest. Meg, Beth, and Amy were sitting together, late in the
afternoon, when Jo burst into the room, looking excited and demanding
breathlessly, <div class="bookquote">``Has anyone taken my book?''

 (<font color='red'><b>Jo/Miss Jo/JO</b></font>)</div><p/>Meg and Beth said, <div class="bookquote">``No.''  (<font color='red'><b>Beth</b></font>)</div>at once, and looked surprised. Amy poked the
fire and said nothing. Jo saw her (<font color='blue'><b>Jo</b></font>) color rise and was down upon her (<font color='blue'><b>Jo</b></font>) in
a minute.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Amy, you've got it!''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``No, I haven't.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``You know where it is, then!''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``No, I don't.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``That's a fib!''  (<font color='red'><b>Jo/Miss Jo/JO</b></font>)</div>cried Jo, taking her (<font color='blue'><b>Jo</b></font>) by the shoulders, and looking
fierce enough to frighten a much braver child than Amy.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``It isn't. I haven't got it, don't know where it is now, and don't
care.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``You know something about it, and you'd better tell at once, or I'll
make you.''  (<font color='red'><b>Jo/Miss Jo/JO</b></font>)</div>And Jo gave her (<font color='blue'><b>Jo</b></font>) a slight shake.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Scold as much as you like, you'll never see your silly old book
again,''  (<font color='red'><b>Amy/Amy March</b></font>)</div>cried Amy, getting excited in her (<font color='blue'><b>Jo</b></font>) turn.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Why not?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I burned it up.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``What! My little book I was so fond of, and worked over, and meant to
finish before Father got home? Have you really burned it?''  (<font color='red'><b>Jo/Miss Jo/JO</b></font>)</div>said Jo,
turning very pale, while her (<font color='blue'><b>Jo</b></font>) eyes kindled and her (<font color='blue'><b>Jo</b></font>) hands clutched Amy
nervously.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Yes, I did! I told you I'd make you pay for being so cross yesterday,
and I have, so...''

 (<font color='red'><b>Amy/Amy March</b></font>)</div><p/>Amy got no farther, for Jo's hot temper mastered her (<font color='blue'><b>Amy</b></font>), and she (<font color='blue'><b>Amy</b></font>) shook Amy
till her (<font color='blue'><b>Amy</b></font>) teeth chattered in her (<font color='blue'><b>Amy</b></font>) head, crying in a passion of grief and
anger...

<p/><div class="bookquote">``You wicked, wicked girl! I never can write it again, and I'll never
forgive you as long as I live.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Amy/Amy March</b></font>)</div><p/>Meg flew to rescue Amy, and Beth to pacify Jo, but Jo was quite beside
herself, and with a parting box on her (<font color='blue'><b>Jo</b></font>) sister's ear, she (<font color='blue'><b>Jo</b></font>) rushed out of
the room up to the old sofa in the garret, and finished her (<font color='blue'><b>Jo</b></font>) fight alone.

<p/>The storm cleared up below, for Mrs. March came home, and, having heard
the story, soon brought Amy to a sense of the wrong she (<font color='blue'><b>Amy</b></font>) had done her (<font color='blue'><b>Amy</b></font>)
sister. Jo's book was the pride of her (<font color='blue'><b>Jo</b></font>) heart, and was regarded by her (<font color='blue'><b>Jo</b></font>)
family as a literary sprout of great promise. It was only half a dozen
little fairy tales, but Jo had worked over them patiently, putting her (<font color='blue'><b>Jo</b></font>)
whole heart into her (<font color='blue'><b>Jo</b></font>) work, hoping to make something good enough to
print. She (<font color='blue'><b>Jo</b></font>) had just copied them with great care, and had destroyed the
old manuscript, so that Amy's bonfire had consumed the loving work of
several years. It seemed a small loss to others, but to Jo it was a
dreadful calamity, and she (<font color='blue'><b>Jo</b></font>) felt that it never could be made up to her (<font color='blue'><b>Jo</b></font>).
Beth mourned as for a departed kitten, and Meg refused to defend her (<font color='blue'><b>Meg</b></font>)
pet. Mrs. March looked grave and grieved, and Amy felt that no one
would love her (<font color='blue'><b>Amy</b></font>) till she (<font color='blue'><b>Amy</b></font>) had asked pardon for the act which she (<font color='blue'><b>Amy</b></font>) now
regretted more than any of them.

<p/>When the tea bell rang, Jo appeared, looking so grim and unapproachable
that it took all Amy's courage to say meekly...

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Please forgive me, Jo. I'm very, very sorry.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Amy/Amy March</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I never shall forgive you,''  (<font color='red'><b>Jo/Miss Jo/JO</b></font>)</div>was Jo's stern answer, and from that
moment she (<font color='blue'><b>Jo</b></font>) ignored Amy entirely.

<p/>No one spoke of the great trouble, not even Mrs. March, for all had
learned by experience that when Jo was in that mood words were wasted,
and the wisest course was to wait till some little accident, or her (<font color='blue'><b>Jo</b></font>) own
generous nature, softened Jo's resentment and healed the breach. It
was not a happy evening, for though they sewed as usual, while their
mother read aloud from Bremer, Scott, or Edgeworth, something was
wanting, and the sweet home peace was disturbed. They felt this most
when singing time came, for Beth could only play, Jo stood dumb as a
stone, and Amy broke down, so Meg and Mother sang alone. But in spite
of their efforts to be as cheery as larks, the flutelike voices did not
seem to chord as well as usual, and all felt out of tune.

<p/>As Jo received her (<font color='blue'><b>Jo</b></font>) good-night kiss, Mrs. March whispered gently, <div class="bookquote">``My
dear, don't let the sun go down upon your anger. Forgive each other,
help each other, and begin again tomorrow.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Jo/Miss Jo/JO</b></font>)</div><p/>Jo wanted to lay her (<font color='blue'><b>Jo</b></font>) head down on that motherly bosom, and cry her (<font color='blue'><b>Jo</b></font>)
grief and anger all away, but tears were an unmanly weakness, and she (<font color='blue'><b>Jo</b></font>)
felt so deeply injured that she (<font color='blue'><b>Jo</b></font>) really couldn't quite forgive yet. So
she (<font color='blue'><b>Jo</b></font>) winked hard, shook her (<font color='blue'><b>Jo</b></font>) head, and said gruffly because Amy was
listening, <div class="bookquote">``It was an abominable thing, and she (<font color='blue'><b>Jo</b></font>) doesn't deserve to be
forgiven.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Amy/Amy March</b></font>)</div><p/>With that she (<font color='blue'><b>Amy</b></font>) marched off to bed, and there was no merry or
confidential gossip that night.

<p/>Amy was much offended that her (<font color='blue'><b>Amy</b></font>) overtures of peace had been repulsed,
and began to wish she (<font color='blue'><b>Amy</b></font>) had not humbled herself, to feel more injured
than ever, and to plume herself on her (<font color='blue'><b>Amy</b></font>) superior virtue in a way which
was particularly exasperating. Jo still looked like a thunder cloud,
and nothing went well all day. It was bitter cold in the morning, she (<font color='blue'><b>Jo</b></font>)
dropped her (<font color='blue'><b>Jo</b></font>) precious turnover in the gutter, Aunt March had an attack
of the fidgets, Meg was sensitive, Beth would look grieved and wistful
when she (<font color='blue'><b>Beth</b></font>) got home, and Amy kept making remarks about people who were
always talking about being good and yet wouldn't even try when other
people set them a virtuous example.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Everybody is so hateful, I'll ask Laurie to go skating. He (<font color='blue'><b>Laurie</b></font>) is always
kind and jolly, and will put me to rights, I know,''  (<font color='red'><b>Jo/Miss Jo/JO</b></font>)</div>said Jo to herself,
and off she (<font color='blue'><b>Jo</b></font>) went.

<p/>Amy heard the clash of skates, and looked out with an impatient
exclamation.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``There! She (<font color='blue'><b>Jo</b></font>) promised I should go next time, for this is the last ice
we shall have. But it's no use to ask such a crosspatch to take me.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Don't say that. You were very naughty, and it is hard to forgive the
loss of her (<font color='blue'><b>Jo</b></font>) precious little book, but I think she (<font color='blue'><b>Jo</b></font>) might do it now, and
I guess she (<font color='blue'><b>Jo</b></font>) will, if you try her (<font color='blue'><b>Jo</b></font>) at the right minute,''  (<font color='red'><b>Meg</b></font>)</div>said Meg. <div class="bookquote">``Go
after them. Don't say anything till Jo has got good-natured with
Laurie, than take a quiet minute and just kiss her (<font color='blue'><b>Jo</b></font>), or do some kind
thing, and I'm sure she (<font color='blue'><b>Jo</b></font>)'ll be friends again with all her (<font color='blue'><b>Jo</b></font>) heart.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I'll try,''  (<font color='red'><b>Amy/Amy March</b></font>)</div>said Amy, for the advice suited her (<font color='blue'><b>Amy</b></font>), and after a flurry to
get ready, she (<font color='blue'><b>Amy</b></font>) ran after the friends, who were just disappearing over
the hill.

<p/>It was not far to the river, but both were ready before Amy reached
them. Jo saw her (<font color='blue'><b>Jo</b></font>) coming, and turned her (<font color='blue'><b>Jo</b></font>) back. Laurie did not see, for
he (<font color='blue'><b>Laurie</b></font>) was carefully skating along the shore, sounding the ice, for a warm
spell had preceded the cold snap.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``I'll go on to the first bend, and see if it's all right before we
begin to race,''  (<font color='red'><b>Amy/Amy March</b></font>)</div>Amy heard him (<font color='blue'><b>Laurie</b></font>) say, as he (<font color='blue'><b>Laurie</b></font>) shot away, looking like a
young Russian in his (<font color='blue'><b>Laurie</b></font>) fur-trimmed coat and cap.

<p/>Jo heard Amy panting after her (<font color='blue'><b>Amy</b></font>) run, stamping her (<font color='blue'><b>Amy</b></font>) feet and blowing on
her (<font color='blue'><b>Amy</b></font>) fingers as she (<font color='blue'><b>Amy</b></font>) tried to put her (<font color='blue'><b>Amy</b></font>) skates on, but Jo never turned and
went slowly zigzagging down the river, taking a bitter, unhappy sort of
satisfaction in her (<font color='blue'><b>Jo</b></font>) sister's troubles. She (<font color='blue'><b>Jo</b></font>) had cherished her (<font color='blue'><b>Jo</b></font>) anger till
it grew strong and took possession of her (<font color='blue'><b>Jo</b></font>), as evil thoughts and
feelings always do unless cast out at once. As Laurie turned the bend,
he (<font color='blue'><b>Laurie</b></font>) shouted back...

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Keep near the shore. It isn't safe in the middle.''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>Jo heard, but Amy
was struggling to her (<font color='blue'><b>Amy</b></font>) feet and did not catch a word. Jo glanced over
her (<font color='blue'><b>Jo</b></font>) shoulder, and the little demon she (<font color='blue'><b>Jo</b></font>) was harboring said in her (<font color='blue'><b>Jo</b></font>) ear...

<p/><div class="bookquote">``No matter whether she (<font color='blue'><b>Jo</b></font>) heard or not, let her (<font color='blue'><b>Jo</b></font>) take care of herself.''

 (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div><p/>Laurie had vanished round the bend, Jo was just at the turn, and Amy,
far behind, striking out toward the smoother ice in the middle of the
river. For a minute Jo stood still with a strange feeling in her (<font color='blue'><b>Jo</b></font>)
heart, then she (<font color='blue'><b>Jo</b></font>) resolved to go on, but something held and turned her (<font color='blue'><b>Jo</b></font>)
round, just in time to see Amy throw up her (<font color='blue'><b>Amy</b></font>) hands and go down, with a
sudden crash of rotten ice, the splash of water, and a cry that made
Jo's heart stand still with fear. She (<font color='blue'><b>Jo</b></font>) tried to call Laurie, but her (<font color='blue'><b>Jo</b></font>)
voice was gone. She (<font color='blue'><b>Jo</b></font>) tried to rush forward, but her (<font color='blue'><b>Jo</b></font>) feet seemed to have
no strength in them, and for a second, she (<font color='blue'><b>Jo</b></font>) could only stand motionless,
staring with a terror-stricken face at the little blue hood above the
black water. Something rushed swiftly by her (<font color='blue'><b>Jo</b></font>), and Laurie's voice cried
out...

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Bring a rail. Quick, quick!''

 (<font color='red'><b>Laurie/Mr. Laurie/LAURIE</b></font>)</div><p/>How she (<font color='blue'><b>Jo</b></font>) did it, she (<font color='blue'><b>Jo</b></font>) never knew, but for the next few minutes she (<font color='blue'><b>Jo</b></font>) worked
as if possessed, blindly obeying Laurie, who was quite self-possessed,
and lying flat, held Amy up by his (<font color='blue'><b>Laurie</b></font>) arm and hockey stick till Jo dragged
a rail from the fence, and together they got the child out, more
frightened than hurt.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Now then, we must walk her (<font color='blue'><b>Jo</b></font>) home as fast as we can. Pile our things on
her (<font color='blue'><b>Jo</b></font>), while I get off these confounded skates,''  (<font color='red'><b>Laurie/Mr. Laurie/LAURIE</b></font>)</div>cried Laurie, wrapping
his (<font color='blue'><b>Laurie</b></font>) coat round Amy, and tugging away at the straps which never seemed
so intricate before.

<p/>Shivering, dripping, and crying, they got Amy home, and after an
exciting time of it, she (<font color='blue'><b>Amy</b></font>) fell asleep, rolled in blankets before a hot
fire. During the bustle Jo had scarcely spoken but flown about,
looking pale and wild, with her (<font color='blue'><b>Jo</b></font>) things half off, her (<font color='blue'><b>Jo</b></font>) dress torn, and
her (<font color='blue'><b>Jo</b></font>) hands cut and bruised by ice and rails and refractory buckles. When
Amy was comfortably asleep, the house quiet, and Mrs. March sitting by
the bed, she (<font color='blue'><b>Amy</b></font>) called Jo to her (<font color='blue'><b>Jo</b></font>) and began to bind up the hurt hands.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Are you sure she (<font color='blue'><b>Jo</b></font>) is safe?''  (<font color='red'><b>Jo/Miss Jo/JO</b></font>)</div>whispered Jo, looking remorsefully at the
golden head, which might have been swept away from her (<font color='blue'><b>Jo</b></font>) sight forever
under the treacherous ice.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Quite safe, dear. She (<font color='blue'><b>Jo</b></font>) is not hurt, and won't even take cold, I think,
you were so sensible in covering and getting her (<font color='blue'><b>Jo</b></font>) home quickly,''  (<font color='red'><b>mother</b></font>)</div>replied
her (<font color='blue'><b>Jo</b></font>) mother cheerfully.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Laurie did it all. I only let her (<font color='blue'><b>Jo</b></font>) go. Mother, if she (<font color='blue'><b>Jo</b></font>) should die, it
would be my fault.''  (<font color='red'><b>Jo/Miss Jo/JO</b></font>)</div>And Jo dropped down beside the bed in a passion of
penitent tears, telling all that had happened, bitterly condemning her (<font color='blue'><b>Jo</b></font>)
hardness of heart, and sobbing out her (<font color='blue'><b>Jo</b></font>) gratitude for being spared the
heavy punishment which might have come upon her (<font color='blue'><b>Jo</b></font>).

<p/><div class="bookquote">``It's my dreadful temper! I try to cure it, I think I have, and then
it breaks out worse than ever. Oh, Mother, what shall I do? What
shall I do?''  (<font color='red'><b>Jo/Miss Jo/JO</b></font>)</div>cried poor Jo, in despair.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Watch and pray, dear, never get tired of trying, and never think it is
impossible to conquer your fault,''  (<font color='red'><b>Jo/Miss Jo/JO</b></font>)</div>said Mrs. March, drawing the blowzy
head to her (<font color='blue'><b>Jo</b></font>) shoulder and kissing the wet cheek so tenderly that Jo
cried even harder.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``You don't know, you can't guess how bad it is! It seems as if I could
do anything when I'm in a passion. I get so savage, I could hurt
anyone and enjoy it. I'm afraid I shall do something dreadful some
day, and spoil my life, and make everybody hate me. Oh, Mother, help
me, do help me!''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I will, my child, I will. Don't cry so bitterly, but remember this
day, and resolve with all your soul that you will never know another
like it. Jo, dear, we all have our temptations, some far greater than
yours, and it often takes us all our lives to conquer them. You think
your temper is the worst in the world, but mine used to be just like
it.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Yours, Mother? Why, you are never angry!''  (<font color='red'><b>Jo/Miss Jo/JO</b></font>)</div>And for the moment Jo
forgot remorse in surprise.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``I've been trying to cure it for forty years, and have only succeeded
in controlling it. I am angry nearly every day of my life, Jo, but I
have learned not to show it, and I still hope to learn not to feel it,
though it may take me another forty years to do so.''

 (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div><p/>The patience and the humility of the face she (<font color='blue'><b>Jo</b></font>) loved so well was a
better lesson to Jo than the wisest lecture, the sharpest reproof. She (<font color='blue'><b>Jo</b></font>)
felt comforted at once by the sympathy and confidence given her (<font color='blue'><b>Jo</b></font>). The
knowledge that her (<font color='blue'><b>Jo</b></font>) mother had a fault like hers, and tried to mend it,
made her (<font color='blue'><b>Jo</b></font>) own easier to bear and strengthened her (<font color='blue'><b>Jo</b></font>) resolution to cure it,
though forty years seemed rather a long time to watch and pray to a
girl of fifteen.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Mother, are you angry when you fold your lips tight together and go
out of the room sometimes, when Aunt March scolds or people worry you?''
 (<font color='red'><b>Jo/Miss Jo/JO</b></font>)</div>asked Jo, feeling nearer and dearer to her (<font color='blue'><b>Jo</b></font>) mother than ever before.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Yes, I've learned to check the hasty words that rise to my lips, and
when I feel that they mean to break out against my will, I just go away
for a minute, and give myself a little shake for being so weak and
wicked,''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>answered Mrs. March with a sigh and a smile, as she (<font color='blue'><b>Jo</b></font>) smoothed
and fastened up Jo's disheveled hair.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``How did you learn to keep still? That is what troubles me, for the
sharp words fly out before I know what I'm about, and the more I say
the worse I get, till it's a pleasure to hurt people's feelings and say
dreadful things. Tell me how you do it, Marmee dear.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``My good mother used to help me...''

 (<font color='red'><b>Jo/Miss Jo/JO</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``As you do us...''  (<font color='red'><b>Jo/Miss Jo/JO</b></font>)</div>interrupted Jo, with a grateful kiss.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``But I lost her (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) when I was a little older than you are, and for years
had to struggle on alone, for I was too proud to confess my weakness to
anyone else. I had a hard time, Jo, and shed a good many bitter tears
over my failures, for in spite of my efforts I never seemed to get on.
Then your father came, and I was so happy that I found it easy to be
good. But by-and-by, when I had four little daughters round me and we
were poor, then the old trouble began again, for I am not patient by
nature, and it tried me very much to see my children wanting anything.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Poor Mother! What helped you then?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Your father, Jo. He (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) never loses patience, never doubts or complains,
but always hopes, and works and waits so cheerfully that one is ashamed
to do otherwise before him (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>). He (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) helped and comforted me, and showed me
that I must try to practice all the virtues I would have my little
girls possess, for I was their example. It was easier to try for your
sakes than for my own. A startled or surprised look from one of you
when I spoke sharply rebuked me more than any words could have done,
and the love, respect, and confidence of my children was the sweetest
reward I could receive for my efforts to be the woman I would have them
copy.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Oh, Mother, if I'm ever half as good as you, I shall be satisfied,''
 (<font color='red'><b>Jo/Miss Jo/JO</b></font>)</div>cried Jo, much touched.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``I hope you will be a great deal better, dear, but you must keep watch
over your `bosom enemy', as father calls it, or it may sadden, if not
spoil your life. You have had a warning. Remember it, and try with
heart and soul to master this quick temper, before it brings you
greater sorrow and regret than you have known today.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I will try, Mother, I truly will. But you must help me, remind me,
and keep me from flying out. I used to see Father sometimes put his (<font color='blue'><b>Father</b></font>)
finger on his (<font color='blue'><b>Father</b></font>) lips, and look at you with a very kind but sober face,
and you always folded your lips tight and went away. Was he (<font color='blue'><b>Father</b></font>) reminding
you then?''  (<font color='red'><b>Jo/Miss Jo/JO</b></font>)</div>asked Jo softly.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Yes. I asked him (<font color='blue'><b>Father</b></font>) to help me so, and he (<font color='blue'><b>Father</b></font>) never forgot it, but saved me
from many a sharp word by that little gesture and kind look.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Jo/Miss Jo/JO</b></font>)</div><p/>Jo saw that her (<font color='blue'><b>Jo</b></font>) mother's eyes filled and her (<font color='blue'><b>Jo</b></font>) lips trembled as she (<font color='blue'><b>Jo</b></font>)
spoke, and fearing that she (<font color='blue'><b>Jo</b></font>) had said too much, she (<font color='blue'><b>Jo</b></font>) whispered anxiously,
<div class="bookquote">``Was it wrong to watch you and to speak of it? I didn't mean to be
rude, but it's so comfortable to say all I think to you, and feel so
safe and happy here.''

 (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``My Jo, you may say anything to your mother, for it is my greatest
happiness and pride to feel that my girls confide in me and know how
much I love them.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I thought I'd grieved you.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``No, dear, but speaking of Father reminded me how much I miss him (<font color='blue'><b>Father</b></font>), how
much I owe him (<font color='blue'><b>Father</b></font>), and how faithfully I should watch and work to keep his (<font color='blue'><b>Father</b></font>)
little daughters safe and good for him (<font color='blue'><b>Father</b></font>).''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Yet you told him (<font color='blue'><b>Father</b></font>) to go, Mother, and didn't cry when he (<font color='blue'><b>Father</b></font>) went, and never
complain now, or seem as if you needed any help,''  (<font color='red'><b>Jo/Miss Jo/JO</b></font>)</div>said Jo, wondering.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``I gave my best to the country I love, and kept my tears till he (<font color='blue'><b>Father</b></font>) was
gone. Why should I complain, when we both have merely done our duty
and will surely be the happier for it in the end? If I don't seem to
need help, it is because I have a better friend, even than Father, to
comfort and sustain me. My child, the troubles and temptations of your
life are beginning and may be many, but you can overcome and outlive
them all if you learn to feel the strength and tenderness of your
Heavenly Father as you do that of your earthly one. The more you love
and trust Him (<font color='blue'><b>Father</b></font>), the nearer you will feel to Him (<font color='blue'><b>Father</b></font>), and the less you will
depend on human power and wisdom. His (<font color='blue'><b>Father</b></font>) love and care never tire or
change, can never be taken from you, but may become the source of
lifelong peace, happiness, and strength. Believe this heartily, and go
to God with all your little cares, and hopes, and sins, and sorrows, as
freely and confidingly as you come to your mother.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Jo/Miss Jo/JO</b></font>)</div><p/>Jo's only answer was to hold her (<font color='blue'><b>Jo</b></font>) mother close, and in the silence which
followed the sincerest prayer she (<font color='blue'><b>Jo</b></font>) had ever prayed left her (<font color='blue'><b>Jo</b></font>) heart
without words. For in that sad yet happy hour, she (<font color='blue'><b>Jo</b></font>) had learned not
only the bitterness of remorse and despair, but the sweetness of
self-denial and self-control, and led by her (<font color='blue'><b>Jo</b></font>) mother's hand, she (<font color='blue'><b>Jo</b></font>) had
drawn nearer to the Friend who always welcomes every child with a love
stronger than that of any father, tenderer than that of any mother.

<p/>Amy stirred and sighed in her (<font color='blue'><b>Amy</b></font>) sleep, and as if eager to begin at once
to mend her (<font color='blue'><b>Amy</b></font>) fault, Jo looked up with an expression on her (<font color='blue'><b>Jo</b></font>) face which it
had never worn before.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``I let the sun go down on my anger. I wouldn't forgive her (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>), and today,
if it hadn't been for Laurie, it might have been too late! How could I
be so wicked?''  (<font color='red'><b>Jo/Miss Jo/JO</b></font>)</div>said Jo, half aloud, as she (<font color='blue'><b>Jo</b></font>) leaned over her (<font color='blue'><b>Jo</b></font>) sister
softly stroking the wet hair scattered on the pillow.

<p/>As if she (<font color='blue'><b>Jo</b></font>) heard, Amy opened her (<font color='blue'><b>Amy</b></font>) eyes, and held out her (<font color='blue'><b>Amy</b></font>) arms, with a
smile that went straight to Jo's heart. Neither said a word, but they
hugged one another close, in spite of the blankets, and everything was
forgiven and forgotten in one hearty kiss.



<p/>CHAPTER NINE

<p/>MEG GOES TO VANITY FAIR

<p/><div class="bookquote">``I do think it was the most fortunate thing in the world that those
children should have the measles just now,''  (<font color='red'><b>Meg</b></font>)</div>said Meg, one April day, as
she (<font color='blue'><b>Meg</b></font>) stood packing the `go abroady' trunk in her (<font color='blue'><b>Meg</b></font>) room, surrounded by her (<font color='blue'><b>Meg</b></font>)
sisters.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``And so nice of Annie Moffat not to forget her (<font color='blue'><b>Moffat</b></font>) promise. A whole
fortnight of fun will be regularly splendid,''  (<font color='red'><b>Jo/Miss Jo/JO</b></font>)</div>replied Jo, looking like
a windmill as she (<font color='blue'><b>Jo</b></font>) folded skirts with her (<font color='blue'><b>Jo</b></font>) long arms.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``And such lovely weather, I'm so glad of that,''  (<font color='red'><b>Beth</b></font>)</div>added Beth, tidily
sorting neck and hair ribbons in her (<font color='blue'><b>Jo</b></font>) best box, lent for the great
occasion.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``I wish I was going to have a fine time and wear all these nice
things,''  (<font color='red'><b>Amy/Amy March</b></font>)</div>said Amy with her (<font color='blue'><b>Amy</b></font>) mouth full of pins, as she (<font color='blue'><b>Amy</b></font>) artistically
replenished her (<font color='blue'><b>Amy</b></font>) sister's cushion.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``I wish you were all going, but as you can't, I shall keep my
adventures to tell you when I come back. I'm sure it's the least I can
do when you have been so kind, lending me things and helping me get
ready,''  (<font color='red'><b>Meg</b></font>)</div>said Meg, glancing round the room at the very simple outfit,
which seemed nearly perfect in their eyes.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``What did Mother give you out of the treasure box?''  (<font color='red'><b>Amy/Amy March</b></font>)</div>asked Amy, who had
not been present at the opening of a certain cedar chest in which Mrs.
March kept a few relics of past splendor, as gifts for her (<font color='blue'><b>Amy</b></font>) girls when
the proper time came.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``A pair of silk stockings, that pretty carved fan, and a lovely blue
sash. I wanted the violet silk, but there isn't time to make it over,
so I must be contented with my old tarlaton.''


 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``It will look nice over my new muslin skirt, and the sash will set it
off beautifully. I wish I hadn't smashed my coral bracelet, for you
might have had it,''  (<font color='red'><b>Jo/Miss Jo/JO</b></font>)</div>said Jo, who loved to give and lend, but whose
possessions were usually too dilapidated to be of much use.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``There is a lovely old-fashioned pearl set in the treasure chest, but
Mother said real flowers were the prettiest ornament for a young girl,
and Laurie promised to send me all I want,''  (<font color='red'><b>Meg</b></font>)</div>replied Meg. <div class="bookquote">``Now, let me
see, there's my new gray walking suit, just curl up the feather in my
hat, Beth, then my poplin for Sunday and the small party, it looks
heavy for spring, doesn't it? The violet silk would be so nice. Oh,
dear!''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Never mind, you've got the tarlaton for the big party, and you always
look like an angel in white,''  (<font color='red'><b>Amy/Amy March</b></font>)</div>said Amy, brooding over the little store
of finery in which her (<font color='blue'><b>Amy</b></font>) soul delighted.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``It isn't low-necked, and it doesn't sweep enough, but it will have to
do. My blue housedress looks so well, turned and freshly trimmed, that
I feel as if I'd got a new one. My silk sacque isn't a bit the
fashion, and my bonnet doesn't look like Sallie's. I didn't like to
say anything, but I was sadly disappointed in my umbrella. I told
Mother black with a white handle, but she (<font color='blue'><b>Mother</b></font>) forgot and bought a green one
with a yellowish handle. It's strong and neat, so I ought not to
complain, but I know I shall feel ashamed of it beside Annie's silk one
with a gold top,''  (<font color='red'><b>Meg</b></font>)</div>sighed Meg, surveying the little umbrella with great
disfavor.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Change it,''  (<font color='red'><b>Jo/Miss Jo/JO</b></font>)</div>advised Jo.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``I won't be so silly, or hurt Marmee's feelings, when she (<font color='blue'><b>Annie</b></font>) took so much
pains to get my things. It's a nonsensical notion of mine, and I'm not
going to give up to it. My silk stockings and two pairs of new gloves
are my comfort. You are a dear to lend me yours, Jo. I feel so rich
and sort of elegant, with two new pairs, and the old ones cleaned up
for common.''  (<font color='red'><b>Meg</b></font>)</div>And Meg took a refreshing peep at her (<font color='blue'><b>Meg</b></font>) glove box.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Annie Moffat has blue and pink bows on her (<font color='blue'><b>Moffat</b></font>) nightcaps. Would you put
some on mine?''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Meg</b></font>) asked, as Beth brought up a pile of snowy muslins,
fresh from Hannah's hands.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``No, I wouldn't, for the smart caps won't match the plain gowns without
any trimming on them. Poor folks shouldn't rig,''  (<font color='red'><b>Jo/Miss Jo/JO</b></font>)</div>said Jo decidedly.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``I wonder if I shall ever be happy enough to have real lace on my
clothes and bows on my caps?''  (<font color='red'><b>Meg</b></font>)</div>said Meg impatiently.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``You said the other day that you'd be perfectly happy if you could only
go to Annie Moffat's,''  (<font color='red'><b>Beth</b></font>)</div>observed Beth in her (<font color='blue'><b>Jo</b></font>) quiet way.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``So I did! Well, I am happy, and I won't fret, but it does seem as if
the more one gets the more one wants, doesn't it? There now, the trays
are ready, and everything in but my ball dress, which I shall leave for
Mother to pack,''  (<font color='red'><b>Meg</b></font>)</div>said Meg, cheering up, as she (<font color='blue'><b>Meg</b></font>) glanced from the
half-filled trunk to the many times pressed and mended white tarlaton,
which she (<font color='blue'><b>Meg</b></font>) called her (<font color='blue'><b>Meg</b></font>) `ball dress' with an important air.

<p/>The next day was fine, and Meg departed in style for a fortnight of
novelty and pleasure. Mrs. March had consented to the visit rather
reluctantly, fearing that Margaret would come back more discontented
than she (<font color='blue'><b>Margaret</b></font>) went. But she (<font color='blue'><b>Margaret</b></font>) begged so hard, and Sallie had promised to take
good care of her (<font color='blue'><b>Sallie</b></font>), and a little pleasure seemed so delightful after a
winter of irksome work that the mother yielded, and the daughter went
to take her (<font color='blue'><b>daughter</b></font>) first taste of fashionable life.

<p/>The Moffats were very fashionable, and simple Meg was rather daunted,
at first, by the splendor of the house and the elegance of its
occupants. But they were kindly people, in spite of the frivolous life
they led, and soon put their guest at her (<font color='blue'><b>Meg</b></font>) ease. Perhaps Meg felt,
without understanding why, that they were not particularly cultivated
or intelligent people, and that all their gilding could not quite
conceal the ordinary material of which they were made. It certainly
was agreeable to fare sumptuously, drive in a fine carriage, wear her (<font color='blue'><b>Meg</b></font>)
best frock every day, and do nothing but enjoy herself. It suited her (<font color='blue'><b>Meg</b></font>)
exactly, and soon she (<font color='blue'><b>Meg</b></font>) began to imitate the manners and conversation of
those about her (<font color='blue'><b>Meg</b></font>), to put on little airs and graces, use French phrases,
crimp her (<font color='blue'><b>Meg</b></font>) hair, take in her (<font color='blue'><b>Meg</b></font>) dresses, and talk about the fashions as
well as she (<font color='blue'><b>Meg</b></font>) could. The more she (<font color='blue'><b>Meg</b></font>) saw of Annie Moffat's pretty things,
the more she (<font color='blue'><b>Meg</b></font>) envied her (<font color='blue'><b>Meg</b></font>) and sighed to be rich. Home now looked bare
and dismal as she (<font color='blue'><b>Meg</b></font>) thought of it, work grew harder than ever, and she (<font color='blue'><b>Meg</b></font>)
felt that she (<font color='blue'><b>Meg</b></font>) was a very destitute and much-injured girl, in spite of
the new gloves and silk stockings.

<p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>Meg</b></font>) had not much time for repining, however, for the three young girls
were busily employed in `having a good time'. They shopped, walked,
rode, and called all day, went to theaters and operas or frolicked at
home in the evening, for Annie had many friends and knew how to
entertain them. Her (<font color='blue'><b>Annie</b></font>) older sisters were very fine young ladies, and one
was engaged, which was extremely interesting and romantic, Meg thought.
Mr. Moffat was a fat, jolly old gentleman, who knew her (<font color='blue'><b>Meg</b></font>) father, and
Mrs. Moffat, a fat, jolly old lady, who took as great a fancy to Meg as
her (<font color='blue'><b>Meg</b></font>) daughter had done. Everyone petted her (<font color='blue'><b>Meg</b></font>), and ``Daisey', as they
called her (<font color='blue'><b>Mother</b></font>), was in a fair way to have her (<font color='blue'><b>Mother</b></font>) head turned.

<p/>When the evening for the small party came, she (<font color='blue'><b>Mother</b></font>) found that the poplin
wouldn't do at all, for the other girls were putting on thin dresses
and making themselves very fine indeed. So out came the tarlatan,
looking older, limper, and shabbier than ever beside Sallie's crisp new
one. Meg saw the girls glance at it and then at one another, and her (<font color='blue'><b>Meg</b></font>)
cheeks began to burn, for with all her (<font color='blue'><b>Meg</b></font>) gentleness she (<font color='blue'><b>Meg</b></font>) was very proud.
No one said a word about it, but Sallie offered to dress her (<font color='blue'><b>Sallie</b></font>) hair, and
Annie to tie her (<font color='blue'><b>Annie</b></font>) sash, and Belle, the engaged sister, praised her (<font color='blue'><b>Belle</b></font>) white
arms. But in their kindness Meg saw only pity for her (<font color='blue'><b>Meg</b></font>) poverty, and her (<font color='blue'><b>Meg</b></font>)
heart felt very heavy as she (<font color='blue'><b>Meg</b></font>) stood by herself, while the others
laughed, chattered, and flew about like gauzy butterflies. The hard,
bitter feeling was getting pretty bad, when the maid brought in a box
of flowers. Before she (<font color='blue'><b>maid</b></font>) could speak, Annie had the cover off, and all
were exclaiming at the lovely roses, heath, and fern within.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``It's for Belle, of course, George always sends her (<font color='blue'><b>Belle</b></font>) some, but these are
altogether ravishing,''  (<font color='red'><b>Annie/Annie Moffat/Moffat</b></font>)</div>cried Annie, with a great sniff.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``They are for Miss March, the man said. And here's a note,''  (<font color='red'><b>the maid</b></font>)</div>put in the
maid, holding it to Meg.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``What fun! Who are they from? Didn't know you had a lover,''  (<font color='red'><b>the girls</b></font>)</div>cried the
girls, fluttering about Meg in a high state of curiosity and surprise.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``The note is from Mother, and the flowers from Laurie,''  (<font color='red'><b>Meg</b></font>)</div>said Meg
simply, yet much gratified that he (<font color='blue'><b>Moffat</b></font>) had not forgotten her (<font color='blue'><b>Meg</b></font>).

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Oh, indeed!''  (<font color='red'><b>Annie/Annie Moffat/Moffat</b></font>)</div>said Annie with a funny look, as Meg slipped the note
into her (<font color='blue'><b>Meg</b></font>) pocket as a sort of talisman against envy, vanity, and false
pride, for the few loving words had done her (<font color='blue'><b>Meg</b></font>) good, and the flowers
cheered her (<font color='blue'><b>Meg</b></font>) up by their beauty.

<p/>Feeling almost happy again, she (<font color='blue'><b>Meg</b></font>) laid by a few ferns and roses for
herself, and quickly made up the rest in dainty bouquets for the
breasts, hair, or skirts of her (<font color='blue'><b>Meg</b></font>) friends, offering them so prettily that
Clara, the elder sister, told her (<font color='blue'><b>Clara</b></font>) she (<font color='blue'><b>Clara</b></font>) was `the sweetest little thing
she (<font color='blue'><b>Clara</b></font>) ever saw', and they looked quite charmed with her (<font color='blue'><b>Clara</b></font>) small attention.
Somehow the kind act finished her (<font color='blue'><b>Clara</b></font>) despondency, and when all the rest
went to show themselves to Mrs. Moffat, she (<font color='blue'><b>Moffat</b></font>) saw a happy, bright-eyed
face in the mirror, as she (<font color='blue'><b>Moffat</b></font>) laid her (<font color='blue'><b>Moffat</b></font>) ferns against her (<font color='blue'><b>Moffat</b></font>) rippling hair and
fastened the roses in the dress that didn't strike her (<font color='blue'><b>Moffat</b></font>) as so very
shabby now.

<p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>Moffat</b></font>) enjoyed herself very much that evening, for she (<font color='blue'><b>Moffat</b></font>) danced to her (<font color='blue'><b>Moffat</b></font>)
heart's content. Everyone was very kind, and she (<font color='blue'><b>Moffat</b></font>) had three
compliments. Annie made her (<font color='blue'><b>Annie</b></font>) sing, and some one said she (<font color='blue'><b>Annie</b></font>) had a
remarkably fine voice. Major Lincoln asked who `the fresh little girl
with the beautiful eyes' was, and Mr. Moffat insisted on dancing with
her (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) because she (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) `didn't dawdle, but had some spring in her (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>)', as he (<font color='blue'><b>Moffat</b></font>)
gracefully expressed it. So altogether she (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) had a very nice time, till
she (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) overheard a bit of conversation, which disturbed her (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) extremely.
She (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) was sitting just inside the conservatory, waiting for her (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) partner
to bring her (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) an ice, when she (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) heard a voice ask on the other side of
the flowery wall...

<p/><div class="bookquote">``How old is he (<font color='blue'><b>Laurie</b></font>)?''

 (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Sixteen or seventeen, I should say,''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>replied another voice.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``It would be a grand thing for one of those girls, wouldn't it? Sallie
says they are very intimate now, and the old man quite dotes on them.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Mrs. M. has made her (<font color='blue'><b>M.</b></font>) plans, I dare say, and will play her (<font color='blue'><b>M.</b></font>) cards well,
early as it is. The girl evidently doesn't think of it yet,''  (<font color='red'><b>Mrs. Moffat</b></font>)</div>said Mrs.
Moffat.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``She (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) told that fib about her (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) momma, as if she (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) did know, and colored up
when the flowers came quite prettily. Poor thing! She (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>)'d be so nice if
she (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) was only got up in style. Do you think she (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>)'d be offended if we
offered to lend her (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) a dress for Thursday?''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>asked another voice.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``She (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>)'s proud, but I don't believe she (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>)'d mind, for that dowdy tarlaton
is all she (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) has got. She (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) may tear it tonight, and that will be a good
excuse for offering a decent one.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Meg</b></font>)</div><p/>Here Meg's partner appeared, to find her (<font color='blue'><b>Moffat</b></font>) looking much flushed and
rather agitated. She (<font color='blue'><b>Moffat</b></font>) was proud, and her (<font color='blue'><b>Moffat</b></font>) pride was useful just then,
for it helped her (<font color='blue'><b>Moffat</b></font>) hide her (<font color='blue'><b>Moffat</b></font>) mortification, anger, and disgust at what
she (<font color='blue'><b>Moffat</b></font>) had just heard. For, innocent and unsuspicious as she (<font color='blue'><b>Moffat</b></font>) was, she (<font color='blue'><b>Moffat</b></font>)
could not help understanding the gossip of her (<font color='blue'><b>Moffat</b></font>) friends. She (<font color='blue'><b>Moffat</b></font>) tried to
forget it, but could not, and kept repeating to herself, <div class="bookquote">``Mrs. M. has
made her (<font color='blue'><b>M.</b></font>) plans,''  (<font color='red'><b>She</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``that fib about her (<font color='blue'><b>M.</b></font>) mamma,''  (<font color='red'><b>She</b></font>)</div>and <div class="bookquote">``dowdy tarlaton,''  (<font color='red'><b>She</b></font>)</div>till
she (<font color='blue'><b>Moffat</b></font>) was ready to cry and rush home to tell her (<font color='blue'><b>Moffat</b></font>) troubles and ask for
advice. As that was impossible, she (<font color='blue'><b>Moffat</b></font>) did her (<font color='blue'><b>Moffat</b></font>) best to seem gay, and
being rather excited, she (<font color='blue'><b>Moffat</b></font>) succeeded so well that no one dreamed what an
effort she (<font color='blue'><b>Moffat</b></font>) was making. She (<font color='blue'><b>Moffat</b></font>) was very glad when it was all over and she (<font color='blue'><b>Moffat</b></font>)
was quiet in her (<font color='blue'><b>Moffat</b></font>) bed, where she (<font color='blue'><b>Moffat</b></font>) could think and wonder and fume till
her (<font color='blue'><b>Moffat</b></font>) head ached and her (<font color='blue'><b>Moffat</b></font>) hot cheeks were cooled by a few natural tears.
Those foolish, yet well meant words, had opened a new world to Meg, and
much disturbed the peace of the old one in which till now she (<font color='blue'><b>Meg</b></font>) had lived
as happily as a child. Her (<font color='blue'><b>Meg</b></font>) innocent friendship with Laurie was spoiled
by the silly speeches she (<font color='blue'><b>Meg</b></font>) had overheard. Her (<font color='blue'><b>Meg</b></font>) faith in her (<font color='blue'><b>Meg</b></font>) mother was a
little shaken by the worldly plans attributed to her (<font color='blue'><b>Meg</b></font>) by Mrs. Moffat,
who judged others by herself, and the sensible resolution to be
contented with the simple wardrobe which suited a poor man's daughter
was weakened by the unnecessary pity of girls who thought a shabby
dress one of the greatest calamities under heaven.

<p/>Poor Meg had a restless night, and got up heavy-eyed, unhappy, half
resentful toward her (<font color='blue'><b>Meg</b></font>) friends, and half ashamed of herself for not
speaking out frankly and setting everything right. Everybody dawdled
that morning, and it was noon before the girls found energy enough even
to take up their worsted work. Something in the manner of her (<font color='blue'><b>Meg</b></font>) friends
struck Meg at once. They treated her (<font color='blue'><b>Meg</b></font>) with more respect, she (<font color='blue'><b>Meg</b></font>) thought,
took quite a tender interest in what she (<font color='blue'><b>Meg</b></font>) said, and looked at her (<font color='blue'><b>Meg</b></font>) with
eyes that plainly betrayed curiosity. All this surprised and flattered
her (<font color='blue'><b>Meg</b></font>), though she (<font color='blue'><b>Meg</b></font>) did not understand it till Miss Belle looked up from
her (<font color='blue'><b>Belle</b></font>) writing, and said, with a sentimental air...

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Daisy, dear, I've sent an invitation to your friend, Mr. Laurence, for
Thursday. We should like to know him (<font color='blue'><b>Laurence</b></font>), and it's only a proper
compliment to you.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Miss Belle</b></font>)</div><p/>Meg colored, but a mischievous fancy to tease the girls made her (<font color='blue'><b>Meg</b></font>) reply
demurely, <div class="bookquote">``You are very kind, but I'm afraid he (<font color='blue'><b>Laurence</b></font>) won't come.''

 (<font color='red'><b>the girls</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Why not, Cherie?''  (<font color='red'><b>Belle/Miss Belle</b></font>)</div>asked Miss Belle.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``He (<font color='blue'><b>Laurence</b></font>)'s too old.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``My child, what do you mean? What is his (<font color='blue'><b>Laurence</b></font>) age, I beg to know!''  (<font color='red'><b>Miss Clara</b></font>)</div>cried
Miss Clara.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Nearly seventy, I believe,''  (<font color='red'><b>Meg</b></font>)</div>answered Meg, counting stitches to hide
the merriment in her (<font color='blue'><b>Meg</b></font>) eyes.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``You sly creature! Of course we meant the young man,''  (<font color='red'><b>Belle/Miss Belle</b></font>)</div>exclaimed Miss
Belle, laughing.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``There isn't any, Laurie is only a little boy.''  (<font color='red'><b>Meg</b></font>)</div>And Meg laughed also
at the queer look which the sisters exchanged as she (<font color='blue'><b>Meg</b></font>) thus described her (<font color='blue'><b>Meg</b></font>)
supposed lover.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``About your age,''  (<font color='red'><b>Nan</b></font>)</div>Nan said.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Nearer my sister Jo's; I am seventeen in August,''  (<font color='red'><b>Meg</b></font>)</div>returned Meg,
tossing her (<font color='blue'><b>Meg</b></font>) head.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``It's very nice of him (<font color='blue'><b>Laurie</b></font>) to send you flowers, isn't it?''  (<font color='red'><b>Annie/Annie Moffat/Moffat</b></font>)</div>said Annie,
looking wise about nothing.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Yes, he (<font color='blue'><b>Laurie</b></font>) often does, to all of us, for their house is full, and we are
so fond of them. My mother and old Mr. Laurence are friends, you know,
so it is quite natural that we children should play together,''  (<font color='red'><b>Meg</b></font>)</div>and Meg
hoped they would say no more.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``It's evident Daisy isn't out yet,''  (<font color='red'><b>Miss Clara</b></font>)</div>said Miss Clara to Belle with a nod.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Quite a pastoral state of innocence all round,''  (<font color='red'><b>Miss Belle</b></font>)</div>returned Miss Belle
with a shrug.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``I'm going out to get some little matters for my girls. Can I do
anything for you, young ladies?''  (<font color='red'><b>Mrs. Moffat</b></font>)</div>asked Mrs. Moffat, lumbering in like
an elephant in silk and lace.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``No, thank you, ma'am,''  (<font color='red'><b>Sallie/Miss Sallie</b></font>)</div>replied Sallie. <div class="bookquote">``I've got my new pink silk for
Thursday and don't want a thing.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Nor I...''  (<font color='red'><b>Meg</b></font>)</div>began Meg, but stopped because it occurred to her (<font color='blue'><b>Meg</b></font>) that she (<font color='blue'><b>Meg</b></font>)
did want several things and could not have them.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``What shall you wear?''  (<font color='red'><b>Sallie/Miss Sallie</b></font>)</div>asked Sallie.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``My old white one again, if I can mend it fit to be seen, it got sadly
torn last night,''  (<font color='red'><b>Meg</b></font>)</div>said Meg, trying to speak quite easily, but feeling
very uncomfortable.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Why don't you send home for another?''  (<font color='red'><b>Sallie/Miss Sallie</b></font>)</div>said Sallie, who was not an
observing young lady.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``I haven't got any other.''  (<font color='red'><b>Meg</b></font>)</div>It cost Meg an effort to say that, but
Sallie did not see it and exclaimed in amiable surprise, <div class="bookquote">``Only that?
How funny...''  (<font color='red'><b>Sallie/Miss Sallie</b></font>)</div>She (<font color='blue'><b>Sallie</b></font>) did not finish her (<font color='blue'><b>Sallie</b></font>) speech, for Belle shook her (<font color='blue'><b>Belle</b></font>) head
at her (<font color='blue'><b>Belle</b></font>) and broke in, saying kindly...

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Not at all. Where is the use of having a lot of dresses when she (<font color='blue'><b>I</b></font>)
isn't out yet? There's no need of sending home, Daisy, even if you had
a dozen, for I've got a sweet blue silk laid away, which I've outgrown,
and you shall wear it to please me, won't you, dear?''

 (<font color='red'><b>Belle/Miss Belle</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``You are very kind, but I don't mind my old dress if you don't, it does
well enough for a little girl like me,''  (<font color='red'><b>Meg</b></font>)</div>said Meg.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Now do let me please myself by dressing you up in style. I admire to
do it, and you'd be a regular little beauty with a touch here and
there. I shan't let anyone see you till you are done, and then we'll
burst upon them like Cinderella and her (<font color='blue'><b>Cinderella</b></font>) godmother going to the ball,''
 (<font color='red'><b>Belle/Miss Belle</b></font>)</div>said Belle in her (<font color='blue'><b>Belle</b></font>) persuasive tone.

<p/>Meg couldn't refuse the offer so kindly made, for a desire to see if
she (<font color='blue'><b>Meg</b></font>) would be 'a little beauty' after touching up caused her (<font color='blue'><b>Meg</b></font>) to accept
and forget all her (<font color='blue'><b>Meg</b></font>) former uncomfortable feelings toward the Moffats.

<p/>On the Thursday evening, Belle shut herself up with her (<font color='blue'><b>Belle</b></font>) maid, and
between them they turned Meg into a fine lady. They crimped and curled
her (<font color='blue'><b>Meg</b></font>) hair, they polished her (<font color='blue'><b>Meg</b></font>) neck and arms with some fragrant powder,
touched her (<font color='blue'><b>Meg</b></font>) lips with coralline salve to make them redder, and Hortense
would have added 'a soupcon of rouge', if Meg had not rebelled. They
laced her (<font color='blue'><b>Meg</b></font>) into a sky-blue dress, which was so tight she (<font color='blue'><b>Meg</b></font>) could hardly
breathe and so low in the neck that modest Meg blushed at herself in
the mirror. A set of silver filagree was added, bracelets, necklace,
brooch, and even earrings, for Hortense tied them on with a bit of pink
silk which did not show. A cluster of tea-rose buds at the bosom, and
a ruche, reconciled Meg to the display of her (<font color='blue'><b>Meg</b></font>) pretty, white shoulders,
and a pair of high-heeled silk boots satisfied the last wish of her (<font color='blue'><b>Meg</b></font>)
heart. A lace handkerchief, a plumy fan, and a bouquet in a shoulder
holder finished her (<font color='blue'><b>Meg</b></font>) off, and Miss Belle surveyed her (<font color='blue'><b>Belle</b></font>) with the
satisfaction of a little girl with a newly dressed doll.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Mademoiselle is charmante, tres jolie, is she (<font color='blue'><b>Cinderella</b></font>) not?''  (<font color='red'><b>Hortense</b></font>)</div>cried Hortense,
clasping her (<font color='blue'><b>Hortense</b></font>) hands in an affected rapture.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Come and show yourself,''  (<font color='red'><b>Belle/Miss Belle</b></font>)</div>said Miss Belle, leading the way to the room
where the others were waiting.

<p/>As Meg went rustling after, with her (<font color='blue'><b>Meg</b></font>) long skirts trailing, her (<font color='blue'><b>Meg</b></font>) earrings
tinkling, her (<font color='blue'><b>Meg</b></font>) curls waving, and her (<font color='blue'><b>Meg</b></font>) heart beating, she (<font color='blue'><b>Meg</b></font>) felt as if her (<font color='blue'><b>Meg</b></font>)
fun had really begun at last, for the mirror had plainly told her (<font color='blue'><b>Meg</b></font>) that
she (<font color='blue'><b>Meg</b></font>) was 'a little beauty'. Her (<font color='blue'><b>Meg</b></font>) friends repeated the pleasing phrase
enthusiastically, and for several minutes she (<font color='blue'><b>Meg</b></font>) stood, like a jackdaw in
the fable, enjoying her (<font color='blue'><b>Meg</b></font>) borrowed plumes, while the rest chattered like
a party of magpies.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``While I dress, do you drill her (<font color='blue'><b>Cinderella</b></font>), Nan, in the management of her (<font color='blue'><b>Nan</b></font>) skirt
and those French heels, or she (<font color='blue'><b>Nan</b></font>) will trip herself up. Take your silver
butterfly, and catch up that long curl on the left side of her (<font color='blue'><b>Nan</b></font>) head,
Clara, and don't any of you disturb the charming work of my hands,''
 (<font color='red'><b>Belle/Miss Belle</b></font>)</div>said Belle, as she (<font color='blue'><b>Belle</b></font>) hurried away, looking well pleased with her (<font color='blue'><b>Belle</b></font>) success.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``You don't look a bit like yourself, but you are very nice. I'm nowhere
beside you, for Belle has heaps of taste, and you're quite French, I
assure you. Let your flowers hang, don't be so careful of them, and be
sure you don't trip,''  (<font color='red'><b>Sallie/Miss Sallie</b></font>)</div>returned Sallie, trying not to care that Meg was
prettier than herself.

<p/>Keeping that warning carefully in mind, Margaret got safely down stairs
and sailed into the drawing rooms where the Moffats and a few early
guests were assembled. She (<font color='blue'><b>Margaret</b></font>) very soon discovered that there is a charm
about fine clothes which attracts a certain class of people and secures
their respect. Several young ladies, who had taken no notice of her (<font color='blue'><b>Margaret</b></font>)
before, were very affectionate all of a sudden. Several young
gentlemen, who had only stared at her (<font color='blue'><b>Margaret</b></font>) at the other party, now not only
stared, but asked to be introduced, and said all manner of foolish but
agreeable things to her (<font color='blue'><b>Margaret</b></font>), and several old ladies, who sat on the sofas,
and criticized the rest of the party, inquired who she (<font color='blue'><b>Margaret</b></font>) was with an air
of interest. She (<font color='blue'><b>Margaret</b></font>) heard Mrs. Moffat reply to one of them...

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Daisy March--father a colonel in the army--one of our first families,
but reverses of fortune, you know; intimate friends of the Laurences;
sweet creature, I assure you; my Ned is quite wild about her (<font color='blue'><b>Daisy</b></font>).''

 (<font color='red'><b>Mrs. Moffat</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Dear me!''  (<font color='red'><b>the lady</b></font>)</div>said the old lady, putting up her (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) glass for another
observation of Meg, who tried to look as if she (<font color='blue'><b>Meg</b></font>) had not heard and been
rather shocked at Mrs. Moffat's fibs. The `queer feeling' did not pass
away, but she (<font color='blue'><b>Moffat</b></font>) imagined herself acting the new part of fine lady and so
got on pretty well, though the tight dress gave her (<font color='blue'><b>Moffat</b></font>) a side-ache, the
train kept getting under her (<font color='blue'><b>Moffat</b></font>) feet, and she (<font color='blue'><b>Moffat</b></font>) was in constant fear lest
her (<font color='blue'><b>Moffat</b></font>) earrings should fly off and get lost or broken. She (<font color='blue'><b>Moffat</b></font>) was flirting
her (<font color='blue'><b>Moffat</b></font>) fan and laughing at the feeble jokes of a young gentleman who tried
to be witty, when she (<font color='blue'><b>Moffat</b></font>) suddenly stopped laughing and looked confused,
for just opposite, she (<font color='blue'><b>Moffat</b></font>) saw Laurie. He (<font color='blue'><b>Laurie</b></font>) was staring at her (<font color='blue'><b>Moffat</b></font>) with
undisguised surprise, and disapproval also, she (<font color='blue'><b>Moffat</b></font>) thought, for though he (<font color='blue'><b>Laurie</b></font>)
bowed and smiled, yet something in his (<font color='blue'><b>Laurie</b></font>) honest eyes made her (<font color='blue'><b>Moffat</b></font>) blush and
wish she (<font color='blue'><b>Moffat</b></font>) had her (<font color='blue'><b>Moffat</b></font>) old dress on. To complete her (<font color='blue'><b>Moffat</b></font>) confusion, she (<font color='blue'><b>Moffat</b></font>) saw Belle
nudge Annie, and both glance from her (<font color='blue'><b>Moffat</b></font>) to Laurie, who, she (<font color='blue'><b>Moffat</b></font>) was happy to
see, looked unusually boyish and shy.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Silly creatures, to put such thoughts into my head. I won't care for
it, or let it change me a bit,''  (<font color='red'><b>Meg</b></font>)</div>thought Meg, and rustled across the
room to shake hands with her (<font color='blue'><b>Meg</b></font>) friend.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``I'm glad you came, I was afraid you wouldn't.''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Meg</b></font>) said, with her (<font color='blue'><b>Meg</b></font>) most
grown-up air.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Jo wanted me to come, and tell her (<font color='blue'><b>Jo</b></font>) how you looked, so I did,''  (<font color='red'><b>Laurie/Mr. Laurie/LAURIE</b></font>)</div>answered
Laurie, without turning his (<font color='blue'><b>Laurie</b></font>) eyes upon her (<font color='blue'><b>Meg</b></font>), though he (<font color='blue'><b>Laurie</b></font>) half smiled at her (<font color='blue'><b>Meg</b></font>)
maternal tone.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``What shall you tell her (<font color='blue'><b>Jo</b></font>)?''  (<font color='red'><b>Meg</b></font>)</div>asked Meg, full of curiosity to know his (<font color='blue'><b>Laurie</b></font>)
opinion of her (<font color='blue'><b>Meg</b></font>), yet feeling ill at ease with him (<font color='blue'><b>Laurie</b></font>) for the first time.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``I shall say I didn't know you, for you look so grown-up and unlike
yourself, I'm quite afraid of you,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Laurie</b></font>) said, fumbling at his (<font color='blue'><b>Laurie</b></font>) glove
button.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``How absurd of you! The girls dressed me up for fun, and I rather like
it. Wouldn't Jo stare if she (<font color='blue'><b>Jo</b></font>) saw me?''  (<font color='red'><b>Meg</b></font>)</div>said Meg, bent on making him (<font color='blue'><b>Laurie</b></font>) say
whether he (<font color='blue'><b>Laurie</b></font>) thought her (<font color='blue'><b>Meg</b></font>) improved or not.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Yes, I think she (<font color='blue'><b>Jo</b></font>) would,''  (<font color='red'><b>Laurie/Mr. Laurie/LAURIE</b></font>)</div>returned Laurie gravely.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Don't you like me so?''  (<font color='red'><b>Meg</b></font>)</div>asked Meg.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``No, I don't,''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>was the blunt reply.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Why not?''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>in an anxious tone.

<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Laurie</b></font>) glanced at her (<font color='blue'><b>Meg</b></font>) frizzled head, bare shoulders, and fantastically
trimmed dress with an expression that abashed her (<font color='blue'><b>Meg</b></font>) more than his (<font color='blue'><b>Laurie</b></font>) answer,
which had not a particle of his (<font color='blue'><b>Laurie</b></font>) usual politeness in it.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``I don't like fuss and feathers.''

 (<font color='red'><b>a lad</b></font>)</div><p/>That was altogether too much from a lad younger than herself, and Meg
walked away, saying petulantly, <div class="bookquote">``You are the rudest boy I ever saw.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Meg</b></font>)</div><p/>Feeling very much ruffled, she (<font color='blue'><b>Meg</b></font>) went and stood at a quiet window to cool
her (<font color='blue'><b>Meg</b></font>) cheeks, for the tight dress gave her (<font color='blue'><b>Meg</b></font>) an uncomfortably brilliant
color. As she (<font color='blue'><b>Meg</b></font>) stood there, Major Lincoln passed by, and a minute after
she (<font color='blue'><b>Meg</b></font>) heard him (<font color='blue'><b>Lincoln</b></font>) saying to his (<font color='blue'><b>Lincoln</b></font>) mother...

<p/><div class="bookquote">``They are making a fool of that little girl. I wanted you to see her (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>),
but they have spoiled her (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) entirely. She (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>)'s nothing but a doll tonight.''

 (<font color='red'><b>mother</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Oh, dear!''  (<font color='red'><b>Meg</b></font>)</div>sighed Meg. <div class="bookquote">``I wish I'd been sensible and worn my own
things, then I should not have disgusted other people, or felt so
uncomfortable and ashamed of myself.''

 (<font color='red'><b>She</b></font>)</div><p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>Meg</b></font>) leaned her (<font color='blue'><b>Meg</b></font>) forehead on the cool pane, and stood half hidden by the
curtains, never minding that her (<font color='blue'><b>Meg</b></font>) favorite waltz had begun, till some
one touched her (<font color='blue'><b>Meg</b></font>), and turning, she (<font color='blue'><b>Meg</b></font>) saw Laurie, looking penitent, as he (<font color='blue'><b>Laurie</b></font>)
said, with his (<font color='blue'><b>Laurie</b></font>) very best bow and his (<font color='blue'><b>Laurie</b></font>) hand out...

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Please forgive my rudeness, and come and dance with me.''

 (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I'm afraid it will be too disagreeable to you,''  (<font color='red'><b>Meg</b></font>)</div>said Meg, trying to
look offended and failing entirely.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Not a bit of it, I'm dying to do it. Come, I'll be good. I don't like
your gown, but I do think you are just splendid.''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>And he (<font color='blue'><b>Laurie</b></font>) waved his (<font color='blue'><b>Laurie</b></font>)
hands, as if words failed to express his (<font color='blue'><b>Laurie</b></font>) admiration.

<p/>Meg smiled and relented, and whispered as they stood waiting to catch
the time, <div class="bookquote">``Take care my skirt doesn't trip you up. It's the plague of
my life and I was a goose to wear it.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Meg</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Pin it round your neck, and then it will be useful,''  (<font color='red'><b>Laurie/Mr. Laurie/LAURIE</b></font>)</div>said Laurie,
looking down at the little blue boots, which he (<font color='blue'><b>Laurie</b></font>) evidently approved of.

<p/>Away they went fleetly and gracefully, for having practiced at home,
they were well matched, and the blithe young couple were a pleasant
sight to see, as they twirled merrily round and round, feeling more
friendly than ever after their small tiff.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Laurie, I want you to do me a favor, will you?''  (<font color='red'><b>Meg</b></font>)</div>said Meg, as he (<font color='blue'><b>Laurie</b></font>) stood
fanning her (<font color='blue'><b>Meg</b></font>) when her (<font color='blue'><b>Meg</b></font>) breath gave out, which it did very soon though she (<font color='blue'><b>Meg</b></font>)
would not own why.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Won't I!''  (<font color='red'><b>Laurie/Mr. Laurie/LAURIE</b></font>)</div>said Laurie, with alacrity.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Please don't tell them at home about my dress tonight. They won't
understand the joke, and it will worry Mother.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Then why did you do it?''  (<font color='red'><b>Laurie/Mr. Laurie/LAURIE</b></font>)</div>said Laurie's eyes, so plainly that Meg
hastily added...

<p/><div class="bookquote">``I shall tell them myself all about it, and `fess' to Mother how silly
I've been. But I'd rather do it myself. So you'll not tell, will you?''

 (<font color='red'><b>Meg</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I give you my word I won't, only what shall I say when they ask me?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Just say I looked pretty well and was having a good time.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I'll say the first with all my heart, but how about the other? You
don't look as if you were having a good time. Are you?''  (<font color='red'><b>Laurie/Mr. Laurie/LAURIE</b></font>)</div>And Laurie
looked at her (<font color='blue'><b>Meg</b></font>) with an expression which made her (<font color='blue'><b>Meg</b></font>) answer in a whisper...

<p/><div class="bookquote">``No, not just now. Don't think I'm horrid. I only wanted a little
fun, but this sort doesn't pay, I find, and I'm getting tired of it.''

 (<font color='red'><b>her</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Here comes Ned Moffat. What does he (<font color='blue'><b>Moffat</b></font>) want?''  (<font color='red'><b>Laurie/Mr. Laurie/LAURIE</b></font>)</div>said Laurie, knitting his (<font color='blue'><b>Laurie</b></font>)
black brows as if he (<font color='blue'><b>Laurie</b></font>) did not regard his (<font color='blue'><b>Laurie</b></font>) young host in the light of a
pleasant addition to the party.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``He (<font color='blue'><b>Moffat</b></font>) put his (<font color='blue'><b>Moffat</b></font>) name down for three dances, and I suppose he (<font color='blue'><b>Moffat</b></font>)'s coming for
them. What a bore!''  (<font color='red'><b>Meg</b></font>)</div>said Meg, assuming a languid air which amused
Laurie immensely.

<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Laurie</b></font>) did not speak to her (<font color='blue'><b>Meg</b></font>) again till suppertime, when he (<font color='blue'><b>Laurie</b></font>) saw her (<font color='blue'><b>Meg</b></font>) drinking
champagne with Ned and his (<font color='blue'><b>Ned</b></font>) friend Fisher, who were behaving `like a
pair of fools', as Laurie said to himself, for he (<font color='blue'><b>Laurie</b></font>) felt a brotherly sort
of right to watch over the Marches and fight their battles whenever a
defender was needed.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``You'll have a splitting headache tomorrow, if you drink much of that.
I wouldn't, Meg, your mother doesn't like it, you know,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>defender</b></font>) whispered,
leaning over her (<font color='blue'><b>Meg</b></font>) chair, as Ned turned to refill her (<font color='blue'><b>Meg</b></font>) glass and Fisher
stooped to pick up her (<font color='blue'><b>Meg</b></font>) fan.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``I'm not Meg tonight, I'm 'a doll' who does all sorts of crazy things.
Tomorrow I shall put away my `fuss and feathers' and be desperately
good again,''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Meg</b></font>) answered with an affected little laugh.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Wish tomorrow was here, then,''  (<font color='red'><b>Laurie/Mr. Laurie/LAURIE</b></font>)</div>muttered Laurie, walking off,
ill-pleased at the change he (<font color='blue'><b>Laurie</b></font>) saw in her (<font color='blue'><b>Meg</b></font>).

<p/>Meg danced and flirted, chattered and giggled, as the other girls did.
After supper she (<font color='blue'><b>Meg</b></font>) undertook the German, and blundered through it, nearly
upsetting her (<font color='blue'><b>Meg</b></font>) partner with her (<font color='blue'><b>Meg</b></font>) long skirt, and romping in a way that
scandalized Laurie, who looked on and meditated a lecture. But he (<font color='blue'><b>Laurie</b></font>) got
no chance to deliver it, for Meg kept away from him (<font color='blue'><b>Laurie</b></font>) till he (<font color='blue'><b>Laurie</b></font>) came to say
good night.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Remember!''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Meg</b></font>) said, trying to smile, for the splitting headache had
already begun.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Silence a la mort,''  (<font color='red'><b>Laurie/Mr. Laurie/LAURIE</b></font>)</div>replied Laurie, with a melodramatic flourish, as
he (<font color='blue'><b>Laurie</b></font>) went away.

<p/>This little bit of byplay excited Annie's curiosity, but Meg was too
tired for gossip and went to bed, feeling as if she (<font color='blue'><b>Meg</b></font>) had been to a
masquerade and hadn't enjoyed herself as much as she (<font color='blue'><b>Meg</b></font>) expected. She (<font color='blue'><b>Meg</b></font>) was
sick all the next day, and on Saturday went home, quite used up with
her (<font color='blue'><b>Meg</b></font>) fortnight's fun and feeling that she (<font color='blue'><b>Meg</b></font>) had `sat in the lap of luxury'
long enough.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``It does seem pleasant to be quiet, and not have company manners on all
the time. Home is a nice place, though it isn't splendid,''  (<font color='red'><b>Meg</b></font>)</div>said Meg,
looking about her (<font color='blue'><b>Meg</b></font>) with a restful expression, as she (<font color='blue'><b>Meg</b></font>) sat with her (<font color='blue'><b>Meg</b></font>) mother
and Jo on the Sunday evening.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``I'm glad to hear you say so, dear, for I was afraid home would seem
dull and poor to you after your fine quarters,''  (<font color='red'><b>mother</b></font>)</div>replied her (<font color='blue'><b>Meg</b></font>) mother, who
had given her (<font color='blue'><b>Meg</b></font>) many anxious looks that day. For motherly eyes are quick
to see any change in children's faces.

<p/>Meg had told her (<font color='blue'><b>Meg</b></font>) adventures gayly and said over and over what a
charming time she (<font color='blue'><b>Meg</b></font>) had had, but something still seemed to weigh upon her (<font color='blue'><b>Meg</b></font>)
spirits, and when the younger girls were gone to bed, she (<font color='blue'><b>Meg</b></font>) sat
thoughtfully staring at the fire, saying little and looking worried.
As the clock struck nine and Jo proposed bed, Meg suddenly left her (<font color='blue'><b>Meg</b></font>)
chair and, taking Beth's stool, leaned her (<font color='blue'><b>Meg</b></font>) elbows on her (<font color='blue'><b>Meg</b></font>) mother's knee,
saying bravely...

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Marmee, I want to `fess'.''

 (<font color='red'><b>mother</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I thought so. What is it, dear?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Shall I go away?''  (<font color='red'><b>Jo/Miss Jo/JO</b></font>)</div>asked Jo discreetly.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Of course not. Don't I always tell you everything? I was ashamed to
speak of it before the younger children, but I want you to know all the
dreadful things I did at the Moffats'.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``We are prepared,''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>said Mrs. March, smiling but looking a little
anxious.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``I told you they dressed me up, but I didn't tell you that they
powdered and squeezed and frizzled, and made me look like a
fashion-plate. Laurie thought I wasn't proper. I know he (<font color='blue'><b>Laurie</b></font>) did, though
he (<font color='blue'><b>Laurie</b></font>) didn't say so, and one man called me 'a doll'. I knew it was silly,
but they flattered me and said I was a beauty, and quantities of
nonsense, so I let them make a fool of me.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Is that all?''  (<font color='red'><b>Jo/Miss Jo/JO</b></font>)</div>asked Jo, as Mrs. March looked silently at the downcast
face of her (<font color='blue'><b>Jo</b></font>) pretty daughter, and could not find it in her (<font color='blue'><b>Jo</b></font>) heart to
blame her (<font color='blue'><b>Jo</b></font>) little follies.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``No, I drank champagne and romped and tried to flirt, and was
altogether abominable,''  (<font color='red'><b>Meg</b></font>)</div>said Meg self-reproachfully.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``There is something more, I think.''  (<font color='red'><b>Meg</b></font>)</div>And Mrs. March smoothed the soft
cheek, which suddenly grew rosy as Meg answered slowly...

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Yes. It's very silly, but I want to tell it, because I hate to have
people say and think such things about us and Laurie.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Meg</b></font>)</div><p/>Then she (<font color='blue'><b>Meg</b></font>) told the various bits of gossip she (<font color='blue'><b>Meg</b></font>) had heard at the Moffats',
and as she (<font color='blue'><b>Meg</b></font>) spoke, Jo saw her (<font color='blue'><b>Jo</b></font>) mother fold her (<font color='blue'><b>Jo</b></font>) lips tightly, as if ill
pleased that such ideas should be put into Meg's innocent mind.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Well, if that isn't the greatest rubbish I ever heard,''  (<font color='red'><b>Jo/Miss Jo/JO</b></font>)</div>cried Jo
indignantly. <div class="bookquote">``Why didn't you pop out and tell them so on the spot?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I couldn't, it was so embarrassing for me. I couldn't help hearing at
first, and then I was so angry and ashamed, I didn't remember that I
ought to go away.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Just wait till I see Annie Moffat, and I'll show you how to settle
such ridiculous stuff. The idea of having `plans' and being kind to
Laurie because he (<font color='blue'><b>Laurie</b></font>)'s rich and may marry us by-and-by! Won't he (<font color='blue'><b>Laurie</b></font>) shout
when I tell him (<font color='blue'><b>Laurie</b></font>) what those silly things say about us poor children?''
 (<font color='red'><b>Jo/Miss Jo/JO</b></font>)</div>And Jo laughed, as if on second thoughts the thing struck her (<font color='blue'><b>Jo</b></font>) as a good
joke.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``If you tell Laurie, I'll never forgive you! She (<font color='blue'><b>Moffat</b></font>) mustn't, must she (<font color='blue'><b>Moffat</b></font>),
Mother?''  (<font color='red'><b>Meg</b></font>)</div>said Meg, looking distressed.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``No, never repeat that foolish gossip, and forget it as soon as you
can,''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>said Mrs. March gravely. <div class="bookquote">``I was very unwise to let you go among
people of whom I know so little, kind, I dare say, but worldly,
ill-bred, and full of these vulgar ideas about young people. I am more
sorry than I can express for the mischief this visit may have done you,
Meg.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Don't be sorry, I won't let it hurt me. I'll forget all the bad and
remember only the good, for I did enjoy a great deal, and thank you
very much for letting me go. I'll not be sentimental or dissatisfied,
Mother. I know I'm a silly little girl, and I'll stay with you till
I'm fit to take care of myself. But it is nice to be praised and
admired, and I can't help saying I like it,''  (<font color='red'><b>Meg</b></font>)</div>said Meg, looking half
ashamed of the confession.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``That is perfectly natural, and quite harmless, if the liking does not
become a passion and lead one to do foolish or unmaidenly things.
Learn to know and value the praise which is worth having, and to excite
the admiration of excellent people by being modest as well as pretty,
Meg.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Margaret/Miss Margaret</b></font>)</div><p/>Margaret sat thinking a moment, while Jo stood with her (<font color='blue'><b>Jo</b></font>) hands behind
her (<font color='blue'><b>Jo</b></font>), looking both interested and a little perplexed, for it was a new
thing to see Meg blushing and talking about admiration, lovers, and
things of that sort. And Jo felt as if during that fortnight her (<font color='blue'><b>Jo</b></font>)
sister had grown up amazingly, and was drifting away from her (<font color='blue'><b>Jo</b></font>) into a
world where she (<font color='blue'><b>Jo</b></font>) could not follow.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Mother, do you have `plans', as Mrs. Moffat said?''  (<font color='red'><b>Meg</b></font>)</div>asked Meg bashfully.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Yes, my dear, I have a great many, all mothers do, but mine differ
somewhat from Mrs. Moffat's, I suspect. I will tell you some of them,
for the time has come when a word may set this romantic little head and
heart of yours right, on a very serious subject. You are young, Meg,
but not too young to understand me, and mothers' lips are the fittest
to speak of such things to girls like you. Jo, your turn will come in
time, perhaps, so listen to my `plans' and help me carry them out, if
they are good.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Jo/Miss Jo/JO</b></font>)</div><p/>Jo went and sat on one arm of the chair, looking as if she (<font color='blue'><b>Jo</b></font>) thought they
were about to join in some very solemn affair. Holding a hand of each,
and watching the two young faces wistfully, Mrs. March said, in her (<font color='blue'><b>Jo</b></font>)
serious yet cheery way...

<p/><div class="bookquote">``I want my daughters to be beautiful, accomplished, and good. To be
admired, loved, and respected. To have a happy youth, to be well and
wisely married, and to lead useful, pleasant lives, with as little care
and sorrow to try them as God sees fit to send. To be loved and chosen
by a good man is the best and sweetest thing which can happen to a
woman, and I sincerely hope my girls may know this beautiful
experience. It is natural to think of it, Meg, right to hope and wait
for it, and wise to prepare for it, so that when the happy time comes,
you may feel ready for the duties and worthy of the joy. My dear
girls, I am ambitious for you, but not to have you make a dash in the
world, marry rich men merely because they are rich, or have splendid
houses, which are not homes because love is wanting. Money is a
needful and precious thing, and when well used, a noble thing, but I
never want you to think it is the first or only prize to strive for.
I'd rather see you poor men's wives, if you were happy, beloved,
contented, than queens on thrones, without self-respect and peace.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Poor girls don't stand any chance, Belle says, unless they put
themselves forward,''  (<font color='red'><b>Meg</b></font>)</div>sighed Meg.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Then we'll be old maids,''  (<font color='red'><b>Jo/Miss Jo/JO</b></font>)</div>said Jo stoutly.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Right, Jo. Better be happy old maids than unhappy wives, or
unmaidenly girls, running about to find husbands,''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>said Mrs. March
decidedly. <div class="bookquote">``Don't be troubled, Meg, poverty seldom daunts a sincere
lover. Some of the best and most honored women I know were poor girls,
but so love-worthy that they were not allowed to be old maids. Leave
these things to time. Make this home happy, so that you may be fit for
homes of your own, if they are offered you, and contented here if they
are not. One thing remember, my girls. Mother is always ready to be
your confidant, Father to be your friend, and both of us hope and trust
that our daughters, whether married or single, will be the pride and
comfort of our lives.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``We will, Marmee, we will!''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>cried both, with all their hearts, as she (<font color='blue'><b>Meg</b></font>)
bade them good night.



<p/>CHAPTER TEN

<p/>THE P.C. AND P.O..

<p/>As spring came on, a new set of amusements became the fashion, and the
lengthening days gave long afternoons for work and play of all sorts.
The garden had to be put in order, and each sister had a quarter of the
little plot to do what she (<font color='blue'><b>sister</b></font>) liked with. Hannah used to say, <div class="bookquote">``I'd know
which each of them gardings belonged to, ef I see 'em in Chiny,''  (<font color='red'><b>Hannah</b></font>)</div>and so
she (<font color='blue'><b>Hannah</b></font>) might, for the girls' tastes differed as much as their characters.
Meg's had roses and heliotrope, myrtle, and a little orange tree in it.
Jo's bed was never alike two seasons, for she (<font color='blue'><b>Jo</b></font>) was always trying
experiments. This year it was to be a plantation of sun flowers, the
seeds of which cheerful and aspiring plant were to feed Aunt
Cockle-top and her (<font color='blue'><b>Aunt</b></font>) family of chicks. Beth had old-fashioned fragrant
flowers in her (<font color='blue'><b>Beth</b></font>) garden, sweet peas and mignonette, larkspur, pinks,
pansies, and southernwood, with chickweed for the birds and catnip for
the pussies. Amy had a bower in hers, rather small and earwiggy, but
very pretty to look at, with honeysuckle and morning-glories hanging
their colored horns and bells in graceful wreaths all over it, tall
white lilies, delicate ferns, and as many brilliant, picturesque plants
as would consent to blossom there.

<p/>Gardening, walks, rows on the river, and flower hunts employed the fine
days, and for rainy ones, they had house diversions, some old, some
new, all more or less original. One of these was the <div class="bookquote">``P.C.'''  (<font color='red'><b>the girls</b></font>)</div>for as
secret societies were the fashion, it was thought proper to have one,
and as all of the girls admired Dickens, they called themselves the
Pickwick Club. With a few interruptions, they had kept this up for a
year, and met every Saturday evening in the big garret, on which
occasions the ceremonies were as follows: Three chairs were arranged
in a row before a table on which was a lamp, also four white badges,
with a big <div class="bookquote">``P.C.''  (<font color='red'><b>Jo/Miss Jo/JO</b></font>)</div>in different colors on each, and the weekly newspaper
called, The Pickwick Portfolio, to which all contributed something,
while Jo, who reveled in pens and ink, was the editor. At seven
o'clock, the four members ascended to the clubroom, tied their badges
round their heads, and took their seats with great solemnity. Meg, as
the eldest, was Samuel Pickwick, Jo, being of a literary turn, Augustus
Snodgrass, Beth, because she (<font color='blue'><b>Beth</b></font>) was round and rosy, Tracy Tupman, and Amy,
who was always trying to do what she (<font color='blue'><b>Amy</b></font>) couldn't, was Nathaniel Winkle.
Pickwick, the president, read the paper, which was filled with original
tales, poetry, local news, funny advertisements, and hints, in which
they good-naturedly reminded each other of their faults and short
comings. On one occasion, Mr. Pickwick put on a pair of spectacles
without any glass, rapped upon the table, hemmed, and having stared
hard at Mr. Snodgrass, who was tilting back in his (<font color='blue'><b>Snodgrass</b></font>) chair, till he (<font color='blue'><b>Snodgrass</b></font>)
arranged himself properly, began to read:

<p/>POET``S CORNER

<p/>ANNIVERSARY ODE


<p/>Again we meet to celebrate
With badge and solemn rite,
Our fifty-second anniversary,
In Pickwick Hall, tonight.

<p/>We all are here in perfect health,
None gone from our small band:
Again we see each well-known face,
And press each friendly hand.

<p/>Our Pickwick, always at his (<font color='blue'><b>we</b></font>) post,
With reverence we greet,
As, spectacles on nose, he (<font color='blue'><b>we</b></font>) reads
Our well-filled weekly sheet.

<p/>Although he (<font color='blue'><b>we</b></font>) suffers from a cold,
We joy to hear him (<font color='blue'><b>we</b></font>) speak,
For words of wisdom from him (<font color='blue'><b>we</b></font>) fall,
In spite of croak or squeak.

<p/>Old six-foot Snodgrass looms on high,
With elephantine grace,
And beams upon the company,
With brown and jovial face.

<p/>Poetic fire lights up his (<font color='blue'><b>Snodgrass</b></font>) eye,
He (<font color='blue'><b>Snodgrass</b></font>) struggles `gainst his (<font color='blue'><b>Snodgrass</b></font>) lot.
Behold ambition on his (<font color='blue'><b>Snodgrass</b></font>) brow,
And on his (<font color='blue'><b>Snodgrass</b></font>) nose, a blot.

<p/>Next our peaceful Tupman comes,
So rosy, plump, and sweet,
Who chokes with laughter at the puns,
And tumbles off his (<font color='blue'><b>Snodgrass</b></font>) seat.

<p/>Prim little Winkle too is here,
With every hair in place,
A model of propriety,
Though he (<font color='blue'><b>Winkle</b></font>) hates to wash his (<font color='blue'><b>Winkle</b></font>) face.

<p/>The year is gone, we still unite
To joke and laugh and read,
And tread the path of literature
That doth to glory lead.

<p/>Long may our paper prosper well,
Our club unbroken be,
And coming years their blessings pour
On the useful, gay <div class="bookquote">``P. C.'' (<font color='red'><b>Long</b></font>)</div>.

<p/>THE MASKED MARRIAGE
-LRB-A Tale Of Venice-RRB-

<p/>Gondola after gondola swept up to the marble
steps, and left its lovely load to swell the
brilliant throng that filled the stately halls of Count
Adelon. Knights and ladies, elves and pages, monks
and flower girls, all mingled gaily in the dance.
Sweet voices and rich melody filled the air, and so
with mirth and music the masquerade went on.
<div class="bookquote">``Has your Highness seen the Lady Viola tonight?''
 (<font color='red'><b>a troubadour</b></font>)</div>asked a gallant troubadour of the fairy queen who
floated down the hall upon his (<font color='blue'><b>troubadour</b></font>) arm.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Yes, is she (<font color='blue'><b>Viola</b></font>) not lovely, though so sad! Her (<font color='blue'><b>Viola</b></font>)
dress is well chosen, too, for in a week she (<font color='blue'><b>Viola</b></font>) weds
Count Antonio, whom she (<font color='blue'><b>Viola</b></font>) passionately hates.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``By my faith, I envy him (<font color='blue'><b>Antonio</b></font>). Yonder he (<font color='blue'><b>Antonio</b></font>) comes,
arrayed like a bridegroom, except the black mask.
When that is off we shall see how he (<font color='blue'><b>Antonio</b></font>) regards the
fair maid whose heart he (<font color='blue'><b>Antonio</b></font>) cannot win, though her (<font color='blue'><b>maid</b></font>)
stern father bestows her (<font color='blue'><b>maid</b></font>) hand,''  (<font color='red'><b>the troubadour</b></font>)</div>returned the troubadour.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Tis whispered that she (<font color='blue'><b>maid</b></font>) loves the young English
artist who haunts her (<font color='blue'><b>maid</b></font>) steps, and is spurned by the
old Count,''  (<font color='red'><b>the lady</b></font>)</div>said the lady, as they joined the dance.
The revel was at its height when a priest
appeared, and withdrawing the young pair to an alcove,
hung with purple velvet, he (<font color='blue'><b>priest</b></font>) motioned them to kneel.
Instant silence fell on the gay throng, and not a
sound, but the dash of fountains or the rustle of
orange groves sleeping in the moonlight, broke the
hush, as Count de Adelon spoke thus:

<p/><div class="bookquote">``My lords and ladies, pardon the ruse by which
I have gathered you here to witness the marriage of
my daughter. Father, we wait your services.''
 (<font color='red'><b>the party</b></font>)</div>All eyes turned toward the bridal party, and a
murmur of amazement went through the throng, for
neither bride nor groom removed their masks. Curiosity
and wonder possessed all hearts, but respect restrained
all tongues till the holy rite was over. Then the
eager spectators gathered round the count, demanding
an explanation.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Gladly would I give it if I could, but I only
know that it was the whim of my timid Viola, and I
yielded to it. Now, my children, let the play end.
Unmask and receive my blessing.''

 (<font color='red'><b>the bridegroom</b></font>)</div><p/>But neither bent the knee, for the young bridegroom
replied in a tone that startled all listeners
as the mask fell, disclosing the noble face of Ferdinand
Devereux, the artist lover, and leaning on the
breast where now flashed the star of an English earl
was the lovely Viola, radiant with joy and beauty.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``My lord, you scornfully bade me claim your
daughter when I could boast as high a name and vast a
fortune as the Count Antonio. I can do more, for even
your ambitious soul cannot refuse the Earl of Devereux
and De Vere, when he (<font color='blue'><b>Earl</b></font>) gives his (<font color='blue'><b>Earl</b></font>) ancient name and boundless
wealth in return for the beloved hand of this fair lady,
now my wife.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Ferdinand</b></font>)</div><p/>The count stood like one changed to stone, and
turning to the bewildered crowd, Ferdinand added, with
a gay smile of triumph, <div class="bookquote">``To you, my gallant friends, I
can only wish that your wooing may prosper as mine has
done, and that you may all win as fair a bride as I have
by this masked marriage.''

<p/>THE HISTORY OF A SQUASH


<p/>Once upon a time a farmer planted a little seed
in his (<font color='blue'><b>farmer</b></font>) garden, and after a while it sprouted and became
a vine and bore many squashes. One day in October,
when they were ripe, he (<font color='blue'><b>farmer</b></font>) picked one and took it
to market. A grocerman bought and put it in his (<font color='blue'><b>farmer</b></font>) shop.
That same morning, a little girl in a brown hat
and blue dress, with a round face and snub nose, went
and bought it for her (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) mother. She (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) lugged it home, cut
it up, and boiled it in the big pot, mashed some of it
with salt and butter, for dinner. And to the rest she (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) added
a pint of milk, two eggs, four spoons of sugar, nutmeg,
and some crackers, put it in a deep dish, and baked it
till it was brown and nice, and next day it was eaten
by a family named March.

<p/>Mr. Pickwick, Sir:--
I address you upon the subject of sin the sinner
I mean is a man named Winkle who makes trouble in his (<font color='blue'><b>Winkle</b></font>)
club by laughing and sometimes won't write his (<font color='blue'><b>Winkle</b></font>) piece in
this fine paper I hope you will pardon his (<font color='blue'><b>Winkle</b></font>) badness and
let him (<font color='blue'><b>Winkle</b></font>) send a French fable because he (<font color='blue'><b>Winkle</b></font>) can't write out
of his (<font color='blue'><b>Winkle</b></font>) head as he (<font color='blue'><b>Winkle</b></font>) has so many lessons to do and no brains
in future I will try to take time by the fetlock and
prepare some work which will be all commy la fo that
means all right I am in haste as it is nearly school
time.
Yours respectably,
N. WINKLE

<p/>A SAD ACCIDENT

<p/>On Friday last, we were startled by a violent shock
in our basement, followed by cries of distress.
On rushing in a body to the cellar, we discovered our beloved
President prostrate upon the floor, having tripped and
fallen while getting wood for domestic purposes. A perfect
scene of ruin met our eyes, for in his (<font color='blue'><b>President</b></font>) fall Mr. Pickwick
had plunged his (<font color='blue'><b>Pickwick</b></font>) head and shoulders into a tub of water,
upset a keg of soft soap upon his (<font color='blue'><b>Pickwick</b></font>) manly form, and torn
his (<font color='blue'><b>Pickwick</b></font>) garments badly. On being removed from this perilous
situation, it was discovered that he (<font color='blue'><b>Pickwick</b></font>) had suffered
no injury but several bruises, and we are happy to add,
is now doing well.

<p/>THE PUBLIC BEREAVEMENT

<p/>It is our painful duty to record the sudden and
mysterious disappearance of our cherished friend, Mrs.
Snowball Pat Paw. This lovely and beloved cat was the
pet of a large circle of warm and admiring friends; for
her (<font color='blue'><b>Pickwick</b></font>) beauty attracted all eyes, her (<font color='blue'><b>Pickwick</b></font>) graces and virtues
endeared her (<font color='blue'><b>Pickwick</b></font>) to all hearts, and her (<font color='blue'><b>Pickwick</b></font>) loss is deeply felt
by the whole community.

<p/>When last seen, she (<font color='blue'><b>Pickwick</b></font>) was sitting at the gate, watching
the butcher's cart, and it is feared that some villain,
tempted by her (<font color='blue'><b>Pickwick</b></font>) charms, basely stole her (<font color='blue'><b>Pickwick</b></font>). Weeks have passed,
but no trace of her (<font color='blue'><b>Pickwick</b></font>) has been discovered, and we relinquish
all hope, tie a black ribbon to her (<font color='blue'><b>Pickwick</b></font>) basket, set aside her (<font color='blue'><b>Pickwick</b></font>)
dish, and weep for her (<font color='blue'><b>Pickwick</b></font>) as one lost to us forever.

<p/>_________

<p/>A sympathizing friend sends the following gem:


<p/>A LAMENT
-LRB-FOR S. B. PAT PAW-RRB-

<p/>We mourn the loss of our little pet,
And sigh o'er her (<font color='blue'><b>Pickwick</b></font>) hapless fate,
For never more by the fire she (<font color='blue'><b>Pickwick</b></font>)'ll sit,
Nor play by the old green gate.

<p/>The little grave where her (<font color='blue'><b>Pickwick</b></font>) infant sleeps
Is `neath the chestnut tree.
But o'er her (<font color='blue'><b>Pickwick</b></font>) grave we may not weep,
We know not where it may be.

<p/>Her (<font color='blue'><b>Pickwick</b></font>) empty bed, her (<font color='blue'><b>Pickwick</b></font>) idle ball,
Will never see her (<font color='blue'><b>Pickwick</b></font>) more;
No gentle tap, no loving purr
Is heard at the parlor door.

<p/>Another cat comes after her (<font color='blue'><b>Pickwick</b></font>) mice,
A cat with a dirty face,
But she (<font color='blue'><b>Pickwick</b></font>) does not hunt as our darling did,
Nor play with her (<font color='blue'><b>Pickwick</b></font>) airy grace.

<p/>Her (<font color='blue'><b>Pickwick</b></font>) stealthy paws tread the very hall
Where Snowball used to play,
But she (<font color='blue'><b>Pickwick</b></font>) only spits at the dogs our pet
So gallantly drove away.

<p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>Pickwick</b></font>) is useful and mild, and does her (<font color='blue'><b>Pickwick</b></font>) best,
But she (<font color='blue'><b>Pickwick</b></font>) is not fair to see,
And we cannot give her (<font color='blue'><b>Pickwick</b></font>) your place dear,
Nor worship her (<font color='blue'><b>Pickwick</b></font>) as we worship thee.

<p/>_________________________________________________


<p/>As the President finished reading the paper -LRB-which I beg leave to
assure my readers is a bona fide copy of one written by bona fide girls
once upon a time-RRB-, a round of applause followed, and then Mr. Snodgrass
rose to make a proposition.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Mr. President and gentlemen,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Snodgrass</b></font>) began, assuming a parliamentary
attitude and tone, <div class="bookquote">``I wish to propose the admission of a new
member--one who highly deserves the honor, would be deeply grateful for
it, and would add immensely to the spirit of the club, the literary
value of the paper, and be no end jolly and nice. I propose Mr.
Theodore Laurence as an honorary member of the P. C. Come now, do
have him (<font color='blue'><b>Mr.</b></font>).''

 (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div><p/>Jo's sudden change of tone made the girls laugh, but all looked rather
anxious, and no one said a word as Snodgrass took his (<font color='blue'><b>Snodgrass</b></font>) seat.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``We'll put it to a vote,''  (<font color='red'><b>the President</b></font>)</div>said the President. <div class="bookquote">``All in favor of this
motion please to manifest it by saying, `Aye'.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Snodgrass/Mr. Snodgrass</b></font>)</div><p/>A loud response from Snodgrass, followed, to everybody's surprise, by a
timid one from Beth.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Contrary-minded say, `No'.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Meg</b></font>)</div><p/>Meg and Amy were contrary-minded, and Mr. Winkle rose to say with great
elegance, <div class="bookquote">``We don't wish any boys, they only joke and bounce about.
This is a ladies' club, and we wish to be private and proper.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Mr.</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I'm afraid he (<font color='blue'><b>Mr.</b></font>)'ll laugh at our paper, and make fun of us afterward,''
 (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>observed Pickwick, pulling the little curl on her (<font color='blue'><b>Meg</b></font>) forehead, as she (<font color='blue'><b>Meg</b></font>)
always did when doubtful.

<p/>Up rose Snodgrass, very much in earnest. <div class="bookquote">``Sir, I give you my word as a
gentleman, Laurie won't do anything of the sort. He (<font color='blue'><b>Laurie</b></font>) likes to write,
and he (<font color='blue'><b>Laurie</b></font>)'ll give a tone to our contributions and keep us from being
sentimental, don't you see? We can do so little for him (<font color='blue'><b>Laurie</b></font>), and he (<font color='blue'><b>Laurie</b></font>) does
so much for us, I think the least we can do is to offer him (<font color='blue'><b>Laurie</b></font>) a place
here, and make him (<font color='blue'><b>Laurie</b></font>) welcome if he (<font color='blue'><b>Laurie</b></font>) comes.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Tupman</b></font>)</div><p/>This artful allusion to benefits conferred brought Tupman to his (<font color='blue'><b>Snodgrass</b></font>) feet,
looking as if he (<font color='blue'><b>Snodgrass</b></font>) had quite made up his (<font color='blue'><b>Snodgrass</b></font>) mind.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Yes; we ought to do it, even if we are afraid. I say he (<font color='blue'><b>Laurie</b></font>) may come, and
his (<font color='blue'><b>Laurie</b></font>) grandpa, too, if he (<font color='blue'><b>Laurie</b></font>) likes.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Beth</b></font>)</div><p/>This spirited burst from Beth electrified the club, and Jo left her (<font color='blue'><b>Jo</b></font>)
seat to shake hands approvingly. <div class="bookquote">``Now then, vote again. Everybody
remember it's our Laurie, and say, `Aye!'''  (<font color='red'><b>Snodgrass/Mr. Snodgrass</b></font>)</div>cried Snodgrass excitedly.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Aye! Aye! Aye!''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>replied three voices at once.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Good! Bless you! Now, as there's nothing like `taking time by the
fetlock', as Winkle characteristically observes, allow me to present
the new member.''  (<font color='red'><b>Jo/Miss Jo/JO</b></font>)</div>And, to the dismay of the rest of the club, Jo threw
open the door of the closet, and displayed Laurie sitting on a rag bag,
flushed and twinkling with suppressed laughter.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``You rogue! You traitor! Jo, how could you?''  (<font color='red'><b>the girls</b></font>)</div>cried the three girls,
as Snodgrass led her (<font color='blue'><b>Jo</b></font>) friend triumphantly forth, and producing both a
chair and a badge, installed him (<font color='blue'><b>Snodgrass</b></font>) in a jiffy.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``The coolness of you two rascals is amazing,''  (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Pickwick</b></font>)</div>began Mr. Pickwick,
trying to get up an awful frown and only succeeding in producing an
amiable smile. But the new member was equal to the occasion, and
rising, with a grateful salutation to the Chair, said in the most
engaging manner, <div class="bookquote">``Mr. President and ladies--I beg pardon,
gentlemen--allow me to introduce myself as Sam Weller, the very humble
servant of the club.''

 (<font color='red'><b>the Chair</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Good! Good!''  (<font color='red'><b>Jo/Miss Jo/JO</b></font>)</div>cried Jo, pounding with the handle of the old warming
pan on which she (<font color='blue'><b>Jo</b></font>) leaned.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``My faithful friend and noble patron,''  (<font color='red'><b>Laurie/Mr. Laurie/LAURIE</b></font>)</div>continued Laurie with a wave of
the hand, <div class="bookquote">``who has so flatteringly presented me, is not to be blamed
for the base stratagem of tonight. I planned it, and she (<font color='blue'><b>Jo</b></font>) only gave in
after lots of teasing.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Laurie/Mr. Laurie/LAURIE</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Come now, don't lay it all on yourself. You know I proposed the
cupboard,''  (<font color='red'><b>Snodgrass/Mr. Snodgrass</b></font>)</div>broke in Snodgrass, who was enjoying the joke amazingly.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Never mind what she (<font color='blue'><b>Jo</b></font>) says. I'm the wretch that did it, sir,''  (<font color='red'><b>the member</b></font>)</div>said the
new member, with a Welleresque nod to Mr. Pickwick. <div class="bookquote">``But on my honor,
I never will do so again, and henceforth devote myself to the interest
of this immortal club.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Hear! Hear!''  (<font color='red'><b>Jo/Miss Jo/JO</b></font>)</div>cried Jo, clashing the lid of the warming pan like a
cymbal.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Go on, go on!''  (<font color='red'><b>Winkle</b></font>)</div>added Winkle and Tupman, while the President bowed
benignly.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``I merely wish to say, that as a slight token of my gratitude for the
honor done me, and as a means of promoting friendly relations between
adjoining nations, I have set up a post office in the hedge in the
lower corner of the garden, a fine, spacious building with padlocks on
the doors and every convenience for the mails, also the females, if I
may be allowed the expression. It's the old martin house, but I've
stopped up the door and made the roof open, so it will hold all sorts
of things, and save our valuable time. Letters, manuscripts, books,
and bundles can be passed in there, and as each nation has a key, it
will be uncommonly nice, I fancy. Allow me to present the club key,
and with many thanks for your favor, take my seat.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Mr.</b></font>)</div><p/>Great applause as Mr. Weller deposited a little key on the table and
subsided, the warming pan clashed and waved wildly, and it was some
time before order could be restored. A long discussion followed, and
everyone came out surprising, for everyone did her (<font color='blue'><b>Jo</b></font>) best. So it was an
unusually lively meeting, and did not adjourn till a late hour, when it
broke up with three shrill cheers for the new member.

<p/>No one ever regretted the admittance of Sam Weller, for a more devoted,
well-behaved, and jovial member no club could have. He (<font color='blue'><b>member</b></font>) certainly did
add `spirit' to the meetings, and 'a tone' to the paper, for his (<font color='blue'><b>member</b></font>)
orations convulsed his (<font color='blue'><b>member</b></font>) hearers and his (<font color='blue'><b>member</b></font>) contributions were excellent,
being patriotic, classical, comical, or dramatic, but never
sentimental. Jo regarded them as worthy of Bacon, Milton, or
Shakespeare, and remodeled her (<font color='blue'><b>Jo</b></font>) own works with good effect, she (<font color='blue'><b>Jo</b></font>) thought.

<p/>The P. O. was a capital little institution, and flourished
wonderfully, for nearly as many queer things passed through it as
through the real post office. Tragedies and cravats, poetry and
pickles, garden seeds and long letters, music and gingerbread, rubbers,
invitations, scoldings, and puppies. The old gentleman liked the fun,
and amused himself by sending odd bundles, mysterious messages, and
funny telegrams, and his (<font color='blue'><b>gentleman</b></font>) gardener, who was smitten with Hannah's
charms, actually sent a love letter to Jo's care. How they laughed
when the secret came out, never dreaming how many love letters that
little post office would hold in the years to come.



<p/>CHAPTER ELEVEN

<p/>EXPERIMENTS

<p/><div class="bookquote">``The first of June! The Kings are off to the seashore tomorrow, and
I'm free. Three months' vacation--how I shall enjoy it!''  (<font color='red'><b>Meg</b></font>)</div>exclaimed
Meg, coming home one warm day to find Jo laid upon the sofa in an
unusual state of exhaustion, while Beth took off her (<font color='blue'><b>Beth</b></font>) dusty boots, and
Amy made lemonade for the refreshment of the whole party.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Aunt March went today, for which, oh, be joyful!''  (<font color='red'><b>Jo/Miss Jo/JO</b></font>)</div>said Jo. ``I was
mortally afraid she (<font color='blue'><b>Aunt</b></font>)'d ask me to go with her (<font color='blue'><b>Aunt</b></font>). If she (<font color='blue'><b>Aunt</b></font>) had, I should have
felt as if I ought to do it, but Plumfield is about as gay as a
churchyard, you know, and I'd rather be excused. We had a flurry
getting the old lady off, and I had a fright every time she (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) spoke to
me, for I was in such a hurry to be through that I was uncommonly
helpful and sweet, and feared she (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>)'d find it impossible to part from me.
I quaked till she (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) was fairly in the carriage, and had a final fright,
for as it drove of, she (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) popped out her (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) head, saying, ``Josyphine, won't
you--?<div class="bookquote">'' I didn't hear any more, for I basely turned and fled. I did
actually run, and whisked round the corner where I felt safe.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Poor old Jo! She (<font color='blue'><b>Jo</b></font>) came in looking as if bears were after her (<font color='blue'><b>Jo</b></font>),''  (<font color='red'><b>Beth</b></font>)</div>said
Beth, as she (<font color='blue'><b>Beth</b></font>) cuddled her (<font color='blue'><b>Beth</b></font>) sister's feet with a motherly air.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Aunt March is a regular samphire, is she (<font color='blue'><b>Aunt</b></font>) not?''  (<font color='red'><b>Amy/Amy March</b></font>)</div>observed Amy, tasting
her (<font color='blue'><b>Amy</b></font>) mixture critically.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``She (<font color='blue'><b>Aunt</b></font>) means vampire, not seaweed, but it doesn't matter. It's too warm
to be particular about one's parts of speech,''  (<font color='red'><b>Jo/Miss Jo/JO</b></font>)</div>murmured Jo.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``What shall you do all your vacation?''  (<font color='red'><b>Amy/Amy March</b></font>)</div>asked Amy, changing the subject
with tact.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``I shall lie abed late, and do nothing,''  (<font color='red'><b>Meg</b></font>)</div>replied Meg, from the depths
of the rocking chair. <div class="bookquote">``I've been routed up early all winter and had to
spend my days working for other people, so now I'm going to rest and
revel to my heart's content.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``No,''  (<font color='red'><b>Jo/Miss Jo/JO</b></font>)</div>said Jo, <div class="bookquote">``that dozy way wouldn't suit me. I've laid in a heap of
books, and I'm going to improve my shining hours reading on my perch in
the old apple tree, when I'm not having l--''

 (<font color='red'><b>Jo/Miss Jo/JO</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Don't say `larks!'''  (<font color='red'><b>Amy/Amy March</b></font>)</div>implored Amy, as a return snub for the `samphire'
correction.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``I'll say `nightingales' then, with Laurie. That's proper and
appropriate, since he (<font color='blue'><b>Laurie</b></font>)'s a warbler.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Don't let us do any lessons, Beth, for a while, but play all the time
and rest, as the girls mean to,''  (<font color='red'><b>Amy/Amy March</b></font>)</div>proposed Amy.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Well, I will, if Mother doesn't mind. I want to learn some new songs,
and my children need fitting up for the summer. They are dreadfully
out of order and really suffering for clothes.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``May we, Mother?''  (<font color='red'><b>Meg</b></font>)</div>asked Meg, turning to Mrs. March, who sat sewing in
what they called ``Marmee's corner'.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``You may try your experiment for a week and see how you like it. I
think by Saturday night you will find that all play and no work is as
bad as all work and no play.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Oh, dear, no! It will be delicious, I'm sure,''  (<font color='red'><b>Meg</b></font>)</div>said Meg complacently.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``I now propose a toast, as my `friend and pardner, Sairy Gamp', says.
Fun forever, and no grubbing!''  (<font color='red'><b>Jo/Miss Jo/JO</b></font>)</div>cried Jo, rising, glass in hand, as the
lemonade went round.

<p/>They all drank it merrily, and began the experiment by lounging for the
rest of the day. Next morning, Meg did not appear till ten o'clock.
Her (<font color='blue'><b>Meg</b></font>) solitary breakfast did not taste good, and the room seemed lonely
and untidy, for Jo had not filled the vases, Beth had not dusted, and
Amy's books lay scattered about. Nothing was neat and pleasant but
``Marmee's corner', which looked as usual. And there Meg sat, to `rest
and read', which meant to yawn and imagine what pretty summer dresses
she (<font color='blue'><b>Meg</b></font>) would get with her (<font color='blue'><b>Meg</b></font>) salary. Jo spent the morning on the river with
Laurie and the afternoon reading and crying over _The Wide, Wide
World_, up in the apple tree. Beth began by rummaging everything out
of the big closet where her (<font color='blue'><b>Beth</b></font>) family resided, but getting tired before
half done, she (<font color='blue'><b>Beth</b></font>) left her (<font color='blue'><b>Beth</b></font>) establishment topsy-turvy and went to her (<font color='blue'><b>Beth</b></font>)
music, rejoicing that she (<font color='blue'><b>Beth</b></font>) had no dishes to wash. Amy arranged her (<font color='blue'><b>Amy</b></font>)
bower, put on her (<font color='blue'><b>Amy</b></font>) best white frock, smoothed her (<font color='blue'><b>Amy</b></font>) curls, and sat down to
draw under the honeysuckle, hoping someone would see and inquire who
the young artist was. As no one appeared but an inquisitive
daddy-longlegs, who examined her (<font color='blue'><b>Amy</b></font>) work with interest, she (<font color='blue'><b>Amy</b></font>) went to walk,
got caught in a shower, and came home dripping.

<p/>At teatime they compared notes, and all agreed that it had been a
delightful, though unusually long day. Meg, who went shopping in the
afternoon and got a `sweet blue muslin', had discovered, after she (<font color='blue'><b>Meg</b></font>) had
cut the breadths off, that it wouldn't wash, which mishap made her (<font color='blue'><b>Meg</b></font>)
slightly cross. Jo had burned the skin off her (<font color='blue'><b>Jo</b></font>) nose boating, and got a
raging headache by reading too long. Beth was worried by the confusion
of her (<font color='blue'><b>Beth</b></font>) closet and the difficulty of learning three or four songs at
once, and Amy deeply regretted the damage done her (<font color='blue'><b>Amy</b></font>) frock, for Katy
Brown's party was to be the next day and now like Flora McFlimsey, she (<font color='blue'><b>Flora</b></font>)
had `nothing to wear'. But these were mere trifles, and they assured
their mother that the experiment was working finely. She (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) smiled, said
nothing, and with Hannah's help did their neglected work, keeping home
pleasant and the domestic machinery running smoothly. It was
astonishing what a peculiar and uncomfortable state of things was
produced by the `resting and reveling' process. The days kept getting
longer and longer, the weather was unusually variable and so were
tempers; an unsettled feeling possessed everyone, and Satan found
plenty of mischief for the idle hands to do. As the height of luxury,
Meg put out some of her (<font color='blue'><b>Meg</b></font>) sewing, and then found time hang so heavily,
that she (<font color='blue'><b>Meg</b></font>) fell to snipping and spoiling her (<font color='blue'><b>Meg</b></font>) clothes in her (<font color='blue'><b>Meg</b></font>) attempts to
furbish them up a la Moffat. Jo read till her (<font color='blue'><b>Jo</b></font>) eyes gave out and she (<font color='blue'><b>Jo</b></font>)
was sick of books, got so fidgety that even good-natured Laurie had a
quarrel with her (<font color='blue'><b>Jo</b></font>), and so reduced in spirits that she (<font color='blue'><b>Jo</b></font>) desperately wished
she (<font color='blue'><b>Jo</b></font>) had gone with Aunt March. Beth got on pretty well, for she (<font color='blue'><b>Beth</b></font>) was
constantly forgetting that it was to be all play and no work, and fell
back into her (<font color='blue'><b>Beth</b></font>) old ways now and then. But something in the air affected
her (<font color='blue'><b>Beth</b></font>), and more than once her (<font color='blue'><b>Beth</b></font>) tranquility was much disturbed, so much so
that on one occasion she (<font color='blue'><b>Beth</b></font>) actually shook poor dear Joanna and told her (<font color='blue'><b>Beth</b></font>)
she (<font color='blue'><b>Beth</b></font>) was 'a fright'. Amy fared worst of all, for her (<font color='blue'><b>Amy</b></font>) resources were
small, and when her (<font color='blue'><b>Amy</b></font>) sisters left her (<font color='blue'><b>Amy</b></font>) to amuse herself, she (<font color='blue'><b>Amy</b></font>) soon found
that accomplished and important little self a great burden. She (<font color='blue'><b>Amy</b></font>) didn't
like dolls, fairy tales were childish, and one couldn't draw all the
time. Tea parties didn't amount to much, neither did picnics, unless
very well conducted. <div class="bookquote">``If one could have a fine house, full of nice
girls, or go traveling, the summer would be delightful, but to stay at
home with three selfish sisters and a grown-up boy was enough to try
the patience of a Boaz,''  (<font color='red'><b>Miss Malaprop</b></font>)</div>complained Miss Malaprop, after several days
devoted to pleasure, fretting, and ennui.

<p/>No one would own that they were tired of the experiment, but by Friday
night each acknowledged to herself that she (<font color='blue'><b>Malaprop</b></font>) was glad the week was
nearly done. Hoping to impress the lesson more deeply, Mrs. March, who
had a good deal of humor, resolved to finish off the trial in an
appropriate manner, so she (<font color='blue'><b>Malaprop</b></font>) gave Hannah a holiday and let the girls
enjoy the full effect of the play system.

<p/>When they got up on Saturday morning, there was no fire in the kitchen,
no breakfast in the dining room, and no mother anywhere to be seen.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Mercy on us! What has happened?''  (<font color='red'><b>Jo/Miss Jo/JO</b></font>)</div>cried Jo, staring about her (<font color='blue'><b>Jo</b></font>) in
dismay.

<p/>Meg ran upstairs and soon came back again, looking relieved but rather
bewildered, and a little ashamed.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Mother isn't sick, only very tired, and she (<font color='blue'><b>Mother</b></font>) says she (<font color='blue'><b>Mother</b></font>) is going to stay
quietly in her (<font color='blue'><b>Mother</b></font>) room all day and let us do the best we can. It's a very
queer thing for her (<font color='blue'><b>Mother</b></font>) to do, she (<font color='blue'><b>Mother</b></font>) doesn't act a bit like herself. But she (<font color='blue'><b>Mother</b></font>)
says it has been a hard week for her (<font color='blue'><b>Mother</b></font>), so we mustn't grumble but take
care of ourselves.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``That's easy enough, and I like the idea, I'm aching for something to
do, that is, some new amusement, you know,''  (<font color='red'><b>Jo/Miss Jo/JO</b></font>)</div>added Jo quickly.

<p/>In fact it was an immense relief to them all to have a little work, and
they took hold with a will, but soon realized the truth of Hannah's
saying, <div class="bookquote">``Housekeeping ain't no joke.''  (<font color='red'><b>Hannah</b></font>)</div>There was plenty of food in the
larder, and while Beth and Amy set the table, Meg and Jo got breakfast,
wondering as they did why servants ever talked about hard work.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``I shall take some up to Mother, though she (<font color='blue'><b>Mother</b></font>) said we were not to think
of her (<font color='blue'><b>Mother</b></font>), for she (<font color='blue'><b>Mother</b></font>)'d take care of herself,''  (<font color='red'><b>Meg</b></font>)</div>said Meg, who presided and
felt quite matronly behind the teapot.

<p/>So a tray was fitted out before anyone began, and taken up with the
cook's compliments. The boiled tea was very bitter, the omelet
scorched, and the biscuits speckled with saleratus, but Mrs. March
received her (<font color='blue'><b>Meg</b></font>) repast with thanks and laughed heartily over it after Jo
was gone.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Poor little souls, they will have a hard time, I'm afraid, but they
won't suffer, and it will do them good,''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Jo</b></font>) said, producing the more
palatable viands with which she (<font color='blue'><b>Jo</b></font>) had provided herself, and disposing of
the bad breakfast, so that their feelings might not be hurt, a motherly
little deception for which they were grateful.

<p/>Many were the complaints below, and great the chagrin of the head cook
at her (<font color='blue'><b>Jo</b></font>) failures. <div class="bookquote">``Never mind, I'll get the dinner and be servant, you
be mistress, keep your hands nice, see company, and give orders,''  (<font color='red'><b>Jo/Miss Jo/JO</b></font>)</div>said
Jo, who knew still less than Meg about culinary affairs.

<p/>This obliging offer was gladly accepted, and Margaret retired to the
parlor, which she (<font color='blue'><b>Margaret</b></font>) hastily put in order by whisking the litter under the
sofa and shutting the blinds to save the trouble of dusting. Jo, with
perfect faith in her (<font color='blue'><b>Jo</b></font>) own powers and a friendly desire to make up the
quarrel, immediately put a note in the office, inviting Laurie to
dinner.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``You'd better see what you have got before you think of having
company,''  (<font color='red'><b>Meg</b></font>)</div>said Meg, when informed of the hospitable but rash act.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Oh, there's corned beef and plenty of potatoes, and I shall get some
asparagus and a lobster, `for a relish', as Hannah says. We'll have
lettuce and make a salad. I don't know how, but the book tells. I'll
have blanc mange and strawberries for dessert, and coffee too, if you
want to be elegant.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Don't try too many messes, Jo, for you can't make anything but
gingerbread and molasses candy fit to eat. I wash my hands of the
dinner party, and since you have asked Laurie on your own
responsibility, you may just take care of him (<font color='blue'><b>Laurie</b></font>).''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I don't want you to do anything but be civil to him (<font color='blue'><b>Laurie</b></font>) and help to the
pudding. You'll give me your advice if I get in a muddle, won't you?''
 (<font color='red'><b>Jo/Miss Jo/JO</b></font>)</div>asked Jo, rather hurt.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Yes, but I don't know much, except about bread and a few trifles. You
had better ask Mother's leave before you order anything,''  (<font color='red'><b>Meg</b></font>)</div>returned Meg
prudently.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Of course I shall. I'm not a fool.''  (<font color='red'><b>Jo/Miss Jo/JO</b></font>)</div>And Jo went off in a huff at the
doubts expressed of her (<font color='blue'><b>Jo</b></font>) powers.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Get what you like, and don't disturb me. I'm going out to dinner and
can't worry about things at home,''  (<font color='red'><b>Jo/Miss Jo/JO</b></font>)</div>said Mrs. March, when Jo spoke to
her (<font color='blue'><b>Jo</b></font>). <div class="bookquote">``I never enjoyed housekeeping, and I'm going to take a vacation
today, and read, write, go visiting, and amuse myself.''

 (<font color='red'><b>mother</b></font>)</div><p/>The unusual spectacle of her (<font color='blue'><b>Jo</b></font>) busy mother rocking comfortably and
reading early in the morning made Jo feel as if some unnatural
phenomenon had occurred, for an eclipse, an earthquake, or a volcanic
eruption would hardly have seemed stranger.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Everything is out of sorts, somehow,''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Jo</b></font>) said to herself, going
downstairs. <div class="bookquote">``There's Beth crying, that's a sure sign that something is
wrong in this family. If Amy is bothering, I'll shake her (<font color='blue'><b>Amy</b></font>).''

 (<font color='red'><b>Jo/Miss Jo/JO</b></font>)</div><p/>Feeling very much out of sorts herself, Jo hurried into the parlor to
find Beth sobbing over Pip, the canary, who lay dead in the cage with
his (<font color='blue'><b>stranger</b></font>) little claws pathetically extended, as if imploring the food for
want of which he (<font color='blue'><b>stranger</b></font>) had died.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``It's all my fault, I forgot him (<font color='blue'><b>me</b></font>), there isn't a seed or a drop left.
Oh, Pip! Oh, Pip! How could I be so cruel to you?''  (<font color='red'><b>Beth</b></font>)</div>cried Beth, taking
the poor thing in her (<font color='blue'><b>Beth</b></font>) hands and trying to restore him (<font color='blue'><b>stranger</b></font>).

<p/>Jo peeped into his (<font color='blue'><b>stranger</b></font>) half-open eye, felt his (<font color='blue'><b>stranger</b></font>) little heart, and finding
him (<font color='blue'><b>stranger</b></font>) stiff and cold, shook her (<font color='blue'><b>Jo</b></font>) head, and offered her (<font color='blue'><b>Jo</b></font>) domino box for a
coffin.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Put him (<font color='blue'><b>me</b></font>) in the oven, and maybe he (<font color='blue'><b>me</b></font>) will get warm and revive,''  (<font color='red'><b>Amy/Amy March</b></font>)</div>said Amy
hopefully.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``He (<font color='blue'><b>me</b></font>)'s been starved, and he (<font color='blue'><b>me</b></font>) shan't be baked now he (<font color='blue'><b>me</b></font>)'s dead. I'll make
him (<font color='blue'><b>me</b></font>) a shroud, and he (<font color='blue'><b>me</b></font>) shall be buried in the garden, and I'll never have
another bird, never, my Pip! for I am too bad to own one,''  (<font color='red'><b>Beth</b></font>)</div>murmured
Beth, sitting on the floor with her (<font color='blue'><b>Amy</b></font>) pet folded in her (<font color='blue'><b>Amy</b></font>) hands.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``The funeral shall be this afternoon, and we will all go. Now, don't
cry, Bethy. It's a pity, but nothing goes right this week, and Pip has
had the worst of the experiment. Make the shroud, and lay him (<font color='blue'><b>me</b></font>) in my
box, and after the dinner party, we'll have a nice little funeral,''
 (<font color='red'><b>Jo/Miss Jo/JO</b></font>)</div>said Jo, beginning to feel as if she (<font color='blue'><b>Jo</b></font>) had undertaken a good deal.

<p/>Leaving the others to console Beth, she (<font color='blue'><b>Beth</b></font>) departed to the kitchen, which
was in a most discouraging state of confusion. Putting on a big apron,
she (<font color='blue'><b>Beth</b></font>) fell to work and got the dishes piled up ready for washing, when
she (<font color='blue'><b>Beth</b></font>) discovered that the fire was out.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Here's a sweet prospect!''  (<font color='red'><b>Jo/Miss Jo/JO</b></font>)</div>muttered Jo, slamming the stove door open,
and poking vigorously among the cinders.

<p/>Having rekindled the fire, she (<font color='blue'><b>Jo</b></font>) thought she (<font color='blue'><b>Jo</b></font>) would go to market while the
water heated. The walk revived her (<font color='blue'><b>Jo</b></font>) spirits, and flattering herself
that she (<font color='blue'><b>Jo</b></font>) had made good bargains, she (<font color='blue'><b>Jo</b></font>) trudged home again, after buying a
very young lobster, some very old asparagus, and two boxes of acid
strawberries. By the time she (<font color='blue'><b>Jo</b></font>) got cleared up, the dinner arrived and
the stove was red-hot. Hannah had left a pan of bread to rise, Meg had
worked it up early, set it on the hearth for a second rising, and
forgotten it. Meg was entertaining Sallie Gardiner in the parlor, when
the door flew open and a floury, crocky, flushed, and disheveled figure
appeared, demanding tartly...

<p/><div class="bookquote">``I say, isn't bread `riz' enough when it runs over the pans?''

 (<font color='red'><b>Sallie Gardiner</b></font>)</div><p/>Sallie began to laugh, but Meg nodded and lifted her (<font color='blue'><b>Meg</b></font>) eyebrows as high
as they would go, which caused the apparition to vanish and put the
sour bread into the oven without further delay. Mrs. March went out,
after peeping here and there to see how matters went, also saying a
word of comfort to Beth, who sat making a winding sheet, while the dear
departed lay in state in the domino box. A straLanguage cannot describe
nge sense of
helplessness fell upon the girls as the gray bonnet vanished round the
corner, and despair seized them when a few minutes later Miss Crocker
appeared, and said she (<font color='blue'><b>Crocker</b></font>)'d come to dinner. Now this lady was a thin,
yellow spinster, with a sharp nose and inquisitive eyes, who saw
everything and gossiped about all she (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) saw. They disliked her (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>), but had
been taught to be kind to her (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>), simply because she (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) was old and poor and
had few friends. So Meg gave her (<font color='blue'><b>Meg</b></font>) the easy chair and tried to entertain
her (<font color='blue'><b>Meg</b></font>), while she (<font color='blue'><b>Meg</b></font>) asked questions, criticized everything, and told stories
of the people whom she (<font color='blue'><b>Meg</b></font>) knew.

<p/>Language cannot describe the anxieties, experiences, and exertions
which Jo underwent that morning, and the dinner she (<font color='blue'><b>Jo</b></font>) served up became a
standing joke. Fearing to ask any more advice, she (<font color='blue'><b>Jo</b></font>) did her (<font color='blue'><b>Jo</b></font>) best alone,
and discovered that something more than energy and good will is
necessary to make a cook. She (<font color='blue'><b>Jo</b></font>) boiled the asparagus for an hour and was
grieved to find the heads cooked off and the stalks harder than ever.
The bread burned black; for the salad dressing so aggravated her (<font color='blue'><b>Jo</b></font>) that
she (<font color='blue'><b>Jo</b></font>) could not make it fit to eat. The lobster was a scarlet mystery to
her (<font color='blue'><b>Jo</b></font>), but she (<font color='blue'><b>Jo</b></font>) hammered and poked till it was unshelled and its meager
proportions concealed in a grove of lettuce leaves. The potatoes had
to be hurried, not to keep the asparagus waiting, and were not done at
the last. The blanc mange was lumpy, and the strawberries not as ripe
as they looked, having been skilfully `deaconed'.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Well, they can eat beef and bread and butter, if they are hungry, only
it's mortifying to have to spend your whole morning for nothing,''
 (<font color='red'><b>Jo/Miss Jo/JO</b></font>)</div>thought Jo, as she (<font color='blue'><b>Jo</b></font>) rang the bell half an hour later than usual, and
stood, hot, tired, and dispirited, surveying the feast spread before
Laurie, accustomed to all sorts of elegance, and Miss Crocker, whose
tattling tongue would report them far and wide.

<p/>Poor Jo would gladly have gone under the table, as one thing after
another was tasted and left, while Amy giggled, Meg looked distressed,
Miss Crocker pursed her (<font color='blue'><b>Crocker</b></font>) lips, and Laurie talked and laughed with all
his (<font color='blue'><b>Laurie</b></font>) might to give a cheerful tone to the festive scene. Jo's one
strong point was the fruit, for she (<font color='blue'><b>Jo</b></font>) had sugared it well, and had a
pitcher of rich cream to eat with it. Her (<font color='blue'><b>Jo</b></font>) hot cheeks cooled a trifle,
and she (<font color='blue'><b>Jo</b></font>) drew a long breath as the pretty glass plates went round, and
everyone looked graciously at the little rosy islands floating in a sea
of cream. Miss Crocker tasted first, made a wry face, and drank some
water hastily. Jo, who refused, thinking there might not be enough,
for they dwindled sadly after the picking over, glanced at Laurie, but
he (<font color='blue'><b>Laurie</b></font>) was eating away manfully, though there was a slight pucker about his (<font color='blue'><b>Laurie</b></font>)
mouth and he (<font color='blue'><b>Laurie</b></font>) kept his (<font color='blue'><b>Laurie</b></font>) eye fixed on his (<font color='blue'><b>Laurie</b></font>) plate. Amy, who was fond of
delicate fare, took a heaping spoonful, choked, hid her (<font color='blue'><b>Amy</b></font>) face in her (<font color='blue'><b>Amy</b></font>)
napkin, and left the table precipitately.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Oh, what is it?''  (<font color='red'><b>Jo/Miss Jo/JO</b></font>)</div>exclaimed Jo, trembling.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Salt instead of sugar, and the cream is sour,''  (<font color='red'><b>Meg</b></font>)</div>replied Meg with a
tragic gesture.

<p/>Jo uttered a groan and fell back in her (<font color='blue'><b>Jo</b></font>) chair, remembering that she (<font color='blue'><b>Jo</b></font>) had
given a last hasty powdering to the berries out of one of the two boxes
on the kitchen table, and had neglected to put the milk in the
refrigerator. She (<font color='blue'><b>Jo</b></font>) turned scarlet and was on the verge of crying, when
she (<font color='blue'><b>Jo</b></font>) met Laurie's eyes, which would look merry in spite of his (<font color='blue'><b>Laurie</b></font>) heroic
efforts. The comical side of the affair suddenly struck her (<font color='blue'><b>Jo</b></font>), and she (<font color='blue'><b>Jo</b></font>)
laughed till the tears ran down her (<font color='blue'><b>Jo</b></font>) cheeks. So did everyone else, even
``Croaker' as the girls called the old lady, and the unfortunate dinner
ended gaily, with bread and butter, olives and fun.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``I haven't strength of mind enough to clear up now, so we will sober
ourselves with a funeral,''  (<font color='red'><b>Jo/Miss Jo/JO</b></font>)</div>said Jo, as they rose, and Miss Crocker made
ready to go, being eager to tell the new story at another friend's
dinner table.

<p/>They did sober themselves for Beth's sake. Laurie dug a grave under
the ferns in the grove, little Pip was laid in, with many tears by his (<font color='blue'><b>Laurie</b></font>)
tender-hearted mistress, and covered with moss, while a wreath of
violets and chickweed was hung on the stone which bore his (<font color='blue'><b>Laurie</b></font>) epitaph,
composed by Jo while she (<font color='blue'><b>Jo</b></font>) struggled with the dinner.

<p/>Here lies Pip March,
Who died the 7th of June;
Loved and lamented sore,
And not forgotten soon.

<p/>At the conclusion of the ceremonies, Beth retired to her (<font color='blue'><b>Beth</b></font>) room, overcome
with emotion and lobster, but there was no place of repose, for the
beds were not made, and she (<font color='blue'><b>Beth</b></font>) found her (<font color='blue'><b>Beth</b></font>) grief much assuaged by beating up
the pillows and putting things in order. Meg helped Jo clear away the
remains of the feast, which took half the afternoon and left them so
tired that they agreed to be contented with tea and toast for supper.

<p/>Laurie took Amy to drive, which was a deed of charity, for the sour
cream seemed to have had a bad effect upon her (<font color='blue'><b>Amy</b></font>) temper. Mrs. March came
home to find the three older girls hard at work in the middle of the
afternoon, and a glance at the closet gave her (<font color='blue'><b>Amy</b></font>) an idea of the success
of one part of the experiment.

<p/>Before the housewives could rest, several people called, and there was
a scramble to get ready to see them. Then tea must be got, errands
done, and one or two necessary bits of sewing neglected until the last
minute. As twilight fell, dewy and still, one by one they gathered on
the porch where the June roses were budding beautifully, and each
groaned or sighed as she (<font color='blue'><b>Amy</b></font>) sat down, as if tired or troubled.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``What a dreadful day this has been!''  (<font color='red'><b>Jo/Miss Jo/JO</b></font>)</div>began Jo, usually the first to
speak.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``It has seemed shorter than usual, but so uncomfortable,''  (<font color='red'><b>Meg</b></font>)</div>said Meg.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Not a bit like home,''  (<font color='red'><b>Amy/Amy March</b></font>)</div>added Amy.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``It can't seem so without Marmee and little Pip,''  (<font color='red'><b>Beth</b></font>)</div>sighed Beth, glancing
with full eyes at the empty cage above her (<font color='blue'><b>Beth</b></font>) head.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Here's Mother, dear, and you shall have another bird tomorrow, if you
want it.''

 (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div><p/>As she (<font color='blue'><b>Beth</b></font>) spoke, Mrs. March came and took her (<font color='blue'><b>Beth</b></font>) place among them, looking as
if her (<font color='blue'><b>Beth</b></font>) holiday had not been much pleasanter than theirs.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Are you satisfied with your experiment, girls, or do you want another
week of it?''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Beth</b></font>) asked, as Beth nestled up to her (<font color='blue'><b>Beth</b></font>) and the rest turned
toward her (<font color='blue'><b>Beth</b></font>) with brightening faces, as flowers turn toward the sun.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``I don't!''  (<font color='red'><b>Jo/Miss Jo/JO</b></font>)</div>cried Jo decidedly.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Nor I,''  (<font color='red'><b>the others</b></font>)</div>echoed the others.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``You think then, that it is better to have a few duties and live a
little for others, do you?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Lounging and larking doesn't pay,''  (<font color='red'><b>Jo/Miss Jo/JO</b></font>)</div>observed Jo, shaking her (<font color='blue'><b>Jo</b></font>) head. <div class="bookquote">``I'm
tired of it and mean to go to work at something right off.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Suppose you learn plain cooking. That's a useful accomplishment,
which no woman should be without,''  (<font color='red'><b>Jo/Miss Jo/JO</b></font>)</div>said Mrs. March, laughing inaudibly
at the recollection of Jo's dinner party, for she (<font color='blue'><b>Jo</b></font>) had met Miss Crocker
and heard her (<font color='blue'><b>Jo</b></font>) account of it.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Mother, did you go away and let everything be, just to see how we'd
get on?''  (<font color='red'><b>Meg</b></font>)</div>cried Meg, who had had suspicions all day.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Yes, I wanted you to see how the comfort of all depends on each doing
her (<font color='blue'><b>Mother</b></font>) share faithfully. While Hannah and I did your work, you got on
pretty well, though I don't think you were very happy or amiable. So I
thought, as a little lesson, I would show you what happens when
everyone thinks only of herself. Don't you feel that it is pleasanter
to help one another, to have daily duties which make leisure sweet when
it comes, and to bear and forbear, that home may be comfortable and
lovely to us all?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``We do, Mother, we do!''  (<font color='red'><b>the girls</b></font>)</div>cried the girls.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Then let me advise you to take up your little burdens again, for
though they seem heavy sometimes, they are good for us, and lighten as
we learn to carry them. Work is wholesome, and there is plenty for
everyone. It keeps us from ennui and mischief, is good for health and
spirits, and gives us a sense of power and independence better than
money or fashion.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``We'll work like bees, and love it too, see if we don't,''  (<font color='red'><b>Jo/Miss Jo/JO</b></font>)</div>said Jo.
<div class="bookquote">``I'll learn plain cooking for my holiday task, and the next dinner
party I have shall be a success.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I'll make the set of shirts for father, instead of letting you do it,
Marmee. I can and I will, though I'm not fond of sewing. That will be
better than fussing over my own things, which are plenty nice enough as
they are.''  (<font color='red'><b>Meg</b></font>)</div>said Meg.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``I'll do my lessons every day, and not spend so much time with my music
and dolls. I am a stupid thing, and ought to be studying, not
playing,''  (<font color='red'><b>Beth</b></font>)</div>was Beth's resolution, while Amy followed their example by
heroically declaring, <div class="bookquote">``I shall learn to make buttonholes, and attend to
my parts of speech.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Amy/Amy March</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Very good! Then I am quite satisfied with the experiment, and fancy
that we shall not have to repeat it, only don't go to the other extreme
and delve like slaves. Have regular hours for work and play, make each
day both useful and pleasant, and prove that you understand the worth
of time by employing it well. Then youth will be delightful, old age
will bring few regrets, and life become a beautiful success, in spite
of poverty.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``We'll remember, Mother!''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>and they did.



<p/>CHAPTER TWELVE

<p/>CAMP LAURENCE

<p/>Beth was postmistress, for, being most at home, she (<font color='blue'><b>Beth</b></font>) could attend to it
regularly, and dearly liked the daily task of unlocking the little door
and distributing the mail. One July day she (<font color='blue'><b>Beth</b></font>) came in with her (<font color='blue'><b>Beth</b></font>) hands
full, and went about the house leaving letters and parcels like the
penny post.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Here's your posy, Mother! Laurie never forgets that,''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Beth</b></font>) said,
putting the fresh nosegay in the vase that stood in ``Marmee's corner',
and was kept supplied by the affectionate boy.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Miss Meg March, one letter and a glove,''  (<font color='red'><b>Beth</b></font>)</div>continued Beth, delivering
the articles to her (<font color='blue'><b>Beth</b></font>) sister, who sat near her (<font color='blue'><b>Beth</b></font>) mother, stitching
wristbands.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Why, I left a pair over there, and here is only one,''  (<font color='red'><b>Meg</b></font>)</div>said Meg,
looking at the gray cotton glove. <div class="bookquote">``Didn't you drop the other in the
garden?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``No, I'm sure I didn't, for there was only one in the office.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I hate to have odd gloves! Never mind, the other may be found. My
letter is only a translation of the German song I wanted. I think Mr.
Brooke did it, for this isn't Laurie's writing.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Meg</b></font>)</div><p/>Mrs. March glanced at Meg, who was looking very pretty in her (<font color='blue'><b>Meg</b></font>) gingham
morning gown, with the little curls blowing about her (<font color='blue'><b>Meg</b></font>) forehead, and
very womanly, as she (<font color='blue'><b>Meg</b></font>) sat sewing at her (<font color='blue'><b>Meg</b></font>) little worktable, full of tidy
white rolls, so unconscious of the thought in her (<font color='blue'><b>Meg</b></font>) mother's mind as she (<font color='blue'><b>Meg</b></font>)
sewed and sang, while her (<font color='blue'><b>Meg</b></font>) fingers flew and her (<font color='blue'><b>Meg</b></font>) thoughts were busied
with girlish fancies as innocent and fresh as the pansies in her (<font color='blue'><b>Meg</b></font>) belt,
that Mrs. March smiled and was satisfied.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Two letters for Doctor Jo, a book, and a funny old hat, which covered
the whole post office and stuck outside,''  (<font color='red'><b>Beth</b></font>)</div>said Beth, laughing as she (<font color='blue'><b>Beth</b></font>)
went into the study where Jo sat writing.

<p/>``What a sly fellow Laurie is! I said I wished bigger hats were the
fashion, because I burn my face every hot day. He (<font color='blue'><b>Laurie</b></font>) said, ``Why mind the
fashion? Wear a big hat, and be comfortable!<div class="bookquote">'' I said I would if I had
one, and he (<font color='blue'><b>Meg</b></font>) has sent me this, to try me. I'll wear it for fun, and
show him (<font color='blue'><b>Meg</b></font>) I don't care for the fashion.''  (<font color='red'><b>Plato</b></font>)</div>And hanging the antique
broad-brim on a bust of Plato, Jo read her (<font color='blue'><b>Jo</b></font>) letters.

<p/>One from her (<font color='blue'><b>Jo</b></font>) mother made her (<font color='blue'><b>Jo</b></font>) cheeks glow and her (<font color='blue'><b>Jo</b></font>) eyes fill, for it said
to her (<font color='blue'><b>Jo</b></font>)...


<p/>My Dear:

<p/>I write a little word to tell you with how much satisfaction I watch
your efforts to control your temper. You say nothing about your
trials, failures, or successes, and think, perhaps, that no one sees
them but the Friend whose help you daily ask, if I may trust the
well-worn cover of your guidebook. I, too, have seen them all, and
heartily believe in the sincerity of your resolution, since it begins
to bear fruit. Go on, dear, patiently and bravely, and always believe
that no one sympathizes more tenderly with you than your loving...

<p/>Mother


<p/><div class="bookquote">``That does me good! That's worth millions of money and pecks of
praise. Oh, Marmee, I do try! I will keep on trying, and not get
tired, since I have you to help me.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Mother</b></font>)</div><p/>Laying her (<font color='blue'><b>Mother</b></font>) head on her (<font color='blue'><b>Mother</b></font>) arms, Jo wet her (<font color='blue'><b>Jo</b></font>) little romance with a few happy
tears, for she (<font color='blue'><b>Jo</b></font>) had thought that no one saw and appreciated her (<font color='blue'><b>Jo</b></font>) efforts
to be good, and this assurance was doubly precious, doubly encouraging,
because unexpected and from the person whose commendation she (<font color='blue'><b>Jo</b></font>) most
valued. Feeling stronger than ever to meet and subdue her (<font color='blue'><b>Jo</b></font>) Apollyon,
she (<font color='blue'><b>Jo</b></font>) pinned the note inside her (<font color='blue'><b>Jo</b></font>) frock, as a shield and a reminder, lest
she (<font color='blue'><b>Jo</b></font>) be taken unaware, and proceeded to open her (<font color='blue'><b>Jo</b></font>) other letter, quite
ready for either good or bad news. In a big, dashing hand, Laurie
wrote...

<p/>Dear Jo, What ho!

<p/>Some English girls and boys are coming to see me tomorrow and I want to
have a jolly time. If it's fine, I'm going to pitch my tent in
Longmeadow, and row up the whole crew to lunch and croquet--have a
fire, make messes, gypsy fashion, and all sorts of larks. They are
nice people, and like such things. Brooke will go to keep us boys
steady, and Kate Vaughn will play propriety for the girls. I want you
all to come, can't let Beth off at any price, and nobody shall worry
her (<font color='blue'><b>Beth</b></font>). Don't bother about rations, I'll see to that and everything else,
only do come, there's a good fellow!

<p/>In a tearing hurry, Yours ever, Laurie.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Here's richness!''  (<font color='red'><b>Jo/Miss Jo/JO</b></font>)</div>cried Jo, flying in to tell the news to Meg.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Of course we can go, Mother? It will be such a help to Laurie, for I
can row, and Meg see to the lunch, and the children be useful in some
way.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I hope the Vaughns are not fine grown-up people. Do you know anything
about them, Jo?''  (<font color='red'><b>Meg</b></font>)</div>asked Meg.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Only that there are four of them. Kate is older than you, Fred and
Frank -LRB-twins-RRB- about my age, and a little girl -LRB-Grace-RRB-, who is nine or
ten. Laurie knew them abroad, and liked the boys. I fancied, from the
way he (<font color='blue'><b>Laurie</b></font>) primmed up his (<font color='blue'><b>Laurie</b></font>) mouth in speaking of her (<font color='blue'><b>Grace</b></font>), that he (<font color='blue'><b>Laurie</b></font>) didn't admire
Kate much.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I'm so glad my French print is clean, it's just the thing and so
becoming!''  (<font color='red'><b>Meg</b></font>)</div>observed Meg complacently. <div class="bookquote">``Have you anything decent, Jo?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Scarlet and gray boating suit, good enough for me. I shall row and
tramp about, so I don't want any starch to think of. You'll come,
Betty?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``If you won't let any boys talk to me.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Not a boy!''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I like to please Laurie, and I'm not afraid of Mr. Brooke, he (<font color='blue'><b>Brooke</b></font>) is so
kind. But I don't want to play, or sing, or say anything. I'll work
hard and not trouble anyone, and you'll take care of me, Jo, so I'll
go.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``That's my good girl. You do try to fight off your shyness, and I love
you for it. Fighting faults isn't easy, as I know, and a cheery word
kind of gives a lift. Thank you, Mother,''  (<font color='red'><b>Jo/Miss Jo/JO</b></font>)</div>And Jo gave the thin cheek a
grateful kiss, more precious to Mrs. March than if it had given back
the rosy roundness of her (<font color='blue'><b>Jo</b></font>) youth.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``I had a box of chocolate drops, and the picture I wanted to copy,''
 (<font color='red'><b>Amy/Amy March</b></font>)</div>said Amy, showing her (<font color='blue'><b>Amy</b></font>) mail.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``And I got a note from Mr. Laurence, asking me to come over and play to
him (<font color='blue'><b>Laurence</b></font>) tonight, before the lamps are lighted, and I shall go,''  (<font color='red'><b>Beth</b></font>)</div>added Beth,
whose friendship with the old gentleman prospered finely.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Now let's fly round, and do double duty today, so that we can play
tomorrow with free minds,''  (<font color='red'><b>Jo/Miss Jo/JO</b></font>)</div>said Jo, preparing to replace her (<font color='blue'><b>Jo</b></font>) pen with a
broom.

<p/>When the sun peeped into the girls' room early next morning to promise
them a fine day, he (<font color='blue'><b>gentleman</b></font>) saw a comical sight. Each had made such
preparation for the fete as seemed necessary and proper. Meg had an
extra row of little curlpapers across her (<font color='blue'><b>Meg</b></font>) forehead, Jo had copiously
anointed her (<font color='blue'><b>Jo</b></font>) afflicted face with cold cream, Beth had taken Joanna to
bed with her (<font color='blue'><b>Beth</b></font>) to atone for the approaching separation, and Amy had
capped the climax by putting a clothespin on her (<font color='blue'><b>Amy</b></font>) nose to uplift the
offending feature. It was one of the kind artists use to hold the
paper on their drawing boards, therefore quite appropriate and
effective for the purpose it was now being put. This funny spectacle
appeared to amuse the sun, for he (<font color='blue'><b>Jo</b></font>) burst out with such radiance that Jo
woke up and roused her (<font color='blue'><b>Jo</b></font>) sisters by a hearty laugh at Amy's ornament.

<p/>Sunshine and laughter were good omens for a pleasure party, and soon a
lively bustle began in both houses. Beth, who was ready first, kept
reporting what went on next door, and enlivened her (<font color='blue'><b>Beth</b></font>) sisters' toilets by
frequent telegrams from the window.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``There goes the man with the tent! I see Mrs. Barker doing up the
lunch in a hamper and a great basket. Now Mr. Laurence is looking up
at the sky and the weathercock. I wish he (<font color='blue'><b>Laurence</b></font>) would go too. There's
Laurie, looking like a sailor, nice boy! Oh, mercy me! Here's a
carriage full of people, a tall lady, a little girl, and two dreadful
boys. One is lame, poor thing, he (<font color='blue'><b>Laurie</b></font>)'s got a crutch. Laurie didn't tell
us that. Be quick, girls! It's getting late. Why, there is Ned
Moffat, I do declare. Meg, isn't that the man who bowed to you one day
when we were shopping?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``So it is. How queer that he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) should come. I thought he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) was at the
mountains. There is Sallie. I'm glad she (<font color='blue'><b>Sallie</b></font>) got back in time. Am I all
right, Jo?''  (<font color='red'><b>Meg</b></font>)</div>cried Meg in a flutter.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``A regular daisy. Hold up your dress and put your hat on straight, it
looks sentimental tipped that way and will fly off at the first puff.
Now then, come on!''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Oh, Jo, you are not going to wear that awful hat? It's too absurd!
You shall not make a guy of yourself,''  (<font color='red'><b>Meg</b></font>)</div>remonstrated Meg, as Jo tied
down with a red ribbon the broad-brimmed, old-fashioned leghorn Laurie
had sent for a joke.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``I just will, though, for it's capital, so shady, light, and big. It
will make fun, and I don't mind being a guy if I'm comfortable.''  (<font color='red'><b>Jo/Miss Jo/JO</b></font>)</div>With
that Jo marched straight away and the rest followed, a bright little
band of sisters, all looking their best in summer suits, with happy
faces under the jaunty hatbrims.

<p/>Laurie ran to meet and present them to his (<font color='blue'><b>Laurie</b></font>) friends in the most cordial
manner. The lawn was the reception room, and for several minutes a
lively scene was enacted there. Meg was grateful to see that Miss
Kate, though twenty, was dressed with a simplicity which American girls
would do well to imitate, and who was much flattered by Mr. Ned's
assurances that he (<font color='blue'><b>Ned</b></font>) came especially to see her (<font color='blue'><b>Meg</b></font>). Jo understood why
Laurie `primmed up his (<font color='blue'><b>Laurie</b></font>) mouth' when speaking of Kate, for that young
lady had a standoff-don`t-touch-me air, which contrasted strongly with
the free and easy demeanor of the other girls. Beth took an
observation of the new boys and decided that the lame one was not
`dreadful', but gentle and feeble, and she (<font color='blue'><b>Beth</b></font>) would be kind to him (<font color='blue'><b>Laurie</b></font>) on that
account. Amy found Grace a well-mannered, merry, little person, and
after staring dumbly at one another for a few minutes, they suddenly
became very good friends.

<p/>Tents, lunch, and croquet utensils having been sent on beforehand, the
party was soon embarked, and the two boats pushed off together, leaving
Mr. Laurence waving his (<font color='blue'><b>Laurence</b></font>) hat on the shore. Laurie and Jo rowed one
boat, Mr. Brooke and Ned the other, while Fred Vaughn, the riotous
twin, did his (<font color='blue'><b>Vaughn</b></font>) best to upset both by paddling about in a wherry like a
disturbed water bug. Jo's funny hat deserved a vote of thanks, for it
was of general utility. It broke the ice in the beginning by producing
a laugh, it created quite a refreshing breeze, flapping to and fro as
she (<font color='blue'><b>Jo</b></font>) rowed, and would make an excellent umbrella for the whole party, if
a shower came up, she (<font color='blue'><b>Jo</b></font>) said. Miss Kate decided that she (<font color='blue'><b>Kate</b></font>) was `odd', but
rather clever, and smiled upon her (<font color='blue'><b>Kate</b></font>) from afar.

<p/>Meg, in the other boat, was delightfully situated, face to face with
the rowers, who both admired the prospect and feathered their oars with
uncommon `skill and dexterity'. Mr. Brooke was a grave, silent young
man, with handsome brown eyes and a pleasant voice. Meg liked his (<font color='blue'><b>Brooke</b></font>)
quiet manners and considered him (<font color='blue'><b>Brooke</b></font>) a walking encyclopedia of useful
knowledge. He (<font color='blue'><b>Brooke</b></font>) never talked to her (<font color='blue'><b>Meg</b></font>) much, but he (<font color='blue'><b>Brooke</b></font>) looked at her (<font color='blue'><b>Meg</b></font>) a good
deal, and she (<font color='blue'><b>Meg</b></font>) felt sure that he (<font color='blue'><b>Brooke</b></font>) did not regard her (<font color='blue'><b>Meg</b></font>) with aversion. Ned,
being in college, of course put on all the airs which freshmen think it
their bounden duty to assume. He (<font color='blue'><b>Ned</b></font>) was not very wise, but very
good-natured, and altogether an excellent person to carry on a picnic.
Sallie Gardiner was absorbed in keeping her (<font color='blue'><b>Meg</b></font>) white pique dress clean and
chattering with the ubiquitous Fred, who kept Beth in constant terror
by his (<font color='blue'><b>Fred</b></font>) pranks.

<p/>It was not far to Longmeadow, but the tent was pitched and the wickets
down by the time they arrived. A pleasant green field, with three
wide-spreading oaks in the middle and a smooth strip of turf for
croquet.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Welcome to Camp Laurence!''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>said the young host, as they landed with
exclamations of delight.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Brooke is commander in chief, I am commissary general, the other
fellows are staff officers, and you, ladies, are company. The tent is
for your especial benefit and that oak is your drawing room, this is
the messroom and the third is the camp kitchen. Now, let's have a game
before it gets hot, and then we'll see about dinner.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Frank</b></font>)</div><p/>Frank, Beth, Amy, and Grace sat down to watch the game played by the
other eight. Mr. Brooke chose Meg, Kate, and Fred. Laurie took Sallie,
Jo, and Ned. The English played well, but the Americans played better,
and contested every inch of the ground as strongly as if the spirit of
'76 inspired them. Jo and Fred had several skirmishes and once
narrowly escaped high words. Jo was through the last wicket and had
missed the stroke, which failure ruffled her (<font color='blue'><b>Jo</b></font>) a good deal. Fred was
close behind her (<font color='blue'><b>Jo</b></font>) and his (<font color='blue'><b>Fred</b></font>) turn came before hers. He (<font color='blue'><b>Fred</b></font>) gave a stroke, his (<font color='blue'><b>Fred</b></font>)
ball hit the wicket, and stopped an inch on the wrong side. No one was
very near, and running up to examine, he (<font color='blue'><b>Fred</b></font>) gave it a sly nudge with his (<font color='blue'><b>Fred</b></font>)
toe, which put it just an inch on the right side.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``I'm through! Now, Miss Jo, I'll settle you, and get in first,''  (<font color='red'><b>the gentleman</b></font>)</div>cried
the young gentleman, swinging his (<font color='blue'><b>gentleman</b></font>) mallet for another blow.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``You pushed it. I saw you. It's my turn now,''  (<font color='red'><b>Jo/Miss Jo/JO</b></font>)</div>said Jo sharply.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Upon my word, I didn't move it. It rolled a bit, perhaps, but that is
allowed. So, stand off please, and let me have a go at the stake.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``We don't cheat in America, but you can, if you choose,''  (<font color='red'><b>Jo/Miss Jo/JO</b></font>)</div>said Jo
angrily.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Yankees are a deal the most tricky, everybody knows. There you go!''
 (<font color='red'><b>Fred/Fred Vaughn</b></font>)</div>returned Fred, croqueting her (<font color='blue'><b>Jo</b></font>) ball far away.

<p/>Jo opened her (<font color='blue'><b>Jo</b></font>) lips to say something rude, but checked herself in time,
colored up to her (<font color='blue'><b>Jo</b></font>) forehead and stood a minute, hammering down a wicket
with all her (<font color='blue'><b>Jo</b></font>) might, while Fred hit the stake and declared himself out
with much exultation. She (<font color='blue'><b>Jo</b></font>) went off to get her (<font color='blue'><b>Jo</b></font>) ball, and was a long
time finding it among the bushes, but she (<font color='blue'><b>Jo</b></font>) came back, looking cool and
quiet, and waited her (<font color='blue'><b>Jo</b></font>) turn patiently. It took several strokes to
regain the place she (<font color='blue'><b>Jo</b></font>) had lost, and when she (<font color='blue'><b>Jo</b></font>) got there, the other side
had nearly won, for Kate's ball was the last but one and lay near the
stake.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``By George, it's all up with us! Goodbye, Kate. Miss Jo owes me one,
so you are finished,''  (<font color='red'><b>Fred/Fred Vaughn</b></font>)</div>cried Fred excitedly, as they all drew near to
see the finish.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Yankees have a trick of being generous to their enemies,''  (<font color='red'><b>Jo/Miss Jo/JO</b></font>)</div>said Jo,
with a look that made the lad redden, <div class="bookquote">``especially when they beat them,''
 (<font color='red'><b>lad</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Jo</b></font>) added, as, leaving Kate's ball untouched, she (<font color='blue'><b>Kate</b></font>) won the game by a
clever stroke.

<p/>Laurie threw up his (<font color='blue'><b>Laurie</b></font>) hat, then remembered that it wouldn't do to exult
over the defeat of his (<font color='blue'><b>Laurie</b></font>) guests, and stopped in the middle of the cheer
to whisper to his (<font color='blue'><b>Laurie</b></font>) friend, <div class="bookquote">``Good for you, Jo! He (<font color='blue'><b>George</b></font>) did cheat, I saw him (<font color='blue'><b>George</b></font>).
We can't tell him (<font color='blue'><b>George</b></font>) so, but he (<font color='blue'><b>George</b></font>) won't do it again, take my word for it.''

 (<font color='red'><b>friend</b></font>)</div><p/>Meg drew her (<font color='blue'><b>Meg</b></font>) aside, under pretense of pinning up a loose braid, and
said approvingly, <div class="bookquote">``It was dreadfully provoking, but you kept your
temper, and I'm so glad, Jo.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Meg</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Don't praise me, Meg, for I could box his (<font color='blue'><b>George</b></font>) ears this minute. I should
certainly have boiled over if I hadn't stayed among the nettles till I
got my rage under control enough to hold my tongue. It's simmering now,
so I hope he (<font color='blue'><b>George</b></font>)'ll keep out of my way,''  (<font color='red'><b>Jo/Miss Jo/JO</b></font>)</div>returned Jo, biting her (<font color='blue'><b>Jo</b></font>) lips as
she (<font color='blue'><b>Jo</b></font>) glowered at Fred from under her (<font color='blue'><b>Jo</b></font>) big hat.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Time for lunch,''  (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Brooke/Brooke</b></font>)</div>said Mr. Brooke, looking at his (<font color='blue'><b>Brooke</b></font>) watch. <div class="bookquote">``Commissary
general, will you make the fire and get water, while Miss March, Miss
Sallie, and I spread the table? Who can make good coffee?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Jo can,''  (<font color='red'><b>Meg</b></font>)</div>said Meg, glad to recommend her (<font color='blue'><b>Meg</b></font>) sister. So Jo, feeling that
her (<font color='blue'><b>Jo</b></font>) late lessons in cookery were to do her (<font color='blue'><b>Jo</b></font>) honor, went to preside over
the coffeepot, while the children collected dry sticks, and the boys
made a fire and got water from a spring near by. Miss Kate sketched
and Frank talked to Beth, who was making little mats of braided rushes
to serve as plates.

<p/>The commander in chief and his (<font color='blue'><b>commander</b></font>) aides soon spread the tablecloth with an
inviting array of eatables and drinkables, prettily decorated with
green leaves. Jo announced that the coffee was ready, and everyone
settled themselves to a hearty meal, for youth is seldom dyspeptic, and
exercise develops wholesome appetites. A very merry lunch it was, for
everything seemed fresh and funny, and frequent peals of laughter
startled a venerable horse who fed near by. There was a pleasing
inequality in the table, which produced many mishaps to cups and
plates, acorns dropped in the milk, little black ants partook of the
refreshments without being invited, and fuzzy caterpillars swung down
from the tree to see what was going on. Three white-headed children
peeped over the fence, and an objectionable dog barked at them from the
other side of the river with all his (<font color='blue'><b>children</b></font>) might and main.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``There's salt here,''  (<font color='red'><b>Laurie/Mr. Laurie/LAURIE</b></font>)</div>said Laurie, as he (<font color='blue'><b>Laurie</b></font>) handed Jo a saucer of berries.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Thank you, I prefer spiders,''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Jo</b></font>) replied, fishing up two unwary
little ones who had gone to a creamy death. <div class="bookquote">``How dare you remind me of
that horrid dinner party, when yours is so nice in every way?''  (<font color='red'><b>Jo/Miss Jo/JO</b></font>)</div>added
Jo, as they both laughed and ate out of one plate, the china having run
short.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``I had an uncommonly good time that day, and haven't got over it yet.
This is no credit to me, you know, I don't do anything. It's you and
Meg and Brooke who make it all go, and I'm no end obliged to you. What
shall we do when we can't eat anymore?''  (<font color='red'><b>Laurie/Mr. Laurie/LAURIE</b></font>)</div>asked Laurie, feeling that his (<font color='blue'><b>Laurie</b></font>)
trump card had been played when lunch was over.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Have games till it's cooler. I brought Authors, and I dare say Miss
Kate knows something new and nice. Go and ask her (<font color='blue'><b>Kate</b></font>). She (<font color='blue'><b>Kate</b></font>)'s company, and
you ought to stay with her (<font color='blue'><b>Kate</b></font>) more.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Aren't you company too? I thought she (<font color='blue'><b>Kate</b></font>)'d suit Brooke, but he (<font color='blue'><b>Brooke</b></font>) keeps
talking to Meg, and Kate just stares at them through that ridiculous
glass of hers. I'm going, so you needn't try to preach propriety, for
you can't do it, Jo.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Miss Kate/Kate</b></font>)</div><p/>Miss Kate did know several new games, and as the girls would not, and
the boys could not, eat any more, they all adjourned to the drawing
room to play Rig-marole.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``One person begins a story, any nonsense you like, and tells as long as
he (<font color='blue'><b>Brooke</b></font>) pleases, only taking care to stop short at some exciting point, when

done, and makes a perfect jumble of tragical comical stuff to laugh
over. Please start it, Mr. Brooke,''  (<font color='red'><b>Kate/Kate Kearney</b></font>)</div>said Kate, with a commanding air,
which surprised Meg, who treated the tutor with as much respect as any
other gentleman.

<p/>Lying on the grass at the feet of the two young ladies, Mr. Brooke
obediently began the story, with the handsome brown eyes steadily fixed
upon the sunshiny river.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Once on a time, a knight went out into the world to seek his (<font color='blue'><b>knight</b></font>) fortune,
for he (<font color='blue'><b>knight</b></font>) had nothing but his (<font color='blue'><b>knight</b></font>) sword and his (<font color='blue'><b>knight</b></font>) shield. He (<font color='blue'><b>knight</b></font>) traveled a long
while, nearly eight-and-twenty years, and had a hard time of it, till
he (<font color='blue'><b>knight</b></font>) came to the palace of a good old king, who had offered a reward to
anyone who could tame and train a fine but unbroken colt, of which he (<font color='blue'><b>colt</b></font>)
was very fond. The knight agreed to try, and got on slowly but surely,
for the colt was a gallant fellow, and soon learned to love his (<font color='blue'><b>fellow</b></font>) new
master, though he (<font color='blue'><b>fellow</b></font>) was freakish and wild. Every day, when he (<font color='blue'><b>fellow</b></font>) gave his (<font color='blue'><b>fellow</b></font>)
lessons to this pet of the king's, the knight rode him (<font color='blue'><b>knight</b></font>) through the
city, and as he (<font color='blue'><b>knight</b></font>) rode, he (<font color='blue'><b>knight</b></font>) looked everywhere for a certain beautiful
face, which he (<font color='blue'><b>knight</b></font>) had seen many times in his (<font color='blue'><b>knight</b></font>) dreams, but never found. One
day, as he (<font color='blue'><b>knight</b></font>) went prancing down a quiet street, he (<font color='blue'><b>knight</b></font>) saw at the window of a
ruinous castle the lovely face. He (<font color='blue'><b>knight</b></font>) was delighted, inquired who lived
in this old castle, and was told that several captive princesses were
kept there by a spell, and spun all day to lay up money to buy their
liberty. The knight wished intensely that he (<font color='blue'><b>knight</b></font>) could free them, but he (<font color='blue'><b>knight</b></font>)
was poor and could only go by each day, watching for the sweet face and
longing to see it out in the sunshine. At last he (<font color='blue'><b>knight</b></font>) resolved to get into
the castle and ask how he (<font color='blue'><b>knight</b></font>) could help them. He (<font color='blue'><b>knight</b></font>) went and knocked. The

admired the style. '' (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>`Tis she (<font color='blue'><b>Kate</b></font>)!'' cried Count Gustave, and fell at her (<font color='blue'><b>Kate</b></font>)
feet in an ecstasy of joy. ``Oh, rise!'' she (<font color='blue'><b>Kate</b></font>) said, extending a hand of
marble fairness. ``Never! Till you tell me how I may rescue you,'' swore
the knight, still kneeling. ``Alas, my cruel fate condemns me to remain
here till my tyrant is destroyed.'' ``Where is the villain?'' ``In the
mauve salon. Go, brave heart, and save me from despair.'' ``I obey, and
return victorious or dead!<div class="bookquote">'' With these thrilling words he (<font color='blue'><b>knight</b></font>) rushed away,

join the lady, victorious, but with a bump on his (<font color='blue'><b>tyrant</b></font>) brow, found the door

the ladder broke, and he (<font color='blue'><b>tyrant</b></font>) went headfirst into the moat, sixty feet
below. Could swim like a duck, paddled round the castle till he (<font color='blue'><b>tyrant</b></font>) came
to a little door guarded by two stout fellows, knocked their heads

your fist, and spiders that would frighten you into hysterics, Miss

with a flag black as ink flying from her (<font color='blue'><b>Jo</b></font>) foremast. ``Go in and win, my

The Portuguese held his (<font color='blue'><b>captain</b></font>) tongue like a brick, and walked the plank,
while the jolly tars cheered like mad. But the sly dog dived, came up

the knights revived at once, thanked her (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>), and went on their way
rejoicing, never knowing the difference, for there were so many other
heads like them in the world that no one thought anything of it. The
knight in whom I'm interested went back to find the pretty face, and
learned that the princesses had spun themselves free and all gone and
married, but one. He (<font color='blue'><b>knight</b></font>) was in a great state of mind at that, and
mounting the colt, who stood by him (<font color='blue'><b>knight</b></font>) through thick and thin, rushed to
the castle to see which was left. Peeping over the hedge, he (<font color='blue'><b>knight</b></font>) saw the
queen of his (<font color='blue'><b>knight</b></font>) affections picking flowers in her (<font color='blue'><b>queen</b></font>) garden. <div class="bookquote">``Will you give
me a rose?''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>said he (<font color='blue'><b>knight</b></font>). <div class="bookquote">``You must come and get it. I can't come to you,

the hedge, but it seemed to grow higher and higher. Then he (<font color='blue'><b>knight</b></font>) tried to
push through, but it grew thicker and thicker, and he (<font color='blue'><b>knight</b></font>) was in despair.
So he (<font color='blue'><b>knight</b></font>) patiently broke twig after twig till he (<font color='blue'><b>knight</b></font>) had made a little hole
through which he (<font color='blue'><b>knight</b></font>) peeped, saying imploringly, <div class="bookquote">``Let me in! Let me in!''
 (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>But the pretty princess did not seem to understand, for she (<font color='blue'><b>princess</b></font>) picked her (<font color='blue'><b>princess</b></font>)
roses quietly, and left him (<font color='blue'><b>knight</b></font>) to fight his (<font color='blue'><b>knight</b></font>) way in. Whether he (<font color='blue'><b>knight</b></font>) did or
not, Frank will tell you.''

<p/><div class="bookquote">``I can't. I'm not playing, I never do,''  (<font color='red'><b>Frank</b></font>)</div>said Frank, dismayed at the
sentimental predicament out of which he (<font color='blue'><b>Frank</b></font>) was to rescue the absurd
couple. Beth had disappeared behind Jo, and Grace was asleep.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``So the poor knight is to be left sticking in the hedge, is he (<font color='blue'><b>knight</b></font>)?''  (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Brooke/Brooke</b></font>)</div>asked
Mr. Brooke, still watching the river, and playing with the wild rose in
his (<font color='blue'><b>Brooke</b></font>) buttonhole.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Who are your heroes?''  (<font color='red'><b>Jo/Miss Jo/JO</b></font>)</div>asked Jo.

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``What silly questions you ask!''  (<font color='red'><b>Jo/Miss Jo/JO</b></font>)</div>And Jo gave a disdainful shrug as the

<p/><div class="bookquote">``It's a very good one for you,''  (<font color='red'><b>Jo/Miss Jo/JO</b></font>)</div>retorted Jo in a low voice. Her (<font color='blue'><b>Jo</b></font>) turn

<p/><div class="bookquote">``What is your greatest fault?''  (<font color='red'><b>Fred/Fred Vaughn</b></font>)</div>asked Fred, by way of testing in her (<font color='blue'><b>Jo</b></font>) the

<p/>Ned, Frank, and the little girls joined in this, and while it went on,
the three elders sat apart, talking. Miss Kate took out her (<font color='blue'><b>Kate</b></font>) sketch
again, and Margaret watched her (<font color='blue'><b>Margaret</b></font>), while Mr. Brooke lay on the grass with
a book, which he (<font color='blue'><b>Brooke</b></font>) did not read.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``How beautifully you do it! I wish I could draw,''  (<font color='red'><b>Meg</b></font>)</div>said Meg, with

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Oh, indeed!''  (<font color='red'><b>Miss Kate/Kate</b></font>)</div>said Miss Kate, but she (<font color='blue'><b>Kate</b></font>) might as well have said, <div class="bookquote">``Dear

made Meg color, and wish she (<font color='blue'><b>Kate</b></font>) had not been so frank.

<p/>Mr. Brooke looked up and said quickly, <div class="bookquote">``Young ladies in America love
independence as much as their ancestors did, and are admired and
respected for supporting themselves.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Brooke/Brooke</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Oh, yes, of course it's very nice and proper in them to do so. We

Miss Kate in a patronizing tone that hurt Meg's pride, and made her (<font color='blue'><b>Kate</b></font>)
work seem not only more distasteful, but degrading.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Did the German song suit, Miss March?''  (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Brooke/Brooke</b></font>)</div>inquired Mr. Brooke, breaking
an awkward pause.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Oh, yes! It was very sweet, and I'm much obliged to whoever
translated it for me.''  (<font color='red'><b>Meg</b></font>)</div>And Meg's downcast face brightened as she (<font color='blue'><b>Meg</b></font>) spoke.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Don't you read German?''  (<font color='red'><b>Miss Kate/Kate</b></font>)</div>asked Miss Kate with a look of surprise.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Not very well. My father, who taught me, is away, and I don't get on
very fast alone, for I've no one to correct my pronunciation.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Try a little now. Here is Schiller's Mary Stuart and a tutor who
loves to teach.''  (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Brooke/Brooke</b></font>)</div>And Mr. Brooke laid his (<font color='blue'><b>Brooke</b></font>) book on her (<font color='blue'><b>Kate</b></font>) lap with an
inviting smile.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``It's so hard I'm afraid to try,''  (<font color='red'><b>Meg</b></font>)</div>said Meg, grateful, but bashful in
the presence of the accomplished young lady beside her (<font color='blue'><b>Meg</b></font>).

<p/><div class="bookquote">``I'll read a bit to encourage you.''  (<font color='red'><b>Miss Kate/Kate</b></font>)</div>And Miss Kate read one of the most
beautiful passages in a perfectly correct but perfectly expressionless
manner.

<p/>Mr. Brooke made no comment as she (<font color='blue'><b>Kate</b></font>) returned the book to Meg, who said
innocently, <div class="bookquote">``I thought it was poetry.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Meg</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Some of it is. Try this passage.''

 (<font color='red'><b>queer</b></font>)</div><p/>There was a queer smile about Mr. Brooke's mouth as he (<font color='blue'><b>Brooke</b></font>) opened at poor
Mary's lament.

<p/>Meg obediently following the long grass-blade which her (<font color='blue'><b>Meg</b></font>) new tutor used
to point with, read slowly and timidly, unconsciously making poetry of
the hard words by the soft intonation of her (<font color='blue'><b>Meg</b></font>) musical voice. Down the
page went the green guide, and presently, forgetting her (<font color='blue'><b>Meg</b></font>) listener in
the beauty of the sad scene, Meg read as if alone, giving a little
touch of tragedy to the words of the unhappy queen. If she (<font color='blue'><b>Meg</b></font>) had seen
the brown eyes then, she (<font color='blue'><b>Meg</b></font>) would have stopped short, but she (<font color='blue'><b>Meg</b></font>) never looked
up, and the lesson was not spoiled for her (<font color='blue'><b>Meg</b></font>).

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Very well indeed!''  (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Brooke/Brooke</b></font>)</div>said Mr. Brooke, as she (<font color='blue'><b>Meg</b></font>) paused, quite ignoring her (<font color='blue'><b>Meg</b></font>)
many mistakes, and looking as if he (<font color='blue'><b>Brooke</b></font>) did indeed love to teach.

<p/>Miss Kate put up her (<font color='blue'><b>Kate</b></font>) glass, and, having taken a survey of the little
tableau before her (<font color='blue'><b>Kate</b></font>), shut her (<font color='blue'><b>Kate</b></font>) sketch book, saying with condescension,
<div class="bookquote">``You've a nice accent and in time will be a clever reader. I advise
you to learn, for German is a valuable accomplishment to teachers. I
must look after Grace, she (<font color='blue'><b>Grace</b></font>) is romping.''  (<font color='red'><b>her</b></font>)</div>And Miss Kate strolled away,
adding to herself with a shrug, <div class="bookquote">``I didn't come to chaperone a

Yankees are. I'm afraid Laurie will be quite spoiled among them.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Miss Kate/Kate</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I forgot that English people rather turn up their noses at governesses
and don't treat them as we do,''  (<font color='red'><b>Meg</b></font>)</div>said Meg, looking after the retreating
figure with an annoyed expression.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Tutors also have rather a hard time of it there, as I know to my
sorrow. There's no place like America for us workers, Miss Margaret.''
 (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Brooke/Brooke</b></font>)</div>And Mr. Brooke looked so contented and cheerful that Meg was ashamed to
lament her (<font color='blue'><b>Meg</b></font>) hard lot.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``I'm glad I live in it then. I don't like my work, but I get a good

wished I liked teaching as you do.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I think you would if you had Laurie for a pupil. I shall be very
sorry to lose him (<font color='blue'><b>Laurie</b></font>) next year,''  (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Brooke/Brooke</b></font>)</div>said Mr. Brooke, busily punching holes in
the turf.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Going to college, I suppose?''  (<font color='red'><b>Meg</b></font>)</div>Meg's lips asked the question, but her (<font color='blue'><b>Meg</b></font>)
eyes added, <div class="bookquote">``And what becomes of you?''

 (<font color='red'><b>Meg</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Yes, it's high time he (<font color='blue'><b>Laurie</b></font>) went, for he (<font color='blue'><b>Laurie</b></font>) is ready, and as soon as he (<font color='blue'><b>Laurie</b></font>) is
off, I shall turn soldier. I am needed.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I am glad of that!''  (<font color='red'><b>Meg</b></font>)</div>exclaimed Meg. <div class="bookquote">``I should think every young man
would want to go, though it is hard for the mothers and sisters who
stay at home,''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Meg</b></font>) added sorrowfully.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``I have neither, and very few friends to care whether I live or die,''
 (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Brooke/Brooke</b></font>)</div>said Mr. Brooke rather bitterly as he (<font color='blue'><b>Brooke</b></font>) absently put the dead rose in the
hole he (<font color='blue'><b>Brooke</b></font>) had made and covered it up, like a little grave.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Laurie and his (<font color='blue'><b>Laurie</b></font>) grandfather would care a great deal, and we should all
be very sorry to have any harm happen to you,''  (<font color='red'><b>Meg</b></font>)</div>said Meg heartily.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Thank you, that sounds pleasant,''  (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Brooke/Brooke</b></font>)</div>began Mr. Brooke, looking cheerful
again, but before he (<font color='blue'><b>Brooke</b></font>) could finish his (<font color='blue'><b>Brooke</b></font>) speech, Ned, mounted on the old
horse, came lumbering up to display his (<font color='blue'><b>Ned</b></font>) equestrian skill before the
young ladies, and there was no more quiet that day.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Don't you love to ride?''  (<font color='red'><b>Grace</b></font>)</div>asked Grace of Amy, as they stood resting
after a race round the field with the others, led by Ned.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``I dote upon it. My sister, Meg, used to ride when Papa was rich, but
we don't keep any horses now, except Ellen Tree,''  (<font color='red'><b>Amy/Amy March</b></font>)</div>added Amy, laughing.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Tell me about Ellen Tree. Is it a donkey?''  (<font color='red'><b>Grace</b></font>)</div>asked Grace curiously.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Why, you see, Jo is crazy about horses and so am I, but we've only got
an old sidesaddle and no horse. Out in our garden is an apple tree
that has a nice low branch, so Jo put the saddle on it, fixed some
reins on the part that turns up, and we bounce away on Ellen Tree
whenever we like.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``How funny!''  (<font color='red'><b>Grace</b></font>)</div>laughed Grace. <div class="bookquote">``I have a pony at home, and ride nearly
every day in the park with Fred and Kate. It's very nice, for my
friends go too, and the Row is full of ladies and gentlemen.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Dear, how charming! I hope I shall go abroad some day, but I'd rather
go to Rome than the Row,''  (<font color='red'><b>Amy/Amy March</b></font>)</div>said Amy, who had not the remotest idea what
the Row was and wouldn't have asked for the world.

<p/>Frank, sitting just behind the little girls, heard what they were
saying, and pushed his (<font color='blue'><b>Frank</b></font>) crutch away from him (<font color='blue'><b>Frank</b></font>) with an impatient gesture
as he (<font color='blue'><b>Frank</b></font>) watched the active lads going through all sorts of comical
gymnastics. Beth, who was collecting the scattered Author cards,
looked up and said, in her (<font color='blue'><b>Beth</b></font>) shy yet friendly way, <div class="bookquote">``I'm afraid you are
tired. Can I do anything for you?''

 (<font color='red'><b>Author</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Talk to me, please. It's dull, sitting by myself,''  (<font color='red'><b>Frank</b></font>)</div>answered Frank,
who had evidently been used to being made much of at home.

<p/>If he (<font color='blue'><b>Frank</b></font>) asked her (<font color='blue'><b>Beth</b></font>) to deliver a Latin oration, it would not have seemed a
more impossible task to bashful Beth, but there was no place to run to,
no Jo to hide behind now, and the poor boy looked so wistfully at her (<font color='blue'><b>Jo</b></font>)
that she (<font color='blue'><b>Jo</b></font>) bravely resolved to try.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``What do you like to talk about?''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Jo</b></font>) asked, fumbling over the cards
and dropping half as she (<font color='blue'><b>Jo</b></font>) tried to tie them up.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Well, I like to hear about cricket and boating and hunting,''  (<font color='red'><b>Frank</b></font>)</div>said
Frank, who had not yet learned to suit his (<font color='blue'><b>Frank</b></font>) amusements to his (<font color='blue'><b>Frank</b></font>) strength.

<p/>My heart! What shall I do? I don't know anything about them, thought
Beth, and forgetting the boy's misfortune in her (<font color='blue'><b>Beth</b></font>) flurry, she (<font color='blue'><b>Beth</b></font>) said,
hoping to make him (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>) talk, <div class="bookquote">``I never saw any hunting, but I suppose you
know all about it.''

 (<font color='red'><b>him</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I did once, but I can never hunt again, for I got hurt leaping a
confounded five-barred gate, so there are no more horses and hounds for
me,''  (<font color='red'><b>Frank</b></font>)</div>said Frank with a sigh that made Beth hate herself for her (<font color='blue'><b>Beth</b></font>)
innocent blunder.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Your deer are much prettier than our ugly buffaloes,''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Beth</b></font>) said,
turning to the prairies for help and feeling glad that she (<font color='blue'><b>Beth</b></font>) had read one
of the boys' books in which Jo delighted.

<p/>Buffaloes proved soothing and satisfactory, and in her (<font color='blue'><b>Jo</b></font>) eagerness to
amuse another, Beth forgot herself, and was quite unconscious of her (<font color='blue'><b>Beth</b></font>)
sisters' surprise and delight at the unusual spectacle of Beth talking
away to one of the dreadful boys, against whom she (<font color='blue'><b>Beth</b></font>) had begged
protection.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Bless her (<font color='blue'><b>I</b></font>) heart! She (<font color='blue'><b>I</b></font>) pities him (<font color='blue'><b>I</b></font>), so she (<font color='blue'><b>I</b></font>) is good to him (<font color='blue'><b>I</b></font>),''  (<font color='red'><b>Jo/Miss Jo/JO</b></font>)</div>said Jo,
beaming at her (<font color='blue'><b>Jo</b></font>) from the croquet ground.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``I always said she (<font color='blue'><b>I</b></font>) was a little saint,''  (<font color='red'><b>Meg</b></font>)</div>added Meg, as if there could be
no further doubt of it.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``I haven't heard Frank laugh so much for ever so long,''  (<font color='red'><b>Grace</b></font>)</div>said Grace to
Amy, as they sat discussing dolls and making tea sets out of the acorn
cups.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``My sister Beth is a very fastidious girl, when she (<font color='blue'><b>Beth</b></font>) likes to be,''  (<font color='red'><b>Amy/Amy March</b></font>)</div>said
Amy, well pleased at Beth's success. She (<font color='blue'><b>Beth</b></font>) meant `facinating', but as
Grace didn't know the exact meaning of either word, fastidious sounded
well and made a good impression.

<p/>An impromptu circus, fox and geese, and an amicable game of croquet
finished the afternoon. At sunset the tent was struck, hampers packed,
wickets pulled up, boats loaded, and the whole party floated down the
river, singing at the tops of their voices. Ned, getting sentimental,
warbled a serenade with the pensive refrain...

<p/>Alone, alone, ah! Woe, alone,

<p/>and at the lines...

<p/>We each are young, we each have a heart,
Oh, why should we stand thus coldly apart?

<p/>he (<font color='blue'><b>Ned</b></font>) looked at Meg with such a lackadiasical expression that she (<font color='blue'><b>Meg</b></font>) laughed
outright and spoiled his (<font color='blue'><b>Ned</b></font>) song.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``How can you be so cruel to me?''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Ned</b></font>) whispered, under cover of a lively
chorus. <div class="bookquote">``You've kept close to that starched-up Englishwoman all day,
and now you snub me.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I didn't mean to, but you looked so funny I really couldn't help it,''
 (<font color='red'><b>Meg</b></font>)</div>replied Meg, passing over the first part of his (<font color='blue'><b>Ned</b></font>) reproach, for it was
quite true that she (<font color='blue'><b>Meg</b></font>) had shunned him (<font color='blue'><b>Ned</b></font>), remembering the Moffat party and
the talk after it.

<p/>Ned was offended and turned to Sallie for consolation, saying to her (<font color='blue'><b>Sallie</b></font>)
rather pettishly, <div class="bookquote">``There isn't a bit of flirt in that girl, is there?''

 (<font color='red'><b>Sallie/Miss Sallie</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Not a particle, but she (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>)'s a dear,''  (<font color='red'><b>Sallie/Miss Sallie</b></font>)</div>returned Sallie, defending her (<font color='blue'><b>Sallie</b></font>)
friend even while confessing her (<font color='blue'><b>Sallie</b></font>) shortcomings.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``She (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>)'s not a stricken deer anyway,''  (<font color='red'><b>Ned/Ned Moffat/Moffat</b></font>)</div>said Ned, trying to be witty, and
succeeding as well as very young gentlemen usually do.

<p/>On the lawn where it had gathered, the little party separated with
cordial good nights and good-byes, for the Vaughns were going to Canada.
As the four sisters went home through the garden, Miss Kate looked
after them, saying, without the patronizing tone in her (<font color='blue'><b>Kate</b></font>) voice, <div class="bookquote">``In
spite of their demonstrative manners, American girls are very nice when
one knows them.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Miss Kate/Kate</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I quite agree with you,''  (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Brooke/Brooke</b></font>)</div>said Mr. Brooke.



<p/>CHAPTER THIRTEEN

<p/>CASTLES IN THE AIR

<p/>Laurie lay luxuriously swinging to and fro in his (<font color='blue'><b>Laurie</b></font>) hammock one warm
September afternoon, wondering what his (<font color='blue'><b>Laurie</b></font>) neighbors were about, but too
lazy to go and find out. He (<font color='blue'><b>Laurie</b></font>) was in one of his (<font color='blue'><b>Laurie</b></font>) moods, for the day had
been both unprofitable and unsatisfactory, and he (<font color='blue'><b>Laurie</b></font>) was wishing he (<font color='blue'><b>Laurie</b></font>) could
live it over again. The hot weather made him (<font color='blue'><b>Laurie</b></font>) indolent, and he (<font color='blue'><b>Laurie</b></font>) had
shirked his (<font color='blue'><b>Laurie</b></font>) studies, tried Mr. Brooke's patience to the utmost,
displeased his (<font color='blue'><b>Laurie</b></font>) grandfather by practicing half the afternoon, frightened
the maidservants half out of their wits by mischievously hinting that
one of his (<font color='blue'><b>Laurie</b></font>) dogs was going mad, and, after high words with the stableman
about some fancied neglect of his (<font color='blue'><b>Laurie</b></font>) horse, he (<font color='blue'><b>Laurie</b></font>) had flung himself into his (<font color='blue'><b>Laurie</b></font>)
hammock to fume over the stupidity of the world in general, till the
peace of the lovely day quieted him (<font color='blue'><b>Laurie</b></font>) in spite of himself. Staring up
into the green gloom of the horse-chestnut trees above him (<font color='blue'><b>Laurie</b></font>), he (<font color='blue'><b>Laurie</b></font>) dreamed
dreams of all sorts, and was just imagining himself tossing on the
ocean in a voyage round the world, when the sound of voices brought him (<font color='blue'><b>Laurie</b></font>)
ashore in a flash. Peeping through the meshes of the hammock, he (<font color='blue'><b>Laurie</b></font>) saw
the Marches coming out, as if bound on some expedition.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``What in the world are those girls about now?''  (<font color='red'><b>Laurie/Mr. Laurie/LAURIE</b></font>)</div>thought Laurie, opening
his (<font color='blue'><b>Laurie</b></font>) sleepy eyes to take a good look, for there was something rather
peculiar in the appearance of his (<font color='blue'><b>Laurie</b></font>) neighbors. Each wore a large,
flapping hat, a brown linen pouch slung over one shoulder, and carried
a long staff. Meg had a cushion, Jo a book, Beth a basket, and Amy a
portfolio. All walked quietly through the garden, out at the little
back gate, and began to climb the hill that lay between the house and
river.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Well, that's cool,''  (<font color='red'><b>Laurie/Mr. Laurie/LAURIE</b></font>)</div>said Laurie to himself, <div class="bookquote">``to have a picnic and
never ask me! They can't be going in the boat, for they haven't got
the key. Perhaps they forgot it. I'll take it to them, and see what's
going on.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Laurie/Mr. Laurie/LAURIE</b></font>)</div><p/>Though possessed of half a dozen hats, it took him (<font color='blue'><b>Laurie</b></font>) some time to find
one, then there was a hunt for the key, which was at last discovered in
his (<font color='blue'><b>Laurie</b></font>) pocket, so that the girls were quite out of sight when he (<font color='blue'><b>Laurie</b></font>) leaped
the fence and ran after them. Taking the shortest way to the
boathouse, he (<font color='blue'><b>Laurie</b></font>) waited for them to appear, but no one came, and he (<font color='blue'><b>Laurie</b></font>) went
up the hill to take an observation. A grove of pines covered one part
of it, and from the heart of this green spot came a clearer sound than
the soft sigh of the pines or the drowsy chirp of the crickets.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Here's a landscape!''  (<font color='red'><b>Laurie/Mr. Laurie/LAURIE</b></font>)</div>thought Laurie, peeping through the bushes, and
looking wide-awake and good-natured already.

<p/>It was a rather pretty little picture, for the sisters sat together in
the shady nook, with sun and shadow flickering over them, the aromatic
wind lifting their hair and cooling their hot cheeks, and all the
little wood people going on with their affairs as if these were no
strangers but old friends. Meg sat upon her (<font color='blue'><b>Meg</b></font>) cushion, sewing daintily
with her (<font color='blue'><b>Meg</b></font>) white hands, and looking as fresh and sweet as a rose in her (<font color='blue'><b>Meg</b></font>)
pink dress among the green. Beth was sorting the cones that lay thick
under the hemlock near by, for she (<font color='blue'><b>Beth</b></font>) made pretty things with them. Amy
was sketching a group of ferns, and Jo was knitting as she (<font color='blue'><b>Jo</b></font>) read aloud.
A shadow passed over the boy's face as he (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>) watched them, feeling that he (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>)
ought to go away because uninvited; yet lingering because home seemed
very lonely and this quiet party in the woods most attractive to his (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>)
restless spirit. He (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>) stood so still that a squirrel, busy with its
harvesting, ran down a pine close beside him (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>), saw him (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>) suddenly and
skipped back, scolding so shrilly that Beth looked up, espied the
wistful face behind the birches, and beckoned with a reassuring smile.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``May I come in, please? Or shall I be a bother?''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>) asked, advancing
slowly.

<p/>Meg lifted her (<font color='blue'><b>Meg</b></font>) eyebrows, but Jo scowled at her (<font color='blue'><b>Jo</b></font>) defiantly and said at
once, <div class="bookquote">``Of course you may. We should have asked you before, only we
thought you wouldn't care for such a girl's game as this.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Jo/Miss Jo/JO</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I always like your games, but if Meg doesn't want me, I'll go away.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I've no objection, if you do something. It's against the rules to be
idle here,''  (<font color='red'><b>Meg</b></font>)</div>replied Meg gravely but graciously.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Much obliged. I'll do anything if you'll let me stop a bit, for it's
as dull as the Desert of Sahara down there. Shall I sew, read, cone,
draw, or do all at once? Bring on your bears. I'm ready.''  (<font color='red'><b>Laurie/Mr. Laurie/LAURIE</b></font>)</div>And Laurie
sat down with a submissive expression delightful to behold.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Finish this story while I set my heel,''  (<font color='red'><b>Jo/Miss Jo/JO</b></font>)</div>said Jo, handing him (<font color='blue'><b>Laurie</b></font>) the book.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Yes'm.''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>was the meek answer, as he (<font color='blue'><b>Laurie</b></font>) began, doing his (<font color='blue'><b>Laurie</b></font>) best to prove his (<font color='blue'><b>Laurie</b></font>)
gratitude for the favor of admission into the ``Busy Bee Society'.

<p/>The story was not a long one, and when it was finished, he (<font color='blue'><b>your</b></font>) ventured to
ask a few questions as a reward of merit.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Please, ma'am, could I inquire if this highly instructive and charming
institution is a new one?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Would you tell him (<font color='blue'><b>your</b></font>)?''  (<font color='red'><b>Meg</b></font>)</div>asked Meg of her (<font color='blue'><b>Meg</b></font>) sisters.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``He (<font color='blue'><b>your</b></font>)'ll laugh,''  (<font color='red'><b>Amy/Amy March</b></font>)</div>said Amy warningly.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Who cares?''  (<font color='red'><b>Jo/Miss Jo/JO</b></font>)</div>said Jo.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``I guess he (<font color='blue'><b>your</b></font>)'ll like it,''  (<font color='red'><b>Beth</b></font>)</div>added Beth.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Of course I shall! I give you my word I won't laugh. Tell away, Jo,
and don't be afraid.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``The idea of being afraid of you! Well, you see we used to play
Pilgrim's Progress, and we have been going on with it in earnest, all
winter and summer.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Yes, I know,''  (<font color='red'><b>Laurie/Mr. Laurie/LAURIE</b></font>)</div>said Laurie, nodding wisely.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Who told you?''  (<font color='red'><b>Jo/Miss Jo/JO</b></font>)</div>demanded Jo.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Spirits.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``No, I did. I wanted to amuse him (<font color='blue'><b>Pilgrim</b></font>) one night when you were all away,
and he (<font color='blue'><b>Pilgrim</b></font>) was rather dismal. He (<font color='blue'><b>Pilgrim</b></font>) did like it, so don't scold, Jo,''  (<font color='red'><b>Beth</b></font>)</div>said
Beth meekly.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``You can't keep a secret. Never mind, it saves trouble now.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Go on, please,''  (<font color='red'><b>Laurie/Mr. Laurie/LAURIE</b></font>)</div>said Laurie, as Jo became absorbed in her (<font color='blue'><b>Jo</b></font>) work,
looking a trifle displeased.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Oh, didn't she (<font color='blue'><b>Jo</b></font>) tell you about this new plan of ours? Well, we have
tried not to waste our holiday, but each has had a task and worked at
it with a will. The vacation is nearly over, the stints are all done,
and we are ever so glad that we didn't dawdle.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Yes, I should think so,''  (<font color='red'><b>Laurie/Mr. Laurie/LAURIE</b></font>)</div>and Laurie thought regretfully of his (<font color='blue'><b>Laurie</b></font>) own
idle days.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Mother likes to have us out-of-doors as much as possible, so we bring
our work here and have nice times. For the fun of it we bring our
things in these bags, wear the old hats, use poles to climb the hill,
and play pilgrims, as we used to do years ago. We call this hill the
Delectable Mountain, for we can look far away and see the country where
we hope to live some time.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Jo/Miss Jo/JO</b></font>)</div><p/>Jo pointed, and Laurie sat up to examine, for through an opening in the
wood one could look cross the wide, blue river, the meadows on the
other side, far over the outskirts of the great city, to the green
hills that rose to meet the sky. The sun was low, and the heavens
glowed with the splendor of an autumn sunset. Gold and purple clouds
lay on the hilltops, and rising high into the ruddy light were silvery
white peaks that shone like the airy spires of some Celestial City.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``How beautiful that is!''  (<font color='red'><b>Laurie/Mr. Laurie/LAURIE</b></font>)</div>said Laurie softly, for he (<font color='blue'><b>Laurie</b></font>) was quick to see
and feel beauty of any kind.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``It's often so, and we like to watch it, for it is never the same, but
always splendid,''  (<font color='red'><b>Amy/Amy March</b></font>)</div>replied Amy, wishing she (<font color='blue'><b>Amy</b></font>) could paint it.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Jo talks about the country where we hope to live sometime--the real
country, she (<font color='blue'><b>Jo</b></font>) means, with pigs and chickens and haymaking. It would be
nice, but I wish the beautiful country up there was real, and we could
ever go to it,''  (<font color='red'><b>Beth</b></font>)</div>said Beth musingly.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``There is a lovelier country even than that, where we shall go,
by-and-by, when we are good enough,''  (<font color='red'><b>Meg</b></font>)</div>answered Meg with her (<font color='blue'><b>Beth</b></font>) sweetest
voice.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``It seems so long to wait, so hard to do. I want to fly away at once,
as those swallows fly, and go in at that splendid gate.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``You'll get there, Beth, sooner or later, no fear of that,''  (<font color='red'><b>Jo/Miss Jo/JO</b></font>)</div>said Jo.
<div class="bookquote">``I'm the one that will have to fight and work, and climb and wait, and
maybe never get in after all.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``You'll have me for company, if that's any comfort. I shall have to do
a deal of traveling before I come in sight of your Celestial City. If
I arrive late, you'll say a good word for me, won't you, Beth?''

 (<font color='red'><b>the boy</b></font>)</div><p/>Something in the boy's face troubled his (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>) little friend, but she (<font color='blue'><b>Jo</b></font>) said
cheerfully, with her (<font color='blue'><b>Jo</b></font>) quiet eyes on the changing clouds, <div class="bookquote">``If people
really want to go, and really try all their lives, I think they will
get in, for I don't believe there are any locks on that door or any
guards at the gate. I always imagine it is as it is in the picture,
where the shining ones stretch out their hands to welcome poor
Christian as he (<font color='blue'><b>Christian</b></font>) comes up from the river.''

 (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Wouldn't it be fun if all the castles in the air which we make could
come true, and we could live in them?''  (<font color='red'><b>Jo/Miss Jo/JO</b></font>)</div>said Jo, after a little pause.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``I've made such quantities it would be hard to choose which I'd have,''
 (<font color='red'><b>Laurie/Mr. Laurie/LAURIE</b></font>)</div>said Laurie, lying flat and throwing cones at the squirrel who had
betrayed him (<font color='blue'><b>Laurie</b></font>).

<p/><div class="bookquote">``You'd have to take your favorite one. What is it?''  (<font color='red'><b>Meg</b></font>)</div>asked Meg.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``If I tell mine, will you tell yours?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Yes, if the girls will too.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``We will. Now, Laurie.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``After I'd seen as much of the world as I want to, I'd like to settle
in Germany and have just as much music as I choose. I'm to be a famous
musician myself, and all creation is to rush to hear me. And I'm never
to be bothered about money or business, but just enjoy myself and live
for what I like. That's my favorite castle. What's yours, Meg?''

 (<font color='red'><b>Margaret/Miss Margaret</b></font>)</div><p/>Margaret seemed to find it a little hard to tell hers, and waved a
brake before her (<font color='blue'><b>Margaret</b></font>) face, as if to disperse imaginary gnats, while she (<font color='blue'><b>Margaret</b></font>)
said slowly, <div class="bookquote">``I should like a lovely house, full of all sorts of
luxurious things--nice food, pretty clothes, handsome furniture,
pleasant people, and heaps of money. I am to be mistress of it, and
manage it as I like, with plenty of servants, so I never need work a
bit. How I should enjoy it! For I wouldn't be idle, but do good, and
make everyone love me dearly.''

 (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Wouldn't you have a master for your castle in the air?''  (<font color='red'><b>Laurie/Mr. Laurie/LAURIE</b></font>)</div>asked Laurie
slyly.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``I said `pleasant people', you know,''  (<font color='red'><b>Meg</b></font>)</div>and Meg carefully tied up her (<font color='blue'><b>Meg</b></font>)
shoe as she (<font color='blue'><b>Meg</b></font>) spoke, so that no one saw her (<font color='blue'><b>Meg</b></font>) face.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Why don't you say you'd have a splendid, wise, good husband and some
angelic little children? You know your castle wouldn't be perfect
without,''  (<font color='red'><b>Jo/Miss Jo/JO</b></font>)</div>said blunt Jo, who had no tender fancies yet, and rather
scorned romance, except in books.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``You'd have nothing but horses, inkstands, and novels in yours,''
 (<font color='red'><b>Meg</b></font>)</div>answered Meg petulantly.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Wouldn't I though? I'd have a stable full of Arabian steeds, rooms
piled high with books, and I'd write out of a magic inkstand, so that
my works should be as famous as Laurie's music. I want to do something
splendid before I go into my castle, something heroic or wonderful that
won't be forgotten after I'm dead. I don't know what, but I'm on the
watch for it, and mean to astonish you all some day. I think I shall
write books, and get rich and famous, that would suit me, so that is my
favorite dream.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Mine is to stay at home safe with Father and Mother, and help take
care of the family,''  (<font color='red'><b>Beth</b></font>)</div>said Beth contentedly.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Don't you wish for anything else?''  (<font color='red'><b>Laurie/Mr. Laurie/LAURIE</b></font>)</div>asked Laurie.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Since I had my little piano, I am perfectly satisfied. I only wish we
may all keep well and be together, nothing else.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I have ever so many wishes, but the pet one is to be an artist, and go
to Rome, and do fine pictures, and be the best artist in the whole
world,''  (<font color='red'><b>Amy/Amy March</b></font>)</div>was Amy's modest desire.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``We're an ambitious set, aren't we? Every one of us, but Beth, wants
to be rich and famous, and gorgeous in every respect. I do wonder if
any of us will ever get our wishes,''  (<font color='red'><b>Laurie/Mr. Laurie/LAURIE</b></font>)</div>said Laurie, chewing grass like a
meditative calf.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``I've got the key to my castle in the air, but whether I can unlock the
door remains to be seen,''  (<font color='red'><b>Jo/Miss Jo/JO</b></font>)</div>observed Jo mysteriously.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``I've got the key to mine, but I'm not allowed to try it. Hang
college!''  (<font color='red'><b>Laurie/Mr. Laurie/LAURIE</b></font>)</div>muttered Laurie with an impatient sigh.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Here's mine!''  (<font color='red'><b>Amy/Amy March</b></font>)</div>and Amy waved her (<font color='blue'><b>Amy</b></font>) pencil.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``I haven't got any,''  (<font color='red'><b>Meg</b></font>)</div>said Meg forlornly.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Yes, you have,''  (<font color='red'><b>Laurie/Mr. Laurie/LAURIE</b></font>)</div>said Laurie at once.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Where?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``In your face.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Nonsense, that's of no use.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Wait and see if it doesn't bring you something worth having,''  (<font color='red'><b>the boy</b></font>)</div>replied
the boy, laughing at the thought of a charming little secret which he (<font color='blue'><b>Laurie</b></font>)
fancied he (<font color='blue'><b>Laurie</b></font>) knew.

<p/>Meg colored behind the brake, but asked no questions and looked across
the river with the same expectant expression which Mr. Brooke had worn
when he (<font color='blue'><b>Brooke</b></font>) told the story of the knight.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``If we are all alive ten years hence, let's meet, and see how many of
us have got our wishes, or how much nearer we are then than now,''  (<font color='red'><b>Jo/Miss Jo/JO</b></font>)</div>said
Jo, always ready with a plan.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Bless me! How old I shall be, twenty-seven!''  (<font color='red'><b>Meg</b></font>)</div>exclaimed Meg, who felt
grown up already, having just reached seventeen.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``You and I will be twenty-six, Teddy, Beth twenty-four, and Amy
twenty-two. What a venerable party!''  (<font color='red'><b>Jo/Miss Jo/JO</b></font>)</div>said Jo.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``I hope I shall have done something to be proud of by that time, but
I'm such a lazy dog, I'm afraid I shall dawdle, Jo.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``You need a motive, Mother says, and when you get it, she (<font color='blue'><b>Mother</b></font>) is sure
you'll work splendidly.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Is she (<font color='blue'><b>Mother</b></font>)? By Jupiter, I will, if I only get the chance!''  (<font color='red'><b>Laurie/Mr. Laurie/LAURIE</b></font>)</div>cried Laurie,
sitting up with sudden energy. <div class="bookquote">``I ought to be satisfied to please
Grandfather, and I do try, but it's working against the grain, you see,
and comes hard. He (<font color='blue'><b>Grandfather</b></font>) wants me to be an India merchant, as he (<font color='blue'><b>Grandfather</b></font>) was, and
I'd rather be shot. I hate tea and silk and spices, and every sort of
rubbish his (<font color='blue'><b>Grandfather</b></font>) old ships bring, and I don't care how soon they go to the
bottom when I own them. Going to college ought to satisfy him (<font color='blue'><b>Grandfather</b></font>), for if
I give him (<font color='blue'><b>Grandfather</b></font>) four years he (<font color='blue'><b>Grandfather</b></font>) ought to let me off from the business. But
he (<font color='blue'><b>Grandfather</b></font>)'s set, and I've got to do just as he (<font color='blue'><b>Grandfather</b></font>) did, unless I break away and
please myself, as my father did. If there was anyone left to stay with
the old gentleman, I'd do it tomorrow.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Laurie/Mr. Laurie/LAURIE</b></font>)</div><p/>Laurie spoke excitedly, and looked ready to carry his (<font color='blue'><b>Laurie</b></font>) threat into
execution on the slightest provocation, for he (<font color='blue'><b>Laurie</b></font>) was growing up very fast
and, in spite of his (<font color='blue'><b>Laurie</b></font>) indolent ways, had a young man's hatred of
subjection, a young man's restless longing to try the world for himself.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``I advise you to sail away in one of your ships, and never come home
again till you have tried your own way,''  (<font color='red'><b>Jo/Miss Jo/JO</b></font>)</div>said Jo, whose imagination was
fired by the thought of such a daring exploit, and whose sympathy was
excited by what she (<font color='blue'><b>Jo</b></font>) called ``Teddy's Wrongs'.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``That's not right, Jo. You mustn't talk in that way, and Laurie
mustn't take your bad advice. You should do just what your grandfather
wishes, my dear boy,''  (<font color='red'><b>Meg</b></font>)</div>said Meg in her (<font color='blue'><b>Meg</b></font>) most maternal tone. <div class="bookquote">``Do your best
at college, and when he (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>) sees that you try to please him (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>), I'm sure he (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>)
won't be hard on you or unjust to you. As you say, there is no one
else to stay with and love him (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>), and you'd never forgive yourself if you
left him (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>) without his (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>) permission. Don't be dismal or fret, but do your
duty and you'll get your reward, as good Mr. Brooke has, by being
respected and loved.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``What do you know about him (<font color='blue'><b>Brooke</b></font>)?''  (<font color='red'><b>Laurie/Mr. Laurie/LAURIE</b></font>)</div>asked Laurie, grateful for the good
advice, but objecting to the lecture, and glad to turn the conversation
from himself after his (<font color='blue'><b>Laurie</b></font>) unusual outbreak.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Only what your grandpa told us about him (<font color='blue'><b>grandpa</b></font>), how he (<font color='blue'><b>grandpa</b></font>) took good care of his (<font color='blue'><b>grandpa</b></font>)
own mother till she (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) died, and wouldn't go abroad as tutor to some nice
person because he (<font color='blue'><b>grandpa</b></font>) wouldn't leave her (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>). And how he (<font color='blue'><b>grandpa</b></font>) provides now for an
old woman who nursed his (<font color='blue'><b>grandpa</b></font>) mother, and never tells anyone, but is just as
generous and patient and good as he (<font color='blue'><b>patient</b></font>) can be.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``So he (<font color='blue'><b>patient</b></font>) is, dear old fellow!''  (<font color='red'><b>Laurie/Mr. Laurie/LAURIE</b></font>)</div>said Laurie heartily, as Meg paused,
looking flushed and earnest with her (<font color='blue'><b>Meg</b></font>) story. <div class="bookquote">``It's like Grandpa to find
out all about him (<font color='blue'><b>Grandpa</b></font>) without letting him (<font color='blue'><b>Grandpa</b></font>) know, and to tell all his (<font color='blue'><b>Grandpa</b></font>)
goodness to others, so that they might like him (<font color='blue'><b>Grandpa</b></font>). Brooke couldn't
understand why your mother was so kind to him (<font color='blue'><b>Brooke</b></font>), asking him (<font color='blue'><b>Brooke</b></font>) over with me
and treating him (<font color='blue'><b>Brooke</b></font>) in her (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) beautiful friendly way. He (<font color='blue'><b>Brooke</b></font>) thought she (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) was
just perfect, and talked about it for days and days, and went on about
you all in flaming style. If ever I do get my wish, you see what I'll
do for Brooke.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Begin to do something now by not plaguing his (<font color='blue'><b>Brooke</b></font>) life out,''  (<font color='red'><b>Meg</b></font>)</div>said Meg
sharply.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``How do you know I do, Miss?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I can always tell by his (<font color='blue'><b>Brooke</b></font>) face when he (<font color='blue'><b>Brooke</b></font>) goes away. If you have been
good, he (<font color='blue'><b>Brooke</b></font>) looks satisfied and walks briskly. If you have plagued him (<font color='blue'><b>Brooke</b></font>),
he (<font color='blue'><b>Brooke</b></font>)'s sober and walks slowly, as if he (<font color='blue'><b>Brooke</b></font>) wanted to go back and do his (<font color='blue'><b>Brooke</b></font>) work
better.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Well, I like that? So you keep an account of my good and bad marks in
Brooke's face, do you? I see him (<font color='blue'><b>Brooke</b></font>) bow and smile as he (<font color='blue'><b>Brooke</b></font>) passes your
window, but I didn't know you'd got up a telegraph.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``We haven't. Don't be angry, and oh, don't tell him (<font color='blue'><b>Brooke</b></font>) I said anything!
It was only to show that I cared how you get on, and what is said here
is said in confidence, you know,''  (<font color='red'><b>Meg</b></font>)</div>cried Meg, much alarmed at the
thought of what might follow from her (<font color='blue'><b>Meg</b></font>) careless speech.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``I don't tell tales,''  (<font color='red'><b>Laurie/Mr. Laurie/LAURIE</b></font>)</div>replied Laurie, with his (<font color='blue'><b>Laurie</b></font>) `high and mighty' air,
as Jo called a certain expression which he (<font color='blue'><b>Laurie</b></font>) occasionally wore. <div class="bookquote">``Only if
Brooke is going to be a thermometer, I must mind and have fair weather
for him (<font color='blue'><b>Brooke</b></font>) to report.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Please don't be offended. I didn't mean to preach or tell tales or be
silly. I only thought Jo was encouraging you in a feeling which you'd
be sorry for by-and-by. You are so kind to us, we feel as if you were
our brother and say just what we think. Forgive me, I meant it kindly.''
 (<font color='red'><b>Meg</b></font>)</div>And Meg offered her (<font color='blue'><b>Meg</b></font>) hand with a gesture both affectionate and timid.

<p/>Ashamed of his (<font color='blue'><b>Laurie</b></font>) momentary pique, Laurie squeezed the kind little hand,
and said frankly, <div class="bookquote">``I'm the one to be forgiven. I'm cross and have been
out of sorts all day. I like to have you tell me my faults and be
sisterly, so don't mind if I am grumpy sometimes. I thank you all the
same.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Laurie/Mr. Laurie/LAURIE</b></font>)</div><p/>Bent on showing that he (<font color='blue'><b>Bent</b></font>) was not offended, he (<font color='blue'><b>Bent</b></font>) made himself as agreeable
as possible, wound cotton for Meg, recited poetry to please Jo, shook
down cones for Beth, and helped Amy with her (<font color='blue'><b>Amy</b></font>) ferns, proving himself a
fit person to belong to the ``Busy Bee Society'. In the midst of an
animated discussion on the domestic habits of turtles -LRB-one of those
amiable creatures having strolled up from the river-RRB-, the faint sound
of a bell warned them that Hannah had put the tea `to draw', and they
would just have time to get home to supper.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``May I come again?''  (<font color='red'><b>Laurie/Mr. Laurie/LAURIE</b></font>)</div>asked Laurie.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Yes, if you are good, and love your book, as the boys in the primer
are told to do,''  (<font color='red'><b>Meg</b></font>)</div>said Meg, smiling.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``I'll try.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Then you may come, and I'll teach you to knit as the Scotchmen do.
There's a demand for socks just now,''  (<font color='red'><b>Jo/Miss Jo/JO</b></font>)</div>added Jo, waving hers like a big
blue worsted banner as they parted at the gate.

<p/>That night, when Beth played to Mr. Laurence in the twilight, Laurie,
standing in the shadow of the curtain, listened to the little David,
whose simple music always quieted his (<font color='blue'><b>David</b></font>) moody spirit, and watched the old
man, who sat with his (<font color='blue'><b>David</b></font>) gray head on his (<font color='blue'><b>David</b></font>) hand, thinking tender thoughts
of the dead child he (<font color='blue'><b>David</b></font>) had loved so much. Remembering the conversation of
the afternoon, the boy said to himself, with the resolve to make the
sacrifice cheerfully, <div class="bookquote">``I'll let my castle go, and stay with the dear
old gentleman while he (<font color='blue'><b>gentleman</b></font>) needs me, for I am all he (<font color='blue'><b>gentleman</b></font>) has.''



 (<font color='red'><b>the boy</b></font>)</div><p/>CHAPTER FOURTEEN

<p/>SECRETS

<p/>Jo was very busy in the garret, for the October days began to grow
chilly, and the afternoons were short. For two or three hours the sun
lay warmly in the high window, showing Jo seated on the old sofa,
writing busily, with her (<font color='blue'><b>Jo</b></font>) papers spread out upon a trunk before her (<font color='blue'><b>Jo</b></font>),
while Scrabble, the pet rat, promenaded the beams overhead, accompanied
by his (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>) oldest son, a fine young fellow, who was evidently very proud of
his (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>) whiskers. Quite absorbed in her (<font color='blue'><b>Jo</b></font>) work, Jo scribbled away till the
last page was filled, when she (<font color='blue'><b>Jo</b></font>) signed her (<font color='blue'><b>Jo</b></font>) name with a flourish and
threw down her (<font color='blue'><b>Jo</b></font>) pen, exclaiming...

<p/><div class="bookquote">``There, I've done my best! If this won't suit I shall have to wait
till I can do better.''

 (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div><p/>Lying back on the sofa, she (<font color='blue'><b>Jo</b></font>) read the manuscript carefully through,
making dashes here and there, and putting in many exclamation points,
which looked like little balloons. Then she (<font color='blue'><b>Jo</b></font>) tied it up with a smart
red ribbon, and sat a minute looking at it with a sober, wistful
expression, which plainly showed how earnest her (<font color='blue'><b>Jo</b></font>) work had been. Jo's
desk up here was an old tin kitchen which hung against the wall. In it
she (<font color='blue'><b>Jo</b></font>) kept her (<font color='blue'><b>Jo</b></font>) papers, and a few books, safely shut away from Scrabble,
who, being likewise of a literary turn, was fond of making a
circulating library of such books as were left in his (<font color='blue'><b>Jo</b></font>) way by eating the
leaves. From this tin receptacle Jo produced another manuscript, and
putting both in her (<font color='blue'><b>Jo</b></font>) pocket, crept quietly downstairs, leaving her (<font color='blue'><b>Jo</b></font>)
friends to nibble on her (<font color='blue'><b>Jo</b></font>) pens and taste her (<font color='blue'><b>Jo</b></font>) ink.

<p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>Jo</b></font>) put on her (<font color='blue'><b>Jo</b></font>) hat and jacket as noiselessly as possible, and going to
the back entry window, got out upon the roof of a low porch, swung
herself down to the grassy bank, and took a roundabout way to the road.
Once there, she (<font color='blue'><b>Jo</b></font>) composed herself, hailed a passing omnibus, and rolled
away to town, looking very merry and mysterious.

<p/>If anyone had been watching her (<font color='blue'><b>Jo</b></font>), he (<font color='blue'><b>Jo</b></font>) would have thought her (<font color='blue'><b>Jo</b></font>) movements
decidedly peculiar, for on alighting, she (<font color='blue'><b>Jo</b></font>) went off at a great pace till
she (<font color='blue'><b>Jo</b></font>) reached a certain number in a certain busy street. Having found
the place with some difficulty, she (<font color='blue'><b>Jo</b></font>) went into the doorway, looked up
the dirty stairs, and after standing stock still a minute, suddenly
dived into the street and walked away as rapidly as she (<font color='blue'><b>Jo</b></font>) came. This
maneuver she (<font color='blue'><b>Jo</b></font>) repeated several times, to the great amusement of a
black-eyed young gentleman lounging in the window of a building
opposite. On returning for the third time, Jo gave herself a shake,
pulled her (<font color='blue'><b>Jo</b></font>) hat over her (<font color='blue'><b>Jo</b></font>) eyes, and walked up the stairs, looking as if
she (<font color='blue'><b>Jo</b></font>) were going to have all her (<font color='blue'><b>Jo</b></font>) teeth out.

<p/>There was a dentist's sign, among others, which adorned the entrance,
and after staring a moment at the pair of artificial jaws which slowly
opened and shut to draw attention to a fine set of teeth, the young
gentleman put on his (<font color='blue'><b>gentleman</b></font>) coat, took his (<font color='blue'><b>gentleman</b></font>) hat, and went down to post himself
in the opposite doorway, saying with a smile and a shiver, <div class="bookquote">``It's like
her (<font color='blue'><b>boys</b></font>) to come alone, but if she (<font color='blue'><b>boys</b></font>) has a bad time she (<font color='blue'><b>boys</b></font>)'ll need someone to
help her (<font color='blue'><b>boys</b></font>) home.''

 (<font color='red'><b>the gentleman</b></font>)</div><p/>In ten minutes Jo came running downstairs with a very red face and the
general appearance of a person who had just passed through a trying
ordeal of some sort. When she (<font color='blue'><b>Jo</b></font>) saw the young gentleman she (<font color='blue'><b>Jo</b></font>) looked
anything but pleased, and passed him (<font color='blue'><b>gentleman</b></font>) with a nod. But he (<font color='blue'><b>gentleman</b></font>) followed,
asking with an air of sympathy, <div class="bookquote">``Did you have a bad time?''

 (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Not very.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``You got through quickly.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Yes, thank goodness!''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Why did you go alone?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Didn't want anyone to know.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``You're the oddest fellow I ever saw. How many did you have out?''

 (<font color='red'><b>Jo/Miss Jo/JO</b></font>)</div><p/>Jo looked at her (<font color='blue'><b>Jo</b></font>) friend as if she (<font color='blue'><b>Jo</b></font>) did not understand him (<font color='blue'><b>friend</b></font>), then began to
laugh as if mightily amused at something.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``There are two which I want to have come out, but I must wait a week.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``What are you laughing at? You are up to some mischief, Jo,''  (<font color='red'><b>Laurie/Mr. Laurie/LAURIE</b></font>)</div>said
Laurie, looking mystified.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``So are you. What were you doing, sir, up in that billiard saloon?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Begging your pardon, ma'am, it wasn't a billiard saloon, but a
gymnasium, and I was taking a lesson in fencing.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I'm glad of that.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Why?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``You can teach me, and then when we play _Hamlet_, you can be Laertes,
and we'll make a fine thing of the fencing scene.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Laurie/Mr. Laurie/LAURIE</b></font>)</div><p/>Laurie burst out with a hearty boy's laugh, which made several
passers-by smile in spite of themselves.

<p/>``I'll teach you whether we play _Hamlet_ or not. It's grand fun and
will straighten you up capitally. But I don't believe that was your
only reason for saying <div class="bookquote">``I'm glad' in that decided way, was it now?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``No, I was glad that you were not in the saloon, because I hope you
never go to such places. Do you?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Not often.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I wish you wouldn't.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``It's no harm, Jo. I have billiards at home, but it's no fun unless
you have good players, so, as I'm fond of it, I come sometimes and have
a game with Ned Moffat or some of the other fellows.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Oh, dear, I'm so sorry, for you'll get to liking it better and better,
and will waste time and money, and grow like those dreadful boys. I
did hope you'd stay respectable and be a satisfaction to your friends,''
 (<font color='red'><b>Jo/Miss Jo/JO</b></font>)</div>said Jo, shaking her (<font color='blue'><b>Jo</b></font>) head.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Can't a fellow take a little innocent amusement now and then without
losing his (<font color='blue'><b>fellow</b></font>) respectability?''  (<font color='red'><b>Laurie/Mr. Laurie/LAURIE</b></font>)</div>asked Laurie, looking nettled.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``That depends upon how and where he (<font color='blue'><b>fellow</b></font>) takes it. I don't like Ned and his (<font color='blue'><b>Ned</b></font>)
set, and wish you'd keep out of it. Mother won't let us have him (<font color='blue'><b>Ned</b></font>) at
our house, though he (<font color='blue'><b>Ned</b></font>) wants to come. And if you grow like him (<font color='blue'><b>Ned</b></font>) she (<font color='blue'><b>Mother</b></font>) won't
be willing to have us frolic together as we do now.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Won't she (<font color='blue'><b>Mother</b></font>)?''  (<font color='red'><b>Laurie/Mr. Laurie/LAURIE</b></font>)</div>asked Laurie anxiously.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``No, she (<font color='blue'><b>Mother</b></font>) can't bear fashionable young men, and she (<font color='blue'><b>Mother</b></font>)'d shut us all up in
bandboxes rather than have us associate with them.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Well, she (<font color='blue'><b>Mother</b></font>) needn't get out her (<font color='blue'><b>Mother</b></font>) bandboxes yet. I'm not a fashionable
party and don't mean to be, but I do like harmless larks now and then,
don't you?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Yes, nobody minds them, so lark away, but don't get wild, will you?
Or there will be an end of all our good times.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I'll be a double distilled saint.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I can't bear saints. Just be a simple, honest, respectable boy, and
we'll never desert you. I don't know what I should do if you acted
like Mr. King's son. He (<font color='blue'><b>King</b></font>) had plenty of money, but didn't know how to
spend it, and got tipsy and gambled, and ran away, and forged his (<font color='blue'><b>King</b></font>)
father's name, I believe, and was altogether horrid.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``You think I'm likely to do the same? Much obliged.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``No, I don't--oh, dear, no!--but I hear people talking about money
being such a temptation, and I sometimes wish you were poor. I
shouldn't worry then.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Do you worry about me, Jo?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``A little, when you look moody and discontented, as you sometimes do,
for you've got such a strong will, if you once get started wrong, I'm
afraid it would be hard to stop you.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Laurie/Mr. Laurie/LAURIE</b></font>)</div><p/>Laurie walked in silence a few minutes, and Jo watched him (<font color='blue'><b>Laurie</b></font>), wishing she (<font color='blue'><b>Jo</b></font>)
had held her (<font color='blue'><b>Jo</b></font>) tongue, for his (<font color='blue'><b>Laurie</b></font>) eyes looked angry, though his (<font color='blue'><b>Laurie</b></font>) lips smiled
as if at her (<font color='blue'><b>Jo</b></font>) warnings.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Are you going to deliver lectures all the way home?''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Laurie</b></font>) asked
presently.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Of course not. Why?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Because if you are, I'll take a bus. If you're not, I'd like to walk
with you and tell you something very interesting.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I won't preach any more, and I'd like to hear the news immensely.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Very well, then, come on. It's a secret, and if I tell you, you must
tell me yours.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I haven't got any,''  (<font color='red'><b>Jo/Miss Jo/JO</b></font>)</div>began Jo, but stopped suddenly, remembering that
she (<font color='blue'><b>Jo</b></font>) had.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``You know you have--you can't hide anything, so up and `fess, or I
won't tell,''  (<font color='red'><b>Laurie/Mr. Laurie/LAURIE</b></font>)</div>cried Laurie.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Is your secret a nice one?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Oh, isn't it! All about people you know, and such fun! You ought to
hear it, and I've been aching to tell it this long time. Come, you
begin.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``You'll not say anything about it at home, will you?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Not a word.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``And you won't tease me in private?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I never tease.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Yes, you do. You get everything you want out of people. I don't know
how you do it, but you are a born wheedler.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Thank you. Fire away.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Well, I've left two stories with a newspaperman, and he (<font color='blue'><b>newspaperman</b></font>)'s to give his (<font color='blue'><b>newspaperman</b></font>)
answer next week,''  (<font color='red'><b>Jo/Miss Jo/JO</b></font>)</div>whispered Jo, in her (<font color='blue'><b>Jo</b></font>) confidant's ear.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Hurrah for Miss March, the celebrated American authoress!''  (<font color='red'><b>Laurie/Mr. Laurie/LAURIE</b></font>)</div>cried
Laurie, throwing up his (<font color='blue'><b>Laurie</b></font>) hat and catching it again, to the great delight
of two ducks, four cats, five hens, and half a dozen Irish children,
for they were out of the city now.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Hush! It won't come to anything, I dare say, but I couldn't rest till
I had tried, and I said nothing about it because I didn't want anyone
else to be disappointed.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``It won't fail. Why, Jo, your stories are works of Shakespeare
compared to half the rubbish that is published every day. Won't it be
fun to see them in print, and shan't we feel proud of our authoress?''

 (<font color='red'><b>Jo/Miss Jo/JO</b></font>)</div><p/>Jo's eyes sparkled, for it is always pleasant to be believed in, and a
friend's praise is always sweeter than a dozen newspaper puffs.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Where's your secret? Play fair, Teddy, or I'll never believe you
again,''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Jo</b></font>) said, trying to extinguish the brilliant hopes that blazed
up at a word of encouragement.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``I may get into a scrape for telling, but I didn't promise not to, so I
will, for I never feel easy in my mind till I've told you any plummy
bit of news I get. I know where Meg's glove is.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Is that all?''  (<font color='red'><b>Jo/Miss Jo/JO</b></font>)</div>said Jo, looking disappointed, as Laurie nodded and
twinkled with a face full of mysterious intelligence.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``It's quite enough for the present, as you'll agree when I tell you
where it is.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Tell, then.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Laurie/Mr. Laurie/LAURIE</b></font>)</div><p/>Laurie bent, and whispered three words in Jo's ear, which produced a
comical change. She (<font color='blue'><b>Jo</b></font>) stood and stared at him (<font color='blue'><b>Laurie</b></font>) for a minute, looking both
surprised and displeased, then walked on, saying sharply, <div class="bookquote">``How do you
know?''

 (<font color='red'><b>him</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Saw it.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Where?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Pocket.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``All this time?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Yes, isn't that romantic?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``No, it's horrid.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Don't you like it?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Of course I don't. It's ridiculous, it won't be allowed. My
patience! What would Meg say?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``You are not to tell anyone. Mind that.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I didn't promise.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``That was understood, and I trusted you.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Well, I won't for the present, anyway, but I'm disgusted, and wish you
hadn't told me.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I thought you'd be pleased.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``At the idea of anybody coming to take Meg away? No, thank you.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``You'll feel better about it when somebody comes to take you away.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I'd like to see anyone try it,''  (<font color='red'><b>Jo/Miss Jo/JO</b></font>)</div>cried Jo fiercely.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``So should I!''  (<font color='red'><b>Laurie/Mr. Laurie/LAURIE</b></font>)</div>and Laurie chuckled at the idea.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``I don't think secrets agree with me, I feel rumpled up in my mind
since you told me that,''  (<font color='red'><b>Jo/Miss Jo/JO</b></font>)</div>said Jo rather ungratefully.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Race down this hill with me, and you'll be all right,''  (<font color='red'><b>Laurie/Mr. Laurie/LAURIE</b></font>)</div>suggested
Laurie.

<p/>No one was in sight, the smooth road sloped invitingly before her (<font color='blue'><b>Jo</b></font>), and
finding the temptation irresistible, Jo darted away, soon leaving hat
and comb behind her (<font color='blue'><b>Jo</b></font>) and scattering hairpins as she (<font color='blue'><b>Jo</b></font>) ran. Laurie reached
the goal first and was quite satisfied with the success of his (<font color='blue'><b>Laurie</b></font>)
treatment, for his (<font color='blue'><b>Laurie</b></font>) Atlanta came panting up with flying hair, bright
eyes, ruddy cheeks, and no signs of dissatisfaction in her (<font color='blue'><b>Jo</b></font>) face.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``I wish I was a horse, then I could run for miles in this splendid air,
and not lose my breath. It was capital, but see what a guy it's made
me. Go, pick up my things, like a cherub, as you are,''  (<font color='red'><b>Jo/Miss Jo/JO</b></font>)</div>said Jo,
dropping down under a maple tree, which was carpeting the bank with
crimson leaves.

<p/>Laurie leisurely departed to recover the lost property, and Jo bundled
up her (<font color='blue'><b>Jo</b></font>) braids, hoping no one would pass by till she (<font color='blue'><b>Jo</b></font>) was tidy again.
But someone did pass, and who should it be but Meg, looking
particularly ladylike in her (<font color='blue'><b>Meg</b></font>) state and festival suit, for she (<font color='blue'><b>Meg</b></font>) had been
making calls.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``What in the world are you doing here?''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Meg</b></font>) asked, regarding her (<font color='blue'><b>Meg</b></font>)
disheveled sister with well-bred surprise.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Getting leaves,''  (<font color='red'><b>Jo/Miss Jo/JO</b></font>)</div>meekly answered Jo, sorting the rosy handful she (<font color='blue'><b>Jo</b></font>) had
just swept up.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``And hairpins,''  (<font color='red'><b>Laurie/Mr. Laurie/LAURIE</b></font>)</div>added Laurie, throwing half a dozen into Jo's lap.
<div class="bookquote">``They grow on this road, Meg, so do combs and brown straw hats.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``You have been running, Jo. How could you? When will you stop such
romping ways?''  (<font color='red'><b>Meg</b></font>)</div>said Meg reprovingly, as she (<font color='blue'><b>Meg</b></font>) settled her (<font color='blue'><b>Meg</b></font>) cuffs and
smoothed her (<font color='blue'><b>Meg</b></font>) hair, with which the wind had taken liberties.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Never till I'm stiff and old and have to use a crutch. Don't try to
make me grow up before my time, Meg. It's hard enough to have you
change all of a sudden. Let me be a little girl as long as I can.''

 (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div><p/>As she (<font color='blue'><b>Meg</b></font>) spoke, Jo bent over the leaves to hide the trembling of her (<font color='blue'><b>Jo</b></font>)
lips, for lately she (<font color='blue'><b>Jo</b></font>) had felt that Margaret was fast getting to be a
woman, and Laurie's secret made her (<font color='blue'><b>Margaret</b></font>) dread the separation which must
surely come some time and now seemed very near. He (<font color='blue'><b>Laurie</b></font>) saw the trouble in
her (<font color='blue'><b>Margaret</b></font>) face and drew Meg's attention from it by asking quickly, <div class="bookquote">``Where
have you been calling, all so fine?''

 (<font color='red'><b>Meg</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``At the Gardiners', and Sallie has been telling me all about Belle
Moffat's wedding. It was very splendid, and they have gone to spend
the winter in Paris. Just think how delightful that must be!''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Do you envy her (<font color='blue'><b>Belle</b></font>), Meg?''  (<font color='red'><b>Laurie/Mr. Laurie/LAURIE</b></font>)</div>said Laurie.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``I'm afraid I do.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I'm glad of it!''  (<font color='red'><b>Jo/Miss Jo/JO</b></font>)</div>muttered Jo, tying on her (<font color='blue'><b>Jo</b></font>) hat with a jerk.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Why?''  (<font color='red'><b>Meg</b></font>)</div>asked Meg, looking surprised.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Because if you care much about riches, you will never go and marry a
poor man,''  (<font color='red'><b>Jo/Miss Jo/JO</b></font>)</div>said Jo, frowning at Laurie, who was mutely warning her (<font color='blue'><b>Jo</b></font>) to
mind what she (<font color='blue'><b>Jo</b></font>) said.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``I shall never '_go_ and marry' anyone,''  (<font color='red'><b>Meg</b></font>)</div>observed Meg, walking on with
great dignity while the others followed, laughing, whispering, skipping
stones, and `behaving like children', as Meg said to herself, though
she (<font color='blue'><b>Meg</b></font>) might have been tempted to join them if she (<font color='blue'><b>Meg</b></font>) had not had her (<font color='blue'><b>Meg</b></font>) best
dress on.

<p/>For a week or two, Jo behaved so queerly that her (<font color='blue'><b>Jo</b></font>) sisters were quite
bewildered. She (<font color='blue'><b>Jo</b></font>) rushed to the door when the postman rang, was rude to
Mr. Brooke whenever they met, would sit looking at Meg with a
woe-begone face, occasionally jumping up to shake and then kiss her (<font color='blue'><b>Meg</b></font>) in
a very mysterious manner. Laurie and she (<font color='blue'><b>Meg</b></font>) were always making signs to
one another, and talking about ``Spread Eagles' till the girls declared
they had both lost their wits. On the second Saturday after Jo got out
of the window, Meg, as she (<font color='blue'><b>Meg</b></font>) sat sewing at her (<font color='blue'><b>Meg</b></font>) window, was scandalized by
the sight of Laurie chasing Jo all over the garden and finally
capturing her (<font color='blue'><b>Jo</b></font>) in Amy's bower. What went on there, Meg could not see,
but shrieks of laughter were heard, followed by the murmur of voices
and a great flapping of newspapers.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``What shall we do with that girl? She (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) never _will_ behave like a young
lady,''  (<font color='red'><b>Meg</b></font>)</div>sighed Meg, as she (<font color='blue'><b>Meg</b></font>) watched the race with a disapproving face.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``I hope she (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) won't. She (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) is so funny and dear as she (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) is,''  (<font color='red'><b>Beth</b></font>)</div>said Beth, who
had never betrayed that she (<font color='blue'><b>Beth</b></font>) was a little hurt at Jo's having secrets
with anyone but her (<font color='blue'><b>Jo</b></font>).

<p/><div class="bookquote">``It's very trying, but we never can make her (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) _commy la fo_,''  (<font color='red'><b>Amy/Amy March</b></font>)</div>added Amy,
who sat making some new frills for herself, with her (<font color='blue'><b>Amy</b></font>) curls tied up in a
very becoming way, two agreeable things that made her (<font color='blue'><b>Amy</b></font>) feel unusually
elegant and ladylike.

<p/>In a few minutes Jo bounced in, laid herself on the sofa, and affected
to read.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Have you anything interesting there?''  (<font color='red'><b>Meg</b></font>)</div>asked Meg, with condescension.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Nothing but a story, won't amount to much, I guess,''  (<font color='red'><b>Jo/Miss Jo/JO</b></font>)</div>returned Jo,
carefully keeping the name of the paper out of sight.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``You'd better read it aloud. That will amuse us and keep you out of
mischief,''  (<font color='red'><b>Amy/Amy March</b></font>)</div>said Amy in her (<font color='blue'><b>Amy</b></font>) most grown-up tone.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``What's the name?''  (<font color='red'><b>Beth</b></font>)</div>asked Beth, wondering why Jo kept her (<font color='blue'><b>Jo</b></font>) face behind
the sheet.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``The Rival Painters.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``That sounds well. Read it,''  (<font color='red'><b>Meg</b></font>)</div>said Meg.

<p/>With a loud <div class="bookquote">``Hem!''  (<font color='red'><b>Jo/Miss Jo/JO</b></font>)</div>and a long breath, Jo began to read very fast. The
girls listened with interest, for the tale was romantic, and somewhat
pathetic, as most of the characters died in the end. <div class="bookquote">``I like that about
the splendid picture,''  (<font color='red'><b>Amy/Amy March</b></font>)</div>was Amy's approving remark, as Jo paused.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``I prefer the lovering part. Viola and Angelo are two of our favorite
names, isn't that queer?''  (<font color='red'><b>Meg</b></font>)</div>said Meg, wiping her (<font color='blue'><b>Meg</b></font>) eyes, for the lovering
part was tragical.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Who wrote it?''  (<font color='red'><b>Beth</b></font>)</div>asked Beth, who had caught a glimpse of Jo's face.

<p/>The reader suddenly sat up, cast away the paper, displaying a flushed
countenance, and with a funny mixture of solemnity and excitement
replied in a loud voice, <div class="bookquote">``Your sister.''

 (<font color='red'><b>The reader</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``You?''  (<font color='red'><b>Meg</b></font>)</div>cried Meg, dropping her (<font color='blue'><b>Meg</b></font>) work.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``It's very good,''  (<font color='red'><b>Amy/Amy March</b></font>)</div>said Amy critically.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``I knew it! I knew it! Oh, my Jo, I am so proud!''  (<font color='red'><b>Beth</b></font>)</div>and Beth ran to hug
her (<font color='blue'><b>Beth</b></font>) sister and exult over this splendid success.

<p/>Dear me, how delighted they all were, to be sure! How Meg wouldn't
believe it till she (<font color='blue'><b>Meg</b></font>) saw the words. <div class="bookquote">``Miss Josephine March,''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>actually
printed in the paper. How graciously Amy criticized the artistic parts
of the story, and offered hints for a sequel, which unfortunately
couldn't be carried out, as the hero and heroine were dead. How Beth
got excited, and skipped and sang with joy. How Hannah came in to
exclaim, <div class="bookquote">``Sakes alive, well I never!''  (<font color='red'><b>Hannah</b></font>)</div>in great astonishment at `that
Jo's doin's'. How proud Mrs. March was when she (<font color='blue'><b>Jo</b></font>) knew it. How Jo
laughed, with tears in her (<font color='blue'><b>Jo</b></font>) eyes, as she (<font color='blue'><b>Jo</b></font>) declared she (<font color='blue'><b>Jo</b></font>) might as well be a
peacock and done with it, and how the ``Spread Eagle' might be said to
flap his (<font color='blue'><b>Angelo</b></font>) wings triumphantly over the House of March, as the paper
passed from hand to hand.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Tell us about it.''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``When did it come?''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``How much did you get for it?''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``What will Father say?''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``Won't Laurie laugh?''  (<font color='red'><b>the family all</b></font>)</div>cried the family, all in
one breath as they clustered about Jo, for these foolish, affectionate
people made a jubilee of every little household joy.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Stop jabbering, girls, and I'll tell you everything,''  (<font color='red'><b>Jo/Miss Jo/JO</b></font>)</div>said Jo,
wondering if Miss Burney felt any grander over her (<font color='blue'><b>Jo</b></font>) Evelina than she (<font color='blue'><b>Jo</b></font>) did
over her (<font color='blue'><b>Jo</b></font>) ``Rival Painters'. Having told how she (<font color='blue'><b>Josephine</b></font>) disposed of her (<font color='blue'><b>Josephine</b></font>) tales,
Jo added, <div class="bookquote">``And when I went to get my answer, the man said he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) liked them
both, but didn't pay beginners, only let them print in his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) paper, and
noticed the stories. It was good practice, he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) said, and when the
beginners improved, anyone would pay. So I let him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) have the two
stories, and today this was sent to me, and Laurie caught me with it
and insisted on seeing it, so I let him (<font color='blue'><b>Laurie</b></font>). And he (<font color='blue'><b>Laurie</b></font>) said it was good, and
I shall write more, and he (<font color='blue'><b>Laurie</b></font>)'s going to get the next paid for, and I am
so happy, for in time I may be able to support myself and help the
girls.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Jo/Miss Jo/JO</b></font>)</div><p/>Jo's breath gave out here, and wrapping her (<font color='blue'><b>Jo</b></font>) head in the paper, she (<font color='blue'><b>Jo</b></font>)
bedewed her (<font color='blue'><b>Jo</b></font>) little story with a few natural tears, for to be
independent and earn the praise of those she (<font color='blue'><b>Jo</b></font>) loved were the dearest
wishes of her (<font color='blue'><b>Jo</b></font>) heart, and this seemed to be the first step toward that
happy end.



<p/>CHAPTER FIFTEEN

<p/>A TELEGRAM

<p/><div class="bookquote">``November is the most disagreeable month in the whole year,''  (<font color='red'><b>Margaret/Miss Margaret</b></font>)</div>said
Margaret, standing at the window one dull afternoon, looking out at the
frostbitten garden.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``That's the reason I was born in it,''  (<font color='red'><b>Jo/Miss Jo/JO</b></font>)</div>observed Jo pensively, quite
unconscious of the blot on her (<font color='blue'><b>Jo</b></font>) nose.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``If something very pleasant should happen now, we should think it a
delightful month,''  (<font color='red'><b>Beth</b></font>)</div>said Beth, who took a hopeful view of everything,
even November.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``I dare say, but nothing pleasant ever does happen in this family,''
 (<font color='red'><b>Meg</b></font>)</div>said Meg, who was out of sorts. <div class="bookquote">``We go grubbing along day after day,
without a bit of change, and very little fun. We might as well be in a
treadmill.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``My patience, how blue we are!''  (<font color='red'><b>Jo/Miss Jo/JO</b></font>)</div>cried Jo. <div class="bookquote">``I don't much wonder, poor
dear, for you see other girls having splendid times, while you grind,
grind, year in and year out. Oh, don't I wish I could manage things
for you as I do for my heroines! You're pretty enough and good enough
already, so I'd have some rich relation leave you a fortune
unexpectedly. Then you'd dash out as an heiress, scorn everyone who
has slighted you, go abroad, and come home my Lady Something in a blaze
of splendor and elegance.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``People don't have fortunes left them in that style nowadays, men have
to work and women marry for money. It's a dreadfully unjust world,''
 (<font color='red'><b>Meg</b></font>)</div>said Meg bitterly.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Jo and I are going to make fortunes for you all. Just wait ten years,
and see if we don't,''  (<font color='red'><b>Amy/Amy March</b></font>)</div>said Amy, who sat in a corner making mud pies, as
Hannah called her (<font color='blue'><b>Hannah</b></font>) little clay models of birds, fruit, and faces.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Can't wait, and I'm afraid I haven't much faith in ink and dirt,
though I'm grateful for your good intentions.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Meg</b></font>)</div><p/>Meg sighed, and turned to the frostbitten garden again. Jo groaned and
leaned both elbows on the table in a despondent attitude, but Amy
spatted away energetically, and Beth, who sat at the other window,
said, smiling, <div class="bookquote">``Two pleasant things are going to happen right away.
Marmee is coming down the street, and Laurie is tramping through the
garden as if he (<font color='blue'><b>Laurie</b></font>) had something nice to tell.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Beth</b></font>)</div><p/>In they both came, Mrs. March with her (<font color='blue'><b>Beth</b></font>) usual question, <div class="bookquote">``Any letter from
Father, girls?''  (<font color='red'><b>Laurie/Mr. Laurie/LAURIE</b></font>)</div>and Laurie to say in his (<font color='blue'><b>Laurie</b></font>) persuasive way, <div class="bookquote">``Won't some of
you come for a drive? I've been working away at mathematics till my
head is in a muddle, and I'm going to freshen my wits by a brisk turn.
It's a dull day, but the air isn't bad, and I'm going to take Brooke
home, so it will be gay inside, if it isn't out. Come, Jo, you and
Beth will go, won't you?''

 (<font color='red'><b>Laurie/Mr. Laurie/LAURIE</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Of course we will.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Much obliged, but I'm busy.''  (<font color='red'><b>Meg</b></font>)</div>And Meg whisked out her (<font color='blue'><b>Meg</b></font>) workbasket, for
she (<font color='blue'><b>Meg</b></font>) had agreed with her (<font color='blue'><b>Meg</b></font>) mother that it was best, for her (<font color='blue'><b>Meg</b></font>) at least, not
to drive too often with the young gentleman.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``We three will be ready in a minute,''  (<font color='red'><b>Amy/Amy March</b></font>)</div>cried Amy, running away to wash
her (<font color='blue'><b>Amy</b></font>) hands.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Can I do anything for you, Madam Mother?''  (<font color='red'><b>Laurie/Mr. Laurie/LAURIE</b></font>)</div>asked Laurie, leaning over
Mrs. March's chair with the affectionate look and tone he (<font color='blue'><b>Laurie</b></font>) always gave
her (<font color='blue'><b>Amy</b></font>).

<p/><div class="bookquote">``No, thank you, except call at the office, if you'll be so kind, dear.
It's our day for a letter, and the postman hasn't been. Father is as
regular as the sun, but there's some delay on the way, perhaps.''

 (<font color='red'><b>her</b></font>)</div><p/>A sharp ring interrupted her (<font color='blue'><b>Amy</b></font>), and a minute after Hannah came in with a
letter.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``It's one of them horrid telegraph things, mum,''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Hannah</b></font>) said, handling it
as if she (<font color='blue'><b>Hannah</b></font>) was afraid it would explode and do some damage.

<p/>At the word `telegraph', Mrs. March snatched it, read the two lines it
contained, and dropped back into her (<font color='blue'><b>Hannah</b></font>) chair as white as if the little
paper had sent a bullet to her (<font color='blue'><b>Hannah</b></font>) heart. Laurie dashed downstairs for
water, while Meg and Hannah supported her (<font color='blue'><b>Meg</b></font>), and Jo read aloud, in a
frightened voice...

<p/>Mrs. March:
Your husband is very ill. Come at once.
S. HALE
Blank Hospital, Washington.

<p/>How still the room was as they listened breathlessly, how strangely the
day darkened outside, and how suddenly the whole world seemed to
change, as the girls gathered about their mother, feeling as if all the
happiness and support of their lives was about to be taken from them.

<p/>Mrs. March was herself again directly, read the message over, and
stretched out her (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) arms to her (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) daughters, saying, in a tone they never
forgot, <div class="bookquote">``I shall go at once, but it may be too late. Oh, children,
children, help me to bear it!''

 (<font color='red'><b>daughters</b></font>)</div><p/>For several minutes there was nothing but the sound of sobbing in the
room, mingled with broken words of comfort, tender assurances of help,
and hopeful whispers that died away in tears. Poor Hannah was the
first to recover, and with unconscious wisdom she (<font color='blue'><b>Hannah</b></font>) set all the rest a
good example, for with her (<font color='blue'><b>Hannah</b></font>), work was panacea for most afflictions.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``The Lord keep the dear man! I won't waste no time a-cryin', but git
your things ready right away, mum,''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Hannah</b></font>) said heartily, as she (<font color='blue'><b>Hannah</b></font>) wiped her (<font color='blue'><b>Hannah</b></font>)
face on her (<font color='blue'><b>Hannah</b></font>) apron, gave her (<font color='blue'><b>Hannah</b></font>) mistress a warm shake of the hand with her (<font color='blue'><b>Hannah</b></font>)
own hard one, and went away to work like three women in one.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``She (<font color='blue'><b>mum</b></font>)'s right, there's no time for tears now. Be calm, girls, and let
me think.''

 (<font color='red'><b>mother</b></font>)</div><p/>They tried to be calm, poor things, as their mother sat up, looking
pale but steady, and put away her (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) grief to think and plan for them.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Where's Laurie?''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) asked presently, when she (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) had collected her (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>)
thoughts and decided on the first duties to be done.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Here, ma'am. Oh, let me do something!''  (<font color='red'><b>the boy</b></font>)</div>cried the boy, hurrying from
the next room whither he (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>) had withdrawn, feeling that their first sorrow
was too sacred for even his (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>) friendly eyes to see.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Send a telegram saying I will come at once. The next train goes early
in the morning. I'll take that.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``What else? The horses are ready. I can go anywhere, do anything,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>)
said, looking ready to fly to the ends of the earth.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Leave a note at Aunt March's. Jo, give me that pen and paper.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Jo/Miss Jo/JO</b></font>)</div><p/>Tearing off the blank side of one of her (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) newly copied pages, Jo drew
the table before her (<font color='blue'><b>Jo</b></font>) mother, well knowing that money for the long, sad
journey must be borrowed, and feeling as if she (<font color='blue'><b>Jo</b></font>) could do anything to
add a little to the sum for her (<font color='blue'><b>Jo</b></font>) father.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Now go, dear, but don't kill yourself driving at a desperate pace.
There is no need of that.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Laurie/Mr. Laurie/LAURIE</b></font>)</div><p/>Mrs. March's warning was evidently thrown away, for five minutes later
Laurie tore by the window on his (<font color='blue'><b>Laurie</b></font>) own fleet horse, riding as if for his (<font color='blue'><b>Laurie</b></font>)
life.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Jo, run to the rooms, and tell Mrs. King that I can't come. On the way
get these things. I'll put them down, they'll be needed and I must go
prepared for nursing. Hospital stores are not always good. Beth, go
and ask Mr. Laurence for a couple of bottles of old wine. I'm not too
proud to beg for Father. He (<font color='blue'><b>Father</b></font>) shall have the best of everything. Amy,
tell Hannah to get down the black trunk, and Meg, come and help me find
my things, for I'm half bewildered.''

 (<font color='red'><b>the lady</b></font>)</div><p/>Writing, thinking, and directing all at once might well bewilder the
poor lady, and Meg begged her (<font color='blue'><b>Meg</b></font>) to sit quietly in her (<font color='blue'><b>Meg</b></font>) room for a little
while, and let them work. Everyone scattered like leaves before a gust
of wind, and the quiet, happy household was broken up as suddenly as if
the paper had been an evil spell.

<p/>Mr. Laurence came hurrying back with Beth, bringing every comfort the
kind old gentleman could think of for the invalid, and friendliest
promises of protection for the girls during the mother's absence, which
comforted her (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) very much. There was nothing he (<font color='blue'><b>gentleman</b></font>) didn't offer, from his (<font color='blue'><b>gentleman</b></font>)
own dressing gown to himself as escort. But the last was impossible.
Mrs. March would not hear of the old gentleman's undertaking the long
journey, yet an expression of relief was visible when he (<font color='blue'><b>gentleman</b></font>) spoke of it,
for anxiety ill fits one for traveling. He (<font color='blue'><b>gentleman</b></font>) saw the look, knit his (<font color='blue'><b>gentleman</b></font>) heavy
eyebrows, rubbed his (<font color='blue'><b>gentleman</b></font>) hands, and marched abruptly away, saying he (<font color='blue'><b>gentleman</b></font>)'d be
back directly. No one had time to think of him (<font color='blue'><b>gentleman</b></font>) again till, as Meg ran
through the entry, with a pair of rubbers in one hand and a cup of tea
in the other, she (<font color='blue'><b>Meg</b></font>) came suddenly upon Mr. Brooke.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``I'm very sorry to hear of this, Miss March,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Brooke</b></font>) said, in the kind,
quiet tone which sounded very pleasantly to her (<font color='blue'><b>Meg</b></font>) perturbed spirit. <div class="bookquote">``I
came to offer myself as escort to your mother. Mr. Laurence has
commissions for me in Washington, and it will give me real satisfaction
to be of service to her (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) there.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Meg</b></font>)</div><p/>Down dropped the rubbers, and the tea was very near following, as Meg
put out her (<font color='blue'><b>Meg</b></font>) hand, with a face so full of gratitude that Mr. Brooke
would have felt repaid for a much greater sacrifice than the trifling
one of time and comfort which he (<font color='blue'><b>Brooke</b></font>) was about to take.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``How kind you all are! Mother will accept, I'm sure, and it will be
such a relief to know that she (<font color='blue'><b>Mother</b></font>) has someone to take care of her (<font color='blue'><b>Mother</b></font>). Thank
you very, very much!''

 (<font color='red'><b>Meg</b></font>)</div><p/>Meg spoke earnestly, and forgot herself entirely till something in the
brown eyes looking down at her (<font color='blue'><b>Meg</b></font>) made her (<font color='blue'><b>Meg</b></font>) remember the cooling tea, and
lead the way into the parlor, saying she (<font color='blue'><b>Meg</b></font>) would call her (<font color='blue'><b>Meg</b></font>) mother.

<p/>Everything was arranged by the time Laurie returned with a note from
Aunt March, enclosing the desired sum, and a few lines repeating what
she (<font color='blue'><b>Aunt</b></font>) had often said before, that she (<font color='blue'><b>Aunt</b></font>) had always told them it was absurd
for March to go into the army, always predicted that no good would come
of it, and she (<font color='blue'><b>Aunt</b></font>) hoped they would take her (<font color='blue'><b>Aunt</b></font>) advice the next time. Mrs.
March put the note in the fire, the money in her (<font color='blue'><b>Aunt</b></font>) purse, and went on
with her (<font color='blue'><b>Aunt</b></font>) preparations, with her (<font color='blue'><b>Aunt</b></font>) lips folded tightly in a way which Jo
would have understood if she (<font color='blue'><b>Jo</b></font>) had been there.

<p/>The short afternoon wore away. All other errands were done, and Meg
and her (<font color='blue'><b>Meg</b></font>) mother busy at some necessary needlework, while Beth and Amy
got tea, and Hannah finished her (<font color='blue'><b>Hannah</b></font>) ironing with what she (<font color='blue'><b>Hannah</b></font>) called a `slap
and a bang', but still Jo did not come. They began to get anxious, and
Laurie went off to find her (<font color='blue'><b>Jo</b></font>), for no one knew what freak Jo might take
into her (<font color='blue'><b>Jo</b></font>) head. He (<font color='blue'><b>Laurie</b></font>) missed her (<font color='blue'><b>Jo</b></font>), however, and she (<font color='blue'><b>Jo</b></font>) came walking in with a
very queer expression of countenance, for there was a mixture of fun
and fear, satisfaction and regret in it, which puzzled the family as
much as did the roll of bills she (<font color='blue'><b>Jo</b></font>) laid before her (<font color='blue'><b>Jo</b></font>) mother, saying with a
little choke in her (<font color='blue'><b>Jo</b></font>) voice, <div class="bookquote">``That's my contribution toward making Father
comfortable and bringing him (<font color='blue'><b>Father</b></font>) home!''

 (<font color='red'><b>mother</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``My dear, where did you get it? Twenty-five dollars! Jo, I hope you
haven't done anything rash?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``No, it's mine honestly. I didn't beg, borrow, or steal it. I earned
it, and I don't think you'll blame me, for I only sold what was my own.''

 (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div><p/>As she (<font color='blue'><b>Jo</b></font>) spoke, Jo took off her (<font color='blue'><b>Jo</b></font>) bonnet, and a general outcry arose, for
all her (<font color='blue'><b>Jo</b></font>) abundant hair was cut short.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Your hair! Your beautiful hair!''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``Oh, Jo, how could you? Your one
beauty.''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``My dear girl, there was no need of this.''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``She (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) doesn't look
like my Jo any more, but I love her (<font color='blue'><b>Jo</b></font>) dearly for it!''

 (<font color='red'><b>everyone</b></font>)</div><p/>As everyone exclaimed, and Beth hugged the cropped head tenderly, Jo
assumed an indifferent air, which did not deceive anyone a particle,
and said, rumpling up the brown bush and trying to look as if she (<font color='blue'><b>Jo</b></font>) liked
it, <div class="bookquote">``It doesn't affect the fate of the nation, so don't wail, Beth. It
will be good for my vanity, I was getting too proud of my wig. It will
do my brains good to have that mop taken off. My head feels
deliciously light and cool, and the barber said I could soon have a
curly crop, which will be boyish, becoming, and easy to keep in order.
I'm satisfied, so please take the money and let's have supper.''

 (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Tell me all about it, Jo. I am not quite satisfied, but I can't blame
you, for I know how willingly you sacrificed your vanity, as you call
it, to your love. But, my dear, it was not necessary, and I'm afraid
you will regret it one of these days,''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>said Mrs. March.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``No, I won't!''  (<font color='red'><b>Jo/Miss Jo/JO</b></font>)</div>returned Jo stoutly, feeling much relieved that her (<font color='blue'><b>Jo</b></font>)
prank was not entirely condemned.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``What made you do it?''  (<font color='red'><b>Amy/Amy March</b></font>)</div>asked Amy, who would as soon have thought of
cutting off her (<font color='blue'><b>Amy</b></font>) head as her (<font color='blue'><b>Amy</b></font>) pretty hair.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Well, I was wild to do something for Father,''  (<font color='red'><b>Jo/Miss Jo/JO</b></font>)</div>replied Jo, as they
gathered about the table, for healthy young people can eat even in the
midst of trouble. <div class="bookquote">``I hate to borrow as much as Mother does, and I knew
Aunt March would croak, she (<font color='blue'><b>Aunt</b></font>) always does, if you ask for a ninepence.
Meg gave all her (<font color='blue'><b>Meg</b></font>) quarterly salary toward the rent, and I only got some
clothes with mine, so I felt wicked, and was bound to have some money,
if I sold the nose off my face to get it.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``You needn't feel wicked, my child! You had no winter things and got
the simplest with your own hard earnings,''  (<font color='red'><b>Jo/Miss Jo/JO</b></font>)</div>said Mrs. March with a look
that warmed Jo's heart.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``I hadn't the least idea of selling my hair at first, but as I went
along I kept thinking what I could do, and feeling as if I'd like to
dive into some of the rich stores and help myself. In a barber's
window I saw tails of hair with the prices marked, and one black tail,
not so thick as mine, was forty dollars. It came to me all of a sudden
that I had one thing to make money out of, and without stopping to
think, I walked in, asked if they bought hair, and what they would give
for mine.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I don't see how you dared to do it,''  (<font color='red'><b>Beth</b></font>)</div>said Beth in a tone of awe.

<p/>``Oh, he (<font color='blue'><b>barber</b></font>) was a little man who looked as if he (<font color='blue'><b>barber</b></font>) merely lived to oil his (<font color='blue'><b>barber</b></font>)
hair. He (<font color='blue'><b>barber</b></font>) rather stared at first, as if he (<font color='blue'><b>barber</b></font>) wasn't used to having girls
bounce into his (<font color='blue'><b>barber</b></font>) shop and ask him (<font color='blue'><b>barber</b></font>) to buy their hair. He (<font color='blue'><b>barber</b></font>) said he (<font color='blue'><b>barber</b></font>) didn't
care about mine, it wasn't the fashionable color, and he (<font color='blue'><b>barber</b></font>) never paid
much for it in the first place. The work put into it made it dear, and
so on. It was getting late, and I was afraid if it wasn't done right
away that I shouldn't have it done at all, and you know when I start to
do a thing, I hate to give it up. So I begged him (<font color='blue'><b>barber</b></font>) to take it, and told
him (<font color='blue'><b>barber</b></font>) why I was in such a hurry. It was silly, I dare say, but it
changed his (<font color='blue'><b>barber</b></font>) mind, for I got rather excited, and told the story in my
topsy-turvy way, and his (<font color='blue'><b>barber</b></font>) wife heard, and said so kindly, <div class="bookquote">``Take it,
Thomas, and oblige the young lady. I'd do as much for our Jimmy any
day if I had a spire of hair worth selling.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Who was Jimmy?''  (<font color='red'><b>Amy/Amy March</b></font>)</div>asked Amy, who liked to have things explained as they
went along.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Her (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) son, she (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) said, who was in the army. How friendly such things make
strangers feel, don't they? She (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) talked away all the time the man
clipped, and diverted my mind nicely.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Didn't you feel dreadfully when the first cut came?''  (<font color='red'><b>Meg</b></font>)</div>asked Meg, with a
shiver.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``I took a last look at my hair while the man got his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) things, and that
was the end of it. I never snivel over trifles like that. I will
confess, though, I felt queer when I saw the dear old hair laid out on
the table, and felt only the short rough ends of my head. It almost
seemed as if I'd an arm or leg off. The woman saw me look at it, and
picked out a long lock for me to keep. I'll give it to you, Marmee,
just to remember past glories by, for a crop is so comfortable I don't
think I shall ever have a mane again.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/>Mrs. March folded the wavy chestnut lock, and laid it away with a short
gray one in her (<font color='blue'><b>Meg</b></font>) desk. She (<font color='blue'><b>Meg</b></font>) only said, <div class="bookquote">``Thank you, deary,''  (<font color='red'><b>She</b></font>)</div>but something
in her (<font color='blue'><b>Meg</b></font>) face made the girls change the subject, and talk as cheerfully
as they could about Mr. Brooke's kindness, the prospect of a fine day
tomorrow, and the happy times they would have when Father came home to
be nursed.

<p/>No one wanted to go to bed when at ten o'clock Mrs. March put by the
last finished job, and said, <div class="bookquote">``Come girls.''  (<font color='red'><b>Beth</b></font>)</div>Beth went to the piano and
played the father's favorite hymn. All began bravely, but broke down
one by one till Beth was left alone, singing with all her (<font color='blue'><b>Beth</b></font>) heart, for to
her (<font color='blue'><b>Beth</b></font>) music was always a sweet consoler.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Go to bed and don't talk, for we must be up early and shall need all
the sleep we can get. Good night, my darlings,''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>said Mrs. March, as
the hymn ended, for no one cared to try another.

<p/>They kissed her (<font color='blue'><b>Beth</b></font>) quietly, and went to bed as silently as if the dear
invalid lay in the next room. Beth and Amy soon fell asleep in spite
of the great trouble, but Meg lay awake, thinking the most serious
thoughts she (<font color='blue'><b>Meg</b></font>) had ever known in her (<font color='blue'><b>Meg</b></font>) short life. Jo lay motionless, and
her (<font color='blue'><b>Jo</b></font>) sister fancied that she (<font color='blue'><b>Jo</b></font>) was asleep, till a stifled sob made her (<font color='blue'><b>Jo</b></font>)
exclaim, as she (<font color='blue'><b>Jo</b></font>) touched a wet cheek...

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Jo, dear, what is it? Are you crying about father?''

 (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``No, not now.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``What then?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``My... My hair!''  (<font color='red'><b>Jo/Miss Jo/JO</b></font>)</div>burst out poor Jo, trying vainly to smother her (<font color='blue'><b>Jo</b></font>)
emotion in the pillow.

<p/>It did not seem at all comical to Meg, who kissed and caressed the
afflicted heroine in the tenderest manner.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``I'm not sorry,''  (<font color='red'><b>Jo/Miss Jo/JO</b></font>)</div>protested Jo, with a choke. <div class="bookquote">``I'd do it again
tomorrow, if I could. It's only the vain part of me that goes and
cries in this silly way. Don't tell anyone, it's all over now. I
thought you were asleep, so I just made a little private moan for my
one beauty. How came you to be awake?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I can't sleep, I'm so anxious,''  (<font color='red'><b>Meg</b></font>)</div>said Meg.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Think about something pleasant, and you'll soon drop off.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I tried it, but felt wider awake than ever.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``What did you think of?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Handsome faces--eyes particularly,''  (<font color='red'><b>Meg</b></font>)</div>answered Meg, smiling to herself
in the dark.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``What color do you like best?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Brown, that is, sometimes. Blue are lovely.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Jo/Miss Jo/JO</b></font>)</div><p/>Jo laughed, and Meg sharply ordered her (<font color='blue'><b>Meg</b></font>) not to talk, then amiably
promised to make her (<font color='blue'><b>Meg</b></font>) hair curl, and fell asleep to dream of living in
her (<font color='blue'><b>Meg</b></font>) castle in the air.

<p/>The clocks were striking midnight and the rooms were very still as a
figure glided quietly from bed to bed, smoothing a coverlet here,
settling a pillow there, and pausing to look long and tenderly at each
unconscious face, to kiss each with lips that mutely blessed, and to
pray the fervent prayers which only mothers utter. As she (<font color='blue'><b>Meg</b></font>) lifted the
curtain to look out into the dreary night, the moon broke suddenly from
behind the clouds and shone upon her (<font color='blue'><b>Meg</b></font>) like a bright, benignant face,
which seemed to whisper in the silence, <div class="bookquote">``Be comforted, dear soul!
There is always light behind the clouds.''



 (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div><p/>CHAPTER SIXTEEN

<p/>LETTERS

<p/>In the cold gray dawn the sisters lit their lamp and read their chapter
with an earnestness never felt before. For now the shadow of a real
trouble had come, the little books were full of help and comfort, and
as they dressed, they agreed to say goodbye cheerfully and hopefully,
and send their mother on her (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) anxious journey unsaddened by tears or
complaints from them. Everything seemed very strange when they went
down, so dim and still outside, so full of light and bustle within.
Breakfast at that early hour seemed odd, and even Hannah's familiar
face looked unnatural as she (<font color='blue'><b>Hannah</b></font>) flew about her (<font color='blue'><b>Hannah</b></font>) kitchen with her (<font color='blue'><b>Hannah</b></font>) nightcap
on. The big trunk stood ready in the hall, Mother's cloak and bonnet
lay on the sofa, and Mother herself sat trying to eat, but looking so
pale and worn with sleeplessness and anxiety that the girls found it
very hard to keep their resolution. Meg's eyes kept filling in spite
of herself, Jo was obliged to hide her (<font color='blue'><b>Jo</b></font>) face in the kitchen roller more
than once, and the little girls wore a grave, troubled expression, as
if sorrow was a new experience to them.

<p/>Nobody talked much, but as the time drew very near and they sat waiting
for the carriage, Mrs. March said to the girls, who were all busied
about her (<font color='blue'><b>Jo</b></font>), one folding her (<font color='blue'><b>Jo</b></font>) shawl, another smoothing out the strings of
her (<font color='blue'><b>Jo</b></font>) bonnet, a third putting on her (<font color='blue'><b>Jo</b></font>) overshoes, and a fourth fastening up
her (<font color='blue'><b>Jo</b></font>) travelling bag...

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Children, I leave you to Hannah's care and Mr. Laurence's protection.
Hannah is faithfulness itself, and our good neighbor will guard you as
if you were his (<font color='blue'><b>Laurence</b></font>) own. I have no fears for you, yet I am anxious that
you should take this trouble rightly. Don't grieve and fret when I am
gone, or think that you can be idle and comfort yourselves by being
idle and trying to forget. Go on with your work as usual, for work is
a blessed solace. Hope and keep busy, and whatever happens, remember
that you never can be fatherless.''

 (<font color='red'><b>her</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Yes, Mother.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Meg, dear, be prudent, watch over your sisters, consult Hannah, and in
any perplexity, go to Mr. Laurence. Be patient, Jo, don't get
despondent or do rash things, write to me often, and be my brave girl,
ready to help and cheer all. Beth, comfort yourself with your music,
and be faithful to the little home duties, and you, Amy, help all you
can, be obedient, and keep happy safe at home.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``We will, Mother! We will!''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/>The rattle of an approaching carriage made them all start and listen.
That was the hard minute, but the girls stood it well. No one cried,
no one ran away or uttered a lamentation, though their hearts were very
heavy as they sent loving messages to Father, remembering, as they
spoke that it might be too late to deliver them. They kissed their
mother quietly, clung about her (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) tenderly, and tried to wave their hands
cheerfully when she (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) drove away.

<p/>Laurie and his (<font color='blue'><b>Laurie</b></font>) grandfather came over to see her (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) off, and Mr. Brooke
looked so strong and sensible and kind that the girls christened him (<font color='blue'><b>Brooke</b></font>)
``Mr. Greatheart' on the spot.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Good-by, my darlings! God bless and keep us all!''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>whispered Mrs.
March, as she (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) kissed one dear little face after the other, and hurried
into the carriage.

<p/>As she (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) rolled away, the sun came out, and looking back, she (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) saw it
shining on the group at the gate like a good omen. They saw it also,
and smiled and waved their hands, and the last thing she (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) beheld as she (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>)
turned the corner was the four bright faces, and behind them like a
bodyguard, old Mr. Laurence, faithful Hannah, and devoted Laurie.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``How kind everyone is to us!''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Hannah</b></font>) said, turning to find fresh proof of
it in the respectful sympathy of the young man's face.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``I don't see how they can help it,''  (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Brooke/Brooke</b></font>)</div>returned Mr. Brooke, laughing so
infectiously that Mrs. March could not help smiling. And so the journey
began with the good omens of sunshine, smiles, and cheerful words.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``I feel as if there had been an earthquake,''  (<font color='red'><b>Jo/Miss Jo/JO</b></font>)</div>said Jo, as their
neighbors went home to breakfast, leaving them to rest and refresh
themselves.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``It seems as if half the house was gone,''  (<font color='red'><b>Meg</b></font>)</div>added Meg forlornly.

<p/>Beth opened her (<font color='blue'><b>Beth</b></font>) lips to say something, but could only point to the pile
of nicely mended hose which lay on Mother's table, showing that even in
her (<font color='blue'><b>Mother</b></font>) last hurried moments she (<font color='blue'><b>Mother</b></font>) had thought and worked for them. It was a
little thing, but it went straight to their hearts, and in spite of
their brave resolutions, they all broke down and cried bitterly.

<p/>Hannah wisely allowed them to relieve their feelings, and when the
shower showed signs of clearing up, she (<font color='blue'><b>Hannah</b></font>) came to the rescue, armed with
a coffeepot.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Now, my dear young ladies, remember what your ma said, and don't fret.
Come and have a cup of coffee all round, and then let's fall to work
and be a credit to the family.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Hannah</b></font>)</div><p/>Coffee was a treat, and Hannah showed great tact in making it that
morning. No one could resist her (<font color='blue'><b>Hannah</b></font>) persuasive nods, or the fragrant
invitation issuing from the nose of the coffee pot. They drew up to
the table, exchanged their handkerchiefs for napkins, and in ten
minutes were all right again.

<p/><div class="bookquote">''`Hope and keep busy', that's the motto for us, so let's see who will
remember it best. I shall go to Aunt March, as usual. Oh, won't she (<font color='blue'><b>Aunt</b></font>)
lecture though!''  (<font color='red'><b>Jo/Miss Jo/JO</b></font>)</div>said Jo, as she (<font color='blue'><b>Jo</b></font>) sipped with returning spirit.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``I shall go to my Kings, though I'd much rather stay at home and attend
to things here,''  (<font color='red'><b>Meg</b></font>)</div>said Meg, wishing she (<font color='blue'><b>Meg</b></font>) hadn't made her (<font color='blue'><b>Meg</b></font>) eyes so red.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``No need of that. Beth and I can keep house perfectly well,''  (<font color='red'><b>Amy/Amy March</b></font>)</div>put in
Amy, with an important air.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Hannah will tell us what to do, and we'll have everything nice when
you come home,''  (<font color='red'><b>Beth</b></font>)</div>added Beth, getting out her (<font color='blue'><b>Beth</b></font>) mop and dish tub without
delay.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``I think anxiety is very interesting,''  (<font color='red'><b>Amy/Amy March</b></font>)</div>observed Amy, eating sugar
pensively.

<p/>The girls couldn't help laughing, and felt better for it, though Meg
shook her (<font color='blue'><b>Meg</b></font>) head at the young lady who could find consolation in a sugar
bowl.

<p/>The sight of the turnovers made Jo sober again; and when the two went
out to their daily tasks, they looked sorrowfully back at the window
where they were accustomed to see their mother's face. It was gone,
but Beth had remembered the little household ceremony, and there she (<font color='blue'><b>Beth</b></font>)
was, nodding away at them like a rosyfaced mandarin.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``That's so like my Beth!''  (<font color='red'><b>Jo/Miss Jo/JO</b></font>)</div>said Jo, waving her (<font color='blue'><b>Jo</b></font>) hat, with a grateful
face. <div class="bookquote">``Goodbye, Meggy, I hope the Kings won't strain today. Don't
fret about Father, dear,''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Jo</b></font>) added, as they parted.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``And I hope Aunt March won't croak. Your hair is becoming, and it
looks very boyish and nice,''  (<font color='red'><b>Meg</b></font>)</div>returned Meg, trying not to smile at the
curly head, which looked comically small on her (<font color='blue'><b>Meg</b></font>) tall sister's shoulders.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``That's my only comfort.''  (<font color='red'><b>Laurie/Mr. Laurie/LAURIE</b></font>)</div>And, touching her (<font color='blue'><b>Meg</b></font>) hat a la Laurie, away went
Jo, feeling like a shorn sheep on a wintry day.

<p/>News from their father comforted the girls very much, for though
dangerously ill, the presence of the best and tenderest of nurses had
already done him (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) good. Mr. Brooke sent a bulletin every day, and as
the head of the family, Meg insisted on reading the dispatches, which
grew more cheerful as the week passed. At first, everyone was eager to
write, and plump envelopes were carefully poked into the letter box by
one or other of the sisters, who felt rather important with their
Washington correspondence. As one of these packets contained
characteristic notes from the party, we will rob an imaginary mail, and
read them.

<p/>My dearest Mother:

<p/>It is impossible to tell you how happy your last letter made us, for
the news was so good we couldn't help laughing and crying over it. How
very kind Mr. Brooke is, and how fortunate that Mr. Laurence's business
detains him (<font color='blue'><b>Brooke</b></font>) near you so long, since he (<font color='blue'><b>Brooke</b></font>) is so useful to you and Father.
The girls are all as good as gold. Jo helps me with the sewing, and
insists on doing all sorts of hard jobs. I should be afraid she (<font color='blue'><b>Jo</b></font>) might
overdo, if I didn't know her (<font color='blue'><b>Jo</b></font>) `moral fit' wouldn't last long. Beth is
as regular about her (<font color='blue'><b>Beth</b></font>) tasks as a clock, and never forgets what you told
her (<font color='blue'><b>Beth</b></font>). She (<font color='blue'><b>Beth</b></font>) grieves about Father, and looks sober except when she (<font color='blue'><b>Beth</b></font>) is at
her (<font color='blue'><b>Beth</b></font>) little piano. Amy minds me nicely, and I take great care of her (<font color='blue'><b>Beth</b></font>).
She (<font color='blue'><b>Beth</b></font>) does her (<font color='blue'><b>Beth</b></font>) own hair, and I am teaching her (<font color='blue'><b>Beth</b></font>) to make buttonholes and
mend her (<font color='blue'><b>Beth</b></font>) stockings. She (<font color='blue'><b>Beth</b></font>) tries very hard, and I know you will be pleased
with her (<font color='blue'><b>Beth</b></font>) improvement when you come. Mr. Laurence watches over us like
a motherly old hen, as Jo says, and Laurie is very kind and neighborly.
He (<font color='blue'><b>Laurie</b></font>) and Jo keep us merry, for we get pretty blue sometimes, and feel
like orphans, with you so far away. Hannah is a perfect saint. She (<font color='blue'><b>Hannah</b></font>)
does not scold at all, and always calls me Miss Margaret, which is
quite proper, you know, and treats me with respect. We are all well
and busy, but we long, day and night, to have you back. Give my
dearest love to Father, and believe me, ever your own...

<p/>MEG

<p/>This note, prettily written on scented paper, was a great contrast to
the next, which was scribbled on a big sheet of thin foreign paper,
ornamented with blots and all manner of flourishes and curly-tailed
letters.

<p/>My precious Marmee:

<p/>Three cheers for dear Father! Brooke was a trump to telegraph right
off, and let us know the minute he (<font color='blue'><b>Brooke</b></font>) was better. I rushed up garret when
the letter came, and tried to thank god for being so good to us, but I
could only cry, and say, <div class="bookquote">``I'm glad! I'm glad!''  (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div>Didn't that do as well
as a regular prayer? For I felt a great many in my heart. We have
such funny times, and now I can enjoy them, for everyone is so
desperately good, it's like living in a nest of turtledoves. You'd
laugh to see Meg head the table and try to be motherish. She (<font color='blue'><b>Meg</b></font>) gets
prettier every day, and I'm in love with her (<font color='blue'><b>Meg</b></font>) sometimes. The children
are regular archangels, and I--well, I'm Jo, and never shall be
anything else. Oh, I must tell you that I came near having a quarrel
with Laurie. I freed my mind about a silly little thing, and he (<font color='blue'><b>Laurie</b></font>) was
offended. I was right, but didn't speak as I ought, and he (<font color='blue'><b>Laurie</b></font>) marched
home, saying he (<font color='blue'><b>Laurie</b></font>) wouldn't come again till I begged pardon. I declared I
wouldn't and got mad. It lasted all day. I felt bad and wanted you
very much. Laurie and I are both so proud, it's hard to beg pardon.
But I thought he (<font color='blue'><b>Laurie</b></font>)'d come to it, for I was in the right. He (<font color='blue'><b>Laurie</b></font>) didn't come,
and just at night I remembered what you said when Amy fell into the
river. I read my little book, felt better, resolved not to let the sun
set on my anger, and ran over to tell Laurie I was sorry. I met him (<font color='blue'><b>Laurie</b></font>) at
the gate, coming for the same thing. We both laughed, begged each
other's pardon, and felt all good and comfortable again.

<p/>I made a `pome' yesterday, when I was helping Hannah wash, and as
Father likes my silly little things, I put it in to amuse him (<font color='blue'><b>Father</b></font>). Give
him (<font color='blue'><b>Father</b></font>) my lovingest hug that ever was, and kiss yourself a dozen times for
your...

<p/>TOPSY-TURVY JO


<p/>A SONG FROM THE SUDS

<p/>Queen of my tub, I merrily sing,
While the white foam rises high,
And sturdily wash and rinse and wring,
And fasten the clothes to dry.
Then out in the free fresh air they swing,
Under the sunny sky.

<p/>I wish we could wash from our hearts and souls
The stains of the week away,
And let water and air by their magic make
Ourselves as pure as they.
Then on the earth there would be indeed,
A glorious washing day!

<p/>Along the path of a useful life,
Will heart's-ease ever bloom.
The busy mind has no time to think
Of sorrow or care or gloom.
And anxious thoughts may be swept away,
As we bravely wield a broom.

<p/>I am glad a task to me is given,
To labor at day by day,
For it brings me health and strength and hope,
And I cheerfully learn to say,
<div class="bookquote">``Head, you may think, Heart, you may feel,
But, Hand, you shall work alway!''


 (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div><p/>Dear Mother,

<p/>There is only room for me to send my love, and some pressed pansies
from the root I have been keeping safe in the house for Father to see.
I read every morning, try to be good all day, and sing myself to sleep
with Father's tune. I can't sing ``LAND OF THE LEAL' now, it makes me
cry. Everyone is very kind, and we are as happy as we can be without
you. Amy wants the rest of the page, so I must stop. I didn't forget
to cover the holders, and I wind the clock and air the rooms every day.

<p/>Kiss dear Father on the cheek he (<font color='blue'><b>Father</b></font>) calls mine. Oh, do come soon to your
loving...

<p/>LITTLE BETH


<p/>Ma Chere Mamma,

<p/>We are all well I do my lessons always and never corroberate the
girls--Meg says I mean contradick so I put in both words and you can
take the properest. Meg is a great comfort to me and lets me have
jelly every night at tea its so good for me Jo says because it keeps me
sweet tempered. Laurie is not as respeckful as he (<font color='blue'><b>Laurie</b></font>) ought to be now I am
almost in my teens, he (<font color='blue'><b>Laurie</b></font>) calls me Chick and hurts my feelings by talking
French to me very fast when I say Merci or Bon jour as Hattie King
does. The sleeves of my blue dress were all worn out, and Meg put in
new ones, but the full front came wrong and they are more blue than the
dress. I felt bad but did not fret I bear my troubles well but I do
wish Hannah would put more starch in my aprons and have buckwheats
every day. Can't she (<font color='blue'><b>Hannah</b></font>)? Didn't I make that interrigation point nice?
Meg says my punchtuation and spelling are disgraceful and I am
mortyfied but dear me I have so many things to do, I can't stop.
Adieu, I send heaps of love to Papa. Your affectionate daughter...

<p/>AMY CURTIS MARCH


<p/>Dear Mis March,

<p/>I jes drop a line to say we git on fust rate. The girls is clever and
fly round right smart. Miss Meg is going to make a proper good
housekeeper. She (<font color='blue'><b>Meg</b></font>) hes the liking for it, and gits the hang of things
surprisin quick. Jo doos beat all for goin ahead, but she (<font color='blue'><b>Jo</b></font>) don't stop
to cal`k`late fust, and you never know where she (<font color='blue'><b>Jo</b></font>)'s like to bring up.
She (<font color='blue'><b>Jo</b></font>) done out a tub of clothes on Monday, but she (<font color='blue'><b>Jo</b></font>) starched 'em afore
they was wrenched, and blued a pink calico dress till I thought I
should a died a laughin. Beth is the best of little creeters, and a
sight of help to me, bein so forehanded and dependable. She (<font color='blue'><b>Beth</b></font>) tries to
learn everything, and really goes to market beyond her (<font color='blue'><b>Beth</b></font>) years, likewise
keeps accounts, with my help, quite wonderful. We have got on very
economical so fur. I don't let the girls hev coffee only once a week,
accordin to your wish, and keep em on plain wholesome vittles. Amy
does well without frettin, wearin her (<font color='blue'><b>Amy</b></font>) best clothes and eatin sweet
stuff. Mr. Laurie is as full of didoes as usual, and turns the house
upside down frequent, but he (<font color='blue'><b>Laurie</b></font>) heartens the girls, so I let em hev full
swing. The old gentleman sends heaps of things, and is rather wearin,
but means wal, and it aint my place to say nothin. My bread is riz, so
no more at this time. I send my duty to Mr. March, and hope he (<font color='blue'><b>Mr.</b></font>)'s seen
the last of his (<font color='blue'><b>Mr.</b></font>) Pewmonia.

<p/>Yours respectful,

<p/>Hannah Mullet


<p/>Head Nurse of Ward No. 2,


<p/>All serene on the Rappahannock, troops in fine condition, commisary
department well conducted, the Home Guard under Colonel Teddy always on
duty, Commander in Chief General Laurence reviews the army daily,
Quartermaster Mullet keeps order in camp, and Major Lion does picket
duty at night. A salute of twenty-four guns was fired on receipt of
good news from Washington, and a dress parade took place at
headquarters. Commander in chief sends best wishes, in which he (<font color='blue'><b>Commander</b></font>) is
heartily joined by...

<p/>COLONEL TEDDY


<p/>Dear Madam:

<p/>The little girls are all well. Beth and my boy report daily. Hannah is
a model servant, and guards pretty Meg like a dragon. Glad the fine
weather holds. Pray make Brooke useful, and draw on me for funds if
expenses exceed your estimate. Don't let your husband want anything.
Thank God he (<font color='blue'><b>God</b></font>) is mending.

<p/>Your sincere friend and servant, JAMES LAURENCE



<p/>CHAPTER SEVENTEEN

<p/>LITTLE FAITHFUL

<p/>For a week the amount of virtue in the old house would have supplied
the neighborhood. It was really amazing, for everyone seemed in a
heavenly frame of mind, and self-denial was all the fashion. Relieved
of their first anxiety about their father, the girls insensibly relaxed
their praiseworthy efforts a little, and began to fall back into old
ways. They did not forget their motto, but hoping and keeping busy
seemed to grow easier, and after such tremendous exertions, they felt
that Endeavor deserved a holiday, and gave it a good many.

<p/>Jo caught a bad cold through neglect to cover the shorn head enough,
and was ordered to stay at home till she (<font color='blue'><b>Jo</b></font>) was better, for Aunt March
didn't like to hear people read with colds in their heads. Jo liked
this, and after an energetic rummage from garret to cellar, subsided on
the sofa to nurse her (<font color='blue'><b>nurse</b></font>) cold with arsenicum and books. Amy found that
housework and art did not go well together, and returned to her (<font color='blue'><b>Amy</b></font>) mud
pies. Meg went daily to her (<font color='blue'><b>Meg</b></font>) pupils, and sewed, or thought she (<font color='blue'><b>Meg</b></font>) did, at
home, but much time was spent in writing long letters to her (<font color='blue'><b>Meg</b></font>) mother, or
reading the Washington dispatches over and over. Beth kept on, with
only slight relapses into idleness or grieving.

<p/>All the little duties were faithfully done each day, and many of her (<font color='blue'><b>Beth</b></font>)
sisters' also, for they were forgetful, and the house seemed like a
clock whose pendulum was gone a-visiting. When her (<font color='blue'><b>Beth</b></font>) heart got heavy
with longings for Mother or fears for Father, she (<font color='blue'><b>Beth</b></font>) went away into a
certain closet, hid her (<font color='blue'><b>Beth</b></font>) face in the folds of a dear old gown, and made
her (<font color='blue'><b>Beth</b></font>) little moan and prayed her (<font color='blue'><b>Beth</b></font>) little prayer quietly by herself.
Nobody knew what cheered her (<font color='blue'><b>Beth</b></font>) up after a sober fit, but everyone felt
how sweet and helpful Beth was, and fell into a way of going to her (<font color='blue'><b>Beth</b></font>) for
comfort or advice in their small affairs.

<p/>All were unconscious that this experience was a test of character, and
when the first excitement was over, felt that they had done well and
deserved praise. So they did, but their mistake was in ceasing to do
well, and they learned this lesson through much anxiety and regret.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Meg, I wish you'd go and see the Hummels. You know Mother told us not
to forget them.''  (<font color='red'><b>Beth</b></font>)</div>said Beth, ten days after Mrs. March's departure.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``I'm too tired to go this afternoon,''  (<font color='red'><b>Meg</b></font>)</div>replied Meg, rocking comfortably
as she (<font color='blue'><b>Meg</b></font>) sewed.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Can't you, Jo?''  (<font color='red'><b>Beth</b></font>)</div>asked Beth.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Too stormy for me with my cold.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I thought it was almost well.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``It's well enough for me to go out with Laurie, but not well enough to
go to the Hummels',''  (<font color='red'><b>Jo/Miss Jo/JO</b></font>)</div>said Jo, laughing, but looking a little ashamed of
her (<font color='blue'><b>Jo</b></font>) inconsistency.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Why don't you go yourself?''  (<font color='red'><b>Meg</b></font>)</div>asked Meg.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``I have been every day, but the baby is sick, and I don't know what to
do for it. Mrs. Hummel goes away to work, and Lottchen takes care of
it. But it gets sicker and sicker, and I think you or Hannah ought to
go.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Beth</b></font>)</div><p/>Beth spoke earnestly, and Meg promised she (<font color='blue'><b>Meg</b></font>) would go tomorrow.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Ask Hannah for some nice little mess, and take it round, Beth, the air
will do you good,''  (<font color='red'><b>Jo/Miss Jo/JO</b></font>)</div>said Jo, adding apologetically, <div class="bookquote">``I'd go but I want
to finish my writing.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Jo/Miss Jo/JO</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``My head aches and I'm tired, so I thought maybe some of you would go,''
 (<font color='red'><b>Beth</b></font>)</div>said Beth.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Amy will be in presently, and she (<font color='blue'><b>Amy</b></font>) will run down for us,''  (<font color='red'><b>Meg</b></font>)</div>suggested Meg.

<p/>So Beth lay down on the sofa, the others returned to their work, and
the Hummels were forgotten. An hour passed. Amy did not come, Meg
went to her (<font color='blue'><b>Meg</b></font>) room to try on a new dress, Jo was absorbed in her (<font color='blue'><b>Jo</b></font>) story,
and Hannah was sound asleep before the kitchen fire, when Beth quietly
put on her (<font color='blue'><b>Beth</b></font>) hood, filled her (<font color='blue'><b>Beth</b></font>) basket with odds and ends for the poor
children, and went out into the chilly air with a heavy head and a
grieved look in her (<font color='blue'><b>Beth</b></font>) patient eyes. It was late when she (<font color='blue'><b>Beth</b></font>) came back, and
no one saw her (<font color='blue'><b>Beth</b></font>) creep upstairs and shut herself into her (<font color='blue'><b>Beth</b></font>) mother's room.
Half an hour after, Jo went to ``Mother's closet' for something, and
there found little Beth sitting on the medicine chest, looking very
grave, with red eyes and a camphor bottle in her (<font color='blue'><b>Beth</b></font>) hand.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Christopher Columbus! What's the matter?''  (<font color='red'><b>Jo/Miss Jo/JO</b></font>)</div>cried Jo, as Beth put out
her (<font color='blue'><b>Beth</b></font>) hand as if to warn her (<font color='blue'><b>Beth</b></font>) off, and asked quickly...

<p/><div class="bookquote">``You've had the scarlet fever, haven't you?''

 (<font color='red'><b>Beth</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Years ago, when Meg did. Why?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Then I'll tell you. Oh, Jo, the baby's dead!''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``What baby?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Mrs. Hummel's. It died in my lap before she (<font color='blue'><b>Hummel</b></font>) got home,''  (<font color='red'><b>Beth</b></font>)</div>cried Beth
with a sob.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``My poor dear, how dreadful for you! I ought to have gone,''  (<font color='red'><b>Jo/Miss Jo/JO</b></font>)</div>said Jo,
taking her (<font color='blue'><b>Jo</b></font>) sister in her (<font color='blue'><b>Jo</b></font>) arms as she (<font color='blue'><b>Jo</b></font>) sat down in her (<font color='blue'><b>Jo</b></font>) mother's big
chair, with a remorseful face.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``It wasn't dreadful, Jo, only so sad! I saw in a minute it was sicker,
but Lottchen said her (<font color='blue'><b>Jo</b></font>) mother had gone for a doctor, so I took Baby and
let Lotty rest. It seemed asleep, but all of a sudden if gave a little
cry and trembled, and then lay very still. I tried to warm its feet,
and Lotty gave it some milk, but it didn't stir, and I knew it was
dead.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Don't cry, dear! What did you do?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/>``I just sat and held it softly till Mrs. Hummel came with the doctor.
He (<font color='blue'><b>doctor</b></font>) said it was dead, and looked at Heinrich and Minna, who have sore
throats. ``Scarlet fever, ma'am. Ought to have called me before,<div class="bookquote">'' he (<font color='blue'><b>creep</b></font>)
said crossly. Mrs. Hummel told him (<font color='blue'><b>creep</b></font>) she (<font color='blue'><b>Hummel</b></font>) was poor, and had tried to cure
baby herself, but now it was too late, and she (<font color='blue'><b>Hummel</b></font>) could only ask him (<font color='blue'><b>creep</b></font>) to
help the others and trust to charity for his (<font color='blue'><b>creep</b></font>) pay. He (<font color='blue'><b>creep</b></font>) smiled then, and
was kinder, but it was very sad, and I cried with them till he (<font color='blue'><b>creep</b></font>) turned
round all of a sudden, and told me to go home and take belladonna right
away, or I'd have the fever.''

 (<font color='red'><b>me</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``No, you won't!''  (<font color='red'><b>Jo/Miss Jo/JO</b></font>)</div>cried Jo, hugging her (<font color='blue'><b>Jo</b></font>) close, with a frightened look.
<div class="bookquote">``Oh, Beth, if you should be sick I never could forgive myself! What
shall we do?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Don't be frightened, I guess I shan't have it badly. I looked in
Mother's book, and saw that it begins with headache, sore throat, and
queer feelings like mine, so I did take some belladonna, and I feel
better,''  (<font color='red'><b>Beth</b></font>)</div>said Beth, laying her (<font color='blue'><b>Beth</b></font>) cold hands on her (<font color='blue'><b>Beth</b></font>) hot forehead and
trying to look well.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``If Mother was only at home!''  (<font color='red'><b>Jo/Miss Jo/JO</b></font>)</div>exclaimed Jo, seizing the book, and
feeling that Washington was an immense way off. She (<font color='blue'><b>Jo</b></font>) read a page,
looked at Beth, felt her (<font color='blue'><b>Beth</b></font>) head, peeped into her (<font color='blue'><b>Beth</b></font>) throat, and then said
gravely, <div class="bookquote">``You've been over the baby every day for more than a week, and
among the others who are going to have it, so I'm afraid you are going
to have it, Beth. I'll call Hannah, she (<font color='blue'><b>Beth</b></font>) knows all about sickness.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Beth</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Don't let Amy come. She (<font color='blue'><b>Amy</b></font>) never had it, and I should hate to give it to
her (<font color='blue'><b>Amy</b></font>). Can't you and Meg have it over again?''  (<font color='red'><b>Beth</b></font>)</div>asked Beth, anxiously.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``I guess not. Don't care if I do. Serve me right, selfish pig, to let
you go, and stay writing rubbish myself!''  (<font color='red'><b>Jo/Miss Jo/JO</b></font>)</div>muttered Jo, as she (<font color='blue'><b>Jo</b></font>) went to
consult Hannah.

<p/>The good soul was wide awake in a minute, and took the lead at once,
assuring that there was no need to worry; every one had scarlet fever,
and if rightly treated, nobody died, all of which Jo believed, and felt
much relieved as they went up to call Meg.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Now I'll tell you what we'll do,''  (<font color='red'><b>Hannah</b></font>)</div>said Hannah, when she (<font color='blue'><b>Hannah</b></font>) had examined
and questioned Beth, <div class="bookquote">``we will have Dr. Bangs, just to take a look at
you, dear, and see that we start right. Then we'll send Amy off to
Aunt March's for a spell, to keep her (<font color='blue'><b>Aunt</b></font>) out of harm's way, and one of you
girls can stay at home and amuse Beth for a day or two.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Beth</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I shall stay, of course, I'm oldest,''  (<font color='red'><b>Meg</b></font>)</div>began Meg, looking anxious and
self-reproachful.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``I shall, because it's my fault she (<font color='blue'><b>Beth</b></font>) is sick. I told Mother I'd do the
errands, and I haven't,''  (<font color='red'><b>Jo/Miss Jo/JO</b></font>)</div>said Jo decidedly.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Which will you have, Beth? There ain't no need of but one,''  (<font color='red'><b>Hannah</b></font>)</div>aid
Hannah.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Jo, please.''  (<font color='red'><b>Beth</b></font>)</div>And Beth leaned her (<font color='blue'><b>Beth</b></font>) head against her (<font color='blue'><b>Beth</b></font>) sister with a
contented look, which effectually settled that point.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``I'll go and tell Amy,''  (<font color='red'><b>Meg</b></font>)</div>said Meg, feeling a little hurt, yet rather
relieved on the whole, for she (<font color='blue'><b>Meg</b></font>) did not like nursing, and Jo did.

<p/>Amy rebelled outright, and passionately declared that she (<font color='blue'><b>Amy</b></font>) had rather
have the fever than go to Aunt March. Meg reasoned, pleaded, and
commanded, all in vain. Amy protested that she (<font color='blue'><b>Amy</b></font>) would not go, and Meg
left her (<font color='blue'><b>Meg</b></font>) in despair to ask Hannah what should be done. Before she (<font color='blue'><b>Meg</b></font>) came
back, Laurie walked into the parlor to find Amy sobbing, with her (<font color='blue'><b>Amy</b></font>) head
in the sofa cushions. She (<font color='blue'><b>Amy</b></font>) told her (<font color='blue'><b>Amy</b></font>) story, expecting to be consoled,
but Laurie only put his (<font color='blue'><b>Laurie</b></font>) hands in his (<font color='blue'><b>Laurie</b></font>) pockets and walked about the room,
whistling softly, as he (<font color='blue'><b>Laurie</b></font>) knit his (<font color='blue'><b>Laurie</b></font>) brows in deep thought. Presently he (<font color='blue'><b>Laurie</b></font>)
sat down beside her (<font color='blue'><b>Amy</b></font>), and said, in his (<font color='blue'><b>Laurie</b></font>) most wheedlesome tone, <div class="bookquote">``Now be a
sensible little woman, and do as they say. No, don't cry, but hear what
a jolly plan I've got. You go to Aunt March's, and I'll come and take
you out every day, driving or walking, and we'll have capital times.
Won't that be better than moping here?''

 (<font color='red'><b>her</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I don't wish to be sent off as if I was in the way,''  (<font color='red'><b>Amy/Amy March</b></font>)</div>began Amy, in an
injured voice.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Bless your heart, child, it's to keep you well. You don't want to be
sick, do you?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``No, I'm sure I don't, but I dare say I shall be, for I've been with
Beth all the time.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``That's the very reason you ought to go away at once, so that you may
escape it. Change of air and care will keep you well, I dare say, or
if it does not entirely, you will have the fever more lightly. I

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``But it's dull at Aunt March's, and she (<font color='blue'><b>Aunt</b></font>) is so cross,''  (<font color='red'><b>Amy/Amy March</b></font>)</div>said Amy, looking
rather frightened.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``It won't be dull with me popping in every day to tell you how Beth is,
and take you out gallivanting. The old lady likes me, and I'll be as
sweet as possible to her (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>), so she (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) won't peck at us, whatever we do.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Will you take me out in the trotting wagon with Puck?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``On my honor as a gentleman.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``And come every single day?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``See if I don't!''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``And bring me back the minute Beth is well?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``The identical minute.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``And go to the theater, truly?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``A dozen theaters, if we may.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Well--I guess I will,''  (<font color='red'><b>Amy/Amy March</b></font>)</div>said Amy slowly.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Good girl! Call Meg, and tell her (<font color='blue'><b>Meg</b></font>) you'll give in,''  (<font color='red'><b>Laurie/Mr. Laurie/LAURIE</b></font>)</div>said Laurie, with
an approving pat, which annoyed Amy more than the `giving in'.

<p/>Meg and Jo came running down to behold the miracle which had been
wrought, and Amy, feeling very precious and self-sacrificing, promised
to go, if the doctor said Beth was going to be ill.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``How is the little dear?''  (<font color='red'><b>Laurie/Mr. Laurie/LAURIE</b></font>)</div>asked Laurie, for Beth was his (<font color='blue'><b>Laurie</b></font>) especial pet,
and he (<font color='blue'><b>Laurie</b></font>) felt more anxious about her (<font color='blue'><b>Beth</b></font>) than he (<font color='blue'><b>Laurie</b></font>) liked to show.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``She (<font color='blue'><b>Meg</b></font>) is lying down on Mother's bed, and feels better. The baby's death
troubled her (<font color='blue'><b>Meg</b></font>), but I dare say she (<font color='blue'><b>Meg</b></font>) has only got cold. Hannah says she (<font color='blue'><b>Hannah</b></font>)
thinks so, but she (<font color='blue'><b>Hannah</b></font>) looks worried, and that makes me fidgety,''  (<font color='red'><b>Meg</b></font>)</div>answered
Meg.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``What a trying world it is!''  (<font color='red'><b>Jo/Miss Jo/JO</b></font>)</div>said Jo, rumpling up her (<font color='blue'><b>Jo</b></font>) hair in a fretful
way. <div class="bookquote">``No sooner do we get out of one trouble than down comes another.
There doesn't seem to be anything to hold on to when Mother's gone, so
I'm all at sea.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Well, don't make a porcupine of yourself, it isn't becoming. Settle
your wig, Jo, and tell me if I shall telegraph to your mother, or do
anything?''  (<font color='red'><b>Laurie/Mr. Laurie/LAURIE</b></font>)</div>asked Laurie, who never had been reconciled to the loss of
his (<font color='blue'><b>Laurie</b></font>) friend's one beauty.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``That is what troubles me,''  (<font color='red'><b>Meg</b></font>)</div>said Meg. <div class="bookquote">``I think we ought to tell her (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) if
Beth is really ill, but Hannah says we mustn't, for Mother can't leave
Father, and it will only make them anxious. Beth won't be sick long,
and Hannah knows just what to do, and Mother said we were to mind her (<font color='blue'><b>Mother</b></font>),
so I suppose we must, but it doesn't seem quite right to me.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Hum, well, I can't say. Suppose you ask Grandfather after the doctor
has been.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``We will. Jo, go and get Dr. Bangs at once,''  (<font color='red'><b>Meg</b></font>)</div>commanded Meg. <div class="bookquote">``We can't
decide anything till he (<font color='blue'><b>Bangs</b></font>) has been.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Stay where you are, Jo. I'm errand boy to this establishment,''  (<font color='red'><b>Laurie/Mr. Laurie/LAURIE</b></font>)</div>said
Laurie, taking up his (<font color='blue'><b>Laurie</b></font>) cap.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``I'm afraid you are busy,''  (<font color='red'><b>Meg</b></font>)</div>began Meg.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``No, I've done my lessons for the day.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Do you study in vacation time?''  (<font color='red'><b>Jo/Miss Jo/JO</b></font>)</div>asked Jo.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``I follow the good example my neighbors set me,''  (<font color='red'><b>Laurie/Mr. Laurie/LAURIE</b></font>)</div>was Laurie's answer,
as he (<font color='blue'><b>Laurie</b></font>) swung himself out of the room.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``I have great hopes for my boy,''  (<font color='red'><b>Jo/Miss Jo/JO</b></font>)</div>observed Jo, watching him (<font color='blue'><b>Laurie</b></font>) fly over the
fence with an approving smile.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``He (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>) does very well, for a boy,''  (<font color='red'><b>Meg</b></font>)</div>was Meg's somewhat ungracious answer,
for the subject did not interest her (<font color='blue'><b>Meg</b></font>).

<p/>Dr. Bangs came, said Beth had symptoms of the fever, but he (<font color='blue'><b>Bangs</b></font>) thought she (<font color='blue'><b>Beth</b></font>)
would have it lightly, though he (<font color='blue'><b>Bangs</b></font>) looked sober over the Hummel story.
Amy was ordered off at once, and provided with something to ward off
danger, she (<font color='blue'><b>Amy</b></font>) departed in great state, with Jo and Laurie as escort.

<p/>Aunt March received them with her (<font color='blue'><b>Jo</b></font>) usual hospitality.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``What do you want now?''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Jo</b></font>) asked, looking sharply over her (<font color='blue'><b>Jo</b></font>) spectacles,
while the parrot, sitting on the back of her (<font color='blue'><b>Jo</b></font>) chair, called out...

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Go away. No boys allowed here.''

 (<font color='red'><b>the parrot</b></font>)</div><p/>Laurie retired to the window, and Jo told her (<font color='blue'><b>Jo</b></font>) story.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``No more than I expected, if you are allowed to go poking about among
poor folks. Amy can stay and make herself useful if she (<font color='blue'><b>Amy</b></font>) isn't sick,
which I've no doubt she (<font color='blue'><b>Amy</b></font>) will be, looks like it now. Don't cry, child,
it worries me to hear people sniff.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Amy/Amy March</b></font>)</div><p/>Amy was on the point of crying, but Laurie slyly pulled the parrot's
tail, which caused Polly to utter an astonished croak and call out,
<div class="bookquote">``Bless my boots!''  (<font color='red'><b>Polly</b></font>)</div>in such a funny way, that she (<font color='blue'><b>Polly</b></font>) laughed instead.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``What do you hear from your mother?''  (<font color='red'><b>the lady</b></font>)</div>asked the old lady gruffly.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Father is much better,''  (<font color='red'><b>Jo/Miss Jo/JO</b></font>)</div>replied Jo, trying to keep sober.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Oh, is he (<font color='blue'><b>Father</b></font>)? Well, that won't last long, I fancy. March never had any
stamina,''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>was the cheerful reply.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Ha, ha! Never say die, take a pinch of snuff, goodbye, goodbye!''
 (<font color='red'><b>Polly</b></font>)</div>squalled Polly, dancing on her (<font color='blue'><b>Polly</b></font>) perch, and clawing at the old lady's cap
as Laurie tweaked him (<font color='blue'><b>Laurie</b></font>) in the rear.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Hold your tongue, you disrespectful old bird! And, Jo, you'd better
go at once. It isn't proper to be gadding about so late with a
rattlepated boy like...''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Hold your tongue, you disrespectful old bird!''  (<font color='red'><b>Polly</b></font>)</div>cried Polly, tumbling
off the chair with a bounce, and running to peck the `rattlepated' boy,
who was shaking with laughter at the last speech.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``I don't think I can bear it, but I'll try,''  (<font color='red'><b>Amy/Amy March</b></font>)</div>thought Amy, as she (<font color='blue'><b>Amy</b></font>) was
left alone with Aunt March.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Get along, you fright!''  (<font color='red'><b>Polly</b></font>)</div>screamed Polly, and at that rude speech Amy
could not restrain a sniff.



<p/>CHAPTER EIGHTEEN

<p/>DARK DAYS

<p/>Beth did have the fever, and was much sicker than anyone but Hannah and
the doctor suspected. The girls knew nothing about illness, and Mr.
Laurence was not allowed to see her (<font color='blue'><b>Hannah</b></font>), so Hannah had everything her (<font color='blue'><b>Hannah</b></font>) own
way, and busy Dr. Bangs did his (<font color='blue'><b>Bangs</b></font>) best, but left a good deal to the
excellent nurse. Meg stayed at home, lest she (<font color='blue'><b>Meg</b></font>) should infect the Kings,
and kept house, feeling very anxious and a little guilty when she (<font color='blue'><b>Meg</b></font>) wrote
letters in which no mention was made of Beth's illness. She (<font color='blue'><b>Beth</b></font>) could not
think it right to deceive her (<font color='blue'><b>Beth</b></font>) mother, but she (<font color='blue'><b>Beth</b></font>) had been bidden to mind
Hannah, and Hannah wouldn't hear of <div class="bookquote">``Mrs. March bein' told, and worried
just for sech a trifle.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Hannah</b></font>)</div><p/>Jo devoted herself to Beth day and night, not a hard task, for Beth was
very patient, and bore her (<font color='blue'><b>Beth</b></font>) pain uncomplainingly as long as she (<font color='blue'><b>Beth</b></font>) could
control herself. But there came a time when during the fever fits she (<font color='blue'><b>Beth</b></font>)
began to talk in a hoarse, broken voice, to play on the coverlet as if
on her (<font color='blue'><b>Beth</b></font>) beloved little piano, and try to sing with a throat so swollen
that there was no music left, a time when she (<font color='blue'><b>Beth</b></font>) did not know the familiar
faces around her (<font color='blue'><b>Beth</b></font>), but addressed them by wrong names, and called
imploringly for her (<font color='blue'><b>Beth</b></font>) mother. Then Jo grew frightened, Meg begged to be
allowed to write the truth, and even Hannah said she (<font color='blue'><b>Hannah</b></font>) `would think of
it, though there was no danger yet'. A letter from Washington added to
their trouble, for Mr. March had had a relapse, and could not think of
coming home for a long while.

<p/>How dark the days seemed now, how sad and lonely the house, and how
heavy were the hearts of the sisters as they worked and waited, while
the shadow of death hovered over the once happy home. Then it was that
Margaret, sitting alone with tears dropping often on her (<font color='blue'><b>Margaret</b></font>) work, felt how
rich she (<font color='blue'><b>Margaret</b></font>) had been in things more precious than any luxuries money could
buy--in love, protection, peace, and health, the real blessings of
life. Then it was that Jo, living in the darkened room, with that
suffering little sister always before her (<font color='blue'><b>sister</b></font>) eyes and that pathetic voice
sounding in her (<font color='blue'><b>sister</b></font>) ears, learned to see the beauty and the sweetness of
Beth's nature, to feel how deep and tender a place she (<font color='blue'><b>Beth</b></font>) filled in all
hearts, and to acknowledge the worth of Beth's unselfish ambition to
live for others, and make home happy by that exercise of those simple
virtues which all may possess, and which all should love and value more
than talent, wealth, or beauty. And Amy, in her (<font color='blue'><b>Amy</b></font>) exile, longed eagerly
to be at home, that she (<font color='blue'><b>Amy</b></font>) might work for Beth, feeling now that no
service would be hard or irksome, and remembering, with regretful
grief, how many neglected tasks those willing hands had done for her (<font color='blue'><b>Beth</b></font>).
Laurie haunted the house like a restless ghost, and Mr. Laurence locked
the grand piano, because he (<font color='blue'><b>Laurence</b></font>) could not bear to be reminded of the young
neighbor who used to make the twilight pleasant for him (<font color='blue'><b>Laurence</b></font>). Everyone
missed Beth. The milkman, baker, grocer, and butcher inquired how she (<font color='blue'><b>Beth</b></font>)
did, poor Mrs. Hummel came to beg pardon for her (<font color='blue'><b>Hummel</b></font>) thoughtlessness and to
get a shroud for Minna, the neighbors sent all sorts of comforts and
good wishes, and even those who knew her (<font color='blue'><b>Minna</b></font>) best were surprised to find
how many friends shy little Beth had made.

<p/>Meanwhile she (<font color='blue'><b>Beth</b></font>) lay on her (<font color='blue'><b>Beth</b></font>) bed with old Joanna at her (<font color='blue'><b>Beth</b></font>) side, for even in
her (<font color='blue'><b>Beth</b></font>) wanderings she (<font color='blue'><b>Beth</b></font>) did not forget her (<font color='blue'><b>Beth</b></font>) forlorn protege. She (<font color='blue'><b>Beth</b></font>) longed for
her (<font color='blue'><b>Beth</b></font>) cats, but would not have them brought, lest they should get sick,
and in her (<font color='blue'><b>Beth</b></font>) quiet hours she (<font color='blue'><b>Beth</b></font>) was full of anxiety about Jo. She (<font color='blue'><b>Jo</b></font>) sent
loving messages to Amy, bade them tell her (<font color='blue'><b>Amy</b></font>) mother that she (<font color='blue'><b>Amy</b></font>) would write
soon, and often begged for pencil and paper to try to say a word, that
Father might not think she (<font color='blue'><b>Amy</b></font>) had neglected him (<font color='blue'><b>Father</b></font>). But soon even these
intervals of consciousness ended, and she (<font color='blue'><b>Amy</b></font>) lay hour after hour, tossing
to and fro, with incoherent words on her (<font color='blue'><b>Amy</b></font>) lips, or sank into a heavy
sleep which brought her (<font color='blue'><b>Amy</b></font>) no refreshment. Dr. Bangs came twice a day,
Hannah sat up at night, Meg kept a telegram in her (<font color='blue'><b>Meg</b></font>) desk all ready to
send off at any minute, and Jo never stirred from Beth's side.

<p/>The first of December was a wintry day indeed to them, for a bitter
wind blew, snow fell fast, and the year seemed getting ready for its
death. When Dr. Bangs came that morning, he (<font color='blue'><b>Bangs</b></font>) looked long at Beth, held
the hot hand in both his (<font color='blue'><b>Bangs</b></font>) own for a minute, and laid it gently down,
saying, in a low voice to Hannah, <div class="bookquote">``If Mrs. March can leave her (<font color='blue'><b>Jo</b></font>) husband
she (<font color='blue'><b>Jo</b></font>)'d better be sent for.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Hannah</b></font>)</div><p/>Hannah nodded without speaking, for her (<font color='blue'><b>Hannah</b></font>) lips twitched nervously, Meg
dropped down into a chair as the strength seemed to go out of her (<font color='blue'><b>Meg</b></font>) limbs
at the sound of those words, and Jo, standing with a pale face for a
minute, ran to the parlor, snatched up the telegram, and throwing on
her (<font color='blue'><b>Jo</b></font>) things, rushed out into the storm. She (<font color='blue'><b>Jo</b></font>) was soon back, and while
noiselessly taking off her (<font color='blue'><b>Jo</b></font>) cloak, Laurie came in with a letter, saying
that Mr. March was mending again. Jo read it thankfully, but the heavy
weight did not seem lifted off her (<font color='blue'><b>Jo</b></font>) heart, and her (<font color='blue'><b>Jo</b></font>) face was so full of
misery that Laurie asked quickly, <div class="bookquote">``What is it? Is Beth worse?''

 (<font color='red'><b>Laurie/Mr. Laurie/LAURIE</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I've sent for Mother,''  (<font color='red'><b>Jo/Miss Jo/JO</b></font>)</div>said Jo, tugging at her (<font color='blue'><b>Jo</b></font>) rubber boots with a
tragic expression.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Good for you, Jo! Did you do it on your own responsibility?''  (<font color='red'><b>Laurie/Mr. Laurie/LAURIE</b></font>)</div>asked
Laurie, as he (<font color='blue'><b>Laurie</b></font>) seated her (<font color='blue'><b>Jo</b></font>) in the hall chair and took off the rebellious
boots, seeing how her (<font color='blue'><b>Jo</b></font>) hands shook.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``No. The doctor told us to.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Oh, Jo, it's not so bad as that?''  (<font color='red'><b>Laurie/Mr. Laurie/LAURIE</b></font>)</div>cried Laurie, with a startled face.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Yes, it is. She (<font color='blue'><b>Jo</b></font>) doesn't know us, she (<font color='blue'><b>Jo</b></font>) doesn't even talk about the
flocks of green doves, as she (<font color='blue'><b>Jo</b></font>) calls the vine leaves on the wall. She (<font color='blue'><b>Jo</b></font>)
doesn't look like my Beth, and there's nobody to help us bear it.
Mother and father both gone, and God seems so far away I can't find
Him (<font color='blue'><b>God</b></font>).''

 (<font color='red'><b>Jo/Miss Jo/JO</b></font>)</div><p/>As the tears streamed fast down poor Jo's cheeks, she (<font color='blue'><b>Jo</b></font>) stretched out her (<font color='blue'><b>Jo</b></font>)
hand in a helpless sort of way, as if groping in the dark, and Laurie
took it in his (<font color='blue'><b>Laurie</b></font>), whispering as well as he (<font color='blue'><b>Laurie</b></font>) could with a lump in his (<font color='blue'><b>Laurie</b></font>)
throat, <div class="bookquote">``I'm here. Hold on to me, Jo, dear!''

 (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div><p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>Jo</b></font>) could not speak, but she (<font color='blue'><b>Jo</b></font>) did `hold on', and the warm grasp of the
friendly human hand comforted her (<font color='blue'><b>Jo</b></font>) sore heart, and seemed to lead her (<font color='blue'><b>Jo</b></font>)
nearer to the Divine arm which alone could uphold her (<font color='blue'><b>Jo</b></font>) in her (<font color='blue'><b>Jo</b></font>) trouble.

<p/>Laurie longed to say something tender and comfortable, but no fitting
words came to him (<font color='blue'><b>Laurie</b></font>), so he (<font color='blue'><b>Laurie</b></font>) stood silent, gently stroking her (<font color='blue'><b>Jo</b></font>) bent head as
her (<font color='blue'><b>Jo</b></font>) mother used to do. It was the best thing he (<font color='blue'><b>Laurie</b></font>) could have done, far
more soothing than the most eloquent words, for Jo felt the unspoken
sympathy, and in the silence learned the sweet solace which affection
administers to sorrow. Soon she (<font color='blue'><b>Jo</b></font>) dried the tears which had relieved
her (<font color='blue'><b>Jo</b></font>), and looked up with a grateful face.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Thank you, Teddy, I'm better now. I don't feel so forlorn, and will
try to bear it if it comes.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Keep hoping for the best, that will help you, Jo. Soon your mother
will be here, and then everything will be all right.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I'm so glad Father is better. Now she (<font color='blue'><b>Jo</b></font>) won't feel so bad about leaving
him (<font color='blue'><b>Father</b></font>). Oh, me! It does seem as if all the troubles came in a heap, and
I got the heaviest part on my shoulders,''  (<font color='red'><b>Jo/Miss Jo/JO</b></font>)</div>sighed Jo, spreading her (<font color='blue'><b>Jo</b></font>) wet
handkerchief over her (<font color='blue'><b>Jo</b></font>) knees to dry.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Doesn't Meg pull fair?''  (<font color='red'><b>Laurie/Mr. Laurie/LAURIE</b></font>)</div>asked Laurie, looking indignant.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Oh, yes, she (<font color='blue'><b>Meg</b></font>) tries to, but she (<font color='blue'><b>Meg</b></font>) can't love Bethy as I do, and she (<font color='blue'><b>Meg</b></font>) won't
miss her (<font color='blue'><b>Meg</b></font>) as I shall. Beth is my conscience, and I can't give her (<font color='blue'><b>Beth</b></font>) up.
I can't! I can't!''

 (<font color='red'><b>Jo/Miss Jo/JO</b></font>)</div><p/>Down went Jo's face into the wet handkerchief, and she (<font color='blue'><b>Jo</b></font>) cried
despairingly, for she (<font color='blue'><b>Jo</b></font>) had kept up bravely till now and never shed a
tear. Laurie drew his (<font color='blue'><b>Laurie</b></font>) hand across his (<font color='blue'><b>Laurie</b></font>) eyes, but could not speak till
he (<font color='blue'><b>Laurie</b></font>) had subdued the choky feeling in his (<font color='blue'><b>Laurie</b></font>) throat and steadied his (<font color='blue'><b>Laurie</b></font>) lips.
It might be unmanly, but he (<font color='blue'><b>Laurie</b></font>) couldn't help it, and I am glad of it.
Presently, as Jo's sobs quieted, he (<font color='blue'><b>Laurie</b></font>) said hopefully, <div class="bookquote">``I don't think she (<font color='blue'><b>Beth</b></font>)
will die. She (<font color='blue'><b>Beth</b></font>)'s so good, and we all love her (<font color='blue'><b>Beth</b></font>) so much, I don't believe
God will take her (<font color='blue'><b>Beth</b></font>) away yet.''

 (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``The good and dear people always do die,''  (<font color='red'><b>Jo/Miss Jo/JO</b></font>)</div>groaned Jo, but she (<font color='blue'><b>Jo</b></font>) stopped
crying, for her (<font color='blue'><b>Jo</b></font>) friend's words cheered her (<font color='blue'><b>Jo</b></font>) up in spite of her (<font color='blue'><b>Jo</b></font>) own
doubts and fears.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Poor girl, you're worn out. It isn't like you to be forlorn. Stop a
bit. I'll hearten you up in a jiffy.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Laurie/Mr. Laurie/LAURIE</b></font>)</div><p/>Laurie went off two stairs at a time, and Jo laid her (<font color='blue'><b>Jo</b></font>) wearied head down
on Beth's little brown hood, which no one had thought of moving from
the table where she (<font color='blue'><b>Jo</b></font>) left it. It must have possessed some magic, for
the submissive spirit of its gentle owner seemed to enter into Jo, and
when Laurie came running down with a glass of wine, she (<font color='blue'><b>Jo</b></font>) took it with a
smile, and said bravely, <div class="bookquote">``I drink-- Health to my Beth! You are a good
doctor, Teddy, and such a comfortable friend. How can I ever pay you?''
 (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Jo</b></font>) added, as the wine refreshed her (<font color='blue'><b>Jo</b></font>) body, as the kind words had done
her (<font color='blue'><b>Jo</b></font>) troubled mind.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``I'll send my bill, by-and-by, and tonight I'll give you something that
will warm the cockles of your heart better than quarts of wine,''  (<font color='red'><b>Laurie/Mr. Laurie/LAURIE</b></font>)</div>said
Laurie, beaming at her (<font color='blue'><b>Jo</b></font>) with a face of suppressed satisfaction at
something.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``What is it?''  (<font color='red'><b>Jo/Miss Jo/JO</b></font>)</div>cried Jo, forgetting her (<font color='blue'><b>Jo</b></font>) woes for a minute in her (<font color='blue'><b>Jo</b></font>) wonder.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``I telegraphed to your mother yesterday, and Brooke answered she (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>)'d come
at once, and she (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>)'ll be here tonight, and everything will be all right.
Aren't you glad I did it?''

 (<font color='red'><b>Laurie/Mr. Laurie/LAURIE</b></font>)</div><p/>Laurie spoke very fast, and turned red and excited all in a minute, for
he (<font color='blue'><b>Laurie</b></font>) had kept his (<font color='blue'><b>Laurie</b></font>) plot a secret, for fear of disappointing the girls or
harming Beth. Jo grew quite white, flew out of her (<font color='blue'><b>Jo</b></font>) chair, and the
moment he (<font color='blue'><b>Laurie</b></font>) stopped speaking she (<font color='blue'><b>Jo</b></font>) electrified him (<font color='blue'><b>Laurie</b></font>) by throwing her (<font color='blue'><b>Jo</b></font>) arms
round his (<font color='blue'><b>Laurie</b></font>) neck, and crying out, with a joyful cry, <div class="bookquote">``Oh, Laurie! Oh,
Mother! I am so glad!''  (<font color='red'><b>him</b></font>)</div>She (<font color='blue'><b>Jo</b></font>) did not weep again, but laughed
hysterically, and trembled and clung to her (<font color='blue'><b>Jo</b></font>) friend as if she (<font color='blue'><b>Jo</b></font>) was a
little bewildered by the sudden news.

<p/>Laurie, though decidedly amazed, behaved with great presence of mind.
He (<font color='blue'><b>Laurie</b></font>) patted her (<font color='blue'><b>Jo</b></font>) back soothingly, and finding that she (<font color='blue'><b>Jo</b></font>) was recovering,
followed it up by a bashful kiss or two, which brought Jo round at
once. Holding on to the banisters, she (<font color='blue'><b>Jo</b></font>) put him (<font color='blue'><b>Laurie</b></font>) gently away, saying
breathlessly, <div class="bookquote">``Oh, don't! I didn't mean to, it was dreadful of me, but
you were such a dear to go and do it in spite of Hannah that I couldn't
help flying at you. Tell me all about it, and don't give me wine
again, it makes me act so.''

 (<font color='red'><b>him</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I don't mind,''  (<font color='red'><b>Laurie/Mr. Laurie/LAURIE</b></font>)</div>laughed Laurie, as he (<font color='blue'><b>Laurie</b></font>) settled his (<font color='blue'><b>Laurie</b></font>) tie. <div class="bookquote">``Why, you see I
got fidgety, and so did Grandpa. We thought Hannah was overdoing the
authority business, and your mother ought to know. She (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>)'d never forgive
us if Beth... Well, if anything happened, you know. So I got grandpa
to say it was high time we did something, and off I pelted to the
office yesterday, for the doctor looked sober, and Hannah most took my
head off when I proposed a telegram. I never can bear to be `lorded
over', so that settled my mind, and I did it. Your mother will come, I
know, and the late train is in at two A.M. I shall go for her (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>), and
you've only got to bottle up your rapture, and keep Beth quiet till
that blessed lady gets here.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Laurie, you're an angel! How shall I ever thank you?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Fly at me again. I rather liked it,''  (<font color='red'><b>Laurie/Mr. Laurie/LAURIE</b></font>)</div>said Laurie, looking
mischievous, a thing he (<font color='blue'><b>Laurie</b></font>) had not done for a fortnight.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``No, thank you. I'll do it by proxy, when your grandpa comes. Don't
tease, but go home and rest, for you'll be up half the night. Bless
you, Teddy, bless you!''

 (<font color='red'><b>Jo/Miss Jo/JO</b></font>)</div><p/>Jo had backed into a corner, and as she (<font color='blue'><b>Jo</b></font>) finished her (<font color='blue'><b>Jo</b></font>) speech, she (<font color='blue'><b>Jo</b></font>)
vanished precipitately into the kitchen, where she (<font color='blue'><b>Jo</b></font>) sat down upon a
dresser and told the assembled cats that she (<font color='blue'><b>Jo</b></font>) was <div class="bookquote">``happy, oh, so happy!''
 (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>while Laurie departed, feeling that he (<font color='blue'><b>Laurie</b></font>) had made a rather neat thing of
it.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``That's the interferingest chap I ever see, but I forgive him (<font color='blue'><b>chap</b></font>) and do
hope Mrs. March is coming right away,''  (<font color='red'><b>Hannah</b></font>)</div>said Hannah, with an air of
relief, when Jo told the good news.

<p/>Meg had a quiet rapture, and then brooded over the letter, while Jo set
the sickroom in order, and Hannah <div class="bookquote">``knocked up a couple of pies in case
of company unexpected'' (<font color='red'><b>Hannah</b></font>)</div>. A breath of fresh air seemed to blow through
the house, and something better than sunshine brightened the quiet
rooms. Everything appeared to feel the hopeful change. Beth's bird
began to chirp again, and a half-blown rose was discovered on Amy's
bush in the window. The fires seemed to burn with unusual cheeriness,
and every time the girls met, their pale faces broke into smiles as
they hugged one another, whispering encouragingly, <div class="bookquote">``Mother's coming,
dear! Mother's coming!''  (<font color='red'><b>the girls</b></font>)</div>Every one rejoiced but Beth. She (<font color='blue'><b>Beth</b></font>) lay in that
heavy stupor, alike unconscious of hope and joy, doubt and danger. It
was a piteous sight, the once rosy face so changed and vacant, the once
busy hands so weak and wasted, the once smiling lips quite dumb, and
the once pretty, well-kept hair scattered rough and tangled on the
pillow. All day she (<font color='blue'><b>Beth</b></font>) lay so, only rousing now and then to mutter,
<div class="bookquote">``Water!''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>with lips so parched they could hardly shape the word. All
day Jo and Meg hovered over her (<font color='blue'><b>Jo</b></font>), watching, waiting, hoping, and
trusting in God and Mother, and all day the snow fell, the bitter wind
raged, and the hours dragged slowly by. But night came at last, and
every time the clock struck, the sisters, still sitting on either side
of the bed, looked at each other with brightening eyes, for each hour
brought help nearer. The doctor had been in to say that some change,
for better or worse, would probably take place about midnight, at which
time he (<font color='blue'><b>doctor</b></font>) would return.

<p/>Hannah, quite worn out, lay down on the sofa at the bed's foot and fell
fast asleep, Mr. Laurence marched to and fro in the parlor, feeling
that he (<font color='blue'><b>Laurence</b></font>) would rather face a rebel battery than Mrs. March's countenance
as she (<font color='blue'><b>Hannah</b></font>) entered. Laurie lay on the rug, pretending to rest, but staring
into the fire with the thoughtful look which made his (<font color='blue'><b>Laurie</b></font>) black eyes
beautifully soft and clear.

<p/>The girls never forgot that night, for no sleep came to them as they
kept their watch, with that dreadful sense of powerlessness which comes
to us in hours like those.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``If God spares Beth, I never will complain again,''  (<font color='red'><b>Meg</b></font>)</div>whispered Meg
earnestly.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``If god spares Beth, I'll try to love and serve Him (<font color='blue'><b>god</b></font>) all my life,''
 (<font color='red'><b>Jo/Miss Jo/JO</b></font>)</div>answered Jo, with equal fervor.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``I wish I had no heart, it aches so,''  (<font color='red'><b>Meg</b></font>)</div>sighed Meg, after a pause.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``If life is often as hard as this, I don't see how we ever shall get
through it,''  (<font color='red'><b>sister</b></font>)</div>added her (<font color='blue'><b>Meg</b></font>) sister despondently.

<p/>Here the clock struck twelve, and both forgot themselves in watching
Beth, for they fancied a change passed over her (<font color='blue'><b>Beth</b></font>) wan face. The house was
still as death, and nothing but the wailing of the wind broke the deep
hush. Weary Hannah slept on, and no one but the sisters saw the pale
shadow which seemed to fall upon the little bed. An hour went by, and
nothing happened except Laurie's quiet departure for the station.
Another hour, still no one came, and anxious fears of delay in the
storm, or accidents by the way, or, worst of all, a great grief at
Washington, haunted the girls.

<p/>It was past two, when Jo, who stood at the window thinking how dreary
the world looked in its winding sheet of snow, heard a movement by the
bed, and turning quickly, saw Meg kneeling before their mother's easy
chair with her (<font color='blue'><b>Meg</b></font>) face hidden. A dreadful fear passed coldly over Jo, as
she (<font color='blue'><b>Jo</b></font>) thought, <div class="bookquote">``Beth is dead, and Meg is afraid to tell me.''

 (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div><p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>Jo</b></font>) was back at her (<font color='blue'><b>Jo</b></font>) post in an instant, and to her (<font color='blue'><b>Jo</b></font>) excited eyes a great
change seemed to have taken place. The fever flush and the look of
pain were gone, and the beloved little face looked so pale and peaceful
in its utter repose that Jo felt no desire to weep or to lament.
Leaning low over this dearest of her (<font color='blue'><b>Jo</b></font>) sisters, she (<font color='blue'><b>Jo</b></font>) kissed the damp
forehead with her (<font color='blue'><b>Jo</b></font>) heart on her (<font color='blue'><b>Jo</b></font>) lips, and softly whispered, <div class="bookquote">``Good-by, my
Beth. Good-by!''

 (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div><p/>As if awaked by the stir, Hannah started out of her (<font color='blue'><b>Hannah</b></font>) sleep, hurried to
the bed, looked at Beth, felt her (<font color='blue'><b>Beth</b></font>) hands, listened at her (<font color='blue'><b>Beth</b></font>) lips, and
then, throwing her (<font color='blue'><b>Beth</b></font>) apron over her (<font color='blue'><b>Beth</b></font>) head, sat down to rock to and fro,
exclaiming, under her (<font color='blue'><b>Beth</b></font>) breath, <div class="bookquote">``The fever's turned, she (<font color='blue'><b>Beth</b></font>)'s sleepin'
nat`ral, her (<font color='blue'><b>Beth</b></font>) skin's damp, and she (<font color='blue'><b>Beth</b></font>) breathes easy. Praise be given! Oh,
my goodness me!''

 (<font color='red'><b>Beth</b></font>)</div><p/>Before the girls could believe the happy truth, the doctor came to
confirm it. He (<font color='blue'><b>doctor</b></font>) was a homely man, but they thought his (<font color='blue'><b>doctor</b></font>) face quite
heavenly when he (<font color='blue'><b>doctor</b></font>) smiled and said, with a fatherly look at them, <div class="bookquote">``Yes,
my dears, I think the little girl will pull through this time. Keep
the house quiet, let her (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) sleep, and when she (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) wakes, give her (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>)...''

 (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div><p/>What they were to give, neither heard, for both crept into the dark
hall, and, sitting on the stairs, held each other close, rejoicing with
hearts too full for words. When they went back to be kissed and
cuddled by faithful Hannah, they found Beth lying, as she (<font color='blue'><b>Beth</b></font>) used to do,
with her (<font color='blue'><b>Beth</b></font>) cheek pillowed on her (<font color='blue'><b>Beth</b></font>) hand, the dreadful pallor gone, and
breathing quietly, as if just fallen asleep.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``If Mother would only come now!''  (<font color='red'><b>Jo/Miss Jo/JO</b></font>)</div>said Jo, as the winter night began to
wane.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``See,''  (<font color='red'><b>Meg</b></font>)</div>said Meg, coming up with a white, half-opened rose, <div class="bookquote">``I thought
this would hardly be ready to lay in Beth's hand tomorrow if she (<font color='blue'><b>Beth</b></font>)--went
away from us. But it has blossomed in the night, and now I mean to put
it in my vase here, so that when the darling wakes, the first thing she (<font color='blue'><b>Beth</b></font>)
sees will be the little rose, and Mother's face.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Meg</b></font>)</div><p/>Never had the sun risen so beautifully, and never had the world seemed
so lovely as it did to the heavy eyes of Meg and Jo, as they looked out
in the early morning, when their long, sad vigil was done.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``It looks like a fairy world,''  (<font color='red'><b>Meg</b></font>)</div>said Meg, smiling to herself, as she (<font color='blue'><b>Meg</b></font>)
stood behind the curtain, watching the dazzling sight.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Hark!''  (<font color='red'><b>Jo/Miss Jo/JO</b></font>)</div>cried Jo, starting to her (<font color='blue'><b>Jo</b></font>) feet.

<p/>Yes, there was a sound of bells at the door below, a cry from Hannah,
and then Laurie's voice saying in a joyful whisper, <div class="bookquote">``Girls, she (<font color='blue'><b>fairy</b></font>)'s come!
She (<font color='blue'><b>fairy</b></font>)'s come!''



 (<font color='red'><b>Laurie/Mr. Laurie/LAURIE</b></font>)</div><p/>CHAPTER NINETEEN

<p/>AMY``S WILL

<p/>While these things were happening at home, Amy was having hard times at
Aunt March's. She (<font color='blue'><b>Aunt</b></font>) felt her (<font color='blue'><b>Aunt</b></font>) exile deeply, and for the first time in her (<font color='blue'><b>Aunt</b></font>)
life, realized how much she (<font color='blue'><b>Aunt</b></font>) was beloved and petted at home. Aunt March
never petted any one; she (<font color='blue'><b>Aunt</b></font>) did not approve of it, but she (<font color='blue'><b>Aunt</b></font>) meant to be
kind, for the well-behaved little girl pleased her (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) very much, and Aunt
March had a soft place in her (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) old heart for her (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) nephew's children,
though she (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) didn't think it proper to confess it. She (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) really did her (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>)
best to make Amy happy, but, dear me, what mistakes she (<font color='blue'><b>Amy</b></font>) made. Some old
people keep young at heart in spite of wrinkles and gray hairs, can
sympathize with children's little cares and joys, make them feel at
home, and can hide wise lessons under pleasant plays, giving and
receiving friendship in the sweetest way. But Aunt March had not this
gift, and she (<font color='blue'><b>Aunt</b></font>) worried Amy very much with her (<font color='blue'><b>Amy</b></font>) rules and orders, her (<font color='blue'><b>Amy</b></font>) prim
ways, and long, prosy talks. Finding the child more docile and amiable
than her (<font color='blue'><b>Amy</b></font>) sister, the old lady felt it her (<font color='blue'><b>Amy</b></font>) duty to try and counteract,
as far as possible, the bad effects of home freedom and indulgence. So
she (<font color='blue'><b>Amy</b></font>) took Amy by the hand, and taught her (<font color='blue'><b>Amy</b></font>) as she (<font color='blue'><b>Amy</b></font>) herself had been taught
sixty years ago, a process which carried dismay to Amy's soul, and made
her (<font color='blue'><b>Amy</b></font>) feel like a fly in the web of a very strict spider.

<p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>Amy</b></font>) had to wash the cups every morning, and polish up the old-fashioned
spoons, the fat silver teapot, and the glasses till they shone. Then
she (<font color='blue'><b>Amy</b></font>) must dust the room, and what a trying job that was. Not a speck
escaped Aunt March's eye, and all the furniture had claw legs and much
carving, which was never dusted to suit. Then Polly had to be fed, the
lap dog combed, and a dozen trips upstairs and down to get things or
deliver orders, for the old lady was very lame and seldom left her (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) big
chair. After these tiresome labors, she (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) must do her (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) lessons, which was
a daily trial of every virtue she (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) possessed. Then she (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) was allowed one
hour for exercise or play, and didn't she (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) enjoy it?

<p/>Laurie came every day, and wheedled Aunt March till Amy was allowed to
go out with him (<font color='blue'><b>Laurie</b></font>), when they walked and rode and had capital times.
After dinner, she (<font color='blue'><b>Amy</b></font>) had to read aloud, and sit still while the old lady
slept, which she (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) usually did for an hour, as she (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) dropped off over the
first page. Then patchwork or towels appeared, and Amy sewed with
outward meekness and inward rebellion till dusk, when she (<font color='blue'><b>Amy</b></font>) was allowed
to amuse herself as she (<font color='blue'><b>Amy</b></font>) liked till teatime. The evenings were the
worst of all, for Aunt March fell to telling long stories about her (<font color='blue'><b>Aunt</b></font>)
youth, which were so unutterably dull that Amy was always ready to go
to bed, intending to cry over her (<font color='blue'><b>Amy</b></font>) hard fate, but usually going to sleep
before she (<font color='blue'><b>Amy</b></font>) had squeezed out more than a tear or two.

<p/>If it had not been for Laurie, and old Esther, the maid, she (<font color='blue'><b>Esther</b></font>) felt that
she (<font color='blue'><b>Esther</b></font>) never could have got through that dreadful time. The parrot alone
was enough to drive her (<font color='blue'><b>Esther</b></font>) distracted, for he (<font color='blue'><b>Laurie</b></font>) soon felt that she (<font color='blue'><b>Esther</b></font>) did not
admire him (<font color='blue'><b>Laurie</b></font>), and revenged himself by being as mischievous as possible.
He (<font color='blue'><b>Laurie</b></font>) pulled her (<font color='blue'><b>Esther</b></font>) hair whenever she (<font color='blue'><b>Esther</b></font>) came near him (<font color='blue'><b>Laurie</b></font>), upset his (<font color='blue'><b>Laurie</b></font>) bread and milk
to plague her (<font color='blue'><b>Esther</b></font>) when she (<font color='blue'><b>Esther</b></font>) had newly cleaned his (<font color='blue'><b>Laurie</b></font>) cage, made Mop bark by
pecking at him (<font color='blue'><b>Laurie</b></font>) while Madam dozed, called her (<font color='blue'><b>Esther</b></font>) names before company, and
behaved in all respects like an reprehensible old bird. Then she (<font color='blue'><b>Esther</b></font>) could
not endure the dog, a fat, cross beast who snarled and yelped at her (<font color='blue'><b>Esther</b></font>)
when she (<font color='blue'><b>Esther</b></font>) made his (<font color='blue'><b>Laurie</b></font>) toilet, and who lay on his (<font color='blue'><b>Laurie</b></font>) back with all his (<font color='blue'><b>Laurie</b></font>) legs in
the air and a most idiotic expression of countenance when he (<font color='blue'><b>Laurie</b></font>) wanted
something to eat, which was about a dozen times a day. The cook was
bad-tempered, the old coachman was deaf, and Esther the only one who
ever took any notice of the young lady.

<p/>Esther was a Frenchwoman, who had lived with ``Madame', as she (<font color='blue'><b>Esther</b></font>) called her (<font color='blue'><b>Esther</b></font>)
mistress, for many years, and who rather tyrannized over the old lady,
who could not get along without her (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>). Her (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) real name was Estelle, but
Aunt March ordered her (<font color='blue'><b>Estelle</b></font>) to change it, and she (<font color='blue'><b>Estelle</b></font>) obeyed, on condition that
she (<font color='blue'><b>Estelle</b></font>) was never asked to change her (<font color='blue'><b>Estelle</b></font>) religion. She (<font color='blue'><b>Estelle</b></font>) took a fancy to
Mademoiselle, and amused her (<font color='blue'><b>Estelle</b></font>) very much with odd stories of her (<font color='blue'><b>Estelle</b></font>) life in
France, when Amy sat with her (<font color='blue'><b>Amy</b></font>) while she (<font color='blue'><b>Amy</b></font>) got up Madame's laces. She (<font color='blue'><b>Amy</b></font>)
also allowed her (<font color='blue'><b>Amy</b></font>) to roam about the great house, and examine the curious
and pretty things stored away in the big wardrobes and the ancient
chests, for Aunt March hoarded like a magpie. Amy's chief delight was
an Indian cabinet, full of queer drawers, little pigeonholes, and
secret places, in which were kept all sorts of ornaments, some
precious, some merely curious, all more or less antique. To examine and
arrange these things gave Amy great satisfaction, especially the jewel
cases, in which on velvet cushions reposed the ornaments which had
adorned a belle forty years ago. There was the garnet set which Aunt
March wore when she (<font color='blue'><b>Aunt</b></font>) came out, the pearls her (<font color='blue'><b>Aunt</b></font>) father gave her (<font color='blue'><b>Aunt</b></font>) on her (<font color='blue'><b>Aunt</b></font>)
wedding day, her (<font color='blue'><b>Aunt</b></font>) lover's diamonds, the jet mourning rings and pins, the
queer lockets, with portraits of dead friends and weeping willows made
of hair inside, the baby bracelets her (<font color='blue'><b>Aunt</b></font>) one little daughter had worn,
Uncle March's big watch, with the red seal so many childish hands had
played with, and in a box all by itself lay Aunt March's wedding ring,
too small now for her (<font color='blue'><b>Aunt</b></font>) fat finger, but put carefully away like the most
precious jewel of them all.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Which would Mademoiselle choose if she (<font color='blue'><b>Aunt</b></font>) had her (<font color='blue'><b>Aunt</b></font>) will?''  (<font color='red'><b>Esther</b></font>)</div>asked Esther,
who always sat near to watch over and lock up the valuables.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``I like the diamonds best, but there is no necklace among them, and I'm
fond of necklaces, they are so becoming. I should choose this if I
might,''  (<font color='red'><b>Amy/Amy March</b></font>)</div>replied Amy, looking with great admiration at a string of gold
and ebony beads from which hung a heavy cross of the same.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``I, too, covet that, but not as a necklace. Ah, no! To me it is a
rosary, and as such I should use it like a good catholic,''  (<font color='red'><b>Esther</b></font>)</div>said Esther,
eyeing the handsome thing wistfully.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Is it meant to use as you use the string of good-smelling wooden beads
hanging over your glass?''  (<font color='red'><b>Amy/Amy March</b></font>)</div>asked Amy.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Truly, yes, to pray with. It would be pleasing to the saints if one
used so fine a rosary as this, instead of wearing it as a vain bijou.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``You seem to take a great deal of comfort in your prayers, Esther, and
always come down looking quiet and satisfied. I wish I could.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``If Mademoiselle was a Catholic, she (<font color='blue'><b>Esther</b></font>) would find true comfort, but as
that is not to be, it would be well if you went apart each day to
meditate and pray, as did the good mistress whom I served before
Madame. She (<font color='blue'><b>mistress</b></font>) had a little chapel, and in it found solacement for much
trouble.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Would it be right for me to do so too?''  (<font color='red'><b>Amy/Amy March</b></font>)</div>asked Amy, who in her (<font color='blue'><b>Amy</b></font>)
loneliness felt the need of help of some sort, and found that she (<font color='blue'><b>Amy</b></font>) was
apt to forget her (<font color='blue'><b>Amy</b></font>) little book, now that Beth was not there to remind
her (<font color='blue'><b>Beth</b></font>) of it.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``It would be excellent and charming, and I shall gladly arrange the
little dressing room for you if you like it. Say nothing to Madame,
but when she (<font color='blue'><b>mistress</b></font>) sleeps go you and sit alone a while to think good
thoughts, and pray the dear God preserve your sister.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Esther</b></font>)</div><p/>Esther was truly pious, and quite sincere in her (<font color='blue'><b>Esther</b></font>) advice, for she (<font color='blue'><b>Esther</b></font>) had an
affectionate heart, and felt much for the sisters in their anxiety.
Amy liked the idea, and gave her (<font color='blue'><b>Amy</b></font>) leave to arrange the light closet next
her (<font color='blue'><b>Amy</b></font>) room, hoping it would do her (<font color='blue'><b>Amy</b></font>) good.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``I wish I knew where all these pretty things would go when Aunt March
dies,''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Amy</b></font>) said, as she (<font color='blue'><b>Amy</b></font>) slowly replaced the shining rosary and shut the
jewel cases one by one.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``To you and your sisters. I know it, Madame confides in me. I
witnessed her (<font color='blue'><b>Aunt</b></font>) will, and it is to be so,''  (<font color='red'><b>Esther</b></font>)</div>whispered Esther smiling.


<p/><div class="bookquote">``How nice! But I wish she (<font color='blue'><b>Aunt</b></font>)'d let us have them now. Procrastination is
not agreeable,''  (<font color='red'><b>Amy/Amy March</b></font>)</div>observed Amy, taking a last look at the diamonds.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``It is too soon yet for the young ladies to wear these things. The
first one who is affianced will have the pearls, Madame has said it,
and I have a fancy that the little turquoise ring will be given to you
when you go, for Madame approves your good behavior and charming
manners.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Do you think so? Oh, I'll be a lamb, if I can only have that lovely
ring! It's ever so much prettier than Kitty Bryant's. I do like Aunt
March after all.''  (<font color='red'><b>Amy/Amy March</b></font>)</div>And Amy tried on the blue ring with a delighted face
and a firm resolve to earn it.

<p/>From that day she (<font color='blue'><b>Amy</b></font>) was a model of obedience, and the old lady
complacently admired the success of her (<font color='blue'><b>Amy</b></font>) training. Esther fitted up the
closet with a little table, placed a footstool before it, and over it a
picture taken from one of the shut-up rooms. She (<font color='blue'><b>Esther</b></font>) thought it was of no
great value, but, being appropriate, she (<font color='blue'><b>Esther</b></font>) borrowed it, well knowing that
Madame would never know it, nor care if she (<font color='blue'><b>Esther</b></font>) did. It was, however, a
very valuable copy of one of the famous pictures of the world, and
Amy's beauty-loving eyes were never tired of looking up at the sweet
face of the Divine Mother, while her (<font color='blue'><b>Mother</b></font>) tender thoughts of her (<font color='blue'><b>Mother</b></font>) own were
busy at her (<font color='blue'><b>Mother</b></font>) heart. On the table she (<font color='blue'><b>Mother</b></font>) laid her (<font color='blue'><b>Mother</b></font>) little testament and
hymnbook, kept a vase always full of the best flowers Laurie brought
her (<font color='blue'><b>Mother</b></font>), and came every day to `sit alone' thinking good thoughts, and
praying the dear God to preserve her (<font color='blue'><b>Mother</b></font>) sister. Esther had given her (<font color='blue'><b>Esther</b></font>) a
rosary of black beads with a silver cross, but Amy hung it up and did
not use it, feeling doubtful as to its fitness for Protestant prayers.

<p/>The little girl was very sincere in all this, for being left alone
outside the safe home nest, she (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) felt the need of some kind hand to hold
by so sorely that she (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) instinctively turned to the strong and tender
Friend, whose fatherly love most closely surrounds His (<font color='blue'><b>Friend</b></font>) little children.
She (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) missed her (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) mother's help to understand and rule herself, but having
been taught where to look, she (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) did her (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) best to find the way and walk in
it confidingly. But, Amy was a young pilgrim, and just now her (<font color='blue'><b>Amy</b></font>) burden
seemed very heavy. She (<font color='blue'><b>Amy</b></font>) tried to forget herself, to keep cheerful, and
be satisfied with doing right, though no one saw or praised her (<font color='blue'><b>Amy</b></font>) for it.
In her (<font color='blue'><b>Amy</b></font>) first effort at being very, very good, she (<font color='blue'><b>Amy</b></font>) decided to make her (<font color='blue'><b>Amy</b></font>)
will, as Aunt March had done, so that if she (<font color='blue'><b>Amy</b></font>) did fall ill and die, her (<font color='blue'><b>Amy</b></font>)
possessions might be justly and generously divided. It cost her (<font color='blue'><b>Amy</b></font>) a pang
even to think of giving up the little treasures which in her (<font color='blue'><b>Amy</b></font>) eyes were
as precious as the old lady's jewels.

<p/>During one of her (<font color='blue'><b>Amy</b></font>) play hours she (<font color='blue'><b>Amy</b></font>) wrote out the important document as
well as she (<font color='blue'><b>Amy</b></font>) could, with some help from Esther as to certain legal
terms, and when the good-natured Frenchwoman had signed her (<font color='blue'><b>Frenchwoman</b></font>) name, Amy
felt relieved and laid it by to show Laurie, whom she (<font color='blue'><b>Amy</b></font>) wanted as a
second witness. As it was a rainy day, she (<font color='blue'><b>Amy</b></font>) went upstairs to amuse
herself in one of the large chambers, and took Polly with her (<font color='blue'><b>Polly</b></font>) for
company. In this room there was a wardrobe full of old-fashioned
costumes with which Esther allowed her (<font color='blue'><b>Esther</b></font>) to play, and it was her (<font color='blue'><b>Esther</b></font>) favorite
amusement to array herself in the faded brocades, and parade up and
down before the long mirror, making stately curtsies, and sweeping her (<font color='blue'><b>Esther</b></font>)
train about with a rustle which delighted her (<font color='blue'><b>Esther</b></font>) ears. So busy was she (<font color='blue'><b>Esther</b></font>) on
this day that she (<font color='blue'><b>Esther</b></font>) did not hear Laurie's ring nor see his (<font color='blue'><b>Laurie</b></font>) face peeping
in at her (<font color='blue'><b>Esther</b></font>) as she (<font color='blue'><b>Esther</b></font>) gravely promenaded to and fro, flirting her (<font color='blue'><b>Esther</b></font>) fan and
tossing her (<font color='blue'><b>Esther</b></font>) head, on which she (<font color='blue'><b>Esther</b></font>) wore a great pink turban, contrasting
oddly with her (<font color='blue'><b>Esther</b></font>) blue brocade dress and yellow quilted petticoat. She (<font color='blue'><b>Esther</b></font>)
was obliged to walk carefully, for she (<font color='blue'><b>Esther</b></font>) had on high-heeled shoes, and, as
Laurie told Jo afterward, it was a comical sight to see her (<font color='blue'><b>Jo</b></font>) mince along
in her (<font color='blue'><b>Jo</b></font>) gay suit, with Polly sidling and bridling just behind her (<font color='blue'><b>Polly</b></font>),
imitating her (<font color='blue'><b>Polly</b></font>) as well as he (<font color='blue'><b>Laurie</b></font>) could, and occasionally stopping to laugh
or exclaim, <div class="bookquote">``Ain't we fine? Get along, you fright! Hold your tongue!
Kiss me, dear! Ha! Ha!''

 (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div><p/>Having with difficulty restrained an explosion of merriment, lest it
should offend her (<font color='blue'><b>Polly</b></font>) majesty, Laurie tapped and was graciously received.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Sit down and rest while I put these things away, then I want to
consult you about a very serious matter,''  (<font color='red'><b>Amy/Amy March</b></font>)</div>said Amy, when she (<font color='blue'><b>Amy</b></font>) had shown
her (<font color='blue'><b>Amy</b></font>) splendor and driven Polly into a corner. <div class="bookquote">``That bird is the trial
of my life,''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Amy</b></font>) continued, removing the pink mountain from her (<font color='blue'><b>Amy</b></font>) head,
while Laurie seated himself astride a chair.

<p/>``Yesterday, when Aunt was asleep and I was trying to be as still as a
mouse, Polly began to squall and flap about in his (<font color='blue'><b>you</b></font>) cage, so I went to
let him (<font color='blue'><b>you</b></font>) out, and found a big spider there. I poked it out, and it ran
under the bookcase. Polly marched straight after it, stooped down and
peeped under the bookcase, saying, in his (<font color='blue'><b>you</b></font>) funny way, with a cock of his (<font color='blue'><b>you</b></font>)
eye, ``Come out and take a walk, my dear.<div class="bookquote">'' I couldn't help laughing,
which made Poll swear, and Aunt woke up and scolded us both.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Did the spider accept the old fellow's invitation?''  (<font color='red'><b>Laurie/Mr. Laurie/LAURIE</b></font>)</div>asked Laurie,
yawning.

<p/>``Yes, out it came, and away ran Polly, frightened to death, and
scrambled up on Aunt's chair, calling out, ``Catch her (<font color='blue'><b>Aunt</b></font>)! Catch her (<font color='blue'><b>Aunt</b></font>)! Catch
her (<font color='blue'><b>Aunt</b></font>)!<div class="bookquote">'' as I chased the spider.''

 (<font color='red'><b>her</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``That's a lie! Oh, lor!''  (<font color='red'><b>the parrot</b></font>)</div>cried the parrot, pecking at Laurie's toes.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``I'd wring your neck if you were mine, you old torment,''  (<font color='red'><b>Laurie/Mr. Laurie/LAURIE</b></font>)</div>cried Laurie,
shaking his (<font color='blue'><b>Laurie</b></font>) fist at the bird, who put his (<font color='blue'><b>Laurie</b></font>) head on one side and gravely
croaked, <div class="bookquote">``Allyluyer! bless your buttons, dear!''

 (<font color='red'><b>Laurie/Mr. Laurie/LAURIE</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Now I'm ready,''  (<font color='red'><b>Amy/Amy March</b></font>)</div>said Amy, shutting the wardrobe and taking a piece of
paper out of her (<font color='blue'><b>Amy</b></font>) pocket. <div class="bookquote">``I want you to read that, please, and tell me
if it is legal and right. I felt I ought to do it, for life is
uncertain and I don't want any ill feeling over my tomb.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Laurie/Mr. Laurie/LAURIE</b></font>)</div><p/>Laurie bit his (<font color='blue'><b>Laurie</b></font>) lips, and turning a little from the pensive speaker,
read the following document, with praiseworthy gravity, considering the
spelling:

<p/>MY LAST WILL AND TESTIMENT

<p/>I, Amy Curtis March, being in my sane mind, go give and bequeethe all
my earthly property--viz. to wit:--namely

<p/>To my father, my best pictures, sketches, maps, and works of art,
including frames. Also my $100, to do what he (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) likes with.

<p/>To my mother, all my clothes, except the blue apron with pockets--also
my likeness, and my medal, with much love.

<p/>To my dear sister Margaret, I give my turkquoise ring -LRB-if I get it-RRB-,
also my green box with the doves on it, also my piece of real lace for
her (<font color='blue'><b>Margaret</b></font>) neck, and my sketch of her (<font color='blue'><b>Margaret</b></font>) as a memorial of her (<font color='blue'><b>Margaret</b></font>) `little girl'.

<p/>To Jo I leave my breastpin, the one mended with sealing wax, also my
bronze inkstand--she (<font color='blue'><b>Jo</b></font>) lost the cover--and my most precious plaster
rabbit, because I am sorry I burned up her (<font color='blue'><b>Jo</b></font>) story.

<p/>To Beth -LRB-if she (<font color='blue'><b>Jo</b></font>) lives after me-RRB- I give my dolls and the little bureau,
my fan, my linen collars and my new slippers if she (<font color='blue'><b>Jo</b></font>) can wear them being
thin when she (<font color='blue'><b>Jo</b></font>) gets well. And I herewith also leave her (<font color='blue'><b>Jo</b></font>) my regret that
I ever made fun of old Joanna.

<p/>To my friend and neighbor Theodore Laurence I bequeethe my paper mashay
portfolio, my clay model of a horse though he (<font color='blue'><b>Laurence</b></font>) did say it hadn't any
neck. Also in return for his (<font color='blue'><b>Laurence</b></font>) great kindness in the hour of affliction
any one of my artistic works he (<font color='blue'><b>Laurence</b></font>) likes, Noter Dame is the best.

<p/>To our venerable benefactor Mr. Laurence I leave my purple box with a
looking glass in the cover which will be nice for his (<font color='blue'><b>Laurence</b></font>) pens and remind
him (<font color='blue'><b>Laurence</b></font>) of the departed girl who thanks him (<font color='blue'><b>Laurence</b></font>) for his (<font color='blue'><b>Laurence</b></font>) favors to her (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) family,
especially Beth.

<p/>I wish my favorite playmate Kitty Bryant to have the blue silk apron
and my gold-bead ring with a kiss.

<p/>To Hannah I give the bandbox she (<font color='blue'><b>Hannah</b></font>) wanted and all the patchwork I leave
hoping she (<font color='blue'><b>Hannah</b></font>) `will remember me, when it you see'.

<p/>And now having disposed of my most valuable property I hope all will be
satisfied and not blame the dead. I forgive everyone, and trust we may
all meet when the trump shall sound. Amen.

<p/>To this will and testiment I set my hand and seal on this 20th day of
Nov.. Anni Domino 1861.

<p/>Amy Curtis March

<p/>Witnesses:

<p/>Estelle Valnor, Theodore Laurence.


<p/>The last name was written in pencil, and Amy explained that he (<font color='blue'><b>Laurence</b></font>) was to
rewrite it in ink and seal it up for her (<font color='blue'><b>Amy</b></font>) properly.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``What put it into your head? Did anyone tell you about Beth's giving
away her (<font color='blue'><b>Beth</b></font>) things?''  (<font color='red'><b>Laurie/Mr. Laurie/LAURIE</b></font>)</div>asked Laurie soberly, as Amy laid a bit of red tape,
with sealing wax, a taper, and a standish before him (<font color='blue'><b>Laurie</b></font>).

<p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>Amy</b></font>) explained and then asked anxiously, <div class="bookquote">``What about Beth?''

 (<font color='red'><b>She</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I'm sorry I spoke, but as I did, I'll tell you. She (<font color='blue'><b>Beth</b></font>) felt so ill one
day that she (<font color='blue'><b>Beth</b></font>) told Jo she (<font color='blue'><b>Beth</b></font>) wanted to give her (<font color='blue'><b>Beth</b></font>) piano to Meg, her (<font color='blue'><b>Beth</b></font>) cats to
you, and the poor old doll to Jo, who would love it for her (<font color='blue'><b>Jo</b></font>) sake. She (<font color='blue'><b>Jo</b></font>)
was sorry she (<font color='blue'><b>Jo</b></font>) had so little to give, and left locks of hair to the rest
of us, and her (<font color='blue'><b>Jo</b></font>) best love to Grandpa. She (<font color='blue'><b>Jo</b></font>) never thought of a will.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Laurie/Mr. Laurie/LAURIE</b></font>)</div><p/>Laurie was signing and sealing as he (<font color='blue'><b>Laurie</b></font>) spoke, and did not look up till a
great tear dropped on the paper. Amy's face was full of trouble, but
she (<font color='blue'><b>Amy</b></font>) only said, <div class="bookquote">``Don't people put sort of postscripts to their wills,
sometimes?''

 (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Yes, `codicils', they call them.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Put one in mine then, that I wish all my curls cut off, and given
round to my friends. I forgot it, but I want it done though it will
spoil my looks.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Laurie/Mr. Laurie/LAURIE</b></font>)</div><p/>Laurie added it, smiling at Amy's last and greatest sacrifice. Then he (<font color='blue'><b>Laurie</b></font>)
amused her (<font color='blue'><b>Amy</b></font>) for an hour, and was much interested in all her (<font color='blue'><b>Amy</b></font>) trials. But
when he (<font color='blue'><b>Laurie</b></font>) came to go, Amy held him (<font color='blue'><b>Laurie</b></font>) back to whisper with trembling lips,
<div class="bookquote">``Is there really any danger about Beth?''

 (<font color='red'><b>him</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I'm afraid there is, but we must hope for the best, so don't cry,
dear.''  (<font color='red'><b>Laurie/Mr. Laurie/LAURIE</b></font>)</div>And Laurie put his (<font color='blue'><b>Laurie</b></font>) arm about her (<font color='blue'><b>Amy</b></font>) with a brotherly gesture which
was very comforting.

<p/>When he (<font color='blue'><b>Laurie</b></font>) had gone, she (<font color='blue'><b>Amy</b></font>) went to her (<font color='blue'><b>Amy</b></font>) little chapel, and sitting in the
twilight, prayed for Beth, with streaming tears and an aching heart,
feeling that a million turquoise rings would not console her (<font color='blue'><b>Beth</b></font>) for the
loss of her (<font color='blue'><b>Beth</b></font>) gentle little sister.



<p/>CHAPTER TWENTY

<p/>CONFIDENTIAL

<p/>I don't think I have any words in which to tell the meeting of the
mother and daughters. Such hours are beautiful to live, but very hard
to describe, so I will leave it to the imagination of my readers,
merely saying that the house was full of genuine happiness, and that
Meg's tender hope was realized, for when Beth woke from that long,
healing sleep, the first objects on which her (<font color='blue'><b>Beth</b></font>) eyes fell were the little
rose and Mother's face. Too weak to wonder at anything, she (<font color='blue'><b>Beth</b></font>) only
smiled and nestled close in the loving arms about her (<font color='blue'><b>Beth</b></font>), feeling that the
hungry longing was satisfied at last. Then she (<font color='blue'><b>Beth</b></font>) slept again, and the
girls waited upon their mother, for she (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) would not unclasp the thin hand
which clung to hers even in sleep.

<p/>Hannah had `dished up' an astonishing breakfast for the traveler,
finding it impossible to vent her (<font color='blue'><b>Hannah</b></font>) excitement in any other way, and Meg
and Jo fed their mother like dutiful young storks, while they listened
to her (<font color='blue'><b>Meg</b></font>) whispered account of Father's state, Mr. Brooke's promise to
stay and nurse him (<font color='blue'><b>Brooke</b></font>), the delays which the storm occasioned on the
homeward journey, and the unspeakable comfort Laurie's hopeful face had
given her (<font color='blue'><b>nurse</b></font>) when she (<font color='blue'><b>nurse</b></font>) arrived, worn out with fatigue, anxiety, and cold.

<p/>What a strange yet pleasant day that was. So brilliant and gay
without, for all the world seemed abroad to welcome the first snow. So
quiet and reposeful within, for everyone slept, spent with watching,
and a Sabbath stillness reigned through the house, while nodding Hannah
mounted guard at the door. With a blissful sense of burdens lifted
off, Meg and Jo closed their weary eyes, and lay at rest, like
storm-beaten boats safe at anchor in a quiet harbor. Mrs. March would
not leave Beth's side, but rested in the big chair, waking often to
look at, touch, and brood over her (<font color='blue'><b>Beth</b></font>) child, like a miser over some
recovered treasure.

<p/>Laurie meanwhile posted off to comfort Amy, and told his (<font color='blue'><b>Laurie</b></font>) story so well
that Aunt March actually `sniffed' herself, and never once said <div class="bookquote">``I told
you so'' (<font color='red'><b>Aunt</b></font>)</div>. Amy came out so strong on this occasion that I think the good
thoughts in the little chapel really began to bear fruit. She (<font color='blue'><b>Amy</b></font>) dried
her (<font color='blue'><b>Amy</b></font>) tears quickly, restrained her (<font color='blue'><b>Amy</b></font>) impatience to see her (<font color='blue'><b>Amy</b></font>) mother, and
never even thought of the turquoise ring, when the old lady heartily
agreed in Laurie's opinion, that she (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) behaved `like a capital little
woman'. Even Polly seemed impressed, for he (<font color='blue'><b>Laurie</b></font>) called her (<font color='blue'><b>Polly</b></font>) a good girl,
blessed her (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) buttons, and begged her (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) to <div class="bookquote">``come and take a walk, dear'' (<font color='red'><b>her</b></font>)</div>, in
his (<font color='blue'><b>Laurie</b></font>) most affable tone. She (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) would very gladly have gone out to enjoy
the bright wintry weather, but discovering that Laurie was dropping
with sleep in spite of manful efforts to conceal the fact, she (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>)
persuaded him (<font color='blue'><b>Laurie</b></font>) to rest on the sofa, while she (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) wrote a note to her (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>)
mother. She (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) was a long time about it, and when she (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) returned, he (<font color='blue'><b>Laurie</b></font>) was
stretched out with both arms under his (<font color='blue'><b>Laurie</b></font>) head, sound asleep, while Aunt
March had pulled down the curtains and sat doing nothing in an unusual
fit of benignity.

<p/>After a while, they began to think he (<font color='blue'><b>Laurie</b></font>) was not going to wake up till
night, and I'm not sure that he (<font color='blue'><b>Laurie</b></font>) would, had he (<font color='blue'><b>Laurie</b></font>) not been effectually
roused by Amy's cry of joy at sight of her (<font color='blue'><b>Amy</b></font>) mother. There probably were
a good many happy little girls in and about the city that day, but it
is my private opinion that Amy was the happiest of all, when she (<font color='blue'><b>Amy</b></font>) sat in
her (<font color='blue'><b>Amy</b></font>) mother's lap and told her (<font color='blue'><b>Amy</b></font>) trials, receiving consolation and
compensation in the shape of approving smiles and fond caresses. They
were alone together in the chapel, to which her (<font color='blue'><b>Amy</b></font>) mother did not object
when its purpose was explained to her (<font color='blue'><b>Amy</b></font>).

<p/><div class="bookquote">``On the contrary, I like it very much, dear,''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>looking from the dusty
rosary to the well-worn little book, and the lovely picture with its
garland of evergreen. <div class="bookquote">``It is an excellent plan to have some place
where we can go to be quiet, when things vex or grieve us. There are a
good many hard times in this life of ours, but we can always bear them
if we ask help in the right way. I think my little girl is learning
this.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Yes, Mother, and when I go home I mean to have a corner in the big
closet to put my books and the copy of that picture which I've tried to
make. The woman's face is not good, it's too beautiful for me to draw,
but the baby is done better, and I love it very much. I like to think
He (<font color='blue'><b>we</b></font>) was a little child once, for then I don't seem so far away, and that
helps me.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Amy/Amy March</b></font>)</div><p/>As Amy pointed to the smiling Christ child on his (<font color='blue'><b>Christ</b></font>) Mother's knee, Mrs.
March saw something on the lifted hand that made her (<font color='blue'><b>Amy</b></font>) smile. She (<font color='blue'><b>Amy</b></font>) said
nothing, but Amy understood the look, and after a minute's pause, she (<font color='blue'><b>Amy</b></font>)
added gravely, <div class="bookquote">``I wanted to speak to you about this, but I forgot it.
Aunt gave me the ring today. She (<font color='blue'><b>Aunt</b></font>) called me to her (<font color='blue'><b>Aunt</b></font>) and kissed me, and
put it on my finger, and said I was a credit to her (<font color='blue'><b>Aunt</b></font>), and she (<font color='blue'><b>Aunt</b></font>)'d like to
keep me always. She (<font color='blue'><b>Aunt</b></font>) gave that funny guard to keep the turquoise on, as
it's too big. I'd like to wear them Mother, can I?''

 (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``They are very pretty, but I think you're rather too young for such
ornaments, Amy,''  (<font color='red'><b>the guard</b></font>)</div>said Mrs. March, looking at the plump little hand,
with the band of sky-blue stones on the forefinger, and the quaint
guard formed of two tiny golden hands clasped together.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``I'll try not to be vain,''  (<font color='red'><b>Amy/Amy March</b></font>)</div>said Amy. <div class="bookquote">``I don't think I like it only
because it's so pretty, but I want to wear it as the girl in the story
wore her (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) bracelet, to remind me of something.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Do you mean Aunt March?''  (<font color='red'><b>mother</b></font>)</div>asked her (<font color='blue'><b>Amy</b></font>) mother, laughing.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``No, to remind me not to be selfish.''  (<font color='red'><b>Amy/Amy March</b></font>)</div>Amy looked so earnest and
sincere about it that her (<font color='blue'><b>Amy</b></font>) mother stopped laughing, and listened
respectfully to the little plan.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``I've thought a great deal lately about my `bundle of naughties', and
being selfish is the largest one in it, so I'm going to try hard to
cure it, if I can. Beth isn't selfish, and that's the reason everyone
loves her (<font color='blue'><b>Beth</b></font>) and feels so bad at the thoughts of losing her (<font color='blue'><b>Beth</b></font>). People
wouldn't feel so bad about me if I was sick, and I don't deserve to
have them, but I'd like to be loved and missed by a great many friends,
so I'm going to try and be like Beth all I can. I'm apt to forget my
resolutions, but if I had something always about me to remind me, I
guess I should do better. May we try this way?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Yes, but I have more faith in the corner of the big closet. Wear your
ring, dear, and do your best. I think you will prosper, for the
sincere wish to be good is half the battle. Now I must go back to
Beth. Keep up your heart, little daughter, and we will soon have you
home again.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Meg</b></font>)</div><p/>That evening while Meg was writing to her (<font color='blue'><b>Meg</b></font>) father to report the
traveler's safe arrival, Jo slipped upstairs into Beth's room, and
finding her (<font color='blue'><b>Beth</b></font>) mother in her (<font color='blue'><b>Beth</b></font>) usual place, stood a minute twisting her (<font color='blue'><b>Beth</b></font>)
fingers in her (<font color='blue'><b>Beth</b></font>) hair, with a worried gesture and an undecided look.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``What is it, deary?''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>asked Mrs. March, holding out her (<font color='blue'><b>Beth</b></font>) hand, with a
face which invited confidence.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``I want to tell you something, Mother.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``About Meg?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``How quickly you guessed! Yes, it's about her (<font color='blue'><b>Meg</b></font>), and though it's a
little thing, it fidgets me.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Beth is asleep. Speak low, and tell me all about it. That Moffat
hasn't been here, I hope?''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>asked Mrs. March rather sharply.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``No. I should have shut the door in his (<font color='blue'><b>Moffat</b></font>) face if he (<font color='blue'><b>Moffat</b></font>) had,''  (<font color='red'><b>Jo/Miss Jo/JO</b></font>)</div>said Jo,
settling herself on the floor at her (<font color='blue'><b>Jo</b></font>) mother's feet. <div class="bookquote">``Last summer Meg
left a pair of gloves over at the Laurences' and only one was returned.
We forgot about it, till Teddy told me that Mr. Brooke owned that he (<font color='blue'><b>Brooke</b></font>)
liked Meg but didn't dare say so, she (<font color='blue'><b>Meg</b></font>) was so young and he (<font color='blue'><b>Brooke</b></font>) so poor.
Now, isn't it a dreadful state of things?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Do you think Meg cares for him (<font color='blue'><b>Brooke</b></font>)?''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>asked Mrs. March, with an anxious
look.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Mercy me! I don't know anything about love and such nonsense!''  (<font color='red'><b>Jo/Miss Jo/JO</b></font>)</div>cried
Jo, with a funny mixture of interest and contempt. <div class="bookquote">``In novels, the
girls show it by starting and blushing, fainting away, growing thin,
and acting like fools. Now Meg does not do anything of the sort. She (<font color='blue'><b>Meg</b></font>)
eats and drinks and sleeps like a sensible creature, she (<font color='blue'><b>Meg</b></font>) looks straight
in my face when I talk about that man, and only blushes a little bit
when Teddy jokes about lovers. I forbid him (<font color='blue'><b>Teddy</b></font>) to do it, but he (<font color='blue'><b>Teddy</b></font>) doesn't
mind me as he (<font color='blue'><b>Teddy</b></font>) ought.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Then you fancy that Meg is not interested in John?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Who?''  (<font color='red'><b>Jo/Miss Jo/JO</b></font>)</div>cried Jo, staring.

<p/>``Mr. Brooke. I call him (<font color='blue'><b>Brooke</b></font>) <div class="bookquote">``John' now. We fell into the way of doing so
at the hospital, and he (<font color='blue'><b>Brooke</b></font>) likes it.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Oh, dear! I know you'll take his (<font color='blue'><b>Brooke</b></font>) part. He (<font color='blue'><b>Brooke</b></font>)'s been good to Father, and
you won't send him (<font color='blue'><b>Brooke</b></font>) away, but let Meg marry him (<font color='blue'><b>Brooke</b></font>), if she (<font color='blue'><b>Meg</b></font>) wants to. Mean
thing! To go petting Papa and helping you, just to wheedle you into
liking him (<font color='blue'><b>Papa</b></font>).''  (<font color='red'><b>Jo/Miss Jo/JO</b></font>)</div>And Jo pulled her (<font color='blue'><b>Jo</b></font>) hair again with a wrathful tweak.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``My dear, don't get angry about it, and I will tell you how it
happened. John went with me at Mr. Laurence's request, and was so
devoted to poor Father that we couldn't help getting fond of him (<font color='blue'><b>Father</b></font>). He (<font color='blue'><b>Father</b></font>)
was perfectly open and honorable about Meg, for he (<font color='blue'><b>Father</b></font>) told us he (<font color='blue'><b>Father</b></font>) loved
her (<font color='blue'><b>Meg</b></font>), but would earn a comfortable home before he (<font color='blue'><b>Father</b></font>) asked her (<font color='blue'><b>Meg</b></font>) to marry
him (<font color='blue'><b>Father</b></font>). He (<font color='blue'><b>Father</b></font>) only wanted our leave to love her (<font color='blue'><b>Meg</b></font>) and work for her (<font color='blue'><b>Meg</b></font>), and the
right to make her (<font color='blue'><b>Meg</b></font>) love him (<font color='blue'><b>Father</b></font>) if he (<font color='blue'><b>Father</b></font>) could. He (<font color='blue'><b>Father</b></font>) is a truly excellent young
man, and we could not refuse to listen to him (<font color='blue'><b>Father</b></font>), but I will not consent
to Meg's engaging herself so young.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Of course not. It would be idiotic! I knew there was mischief
brewing. I felt it, and now it's worse than I imagined. I just wish I
could marry Meg myself, and keep her (<font color='blue'><b>Meg</b></font>) safe in the family.''

 (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div><p/>This odd arrangement made Mrs. March smile, but she (<font color='blue'><b>Jo</b></font>) said gravely, <div class="bookquote">``Jo,
I confide in you and don't wish you to say anything to Meg yet. When
John comes back, and I see them together, I can judge better of her (<font color='blue'><b>John</b></font>)
feelings toward him (<font color='blue'><b>Father</b></font>).''

 (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``She (<font color='blue'><b>John</b></font>)'ll see those handsome eyes that she (<font color='blue'><b>John</b></font>) talks about, and then it will
be all up with her (<font color='blue'><b>John</b></font>). She (<font color='blue'><b>John</b></font>)'s got such a soft heart, it will melt like
butter in the sun if anyone looks sentimentlly at her (<font color='blue'><b>John</b></font>). She (<font color='blue'><b>John</b></font>) read the
short reports he (<font color='blue'><b>Father</b></font>) sent more than she (<font color='blue'><b>John</b></font>) did your letters, and pinched me
when I spoke of it, and likes brown eyes, and doesn't think John an
ugly name, and she (<font color='blue'><b>John</b></font>)'ll go and fall in love, and there's an end of peace
and fun, and cozy times together. I see it all! They'll go lovering
around the house, and we shall have to dodge. Meg will be absorbed and
no good to me any more. Brooke will scratch up a fortune somehow, carry
her (<font color='blue'><b>Meg</b></font>) off, and make a hole in the family, and I shall break my heart, and
everything will be abominably uncomfortable. Oh, dear me! Why weren't
we all boys, then there wouldn't be any bother.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Jo/Miss Jo/JO</b></font>)</div><p/>Jo leaned her (<font color='blue'><b>Jo</b></font>) chin on her (<font color='blue'><b>Jo</b></font>) knees in a disconsolate attitude and shook
her (<font color='blue'><b>Jo</b></font>) fist at the reprehensible John. Mrs. March sighed, and Jo looked
up with an air of relief.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``You don't like it, Mother? I'm glad of it. Let's send him (<font color='blue'><b>Brooke</b></font>) about his (<font color='blue'><b>Brooke</b></font>)
business, and not tell Meg a word of it, but all be happy together as
we always have been.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I did wrong to sigh, Jo. It is natural and right you should all go to
homes of your own in time, but I do want to keep my girls as long as I
can, and I am sorry that this happened so soon, for Meg is only
seventeen and it will be some years before John can make a home for
her (<font color='blue'><b>John</b></font>). Your father and I have agreed that she (<font color='blue'><b>John</b></font>) shall not bind herself in
any way, nor be married, before twenty. If she (<font color='blue'><b>John</b></font>) and John love one
another, they can wait, and test the love by doing so. She (<font color='blue'><b>John</b></font>) is
conscientious, and I have no fear of her (<font color='blue'><b>John</b></font>) treating him (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) unkindly. My
pretty, tender hearted girl! I hope things will go happily with her (<font color='blue'><b>John</b></font>).''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Hadn't you rather have her (<font color='blue'><b>John</b></font>) marry a rich man?''  (<font color='red'><b>Jo/Miss Jo/JO</b></font>)</div>asked Jo, as her (<font color='blue'><b>Jo</b></font>)
mother's voice faltered a little over the last words.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Money is a good and useful thing, Jo, and I hope my girls will never
feel the need of it too bitterly, nor be tempted by too much. I should
like to know that John was firmly established in some good business,
which gave him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) an income large enough to keep free from debt and make
Meg comfortable. I'm not ambitious for a splendid fortune, a
fashionable position, or a great name for my girls. If rank and money
come with love and virtue, also, I should accept them gratefully, and
enjoy your good fortune, but I know, by experience, how much genuine
happiness can be had in a plain little house, where the daily bread is
earned, and some privations give sweetness to the few pleasures. I am
content to see Meg begin humbly, for if I am not mistaken, she (<font color='blue'><b>Meg</b></font>) will be
rich in the possession of a good man's heart, and that is better than a
fortune.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I understand, Mother, and quite agree, but I'm disappointed about Meg,
for I'd planned to have her (<font color='blue'><b>Meg</b></font>) marry Teddy by-and-by and sit in the lap of
luxury all her (<font color='blue'><b>Meg</b></font>) days. Wouldn't it be nice?''  (<font color='red'><b>Jo/Miss Jo/JO</b></font>)</div>asked Jo, looking up with a
brighter face.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``He (<font color='blue'><b>Teddy</b></font>) is younger than she (<font color='blue'><b>Meg</b></font>), you know,''  (<font color='red'><b>Jo/Miss Jo/JO</b></font>)</div>began Mrs. March, but Jo broke in...

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Only a little, he (<font color='blue'><b>Teddy</b></font>)'s old for his (<font color='blue'><b>Teddy</b></font>) age, and tall, and can be quite
grown-up in his (<font color='blue'><b>Teddy</b></font>) manners if he (<font color='blue'><b>Teddy</b></font>) likes. Then he (<font color='blue'><b>Teddy</b></font>)'s rich and generous and
good, and loves us all, and I say it's a pity my plan is spoiled.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Jo/Miss Jo/JO</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I'm afraid Laurie is hardly grown-up enough for Meg, and altogether
too much of a weathercock just now for anyone to depend on. Don't make
plans, Jo, but let time and their own hearts mate your friends. We
can't meddle safely in such matters, and had better not get `romantic
rubbish' as you call it, into our heads, lest it spoil our friendship.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Well, I won't, but I hate to see things going all crisscross and
getting snarled up, when a pull here and a snip there would straighten
it out. I wish wearing flatirons on our heads would keep us from
growing up. But buds will be roses, and kittens cats, more's the pity!''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``What's that about flatirons and cats?''  (<font color='red'><b>Meg</b></font>)</div>asked Meg, as she (<font color='blue'><b>Jo</b></font>) crept into
the room with the finished letter in her (<font color='blue'><b>Jo</b></font>) hand.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Only one of my stupid speeches. I'm going to bed. Come, Peggy,''  (<font color='red'><b>Jo/Miss Jo/JO</b></font>)</div>said
Jo, unfolding herself like an animated puzzle.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Quite right, and beautifully written. Please add that I send my love
to John,''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>said Mrs. March, as she (<font color='blue'><b>Jo</b></font>) glanced over the letter and gave it
back.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Do you call him (<font color='blue'><b>my</b></font>) `John'?''  (<font color='red'><b>Meg</b></font>)</div>asked Meg, smiling, with her (<font color='blue'><b>Meg</b></font>) innocent eyes
looking down into her (<font color='blue'><b>Meg</b></font>) mother's.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Yes, he (<font color='blue'><b>my</b></font>) has been like a son to us, and we are very fond of him (<font color='blue'><b>my</b></font>),''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>replied Mrs. March, returning the look with a keen one.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``I'm glad of that, he (<font color='blue'><b>my</b></font>) is so lonely. Good night, Mother, dear. It is
so inexpressibly comfortable to have you here,''  (<font color='red'><b>Meg</b></font>)</div>was Meg's answer.

<p/>The kiss her (<font color='blue'><b>Meg</b></font>) mother gave her (<font color='blue'><b>Meg</b></font>) was a very tender one, and as she (<font color='blue'><b>Meg</b></font>) went
away, Mrs. March said, with a mixture of satisfaction and regret, <div class="bookquote">``She (<font color='blue'><b>Mother</b></font>)
does not love John yet, but will soon learn to.''



 (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div><p/>CHAPTER TWENTY-ONE

<p/>LAURIE MAKES MISCHIEF, AND JO MAKES PEACE

<p/>Jo's face was a study next day, for the secret rather weighed upon her (<font color='blue'><b>Jo</b></font>),
and she (<font color='blue'><b>Jo</b></font>) found it hard not to look mysterious and important. Meg
observed it, but did not trouble herself to make inquiries, for she (<font color='blue'><b>Meg</b></font>) had
learned that the best way to manage Jo was by the law of contraries, so
she (<font color='blue'><b>Jo</b></font>) felt sure of being told everything if she (<font color='blue'><b>Jo</b></font>) did not ask. She (<font color='blue'><b>Jo</b></font>) was
rather surprised, therefore, when the silence remained unbroken, and Jo
assumed a patronizing air, which decidedly aggravated Meg, who in turn
assumed an air of dignified reserve and devoted herself to her (<font color='blue'><b>Meg</b></font>) mother.
This left Jo to her (<font color='blue'><b>Jo</b></font>) own devices, for Mrs. March had taken her (<font color='blue'><b>Jo</b></font>) place as
nurse, and bade her (<font color='blue'><b>Jo</b></font>) rest, exercise, and amuse herself after her (<font color='blue'><b>Jo</b></font>) long
confinement. Amy being gone, Laurie was her (<font color='blue'><b>Amy</b></font>) only refuge, and much as
she (<font color='blue'><b>Amy</b></font>) enjoyed his (<font color='blue'><b>Laurie</b></font>) society, she (<font color='blue'><b>Amy</b></font>) rather dreaded him (<font color='blue'><b>Laurie</b></font>) just then, for he (<font color='blue'><b>Laurie</b></font>) was
an incorrigible tease, and she (<font color='blue'><b>Amy</b></font>) feared he (<font color='blue'><b>Laurie</b></font>) would coax the secret from her (<font color='blue'><b>Amy</b></font>).

<p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>Amy</b></font>) was quite right, for the mischief-loving lad no sooner suspected a
mystery than he (<font color='blue'><b>lad</b></font>) set himself to find it out, and led Jo a trying life of
it. He (<font color='blue'><b>lad</b></font>) wheedled, bribed, ridiculed, threatened, and scolded; affected
indifference, that he (<font color='blue'><b>lad</b></font>) might surprise the truth from her (<font color='blue'><b>Jo</b></font>); declared he (<font color='blue'><b>lad</b></font>)
knew, then that he (<font color='blue'><b>lad</b></font>) didn't care; and at last, by dint of perseverance,
he (<font color='blue'><b>lad</b></font>) satisfied himself that it concerned Meg and Mr. Brooke. Feeling
indignant that he (<font color='blue'><b>Brooke</b></font>) was not taken into his (<font color='blue'><b>Brooke</b></font>) tutor's confidence, he (<font color='blue'><b>Brooke</b></font>) set his (<font color='blue'><b>Brooke</b></font>)
wits to work to devise some proper retaliation for the slight.

<p/>Meg meanwhile had apparently forgotten the matter and was absorbed in
preparations for her (<font color='blue'><b>Meg</b></font>) father's return, but all of a sudden a change
seemed to come over her (<font color='blue'><b>Meg</b></font>), and, for a day or two, she (<font color='blue'><b>Meg</b></font>) was quite unlike
herself. She (<font color='blue'><b>Meg</b></font>) started when spoken to, blushed when looked at, was very
quiet, and sat over her (<font color='blue'><b>Meg</b></font>) sewing, with a timid, troubled look on her (<font color='blue'><b>Meg</b></font>)
face. To her (<font color='blue'><b>Meg</b></font>) mother's inquiries she (<font color='blue'><b>Meg</b></font>) answered that she (<font color='blue'><b>Meg</b></font>) was quite well,
and Jo's she (<font color='blue'><b>Jo</b></font>) silenced by begging to be let alone.

<p/>``She (<font color='blue'><b>Mother</b></font>) feels it in the air--love, I mean--and she (<font color='blue'><b>Mother</b></font>)'s going very fast.
She (<font color='blue'><b>Mother</b></font>)'s got most of the symptoms--is twittery and cross, doesn't eat,
lies awake, and mopes in corners. I caught her (<font color='blue'><b>Mother</b></font>) singing that song he (<font color='blue'><b>my</b></font>)
gave her (<font color='blue'><b>Mother</b></font>), and once she (<font color='blue'><b>Mother</b></font>) said <div class="bookquote">``John', as you do, and then turned as red
as a poppy. Whatever shall we do?''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>said Jo, looking ready for any
measures, however violent.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Nothing but wait. Let her (<font color='blue'><b>Mother</b></font>) alone, be kind and patient, and Father's
coming will settle everything,''  (<font color='red'><b>mother</b></font>)</div>replied her (<font color='blue'><b>Jo</b></font>) mother.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Here's a note to you, Meg, all sealed up. How odd! Teddy never seals
mine,''  (<font color='red'><b>Jo/Miss Jo/JO</b></font>)</div>said Jo next day, as she (<font color='blue'><b>Jo</b></font>) distributed the contents of the little
post office.

<p/>Mrs. March and Jo were deep in their own affairs, when a sound from Meg
made them look up to see her (<font color='blue'><b>Meg</b></font>) staring at her (<font color='blue'><b>Meg</b></font>) note with a frightened face.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``My child, what is it?''  (<font color='red'><b>mother</b></font>)</div>cried her (<font color='blue'><b>Meg</b></font>) mother, running to her (<font color='blue'><b>Meg</b></font>), while Jo
tried to take the paper which had done the mischief.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``It's all a mistake, he (<font color='blue'><b>Teddy</b></font>) didn't send it. Oh, Jo, how could you do it?''
 (<font color='red'><b>Meg</b></font>)</div>and Meg hid her (<font color='blue'><b>Meg</b></font>) face in her (<font color='blue'><b>Meg</b></font>) hands, crying as if her (<font color='blue'><b>Meg</b></font>) heart were quite
broken.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Me! I've done nothing! What's she (<font color='blue'><b>Jo</b></font>) talking about?''  (<font color='red'><b>Jo/Miss Jo/JO</b></font>)</div>cried Jo,
bewildered.

<p/>Meg's mild eyes kindled with anger as she (<font color='blue'><b>Meg</b></font>) pulled a crumpled note from
her (<font color='blue'><b>Meg</b></font>) pocket and threw it at Jo, saying reproachfully, <div class="bookquote">``You wrote it, and
that bad boy helped you. How could you be so rude, so mean, and cruel
to us both?''

 (<font color='red'><b>Jo/Miss Jo/JO</b></font>)</div><p/>Jo hardly heard her (<font color='blue'><b>Jo</b></font>), for she (<font color='blue'><b>Jo</b></font>) and her (<font color='blue'><b>Jo</b></font>) mother were reading the note,
which was written in a peculiar hand.


<p/>``My Dearest Margaret,

<p/>``I can no longer restrain my passion, and must know my fate before I
return. I dare not tell your parents yet, but I think they would
consent if they knew that we adored one another. Mr. Laurence will
help me to some good place, and then, my sweet girl, you will make me
happy. I implore you to say nothing to your family yet, but to send
one word of hope through Laurie to,

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Your devoted John.''


 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Oh, the little villain! That's the way he (<font color='blue'><b>villain</b></font>) meant to pay me for keeping
my word to Mother. I'll give him (<font color='blue'><b>villain</b></font>) a hearty scolding and bring him (<font color='blue'><b>villain</b></font>) over
to beg pardon,''  (<font color='red'><b>Jo/Miss Jo/JO</b></font>)</div>cried Jo, burning to execute immediate justice. But
her (<font color='blue'><b>Jo</b></font>) mother held her (<font color='blue'><b>Jo</b></font>) back, saying, with a look she (<font color='blue'><b>Jo</b></font>) seldom wore...

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Stop, Jo, you must clear yourself first. You have played so many
pranks that I am afraid you have had a hand in this.''

 (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``On my word, Mother, I haven't! I never saw that note before, and
don't know anything about it, as true as I live!''  (<font color='red'><b>Jo/Miss Jo/JO</b></font>)</div>said Jo, so earnestly
that they believed her (<font color='blue'><b>Jo</b></font>). <div class="bookquote">``If I had taken part in it I'd have done it
better than this, and have written a sensible note. I should think
you'd have known Mr. Brooke wouldn't write such stuff as that,''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Jo</b></font>)
added, scornfully tossing down the paper.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``It's like his (<font color='blue'><b>Brooke</b></font>) writing,''  (<font color='red'><b>Meg</b></font>)</div>faltered Meg, comparing it with the note in
her (<font color='blue'><b>Meg</b></font>) hand.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Oh, Meg, you didn't answer it?''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>cried Mrs. March quickly.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Yes, I did!''  (<font color='red'><b>Meg</b></font>)</div>and Meg hid her (<font color='blue'><b>Meg</b></font>) face again, overcome with shame.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Here's a scrape! Do let me bring that wicked boy over to explain and
be lectured. I can't rest till I get hold of him (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>).''  (<font color='red'><b>Jo/Miss Jo/JO</b></font>)</div>And Jo made for the
door again.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Hush! Let me handle this, for it is worse than I thought. Margaret,
tell me the whole story,''  (<font color='red'><b>Meg</b></font>)</div>commanded Mrs. March, sitting down by Meg,
yet keeping hold of Jo, lest she (<font color='blue'><b>Jo</b></font>) should fly off.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``I received the first letter from Laurie, who didn't look as if he (<font color='blue'><b>Laurie</b></font>) knew
anything about it,''  (<font color='red'><b>Meg</b></font>)</div>began Meg, without looking up. <div class="bookquote">``I was worried at
first and meant to tell you, then I remembered how you liked Mr.
Brooke, so I thought you wouldn't mind if I kept my little secret for a
few days. I'm so silly that I liked to think no one knew, and while I
was deciding what to say, I felt like the girls in books, who have such
things to do. Forgive me, Mother, I'm paid for my silliness now. I
never can look him (<font color='blue'><b>Brooke</b></font>) in the face again.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``What did you say to him (<font color='blue'><b>Brooke</b></font>)?''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>asked Mrs. March.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``I only said I was too young to do anything about it yet, that I didn't
wish to have secrets from you, and he (<font color='blue'><b>Brooke</b></font>) must speak to father. I was very
grateful for his (<font color='blue'><b>Brooke</b></font>) kindness, and would be his (<font color='blue'><b>Brooke</b></font>) friend, but nothing more,
for a long while.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Jo/Miss Jo/JO</b></font>)</div><p/>Mrs. March smiled, as if well pleased, and Jo clapped her (<font color='blue'><b>Jo</b></font>) hands,
exclaiming, with a laugh, <div class="bookquote">``You are almost equal to Caroline Percy, who
was a pattern of prudence! Tell on, Meg. What did he (<font color='blue'><b>Percy</b></font>) say to that?''

 (<font color='red'><b>Jo/Miss Jo/JO</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``He (<font color='blue'><b>Percy</b></font>) writes in a different way entirely, telling me that he (<font color='blue'><b>Percy</b></font>) never sent
any love letter at all, and is very sorry that my roguish sister, Jo,
should take liberties with our names. It's very kind and respectful,
but think how dreadful for me!''

 (<font color='red'><b>Meg</b></font>)</div><p/>Meg leaned against her (<font color='blue'><b>Meg</b></font>) mother, looking the image of despair, and Jo
tramped about the room, calling Laurie names. All of a sudden she (<font color='blue'><b>Jo</b></font>)
stopped, caught up the two notes, and after looking at them closely,
said decidedly, <div class="bookquote">``I don't believe Brooke ever saw either of these
letters. Teddy wrote both, and keeps yours to crow over me with
because I wouldn't tell him (<font color='blue'><b>Teddy</b></font>) my secret.''

 (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Don't have any secrets, Jo. Tell it to Mother and keep out of
trouble, as I should have done,''  (<font color='red'><b>Meg</b></font>)</div>said Meg warningly.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Bless you, child! Mother told me.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``That will do, Jo. I'll comfort Meg while you go and get Laurie. I
shall sift the matter to the bottom, and put a stop to such pranks at
once.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Jo/Miss Jo/JO</b></font>)</div><p/>Away ran Jo, and Mrs. March gently told Meg Mr. Brooke's real feelings.
<div class="bookquote">``Now, dear, what are your own? Do you love him (<font color='blue'><b>Laurie</b></font>) enough to wait till he (<font color='blue'><b>Laurie</b></font>)
can make a home for you, or will you keep yourself quite free for the
present?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I've been so scared and worried, I don't want to have anything to do
with lovers for a long while, perhaps never,''  (<font color='red'><b>Meg</b></font>)</div>answered Meg petulantly.
<div class="bookquote">``If John doesn't know anything about this nonsense, don't tell him (<font color='blue'><b>Laurie</b></font>), and
make Jo and Laurie hold their tongues. I won't be deceived and plagued
and made a fool of. It's a shame!''

 (<font color='red'><b>Meg</b></font>)</div><p/>Seeing Meg's usually gentle temper was roused and her (<font color='blue'><b>Meg</b></font>) pride hurt by
this mischievous joke, Mrs. March soothed her (<font color='blue'><b>Meg</b></font>) by promises of entire
silence and great discretion for the future. The instant Laurie's step
was heard in the hall, Meg fled into the study, and Mrs. March received
the culprit alone. Jo had not told him (<font color='blue'><b>culprit</b></font>) why he (<font color='blue'><b>culprit</b></font>) was wanted, fearing he (<font color='blue'><b>culprit</b></font>)
wouldn't come, but he (<font color='blue'><b>culprit</b></font>) knew the minute he (<font color='blue'><b>culprit</b></font>) saw Mrs. March's face, and
stood twirling his (<font color='blue'><b>culprit</b></font>) hat with a guilty air which convicted him (<font color='blue'><b>culprit</b></font>) at once.
Jo was dismissed, but chose to march up and down the hall like a
sentinel, having some fear that the prisoner might bolt. The sound of
voices in the parlor rose and fell for half an hour, but what happened
during that interview the girls never knew.

<p/>When they were called in, Laurie was standing by their mother with such
a penitent face that Jo forgave him (<font color='blue'><b>Laurie</b></font>) on the spot, but did not think it
wise to betray the fact. Meg received his (<font color='blue'><b>Laurie</b></font>) humble apology, and was much
comforted by the assurance that Brooke knew nothing of the joke.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``I'll never tell him (<font color='blue'><b>fool</b></font>) to my dying day, wild horses shan't drag it out of
me, so you'll forgive me, Meg, and I'll do anything to show how
out-and-out sorry I am,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Brooke</b></font>) added, looking very much ashamed of himself.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``I'll try, but it was a very ungentlemanly thing to do, I didn't think
you could be so sly and malicious, Laurie,''  (<font color='red'><b>Meg</b></font>)</div>replied Meg, trying to hide
her (<font color='blue'><b>Meg</b></font>) maidenly confusion under a gravely reproachful air.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``It was altogether abominable, and I don't deserve to be spoken to for
a month, but you will, though, won't you?''  (<font color='red'><b>Laurie/Mr. Laurie/LAURIE</b></font>)</div>And Laurie folded his (<font color='blue'><b>Laurie</b></font>) hands
together with such and imploring gesture, as he (<font color='blue'><b>Laurie</b></font>) spoke in his (<font color='blue'><b>Laurie</b></font>)
irresistibly persuasive tone, that it was impossible to frown upon him (<font color='blue'><b>Laurie</b></font>)
in spite of his (<font color='blue'><b>Laurie</b></font>) scandalous behavior.

<p/>Meg pardoned him (<font color='blue'><b>Laurie</b></font>), and Mrs. March's grave face relaxed, in spite of her (<font color='blue'><b>Meg</b></font>)
efforts to keep sober, when she (<font color='blue'><b>Meg</b></font>) heard him (<font color='blue'><b>Laurie</b></font>) declare that he (<font color='blue'><b>Laurie</b></font>) would atone
for his (<font color='blue'><b>Laurie</b></font>) sins by all sorts of penances, and abase himself like a worm
before the injured damsel.

<p/>Jo stood aloof, meanwhile, trying to harden her (<font color='blue'><b>Jo</b></font>) heart against him (<font color='blue'><b>Laurie</b></font>), and
succeeding only in primming up her (<font color='blue'><b>Jo</b></font>) face into an expression of entire
disapprobation. Laurie looked at her (<font color='blue'><b>Jo</b></font>) once or twice, but as she (<font color='blue'><b>Jo</b></font>) showed
no sign of relenting, he (<font color='blue'><b>Laurie</b></font>) felt injured, and turned his (<font color='blue'><b>Laurie</b></font>) back on her (<font color='blue'><b>Jo</b></font>) till
the others were done with him (<font color='blue'><b>Laurie</b></font>), when he (<font color='blue'><b>Laurie</b></font>) made her (<font color='blue'><b>Jo</b></font>) a low bow and walked
off without a word.

<p/>As soon as he (<font color='blue'><b>Laurie</b></font>) had gone, she (<font color='blue'><b>Jo</b></font>) wished she (<font color='blue'><b>Jo</b></font>) had been more forgiving, and
when Meg and her (<font color='blue'><b>Meg</b></font>) mother went upstairs, she (<font color='blue'><b>Meg</b></font>) felt lonely and longed for
Teddy. After resisting for some time, she (<font color='blue'><b>Meg</b></font>) yielded to the impulse, and
armed with a book to return, went over to the big house.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Is Mr. Laurence in?''  (<font color='red'><b>Jo/Miss Jo/JO</b></font>)</div>asked Jo, of a housemaid, who was coming
downstairs.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Yes, Miss, but I don't believe he (<font color='blue'><b>Laurence</b></font>)'s seeable just yet.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Why not? Is he (<font color='blue'><b>Laurence</b></font>) ill?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``La, no Miss, but he (<font color='blue'><b>Laurence</b></font>)'s had a scene with Mr. Laurie, who is in one of
his (<font color='blue'><b>Laurie</b></font>) tantrums about something, which vexes the old gentleman, so I
dursn't go nigh him (<font color='blue'><b>Laurie</b></font>).''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Where is Laurie?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Shut up in his (<font color='blue'><b>Laurie</b></font>) room, and he (<font color='blue'><b>Laurie</b></font>) won't answer, though I've been a-tapping.
I don't know what's to become of the dinner, for it's ready, and
there's no one to eat it.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I'll go and see what the matter is. I'm not afraid of either of them.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Jo/Miss Jo/JO</b></font>)</div><p/>Up went Jo, and knocked smartly on the door of Laurie's little study.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Stop that, or I'll open the door and make you!''  (<font color='red'><b>the gentleman</b></font>)</div>called out the young
gentleman in a threatening tone.

<p/>Jo immediately knocked again. The door flew open, and in she (<font color='blue'><b>Jo</b></font>) bounced
before Laurie could recover from his (<font color='blue'><b>Laurie</b></font>) surprise. Seeing that he (<font color='blue'><b>Laurie</b></font>) really
was out of temper, Jo, who knew how to manage him (<font color='blue'><b>Laurie</b></font>), assumed a contrite
expression, and going artistically down upon her (<font color='blue'><b>Jo</b></font>) knees, said meekly,
<div class="bookquote">``Please forgive me for being so cross. I came to make it up, and can't
go away till I have.''

 (<font color='red'><b>him</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``It's all right. Get up, and don't be a goose, Jo,''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>was the cavalier
reply to her (<font color='blue'><b>Jo</b></font>) petition.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Thank you, I will. Could I ask what's the matter? You don't look
exactly easy in your mind.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I've been shaken, and I won't bear it!''  (<font color='red'><b>Laurie/Mr. Laurie/LAURIE</b></font>)</div>growled Laurie indignantly.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Who did it?''  (<font color='red'><b>Jo/Miss Jo/JO</b></font>)</div>demanded Jo.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Grandfather. If it had been anyone else I'd have...''  (<font color='red'><b>the youth</b></font>)</div>And the injured
youth finished his (<font color='blue'><b>Laurie</b></font>) sentence by an energetic gesture of the right arm.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``That's nothing. I often shake you, and you don't mind,''  (<font color='red'><b>Jo/Miss Jo/JO</b></font>)</div>said Jo
soothingly.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Pooh! You're a girl, and it's fun, but I'll allow no man to shake me!''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I don't think anyone would care to try it, if you looked as much like
a thundercloud as you do now. Why were you treated so?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Just because I wouldn't say what your mother wanted me for. I'd
promised not to tell, and of course I wasn't going to break my word.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Couldn't you satisfy your grandpa in any other way?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``No, he (<font color='blue'><b>grandpa</b></font>) would have the truth, the whole truth, and nothing but the
truth. I'd have told my part of the scrape, if I could without
bringing Meg in. As I couldn't, I held my tongue, and bore the
scolding till the old gentleman collared me. Then I bolted, for fear I
should forget myself.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``It wasn't nice, but he (<font color='blue'><b>gentleman</b></font>)'s sorry, I know, so go down and make up. I'll
help you.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Hanged if I do! I'm not going to be lectured and pummelled by
everyone, just for a bit of a frolic. I was sorry about Meg, and
begged pardon like a man, but I won't do it again, when I wasn't in the
wrong.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``He (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) didn't know that.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``He (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) ought to trust me, and not act as if I was a baby. It's no use,
Jo, he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>)'s got to learn that I'm able to take care of myself, and don't
need anyone's apron string to hold on by.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``What pepper pots you are!''  (<font color='red'><b>Jo/Miss Jo/JO</b></font>)</div>sighed Jo. <div class="bookquote">``How do you mean to settle this
affair?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Well, he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) ought to beg pardon, and believe me when I say I can't tell
him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) what the fuss's about.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Bless you! He (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) won't do that.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I won't go down till he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) does.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Now, Teddy, be sensible. Let it pass, and I'll explain what I can.
You can't stay here, so what's the use of being melodramatic?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I don't intend to stay here long, anyway. I'll slip off and take a
journey somewhere, and when Grandpa misses me he (<font color='blue'><b>Grandpa</b></font>)'ll come round fast
enough.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I dare say, but you ought not to go and worry him (<font color='blue'><b>Grandpa</b></font>).''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Don't preach. I'll go to Washington and see Brooke. It's gay there,
and I'll enjoy myself after the troubles.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``What fun you'd have! I wish I could run off too,''  (<font color='red'><b>Jo/Miss Jo/JO</b></font>)</div>said Jo, forgetting
her (<font color='blue'><b>Jo</b></font>) part of mentor in lively visions of martial life at the capital.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Come on, then! Why not? You go and surprise your father, and I'll
stir up old Brooke. It would be a glorious joke. Let's do it, Jo.
We'll leave a letter saying we are all right, and trot off at once.
I've got money enough. It will do you good, and no harm, as you go to
your father.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Jo/Miss Jo/JO</b></font>)</div><p/>For a moment Jo looked as if she (<font color='blue'><b>Jo</b></font>) would agree, for wild as the plan was,
it just suited her (<font color='blue'><b>Jo</b></font>). She (<font color='blue'><b>Jo</b></font>) was tired of care and confinement, longed for
change, and thoughts of her (<font color='blue'><b>Jo</b></font>) father blended temptingly with the novel
charms of camps and hospitals, liberty and fun. Her (<font color='blue'><b>Jo</b></font>) eyes kindled as
they turned wistfully toward the window, but they fell on the old house
opposite, and she (<font color='blue'><b>Jo</b></font>) shook her (<font color='blue'><b>Jo</b></font>) head with sorrowful decision.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``If I was a boy, we'd run away together, and have a capital time, but
as I'm a miserable girl, I must be proper and stop at home. Don't tempt
me, Teddy, it's a crazy plan.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``That's the fun of it,''  (<font color='red'><b>Laurie/Mr. Laurie/LAURIE</b></font>)</div>began Laurie, who had got a willful fit on him (<font color='blue'><b>Laurie</b></font>)
and was possessed to break out of bounds in some way.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Hold your tongue!''  (<font color='red'><b>Jo/Miss Jo/JO</b></font>)</div>cried Jo, covering her (<font color='blue'><b>Jo</b></font>) ears. <div class="bookquote">''`Prunes and prisms'
are my doom, and I may as well make up my mind to it. I came here to
moralize, not to hear things that make me skip to think of.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Jo/Miss Jo/JO</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I know Meg would wet-blanket such a proposal, but I thought you had
more spirit,''  (<font color='red'><b>Laurie/Mr. Laurie/LAURIE</b></font>)</div>began Laurie insinuatingly.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Bad boy, be quiet! Sit down and think of your own sins, don't go
making me add to mine. If I get your grandpa to apologize for the
shaking, will you give up running away?''  (<font color='red'><b>Jo/Miss Jo/JO</b></font>)</div>asked Jo seriously.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Yes, but you won't do it,''  (<font color='red'><b>Laurie/Mr. Laurie/LAURIE</b></font>)</div>answered Laurie, who wished to make up, but
felt that his (<font color='blue'><b>Laurie</b></font>) outraged dignity must be appeased first.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``If I can manage the young one, I can the old one,''  (<font color='red'><b>Jo/Miss Jo/JO</b></font>)</div>muttered Jo, as she (<font color='blue'><b>Jo</b></font>)
walked away, leaving Laurie bent over a railroad map with his (<font color='blue'><b>Laurie</b></font>) head
propped up on both hands.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Come in!''  (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Laurence/Laurence/LAURENCE</b></font>)</div>and Mr. Laurence's gruff voice sounded gruffer than ever, as
Jo tapped at his (<font color='blue'><b>Laurence</b></font>) door.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``It's only me, Sir, come to return a book,''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Jo</b></font>) said blandly, as she (<font color='blue'><b>Jo</b></font>)
entered.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Want any more?''  (<font color='red'><b>the gentleman</b></font>)</div>asked the old gentleman, looking grim and vexed, but
trying not to show it.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Yes, please. I like old Sam so well, I think I'll try the second
volume,''  (<font color='red'><b>Jo/Miss Jo/JO</b></font>)</div>returned Jo, hoping to propitiate him (<font color='blue'><b>Laurence</b></font>) by accepting a second
dose of Boswell's Johnson, as he (<font color='blue'><b>Johnson</b></font>) had recommended that lively work.

<p/>The shaggy eyebrows unbent a little as he (<font color='blue'><b>Johnson</b></font>) rolled the steps toward the
shelf where the Johnsonian literature was placed. Jo skipped up, and
sitting on the top step, affected to be searching for her (<font color='blue'><b>Jo</b></font>) book, but was
really wondering how best to introduce the dangerous object of her (<font color='blue'><b>Jo</b></font>)
visit. Mr. Laurence seemed to suspect that something was brewing in
her (<font color='blue'><b>Jo</b></font>) mind, for after taking several brisk turns about the room, he (<font color='blue'><b>Laurence</b></font>) faced
round on her (<font color='blue'><b>Jo</b></font>), speaking so abruptly that Rasselas tumbled face downward
on the floor.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``What has that boy been about? Don't try to shield him (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>). I know he (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>) has
been in mischief by the way he (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>) acted when he (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>) came home. I can't get a
word from him (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>), and when I threatened to shake the truth out of him (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>) he (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>)
bolted upstairs and locked himself into his (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>) room.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``He (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>) did wrong, but we forgave him (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>), and all promised not to say a word
to anyone,''  (<font color='red'><b>Jo/Miss Jo/JO</b></font>)</div>began Jo reluctantly.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``That won't do. He (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>) shall not shelter himself behind a promise from you
softhearted girls. If he (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>)'s done anything amiss, he (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>) shall confess, beg
pardon, and be punished. Out with it, Jo. I won't be kept in the dark.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Laurence/Laurence/LAURENCE</b></font>)</div><p/>Mr. Laurence looked so alarming and spoke so sharply that Jo would have
gladly run away, if she (<font color='blue'><b>Jo</b></font>) could, but she (<font color='blue'><b>Jo</b></font>) was perched aloft on the steps,
and he (<font color='blue'><b>Laurence</b></font>) stood at the foot, a lion in the path, so she (<font color='blue'><b>Jo</b></font>) had to stay and
brave it out.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Indeed, Sir, I cannot tell. Mother forbade it. Laurie has confessed,
asked pardon, and been punished quite enough. We don't keep silence to
shield him (<font color='blue'><b>Laurie</b></font>), but someone else, and it will make more trouble if you
interfere. Please don't. It was partly my fault, but it's all right
now. So let's forget it, and talk about the _Rambler_ or something
pleasant.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Hang the _Rambler!_ Come down and give me your word that this
harum-scarum boy of mine hasn't done anything ungrateful or
impertinent. If he (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>) has, after all your kindness to him (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>), I'll thrash
him (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>) with my own hands.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Jo/Miss Jo/JO</b></font>)</div><p/>The threat sounded awful, but did not alarm Jo, for she (<font color='blue'><b>Jo</b></font>) knew the
irascible old gentleman would never lift a finger against his (<font color='blue'><b>gentleman</b></font>) grandson,
whatever he (<font color='blue'><b>gentleman</b></font>) might say to the contrary. She (<font color='blue'><b>Jo</b></font>) obediently descended, and
made as light of the prank as she (<font color='blue'><b>Jo</b></font>) could without betraying Meg or
forgetting the truth.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Hum... ha... well, if the boy held his (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>) tongue because he (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>) promised, and
not from obstinacy, I'll forgive him (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>). He (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>)'s a stubborn fellow and hard
to manage,''  (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Laurence/Laurence/LAURENCE</b></font>)</div>said Mr. Laurence, rubbing up his (<font color='blue'><b>Laurence</b></font>) hair till it looked as if
he (<font color='blue'><b>Laurence</b></font>) had been out in a gale, and smoothing the frown from his (<font color='blue'><b>Laurence</b></font>) brow with
an air of relief.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``So am I, but a kind word will govern me when all the king's horses and
all the king's men couldn't,''  (<font color='red'><b>Jo/Miss Jo/JO</b></font>)</div>said Jo, trying to say a kind word for
her (<font color='blue'><b>Jo</b></font>) friend, who seemed to get out of one scrape only to fall into
another.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``You think I'm not kind to him (<font color='blue'><b>king</b></font>), hey?''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>was the sharp answer.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Oh, dear no, Sir. You are rather too kind sometimes, and then just a
trifle hasty when he (<font color='blue'><b>king</b></font>) tries your patience. Don't you think you are?''

 (<font color='red'><b>Jo/Miss Jo/JO</b></font>)</div><p/>Jo was determined to have it out now, and tried to look quite placid,
though she (<font color='blue'><b>Jo</b></font>) quaked a little after her (<font color='blue'><b>Jo</b></font>) bold speech. To her (<font color='blue'><b>Jo</b></font>) great relief
and surprise, the old gentleman only threw his (<font color='blue'><b>gentleman</b></font>) spectacles onto the
table with a rattle and exclaimed frankly, <div class="bookquote">``You're right, girl, I am!
I love the boy, but he (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>) tries my patience past bearing, and I know how
it will end, if we go on so.''

 (<font color='red'><b>the gentleman</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I'll tell you, he (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>)'ll run away.''  (<font color='red'><b>Jo/Miss Jo/JO</b></font>)</div>Jo was sorry for that speech the
minute it was made. She (<font color='blue'><b>Jo</b></font>) meant to warn him (<font color='blue'><b>gentleman</b></font>) that Laurie would not bear
much restraint, and hoped he (<font color='blue'><b>Laurie</b></font>) would be more forebearing with the lad.

<p/>Mr. Laurence's ruddy face changed suddenly, and he (<font color='blue'><b>Laurence</b></font>) sat down, with a
troubled glance at the picture of a handsome man, which hung over his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>)
table. It was Laurie's father, who had run away in his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) youth, and
married against the imperious old man's will. Jo fancied he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) remembered
and regretted the past, and she (<font color='blue'><b>Jo</b></font>) wished she (<font color='blue'><b>Jo</b></font>) had held her (<font color='blue'><b>Jo</b></font>) tongue.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``He (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>) won't do it unless he (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>) is very much worried, and only threatens it
sometimes, when he (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>) gets tired of studying. I often think I should like
to, especially since my hair was cut, so if you ever miss us, you may
advertise for two boys and look among the ships bound for India.''

 (<font color='red'><b>She</b></font>)</div><p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>Jo</b></font>) laughed as she (<font color='blue'><b>Jo</b></font>) spoke, and Mr. Laurence looked relieved, evidently
taking the whole as a joke.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``You hussy, how dare you talk in that way? Where's your respect for
me, and your proper bringing up? Bless the boys and girls! What
torments they are, yet we can't do without them,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Laurence</b></font>) said, pinching her (<font color='blue'><b>Jo</b></font>)
cheeks good-humoredly. <div class="bookquote">``Go and bring that boy down to his (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>) dinner, tell
him (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>) it's all right, and advise him (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>) not to put on tragedy airs with his (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>)
grandfather. I won't bear it.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``He (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>) won't come, Sir. He (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>) feels badly because you didn't believe him (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>)
when he (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>) said he (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>) couldn't tell. I think the shaking hurt his (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>) feelings
very much.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Jo/Miss Jo/JO</b></font>)</div><p/>Jo tried to look pathetic but must have failed, for Mr. Laurence began
to laugh, and she (<font color='blue'><b>Jo</b></font>) knew the day was won.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``I'm sorry for that, and ought to thank him (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>) for not shaking me, I
suppose. What the dickens does the fellow expect?''  (<font color='red'><b>the gentleman</b></font>)</div>and the old
gentleman looked a trifle ashamed of his (<font color='blue'><b>gentleman</b></font>) own testiness.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``If I were you, I'd write him (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>) an apology, Sir. He (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>) says he (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>) won't come
down till he (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>) has one, and talks about Washington, and goes on in an
absurd way. A formal apology will make him (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>) see how foolish he (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>) is, and
bring him (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>) down quite amiable. Try it. He (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>) likes fun, and this way is
better than talking. I'll carry it up, and teach him (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>) his (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>) duty.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Laurence/Laurence/LAURENCE</b></font>)</div><p/>Mr. Laurence gave her (<font color='blue'><b>Jo</b></font>) a sharp look, and put on his (<font color='blue'><b>Laurence</b></font>) spectacles, saying
slowly, <div class="bookquote">``You're a sly puss, but I don't mind being managed by you and
Beth. Here, give me a bit of paper, and let us have done with this
nonsense.''

 (<font color='red'><b>her</b></font>)</div><p/>The note was written in the terms which one gentleman would use to
another after offering some deep insult. Jo dropped a kiss on the top
of Mr. Laurence's bald head, and ran up to slip the apology under
Laurie's door, advising him (<font color='blue'><b>Laurie</b></font>) through the keyhole to be submissive,
decorous, and a few other agreeable impossibilities. Finding the door
locked again, she (<font color='blue'><b>Jo</b></font>) left the note to do its work, and was going quietly
away, when the young gentleman slid down the banisters, and waited for
her (<font color='blue'><b>Jo</b></font>) at the bottom, saying, with his (<font color='blue'><b>gentleman</b></font>) most virtuous expression of
countenance, <div class="bookquote">``What a good fellow you are, Jo! Did you get blown up?''  (<font color='red'><b>the gentleman</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>gentleman</b></font>)
added, laughing.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``No, he (<font color='blue'><b>fellow</b></font>) was pretty mild, on the whole.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Ah! I got it all round. Even you cast me off over there, and I felt
just ready to go to the deuce,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>gentleman</b></font>) began apologetically.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Don't talk that way, turn over a new leaf and begin again, Teddy, my
son.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I keep turning over new leaves, and spoiling them, as I used to spoil
my copybooks, and I make so many beginnings there never will be an
end,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>gentleman</b></font>) said dolefully.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Go and eat your dinner, you'll feel better after it. Men always croak
when they are hungry,''  (<font color='red'><b>Jo/Miss Jo/JO</b></font>)</div>and Jo whisked out at the front door after that.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``That's a `label' on my `sect',''  (<font color='red'><b>Laurie/Mr. Laurie/LAURIE</b></font>)</div>answered Laurie, quoting Amy, as he (<font color='blue'><b>Laurie</b></font>)
went to partake of humble pie dutifully with his (<font color='blue'><b>Laurie</b></font>) grandfather, who was
quite saintly in temper and overwhelmingly respectful in manner all the
rest of the day.

<p/>Everyone thought the matter ended and the little cloud blown over, but
the mischief was done, for though others forgot it, Meg remembered.
She (<font color='blue'><b>Meg</b></font>) never alluded to a certain person, but she (<font color='blue'><b>Meg</b></font>) thought of him (<font color='blue'><b>Laurie</b></font>) a good
deal, dreamed dreams more than ever, and once Jo, rummaging her (<font color='blue'><b>Jo</b></font>)
sister's desk for stamps, found a bit of paper scribbled over with the
words, ``Mrs. John Brooke', whereat she (<font color='blue'><b>Brooke</b></font>) groaned tragically and cast it
into the fire, feeling that Laurie's prank had hastened the evil day
for her (<font color='blue'><b>Brooke</b></font>).



<p/>CHAPTER TWENTY-TWO

<p/>PLEASANT MEADOWS

<p/>Like sunshine after a storm were the peaceful weeks which followed.
The invalids improved rapidly, and Mr. March began to talk of returning
early in the new year. Beth was soon able to lie on the study sofa all
day, amusing herself with the well-beloved cats at first, and in time
with doll's sewing, which had fallen sadly behind-hand. Her (<font color='blue'><b>Beth</b></font>) once
active limbs were so stiff and feeble that Jo took her (<font color='blue'><b>Jo</b></font>) for a daily
airing about the house in her (<font color='blue'><b>Jo</b></font>) strong arms. Meg cheerfully blackened
and burned her (<font color='blue'><b>Meg</b></font>) white hands cooking delicate messes for `the dear',
while Amy, a loyal slave of the ring, celebrated her (<font color='blue'><b>Amy</b></font>) return by giving
away as many of her (<font color='blue'><b>Amy</b></font>) treasures as she (<font color='blue'><b>Amy</b></font>) could prevail on her (<font color='blue'><b>Amy</b></font>) sisters to
accept.

<p/>As Christmas approached, the usual mysteries began to haunt the house,
and Jo frequently convulsed the family by proposing utterly impossible
or magnificently absurd ceremonies, in honor of this unusually merry
Christmas. Laurie was equally impracticable, and would have had
bonfires, skyrockets, and triumphal arches, if he (<font color='blue'><b>Laurie</b></font>) had had his (<font color='blue'><b>Laurie</b></font>) own way.
After many skirmishes and snubbings, the ambitious pair were considered
effectually quenched and went about with forlorn faces, which were
rather belied by explosions of laughter when the two got together.

<p/>Several days of unusually mild weather fitly ushered in a splendid
Christmas Day. Hannah `felt in her (<font color='blue'><b>Hannah</b></font>) bones' that it was going to be an
unusually fine day, and she (<font color='blue'><b>Hannah</b></font>) proved herself a true prophetess, for
everybody and everything seemed bound to produce a grand success. To
begin with, Mr. March wrote that he (<font color='blue'><b>March</b></font>) should soon be with them, then Beth
felt uncommonly well that morning, and, being dressed in her (<font color='blue'><b>Beth</b></font>) mother's
gift, a soft crimson merino wrapper, was borne in high triumph to the
window to behold the offering of Jo and Laurie. The Unquenchables had
done their best to be worthy of the name, for like elves they had
worked by night and conjured up a comical surprise. Out in the garden
stood a stately snow maiden, crowned with holly, bearing a basket of
fruit and flowers in one hand, a great roll of music in the other, a
perfect rainbow of an Afghan round her (<font color='blue'><b>Jo</b></font>) chilly shoulders, and a
Christmas carol issuing from her (<font color='blue'><b>Jo</b></font>) lips on a pink paper streamer.

<p/>THE JUNGFRAU TO BETH

<p/>God bless you, dear Queen Bess!
May nothing you dismay,
But health and peace and happiness
Be yours, this Christmas day.

<p/>Here's fruit to feed our busy bee,
And flowers for her (<font color='blue'><b>Queen</b></font>) nose.
Here's music for her (<font color='blue'><b>Queen</b></font>) pianee,
An afghan for her (<font color='blue'><b>Queen</b></font>) toes,

<p/>A portrait of Joanna, see,
By Raphael No. 2,
Who laboured with great industry
To make it fair and true.

<p/>Accept a ribbon red, I beg,
For Madam Purrer's tail,
And ice cream made by lovely Peg,
A Mont Blanc in a pail.

<p/>Their dearest love my makers laid
Within my breast of snow.
Accept it, and the Alpine maid,
From Laurie and from Jo.

<p/>How Beth laughed when she (<font color='blue'><b>Beth</b></font>) saw it, how Laurie ran up and down to bring
in the gifts, and what ridiculous speeches Jo made as she (<font color='blue'><b>Jo</b></font>) presented
them.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``I'm so full of happiness, that if Father was only here, I couldn't
hold one drop more,''  (<font color='red'><b>Beth</b></font>)</div>said Beth, quite sighing with contentment as Jo
carried her (<font color='blue'><b>Jo</b></font>) off to the study to rest after the excitement, and to
refresh herself with some of the delicious grapes the ``Jungfrau' had
sent her (<font color='blue'><b>Jo</b></font>).

<p/><div class="bookquote">``So am I,''  (<font color='red'><b>Jo/Miss Jo/JO</b></font>)</div>added Jo, slapping the pocket wherein reposed the
long-desired _Undine and Sintram_.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``I'm sure I am,''  (<font color='red'><b>Amy/Amy March</b></font>)</div>echoed Amy, poring over the engraved copy of the
Madonna and Child, which her (<font color='blue'><b>Madonna</b></font>) mother had given her (<font color='blue'><b>Madonna</b></font>) in a pretty frame.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Of course I am!''  (<font color='red'><b>Meg</b></font>)</div>cried Meg, smoothing the silvery folds of her (<font color='blue'><b>Madonna</b></font>) first
silk dress, for Mr. Laurence had insisted on giving it. <div class="bookquote">``How can I be
otherwise?''  (<font color='red'><b>husband</b></font>)</div>said Mrs. March gratefully, as her (<font color='blue'><b>Madonna</b></font>) eyes went from her (<font color='blue'><b>Madonna</b></font>)
husband's letter to Beth's smiling face, and her (<font color='blue'><b>Beth</b></font>) hand caressed the
brooch made of gray and golden, chestnut and dark brown hair, which the
girls had just fastened on her (<font color='blue'><b>Beth</b></font>) breast.

<p/>Now and then, in this workaday world, things do happen in the
delightful storybook fashion, and what a comfort it is. Half an hour
after everyone had said they were so happy they could only hold one
drop more, the drop came. Laurie opened the parlor door and popped his (<font color='blue'><b>Laurie</b></font>)
head in very quietly. He (<font color='blue'><b>Laurie</b></font>) might just as well have turned a somersault
and uttered an Indian war whoop, for his (<font color='blue'><b>Laurie</b></font>) face was so full of suppressed
excitement and his (<font color='blue'><b>Laurie</b></font>) voice so treacherously joyful that everyone jumped
up, though he (<font color='blue'><b>Laurie</b></font>) only said, in a queer, breathless voice, <div class="bookquote">``Here's another
Christmas present for the March family.''

 (<font color='red'><b>a queer</b></font>)</div><p/>Before the words were well out of his (<font color='blue'><b>Laurie</b></font>) mouth, he (<font color='blue'><b>Laurie</b></font>) was whisked away
somehow, and in his (<font color='blue'><b>Laurie</b></font>) place appeared a tall man, muffled up to the eyes,
leaning on the arm of another tall man, who tried to say something and
couldn't. Of course there was a general stampede, and for several
minutes everybody seemed to lose their wits, for the strangest things
were done, and no one said a word.

<p/>Mr. March became invisible in the embrace of four pairs of loving arms.
Jo disgraced herself by nearly fainting away, and had to be doctored by
Laurie in the china closet. Mr. Brooke kissed Meg entirely by mistake,
as he (<font color='blue'><b>Brooke</b></font>) somewhat incoherently explained. And Amy, the dignified, tumbled
over a stool, and never stopping to get up, hugged and cried over her (<font color='blue'><b>Amy</b></font>)
father's boots in the most touching manner. Mrs. March was the first
to recover herself, and held up her (<font color='blue'><b>Amy</b></font>) hand with a warning, <div class="bookquote">``Hush!
Remember Beth.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/>But it was too late. The study door flew open, the little red wrapper
appeared on the threshold, joy put strength into the feeble limbs, and
Beth ran straight into her (<font color='blue'><b>Beth</b></font>) father's arms. Never mind what happened
just after that, for the full hearts overflowed, washing away the
bitterness of the past and leaving only the sweetness of the present.

<p/>It was not at all romantic, but a hearty laugh set everybody straight
again, for Hannah was discovered behind the door, sobbing over the fat
turkey, which she (<font color='blue'><b>Hannah</b></font>) had forgotten to put down when she (<font color='blue'><b>Hannah</b></font>) rushed up from the
kitchen. As the laugh subsided, Mrs. March began to thank Mr. Brooke
for his (<font color='blue'><b>Brooke</b></font>) faithful care of her (<font color='blue'><b>Hannah</b></font>) husband, at which Mr. Brooke suddenly
remembered that Mr. March needed rest, and seizing Laurie, he (<font color='blue'><b>Laurie</b></font>)
precipitately retired. Then the two invalids were ordered to repose,
which they did, by both sitting in one big chair and talking hard.

<p/>Mr. March told how he (<font color='blue'><b>March</b></font>) had longed to surprise them, and how, when the
fine weather came, he (<font color='blue'><b>March</b></font>) had been allowed by his (<font color='blue'><b>March</b></font>) doctor to take advantage
of it, how devoted Brooke had been, and how he (<font color='blue'><b>Brooke</b></font>) was altogether a most
estimable and upright young man. Why Mr. March paused a minute just
there, and after a glance at Meg, who was violently poking the fire,
looked at his (<font color='blue'><b>Mr.</b></font>) wife with an inquiring lift of the eyebrows, I leave you
to imagine. Also why Mrs. March gently nodded her (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>) head and asked,
rather abruptly, if he (<font color='blue'><b>Mr.</b></font>) wouldn't like to have something to eat. Jo saw
and understood the look, and she (<font color='blue'><b>Jo</b></font>) stalked grimly away to get wine and
beef tea, muttering to herself as she (<font color='blue'><b>Jo</b></font>) slammed the door, <div class="bookquote">``I hate
estimable young men with brown eyes!''

 (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div><p/>There never was such a Christmas dinner as they had that day. The fat
turkey was a sight to behold, when Hannah sent him (<font color='blue'><b>Mr.</b></font>) up, stuffed,
browned, and decorated. So was the plum pudding, which melted in one's
mouth, likewise the jellies, in which Amy reveled like a fly in a
honeypot. Everything turned out well, which was a mercy, Hannah said,
<div class="bookquote">``For my mind was that flustered, Mum, that it's a merrycle I didn't
roast the pudding, and stuff the turkey with raisins, let alone bilin'
of it in a cloth.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Hannah</b></font>)</div><p/>Mr. Laurence and his (<font color='blue'><b>Laurence</b></font>) grandson dined with them, also Mr. Brooke, at whom
Jo glowered darkly, to Laurie's infinite amusement. Two easy chairs
stood side by side at the head of the table, in which sat Beth and her (<font color='blue'><b>Beth</b></font>)
father, feasting modestly on chicken and a little fruit. They drank
healths, told stories, sang songs, `reminisced', as the old folks say,
and had a thoroughly good time. A sleigh ride had been planned, but the
girls would not leave their father, so the guests departed early, and
as twilight gathered, the happy family sat together round the fire.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Just a year ago we were groaning over the dismal Christmas we expected
to have. Do you remember?''  (<font color='red'><b>Jo/Miss Jo/JO</b></font>)</div>asked Jo, breaking a short pause which had
followed a long conversation about many things.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Rather a pleasant year on the whole!''  (<font color='red'><b>Meg</b></font>)</div>said Meg, smiling at the fire,
and congratulating herself on having treated Mr. Brooke with dignity.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``I think it's been a pretty hard one,''  (<font color='red'><b>Amy/Amy March</b></font>)</div>observed Amy, watching the light
shine on her (<font color='blue'><b>Amy</b></font>) ring with thoughtful eyes.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``I'm glad it's over, because we've got you back,''  (<font color='red'><b>Beth</b></font>)</div>whispered Beth, who
sat on her (<font color='blue'><b>Beth</b></font>) father's knee.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Rather a rough road for you to travel, my little pilgrims, especially
the latter part of it. But you have got on bravely, and I think the
burdens are in a fair way to tumble off very soon,''  (<font color='red'><b>Mr.</b></font>)</div>said Mr. March,
looking with fatherly satisfaction at the four young faces gathered
round him (<font color='blue'><b>Mr.</b></font>).

<p/><div class="bookquote">``How do you know? Did Mother tell you?''  (<font color='red'><b>Jo/Miss Jo/JO</b></font>)</div>asked Jo.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Not much. Straws show which way the wind blows, and I've made several
discoveries today.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Oh, tell us what they are!''  (<font color='red'><b>Meg</b></font>)</div>cried Meg, who sat beside him (<font color='blue'><b>Mr.</b></font>).

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Here is one.''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>And taking up the hand which lay on the arm of his (<font color='blue'><b>Mr.</b></font>)
chair, he (<font color='blue'><b>Mr.</b></font>) pointed to the roughened forefinger, a burn on the back, and
two or three little hard spots on the palm. <div class="bookquote">``I remember a time when
this hand was white and smooth, and your first care was to keep it so.
It was very pretty then, but to me it is much prettier now, for in this
seeming blemishes I read a little history. A burnt offering has been
made to vanity, this hardened palm has earned something better than
blisters, and I'm sure the sewing done by these pricked fingers will
last a long time, so much good will went into the stitches. Meg, my
dear, I value the womanly skill which keeps home happy more than white
hands or fashionable accomplishments. I'm proud to shake this good,
industrious little hand, and hope I shall not soon be asked to give it
away.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Meg</b></font>)</div><p/>If Meg had wanted a reward for hours of patient labor, she (<font color='blue'><b>Meg</b></font>) received it
in the hearty pressure of her (<font color='blue'><b>Meg</b></font>) father's hand and the approving smile he (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>)
gave her (<font color='blue'><b>Meg</b></font>).

<p/><div class="bookquote">``What about Jo? Please say something nice, for she (<font color='blue'><b>Jo</b></font>) has tried so hard
and been so very, very good to me,''  (<font color='red'><b>Beth</b></font>)</div>said Beth in her (<font color='blue'><b>Beth</b></font>) father's ear.

<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) laughed and looked across at the tall girl who sat opposite, with an
unusually mild expression in her (<font color='blue'><b>Beth</b></font>) face.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``In spite of the curly crop, I don't see the `son Jo' whom I left a
year ago,''  (<font color='red'><b>Mr.</b></font>)</div>said Mr. March. <div class="bookquote">``I see a young lady who pins her (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) collar
straight, laces her (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) boots neatly, and neither whistles, talks slang,
nor lies on the rug as she (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) used to do. Her (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) face is rather thin and
pale just now, with watching and anxiety, but I like to look at it, for
it has grown gentler, and her (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) voice is lower. She (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) doesn't bounce, but
moves quietly, and takes care of a certain little person in a motherly
way which delights me. I rather miss my wild girl, but if I get a
strong, helpful, tenderhearted woman in her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) place, I shall feel quite
satisfied. I don't know whether the shearing sobered our black sheep,
but I do know that in all Washington I couldn't find anything beautiful
enough to be bought with the five-and-twenty dollars my good girl sent
me.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Jo/Miss Jo/JO</b></font>)</div><p/>Jo's keen eyes were rather dim for a minute, and her (<font color='blue'><b>Jo</b></font>) thin face grew
rosy in the firelight as she (<font color='blue'><b>Jo</b></font>) received her (<font color='blue'><b>Jo</b></font>) father's praise, feeling that
she (<font color='blue'><b>Jo</b></font>) did deserve a portion of it.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Now, Beth,''  (<font color='red'><b>Amy/Amy March</b></font>)</div>said Amy, longing for her (<font color='blue'><b>Amy</b></font>) turn, but ready to wait.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``There's so little of her (<font color='blue'><b>Beth</b></font>), I'm afraid to say much, for fear she (<font color='blue'><b>Beth</b></font>) will
slip away altogether, though she (<font color='blue'><b>Beth</b></font>) is not so shy as she (<font color='blue'><b>Beth</b></font>) used to be,''
 (<font color='red'><b>father</b></font>)</div>began their father cheerfully. But recollecting how nearly he (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) had lost
her (<font color='blue'><b>Amy</b></font>), he (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) held her (<font color='blue'><b>Amy</b></font>) close, saying tenderly, with her (<font color='blue'><b>Amy</b></font>) cheek against his (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>)
own, <div class="bookquote">``I've got you safe, my Beth, and I'll keep you so, please God.''

 (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div><p/>After a minute's silence, he (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) looked down at Amy, who sat on the cricket
at his (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) feet, and said, with a caress of the shining hair...

<p/><div class="bookquote">``I observed that Amy took drumsticks at dinner, ran errands for her (<font color='blue'><b>Amy</b></font>)
mother all the afternoon, gave Meg her (<font color='blue'><b>Meg</b></font>) place tonight, and has waited on
every one with patience and good humor. I also observe that she (<font color='blue'><b>Meg</b></font>) does
not fret much nor look in the glass, and has not even mentioned a very
pretty ring which she (<font color='blue'><b>Meg</b></font>) wears, so I conclude that she (<font color='blue'><b>Meg</b></font>) has learned to
think of other people more and of herself less, and has decided to try
and mold her (<font color='blue'><b>Meg</b></font>) character as carefully as she (<font color='blue'><b>Meg</b></font>) molds her (<font color='blue'><b>Meg</b></font>) little clay
figures. I am glad of this, for though I should be very proud of a
graceful statue made by her (<font color='blue'><b>Meg</b></font>), I shall be infinitely prouder of a lovable
daughter with a talent for making life beautiful to herself and others.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Amy/Amy March</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``What are you thinking of, Beth?''  (<font color='red'><b>Jo/Miss Jo/JO</b></font>)</div>asked Jo, when Amy had thanked her (<font color='blue'><b>Amy</b></font>)
father and told about her (<font color='blue'><b>Amy</b></font>) ring.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``I read in _Pilgrim's Progress_ today how, after many troubles,
Christian and Hopeful came to a pleasant green meadow where lilies
bloomed all year round, and there they rested happily, as we do now,
before they went on to their journey's end,''  (<font color='red'><b>Beth</b></font>)</div>answered Beth, adding, as
she (<font color='blue'><b>Beth</b></font>) slipped out of her (<font color='blue'><b>Beth</b></font>) father's arms and went to the instrument, <div class="bookquote">``It's
singing time now, and I want to be in my old place. I'll try to sing
the song of the shepherd boy which the Pilgrims heard. I made the
music for Father, because he (<font color='blue'><b>Father</b></font>) likes the verses.''

 (<font color='red'><b>father</b></font>)</div><p/>So, sitting at the dear little piano, Beth softly touched the keys, and
in the sweet voice they had never thought to hear again, sang to her (<font color='blue'><b>Beth</b></font>)
own accompaniment the quaint hymn, which was a singularly fitting song
for her (<font color='blue'><b>Beth</b></font>).


<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) that is down need fear no fall,
He (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) that is low no pride.
He (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) that is humble ever shall
Have God to be his (<font color='blue'><b>God</b></font>) guide.

<p/>I am content with what I have,
Little be it, or much.
And, Lord! Contentment still I crave,
Because Thou savest such.

<p/>Fulness to them a burden is,
That go on pilgrimage.
Here little, and hereafter bliss,
Is best from age to age!



<p/>CHAPTER TWENTY-THREE

<p/>AUNT MARCH SETTLES THE QUESTION

<p/>Like bees swarming after their queen, mother and daughters hovered
about Mr. March the next day, neglecting everything to look at, wait
upon, and listen to the new invalid, who was in a fair way to be killed
by kindness. As he (<font color='blue'><b>Mr.</b></font>) sat propped up in a big chair by Beth's sofa, with
the other three close by, and Hannah popping in her (<font color='blue'><b>Hannah</b></font>) head now and then
`to peek at the dear man', nothing seemed needed to complete their
happiness. But something was needed, and the elder ones felt it,
though none confessed the fact. Mr. and Mrs. March looked at one
another with an anxious expression, as their eyes followed Meg. Jo had
sudden fits of sobriety, and was seen to shake her (<font color='blue'><b>Jo</b></font>) fist at Mr. Brooke's
umbrella, which had been left in the hall. Meg was absent-minded, shy,
and silent, started when the bell rang, and colored when John's name
was mentioned. Amy said, <div class="bookquote">``Everyone seemed waiting for something, and
couldn't settle down, which was queer, since Father was safe at home,''
 (<font color='red'><b>Amy/Amy March</b></font>)</div>and Beth innocently wondered why their neighbors didn't run over as
usual.

<p/>Laurie went by in the afternoon, and seeing Meg at the window, seemed
suddenly possessed with a melodramatic fit, for he (<font color='blue'><b>Laurie</b></font>) fell down on one
knee in the snow, beat his (<font color='blue'><b>Laurie</b></font>) breast, tore his (<font color='blue'><b>Laurie</b></font>) hair, and clasped his (<font color='blue'><b>Laurie</b></font>) hands
imploringly, as if begging some boon. And when Meg told him (<font color='blue'><b>Laurie</b></font>) to behave
himself and go away, he (<font color='blue'><b>Laurie</b></font>) wrung imaginary tears out of his (<font color='blue'><b>Laurie</b></font>) handkerchief,
and staggered round the corner as if in utter despair.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``What does the goose mean?''  (<font color='red'><b>Meg</b></font>)</div>said Meg, laughing and trying to look
unconscious.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``He (<font color='blue'><b>Father</b></font>)'s showing you how your John will go on by-and-by. Touching, isn't
it?''  (<font color='red'><b>Jo/Miss Jo/JO</b></font>)</div>answered Jo scornfully.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Don't say my John, it isn't proper or true,''  (<font color='red'><b>Meg</b></font>)</div>but Meg's voice lingered
over the words as if they sounded pleasant to her (<font color='blue'><b>Meg</b></font>). <div class="bookquote">``Please don't
plague me, Jo, I've told you I don't care much about him (<font color='blue'><b>Father</b></font>), and there
isn't to be anything said, but we are all to be friendly, and go on as
before.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``We can't, for something has been said, and Laurie's mischief has
spoiled you for me. I see it, and so does Mother. You are not like
your old self a bit, and seem ever so far away from me. I don't mean
to plague you and will bear it like a man, but I do wish it was all
settled. I hate to wait, so if you mean ever to do it, make haste and
have it over quickly,''  (<font color='red'><b>Jo/Miss Jo/JO</b></font>)</div>said Jo pettishly.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``I can't say anything till he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) speaks, and he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) won't, because Father said
I was too young,''  (<font color='red'><b>Meg</b></font>)</div>began Meg, bending over her (<font color='blue'><b>Meg</b></font>) work with a queer little
smile, which suggested that she (<font color='blue'><b>Meg</b></font>) did not quite agree with her (<font color='blue'><b>Meg</b></font>) father on
that point.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``If he (<font color='blue'><b>Father</b></font>) did speak, you wouldn't know what to say, but would cry or
blush, or let him (<font color='blue'><b>Father</b></font>) have his (<font color='blue'><b>Father</b></font>) own way, instead of giving a good, decided
no.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I'm not so silly and weak as you think. I know just what I should
say, for I've planned it all, so I needn't be taken unawares. There's
no knowing what may happen, and I wished to be prepared.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Jo/Miss Jo/JO</b></font>)</div><p/>Jo couldn't help smiling at the important air which Meg had
unconsciously assumed and which was as becoming as the pretty color
varying in her (<font color='blue'><b>Meg</b></font>) cheeks.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Would you mind telling me what you'd say?''  (<font color='red'><b>Jo/Miss Jo/JO</b></font>)</div>asked Jo more respectfully.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Not at all. You are sixteen now, quite old enough to be my confidant,
and my experience will be useful to you by-and-by, perhaps, in your own
affairs of this sort.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Don't mean to have any. It's fun to watch other people philander, but
I should feel like a fool doing it myself,''  (<font color='red'><b>Jo/Miss Jo/JO</b></font>)</div>said Jo, looking alarmed at
the thought.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``I think not, if you liked anyone very much, and he (<font color='blue'><b>fool</b></font>) liked you.''  (<font color='red'><b>Meg</b></font>)</div>Meg
spoke as if to herself, and glanced out at the lane where she (<font color='blue'><b>Meg</b></font>) had often
seen lovers walking together in the summer twilight.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``I thought you were going to tell your speech to that man,''  (<font color='red'><b>Jo/Miss Jo/JO</b></font>)</div>said Jo,
rudely shortening her (<font color='blue'><b>Jo</b></font>) sister's little reverie.

<p/>``Oh, I should merely say, quite calmly and decidedly, <div class="bookquote">``Thank you, Mr.
Brooke, you are very kind, but I agree with Father that I am too young
to enter into any engagement at present, so please say no more, but let
us be friends as we were.'''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Hum, that's stiff and cool enough! I don't believe you'll ever say
it, and I know he (<font color='blue'><b>Father</b></font>) won't be satisfied if you do. If he (<font color='blue'><b>Father</b></font>) goes on like the
rejected lovers in books, you'll give in, rather than hurt his (<font color='blue'><b>Father</b></font>)
feelings.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``No, I won't. I shall tell him (<font color='blue'><b>Father</b></font>) I've made up my mind, and shall walk
out of the room with dignity.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Meg</b></font>)</div><p/>Meg rose as she (<font color='blue'><b>Meg</b></font>) spoke, and was just going to rehearse the dignified
exit, when a step in the hall made her (<font color='blue'><b>Meg</b></font>) fly into her (<font color='blue'><b>Meg</b></font>) seat and begin to
sew as fast as if her (<font color='blue'><b>Meg</b></font>) life depended on finishing that particular seam
in a given time. Jo smothered a laugh at the sudden change, and when
someone gave a modest tap, opened the door with a grim aspect which was
anything but hospitable.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Good afternoon. I came to get my umbrella, that is, to see how your
father finds himself today,''  (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Brooke/Brooke</b></font>)</div>said Mr. Brooke, getting a trifle confused
as his (<font color='blue'><b>Brooke</b></font>) eyes went from one telltale face to the other.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``It's very well, he (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>)'s in the rack. I'll get him (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>), and tell it you are
here.''  (<font color='red'><b>father umbrella</b></font>)</div>And having jumbled her (<font color='blue'><b>Jo</b></font>) father and the umbrella well together in
her (<font color='blue'><b>Jo</b></font>) reply, Jo slipped out of the room to give Meg a chance to make her (<font color='blue'><b>Jo</b></font>)
speech and air her (<font color='blue'><b>Jo</b></font>) dignity. But the instant she (<font color='blue'><b>Jo</b></font>) vanished, Meg began to
sidle toward the door, murmuring...

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Mother will like to see you. Pray sit down, I'll call her (<font color='blue'><b>Mother</b></font>).''

 (<font color='red'><b>Meg</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Don't go. Are you afraid of me, Margaret?''  (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Brooke/Brooke</b></font>)</div>and Mr. Brooke looked so
hurt that Meg thought she (<font color='blue'><b>Meg</b></font>) must have done something very rude. She (<font color='blue'><b>Meg</b></font>)
blushed up to the little curls on her (<font color='blue'><b>Meg</b></font>) forehead, for he (<font color='blue'><b>Brooke</b></font>) had never called
her (<font color='blue'><b>Meg</b></font>) Margaret before, and she (<font color='blue'><b>Meg</b></font>) was surprised to find how natural and
sweet it seemed to hear him (<font color='blue'><b>Brooke</b></font>) say it. Anxious to appear friendly and at
her (<font color='blue'><b>Meg</b></font>) ease, she (<font color='blue'><b>Meg</b></font>) put out her (<font color='blue'><b>Meg</b></font>) hand with a confiding gesture, and said
gratefully...

<p/><div class="bookquote">``How can I be afraid when you have been so kind to Father? I only wish
I could thank you for it.''

 (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Shall I tell you how?''  (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Brooke/Brooke</b></font>)</div>asked Mr. Brooke, holding the small hand fast
in both his (<font color='blue'><b>Brooke</b></font>) own, and looking down at Meg with so much love in the brown
eyes that her (<font color='blue'><b>Meg</b></font>) heart began to flutter, and she (<font color='blue'><b>Meg</b></font>) both longed to run away
and to stop and listen.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Oh no, please don't, I'd rather not,''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Meg</b></font>) said, trying to withdraw her (<font color='blue'><b>Meg</b></font>)
hand, and looking frightened in spite of her (<font color='blue'><b>Meg</b></font>) denial.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``I won't trouble you. I only want to know if you care for me a little,
Meg. I love you so much, dear,''  (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Brooke/Brooke</b></font>)</div>added Mr. Brooke tenderly.

<p/>This was the moment for the calm, proper speech, but Meg didn't make
it. She (<font color='blue'><b>Meg</b></font>) forgot every word of it, hung her (<font color='blue'><b>Meg</b></font>) head, and answered, <div class="bookquote">``I don't
know,''  (<font color='red'><b>She</b></font>)</div>so softly that John had to stoop down to catch the foolish
little reply.

<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Brooke</b></font>) seemed to think it was worth the trouble, for he (<font color='blue'><b>Brooke</b></font>) smiled to himself
as if quite satisfied, pressed the plump hand gratefully, and said in
his (<font color='blue'><b>Brooke</b></font>) most persuasive tone, <div class="bookquote">``Will you try and find out? I want to know
so much, for I can't go to work with any heart until I learn whether I
am to have my reward in the end or not.''

 (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I'm too young,''  (<font color='red'><b>Meg</b></font>)</div>faltered Meg, wondering why she (<font color='blue'><b>Meg</b></font>) was so fluttered, yet
rather enjoying it.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``I'll wait, and in the meantime, you could be learning to like me.
Would it be a very hard lesson, dear?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Not if I chose to learn it, but...''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Please choose to learn, Meg. I love to teach, and this is easier than
German,''  (<font color='red'><b>John/Mrs. Brooke/John Brooke</b></font>)</div>broke in John, getting possession of the other hand, so that
she (<font color='blue'><b>John</b></font>) had no way of hiding her (<font color='blue'><b>John</b></font>) face as he (<font color='blue'><b>Brooke</b></font>) bent to look into it.

<p/>His (<font color='blue'><b>Brooke</b></font>) tone was properly beseeching, but stealing a shy look at him (<font color='blue'><b>Brooke</b></font>), Meg
saw that his (<font color='blue'><b>Brooke</b></font>) eyes were merry as well as tender, and that he (<font color='blue'><b>Brooke</b></font>) wore the
satisfied smile of one who had no doubt of his (<font color='blue'><b>Brooke</b></font>) success. This nettled
her (<font color='blue'><b>Meg</b></font>). Annie Moffat's foolish lessons in coquetry came into her (<font color='blue'><b>Moffat</b></font>) mind,
and the love of power, which sleeps in the bosoms of the best of little
women, woke up all of a sudden and took possession of her (<font color='blue'><b>Moffat</b></font>). She (<font color='blue'><b>Moffat</b></font>) felt
excited and strange, and not knowing what else to do, followed a
capricious impulse, and, withdrawing her (<font color='blue'><b>Moffat</b></font>) hands, said petulantly, <div class="bookquote">``I
don't choose. Please go away and let me be!''

 (<font color='red'><b>She</b></font>)</div><p/>Poor Mr. Brooke looked as if his (<font color='blue'><b>Brooke</b></font>) lovely castle in the air was tumbling
about his (<font color='blue'><b>Brooke</b></font>) ears, for he (<font color='blue'><b>Brooke</b></font>) had never seen Meg in such a mood before, and it
rather bewildered him (<font color='blue'><b>Brooke</b></font>).

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Do you really mean that?''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Brooke</b></font>) asked anxiously, following her (<font color='blue'><b>Meg</b></font>) as she (<font color='blue'><b>Meg</b></font>)
walked away.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Yes, I do. I don't want to be worried about such things. Father says
I needn't, it's too soon and I'd rather not.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Mayn't I hope you'll change your mind by-and-by? I'll wait and say
nothing till you have had more time. Don't play with me, Meg. I
didn't think that of you.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Don't think of me at all. I'd rather you wouldn't,''  (<font color='red'><b>Meg</b></font>)</div>said Meg, taking
a naughty satisfaction in trying her (<font color='blue'><b>Meg</b></font>) lover's patience and her (<font color='blue'><b>Meg</b></font>) own power.

<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>lover</b></font>) was grave and pale now, and looked decidedly more like the novel
heroes whom she (<font color='blue'><b>Meg</b></font>) admired, but he (<font color='blue'><b>lover</b></font>) neither slapped his (<font color='blue'><b>lover</b></font>) forehead nor
tramped about the room as they did. He (<font color='blue'><b>lover</b></font>) just stood looking at her (<font color='blue'><b>Meg</b></font>) so
wistfully, so tenderly, that she (<font color='blue'><b>Meg</b></font>) found her (<font color='blue'><b>Meg</b></font>) heart relenting in spite of
herself. What would have happened next I cannot say, if Aunt March had
not come hobbling in at this interesting minute.

<p/>The old lady couldn't resist her (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) longing to see her (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) nephew, for she (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) had
met Laurie as she (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) took her (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) airing, and hearing of Mr. March's arrival,
drove straight out to see him (<font color='blue'><b>Mr.</b></font>). The family were all busy in the back
part of the house, and she (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) had made her (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) way quietly in, hoping to
surprise them. She (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) did surprise two of them so much that Meg started
as if she (<font color='blue'><b>Meg</b></font>) had seen a ghost, and Mr. Brooke vanished into the study.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Bless me, what's all this?''  (<font color='red'><b>the lady</b></font>)</div>cried the old lady with a rap of her (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) cane
as she (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) glanced from the pale young gentleman to the scarlet young lady.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``It's Father's friend. I'm so surprised to see you!''  (<font color='red'><b>Meg</b></font>)</div>stammered Meg,
feeling that she (<font color='blue'><b>Meg</b></font>) was in for a lecture now.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``That's evident,''  (<font color='red'><b>Aunt</b></font>)</div>returned Aunt March, sitting down. <div class="bookquote">``But what is
Father's friend saying to make you look like a peony? There's mischief
going on, and I insist upon knowing what it is,''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>with another rap.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``We were only talking. Mr. Brooke came for his (<font color='blue'><b>Brooke</b></font>) umbrella,''  (<font color='red'><b>Meg</b></font>)</div>began Meg,
wishing that Mr. Brooke and the umbrella were safely out of the house.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Brooke? That boy's tutor? Ah! I understand now. I know all about
it. Jo blundered into a wrong message in one of your Father's letters,
and I made her (<font color='blue'><b>Jo</b></font>) tell me. You haven't gone and accepted him (<font color='blue'><b>Father</b></font>), child?''
 (<font color='red'><b>Aunt</b></font>)</div>cried Aunt March, looking scandalized.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Hush! He (<font color='blue'><b>Father</b></font>)'ll hear. Shan't I call Mother?''  (<font color='red'><b>Meg</b></font>)</div>said Meg, much troubled.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Not yet. I've something to say to you, and I must free my mind at
once. Tell me, do you mean to marry this Cook? If you do, not one
penny of my money ever goes to you. Remember that, and be a sensible
girl,''  (<font color='red'><b>the lady</b></font>)</div>said the old lady impressively.

<p/>Now Aunt March possessed in perfection the art of rousing the spirit of
opposition in the gentlest people, and enjoyed doing it. The best of
us have a spice of perversity in us, especially when we are young and
in love. If Aunt March had begged Meg to accept John Brooke, she (<font color='blue'><b>Brooke</b></font>) would
probably have declared she (<font color='blue'><b>Brooke</b></font>) couldn't think of it, but as she (<font color='blue'><b>Brooke</b></font>) was
preemptorily ordered not to like him (<font color='blue'><b>Aunt</b></font>), she (<font color='blue'><b>Brooke</b></font>) immediately made up her (<font color='blue'><b>Brooke</b></font>) mind
that she (<font color='blue'><b>Brooke</b></font>) would. Inclination as well as perversity made the decision
easy, and being already much excited, Meg opposed the old lady with
unusual spirit.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``I shall marry whom I please, Aunt March, and you can leave your money
to anyone you like,''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Meg</b></font>) said, nodding her (<font color='blue'><b>Meg</b></font>) head with a resolute air.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Highty-tighty! Is that the way you take my advice, Miss? You'll be
sorry for it by-and-by, when you've tried love in a cottage and found
it a failure.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``It can't be a worse one than some people find in big houses,''  (<font color='red'><b>Meg</b></font>)</div>retorted
Meg.

<p/>Aunt March put on her (<font color='blue'><b>Meg</b></font>) glasses and took a look at the girl, for she (<font color='blue'><b>Meg</b></font>) did
not know her (<font color='blue'><b>Meg</b></font>) in this new mood. Meg hardly knew herself, she (<font color='blue'><b>Meg</b></font>) felt so
brave and independent, so glad to defend John and assert her (<font color='blue'><b>John</b></font>) right to
love him (<font color='blue'><b>Aunt</b></font>), if she (<font color='blue'><b>John</b></font>) liked. Aunt March saw that she (<font color='blue'><b>Aunt</b></font>) had begun wrong, and
after a little pause, made a fresh start, saying as mildly as she (<font color='blue'><b>Aunt</b></font>)
could, <div class="bookquote">``Now, Meg, my dear, be reasonable and take my advice. I mean it
kindly, and don't want you to spoil your whole life by making a mistake
at the beginning. You ought to marry well and help your family. It's
your duty to make a rich match and it ought to be impressed upon you.''

 (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Father and Mother don't think so. They like John though he (<font color='blue'><b>Father</b></font>) is poor.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Your parents, my dear, have no more worldly wisdom than a pair of
babies.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I'm glad of it,''  (<font color='red'><b>Meg</b></font>)</div>cried Meg stoutly.

<p/>Aunt March took no notice, but went on with her (<font color='blue'><b>Meg</b></font>) lecture. <div class="bookquote">``This Rook is
poor and hasn't got any rich relations, has he (<font color='blue'><b>Father</b></font>)?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``No, but he (<font color='blue'><b>Father</b></font>) has many warm friends.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``You can't live on friends, try it and see how cool they'll grow. He (<font color='blue'><b>Father</b></font>)
hasn't any business, has he (<font color='blue'><b>Father</b></font>)?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Not yet. Mr. Laurence is going to help him (<font color='blue'><b>Laurence</b></font>).''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``That won't last long. James Laurence is a crotchety old fellow and
not to be depended on. So you intend to marry a man without money,
position, or business, and go on working harder than you do now, when
you might be comfortable all your days by minding me and doing better?
I thought you had more sense, Meg.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I couldn't do better if I waited half my life! John is good and wise,
he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>)'s got heaps of talent, he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>)'s willing to work and sure to get on, he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>)'s
so energetic and brave. Everyone likes and respects him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>), and I'm proud
to think he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) cares for me, though I'm so poor and young and silly,''  (<font color='red'><b>Meg</b></font>)</div>said
Meg, looking prettier than ever in her (<font color='blue'><b>Meg</b></font>) earnestness.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``He (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) knows you have got rich relations, child. That's the secret of his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>)
liking, I suspect.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Aunt March, how dare you say such a thing? John is above such
meanness, and I won't listen to you a minute if you talk so,''  (<font color='red'><b>Meg</b></font>)</div>cried Meg
indignantly, forgetting everything but the injustice of the old lady's
suspicions. <div class="bookquote">``My John wouldn't marry for money, any more than I would.
We are willing to work and we mean to wait. I'm not afraid of being
poor, for I've been happy so far, and I know I shall be with him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>)
because he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) loves me, and I...''

 (<font color='red'><b>Meg</b></font>)</div><p/>Meg stopped there, remembering all of a sudden that she (<font color='blue'><b>Meg</b></font>) hadn't made up
her (<font color='blue'><b>Meg</b></font>) mind, that she (<font color='blue'><b>Meg</b></font>) had told `her (<font color='blue'><b>Meg</b></font>) John' to go away, and that he (<font color='blue'><b>Meg</b></font>) might be
overhearing her (<font color='blue'><b>John</b></font>) inconsistent remarks.

<p/>Aunt March was very angry, for she (<font color='blue'><b>Aunt</b></font>) had set her (<font color='blue'><b>Aunt</b></font>) heart on having her (<font color='blue'><b>Aunt</b></font>)
pretty niece make a fine match, and something in the girl's happy young
face made the lonely old woman feel both sad and sour.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Well, I wash my hands of the whole affair! You are a willful child,
and you've lost more than you know by this piece of folly. No, I won't
stop. I'm disappointed in you, and haven't spirits to see your father
now. Don't expect anything from me when you are married. Your Mr.
Brooke's friends must take care of you. I'm done with you forever.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Meg</b></font>)</div><p/>And slamming the door in Meg's face, Aunt March drove off in high
dudgeon. She (<font color='blue'><b>Aunt</b></font>) seemed to take all the girl's courage with her (<font color='blue'><b>Aunt</b></font>), for when
left alone, Meg stood for a moment, undecided whether to laugh or cry.
Before she (<font color='blue'><b>Meg</b></font>) could make up her (<font color='blue'><b>Meg</b></font>) mind, she (<font color='blue'><b>Meg</b></font>) was taken possession of by Mr.
Brooke, who said all in one breath, <div class="bookquote">``I couldn't help hearing, Meg.
Thank you for defending me, and Aunt March for proving that you do care
for me a little bit.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Brooke/Brooke</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I didn't know how much till she (<font color='blue'><b>Aunt</b></font>) abused you,''  (<font color='red'><b>Meg</b></font>)</div>began Meg.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``And I needn't go away, but may stay and be happy, may I, dear?''

 (<font color='red'><b>Meg</b></font>)</div><p/>Here was another fine chance to make the crushing speech and the
stately exit, but Meg never thought of doing either, and disgraced
herself forever in Jo's eyes by meekly whispering, <div class="bookquote">``Yes, John,''  (<font color='red'><b>Jo/Miss Jo/JO</b></font>)</div>and
hiding her (<font color='blue'><b>Meg</b></font>) face on Mr. Brooke's waistcoat.

<p/>Fifteen minutes after Aunt March's departure, Jo came softly
downstairs, paused an instant at the parlor door, and hearing no sound
within, nodded and smiled with a satisfied expression, saying to
herself, <div class="bookquote">``She (<font color='blue'><b>John</b></font>) has seen him (<font color='blue'><b>Brooke</b></font>) away as we planned, and that affair is
settled. I'll go and hear the fun, and have a good laugh over it.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Jo/Miss Jo/JO</b></font>)</div><p/>But poor Jo never got her (<font color='blue'><b>Jo</b></font>) laugh, for she (<font color='blue'><b>Jo</b></font>) was transfixed upon the
threshold by a spectacle which held her (<font color='blue'><b>Jo</b></font>) there, staring with her (<font color='blue'><b>Jo</b></font>) mouth
nearly as wide open as her (<font color='blue'><b>Jo</b></font>) eyes. Going in to exult over a fallen enemy
and to praise a strong-minded sister for the banishment of an
objectionable lover, it certainly was a shock to behold the aforesaid
enemy serenely sitting on the sofa, with the strongminded sister
enthroned upon his (<font color='blue'><b>lover</b></font>) knee and wearing an expression of the most abject
submission. Jo gave a sort of gasp, as if a cold shower bath had
suddenly fallen upon her (<font color='blue'><b>Jo</b></font>), for such an unexpected turning of the tables
actually took her (<font color='blue'><b>Jo</b></font>) breath away. At the odd sound the lovers turned and
saw her (<font color='blue'><b>Jo</b></font>). Meg jumped up, looking both proud and shy, but `that man', as
Jo called him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>), actually laughed and said coolly, as he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) kissed the
astonished newcomer, <div class="bookquote">``Sister Jo, congratulate us!''

 (<font color='red'><b>the newcomer Jo</b></font>)</div><p/>That was adding insult to injury, it was altogether too much, and
making some wild demonstration with her (<font color='blue'><b>Jo</b></font>) hands, Jo vanished without a
word. Rushing upstairs, she (<font color='blue'><b>Jo</b></font>) startled the invalids by exclaiming
tragically as she (<font color='blue'><b>Jo</b></font>) burst into the room, <div class="bookquote">``Oh, do somebody go down quick!
John Brooke is acting dreadfully, and Meg likes it!''

 (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div><p/>Mr. and Mrs. March left the room with speed, and casting herself upon
the bed, Jo cried and scolded tempestuously as she (<font color='blue'><b>Jo</b></font>) told the awful news
to Beth and Amy. The little girls, however, considered it a most
agreeable and interesting event, and Jo got little comfort from them,
so she (<font color='blue'><b>Jo</b></font>) went up to her (<font color='blue'><b>Jo</b></font>) refuge in the garret, and confided her (<font color='blue'><b>Jo</b></font>) troubles
to the rats.

<p/>Nobody ever knew what went on in the parlor that afternoon, but a great
deal of talking was done, and quiet Mr. Brooke astonished his (<font color='blue'><b>Brooke</b></font>) friends
by the eloquence and spirit with which he (<font color='blue'><b>Brooke</b></font>) pleaded his (<font color='blue'><b>Brooke</b></font>) suit, told his (<font color='blue'><b>Brooke</b></font>)
plans, and persuaded them to arrange everything just as he (<font color='blue'><b>Brooke</b></font>) wanted it.

<p/>The tea bell rang before he (<font color='blue'><b>Brooke</b></font>) had finished describing the paradise which
he (<font color='blue'><b>Brooke</b></font>) meant to earn for Meg, and he (<font color='blue'><b>Brooke</b></font>) proudly took her (<font color='blue'><b>Meg</b></font>) in to supper, both
looking so happy that Jo hadn't the heart to be jealous or dismal. Amy
was very much impressed by John's devotion and Meg's dignity, Beth
beamed at them from a distance, while Mr. and Mrs. March surveyed the
young couple with such tender satisfaction that it was perfectly
evident Aunt March was right in calling them as `unworldly as a pair of
babies'. No one ate much, but everyone looked very happy, and the old
room seemed to brighten up amazingly when the first romance of the
family began there.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``You can't say nothing pleasant ever happens now, can you, Meg?''  (<font color='red'><b>Amy/Amy March</b></font>)</div>said
Amy, trying to decide how she (<font color='blue'><b>Amy</b></font>) would group the lovers in a sketch she (<font color='blue'><b>Amy</b></font>)
was planning to make.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``No, I'm sure I can't. How much has happened since I said that! It
seems a year ago,''  (<font color='red'><b>Meg</b></font>)</div>answered Meg, who was in a blissful dream lifted far
above such common things as bread and butter.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``The joys come close upon the sorrows this time, and I rather think the
changes have begun,''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>said Mrs. March. <div class="bookquote">``In most families there comes,
now and then, a year full of events. This has been such a one, but it
ends well, after all.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Hope the next will end better,''  (<font color='red'><b>Jo/Miss Jo/JO</b></font>)</div>muttered Jo, who found it very hard to
see Meg absorbed in a stranger before her (<font color='blue'><b>Meg</b></font>) face, for Jo loved a few
persons very dearly and dreaded to have their affection lost or
lessened in any way.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``I hope the third year from this will end better. I mean it shall, if
I live to work out my plans,''  (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Brooke/Brooke</b></font>)</div>said Mr. Brooke, smiling at Meg, as if
everything had become possible to him (<font color='blue'><b>Brooke</b></font>) now.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Doesn't it seem very long to wait?''  (<font color='red'><b>Amy/Amy March</b></font>)</div>asked Amy, who was in a hurry for
the wedding.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``I've got so much to learn before I shall be ready, it seems a short
time to me,''  (<font color='red'><b>Meg</b></font>)</div>answered Meg, with a sweet gravity in her (<font color='blue'><b>Meg</b></font>) face never seen
there before.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``You have only to wait, I am to do the work,''  (<font color='red'><b>John/Mrs. Brooke/John Brooke</b></font>)</div>said John beginning his (<font color='blue'><b>Brooke</b></font>)
labors by picking up Meg's napkin, with an expression which caused Jo
to shake her (<font color='blue'><b>Jo</b></font>) head, and then say to herself with an air of relief as the
front door banged, <div class="bookquote">``Here comes Laurie. Now we shall have some sensible
conversation.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Jo/Miss Jo/JO</b></font>)</div><p/>But Jo was mistaken, for Laurie came prancing in, overflowing with good
spirits, bearing a great bridal-looking bouquet for ``Mrs. John Brooke',
and evidently laboring under the delusion that the whole affair had
been brought about by his (<font color='blue'><b>Laurie</b></font>) excellent management.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``I knew Brooke would have it all his (<font color='blue'><b>Brooke</b></font>) own way, he (<font color='blue'><b>Brooke</b></font>) always does, for when
he (<font color='blue'><b>Brooke</b></font>) makes up his (<font color='blue'><b>Brooke</b></font>) mind to accomplish anything, it's done though the sky
falls,''  (<font color='red'><b>Laurie/Mr. Laurie/LAURIE</b></font>)</div>said Laurie, when he (<font color='blue'><b>Laurie</b></font>) had presented his (<font color='blue'><b>Laurie</b></font>) offering and his (<font color='blue'><b>Laurie</b></font>)
congratulations.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Much obliged for that recommendation. I take it as a good omen for
the future and invite you to my wedding on the spot,''  (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Brooke/Brooke</b></font>)</div>answered Mr.
Brooke, who felt at peace with all mankind, even his (<font color='blue'><b>Brooke</b></font>) mischievous pupil.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``I'll come if I'm at the ends of the earth, for the sight of Jo's face
alone on that occasion would be worth a long journey. You don't look
festive, ma'am, what's the matter?''  (<font color='red'><b>Laurie/Mr. Laurie/LAURIE</b></font>)</div>asked Laurie, following her (<font color='blue'><b>Jo</b></font>) into a
corner of the parlor, whither all had adjourned to greet Mr. Laurence.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``I don't approve of the match, but I've made up my mind to bear it, and
shall not say a word against it,''  (<font color='red'><b>Jo/Miss Jo/JO</b></font>)</div>said Jo solemnly. <div class="bookquote">``You can't know
how hard it is for me to give up Meg,''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Jo</b></font>) continued with a little
quiver in her (<font color='blue'><b>Jo</b></font>) voice.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``You don't give her (<font color='blue'><b>Meg</b></font>) up. You only go halves,''  (<font color='red'><b>Laurie/Mr. Laurie/LAURIE</b></font>)</div>said Laurie consolingly.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``It can never be the same again. I've lost my dearest friend,''  (<font color='red'><b>Jo/Miss Jo/JO</b></font>)</div>sighed
Jo.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``You've got me, anyhow. I'm not good for much, I know, but I'll stand
by you, Jo, all the days of my life. Upon my word I will!''  (<font color='red'><b>Laurie/Mr. Laurie/LAURIE</b></font>)</div>and Laurie
meant what he (<font color='blue'><b>Laurie</b></font>) said.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``I know you will, and I'm ever so much obliged. You are always a great
comfort to me, Teddy,''  (<font color='red'><b>Jo/Miss Jo/JO</b></font>)</div>returned Jo, gratefully shaking hands.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Well, now, don't be dismal, there's a good fellow. It's all right you
see. Meg is happy, Brooke will fly round and get settled immediately,
Grandpa will attend to him (<font color='blue'><b>Brooke</b></font>), and it will be very jolly to see Meg in her (<font color='blue'><b>Meg</b></font>)
own little house. We'll have capital times after she (<font color='blue'><b>Meg</b></font>) is gone, for I
shall be through college before long, and then we'll go abroad on some
nice trip or other. Wouldn't that console you?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I rather think it would, but there's no knowing what may happen in
three years,''  (<font color='red'><b>Jo/Miss Jo/JO</b></font>)</div>said Jo thoughtfully.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``That's true. Don't you wish you could take a look forward and see
where we shall all be then? I do,''  (<font color='red'><b>Laurie/Mr. Laurie/LAURIE</b></font>)</div>returned Laurie.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``I think not, for I might see something sad, and everyone looks so
happy now, I don't believe they could be much improved.''  (<font color='red'><b>Jo/Miss Jo/JO</b></font>)</div>And Jo's eyes
went slowly round the room, brightening as they looked, for the
prospect was a pleasant one.

<p/>Father and Mother sat together, quietly reliving the first chapter of
the romance which for them began some twenty years ago. Amy was drawing
the lovers, who sat apart in a beautiful world of their own, the light
of which touched their faces with a grace the little artist could not
copy. Beth lay on her (<font color='blue'><b>Beth</b></font>) sofa, talking cheerily with her (<font color='blue'><b>Beth</b></font>) old friend, who
held her (<font color='blue'><b>Beth</b></font>) little hand as if he (<font color='blue'><b>friend</b></font>) felt that it possessed the power to lead
him (<font color='blue'><b>friend</b></font>) along the peaceful way she (<font color='blue'><b>Beth</b></font>) walked. Jo lounged in her (<font color='blue'><b>Jo</b></font>) favorite low
seat, with the grave quiet look which best became her (<font color='blue'><b>Jo</b></font>), and Laurie,
leaning on the back of her (<font color='blue'><b>Jo</b></font>) chair, his (<font color='blue'><b>Laurie</b></font>) chin on a level with her (<font color='blue'><b>Jo</b></font>) curly
head, smiled with his (<font color='blue'><b>Laurie</b></font>) friendliest aspect, and nodded at her (<font color='blue'><b>Jo</b></font>) in the long
glass which reflected them both.


<p/>So the curtain falls upon Meg, Jo, Beth, and Amy. Whether it ever
rises again, depends upon the reception given the first act of the
domestic drama called _Little Women_.







<p/>LITTLE WOMEN PART 2

<p/>In order that we may start afresh and go to Meg's wedding...



<p/>CHAPTER TWENTY-FOUR

<p/>GOSSIP

<p/>In order that we may start afresh and go to Meg's wedding with free
minds, it will be well to begin with a little gossip about the Marches.
And here let me premise that if any of the elders think there is too
much `lovering' in the story, as I fear they may -LRB-I'm not afraid the
young folks will make that objection-RRB-, I can only say with Mrs. March,
<div class="bookquote">``What can you expect when I have four gay girls in the house, and a
dashing young neighbor over the way?''

 (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div><p/>The three years that have passed have brought but few changes to the
quiet family. The war is over, and Mr. March safely at home, busy with
his (<font color='blue'><b>Mr.</b></font>) books and the small parish which found in him (<font color='blue'><b>Mr.</b></font>) a minister by nature
as by grace, a quiet, studious man, rich in the wisdom that is better
than learning, the charity which calls all mankind `brother', the piety
that blossoms into character, making it august and lovely.

<p/>These attributes, in spite of poverty and the strict integrity which
shut him (<font color='blue'><b>character</b></font>) out from the more worldly successes, attracted to him (<font color='blue'><b>character</b></font>) many
admirable persons, as naturally as sweet herbs draw bees, and as
naturally he (<font color='blue'><b>character</b></font>) gave them the honey into which fifty years of hard
experience had distilled no bitter drop. Earnest young men found the
gray-headed scholar as young at heart as they; thoughtful or troubled
women instinctively brought their doubts to him (<font color='blue'><b>scholar</b></font>), sure of finding the
gentlest sympathy, the wisest counsel. Sinners told their sins to the
pure-hearted old man and were both rebuked and saved. Gifted men found
a companion in him (<font color='blue'><b>companion</b></font>). Ambitious men caught glimpses of nobler ambitions
than their own, and even worldlings confessed that his (<font color='blue'><b>companion</b></font>) beliefs were
beautiful and true, although `they wouldn't pay'.

<p/>To outsiders the five energetic women seemed to rule the house, and so
they did in many things, but the quiet scholar, sitting among his (<font color='blue'><b>scholar</b></font>)
books, was still the head of the family, the household conscience,
anchor, and comforter, for to him (<font color='blue'><b>scholar</b></font>) the busy, anxious women always turned
in troublous times, finding him (<font color='blue'><b>scholar</b></font>), in the truest sense of those sacred
words, husband and father.

<p/>The girls gave their hearts into their mother's keeping, their souls
into their father's, and to both parents, who lived and labored so
faithfully for them, they gave a love that grew with their growth and
bound them tenderly together by the sweetest tie which blesses life and
outlives death.

<p/>Mrs. March is as brisk and cheery, though rather grayer, than when we
saw her (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) last, and just now so absorbed in Meg's affairs that the
hospitals and homes still full of wounded `boys' and soldiers' widows,
decidedly miss the motherly missionary's visits.

<p/>John Brooke did his (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) duty manfully for a year, got wounded, was sent
home, and not allowed to return. He (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) received no stars or bars, but he (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>)
deserved them, for he (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) cheerfully risked all he (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) had, and life and love
are very precious when both are in full bloom. Perfectly resigned to
his (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) discharge, he (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) devoted himself to getting well, preparing for
business, and earning a home for Meg. With the good sense and sturdy
independence that characterized him (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>), he (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) refused Mr. Laurence's more
generous offers, and accepted the place of bookkeeper, feeling better
satisfied to begin with an honestly earned salary than by running any
risks with borrowed money.

<p/>Meg had spent the time in working as well as waiting, growing womanly
in character, wise in housewifely arts, and prettier than ever, for
love is a great beautifier. She (<font color='blue'><b>Meg</b></font>) had her (<font color='blue'><b>Meg</b></font>) girlish ambitions and hopes,
and felt some disappointment at the humble way in which the new life
must begin. Ned Moffat had just married Sallie Gardiner, and Meg
couldn't help contrasting their fine house and carriage, many gifts,
and splendid outfit with her (<font color='blue'><b>Meg</b></font>) own, and secretly wishing she (<font color='blue'><b>Meg</b></font>) could have
the same. But somehow envy and discontent soon vanished when she (<font color='blue'><b>Meg</b></font>)
thought of all the patient love and labor John had put into the little
home awaiting her (<font color='blue'><b>John</b></font>), and when they sat together in the twilight, talking
over their small plans, the future always grew so beautiful and bright
that she (<font color='blue'><b>John</b></font>) forgot Sallie's splendor and felt herself the richest,
happiest girl in Christendom.

<p/>Jo never went back to Aunt March, for the old lady took such a fancy to
Amy that she (<font color='blue'><b>Amy</b></font>) bribed her (<font color='blue'><b>Amy</b></font>) with the offer of drawing lessons from one of
the best teachers going, and for the sake of this advantage, Amy would
have served a far harder mistress. So she (<font color='blue'><b>Amy</b></font>) gave her (<font color='blue'><b>Amy</b></font>) mornings to duty,
her (<font color='blue'><b>Amy</b></font>) afternoons to pleasure, and prospered finely. Jo meantime devoted
herself to literature and Beth, who remained delicate long after the
fever was a thing of the past. Not an invalid exactly, but never again
the rosy, healthy creature she (<font color='blue'><b>Beth</b></font>) had been, yet always hopeful, happy, and
serene, and busy with the quiet duties she (<font color='blue'><b>Beth</b></font>) loved, everyone's friend,
and an angel in the house, long before those who loved her (<font color='blue'><b>Beth</b></font>) most had
learned to know it.

<p/>As long as _The Spread Eagle_ paid her (<font color='blue'><b>Beth</b></font>) a dollar a column for her (<font color='blue'><b>Beth</b></font>)
`rubbish', as she (<font color='blue'><b>Beth</b></font>) called it, Jo felt herself a woman of means, and spun
her (<font color='blue'><b>Jo</b></font>) little romances diligently. But great plans fermented in her (<font color='blue'><b>Jo</b></font>) busy
brain and ambitious mind, and the old tin kitchen in the garret held a
slowly increasing pile of blotted manuscript, which was one day to
place the name of March upon the roll of fame.

<p/>Laurie, having dutifully gone to college to please his (<font color='blue'><b>Laurie</b></font>) grandfather, was
now getting through it in the easiest possible manner to please
himself. A universal favorite, thanks to money, manners, much talent,
and the kindest heart that ever got its owner into scrapes by trying to
get other people out of them, he (<font color='blue'><b>owner</b></font>) stood in great danger of being
spoiled, and probably would have been, like many another promising boy,
if he (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>) had not possessed a talisman against evil in the memory of the
kind old man who was bound up in his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) success, the motherly friend who
watched over him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) as if he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) were her (<font color='blue'><b>it</b></font>) son, and last, but not least by any
means, the knowledge that four innocent girls loved, admired, and
believed in him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) with all their hearts.

<p/>Being only 'a glorious human boy', of course he (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>) frolicked and flirted,
grew dandified, aquatic, sentimental, or gymnastic, as college fashions
ordained, hazed and was hazed, talked slang, and more than once came
perilously near suspension and expulsion. But as high spirits and the
love of fun were the causes of these pranks, he (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>) always managed to save
himself by frank confession, honorable atonement, or the irresistible
power of persuasion which he (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>) possessed in perfection. In fact, he (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>)
rather prided himself on his (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>) narrow escapes, and liked to thrill the
girls with graphic accounts of his (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>) triumphs over wrathful tutors,
dignified professors, and vanquished enemies. The `men of my class',
were heroes in the eyes of the girls, who never wearied of the exploits
of `our fellows', and were frequently allowed to bask in the smiles of
these great creatures, when Laurie brought them home with him (<font color='blue'><b>Laurie</b></font>).

<p/>Amy especially enjoyed this high honor, and became quite a belle among
them, for her (<font color='blue'><b>Amy</b></font>) ladyship early felt and learned to use the gift of
fascination with which she (<font color='blue'><b>Amy</b></font>) was endowed. Meg was too much absorbed in
her (<font color='blue'><b>Meg</b></font>) private and particular John to care for any other lords of
creation, and Beth too shy to do more than peep at them and wonder how
Amy dared to order them about so, but Jo felt quite in her (<font color='blue'><b>Jo</b></font>) own element,
and found it very difficult to refrain from imitating the gentlemanly
attitudes, phrases, and feats, which seemed more natural to her (<font color='blue'><b>Jo</b></font>) than
the decorums prescribed for young ladies. They all liked Jo immensely,
but never fell in love with her (<font color='blue'><b>Jo</b></font>), though very few escaped without paying
the tribute of a sentimental sigh or two at Amy's shrine. And speaking
of sentiment brings us very naturally to the ``Dovecote'.

<p/>That was the name of the little brown house Mr. Brooke had prepared for
Meg's first home. Laurie had christened it, saying it was highly
appropriate to the gentle lovers who `went on together like a pair of
turtledoves, with first a bill and then a coo'. It was a tiny house,
with a little garden behind and a lawn about as big as a pocket
handkerchief in the front. Here Meg meant to have a fountain,
shrubbery, and a profusion of lovely flowers, though just at present
the fountain was represented by a weather-beaten urn, very like a
dilapidated slopbowl, the shrubbery consisted of several young larches,
undecided whether to live or die, and the profusion of flowers was
merely hinted by regiments of sticks to show where seeds were planted.
But inside, it was altogether charming, and the happy bride saw no
fault from garret to cellar. To be sure, the hall was so narrow it was
fortunate that they had no piano, for one never could have been got in
whole, the dining room was so small that six people were a tight fit,
and the kitchen stairs seemed built for the express purpose of
precipitating both servants and china pell-mell into the coalbin. But
once get used to these slight blemishes and nothing could be more
complete, for good sense and good taste had presided over the
furnishing, and the result was highly satisfactory. There were no
marble-topped tables, long mirrors, or lace curtains in the little
parlor, but simple furniture, plenty of books, a fine picture or two, a
stand of flowers in the bay window, and, scattered all about, the
pretty gifts which came from friendly hands and were the fairer for the
loving messages they brought.

<p/>I don't think the Parian Psyche Laurie gave lost any of its beauty
because John put up the bracket it stood upon, that any upholsterer
could have draped the plain muslin curtains more gracefully than Amy's
artistic hand, or that any store-room was ever better provided with
good wishes, merry words, and happy hopes than that in which Jo and her (<font color='blue'><b>Jo</b></font>)
mother put away Meg's few boxes, barrels, and bundles, and I am morally
certain that the spandy new kitchen never could have looked so cozy and
neat if Hannah had not arranged every pot and pan a dozen times over,
and laid the fire all ready for lighting the minute ``Mis. Brooke came
home'. I also doubt if any young matron ever began life with so rich a
supply of dusters, holders, and piece bags, for Beth made enough to
last till the silver wedding came round, and invented three different
kinds of dishcloths for the express service of the bridal china.

<p/>People who hire all these things done for them never know what they
lose, for the homeliest tasks get beautified if loving hands do them,
and Meg found so many proofs of this that everything in her (<font color='blue'><b>Meg</b></font>) small nest,
from the kitchen roller to the silver vase on her (<font color='blue'><b>Meg</b></font>) parlor table, was
eloquent of home love and tender forethought.

<p/>What happy times they had planning together, what solemn shopping
excursions, what funny mistakes they made, and what shouts of laughter
arose over Laurie's ridiculous bargains. In his (<font color='blue'><b>Laurie</b></font>) love of jokes, this
young gentleman, though nearly through college, was a much of a boy as
ever. His (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>) last whim had been to bring with him (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>) on his (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>) weekly visits
some new, useful, and ingenious article for the young housekeeper. Now
a bag of remarkable clothespins, next, a wonderful nutmeg grater which
fell to pieces at the first trial, a knife cleaner that spoiled all the
knives, or a sweeper that picked the nap neatly off the carpet and left
the dirt, labor-saving soap that took the skin off one's hands,
infallible cements which stuck firmly to nothing but the fingers of the
deluded buyer, and every kind of tinware, from a toy savings bank for
odd pennies, to a wonderful boiler which would wash articles in its own
steam with every prospect of exploding in the process.

<p/>In vain Meg begged him (<font color='blue'><b>sweeper</b></font>) to stop. John laughed at him (<font color='blue'><b>sweeper</b></font>), and Jo called him (<font color='blue'><b>sweeper</b></font>)
``Mr. Toodles'. He (<font color='blue'><b>sweeper</b></font>) was possessed with a mania for patronizing Yankee
ingenuity, and seeing his (<font color='blue'><b>sweeper</b></font>) friends fitly furnished forth. So each week
beheld some fresh absurdity.

<p/>Everything was done at last, even to Amy's arranging different colored
soaps to match the different colored rooms, and Beth's setting the
table for the first meal.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Are you satisfied? Does it seem like home, and do you feel as if you
should be happy here?''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>asked Mrs. March, as she (<font color='blue'><b>Amy</b></font>) and her (<font color='blue'><b>Amy</b></font>) daughter went
through the new kingdom arm in arm, for just then they seemed to cling
together more tenderly than ever.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Yes, Mother, perfectly satisfied, thanks to you all, and so happy that
I can't talk about it,''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>with a look that was far better than words.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``If she (<font color='blue'><b>Mother</b></font>) only had a servant or two it would be all right,''  (<font color='red'><b>Amy/Amy March</b></font>)</div>said Amy,
coming out of the parlor, where she (<font color='blue'><b>Amy</b></font>) had been trying to decide whether
the bronze Mercury looked best on the whatnot or the mantlepiece.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Mother and I have talked that over, and I have made up my mind to try
her (<font color='blue'><b>Mother</b></font>) way first. There will be so little to do that with Lotty to run my
errands and help me here and there, I shall only have enough work to
keep me from getting lazy or homesick,''  (<font color='red'><b>Meg</b></font>)</div>answered Meg tranquilly.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Sallie Moffat has four,''  (<font color='red'><b>Amy/Amy March</b></font>)</div>began Amy.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``If Meg had four, the house wouldn't hold them, and master and missis
would have to camp in the garden,''  (<font color='red'><b>Jo/Miss Jo/JO</b></font>)</div>broke in Jo, who, enveloped in a big
blue pinafore, was giving the last polish to the door handles.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Sallie isn't a poor man's wife, and many maids are in keeping with her (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>)
fine establishment. Meg and John begin humbly, but I have a feeling
that there will be quite as much happiness in the little house as in
the big one. It's a great mistake for young girls like Meg to leave
themselves nothing to do but dress, give orders, and gossip. When I
was first married, I used to long for my new clothes to wear out or get
torn, so that I might have the pleasure of mending them, for I got
heartily sick of doing fancywork and tending my pocket handkerchief.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Why didn't you go into the kitchen and make messes, as Sallie says she (<font color='blue'><b>Sallie</b></font>)
does to amuse herself, though they never turn out well and the servants
laugh at her (<font color='blue'><b>Sallie</b></font>),''  (<font color='red'><b>Meg</b></font>)</div>said Meg.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``I did after a while, not to `mess' but to learn of Hannah how things
should be done, that my servants need not laugh at me. It was play
then, but there came a time when I was truly grateful that I not only
possessed the will but the power to cook wholesome food for my little
girls, and help myself when I could no longer afford to hire help. You
begin at the other end, Meg, dear, but the lessons you learn now will
be of use to you by-and-by when John is a richer man, for the mistress
of a house, however splendid, should know how work ought to be done, if
she (<font color='blue'><b>John</b></font>) wishes to be well and honestly served.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Yes, Mother, I'm sure of that,''  (<font color='red'><b>Meg</b></font>)</div>said Meg, listening respectfully to
the little lecture, for the best of women will hold forth upon the all
absorbing subject of house keeping. <div class="bookquote">``Do you know I like this room most
of all in my baby house,''  (<font color='red'><b>Meg</b></font>)</div>added Meg, a minute after, as they went
upstairs and she (<font color='blue'><b>Meg</b></font>) looked into her (<font color='blue'><b>Meg</b></font>) well-stored linen closet.

<p/>Beth was there, laying the snowy piles smoothly on the shelves and
exulting over the goodly array. All three laughed as Meg spoke, for
that linen closet was a joke. You see, having said that if Meg married
`that Brooke' she (<font color='blue'><b>Meg</b></font>) shouldn't have a cent of her (<font color='blue'><b>Meg</b></font>) money, Aunt March was
rather in a quandary when time had appeased her (<font color='blue'><b>Meg</b></font>) wrath and made her (<font color='blue'><b>Meg</b></font>)
repent her (<font color='blue'><b>Meg</b></font>) vow. She (<font color='blue'><b>Meg</b></font>) never broke her (<font color='blue'><b>Meg</b></font>) word, and was much exercised in
her (<font color='blue'><b>Meg</b></font>) mind how to get round it, and at last devised a plan whereby she (<font color='blue'><b>Meg</b></font>)
could satisfy herself. Mrs. Carrol, Florence's mamma, was ordered to
buy, have made, and marked a generous supply of house and table linen,
and send it as her (<font color='blue'><b>Carrol</b></font>) present, all of which was faithfully done, but the
secret leaked out, and was greatly enjoyed by the family, for Aunt
March tried to look utterly unconscious, and insisted that she (<font color='blue'><b>Aunt</b></font>) could
give nothing but the old-fashioned pearls long promised to the first
bride.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``That's a housewifely taste which I am glad to see. I had a young
friend who set up housekeeping with six sheets, but she (<font color='blue'><b>Mother</b></font>) had finger
bowls for company and that satisfied her (<font color='blue'><b>Mother</b></font>),''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>said Mrs. March, patting the
damask tablecloths, with a truly feminine appreciation of their
fineness.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``I haven't a single finger bowl, but this is a setout that will last me
all my days, Hannah says.''  (<font color='red'><b>Meg</b></font>)</div>And Meg looked quite contented, as well she (<font color='blue'><b>Meg</b></font>)
might.

<p/>A tall, broad-shouldered young fellow, with a cropped head, a felt
basin of a hat, and a flyaway coat, came tramping down the road at a
great pace, walked over the low fence without stopping to open the
gate, straight up to Mrs. March, with both hands out and a hearty...

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Here I am, Mother! Yes, it's all right.''

 (<font color='red'><b>A fellow basin coat</b></font>)</div><p/>The last words were in answer to the look the elder lady gave him (<font color='blue'><b>fellow</b></font>), a
kindly questioning look which the handsome eyes met so frankly that the
little ceremony closed, as usual, with a motherly kiss.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``For Mrs. John Brooke, with the maker's congratulations and
compliments. Bless you, Beth! What a refreshing spectacle you are,
Jo. Amy, you are getting altogether too handsome for a single lady.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Laurie/Mr. Laurie/LAURIE</b></font>)</div><p/>As Laurie spoke, he (<font color='blue'><b>Laurie</b></font>) delivered a brown paper parcel to Meg, pulled
Beth's hair ribbon, stared at Jo's big pinafore, and fell into an
attitude of mock rapture before Amy, then shook hands all round, and
everyone began to talk.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Where is John?''  (<font color='red'><b>Meg</b></font>)</div>asked Meg anxiously.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Stopped to get the license for tomorrow, ma'am.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Which side won the last match, Teddy?''  (<font color='red'><b>Jo/Miss Jo/JO</b></font>)</div>inquired Jo, who persisted in
feeling an interest in manly sports despite her (<font color='blue'><b>Jo</b></font>) nineteen years.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Ours, of course. Wish you'd been there to see.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``How is the lovely Miss Randal?''  (<font color='red'><b>Amy/Amy March</b></font>)</div>asked Amy with a significant smile.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``More cruel than ever. Don't you see how I'm pining away?''  (<font color='red'><b>Laurie/Mr. Laurie/LAURIE</b></font>)</div>and Laurie
gave his (<font color='blue'><b>Laurie</b></font>) broad chest a sounding slap and heaved a melodramatic sigh.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``What's the last joke? Undo the bundle and see, Meg,''  (<font color='red'><b>Beth</b></font>)</div>said Beth, eying
the knobby parcel with curiosity.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``It's a useful thing to have in the house in case of fire or thieves,''
 (<font color='red'><b>Laurie/Mr. Laurie/LAURIE</b></font>)</div>observed Laurie, as a watchman's rattle appeared, amid the laughter of
the girls.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Any time when John is away and you get frightened, Mrs. Meg, just
swing that out of the front window, and it will rouse the neighborhood
in a jiffy. Nice thing, isn't it?''  (<font color='red'><b>Laurie/Mr. Laurie/LAURIE</b></font>)</div>and Laurie gave them a sample of
its powers that made them cover up their ears.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``There's gratitude for you! And speaking of gratitude reminds me to
mention that you may thank Hannah for saving your wedding cake from
destruction. I saw it going into your house as I came by, and if she (<font color='blue'><b>Hannah</b></font>)
hadn't defended it manfully I'd have had a pick at it, for it looked
like a remarkably plummy one.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I wonder if you will ever grow up, Laurie,''  (<font color='red'><b>Meg</b></font>)</div>said Meg in a matronly
tone.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``I'm doing my best, ma'am, but can't get much higher, I'm afraid, as
six feet is about all men can do in these degenerate days,''  (<font color='red'><b>the gentleman head</b></font>)</div>responded
the young gentleman, whose head was about level with the little
chandelier.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``I suppose it would be profanation to eat anything in this
spick-and-span bower, so as I'm tremendously hungry, I propose an
adjournment,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>gentleman</b></font>) added presently.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Mother and I are going to wait for John. There are some last things
to settle,''  (<font color='red'><b>Meg</b></font>)</div>said Meg, bustling away.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Beth and I are going over to Kitty Bryant's to get more flowers for
tomorrow,''  (<font color='red'><b>Amy/Amy March</b></font>)</div>added Amy, tying a picturesque hat over her (<font color='blue'><b>Meg</b></font>) picturesque
curls, and enjoying the effect as much as anybody.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Come, Jo, don't desert a fellow. I'm in such a state of exhaustion I
can't get home without help. Don't take off your apron, whatever you
do, it's peculiarly becoming,''  (<font color='red'><b>Laurie/Mr. Laurie/LAURIE</b></font>)</div>said Laurie, as Jo bestowed his (<font color='blue'><b>Laurie</b></font>) especial
aversion in her (<font color='blue'><b>Jo</b></font>) capacious pocket and offered her (<font color='blue'><b>Jo</b></font>) arm to support his (<font color='blue'><b>Laurie</b></font>)
feeble steps.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Now, Teddy, I want to talk seriously to you about tomorrow,''  (<font color='red'><b>Jo/Miss Jo/JO</b></font>)</div>began Jo,
as they strolled away together. <div class="bookquote">``You must promise to behave well, and
not cut up any pranks, and spoil our plans.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Not a prank.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``And don't say funny things when we ought to be sober.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I never do. You are the one for that.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``And I implore you not to look at me during the ceremony. I shall
certainly laugh if you do.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``You won't see me, you'll be crying so hard that the thick fog round
you will obscure the prospect.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I never cry unless for some great affliction.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Such as fellows going to college, hey?''  (<font color='red'><b>Laurie/Mr. Laurie/LAURIE</b></font>)</div>cut in Laurie, with suggestive
laugh.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Don't be a peacock. I only moaned a trifle to keep the girls company.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Exactly. I say, Jo, how is Grandpa this week? Pretty amiable?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Very. Why, have you got into a scrape and want to know how he (<font color='blue'><b>Grandpa</b></font>)'ll take
it?''  (<font color='red'><b>Jo/Miss Jo/JO</b></font>)</div>asked Jo rather sharply.

<p/>``Now, Jo, do you think I'd look your mother in the face and say <div class="bookquote">``All
right', if it wasn't?''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>and Laurie stopped short, with an injured air.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``No, I don't.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Then don't go and be suspicious. I only want some money,''  (<font color='red'><b>Laurie/Mr. Laurie/LAURIE</b></font>)</div>said
Laurie, walking on again, appeased by her (<font color='blue'><b>Jo</b></font>) hearty tone.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``You spend a great deal, Teddy.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Bless you, I don't spend it, it spends itself somehow, and is gone
before I know it.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/>``You are so generous and kind-hearted that you let people borrow, and
can't say <div class="bookquote">``No' to anyone. We heard about Henshaw and all you did for
him (<font color='blue'><b>Henshaw</b></font>). If you always spent money in that way, no one would blame you,''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>said Jo warmly.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Oh, he (<font color='blue'><b>Henshaw</b></font>) made a mountain out of a molehill. You wouldn't have me let
that fine fellow work himself to death just for want of a little help,
when he (<font color='blue'><b>fellow</b></font>) is worth a dozen of us lazy chaps, would you?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Of course not, but I don't see the use of your having seventeen
waistcoats, endless neckties, and a new hat every time you come home. I
thought you'd got over the dandy period, but every now and then it
breaks out in a new spot. Just now it's the fashion to be hideous, to
make your head look like a scrubbing brush, wear a strait jacket,
orange gloves, and clumping square-toed boots. If it was cheap
ugliness, I'd say nothing, but it costs as much as the other, and I
don't get any satisfaction out of it.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Laurie/Mr. Laurie/LAURIE</b></font>)</div><p/>Laurie threw back his (<font color='blue'><b>Laurie</b></font>) head, and laughed so heartily at this attack,
that the felt hat fell off, and Jo walked on it, which insult only
afforded him (<font color='blue'><b>Laurie</b></font>) an opportunity for expatiating on the advantages of a
rough-and-ready costume, as he (<font color='blue'><b>Laurie</b></font>) folded up the maltreated hat, and
stuffed it into his (<font color='blue'><b>Laurie</b></font>) pocket.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Don't lecture any more, there's a good soul! I have enough all
through the week, and like to enjoy myself when I come home. I'll get
myself up regardless of expense tomorrow and be a satisfaction to my
friends.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I'll leave you in peace if you'll only let your hair grow. I'm not
aristocratic, but I do object to being seen with a person who looks
like a young prize fighter,''  (<font color='red'><b>Jo/Miss Jo/JO</b></font>)</div>observed Jo severely.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``This unassuming style promotes study, that's why we adopt it,''
 (<font color='red'><b>Laurie/Mr. Laurie/LAURIE</b></font>)</div>returned Laurie, who certainly could not be accused of vanity, having
voluntarily sacrificed a handsome curly crop to the demand for
quarter-inch-long stubble.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``By the way, Jo, I think that little Parker is really getting desperate
about Amy. He (<font color='blue'><b>Parker</b></font>) talks of her (<font color='blue'><b>Amy</b></font>) constantly, writes poetry, and moons about
in a most suspicious manner. He (<font color='blue'><b>Parker</b></font>)'d better nip his (<font color='blue'><b>Parker</b></font>) little passion in the
bud, hadn't he (<font color='blue'><b>Parker</b></font>)?''  (<font color='red'><b>Laurie/Mr. Laurie/LAURIE</b></font>)</div>added Laurie, in a confidential, elder brotherly tone,
after a minute's silence.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Of course he (<font color='blue'><b>Parker</b></font>) had. We don't want any more marrying in this family for
years to come. Mercy on us, what are the children thinking of?''  (<font color='red'><b>Jo/Miss Jo/JO</b></font>)</div>and Jo
looked as much scandalized as if Amy and little Parker were not yet in
their teens.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``It's a fast age, and I don't know what we are coming to, ma'am. You
are a mere infant, but you'll go next, Jo, and we'll be left
lamenting,''  (<font color='red'><b>Laurie/Mr. Laurie/LAURIE</b></font>)</div>said Laurie, shaking his (<font color='blue'><b>Laurie</b></font>) head over the degeneracy of the
times.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Don't be alarmed. I'm not one of the agreeable sort. Nobody will
want me, and it's a mercy, for there should always be one old maid in a
family.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``You won't give anyone a chance,''  (<font color='red'><b>Laurie/Mr. Laurie/LAURIE</b></font>)</div>said Laurie, with a sidelong glance
and a little more color than before in his (<font color='blue'><b>Laurie</b></font>) sunburned face. <div class="bookquote">``You won't
show the soft side of your character, and if a fellow gets a peep at it
by accident and can't help showing that he (<font color='blue'><b>fellow</b></font>) likes it, you treat him (<font color='blue'><b>fellow</b></font>) as
Mrs. Gummidge did her (<font color='blue'><b>Gummidge</b></font>) sweetheart, throw cold water over him (<font color='blue'><b>fellow</b></font>), and get so
thorny no one dares touch or look at you.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I don't like that sort of thing. I'm too busy to be worried with
nonsense, and I think it's dreadful to break up families so. Now don't
say any more about it. Meg's wedding has turned all our heads, and we
talk of nothing but lovers and such absurdities. I don't wish to get
cross, so let's change the subject;''  (<font color='red'><b>Jo/Miss Jo/JO</b></font>)</div>and Jo looked quite ready to
fling cold water on the slightest provocation.

<p/>Whatever his (<font color='blue'><b>Laurie</b></font>) feelings might have been, Laurie found a vent for them in
a long low whistle and the fearful prediction as they parted at the
gate, <div class="bookquote">``Mark my words, Jo, you'll go next.''



 (<font color='red'><b>Laurie/Mr. Laurie/LAURIE</b></font>)</div><p/>CHAPTER TWENTY-FIVE

<p/>THE FIRST WEDDING

<p/>The June roses over the porch were awake bright and early on that
morning, rejoicing with all their hearts in the cloudless sunshine,
like friendly little neighbors, as they were. Quite flushed with
excitement were their ruddy faces, as they swung in the wind,
whispering to one another what they had seen, for some peeped in at the
dining room windows where the feast was spread, some climbed up to nod
and smile at the sisters as they dressed the bride, others waved a
welcome to those who came and went on various errands in garden, porch,
and hall, and all, from the rosiest full-blown flower to the palest
baby bud, offered their tribute of beauty and fragrance to the gentle
mistress who had loved and tended them so long.

<p/>Meg looked very like a rose herself, for all that was best and sweetest
in heart and soul seemed to bloom into her (<font color='blue'><b>Meg</b></font>) face that day, making it
fair and tender, with a charm more beautiful than beauty. Neither silk,
lace, nor orange flowers would she (<font color='blue'><b>Meg</b></font>) have. <div class="bookquote">``I don't want a fashionable
wedding, but only those about me whom I love, and to them I wish to
look and be my familiar self.''

 (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div><p/>So she (<font color='blue'><b>Meg</b></font>) made her (<font color='blue'><b>Meg</b></font>) wedding gown herself, sewing into it the tender hopes
and innocent romances of a girlish heart. Her (<font color='blue'><b>Meg</b></font>) sisters braided up her (<font color='blue'><b>Meg</b></font>)
pretty hair, and the only ornaments she (<font color='blue'><b>Meg</b></font>) wore were the lilies of the
valley, which `her (<font color='blue'><b>Meg</b></font>) John' liked best of all the flowers that grew.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``You do look just like our own dear Meg, only so very sweet and lovely
that I should hug you if it wouldn't crumple your dress,''  (<font color='red'><b>Amy/Amy March</b></font>)</div>cried Amy,
surveying her (<font color='blue'><b>Amy</b></font>) with delight when all was done.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Then I am satisfied. But please hug and kiss me, everyone, and don't
mind my dress. I want a great many crumples of this sort put into it
today,''  (<font color='red'><b>Meg</b></font>)</div>and Meg opened her (<font color='blue'><b>Meg</b></font>) arms to her (<font color='blue'><b>Meg</b></font>) sisters, who clung about her (<font color='blue'><b>Meg</b></font>)
with April faces for a minute, feeling that the new love had not
changed the old.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Now I'm going to tie John's cravat for him (<font color='blue'><b>I</b></font>), and then to stay a few
minutes with Father quietly in the study,''  (<font color='red'><b>Meg</b></font>)</div>and Meg ran down to perform
these little ceremonies, and then to follow her (<font color='blue'><b>Meg</b></font>) mother wherever she (<font color='blue'><b>Meg</b></font>)
went, conscious that in spite of the smiles on the motherly face, there
was a secret sorrow hid in the motherly heart at the flight of the
first bird from the nest.

<p/>As the younger girls stand together, giving the last touches to their
simple toilet, it may be a good time to tell of a few changes which
three years have wrought in their appearance, for all are looking their
best just now.

<p/>Jo's angles are much softened, she (<font color='blue'><b>Jo</b></font>) has learned to carry herself with
ease, if not grace. The curly crop has lengthened into a thick coil,
more becoming to the small head atop of the tall figure. There is a
fresh color in her (<font color='blue'><b>Jo</b></font>) brown cheeks, a soft shine in her (<font color='blue'><b>Jo</b></font>) eyes, and only
gentle words fall from her (<font color='blue'><b>Jo</b></font>) sharp tongue today.

<p/>Beth has grown slender, pale, and more quiet than ever. The beautiful,
kind eyes are larger, and in them lies an expression that saddens one,
although it is not sad itself. It is the shadow of pain which touches
the young face with such pathetic patience, but Beth seldom complains
and always speaks hopefully of `being better soon'.

<p/>Amy is with truth considered `the flower of the family', for at sixteen
she (<font color='blue'><b>Amy</b></font>) has the air and bearing of a full-grown woman, not beautiful, but
possessed of that indescribable charm called grace. One saw it in the
lines of her (<font color='blue'><b>Amy</b></font>) figure, the make and motion of her (<font color='blue'><b>Amy</b></font>) hands, the flow of her (<font color='blue'><b>Amy</b></font>)
dress, the droop of her (<font color='blue'><b>Amy</b></font>) hair, unconscious yet harmonious, and as
attractive to many as beauty itself. Amy's nose still afflicted her (<font color='blue'><b>Amy</b></font>),
for it never would grow Grecian, so did her (<font color='blue'><b>Amy</b></font>) mouth, being too wide, and
having a decided chin. These offending features gave character to her (<font color='blue'><b>Amy</b></font>)
whole face, but she (<font color='blue'><b>Amy</b></font>) never could see it, and consoled herself with her (<font color='blue'><b>Amy</b></font>)
wonderfully fair complexion, keen blue eyes, and curls more golden and
abundant than ever.

<p/>All three wore suits of thin silver gray -LRB-their best gowns for the
summer-RRB-, with blush roses in hair and bosom, and all three looked just
what they were, fresh-faced, happy-hearted girls, pausing a moment in
their busy lives to read with wistful eyes the sweetest chapter in the
romance of womanhood.

<p/>There were to be no ceremonious performances, everything was to be as
natural and homelike as possible, so when Aunt March arrived, she (<font color='blue'><b>Aunt</b></font>) was
scandalized to see the bride come running to welcome and lead her (<font color='blue'><b>Aunt</b></font>) in,
to find the bridegroom fastening up a garland that had fallen down, and
to catch a glimpse of the paternal minister marching upstairs with a
grave countenance and a wine bottle under each arm.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Upon my word, here's a state of things!''  (<font color='red'><b>the lady</b></font>)</div>cried the old lady, taking
the seat of honor prepared for her (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>), and settling the folds of her (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>)
lavender moire with a great rustle. <div class="bookquote">``You oughtn't to be seen till the
last minute, child.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I'm not a show, Aunty, and no one is coming to stare at me, to
criticize my dress, or count the cost of my luncheon. I'm too happy to
care what anyone says or thinks, and I'm going to have my little
wedding just as I like it. John, dear, here's your hammer.''  (<font color='red'><b>Meg</b></font>)</div>And away
went Meg to help `that man' in his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) highly improper employment.

<p/>Mr. Brooke didn't even say, <div class="bookquote">``Thank you,''  (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Brooke/Brooke</b></font>)</div>but as he (<font color='blue'><b>Brooke</b></font>) stooped for the
unromantic tool, he (<font color='blue'><b>Brooke</b></font>) kissed his (<font color='blue'><b>Brooke</b></font>) little bride behind the folding door,
with a look that made Aunt March whisk out her (<font color='blue'><b>Aunt</b></font>) pocket handkerchief with
a sudden dew in her (<font color='blue'><b>Aunt</b></font>) sharp old eyes.

<p/>A crash, a cry, and a laugh from Laurie, accompanied by the indecorous
exclamation, <div class="bookquote">``Jupiter Ammon! Jo's upset the cake again!''  (<font color='red'><b>Laurie/Mr. Laurie/LAURIE</b></font>)</div>caused a
momentary flurry, which was hardly over when a flock of cousins
arrived, and `the party came in', as Beth used to say when a child.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Don't let that young giant come near me, he (<font color='blue'><b>Ammon</b></font>) worries me worse than
mosquitoes,''  (<font color='red'><b>the lady</b></font>)</div>whispered the old lady to Amy, as the rooms filled and
Laurie's black head towered above the rest.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``He (<font color='blue'><b>Ammon</b></font>) has promised to be very good today, and he (<font color='blue'><b>Ammon</b></font>) can be perfectly elegant
if he (<font color='blue'><b>Ammon</b></font>) likes,''  (<font color='red'><b>Amy/Amy March</b></font>)</div>returned Amy, and gliding away to warn Hercules to beware
of the dragon, which warning caused him (<font color='blue'><b>Hercules</b></font>) to haunt the old lady with a
devotion that nearly distracted her (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>).

<p/>There was no bridal procession, but a sudden silence fell upon the room
as Mr. March and the young couple took their places under the green
arch. Mother and sisters gathered close, as if loath to give Meg up.
The fatherly voice broke more than once, which only seemed to make the
service more beautiful and solemn. The bridegroom's hand trembled
visibly, and no one heard his (<font color='blue'><b>bridegroom</b></font>) replies. But Meg looked straight up in
her (<font color='blue'><b>Meg</b></font>) husband's eyes, and said, <div class="bookquote">``I will!''  (<font color='red'><b>husband</b></font>)</div>with such tender trust in her (<font color='blue'><b>Meg</b></font>)
own face and voice that her (<font color='blue'><b>Meg</b></font>) mother's heart rejoiced and Aunt March
sniffed audibly.

<p/>Jo did not cry, though she (<font color='blue'><b>Jo</b></font>) was very near it once, and was only saved
from a demonstration by the consciousness that Laurie was staring
fixedly at her (<font color='blue'><b>Jo</b></font>), with a comical mixture of merriment and emotion in his (<font color='blue'><b>Laurie</b></font>)
wicked black eyes. Beth kept her (<font color='blue'><b>Beth</b></font>) face hidden on her (<font color='blue'><b>Beth</b></font>) mother's shoulder,
but Amy stood like a graceful statue, with a most becoming ray of
sunshine touching her (<font color='blue'><b>Amy</b></font>) white forehead and the flower in her (<font color='blue'><b>Amy</b></font>) hair.

<p/>It wasn't at all the thing, I'm afraid, but the minute she (<font color='blue'><b>Amy</b></font>) was fairly
married, Meg cried, <div class="bookquote">``The first kiss for Marmee!''  (<font color='red'><b>Meg</b></font>)</div>and turning, gave it
with her (<font color='blue'><b>Meg</b></font>) heart on her (<font color='blue'><b>Meg</b></font>) lips. During the next fifteen minutes she (<font color='blue'><b>Meg</b></font>) looked
more like a rose than ever, for everyone availed themselves of their
privileges to the fullest extent, from Mr. Laurence to old Hannah, who,
adorned with a headdress fearfully and wonderfully made, fell upon her (<font color='blue'><b>Hannah</b></font>)
in the hall, crying with a sob and a chuckle, <div class="bookquote">``Bless you, deary, a
hundred times! The cake ain't hurt a mite, and everything looks
lovely.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Hannah</b></font>)</div><p/>Everybody cleared up after that, and said something brilliant, or tried
to, which did just as well, for laughter is ready when hearts are
light. There was no display of gifts, for they were already in the
little house, nor was there an elaborate breakfast, but a plentiful
lunch of cake and fruit, dressed with flowers. Mr. Laurence and Aunt
March shrugged and smiled at one another when water, lemonade, and
coffee were found to be to only sorts of nectar which the three Hebes
carried round. No one said anything, till Laurie, who insisted on
serving the bride, appeared before her (<font color='blue'><b>bride</b></font>), with a loaded salver in his (<font color='blue'><b>Laurie</b></font>)
hand and a puzzled expression on his (<font color='blue'><b>Laurie</b></font>) face.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Has Jo smashed all the bottles by accident?''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Laurie</b></font>) whispered, <div class="bookquote">``or am I
merely laboring under a delusion that I saw some lying about loose this
morning?''

 (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``No, your grandfather kindly offered us his (<font color='blue'><b>grandfather</b></font>) best, and Aunt March
actually sent some, but Father put away a little for Beth, and
dispatched the rest to the Soldier's Home. You know he (<font color='blue'><b>Father</b></font>) thinks that
wine should be used only in illness, and Mother says that neither she (<font color='blue'><b>Mother</b></font>)
nor her (<font color='blue'><b>Mother</b></font>) daughters will ever offer it to any young man under her (<font color='blue'><b>Mother</b></font>) roof.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Meg</b></font>)</div><p/>Meg spoke seriously and expected to see Laurie frown or laugh, but he (<font color='blue'><b>Laurie</b></font>)
did neither, for after a quick look at her (<font color='blue'><b>Meg</b></font>), he (<font color='blue'><b>Laurie</b></font>) said, in his (<font color='blue'><b>Laurie</b></font>) impetuous
way, <div class="bookquote">``I like that! For I've seen enough harm done to wish other women
would think as you do.''

 (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``You are not made wise by experience, I hope?''  (<font color='red'><b>Meg</b></font>)</div>and there was an anxious
accent in Meg's voice.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``No. I give you my word for it. Don't think too well of me, either,
this is not one of my temptations. Being brought up where wine is as
common as water and almost as harmless, I don't care for it, but when a
pretty girl offers it, one doesn't like to refuse, you see.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``But you will, for the sake of others, if not for your own. Come,
Laurie, promise, and give me one more reason to call this the happiest
day of my life.''

 (<font color='red'><b>the man</b></font>)</div><p/>A demand so sudden and so serious made the young man hesitate a moment,
for ridicule is often harder to bear than self-denial. Meg knew that if
he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) gave the promise he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) would keep it at all costs, and feeling her (<font color='blue'><b>Meg</b></font>)
power, used it as a woman may for her (<font color='blue'><b>Meg</b></font>) friend's good. She (<font color='blue'><b>Meg</b></font>) did not speak,
but she (<font color='blue'><b>Meg</b></font>) looked up at him (<font color='blue'><b>friend</b></font>) with a face made very eloquent by happiness,
and a smile which said, <div class="bookquote">``No one can refuse me anything today.''

 (<font color='red'><b>him</b></font>)</div><p/>Laurie certainly could not, and with an answering smile, he (<font color='blue'><b>Laurie</b></font>) gave her (<font color='blue'><b>Meg</b></font>)
his (<font color='blue'><b>Laurie</b></font>) hand, saying heartily, <div class="bookquote">``I promise, Mrs. Brooke!''

 (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I thank you, very, very much.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``And I drink `long life to your resolution', Teddy,''  (<font color='red'><b>Jo/Miss Jo/JO</b></font>)</div>cried Jo,
baptizing him (<font color='blue'><b>Laurie</b></font>) with a splash of lemonade, as she (<font color='blue'><b>Meg</b></font>) waved her (<font color='blue'><b>Meg</b></font>) glass and
beamed approvingly upon him (<font color='blue'><b>Laurie</b></font>).

<p/>So the toast was drunk, the pledge made and loyally kept in spite of
many temptations, for with instinctive wisdom, the girls seized a happy
moment to do their friend a service, for which he (<font color='blue'><b>friend</b></font>) thanked them all his (<font color='blue'><b>friend</b></font>)
life.

<p/>After lunch, people strolled about, by twos and threes, through the
house and garden, enjoying the sunshine without and within. Meg and
John happened to be standing together in the middle of the grass plot,
when Laurie was seized with an inspiration which put the finishing
touch to this unfashionable wedding.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``All the married people take hands and dance round the new-made husband
and wife, as the Germans do, while we bachelors and spinsters prance in
couples outside!''  (<font color='red'><b>Laurie/Mr. Laurie/LAURIE</b></font>)</div>cried Laurie, promenading down the path with Amy,
with such infectious spirit and skill that everyone else followed their
example without a murmur. Mr. and Mrs. March, Aunt and Uncle Carrol
began it, others rapidly joined in, even Sallie Moffat, after a
moment's hesitation, threw her (<font color='blue'><b>Carrol</b></font>) train over her (<font color='blue'><b>Carrol</b></font>) arm and whisked Ned into
the ring. But the crowning joke was Mr. Laurence and Aunt March, for
when the stately old gentleman chasseed solemnly up to the old lady,
she (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) just tucked her (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) cane under her (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) arm, and hopped briskly away to join
hands with the rest and dance about the bridal pair, while the young
folks pervaded the garden like butterflies on a midsummer day.

<p/>Want of breath brought the impromptu ball to a close, and then people
began to go.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``I wish you well, my dear, I heartily wish you well, but I think you'll
be sorry for it,''  (<font color='red'><b>Aunt</b></font>)</div>said Aunt March to Meg, adding to the bridegroom, as
he (<font color='blue'><b>bridegroom</b></font>) led her (<font color='blue'><b>Meg</b></font>) to the carriage, <div class="bookquote">``You've got a treasure, young man, see that
you deserve it.''

 (<font color='red'><b>her</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``That is the prettiest wedding I've been to for an age, Ned, and I
don't see why, for there wasn't a bit of style about it,''  (<font color='red'><b>Mrs. Moffat</b></font>)</div>observed Mrs.
Moffat to her (<font color='blue'><b>Moffat</b></font>) husband, as they drove away.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Laurie, my lad, if you ever want to indulge in this sort of thing, get
one of those little girls to help you, and I shall be perfectly
satisfied,''  (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Laurence/Laurence/LAURENCE</b></font>)</div>said Mr. Laurence, settling himself in his (<font color='blue'><b>Laurence</b></font>) easy chair to
rest after the excitement of the morning.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``I'll do my best to gratify you, Sir,''  (<font color='red'><b>Laurie/Mr. Laurie/LAURIE</b></font>)</div>was Laurie's unusually dutiful
reply, as he (<font color='blue'><b>Laurie</b></font>) carefully unpinned the posy Jo had put in his (<font color='blue'><b>Laurie</b></font>) buttonhole.

<p/>The little house was not far away, and the only bridal journey Meg had
was the quiet walk with John from the old home to the new. When she (<font color='blue'><b>John</b></font>)
came down, looking like a pretty Quakeress in her (<font color='blue'><b>John</b></font>) dove-colored suit and
straw bonnet tied with white, they all gathered about her (<font color='blue'><b>John</b></font>) to say
`good-by', as tenderly as if she (<font color='blue'><b>John</b></font>) had been going to make the grand tour.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Don't feel that I am separated from you, Marmee dear, or that I love
you any the less for loving John so much,''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>John</b></font>) said, clinging to her (<font color='blue'><b>John</b></font>)
mother, with full eyes for a moment. <div class="bookquote">``I shall come every day, Father,
and expect to keep my old place in all your hearts, though I am
married. Beth is going to be with me a great deal, and the other girls
will drop in now and then to laugh at my housekeeping struggles. Thank
you all for my happy wedding day. Good-by, good-by!''

 (<font color='red'><b>her</b></font>)</div><p/>They stood watching her (<font color='blue'><b>John</b></font>), with faces full of love and hope and tender
pride as she (<font color='blue'><b>John</b></font>) walked away, leaning on her (<font color='blue'><b>John</b></font>) husband's arm, with her (<font color='blue'><b>John</b></font>) hands
full of flowers and the June sunshine brightening her (<font color='blue'><b>John</b></font>) happy face--and
so Meg's married life began.



<p/>CHAPTER TWENTY-SIX

<p/>ARTISTIC ATTEMPTS

<p/>It takes people a long time to learn the difference between talent and
genius, especially ambitious young men and women. Amy was learning
this distinction through much tribulation, for mistaking enthusiasm for
inspiration, she (<font color='blue'><b>Amy</b></font>) attempted every branch of art with youthful audacity.
For a long time there was a lull in the `mud-pie' business, and she (<font color='blue'><b>Amy</b></font>)
devoted herself to the finest pen-and-ink drawing, in which she (<font color='blue'><b>Amy</b></font>) showed
such taste and skill that her (<font color='blue'><b>Amy</b></font>) graceful handiwork proved both pleasant
and profitable. But over-strained eyes caused pen and ink to be laid
aside for a bold attempt at poker-sketching. While this attack lasted,
the family lived in constant fear of a conflagration, for the odor of
burning wood pervaded the house at all hours, smoke issued from attic
and shed with alarming frequency, red-hot pokers lay about
promiscuously, and Hannah never went to bed without a pail of water and
the dinner bell at her (<font color='blue'><b>Hannah</b></font>) door in case of fire. Raphael's face was found
boldly executed on the underside of the moulding board, and Bacchus on
the head of a beer barrel. A chanting cherub adorned the cover of the
sugar bucket, and attempts to portray Romeo and Juliet supplied
kindling for some time.

<p/>From fire to oil was a natural transition for burned fingers, and Amy
fell to painting with undiminished ardor. An artist friend fitted her (<font color='blue'><b>Amy</b></font>)
out with his (<font color='blue'><b>friend</b></font>) castoff palettes, brushes, and colors, and she (<font color='blue'><b>Amy</b></font>) daubed
away, producing pastoral and marine views such as were never seen on
land or sea. Her (<font color='blue'><b>Amy</b></font>) monstrosities in the way of cattle would have taken
prizes at an agricultural fair, and the perilous pitching of her (<font color='blue'><b>Amy</b></font>)
vessels would have produced seasickness in the most nautical observer,
if the utter disregard to all known rules of shipbuilding and rigging
had not convulsed him (<font color='blue'><b>friend</b></font>) with laughter at the first glance. Swarthy boys
and dark-eyed Madonnas, staring at you from one corner of the studio,
suggested Murillo; oily brown shadows of faces with a lurid streak in
the wrong place, meant Rembrandt; buxom ladies and dropiscal infants,
Rubens; and Turner appeared in tempests of blue thunder, orange
lightning, brown rain, and purple clouds, with a tomato-colored splash
in the middle, which might be the sun or a bouy, a sailor's shirt or a
king's robe, as the spectator pleased.

<p/>Charcoal portraits came next, and the entire family hung in a row,
looking as wild and crocky as if just evoked from a coalbin. Softened
into crayon sketches, they did better, for the likenesses were good,
and Amy's hair, Jo's nose, Meg's mouth, and Laurie's eyes were
pronounced `wonderfully fine'. A return to clay and plaster followed,
and ghostly casts of her (<font color='blue'><b>Meg</b></font>) acquaintances haunted corners of the house, or
tumbled off closet shelves onto people's heads. Children were enticed
in as models, till their incoherent accounts of her (<font color='blue'><b>Meg</b></font>) mysterious doings
caused Miss Amy to be regarded in the light of a young ogress. Her (<font color='blue'><b>Amy</b></font>)
efforts in this line, however, were brought to an abrupt close by an
untoward accident, which quenched her (<font color='blue'><b>Amy</b></font>) ardor. Other models failing her (<font color='blue'><b>Amy</b></font>)
for a time, she (<font color='blue'><b>Amy</b></font>) undertook to cast her (<font color='blue'><b>Amy</b></font>) own pretty foot, and the family
were one day alarmed by an unearthly bumping and screaming and running
to the rescue, found the young enthusiast hopping wildly about the shed
with her (<font color='blue'><b>Amy</b></font>) foot held fast in a pan full of plaster, which had hardened
with unexpected rapidity. With much difficulty and some danger she (<font color='blue'><b>Amy</b></font>) was
dug out, for Jo was so overcome with laughter while she (<font color='blue'><b>Jo</b></font>) excavated that
her (<font color='blue'><b>Jo</b></font>) knife went too far, cut the poor foot, and left a lasting memorial
of one artistic attempt, at least.

<p/>After this Amy subsided, till a mania for sketching from nature set her (<font color='blue'><b>Amy</b></font>)
to haunting river, field, and wood, for picturesque studies, and
sighing for ruins to copy. She (<font color='blue'><b>Amy</b></font>) caught endless colds sitting on damp
grass to book 'a delicious bit', composed of a stone, a stump, one
mushroom, and a broken mullein stalk, or 'a heavenly mass of clouds',
that looked like a choice display of featherbeds when done. She (<font color='blue'><b>Amy</b></font>)
sacrificed her (<font color='blue'><b>Amy</b></font>) complexion floating on the river in the midsummer sun to
study light and shade, and got a wrinkle over her (<font color='blue'><b>Amy</b></font>) nose trying after
`points of sight', or whatever the squint-and-string performance is
called.

<p/>If `genius is eternal patience', as Michelangelo affirms, Amy had some
claim to the divine attribute, for she (<font color='blue'><b>Amy</b></font>) persevered in spite of all
obstacles, failures, and discouragements, firmly believing that in time
she (<font color='blue'><b>Amy</b></font>) should do something worthy to be called `high art'.

<p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>Amy</b></font>) was learning, doing, and enjoying other things, meanwhile, for she (<font color='blue'><b>Amy</b></font>)
had resolved to be an attractive and accomplished woman, even if she (<font color='blue'><b>Amy</b></font>)
never became a great artist. Here she (<font color='blue'><b>Amy</b></font>) succeeded better, for she (<font color='blue'><b>Amy</b></font>) was
one of those happily created beings who please without effort, make
friends everywhere, and take life so gracefully and easily that less
fortunate souls are tempted to believe that such are born under a lucky
star. Everybody liked her (<font color='blue'><b>Amy</b></font>), for among her (<font color='blue'><b>Amy</b></font>) good gifts was tact. She (<font color='blue'><b>Amy</b></font>) had
an instinctive sense of what was pleasing and proper, always said the
right thing to the right person, did just what suited the time and
place, and was so self-possessed that her (<font color='blue'><b>Amy</b></font>) sisters used to say, <div class="bookquote">``If Amy
went to court without any rehearsal beforehand, she (<font color='blue'><b>Amy</b></font>)'d know exactly what
to do.''

 (<font color='red'><b>sisters</b></font>)</div><p/>One of her (<font color='blue'><b>Amy</b></font>) weaknesses was a desire to move in `our best society',
without being quite sure what the best really was. Money, position,
fashionable accomplishments, and elegant manners were most desirable
things in her (<font color='blue'><b>Amy</b></font>) eyes, and she (<font color='blue'><b>Amy</b></font>) liked to associate with those who possessed
them, often mistaking the false for the true, and admiring what was not
admirable. Never forgetting that by birth she (<font color='blue'><b>Amy</b></font>) was a gentlewoman, she (<font color='blue'><b>Amy</b></font>)
cultivated her (<font color='blue'><b>Amy</b></font>) aristocratic tastes and feelings, so that when the
opportunity came she (<font color='blue'><b>Amy</b></font>) might be ready to take the place from which
poverty now excluded her (<font color='blue'><b>Amy</b></font>).

<p/><div class="bookquote">``My lady,''  (<font color='red'><b>friends</b></font>)</div>as her (<font color='blue'><b>Amy</b></font>) friends called her (<font color='blue'><b>Amy</b></font>), sincerely desired to be a genuine
lady, and was so at heart, but had yet to learn that money cannot buy
refinement of nature, that rank does not always confer nobility, and
that true breeding makes itself felt in spite of external drawbacks.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``I want to ask a favor of you, Mamma,''  (<font color='red'><b>Amy/Amy March</b></font>)</div>Amy said, coming in with an
important air one day.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Well, little girl, what is it?''  (<font color='red'><b>mother</b></font>)</div>replied her (<font color='blue'><b>Amy</b></font>) mother, in whose eyes the
stately young lady still remained `the baby'.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Our drawing class breaks up next week, and before the girls separate
for the summer, I want to ask them out here for a day. They are wild
to see the river, sketch the broken bridge, and copy some of the things
they admire in my book. They have been very kind to me in many ways,
and I am grateful, for they are all rich and I know I am poor, yet they
never made any difference.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Why should they?''  (<font color='red'><b>the girls</b></font>)</div>and Mrs. March put the question with what the girls
called her (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) ``Maria Theresa air'.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``You know as well as I that it does make a difference with nearly
everyone, so don't ruffle up like a dear, motherly hen, when your
chickens get pecked by smarter birds. The ugly duckling turned out a
swan, you know.''  (<font color='red'><b>Amy/Amy March</b></font>)</div>and Amy smiled without bitterness, for she (<font color='blue'><b>Amy</b></font>) possessed
a happy temper and hopeful spirit.

<p/>Mrs. March laughed, and smoothed down her (<font color='blue'><b>Amy</b></font>) maternal pride as she (<font color='blue'><b>Amy</b></font>) asked,
<div class="bookquote">``Well, my swan, what is your plan?''

 (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I should like to ask the girls out to lunch next week, to take them
for a drive to the places they want to see, a row on the river,
perhaps, and make a little artistic fete for them.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``That looks feasible. What do you want for lunch? Cake, sandwiches,
fruit, and coffee will be all that is necessary, I suppose?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Oh, dear, no! We must have cold tongue and chicken, French chocolate
and ice cream, besides. The girls are used to such things, and I want
my lunch to be proper and elegant, though I do work for my living.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``How many young ladies are there?''  (<font color='red'><b>mother</b></font>)</div>asked her (<font color='blue'><b>Amy</b></font>) mother, beginning to look
sober.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Twelve or fourteen in the class, but I dare say they won't all come.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Bless me, child, you will have to charter an omnibus to carry them
about.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Why, Mother, how can you think of such a thing? Not more than six or
eight will probably come, so I shall hire a beach wagon and borrow Mr.
Laurence's cherry-bounce.''  (<font color='red'><b>Hannah</b></font>)</div>-LRB-Hannah's pronunciation of char-a-banc.-RRB-

<p/><div class="bookquote">``All of this will be expensive, Amy.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Not very. I've calculated the cost, and I'll pay for it myself.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Don't you think, dear, that as these girls are used to such things,
and the best we can do will be nothing new, that some simpler plan
would be pleasanter to them, as a change if nothing more, and much
better for us than buying or borrowing what we don't need, and
attempting a style not in keeping with our circumstances?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``If I can't have it as I like, I don't care to have it at all. I know
that I can carry it out perfectly well, if you and the girls will help
a little, and I don't see why I can't if I'm willing to pay for it,''
 (<font color='red'><b>Amy/Amy March</b></font>)</div>said Amy, with the decision which opposition was apt to change into
obstinacy.

<p/>Mrs. March knew that experience was an excellent teacher, and when it
was possible she (<font color='blue'><b>Amy</b></font>) left her (<font color='blue'><b>Amy</b></font>) children to learn alone the lessons which she (<font color='blue'><b>Amy</b></font>)
would gladly have made easier, if they had not objected to taking
advice as much as they did salts and senna.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Very well, Amy, if your heart is set upon it, and you see your way
through without too great an outlay of money, time, and temper, I'll
say no more. Talk it over with the girls, and whichever way you
decide, I'll do my best to help you.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Thanks, Mother, you are always so kind.''  (<font color='red'><b>Amy/Amy March</b></font>)</div>and away went Amy to lay her (<font color='blue'><b>Amy</b></font>)
plan before her (<font color='blue'><b>Amy</b></font>) sisters.

<p/>Meg agreed at once, and promised her (<font color='blue'><b>Meg</b></font>) aid, gladly offering anything she (<font color='blue'><b>Meg</b></font>)
possessed, from her (<font color='blue'><b>Meg</b></font>) little house itself to her (<font color='blue'><b>Meg</b></font>) very best saltspoons.
But Jo frowned upon the whole project and would have nothing to do with
it at first.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Why in the world should you spend your money, worry your family, and
turn the house upside down for a parcel of girls who don't care a
sixpence for you? I thought you had too much pride and sense to
truckle to any mortal woman just because she (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) wears French boots and
rides in a coupe,''  (<font color='red'><b>Jo/Miss Jo/JO</b></font>)</div>said Jo, who, being called from the tragic climax of
her (<font color='blue'><b>Jo</b></font>) novel, was not in the best mood for social enterprises.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``I don't truckle, and I hate being patronized as much as you do!''
 (<font color='red'><b>Amy/Amy March</b></font>)</div>returned Amy indignantly, for the two still jangled when such questions
arose. <div class="bookquote">``The girls do care for me, and I for them, and there's a great
deal of kindness and sense and talent among them, in spite of what you
call fashionable nonsense. You don't care to make people like you, to
go into good society, and cultivate your manners and tastes. I do, and
I mean to make the most of every chance that comes. You can go through
the world with your elbows out and your nose in the air, and call it
independence, if you like. That's not my way.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Amy/Amy March</b></font>)</div><p/>When Amy had whetted her (<font color='blue'><b>Amy</b></font>) tongue and freed her (<font color='blue'><b>Amy</b></font>) mind she (<font color='blue'><b>Amy</b></font>) usually got the
best of it, for she (<font color='blue'><b>Amy</b></font>) seldom failed to have common sense on her (<font color='blue'><b>Amy</b></font>) side,
while Jo carried her (<font color='blue'><b>Jo</b></font>) love of liberty and hate of conventionalities to
such an unlimited extent that she (<font color='blue'><b>Jo</b></font>) naturally found herself worsted in an
argument. Amy's definition of Jo's idea of independence was such a
good hit that both burst out laughing, and the discussion took a more
amiable turn. Much against her (<font color='blue'><b>Jo</b></font>) will, Jo at length consented to
sacrifice a day to Mrs. Grundy, and help her (<font color='blue'><b>Jo</b></font>) sister through what she (<font color='blue'><b>Jo</b></font>)
regarded as 'a nonsensical business'.

<p/>The invitations were sent, nearly all accepted, and the following
Monday was set apart for the grand event. Hannah was out of humor
because her (<font color='blue'><b>Hannah</b></font>) week's work was deranged, and prophesied that <div class="bookquote">``ef the
washin' and ironin' warn't done reg`lar, nothin' would go well
anywheres'' (<font color='red'><b>Hannah</b></font>)</div>. This hitch in the mainspring of the domestic machinery had
a bad effect upon the whole concern, but Amy's motto was ``Nil
desperandum', and having made up her (<font color='blue'><b>it</b></font>) mind what to do, she (<font color='blue'><b>it</b></font>) proceeded to
do it in spite of all obstacles. To begin with, Hannah's cooking
didn't turn out well. The chicken was tough, the tongue too salty, and
the chocolate wouldn't froth properly. Then the cake and ice cost more
than Amy expected, so did the wagon, and various other expenses, which
seemed trifling at the outset, counted up rather alarmingly afterward.
Beth got a cold and took to her (<font color='blue'><b>Beth</b></font>) bed. Meg had an unusual number of
callers to keep her (<font color='blue'><b>Meg</b></font>) at home, and Jo was in such a divided state of mind
that her (<font color='blue'><b>Jo</b></font>) breakages, accidents, and mistakes were uncommonly numerous,
serious, and trying.

<p/>If it was not fair on Monday, the young ladies were to come on Tuesday,
an arrangement which aggravated Jo and Hannah to the last degree. On
Monday morning the weather was in that undecided state which is more
exasperating than a steady pour. It drizzled a little, shone a little,
blew a little, and didn't make up its mind till it was too late for
anyone else to make up theirs. Amy was up at dawn, hustling people out
of their beds and through their breakfasts, that the house might be got
in order. The parlor struck her (<font color='blue'><b>Amy</b></font>) as looking uncommonly shabby, but
without stopping to sigh for what she (<font color='blue'><b>Amy</b></font>) had not, she (<font color='blue'><b>Amy</b></font>) skillfully made the
best of what she (<font color='blue'><b>Amy</b></font>) had, arranging chairs over the worn places in the
carpet, covering stains on the walls with homemade statuary, which gave
an artistic air to the room, as did the lovely vases of flowers Jo
scattered about.

<p/>The lunch looked charming, and as she (<font color='blue'><b>Jo</b></font>) surveyed it, she (<font color='blue'><b>Jo</b></font>) sincerely hoped
it would taste well, and that the borrowed glass, china, and silver
would get safely home again. The carriages were promised, Meg and
Mother were all ready to do the honors, Beth was able to help Hannah
behind the scenes, Jo had engaged to be as lively and amiable as an
absent mind, and aching head, and a very decided disapproval of
everybody and everything would allow, and as she (<font color='blue'><b>Jo</b></font>) wearily dressed, Amy
cheered herself with anticipations of the happy moment when, lunch
safely over, she (<font color='blue'><b>Amy</b></font>) should drive away with her (<font color='blue'><b>Amy</b></font>) friends for an afternoon of
artistic delights, for the `cherry bounce' and the broken bridge were
her (<font color='blue'><b>Amy</b></font>) strong points.

<p/>Then came the hours of suspense, during which she (<font color='blue'><b>Amy</b></font>) vibrated from parlor
to porch, while public opinion varied like the weathercock. A smart
shower at eleven had evidently quenched the enthusiasm of the young
ladies who were to arrive at twelve, for nobody came, and at two the
exhausted family sat down in a blaze of sunshine to consume the
perishable portions of the feast, that nothing might be lost.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``No doubt about the weather today, they will certainly come, so we must
fly round and be ready for them,''  (<font color='red'><b>Amy/Amy March</b></font>)</div>said Amy, as the sun woke her (<font color='blue'><b>Amy</b></font>) next
morning. She (<font color='blue'><b>Amy</b></font>) spoke briskly, but in her (<font color='blue'><b>Amy</b></font>) secret soul she (<font color='blue'><b>Amy</b></font>) wished she (<font color='blue'><b>Amy</b></font>) had
said nothing about Tuesday, for her (<font color='blue'><b>Amy</b></font>) interest like her (<font color='blue'><b>Amy</b></font>) cake was getting
a little stale.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``I can't get any lobsters, so you will have to do without salad today,''
 (<font color='red'><b>Mr.</b></font>)</div>said Mr. March, coming in half an hour later, with an expression of
placid despair.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Use the chicken then, the toughness won't matter in a salad,''  (<font color='red'><b>wife</b></font>)</div>advised
his (<font color='blue'><b>Mr.</b></font>) wife.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Hannah left it on the kitchen table a minute, and the kittens got at
it. I'm very sorry, Amy,''  (<font color='red'><b>Beth</b></font>)</div>added Beth, who was still a patroness of
cats.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Then I must have a lobster, for tongue alone won't do,''  (<font color='red'><b>Amy/Amy March</b></font>)</div>said Amy
decidedly.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Shall I rush into town and demand one?''  (<font color='red'><b>Jo/Miss Jo/JO</b></font>)</div>asked Jo, with the magnanimity
of a martyr.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``You'd come bringing it home under your arm without any paper, just to
try me. I'll go myself,''  (<font color='red'><b>Amy/Amy March</b></font>)</div>answered Amy, whose temper was beginning to
fail.

<p/>Shrouded in a thick veil and armed with a genteel traveling basket, she (<font color='blue'><b>Amy</b></font>)
departed, feeling that a cool drive would soothe her (<font color='blue'><b>Amy</b></font>) ruffled spirit and
fit her (<font color='blue'><b>Amy</b></font>) for the labors of the day. After some delay, the object of her (<font color='blue'><b>Amy</b></font>)
desire was procured, likewise a bottle of dressing to prevent further
loss of time at home, and off she (<font color='blue'><b>Amy</b></font>) drove again, well pleased with her (<font color='blue'><b>Amy</b></font>)
own forethought.

<p/>As the omnibus contained only one other passenger, a sleepy old lady,
Amy pocketed her (<font color='blue'><b>Amy</b></font>) veil and beguiled the tedium of the way by trying to
find out where all her (<font color='blue'><b>Amy</b></font>) money had gone to. So busy was she (<font color='blue'><b>Amy</b></font>) with her (<font color='blue'><b>Amy</b></font>)
card full of refractory figures that she (<font color='blue'><b>Amy</b></font>) did not observe a newcomer,
who entered without stopping the vehicle, till a masculine voice said,
<div class="bookquote">``Good morning, Miss March,''  (<font color='red'><b>a newcomer</b></font>)</div>and, looking up, she (<font color='blue'><b>Amy</b></font>) beheld one of Laurie's
most elegant college friends. Fervently hoping that he (<font color='blue'><b>Laurie</b></font>) would get out
before she (<font color='blue'><b>Amy</b></font>) did, Amy utterly ignored the basket at her (<font color='blue'><b>Amy</b></font>) feet, and
congratulating herself that she (<font color='blue'><b>Amy</b></font>) had on her (<font color='blue'><b>Amy</b></font>) new traveling dress,
returned the young man's greeting with her (<font color='blue'><b>Amy</b></font>) usual suavity and spirit.

<p/>They got on excellently, for Amy's chief care was soon set at rest by
learning that the gentleman would leave first, and she (<font color='blue'><b>Amy</b></font>) was chatting
away in a peculiarly lofty strain, when the old lady got out. In
stumbling to the door, she (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) upset the basket, and--oh horror!--the
lobster, in all its vulgar size and brilliancy, was revealed to the
highborn eyes of a Tudor!

<p/><div class="bookquote">``By Jove, she (<font color='blue'><b>Amy</b></font>)'s forgotten her (<font color='blue'><b>Amy</b></font>) dinner!''  (<font color='red'><b>the youth</b></font>)</div>cried the unconscious youth,
poking the scarlet monster into its place with his (<font color='blue'><b>Tudor</b></font>) cane, and preparing
to hand out the basket after the old lady.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Please don't--it's--it's mine,''  (<font color='red'><b>Amy/Amy March</b></font>)</div>murmured Amy, with a face nearly as
red as her (<font color='blue'><b>Amy</b></font>) fish.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Oh, really, I beg pardon. It's an uncommonly fine one, isn't it?''
 (<font color='red'><b>Tudor/Mr. Tudor</b></font>)</div>said Tudor, with great presence of mind, and an air of sober interest
that did credit to his (<font color='blue'><b>Tudor</b></font>) breeding.

<p/>Amy recovered herself in a breath, set her (<font color='blue'><b>Amy</b></font>) basket boldly on the seat,
and said, laughing, <div class="bookquote">``Don't you wish you were to have some of the salad
he (<font color='blue'><b>I</b></font>)'s going to make, and to see the charming young ladies who are to eat
it?''

 (<font color='red'><b>Amy/Amy March</b></font>)</div><p/>Now that was tact, for two of the ruling foibles of the masculine mind
were touched. The lobster was instantly surrounded by a halo of
pleasing reminiscences, and curiosity about `the charming young ladies'
diverted his (<font color='blue'><b>Tudor</b></font>) mind from the comical mishap.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``I suppose he (<font color='blue'><b>I</b></font>)'ll laugh and joke over it with Laurie, but I shan't see
them, that's a comfort,''  (<font color='red'><b>Amy/Amy March</b></font>)</div>thought Amy, as Tudor bowed and departed.

<p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>Amy</b></font>) did not mention this meeting at home -LRB-though she (<font color='blue'><b>Amy</b></font>) discovered that,
thanks to the upset, her (<font color='blue'><b>Amy</b></font>) new dress was much damaged by the rivulets of
dressing that meandered down the skirt-RRB-, but went through with the
preparations which now seemed more irksome than before, and at twelve
o'clock all was ready again. Feeling that the neighbors were
interested in her (<font color='blue'><b>Amy</b></font>) movements, she (<font color='blue'><b>Amy</b></font>) wished to efface the memory of
yesterday's failure by a grand success today, so she (<font color='blue'><b>Amy</b></font>) ordered the
`cherry bounce', and drove away in state to meet and escort her (<font color='blue'><b>Amy</b></font>) guests
to the banquet.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``There's the rumble, they're coming! I'll go onto the porch and meet
them. It looks hospitable, and I want the poor child to have a good
time after all her (<font color='blue'><b>it</b></font>) trouble,''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>said Mrs. March, suiting the action to the
word. But after one glance, she (<font color='blue'><b>Amy</b></font>) retired, with an indescribable
expression, for looking quite lost in the big carriage, sat Amy and one
young lady.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Run, Beth, and help Hannah clear half the things off the table. It
will be too absurd to put a luncheon for twelve before a single girl,''
 (<font color='red'><b>Jo/Miss Jo/JO</b></font>)</div>cried Jo, hurrying away to the lower regions, too excited to stop even
for a laugh.

<p/>In came Amy, quite calm and delightfully cordial to the one guest who
had kept her (<font color='blue'><b>Amy</b></font>) promise. The rest of the family, being of a dramatic
turn, played their parts equally well, and Miss Eliott found them a
most hilarious set, for it was impossible to control entirely the
merriment which possessed them. The remodeled lunch being gaily
partaken of, the studio and garden visited, and art discussed with
enthusiasm, Amy ordered a buggy -LRB-alas for the elegant cherry-bounce-RRB-,
and drove her (<font color='blue'><b>Amy</b></font>) friend quietly about the neighborhood till sunset, when
`the party went out'.

<p/>As she (<font color='blue'><b>Amy</b></font>) came walking in, looking very tired but as composed as ever, she (<font color='blue'><b>Amy</b></font>)
observed that every vestige of the unfortunate fete had disappeared,
except a suspicious pucker about the corners of Jo's mouth.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``You've had a loverly afternoon for your drive, dear,''  (<font color='red'><b>mother</b></font>)</div>said her (<font color='blue'><b>Jo</b></font>) mother,
as respectfully as if the whole twelve had come.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Miss Eliott is a very sweet girl, and seemed to enjoy herself, I
thought,''  (<font color='red'><b>Beth</b></font>)</div>observed Beth, with unusual warmth.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Could you spare me some of your cake? I really need some, I have so
much company, and I can't make such delicious stuff as yours,''  (<font color='red'><b>Meg</b></font>)</div>asked
Meg soberly.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Take it all. I'm the only one here who likes sweet things, and it
will mold before I can dispose of it,''  (<font color='red'><b>Amy/Amy March</b></font>)</div>answered Amy, thinking with a
sigh of the generous store she (<font color='blue'><b>Amy</b></font>) had laid in for such an end as this.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``It's a pity Laurie isn't here to help us,''  (<font color='red'><b>Jo/Miss Jo/JO</b></font>)</div>began Jo, as they sat down
to ice cream and salad for the second time in two days.

<p/>A warning look from her (<font color='blue'><b>Jo</b></font>) mother checked any further remarks, and the
whole family ate in heroic silence, till Mr. March mildly observed,
<div class="bookquote">``salad was one of the favorite dishes of the ancients, and Evelyn...''
 (<font color='red'><b>Mr.</b></font>)</div>Here a general explosion of laughter cut short the `history of salads',
to the great surprise of the learned gentleman.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Bundle everything into a basket and send it to the Hummels. Germans
like messes. I'm sick of the sight of this, and there's no reason you
should all die of a surfeit because I've been a fool,''  (<font color='red'><b>Amy/Amy March</b></font>)</div>cried Amy,
wiping her (<font color='blue'><b>Amy</b></font>) eyes.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``I thought I should have died when I saw you two girls rattling about
in the what-you-call-it, like two little kernels in a very big
nutshell, and Mother waiting in state to receive the throng,''  (<font color='red'><b>Jo/Miss Jo/JO</b></font>)</div>sighed
Jo, quite spent with laughter.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``I'm very sorry you were disappointed, dear, but we all did our best to
satisfy you,''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>said Mrs. March, in a tone full of motherly regret.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``I am satisfied. I've done what I undertook, and it's not my fault
that it failed. I comfort myself with that,''  (<font color='red'><b>Amy/Amy March</b></font>)</div>said Amy with a little
quiver in her (<font color='blue'><b>Amy</b></font>) voice. <div class="bookquote">``I thank you all very much for helping me, and
I'll thank you still more if you won't allude to it for a month, at
least.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Laurie/Mr. Laurie/LAURIE</b></font>)</div><p/>No one did for several months, but the word `fete' always produced a
general smile, and Laurie's birthday gift to Amy was a tiny coral
lobster in the shape of a charm for her (<font color='blue'><b>Amy</b></font>) watch guard.



<p/>CHAPTER TWENTY-SEVEN

<p/>LITERARY LESSONS

<p/>Fortune suddenly smiled upon Jo, and dropped a good luck penny in her (<font color='blue'><b>Jo</b></font>)
path. Not a golden penny, exactly, but I doubt if half a million would
have given more real happiness then did the little sum that came to her (<font color='blue'><b>Jo</b></font>)
in this wise.

<p/>Every few weeks she (<font color='blue'><b>Jo</b></font>) would shut herself up in her (<font color='blue'><b>Jo</b></font>) room, put on her (<font color='blue'><b>Jo</b></font>)
scribbling suit, and `fall into a vortex', as she (<font color='blue'><b>Jo</b></font>) expressed it, writing
away at her (<font color='blue'><b>Jo</b></font>) novel with all her (<font color='blue'><b>Jo</b></font>) heart and soul, for till that was
finished she (<font color='blue'><b>Jo</b></font>) could find no peace. Her (<font color='blue'><b>Jo</b></font>) `scribbling suit' consisted of a
black woolen pinafore on which she (<font color='blue'><b>Jo</b></font>) could wipe her (<font color='blue'><b>Jo</b></font>) pen at will, and a
cap of the same material, adorned with a cheerful red bow, into which
she (<font color='blue'><b>Jo</b></font>) bundled her (<font color='blue'><b>Jo</b></font>) hair when the decks were cleared for action. This cap
was a beacon to the inquiring eyes of her (<font color='blue'><b>Jo</b></font>) family, who during these
periods kept their distance, merely popping in their heads
semi-occasionally to ask, with interest, <div class="bookquote">``Does genius burn, Jo?''  (<font color='red'><b>family</b></font>)</div>They
did not always venture even to ask this question, but took an
observation of the cap, and judged accordingly. If this expressive
article of dress was drawn low upon the forehead, it was a sign that
hard work was going on, in exciting moments it was pushed rakishly
askew, and when despair seized the author it was plucked wholly off,
and cast upon the floor. At such times the intruder silently withdrew,
and not until the red bow was seen gaily erect upon the gifted brow,
did anyone dare address Jo.

<p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>Jo</b></font>) did not think herself a genius by any means, but when the writing
fit came on, she (<font color='blue'><b>Jo</b></font>) gave herself up to it with entire abandon, and led a
blissful life, unconscious of want, care, or bad weather, while she (<font color='blue'><b>Jo</b></font>) sat
safe and happy in an imaginary world, full of friends almost as real
and dear to her (<font color='blue'><b>Jo</b></font>) as any in the flesh. Sleep forsook her (<font color='blue'><b>Jo</b></font>) eyes, meals
stood untasted, day and night were all too short to enjoy the happiness
which blessed her (<font color='blue'><b>Jo</b></font>) only at such times, and made these hours worth
living, even if they bore no other fruit. The divine afflatus usually
lasted a week or two, and then she (<font color='blue'><b>Jo</b></font>) emerged from her (<font color='blue'><b>Jo</b></font>) `vortex', hungry,
sleepy, cross, or despondent.

<p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>Jo</b></font>) was just recovering from one of these attacks when she (<font color='blue'><b>Jo</b></font>) was
prevailed upon to escort Miss Crocker to a lecture, and in return for
her (<font color='blue'><b>Jo</b></font>) virtue was rewarded with a new idea. It was a People's Course, the
lecture on the Pyramids, and Jo rather wondered at the choice of such a
subject for such an audience, but took it for granted that some great
social evil would be remedied or some great want supplied by unfolding
the glories of the Pharaohs to an audience whose thoughts were busy
with the price of coal and flour, and whose lives were spent in trying
to solve harder riddles than that of the Sphinx.

<p/>They were early, and while Miss Crocker set the heel of her (<font color='blue'><b>Crocker</b></font>) stocking,
Jo amused herself by examining the faces of the people who occupied the
seat with them. On her (<font color='blue'><b>Jo</b></font>) left were two matrons, with massive foreheads
and bonnets to match, discussing Women's Rights and making tatting.
Beyond sat a pair of humble lovers, artlessly holding each other by the
hand, a somber spinster eating peppermints out of a paper bag, and an
old gentleman taking his (<font color='blue'><b>gentleman</b></font>) preparatory nap behind a yellow bandanna. On
her (<font color='blue'><b>spinster</b></font>) right, her (<font color='blue'><b>spinster</b></font>) only neighbor was a studious looking lad absorbed in a
newspaper.

<p/>It was a pictorial sheet, and Jo examined the work of art nearest her (<font color='blue'><b>Jo</b></font>),
idly wondering what fortuitous concatenation of circumstances needed
the melodramatic illustration of an Indian in full war costume,
tumbling over a precipice with a wolf at his (<font color='blue'><b>wolf</b></font>) throat, while two
infuriated young gentlemen, with unnaturally small feet and big eyes,
were stabbing each other close by, and a disheveled female was flying
away in the background with her (<font color='blue'><b>female</b></font>) mouth wide open. Pausing to turn a
page, the lad saw her (<font color='blue'><b>female</b></font>) looking and, with boyish good nature offered half
his (<font color='blue'><b>lad</b></font>) paper, saying bluntly, <div class="bookquote">``want to read it? That's a first-rate story.''

 (<font color='red'><b>the lad</b></font>)</div><p/>Jo accepted it with a smile, for she (<font color='blue'><b>Jo</b></font>) had never outgrown her (<font color='blue'><b>Jo</b></font>) liking for
lads, and soon found herself involved in the usual labyrinth of love,
mystery, and murder, for the story belonged to that class of light
literature in which the passions have a holiday, and when the author's
invention fails, a grand catastrophe clears the stage of one half the
dramatis personae, leaving the other half to exult over their downfall.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Prime, isn't it?''  (<font color='red'><b>the boy</b></font>)</div>asked the boy, as her (<font color='blue'><b>Jo</b></font>) eye went down the last
paragraph of her (<font color='blue'><b>Jo</b></font>) portion.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``I think you and I could do as well as that if we tried,''  (<font color='red'><b>Jo/Miss Jo/JO</b></font>)</div>returned Jo,
amused at his (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>) admiration of the trash.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``I should think I was a pretty lucky chap if I could. She (<font color='blue'><b>Jo</b></font>) makes a good
living out of such stories, they say.''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>and he (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>) pointed to the name of
Mrs. S.L.A.N.G. Northbury, under the title of the tale.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Do you know her (<font color='blue'><b>Jo</b></font>)?''  (<font color='red'><b>Jo/Miss Jo/JO</b></font>)</div>asked Jo, with sudden interest.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``No, but I read all her (<font color='blue'><b>Jo</b></font>) pieces, and I know a fellow who works in the
office where this paper is printed.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Do you say she (<font color='blue'><b>Jo</b></font>) makes a good living out of stories like this?''  (<font color='red'><b>Jo/Miss Jo/JO</b></font>)</div>and Jo
looked more respectfully at the agitated group and thickly sprinkled
exclamation points that adorned the page.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Guess she (<font color='blue'><b>Jo</b></font>) does! She (<font color='blue'><b>Jo</b></font>) knows just what folks like, and gets paid well
for writing it.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Jo/Miss Jo/JO</b></font>)</div><p/>Here the lecture began, but Jo heard very little of it, for while
Professor Sands was prosing away about Belzoni, Cheops, scarabei, and
hieroglyphics, she (<font color='blue'><b>Jo</b></font>) was covertly taking down the address of the paper,
and boldly resolving to try for the hundred-dollar prize offered in its
columns for a sensational story. By the time the lecture ended and the
audience awoke, she (<font color='blue'><b>Jo</b></font>) had built up a splendid fortune for herself -LRB-not
the first founded on paper-RRB-, and was already deep in the concoction of
her (<font color='blue'><b>Jo</b></font>) story, being unable to decide whether the duel should come before
the elopement or after the murder.

<p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>Jo</b></font>) said nothing of her (<font color='blue'><b>Jo</b></font>) plan at home, but fell to work next day, much
to the disquiet of her (<font color='blue'><b>Jo</b></font>) mother, who always looked a little anxious when
`genius took to burning'. Jo had never tried this style before,
contenting herself with very mild romances for _The Spread Eagle_. Her (<font color='blue'><b>Jo</b></font>)
experience and miscellaneous reading were of service now, for they gave
her (<font color='blue'><b>Jo</b></font>) some idea of dramatic effect, and supplied plot, language, and
costumes. Her (<font color='blue'><b>Jo</b></font>) story was as full of desperation and despair as her (<font color='blue'><b>Jo</b></font>)
limited acquaintance with those uncomfortable emotions enabled her (<font color='blue'><b>Jo</b></font>) to
make it, and having located it in Lisbon, she (<font color='blue'><b>Jo</b></font>) wound up with an
earthquake, as a striking and appropriate denouement. The manuscript
was privately dispatched, accompanied by a note, modestly saying that
if the tale didn't get the prize, which the writer hardly dared expect,
she (<font color='blue'><b>Jo</b></font>) would be very glad to receive any sum it might be considered worth.

<p/>Six weeks is a long time to wait, and a still longer time for a girl to
keep a secret, but Jo did both, and was just beginning to give up all
hope of ever seeing her (<font color='blue'><b>Jo</b></font>) manuscript again, when a letter arrived which
almost took her (<font color='blue'><b>Jo</b></font>) breath away, for on opening it, a check for a hundred
dollars fell into her (<font color='blue'><b>Jo</b></font>) lap. For a minute she (<font color='blue'><b>Jo</b></font>) stared at it as if it had
been a snake, then she (<font color='blue'><b>Jo</b></font>) read her (<font color='blue'><b>Jo</b></font>) letter and began to cry. If the
amiable gentleman who wrote that kindly note could have known what
intense happiness he (<font color='blue'><b>gentleman</b></font>) was giving a fellow creature, I think he (<font color='blue'><b>gentleman</b></font>) would
devote his (<font color='blue'><b>gentleman</b></font>) leisure hours, if he (<font color='blue'><b>gentleman</b></font>) has any, to that amusement, for Jo
valued the letter more than the money, because it was encouraging, and
after years of effort it was so pleasant to find that she (<font color='blue'><b>Jo</b></font>) had learned
to do something, though it was only to write a sensation story.

<p/>A prouder young woman was seldom seen than she (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>), when, having composed
herself, she (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) electrified the family by appearing before them with the
letter in one hand, the check in the other, announcing that she (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) had won
the prize. Of course there was a great jubilee, and when the story
came everyone read and praised it, though after her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) father had told her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>)
that the language was good, the romance fresh and hearty, and the
tragedy quite thrilling, he (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) shook his (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) head, and said in his (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) unworldly
way...

<p/><div class="bookquote">``You can do better than this, Jo. Aim at the highest, and never mind
the money.''

 (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I think the money is the best part of it. What will you do with such
a fortune?''  (<font color='red'><b>Amy/Amy March</b></font>)</div>asked Amy, regarding the magic slip of paper with a
reverential eye.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Send Beth and Mother to the seaside for a month or two,''  (<font color='red'><b>Jo/Miss Jo/JO</b></font>)</div>answered Jo
promptly.

<p/>To the seaside they went, after much discussion, and though Beth didn't
come home as plump and rosy as could be desired, she (<font color='blue'><b>Beth</b></font>) was much better,
while Mrs. March declared she (<font color='blue'><b>Beth</b></font>) felt ten years younger. So Jo was
satisfied with the investment of her (<font color='blue'><b>Jo</b></font>) prize money, and fell to work with
a cheery spirit, bent on earning more of those delightful checks. She (<font color='blue'><b>Jo</b></font>)
did earn several that year, and began to feel herself a power in the
house, for by the magic of a pen, her (<font color='blue'><b>Jo</b></font>) `rubbish' turned into comforts
for them all. The Duke's Daughter paid the butcher's bill, A Phantom
Hand put down a new carpet, and the Curse of the Coventrys proved the
blessing of the Marches in the way of groceries and gowns.

<p/>Wealth is certainly a most desirable thing, but poverty has its sunny
side, and one of the sweet uses of adversity is the genuine
satisfaction which comes from hearty work of head or hand, and to the
inspiration of necessity, we owe half the wise, beautiful, and useful
blessings of the world. Jo enjoyed a taste of this satisfaction, and
ceased to envy richer girls, taking great comfort in the knowledge that
she (<font color='blue'><b>Jo</b></font>) could supply her (<font color='blue'><b>Jo</b></font>) own wants, and need ask no one for a penny.

<p/>Little notice was taken of her (<font color='blue'><b>Jo</b></font>) stories, but they found a market, and
encouraged by this fact, she (<font color='blue'><b>Jo</b></font>) resolved to make a bold stroke for fame
and fortune. Having copied her (<font color='blue'><b>Jo</b></font>) novel for the fourth time, read it to
all her (<font color='blue'><b>Jo</b></font>) confidential friends, and submitted it with fear and trembling
to three publishers, she (<font color='blue'><b>Jo</b></font>) at last disposed of it, on condition that she (<font color='blue'><b>Jo</b></font>)
would cut it down one third, and omit all the parts which she (<font color='blue'><b>Jo</b></font>)
particularly admired.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Now I must either bundle it back in to my tin kitchen to mold, pay for
printing it myself, or chop it up to suit purchasers and get what I can
for it. Fame is a very good thing to have in the house, but cash is
more convenient, so I wish to take the sense of the meeting on this
important subject,''  (<font color='red'><b>Jo/Miss Jo/JO</b></font>)</div>said Jo, calling a family council.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Don't spoil your book, my girl, for there is more in it than you know,
and the idea is well worked out. Let it wait and ripen,''  (<font color='red'><b>father</b></font>)</div>was her (<font color='blue'><b>Jo</b></font>)
father's advice, and he (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) practiced what he (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) preached, having waited
patiently thirty years for fruit of his (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) own to ripen, and being in no
haste to gather it even now when it was sweet and mellow.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``It seems to me that Jo will profit more by taking the trial than by
waiting,''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>said Mrs. March. <div class="bookquote">``Criticism is the best test of such work,
for it will show her (<font color='blue'><b>Jo</b></font>) both unsuspected merits and faults, and help her (<font color='blue'><b>Jo</b></font>)
to do better next time. We are too partial, but the praise and blame
of outsiders will prove useful, even if she (<font color='blue'><b>Jo</b></font>) gets but little money.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Yes,''  (<font color='red'><b>Jo/Miss Jo/JO</b></font>)</div>said Jo, knitting her (<font color='blue'><b>Jo</b></font>) brows, <div class="bookquote">``that's just it. I've been fussing
over the thing so long, I really don't know whether it's good, bad, or
indifferent. It will be a great help to have cool, impartial persons
take a look at it, and tell me what they think of it.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Jo/Miss Jo/JO</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I wouldn't leave a word out of it. You'll spoil it if you do, for the
interest of the story is more in the minds than in the actions of the
people, and it will be all a muddle if you don't explain as you go on,''
 (<font color='red'><b>Meg</b></font>)</div>said Meg, who firmly believed that this book was the most remarkable
novel ever written.

<p/>``But Mr. Allen says, <div class="bookquote">``Leave out the explanations, make it brief and
dramatic, and let the characters tell the story',''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>interrupted Jo,
turning to the publisher's note.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Do as he (<font color='blue'><b>Allen</b></font>) tells you. He (<font color='blue'><b>Allen</b></font>) knows what will sell, and we don't. Make a
good, popular book, and get as much money as you can. By-and-by, when
you've got a name, you can afford to digress, and have philosophical
and metaphysical people in your novels,''  (<font color='red'><b>Amy/Amy March</b></font>)</div>said Amy, who took a strictly
practical view of the subject.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Well,''  (<font color='red'><b>Jo/Miss Jo/JO</b></font>)</div>said Jo, laughing, <div class="bookquote">``if my people are `philosophical and
metaphysical', it isn't my fault, for I know nothing about such things,
except what I hear father say, sometimes. If I've got some of his (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) wise
ideas jumbled up with my romance, so much the better for me. Now,
Beth, what do you say?''

 (<font color='red'><b>Jo/Miss Jo/JO</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I should so like to see it printed soon,''  (<font color='red'><b>Beth</b></font>)</div>was all Beth said, and
smiled in saying it. But there was an unconscious emphasis on the last
word, and a wistful look in the eyes that never lost their childlike
candor, which chilled Jo's heart for a minute with a forboding fear,
and decided her (<font color='blue'><b>Jo</b></font>) to make her (<font color='blue'><b>Jo</b></font>) little venture `soon'.

<p/>So, with Spartan firmness, the young authoress laid her (<font color='blue'><b>Jo</b></font>) first-born on
her (<font color='blue'><b>Jo</b></font>) table, and chopped it up as ruthlessly as any ogre. In the hope of
pleasing everyone, she (<font color='blue'><b>Jo</b></font>) took everyone's advice, and like the old man and
his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) donkey in the fable suited nobody.

<p/>Her (<font color='blue'><b>Jo</b></font>) father liked the metaphysical streak which had unconsciously got
into it, so that was allowed to remain though she (<font color='blue'><b>Jo</b></font>) had her (<font color='blue'><b>Jo</b></font>) doubts about
it. Her (<font color='blue'><b>Jo</b></font>) mother thought that there was a trifle too much description.
Out, therefore it came, and with it many necessary links in the story.
Meg admired the tragedy, so Jo piled up the agony to suit her (<font color='blue'><b>Jo</b></font>), while
Amy objected to the fun, and, with the best intentions in life, Jo
quenched the spritly scenes which relieved the somber character of the
story. Then, to complicate the ruin, she (<font color='blue'><b>Jo</b></font>) cut it down one third, and
confidingly sent the poor little romance, like a picked robin, out into
the big, busy world to try its fate.

<p/>Well, it was printed, and she (<font color='blue'><b>Jo</b></font>) got three hundred dollars for it,
likewise plenty of praise and blame, both so much greater than she (<font color='blue'><b>Jo</b></font>)
expected that she (<font color='blue'><b>Jo</b></font>) was thrown into a state of bewilderment from which it
took her (<font color='blue'><b>Jo</b></font>) some time to recover.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``You said, Mother, that criticism would help me. But how can it, when
it's so contradictory that I don't know whether I've written a
promising book or broken all the ten commandments?''  (<font color='red'><b>Jo/Miss Jo/JO</b></font>)</div>cried poor Jo,
turning over a heap of notices, the perusal of which filled her (<font color='blue'><b>Jo</b></font>) with
pride and joy one minute, wrath and dismay the next. ``This man says,
``An exquisite book, full of truth, beauty, and earnestness.'' ``All is
sweet, pure, and healthy.''' continued the perplexed authoress. ``The
next, <div class="bookquote">``The theory of the book is bad, full of morbid fancies,
spiritualistic ideas, and unnatural characters.''  (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div>Now, as I had no
theory of any kind, don't believe in Spiritualism, and copied my
characters from life, I don't see how this critic can be right.
Another says, <div class="bookquote">``It's one of the best American novels which has appeared
for years.''  (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div>-LRB-I know better than that-RRB-, and the next asserts that
<div class="bookquote">``Though it is original, and written with great force and feeling, it is
a dangerous book.''  (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``Tisn't! Some make fun of it, some overpraise, and
nearly all insist that I had a deep theory to expound, when I only
wrote it for the pleasure and the money. I wish I'd printed the whole
or not at all, for I do hate to be so misjudged.''

 (<font color='red'><b>family comfort commendation</b></font>)</div><p/>Her (<font color='blue'><b>Jo</b></font>) family and friends administered comfort and commendation liberally.
Yet it was a hard time for sensitive, high-spirited Jo, who meant so
well and had apparently done so ill. But it did her (<font color='blue'><b>Jo</b></font>) good, for those
whose opinion had real value gave her (<font color='blue'><b>Jo</b></font>) the criticism which is an
author's best education, and when the first soreness was over, she (<font color='blue'><b>Jo</b></font>)
could laugh at her (<font color='blue'><b>Jo</b></font>) poor little book, yet believe in it still, and feel
herself the wiser and stronger for the buffeting she (<font color='blue'><b>Jo</b></font>) had received.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Not being a genius, like Keats, it won't kill me,''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Jo</b></font>) said stoutly,
<div class="bookquote">``and I've got the joke on my side, after all, for the parts that were
taken straight out of real life are denounced as impossible and absurd,
and the scenes that I made up out of my own silly head are pronounced
`charmingly natural, tender, and true'. So I'll comfort myself with
that, and when I'm ready, I'll up again and take another.''



 (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div><p/>CHAPTER TWENTY-EIGHT

<p/>DOMESTIC EXPERIENCES

<p/>Like most other young matrons, Meg began her (<font color='blue'><b>Meg</b></font>) married life with the
determination to be a model housekeeper. John should find home a
paradise, he (<font color='blue'><b>author</b></font>) should always see a smiling face, should fare sumptuously
every day, and never know the loss of a button. She (<font color='blue'><b>John</b></font>) brought so much
love, energy, and cheerfulness to the work that she (<font color='blue'><b>John</b></font>) could not but
succeed, in spite of some obstacles. Her (<font color='blue'><b>John</b></font>) paradise was not a tranquil
one, for the little woman fussed, was over-anxious to please, and
bustled about like a true Martha, cumbered with many cares. She (<font color='blue'><b>Martha</b></font>) was
too tired, sometimes, even to smile, John grew dyspeptic after a course
of dainty dishes and ungratefully demanded plain fare. As for buttons,
she (<font color='blue'><b>John</b></font>) soon learned to wonder where they went, to shake her (<font color='blue'><b>John</b></font>) head over the
carelessness of men, and to threaten to make him (<font color='blue'><b>Martha</b></font>) sew them on himself,
and see if his (<font color='blue'><b>Martha</b></font>) work would stand impatient and clumsy fingers any better
than hers.

<p/>They were very happy, even after they discovered that they couldn't
live on love alone. John did not find Meg's beauty diminished, though
she (<font color='blue'><b>John</b></font>) beamed at him (<font color='blue'><b>Martha</b></font>) from behind the familiar coffee pot. Nor did Meg
miss any of the romance from the daily parting, when her (<font color='blue'><b>Meg</b></font>) husband
followed up his (<font color='blue'><b>husband</b></font>) kiss with the tender inquiry, <div class="bookquote">``Shall I send some veal
or mutton for dinner, darling?''  (<font color='red'><b>husband</b></font>)</div>The little house ceased to be a
glorified bower, but it became a home, and the young couple soon felt
that it was a change for the better. At first they played keep-house,
and frolicked over it like children. Then John took steadily to
business, feeling the cares of the head of a family upon his (<font color='blue'><b>husband</b></font>) shoulders,
and Meg laid by her (<font color='blue'><b>Meg</b></font>) cambric wrappers, put on a big apron, and fell to
work, as before said, with more energy than discretion.

<p/>While the cooking mania lasted she (<font color='blue'><b>Meg</b></font>) went through Mrs. Cornelius's
Receipt Book as if it were a mathematical exercise, working out the
problems with patience and care. Sometimes her (<font color='blue'><b>Meg</b></font>) family were invited in
to help eat up a too bounteous feast of successes, or Lotty would be
privately dispatched with a batch of failures, which were to be
concealed from all eyes in the convenient stomachs of the little
Hummels. An evening with John over the account books usually produced
a temporary lull in the culinary enthusiasm, and a frugal fit would
ensue, during which the poor man was put through a course of bread
pudding, hash, and warmed-over coffee, which tried his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) soul, although
he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) bore it with praiseworthy fortitude. Before the golden mean was
found, however, Meg added to her (<font color='blue'><b>Meg</b></font>) domestic possessions what young
couples seldom get on long without, a family jar.

<p/>Fired with a housewifely wish to see her (<font color='blue'><b>Meg</b></font>) storeroom stocked with
homemade preserves, she (<font color='blue'><b>Meg</b></font>) undertook to put up her (<font color='blue'><b>Meg</b></font>) own currant jelly. John
was requested to order home a dozen or so of little pots and an extra
quantity of sugar, for their own currants were ripe and were to be
attended to at once. As John firmly believed that `my wife' was equal
to anything, and took a natural pride in her (<font color='blue'><b>John</b></font>) skill, he (<font color='blue'><b>Meg</b></font>) resolved that
she (<font color='blue'><b>John</b></font>) should be gratified, and their only crop of fruit laid by in a most
pleasing form for winter use. Home came four dozen delightful little
pots, half a barrel of sugar, and a small boy to pick the currants for
her (<font color='blue'><b>John</b></font>). With her (<font color='blue'><b>John</b></font>) pretty hair tucked into a little cap, arms bared to the
elbow, and a checked apron which had a coquettish look in spite of the
bib, the young housewife fell to work, feeling no doubts about her (<font color='blue'><b>housewife</b></font>)
success, for hadn't she (<font color='blue'><b>housewife</b></font>) seen Hannah do it hundreds of times? The array
of pots rather amazed her (<font color='blue'><b>Hannah</b></font>) at first, but John was so fond of jelly, and
the nice little jars would look so well on the top shelf, that Meg
resolved to fill them all, and spent a long day picking, boiling,
straining, and fussing over her (<font color='blue'><b>Meg</b></font>) jelly. She (<font color='blue'><b>Meg</b></font>) did her (<font color='blue'><b>Meg</b></font>) best, she (<font color='blue'><b>Meg</b></font>) asked
advice of Mrs. Cornelius, she (<font color='blue'><b>Cornelius</b></font>) racked her (<font color='blue'><b>Cornelius</b></font>) brain to remember what Hannah
did that she (<font color='blue'><b>Hannah</b></font>) left undone, she (<font color='blue'><b>Hannah</b></font>) reboiled, resugared, and restrained, but
that dreadful stuff wouldn't `jell'.

<p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>Hannah</b></font>) longed to run home, bib and all, and ask Mother to lend her (<font color='blue'><b>Hannah</b></font>) a hand,
but John and she (<font color='blue'><b>John</b></font>) had agreed that they would never annoy anyone with
their private worries, experiments, or quarrels. They had laughed over
that last word as if the idea it suggested was a most preposterous one,
but they had held to their resolve, and whenever they could get on
without help they did so, and no one interfered, for Mrs. March had
advised the plan. So Meg wrestled alone with the refractory sweetmeats
all that hot summer day, and at five o'clock sat down in her (<font color='blue'><b>Meg</b></font>)
topsy-turvey kitchen, wrung her (<font color='blue'><b>Meg</b></font>) bedaubed hands, lifted up her (<font color='blue'><b>Meg</b></font>) voice and
wept.

<p/>Now, in the first flush of the new life, she (<font color='blue'><b>Meg</b></font>) had often said, <div class="bookquote">``My
husband shall always feel free to bring a friend home whenever he (<font color='blue'><b>friend</b></font>)
likes. I shall always be prepared. There shall be no flurry, no
scolding, no discomfort, but a neat house, a cheerful wife, and a good
dinner. John, dear, never stop to ask my leave, invite whom you
please, and be sure of a welcome from me.''

 (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div><p/>How charming that was, to be sure! John quite glowed with pride to
hear her (<font color='blue'><b>John</b></font>) say it, and felt what a blessed thing it was to have a
superior wife. But, although they had had company from time to time,
it never happened to be unexpected, and Meg had never had an
opportunity to distinguish herself till now. It always happens so in
this vale of tears, there is an inevitability about such things which
we can only wonder at, deplore, and bear as we best can.

<p/>If John had not forgotten all about the jelly, it really would have
been unpardonable in him (<font color='blue'><b>they</b></font>) to choose that day, of all the days in the
year, to bring a friend home to dinner unexpectedly. Congratulating
himself that a handsome repast had been ordered that morning, feeling
sure that it would be ready to the minute, and indulging in pleasant
anticipations of the charming effect it would produce, when his (<font color='blue'><b>friend</b></font>) pretty
wife came running out to meet him (<font color='blue'><b>friend</b></font>), he (<font color='blue'><b>friend</b></font>) escorted his (<font color='blue'><b>friend</b></font>) friend to his (<font color='blue'><b>friend</b></font>)
mansion, with the irrepressible satisfaction of a young host and
husband.

<p/>It is a world of disappointments, as John discovered when he (<font color='blue'><b>friend</b></font>) reached
the Dovecote. The front door usually stood hospitably open. Now it was
not only shut, but locked, and yesterday's mud still adorned the steps.
The parlor windows were closed and curtained, no picture of the pretty
wife sewing on the piazza, in white, with a distracting little bow in
her (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>) hair, or a bright-eyed hostess, smiling a shy welcome as she (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>)
greeted her (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>) guest. Nothing of the sort, for not a soul appeared but a
sanginary-looking boy asleep under the current bushes.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``I'm afraid something has happened. Step into the garden, Scott, while
I look up Mrs. Brooke,''  (<font color='red'><b>John/Mrs. Brooke/John Brooke</b></font>)</div>said John, alarmed at the silence and solitude.

<p/>Round the house he (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>) hurried, led by a pungent smell of burned sugar, and
Mr. Scott strolled after him (<font color='blue'><b>Scott</b></font>), with a queer look on his (<font color='blue'><b>Scott</b></font>) face. He (<font color='blue'><b>Scott</b></font>) paused
discreetly at a distance when Brooke disappeared, but he (<font color='blue'><b>Brooke</b></font>) could both see
and hear, and being a bachelor, enjoyed the prospect mightily.

<p/>In the kitchen reigned confusion and despair. One edition of jelly was
trickled from pot to pot, another lay upon the floor, and a third was
burning gaily on the stove. Lotty, with Teutonic phlegm, was calmly
eating bread and currant wine, for the jelly was still in a hopelessly
liquid state, while Mrs. Brooke, with her (<font color='blue'><b>Brooke</b></font>) apron over her (<font color='blue'><b>Brooke</b></font>) head, sat
sobbing dismally.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``My dearest girl, what is the matter?''  (<font color='red'><b>John/Mrs. Brooke/John Brooke</b></font>)</div>cried John, rushing in, with
awful visions of scalded hands, sudden news of affliction, and secret
consternation at the thought of the guest in the garden.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Oh, John, I am so tired and hot and cross and worried! I've been at
it till I'm all worn out. Do come and help me or I shall die!''  (<font color='red'><b>the housewife</b></font>)</div>and the
exhausted housewife cast herself upon his (<font color='blue'><b>guest</b></font>) breast, giving him (<font color='blue'><b>guest</b></font>) a sweet
welcome in every sense of the word, for her (<font color='blue'><b>housewife</b></font>) pinafore had been baptized
at the same time as the floor.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``What worries you dear? Has anything dreadful happened?''  (<font color='red'><b>John/Mrs. Brooke/John Brooke</b></font>)</div>asked the
anxious John, tenderly kissing the crown of the little cap, which was
all askew.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Yes,''  (<font color='red'><b>Meg</b></font>)</div>sobbed Meg despairingly.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Tell me quick, then. Don't cry. I can bear anything better than
that. Out with it, love.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``The... The jelly won't jell and I don't know what to do!''

 (<font color='red'><b>John/Mrs. Brooke/John Brooke</b></font>)</div><p/>John Brooke laughed then as he (<font color='blue'><b>guest</b></font>) never dared to laugh afterward, and the
derisive Scott smiled involuntarily as he (<font color='blue'><b>guest</b></font>) heard the hearty peal, which
put the finishing stroke to poor Meg's woe.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Is that all? Fling it out of the window, and don't bother any more
about it. I'll buy you quarts if you want it, but for heaven's sake
don't have hysterics, for I've brought Jack Scott home to dinner,
and...''

 (<font color='red'><b>John/Mrs. Brooke/John Brooke</b></font>)</div><p/>John got no further, for Meg cast him (<font color='blue'><b>guest</b></font>) off, and clasped her (<font color='blue'><b>John</b></font>) hands with a
tragic gesture as she (<font color='blue'><b>John</b></font>) fell into a chair, exclaiming in a tone of
mingled indignation, reproach, and dismay...

<p/><div class="bookquote">``A man to dinner, and everything in a mess! John Brooke, how could you
do such a thing?''

 (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Hush, he (<font color='blue'><b>Scott</b></font>)'s in the garden! I forgot the confounded jelly, but it can't
be helped now,''  (<font color='red'><b>John/Mrs. Brooke/John Brooke</b></font>)</div>said John, surveying the prospect with an anxious eye.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``You ought to have sent word, or told me this morning, and you ought to
have remembered how busy I was,''  (<font color='red'><b>Meg</b></font>)</div>continued Meg petulantly, for even
turtledoves will peck when ruffled.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``I didn't know it this morning, and there was no time to send word, for
I met him (<font color='blue'><b>Scott</b></font>) on the way out. I never thought of asking leave, when you
have always told me to do as I liked. I never tried it before, and
hang me if I ever do again!''  (<font color='red'><b>John/Mrs. Brooke/John Brooke</b></font>)</div>added John, with an aggrieved air.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``I should hope not! Take him (<font color='blue'><b>Scott</b></font>) away at once. I can't see him (<font color='blue'><b>Scott</b></font>), and there
isn't any dinner.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Well, I like that! Where's the beef and vegetables I sent home, and
the pudding you promised?''  (<font color='red'><b>John/Mrs. Brooke/John Brooke</b></font>)</div>cried John, rushing to the larder.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``I hadn't time to cook anything. I meant to dine at Mother's. I'm
sorry, but I was so busy,''  (<font color='red'><b>Meg</b></font>)</div>and Meg's tears began again.

<p/>John was a mild man, but he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) was human, and after a long day's work to
come home tired, hungry, and hopeful, to find a chaotic house, an empty
table, and a cross wife was not exactly conducive to repose of mind or
manner. He (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) restrained himself however, and the little squall would
have blown over, but for one unlucky word.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``It's a scrape, I acknowledge, but if you will lend a hand, we'll pull
through and have a good time yet. Don't cry, dear, but just exert
yourself a bit, and fix us up something to eat. We're both as hungry
as hunters, so we shan't mind what it is. Give us the cold meat, and
bread and cheese. We won't ask for jelly.''

 (<font color='red'><b>He</b></font>)</div><p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) meant it to be a good-natured joke, but that one word sealed his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>)
fate. Meg thought it was too cruel to hint about her (<font color='blue'><b>Meg</b></font>) sad failure, and
the last atom of patience vanished as he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) spoke.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``You must get yourself out of the scrape as you can. I'm too used up
to `exert' myself for anyone. It's like a man to propose a bone and
vulgar bread and cheese for company. I won't have anything of the sort
in my house. Take that Scott up to Mother's, and tell him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) I'm away,
sick, dead, anything. I won't see him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>), and you two can laugh at me and
my jelly as much as you like. You won't have anything else here.''  (<font color='red'><b>Meg</b></font>)</div>and
having delivered her (<font color='blue'><b>Meg</b></font>) defiance all on one breath, Meg cast away her (<font color='blue'><b>Meg</b></font>)
pinafore and precipitately left the field to bemoan herself in her (<font color='blue'><b>Meg</b></font>) own
room.

<p/>What those two creatures did in her (<font color='blue'><b>Meg</b></font>) absence, she (<font color='blue'><b>Meg</b></font>) never knew, but Mr.
Scott was not taken `up to Mother's', and when Meg descended, after
they had strolled away together, she (<font color='blue'><b>Meg</b></font>) found traces of a promiscuous
lunch which filled her (<font color='blue'><b>Meg</b></font>) with horror. Lotty reported that they had eaten
<div class="bookquote">``a much, and greatly laughed, and the master bid her (<font color='blue'><b>Mother</b></font>) throw away all the
sweet stuff, and hide the pots.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Lotty</b></font>)</div><p/>Meg longed to go and tell Mother, but a sense of shame at her (<font color='blue'><b>Meg</b></font>) own
short-comings, of loyalty to John, <div class="bookquote">``who might be cruel, but nobody
should know it,''  (<font color='red'><b>John/Mrs. Brooke/John Brooke</b></font>)</div>restrained her (<font color='blue'><b>John</b></font>), and after a summary cleaning up, she (<font color='blue'><b>John</b></font>)
dressed herself prettily, and sat down to wait for John to come and be
forgiven.

<p/>Unfortunately, John didn't come, not seeing the matter in that light.
He (<font color='blue'><b>Meg</b></font>) had carried it off as a good joke with Scott, excused his (<font color='blue'><b>Meg</b></font>) little
wife as well as he (<font color='blue'><b>Meg</b></font>) could, and played the host so hospitably that his (<font color='blue'><b>Meg</b></font>)
friend enjoyed the impromptu dinner, and promised to come again, but
John was angry, though he (<font color='blue'><b>Meg</b></font>) did not show it, he (<font color='blue'><b>Meg</b></font>) felt that Meg had
deserted him (<font color='blue'><b>Meg</b></font>) in his (<font color='blue'><b>Meg</b></font>) hour of need. <div class="bookquote">``It wasn't fair to tell a man to
bring folks home any time, with perfect freedom, and when he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) took you
at your word, to flame up and blame him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>), and leave him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) in the lurch, to
be laughed at or pitied. No, by George, it wasn't! And Meg must know
it.''

 (<font color='red'><b>He</b></font>)</div><p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Meg</b></font>) had fumed inwardly during the feast, but when the flurry was over
and he (<font color='blue'><b>Meg</b></font>) strolled home after seeing Scott off, a milder mood came over
him (<font color='blue'><b>Meg</b></font>). <div class="bookquote">``Poor little thing! It was hard upon her (<font color='blue'><b>Meg</b></font>) when she (<font color='blue'><b>Meg</b></font>) tried so
heartily to please me. She (<font color='blue'><b>Meg</b></font>) was wrong, of course, but then she (<font color='blue'><b>Meg</b></font>) was
young. I must be patient and teach her (<font color='blue'><b>Meg</b></font>).''  (<font color='red'><b>He</b></font>)</div>He (<font color='blue'><b>Meg</b></font>) hoped she (<font color='blue'><b>Scott</b></font>) had not gone
home--he (<font color='blue'><b>Meg</b></font>) hated gossip and interference. For a minute he (<font color='blue'><b>Meg</b></font>) was ruffled
again at the mere thought of it, and then the fear that Meg would cry
herself sick softened his (<font color='blue'><b>Meg</b></font>) heart, and sent him (<font color='blue'><b>Meg</b></font>) on at a quicker pace,
resolving to be calm and kind, but firm, quite firm, and show her (<font color='blue'><b>Meg</b></font>) where
she (<font color='blue'><b>Meg</b></font>) had failed in her (<font color='blue'><b>Meg</b></font>) duty to her (<font color='blue'><b>Meg</b></font>) spouse.

<p/>Meg likewise resolved to be `calm and kind, but firm', and show him (<font color='blue'><b>Meg</b></font>) his (<font color='blue'><b>Meg</b></font>)
duty. She (<font color='blue'><b>Meg</b></font>) longed to run to meet him (<font color='blue'><b>Meg</b></font>), and beg pardon, and be kissed and
comforted, as she (<font color='blue'><b>Meg</b></font>) was sure of being, but, of course, she (<font color='blue'><b>Meg</b></font>) did nothing of
the sort, and when she (<font color='blue'><b>Meg</b></font>) saw John coming, began to hum quite naturally,
as she (<font color='blue'><b>John</b></font>) rocked and sewed, like a lady of leisure in her (<font color='blue'><b>John</b></font>) best parlor.

<p/>John was a little disappointed not to find a tender Niobe, but feeling
that his (<font color='blue'><b>Meg</b></font>) dignity demanded the first apology, he (<font color='blue'><b>Meg</b></font>) made none, only came
leisurely in and laid himself upon the sofa with the singularly
relevant remark, <div class="bookquote">``We are going to have a new moon, my dear.''

 (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I've no objection,''  (<font color='red'><b>Meg</b></font>)</div>was Meg's equally soothing remark. A few other
topics of general interest were introduced by Mr. Brooke and
wet-blanketed by Mrs. Brooke, and conversation languished. John went
to one window, unfolded his (<font color='blue'><b>Brooke</b></font>) paper, and wrapped himself in it,
figuratively speaking. Meg went to the other window, and sewed as if
new rosettes for slippers were among the necessaries of life. Neither
spoke. Both looked quite `calm and firm', and both felt desperately
uncomfortable.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Oh, dear,''  (<font color='red'><b>Meg</b></font>)</div>thought Meg, <div class="bookquote">``married life is very trying, and does need
infinite patience as well as love, as Mother says.''  (<font color='red'><b>Meg</b></font>)</div>The word ``Mother'
suggested other maternal counsels given long ago, and received with
unbelieving protests.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``John is a good man, but he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) has his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) faults, and you must learn to see
and bear with them, remembering your own. He (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) is very decided, but
never will be obstinate, if you reason kindly, not oppose impatiently.
He (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) is very accurate, and particular about the truth--a good trait,
though you call him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) `fussy'. Never deceive him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) by look or word, Meg,
and he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) will give you the confidence you deserve, the support you need.
He (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) has a temper, not like ours--one flash and then all over--but the
white, still anger that is seldom stirred, but once kindled is hard to
quench. Be careful, be very careful, not to wake his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) anger against
yourself, for peace and happiness depend on keeping his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) respect. Watch
yourself, be the first to ask pardon if you both err, and guard against
the little piques, misunderstandings, and hasty words that often pave
the way for bitter sorrow and regret.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Meg</b></font>)</div><p/>These words came back to Meg, as she (<font color='blue'><b>Meg</b></font>) sat sewing in the sunset,
especially the last. This was the first serious disagreement, her (<font color='blue'><b>Meg</b></font>) own
hasty speeches sounded both silly and unkind, as she (<font color='blue'><b>Meg</b></font>) recalled them, her (<font color='blue'><b>Meg</b></font>)
own anger looked childish now, and thoughts of poor John coming home to
such a scene quite melted her (<font color='blue'><b>John</b></font>) heart. She (<font color='blue'><b>John</b></font>) glanced at him (<font color='blue'><b>Meg</b></font>) with tears in
her (<font color='blue'><b>John</b></font>) eyes, but he (<font color='blue'><b>Meg</b></font>) did not see them. She (<font color='blue'><b>John</b></font>) put down her (<font color='blue'><b>John</b></font>) work and got up,
thinking, ``I will be the first to say, ``Forgive me''', but he (<font color='blue'><b>Meg</b></font>) did not
seem to hear her (<font color='blue'><b>John</b></font>). She (<font color='blue'><b>John</b></font>) went very slowly across the room, for pride was
hard to swallow, and stood by him (<font color='blue'><b>Meg</b></font>), but he (<font color='blue'><b>Meg</b></font>) did not turn his (<font color='blue'><b>Meg</b></font>) head. For a
minute she (<font color='blue'><b>John</b></font>) felt as if she (<font color='blue'><b>John</b></font>) really couldn't do it, then came the thought,
<div class="bookquote">``This is the beginning. I'll do my part, and have nothing to reproach
myself with,''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>and stooping down, she (<font color='blue'><b>John</b></font>) softly kissed her (<font color='blue'><b>John</b></font>) husband on the
forehead. Of course that settled it. The penitent kiss was better than
a world of words, and John had her (<font color='blue'><b>John</b></font>) on his (<font color='blue'><b>husband</b></font>) knee in a minute, saying
tenderly...

<p/><div class="bookquote">``It was too bad to laugh at the poor little jelly pots. Forgive me,
dear. I never will again!''

 (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div><p/>But he (<font color='blue'><b>husband</b></font>) did, oh bless you, yes, hundreds of times, and so did Meg, both
declaring that it was the sweetest jelly they ever made, for family
peace was preserved in that little family jar.

<p/>After this, Meg had Mr. Scott to dinner by special invitation, and
served him (<font color='blue'><b>Scott</b></font>) up a pleasant feast without a cooked wife for the first
course, on which occasion she (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>) was so gay and gracious, and made
everything go off so charmingly, that Mr. Scott told John he (<font color='blue'><b>Scott</b></font>) was a
lucky fellow, and shook his (<font color='blue'><b>Scott</b></font>) head over the hardships of bachelorhood all
the way home.

<p/>In the autumn, new trials and experiences came to Meg. Sallie Moffat
renewed her (<font color='blue'><b>Meg</b></font>) friendship, was always running out for a dish of gossip at
the little house, or inviting `that poor dear' to come in and spend the
day at the big house. It was pleasant, for in dull weather Meg often
felt lonely. All were busy at home, John absent till night, and
nothing to do but sew, or read, or potter about. So it naturally fell
out that Meg got into the way of gadding and gossiping with her (<font color='blue'><b>Meg</b></font>) friend.
Seeing Sallie's pretty things made her (<font color='blue'><b>Meg</b></font>) long for such, and pity herself
because she (<font color='blue'><b>Meg</b></font>) had not got them. Sallie was very kind, and often offered
her (<font color='blue'><b>Sallie</b></font>) the coveted trifles, but Meg declined them, knowing that John
wouldn't like it, and then this foolish little woman went and did what
John disliked even worse.

<p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>John</b></font>) knew her (<font color='blue'><b>John</b></font>) husband's income, and she (<font color='blue'><b>John</b></font>) loved to feel that he (<font color='blue'><b>husband</b></font>) trusted
her (<font color='blue'><b>John</b></font>), not only with his (<font color='blue'><b>husband</b></font>) happiness, but what some men seem to value
more--his (<font color='blue'><b>husband</b></font>) money. She (<font color='blue'><b>John</b></font>) knew where it was, was free to take what she (<font color='blue'><b>John</b></font>)
liked, and all he (<font color='blue'><b>husband</b></font>) asked was that she (<font color='blue'><b>John</b></font>) should keep account of every
penny, pay bills once a month, and remember that she (<font color='blue'><b>John</b></font>) was a poor man's
wife. Till now she (<font color='blue'><b>John</b></font>) had done well, been prudent and exact, kept her (<font color='blue'><b>John</b></font>)
little account books neatly, and showed them to him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) monthly without
fear. But that autumn the serpent got into Meg's paradise, and tempted
her (<font color='blue'><b>Meg</b></font>) like many a modern Eve, not with apples, but with dress. Meg
didn't like to be pitied and made to feel poor. It irritated her (<font color='blue'><b>Meg</b></font>), but
she (<font color='blue'><b>Meg</b></font>) was ashamed to confess it, and now and then she (<font color='blue'><b>Meg</b></font>) tried to console
herself by buying something pretty, so that Sallie needn't think she (<font color='blue'><b>Sallie</b></font>)
had to economize. She (<font color='blue'><b>Sallie</b></font>) always felt wicked after it, for the pretty
things were seldom necessaries, but then they cost so little, it wasn't
worth worrying about, so the trifles increased unconsciously, and in
the shopping excursions she (<font color='blue'><b>Sallie</b></font>) was no longer a passive looker-on.

<p/>But the trifles cost more than one would imagine, and when she (<font color='blue'><b>Sallie</b></font>) cast up
her (<font color='blue'><b>Sallie</b></font>) accounts at the end of the month the sum total rather scared her (<font color='blue'><b>Sallie</b></font>).
John was busy that month and left the bills to her (<font color='blue'><b>John</b></font>), the next month he (<font color='blue'><b>John</b></font>)
was absent, but the third he (<font color='blue'><b>John</b></font>) had a grand quarterly settling up, and Meg
never forgot it. A few days before she (<font color='blue'><b>Meg</b></font>) had done a dreadful thing, and
it weighed upon her (<font color='blue'><b>Meg</b></font>) conscience. Sallie had been buying silks, and Meg
longed for a new one, just a handsome light one for parties, her (<font color='blue'><b>Meg</b></font>) black
silk was so common, and thin things for evening wear were only proper
for girls. Aunt March usually gave the sisters a present of
twenty-five dollars apiece at New Year's. That was only a month to
wait, and here was a lovely violet silk going at a bargain, and she (<font color='blue'><b>Aunt</b></font>) had
the money, if she (<font color='blue'><b>Aunt</b></font>) only dared to take it. John always said what was his (<font color='blue'><b>Meg</b></font>)
was hers, but would he (<font color='blue'><b>Meg</b></font>) think it right to spend not only the prospective
five-and-twenty, but another five-and-twenty out of the household fund?
That was the question. Sallie had urged her (<font color='blue'><b>Sallie</b></font>) to do it, had offered to
lend the money, and with the best intentions in life had tempted Meg
beyond her (<font color='blue'><b>Meg</b></font>) strength. In an evil moment the shopman held up the lovely,
shimmering folds, and said, <div class="bookquote">``A bargain, I assure, you, ma'am.''  (<font color='red'><b>the shopman</b></font>)</div>She (<font color='blue'><b>Meg</b></font>)
answered, <div class="bookquote">``I'll take it,''  (<font color='red'><b>She</b></font>)</div>and it was cut off and paid for, and Sallie
had exulted, and she (<font color='blue'><b>Sallie</b></font>) had laughed as if it were a thing of no
consequence, and driven away, feeling as if she (<font color='blue'><b>Sallie</b></font>) had stolen something,
and the police were after her (<font color='blue'><b>Sallie</b></font>).

<p/>When she (<font color='blue'><b>Sallie</b></font>) got home, she (<font color='blue'><b>Sallie</b></font>) tried to assuage the pangs of remorse by
spreading forth the lovely silk, but it looked less silvery now, didn't
become her (<font color='blue'><b>Sallie</b></font>), after all, and the words `fifty dollars' seemed stamped
like a pattern down each breadth. She (<font color='blue'><b>Sallie</b></font>) put it away, but it haunted her (<font color='blue'><b>Sallie</b></font>),
not delightfully as a new dress should, but dreadfully like the ghost
of a folly that was not easily laid. When John got out his (<font color='blue'><b>Sallie</b></font>) books that
night, Meg's heart sank, and for the first time in her (<font color='blue'><b>Meg</b></font>) married life,
she (<font color='blue'><b>Meg</b></font>) was afraid of her (<font color='blue'><b>Meg</b></font>) husband. The kind, brown eyes looked as if they
could be stern, and though he (<font color='blue'><b>husband</b></font>) was unusually merry, she (<font color='blue'><b>Meg</b></font>) fancied he (<font color='blue'><b>husband</b></font>) had
found her (<font color='blue'><b>Meg</b></font>) out, but didn't mean to let her (<font color='blue'><b>Meg</b></font>) know it. The house bills
were all paid, the books all in order. John had praised her (<font color='blue'><b>John</b></font>), and was
undoing the old pocketbook which they called the `bank', when Meg,
knowing that it was quite empty, stopped his (<font color='blue'><b>husband</b></font>) hand, saying nervously...

<p/><div class="bookquote">``You haven't seen my private expense book yet.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Meg</b></font>)</div><p/>John never asked to see it, but she (<font color='blue'><b>John</b></font>) always insisted on his (<font color='blue'><b>husband</b></font>) doing so,
and used to enjoy his (<font color='blue'><b>husband</b></font>) masculine amazement at the queer things women
wanted, and made him (<font color='blue'><b>husband</b></font>) guess what piping was, demand fiercely the meaning
of a hug-me-tight, or wonder how a little thing composed of three
rosebuds, a bit of velvet, and a pair of strings, could possibly be a
bonnet, and cost six dollars. That night he (<font color='blue'><b>husband</b></font>) looked as if he (<font color='blue'><b>husband</b></font>) would like
the fun of quizzing her (<font color='blue'><b>John</b></font>) figures and pretending to be horrified at her (<font color='blue'><b>John</b></font>)
extravagance, as he (<font color='blue'><b>husband</b></font>) often did, being particularly proud of his (<font color='blue'><b>husband</b></font>) prudent
wife.

<p/>The little book was brought slowly out and laid down before him (<font color='blue'><b>husband</b></font>). Meg
got behind his (<font color='blue'><b>husband</b></font>) chair under pretense of smoothing the wrinkles out of
his (<font color='blue'><b>husband</b></font>) tired forehead, and standing there, she (<font color='blue'><b>Meg</b></font>) said, with her (<font color='blue'><b>Meg</b></font>) panic
increasing with every word...

<p/><div class="bookquote">``John, dear, I'm ashamed to show you my book, for I've really been
dreadfully extravagant lately. I go about so much I must have things,
you know, and Sallie advised my getting it, so I did, and my New Year's
money will partly pay for it, but I was sorry after I had done it, for
I knew you'd think it wrong in me.''

 (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div><p/>John laughed, and drew her (<font color='blue'><b>John</b></font>) round beside him (<font color='blue'><b>husband</b></font>), saying goodhumoredly,
<div class="bookquote">``Don't go and hide. I won't beat you if you have got a pair of killing
boots. I'm rather proud of my wife's feet, and don't mind if she (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>) does
pay eight or nine dollars for her (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>) boots, if they are good ones.''

 (<font color='red'><b>him</b></font>)</div><p/>That had been one of her (<font color='blue'><b>John</b></font>) last `trifles', and John's eye had fallen on
it as he (<font color='blue'><b>husband</b></font>) spoke. <div class="bookquote">``Oh, what will he (<font color='blue'><b>my</b></font>) say when he (<font color='blue'><b>my</b></font>) comes to that awful
fifty dollars!''  (<font color='red'><b>Meg</b></font>)</div>thought Meg, with a shiver.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``It's worse than boots, it's a silk dress,''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Meg</b></font>) said, with the calmness
of desperation, for she (<font color='blue'><b>Meg</b></font>) wanted the worst over.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Well, dear, what is the `dem'd total', as Mr. Mantalini says?''

 (<font color='red'><b>John/Mrs. Brooke/John Brooke</b></font>)</div><p/>That didn't sound like John, and she (<font color='blue'><b>John</b></font>) knew he (<font color='blue'><b>husband</b></font>) was looking up at her (<font color='blue'><b>John</b></font>) with
the straightforward look that she (<font color='blue'><b>John</b></font>) had always been ready to meet and
answer with one as frank till now. She (<font color='blue'><b>John</b></font>) turned the page and her (<font color='blue'><b>John</b></font>) head at
the same time, pointing to the sum which would have been bad enough
without the fifty, but which was appalling to her (<font color='blue'><b>John</b></font>) with that added. For
a minute the room was very still, then John said slowly--but she (<font color='blue'><b>John</b></font>) could
feel it cost him (<font color='blue'><b>husband</b></font>) an effort to express no displeasure--...

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Well, I don't know that fifty is much for a dress, with all the
furbelows and notions you have to have to finish it off these days.''

 (<font color='red'><b>him</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``It isn't made or trimmed,''  (<font color='red'><b>Meg</b></font>)</div>sighed Meg, faintly, for a sudden
recollection of the cost still to be incurred quite overwhelmed her (<font color='blue'><b>Meg</b></font>).

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Twenty-five yards of silk seems a good deal to cover one small woman,
but I've no doubt my wife will look as fine as Ned Moffat's when she (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>)
gets it on,''  (<font color='red'><b>John/Mrs. Brooke/John Brooke</b></font>)</div>said John dryly.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``I know you are angry, John, but I can't help it. I don't mean to
waste your money, and I didn't think those little things would count up
so. I can't resist them when I see Sallie buying all she (<font color='blue'><b>Sallie</b></font>) wants, and
pitying me because I don't. I try to be contented, but it is hard, and
I'm tired of being poor.''

 (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div><p/>The last words were spoken so low she (<font color='blue'><b>John</b></font>) thought he (<font color='blue'><b>husband</b></font>) did not hear them, but
he (<font color='blue'><b>husband</b></font>) did, and they wounded him (<font color='blue'><b>husband</b></font>) deeply, for he (<font color='blue'><b>husband</b></font>) had denied himself many
pleasures for Meg's sake. She (<font color='blue'><b>Meg</b></font>) could have bitten her (<font color='blue'><b>Meg</b></font>) tongue out the
minute she (<font color='blue'><b>Meg</b></font>) had said it, for John pushed the books away and got up,
saying with a little quiver in his (<font color='blue'><b>husband</b></font>) voice, <div class="bookquote">``I was afraid of this. I do
my best, Meg.''  (<font color='red'><b>John/Mrs. Brooke/John Brooke</b></font>)</div>If he (<font color='blue'><b>husband</b></font>) had scolded her (<font color='blue'><b>John</b></font>), or even shaken her (<font color='blue'><b>John</b></font>), it would not
have broken her (<font color='blue'><b>John</b></font>) heart like those few words. She (<font color='blue'><b>John</b></font>) ran to him (<font color='blue'><b>husband</b></font>) and held
him (<font color='blue'><b>husband</b></font>) close, crying, with repentant tears, <div class="bookquote">``Oh, John, my dear, kind,
hard-working boy. I didn't mean it! It was so wicked, so untrue and
ungrateful, how could I say it! Oh, how could I say it!''

 (<font color='red'><b>him</b></font>)</div><p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>husband</b></font>) was very kind, forgave her (<font color='blue'><b>John</b></font>) readily, and did not utter one reproach,
but Meg knew that she (<font color='blue'><b>Meg</b></font>) had done and said a thing which would not be
forgotten soon, although he (<font color='blue'><b>husband</b></font>) might never allude to it again. She (<font color='blue'><b>Meg</b></font>) had
promised to love him (<font color='blue'><b>husband</b></font>) for better or worse, and then she (<font color='blue'><b>Meg</b></font>), his (<font color='blue'><b>husband</b></font>) wife, had
reproached him (<font color='blue'><b>husband</b></font>) with his (<font color='blue'><b>husband</b></font>) poverty, after spending his (<font color='blue'><b>husband</b></font>) earnings
recklessly. It was dreadful, and the worst of it was John went on so
quietly afterward, just as if nothing had happened, except that he (<font color='blue'><b>husband</b></font>)
stayed in town later, and worked at night when she (<font color='blue'><b>John</b></font>) had gone to cry
herself to sleep. A week of remorse nearly made Meg sick, and the
discovery that John had countermanded the order for his (<font color='blue'><b>husband</b></font>) new greatcoat
reduced her (<font color='blue'><b>John</b></font>) to a state of despair which was pathetic to behold. He (<font color='blue'><b>husband</b></font>) had
simply said, in answer to her (<font color='blue'><b>John</b></font>) surprised inquiries as to the change, <div class="bookquote">``I
can't afford it, my dear.''

 (<font color='red'><b>He</b></font>)</div><p/>Meg said no more, but a few minutes after he (<font color='blue'><b>husband</b></font>) found her (<font color='blue'><b>Meg</b></font>) in the hall with
her (<font color='blue'><b>Meg</b></font>) face buried in the old greatcoat, crying as if her (<font color='blue'><b>Meg</b></font>) heart would
break.

<p/>They had a long talk that night, and Meg learned to love her (<font color='blue'><b>Meg</b></font>) husband
better for his (<font color='blue'><b>husband</b></font>) poverty, because it seemed to have made a man of him (<font color='blue'><b>husband</b></font>),
given him (<font color='blue'><b>husband</b></font>) the strength and courage to fight his (<font color='blue'><b>husband</b></font>) own way, and taught him (<font color='blue'><b>husband</b></font>)
a tender patience with which to bear and comfort the natural longings
and failures of those he (<font color='blue'><b>husband</b></font>) loved.

<p/>Next day she (<font color='blue'><b>Meg</b></font>) put her (<font color='blue'><b>Meg</b></font>) pride in her (<font color='blue'><b>Meg</b></font>) pocket, went to Sallie, told the
truth, and asked her (<font color='blue'><b>Meg</b></font>) to buy the silk as a favor. The good-natured Mrs.
Moffat willingly did so, and had the delicacy not to make her (<font color='blue'><b>Moffat</b></font>) a present
of it immediately afterward. Then Meg ordered home the greatcoat, and
when John arrived, she (<font color='blue'><b>John</b></font>) put it on, and asked him (<font color='blue'><b>husband</b></font>) how he (<font color='blue'><b>husband</b></font>) liked her (<font color='blue'><b>John</b></font>) new
silk gown. One can imagine what answer he (<font color='blue'><b>husband</b></font>) made, how he (<font color='blue'><b>husband</b></font>) received his (<font color='blue'><b>husband</b></font>)
present, and what a blissful state of things ensued. John came home
early, Meg gadded no more, and that greatcoat was put on in the morning
by a very happy husband, and taken off at night by a most devoted
little wife. So the year rolled round, and at midsummer there came to
Meg a new experience, the deepest and tenderest of a woman's life.

<p/>Laurie came sneaking into the kitchen of the Dovecote one Saturday,
with an excited face, and was received with the clash of cymbals, for
Hannah clapped her (<font color='blue'><b>Hannah</b></font>) hands with a saucepan in one and the cover in the
other.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``How's the little mamma? Where is everybody? Why didn't you tell me
before I came home?''  (<font color='red'><b>Laurie/Mr. Laurie/LAURIE</b></font>)</div>began Laurie in a loud whisper.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Happy as a queen, the dear! Every soul of 'em is upstairs a
worshipin'. We didn't want no hurrycanes round. Now you go into the
parlor, and I'll send 'em down to you,''  (<font color='red'><b>Hannah</b></font>)</div>with which somewhat involved
reply Hannah vanished, chuckling ecstatically.

<p/>Presently Jo appeared, proudly bearing a flannel bundle laid forth upon
a large pillow. Jo's face was very sober, but her (<font color='blue'><b>Jo</b></font>) eyes twinkled, and
there was an odd sound in her (<font color='blue'><b>Jo</b></font>) voice of repressed emotion of some sort.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Shut your eyes and hold out your arms,''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Jo</b></font>) said invitingly.

<p/>Laurie backed precipitately into a corner, and put his (<font color='blue'><b>Laurie</b></font>) hands behind him (<font color='blue'><b>Laurie</b></font>)
with an imploring gesture. <div class="bookquote">``No, thank you. I'd rather not. I shall
drop it or smash it, as sure as fate.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Then you shan't see your nevvy,''  (<font color='red'><b>Jo/Miss Jo/JO</b></font>)</div>said Jo decidedly, turning as if to
go.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``I will, I will! Only you must be responsible for damages.''  (<font color='red'><b>Laurie/Mr. Laurie/LAURIE</b></font>)</div>and
obeying orders, Laurie heroically shut his (<font color='blue'><b>Laurie</b></font>) eyes while something was put
into his (<font color='blue'><b>Laurie</b></font>) arms. A peal of laughter from Jo, Amy, Mrs. March, Hannah,
and John caused him (<font color='blue'><b>Laurie</b></font>) to open them the next minute, to find himself
invested with two babies instead of one.

<p/>No wonder they laughed, for the expression of his (<font color='blue'><b>Laurie</b></font>) face was droll enough
to convulse a Quaker, as he (<font color='blue'><b>Laurie</b></font>) stood and stared wildly from the
unconscious innocents to the hilarious spectators with such dismay that
Jo sat down on the floor and screamed.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Twins, by Jupiter!''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>was all he (<font color='blue'><b>Laurie</b></font>) said for a minute, then turning to the
women with an appealing look that was comically piteous, he (<font color='blue'><b>Laurie</b></font>) added,
<div class="bookquote">``Take 'em quick, somebody! I'm going to laugh, and I shall drop 'em.''

 (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div><p/>Jo rescued his (<font color='blue'><b>Laurie</b></font>) babies, and marched up and down, with one on each arm,
as if already initiated into the mysteries of babytending, while Laurie
laughed till the tears ran down his (<font color='blue'><b>Laurie</b></font>) cheeks.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``It's the best joke of the season, isn't it? I wouldn't have told you,
for I set my heart on surprising you, and I flatter myself I've done
it,''  (<font color='red'><b>Jo/Miss Jo/JO</b></font>)</div>said Jo, when she (<font color='blue'><b>Jo</b></font>) got her (<font color='blue'><b>Jo</b></font>) breath.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``I never was more staggered in my life. Isn't it fun? Are they boys?
What are you going to name them? Let's have another look. Hold me up,
Jo, for upon my life it's one too many for me,''  (<font color='red'><b>Laurie/Mr. Laurie/LAURIE</b></font>)</div>returned Laurie,
regarding the infants with the air of a big, benevolent Newfoundland
looking at a pair of infantile kittens.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Boy and girl. Aren't they beauties?''  (<font color='red'><b>the papa</b></font>)</div>said the proud papa, beaming
upon the little red squirmers as if they were unfledged angels.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Most remarkable children I ever saw. Which is which?''  (<font color='red'><b>Laurie/Mr. Laurie/LAURIE</b></font>)</div>and Laurie bent
like a well-sweep to examine the prodigies.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Amy put a blue ribbon on the boy and a pink on the girl, French
fashion, so you can always tell. Besides, one has blue eyes and one
brown. Kiss them, Uncle Teddy,''  (<font color='red'><b>Jo/Miss Jo/JO</b></font>)</div>said wicked Jo.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``I'm afraid they mightn't like it,''  (<font color='red'><b>Laurie/Mr. Laurie/LAURIE</b></font>)</div>began Laurie, with unusual timidity
in such matters.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Of course they will, they are used to it now. Do it this minute,
sir!''  (<font color='red'><b>Jo/Miss Jo/JO</b></font>)</div>commanded Jo, fearing he (<font color='blue'><b>Laurie</b></font>) might propose a proxy.

<p/>Laurie screwed up his (<font color='blue'><b>Laurie</b></font>) face and obeyed with a gingerly peck at each
little cheek that produced another laugh, and made the babies squeal.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``There, I knew they didn't like it! That's the boy, see him (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>) kick, he (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>)
hits out with his (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>) fists like a good one. Now then, young Brooke, pitch
into a man of your own size, will you?''  (<font color='red'><b>Laurie/Mr. Laurie/LAURIE</b></font>)</div>cried Laurie, delighted with a
poke in the face from a tiny fist, flapping aimlessly about.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``He (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>)'s to be named John Laurence, and the girl Margaret, after mother
and grandmother. We shall call her (<font color='blue'><b>Margaret</b></font>) Daisey, so as not to have two Megs,
and I suppose the mannie will be Jack, unless we find a better name,''
 (<font color='red'><b>Amy/Amy March</b></font>)</div>said Amy, with aunt-like interest.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Name him (<font color='blue'><b>Jack</b></font>) Demijohn, and call him (<font color='blue'><b>Jack</b></font>) Demi for short,''  (<font color='red'><b>Laurie/Mr. Laurie/LAURIE</b></font>)</div>said Laurie.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Daisy and Demi, just the thing! I knew Teddy would do it,''  (<font color='red'><b>Jo/Miss Jo/JO</b></font>)</div>cried Jo
clapping her (<font color='blue'><b>Jo</b></font>) hands.

<p/>Teddy certainly had done it that time, for the babies were ``Daisy' and
``Demi' to the end of the chapter.



<p/>CHAPTER TWENTY-NINE

<p/>CALLS

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Come, Jo, it's time.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``For what?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``You don't mean to say you have forgotten that you promised to make
half a dozen calls with me today?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I've done a good many rash and foolish things in my life, but I don't
think I ever was mad enough to say I'd make six calls in one day, when
a single one upsets me for a week.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Yes, you did, it was a bargain between us. I was to finish the crayon
of Beth for you, and you were to go properly with me, and return our
neighbors' visits.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``If it was fair, that was in the bond, and I stand to the letter of my
bond, Shylock. There is a pile of clouds in the east, it's not fair,
and I don't go.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Now, that's shirking. It's a lovely day, no prospect of rain, and you
pride yourself on keeping promises, so be honorable, come and do your
duty, and then be at peace for another six months.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Jo/Miss Jo/JO</b></font>)</div><p/>At that minute Jo was particularly absorbed in dressmaking, for she (<font color='blue'><b>Jo</b></font>) was
mantua-maker general to the family, and took especial credit to herself
because she (<font color='blue'><b>Jo</b></font>) could use a needle as well as a pen. It was very provoking
to be arrested in the act of a first trying-on, and ordered out to make
calls in her (<font color='blue'><b>Jo</b></font>) best array on a warm July day. She (<font color='blue'><b>Jo</b></font>) hated calls of the
formal sort, and never made any till Amy compelled her (<font color='blue'><b>Amy</b></font>) with a bargain,
bribe, or promise. In the present instance there was no escape, and
having clashed her (<font color='blue'><b>Amy</b></font>) scissors rebelliously, while protesting that she (<font color='blue'><b>Amy</b></font>)
smelled thunder, she (<font color='blue'><b>Amy</b></font>) gave in, put away her (<font color='blue'><b>Amy</b></font>) work, and taking up her (<font color='blue'><b>Amy</b></font>) hat
and gloves with an air of resignation, told Amy the victim was ready.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Jo March, you are perverse enough to provoke a saint! You don't
intend to make calls in that state, I hope,''  (<font color='red'><b>Amy/Amy March</b></font>)</div>cried Amy, surveying her (<font color='blue'><b>Amy</b></font>)
with amazement.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Why not? I'm neat and cool and comfortable, quite proper for a dusty
walk on a warm day. If people care more for my clothes than they do
for me, I don't wish to see them. You can dress for both, and be as
elegant as you please. It pays for you to be fine. It doesn't for me,
and furbelows only worry me.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Oh, dear!''  (<font color='red'><b>Amy/Amy March</b></font>)</div>sighed Amy, <div class="bookquote">``now she (<font color='blue'><b>they</b></font>)'s in a contrary fit, and will drive me
distracted before I can get her (<font color='blue'><b>they</b></font>) properly ready. I'm sure it's no
pleasure to me to go today, but it's a debt we owe society, and there's
no one to pay it but you and me. I'll do anything for you, Jo, if
you'll only dress yourself nicely, and come and help me do the civil.
You can talk so well, look so aristocratic in your best things, and
behave so beautifully, if you try, that I'm proud of you. I'm afraid
to go alone, do come and take care of me.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Amy/Amy March</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``You're an artful little puss to flatter and wheedle your cross old
sister in that way. The idea of my being aristocratic and well-bred,
and your being afraid to go anywhere alone! I don't know which is the
most absurd. Well, I'll go if I must, and do my best. You shall be
commander of the expedition, and I'll obey blindly, will that satisfy
you?''  (<font color='red'><b>Jo/Miss Jo/JO</b></font>)</div>said Jo, with a sudden change from perversity to lamblike
submission.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``You're a perfect cherub! Now put on all your best things, and I'll
tell you how to behave at each place, so that you will make a good
impression. I want people to like you, and they would if you'd only
try to be a little more agreeable. Do your hair the pretty way, and
put the pink rose in your bonnet. It's becoming, and you look too
sober in your plain suit. Take your light gloves and the embroidered
handkerchief. We'll stop at Meg's, and borrow her (<font color='blue'><b>Meg</b></font>) white sunshade, and
then you can have my dove-colored one.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Amy/Amy March</b></font>)</div><p/>While Amy dressed, she (<font color='blue'><b>Amy</b></font>) issued her (<font color='blue'><b>Amy</b></font>) orders, and Jo obeyed them, not
without entering her (<font color='blue'><b>Jo</b></font>) protest, however, for she (<font color='blue'><b>Jo</b></font>) sighed as she (<font color='blue'><b>Jo</b></font>) rustled
into her (<font color='blue'><b>Jo</b></font>) new organdie, frowned darkly at herself as she (<font color='blue'><b>Jo</b></font>) tied her (<font color='blue'><b>Jo</b></font>) bonnet
strings in an irreproachable bow, wrestled viciously with pins as she (<font color='blue'><b>Jo</b></font>)
put on her (<font color='blue'><b>Jo</b></font>) collar, wrinkled up her (<font color='blue'><b>Jo</b></font>) features generally as she (<font color='blue'><b>Jo</b></font>) shook out
the handkerchief, whose embroidery was as irritating to her (<font color='blue'><b>Jo</b></font>) nose as the
present mission was to her (<font color='blue'><b>Jo</b></font>) feelings, and when she (<font color='blue'><b>Jo</b></font>) had squeezed her (<font color='blue'><b>Jo</b></font>)
hands into tight gloves with three buttons and a tassel, as the last
touch of elegance, she (<font color='blue'><b>Jo</b></font>) turned to Amy with an imbecile expression of
countenance, saying meekly...

<p/><div class="bookquote">``I'm perfectly miserable, but if you consider me presentable, I die
happy.''

 (<font color='red'><b>imbecile</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``You're highly satisfactory. Turn slowly round, and let me get a
careful view.''  (<font color='red'><b>Jo/Miss Jo/JO</b></font>)</div>Jo revolved, and Amy gave a touch here and there, then
fell back, with her (<font color='blue'><b>Amy</b></font>) head on one side, observing graciously, <div class="bookquote">``Yes,
you'll do. Your head is all I could ask, for that white bonnet with
the rose is quite ravishing. Hold back your shoulders, and carry your
hands easily, no matter if your gloves do pinch. There's one thing you
can do well, Jo, that is, wear a shawl. I can't, but it's very nice to
see you, and I'm so glad Aunt March gave you that lovely one. It's
simple, but handsome, and those folds over the arm are really artistic.
Is the point of my mantle in the middle, and have I looped my dress
evenly? I like to show my boots, for my feet are pretty, though my nose
isn't.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Amy/Amy March</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``You are a thing of beauty and a joy forever,''  (<font color='red'><b>Jo/Miss Jo/JO</b></font>)</div>said Jo, looking through
her (<font color='blue'><b>Jo</b></font>) hand with the air of a connoisseur at the blue feather against the
golden hair. <div class="bookquote">``Am I to drag my best dress through the dust, or loop it
up, please, ma'am?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Hold it up when you walk, but drop it in the house. The sweeping
style suits you best, and you must learn to trail your skirts
gracefully. You haven't half buttoned one cuff, do it at once. You'll
never look finished if you are not careful about the little details,
for they make up the pleasing whole.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Jo/Miss Jo/JO</b></font>)</div><p/>Jo sighed, and proceeded to burst the buttons off her (<font color='blue'><b>Jo</b></font>) glove, in doing
up her (<font color='blue'><b>Jo</b></font>) cuff, but at last both were ready, and sailed away, looking as
`pretty as picters', Hannah said, as she (<font color='blue'><b>Hannah</b></font>) hung out of the upper window
to watch them.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Now, Jo dear, the Chesters consider themselves very elegant people, so
I want you to put on your best deportment. Don't make any of your
abrupt remarks, or do anything odd, will you? Just be calm, cool, and
quiet, that's safe and ladylike, and you can easily do it for fifteen
minutes,''  (<font color='red'><b>Amy/Amy March</b></font>)</div>said Amy, as they approached the first place, having borrowed
the white parasol and been inspected by Meg, with a baby on each arm.

<p/>``Let me see. <div class="bookquote">``Calm, cool, and quiet', yes, I think I can promise that.
I've played the part of a prim young lady on the stage, and I'll try it
off. My powers are great, as you shall see, so be easy in your mind,
my child.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Amy/Amy March</b></font>)</div><p/>Amy looked relieved, but naughty Jo took her (<font color='blue'><b>Jo</b></font>) at her (<font color='blue'><b>Jo</b></font>) word, for during
the first call she (<font color='blue'><b>Jo</b></font>) sat with every limb gracefully composed, every fold
correctly draped, calm as a summer sea, cool as a snowbank, and as
silent as the sphinx. In vain Mrs. Chester alluded to her (<font color='blue'><b>Chester</b></font>) `charming
novel', and the Misses Chester introduced parties, picnics, the opera,
and the fashions. Each and all were answered by a smile, a bow, and a
demure <div class="bookquote">``Yes''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>or <div class="bookquote">``No''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>with the chill on. In vain Amy telegraphed the
word `talk', tried to draw her (<font color='blue'><b>Amy</b></font>) out, and administered covert pokes with
her (<font color='blue'><b>Amy</b></font>) foot. Jo sat as if blandly unconscious of it all, with deportment
like Maud's face, `icily regular, splendidly null'.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``What a haughty, uninteresting creature that oldest Miss March is!''  (<font color='red'><b>the ladies</b></font>)</div>was
the unfortunately audible remark of one of the ladies, as the door
closed upon their guests. Jo laughed noiselessly all through the hall,
but Amy looked disgusted at the failure of her (<font color='blue'><b>Amy</b></font>) instructions, and very
naturally laid the blame upon Jo.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``How could you mistake me so? I merely meant you to be properly
dignified and composed, and you made yourself a perfect stock and
stone. Try to be sociable at the Lambs'. Gossip as other girls do,
and be interested in dress and flirtations and whatever nonsense comes
up. They move in the best society, are valuable persons for us to
know, and I wouldn't fail to make a good impression there for anything.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/>``I'll be agreeable. I'll gossip and giggle, and have horrors and
raptures over any trifle you like. I rather enjoy this, and now I'll
imitate what is called 'a charming girl'. I can do it, for I have May
Chester as a model, and I'll improve upon her (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>). See if the Lambs don't
say, <div class="bookquote">``What a lively, nice creature that Jo March is!''

 (<font color='red'><b>Amy/Amy March</b></font>)</div><p/>Amy felt anxious, as well she (<font color='blue'><b>Amy</b></font>) might, for when Jo turned freakish there
was no knowing where she (<font color='blue'><b>Jo</b></font>) would stop. Amy's face was a study when she (<font color='blue'><b>Amy</b></font>)
saw her (<font color='blue'><b>Amy</b></font>) sister skim into the next drawing room, kiss all the young
ladies with effusion, beam graciously upon the young gentlemen, and
join in the chat with a spirit which amazed the beholder. Amy was taken
possession of by Mrs. Lamb, with whom she (<font color='blue'><b>Amy</b></font>) was a favorite, and forced to
hear a long account of Lucretia's last attack, while three delightful
young gentlemen hovered near, waiting for a pause when they might rush
in and rescue her (<font color='blue'><b>Lucretia</b></font>). So situated, she (<font color='blue'><b>Lucretia</b></font>) was powerless to check Jo, who
seemed possessed by a spirit of mischief, and talked away as volubly as
the lady. A knot of heads gathered about her (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>), and Amy strained her (<font color='blue'><b>Amy</b></font>)
ears to hear what was going on, for broken sentences filled her (<font color='blue'><b>Amy</b></font>) with
curiosity, and frequent peals of laughter made her (<font color='blue'><b>Amy</b></font>) wild to share the
fun. One may imagine her (<font color='blue'><b>Amy</b></font>) suffering on overhearing fragments of this
sort of conversation.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``She (<font color='blue'><b>March</b></font>) rides splendidly. Who taught her (<font color='blue'><b>March</b></font>)?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``No one. She (<font color='blue'><b>March</b></font>) used to practice mounting, holding the reins, and sitting
straight on an old saddle in a tree. Now she (<font color='blue'><b>March</b></font>) rides anything, for she (<font color='blue'><b>March</b></font>)
doesn't know what fear is, and the stableman lets her (<font color='blue'><b>March</b></font>) have horses cheap
because she (<font color='blue'><b>March</b></font>) trains them to carry ladies so well. She (<font color='blue'><b>March</b></font>) has such a
passion for it, I often tell her (<font color='blue'><b>March</b></font>) if everything else fails, she (<font color='blue'><b>March</b></font>) can be a
horsebreaker, and get her (<font color='blue'><b>March</b></font>) living so.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Amy/Amy March</b></font>)</div><p/>At this awful speech Amy contained herself with difficulty, for the
impression was being given that she (<font color='blue'><b>Amy</b></font>) was rather a fast young lady, which
was her (<font color='blue'><b>Amy</b></font>) especial aversion. But what could she (<font color='blue'><b>Amy</b></font>) do? For the old lady
was in the middle of her (<font color='blue'><b>Amy</b></font>) story, and long before it was done, Jo was off
again, making more droll revelations and committing still more fearful
blunders.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Yes, Amy was in despair that day, for all the good beasts were gone,
and of three left, one was lame, one blind, and the other so balky that
you had to put dirt in his (<font color='blue'><b>stableman</b></font>) mouth before he (<font color='blue'><b>stableman</b></font>) would start. Nice animal for
a pleasure party, wasn't it?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Which did she (<font color='blue'><b>Amy</b></font>) choose?''  (<font color='red'><b>the laughing gentlemen</b></font>)</div>asked one of the laughing gentlemen, who
enjoyed the subject.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``None of them. She (<font color='blue'><b>Amy</b></font>) heard of a young horse at the farm house over the
river, and though a lady had never ridden him (<font color='blue'><b>stableman</b></font>), she (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) resolved to try,
because he (<font color='blue'><b>stableman</b></font>) was handsome and spirited. Her (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) struggles were really
pathetic. There was no one to bring the horse to the saddle, so she (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>)
took the saddle to the horse. My dear creature, she (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) actually rowed it
over the river, put it on her (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) head, and marched up to the barn to the
utter amazement of the old man!''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Did she (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) ride the horse?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Of course she (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) did, and had a capital time. I expected to see her (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>)
brought home in fragments, but she (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) managed him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) perfectly, and was the
life of the party.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Well, I call that plucky!''  (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Lamb</b></font>)</div>and young Mr. Lamb turned an approving
glance upon Amy, wondering what his (<font color='blue'><b>Lamb</b></font>) mother could be saying to make the
girl look so red and uncomfortable.

<p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>Amy</b></font>) was still redder and more uncomfortable a moment after, when a
sudden turn in the conversation introduced the subject of dress. One
of the young ladies asked Jo where she (<font color='blue'><b>Jo</b></font>) got the pretty drab hat she (<font color='blue'><b>Jo</b></font>) wore
to the picnic and stupid Jo, instead of mentioning the place where it
was bought two years ago, must needs answer with unnecessary frankness,
<div class="bookquote">``Oh, Amy painted it. You can't buy those soft shades, so we paint ours
any color we like. It's a great comfort to have an artistic sister.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Jo/Miss Jo/JO</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Isn't that an original idea?''  (<font color='red'><b>Miss Lamb</b></font>)</div>cried Miss Lamb, who found Jo great fun.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``That's nothing compared to some of her (<font color='blue'><b>sister</b></font>) brilliant performances. There's
nothing the child can't do. Why, she (<font color='blue'><b>sister</b></font>) wanted a pair of blue boots for
Sallie's party, so she (<font color='blue'><b>Sallie</b></font>) just painted her (<font color='blue'><b>Sallie</b></font>) soiled white ones the loveliest
shade of sky blue you ever saw, and they looked exactly like satin,''
 (<font color='red'><b>Jo/Miss Jo/JO</b></font>)</div>added Jo, with an air of pride in her (<font color='blue'><b>Jo</b></font>) sister's accomplishments that
exasperated Amy till she (<font color='blue'><b>Amy</b></font>) felt that it would be a relief to throw her (<font color='blue'><b>Amy</b></font>)
cardcase at her (<font color='blue'><b>Amy</b></font>).

<p/><div class="bookquote">``We read a story of yours the other day, and enjoyed it very much,''
 (<font color='red'><b>the Miss Lamb</b></font>)</div>observed the elder Miss Lamb, wishing to compliment the literary lady,
who did not look the character just then, it must be confessed.

<p/>Any mention of her (<font color='blue'><b>Lamb</b></font>) `works' always had a bad effect upon Jo, who either
grew rigid and looked offended, or changed the subject with a brusque
remark, as now. <div class="bookquote">``Sorry you could find nothing better to read. I write
that rubbish because it sells, and ordinary people like it. Are you
going to New York this winter?''

 (<font color='red'><b>Miss Lamb</b></font>)</div><p/>As Miss Lamb had `enjoyed' the story, this speech was not exactly
grateful or complimentary. The minute it was made Jo saw her (<font color='blue'><b>Jo</b></font>) mistake,
but fearing to make the matter worse, suddenly remembered that it was
for her (<font color='blue'><b>Jo</b></font>) to make the first move toward departure, and did so with an
abruptness that left three people with half-finished sentences in their
mouths.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Amy, we must go. Good-by, dear, do come and see us. We are pining
for a visit. I don't dare to ask you, Mr. Lamb, but if you should
come, I don't think I shall have the heart to send you away.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Jo/Miss Jo/JO</b></font>)</div><p/>Jo said this with such a droll imitation of May Chester's gushing style
that Amy got out of the room as rapidly as possible, feeling a strong
desire to laugh and cry at the same time.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Didn't I do well?''  (<font color='red'><b>Jo/Miss Jo/JO</b></font>)</div>asked Jo, with a satisfied air as they walked away.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Nothing could have been worse,''  (<font color='red'><b>Amy/Amy March</b></font>)</div>was Amy's crushing reply. <div class="bookquote">``What
possessed you to tell those stories about my saddle, and the hats and
boots, and all the rest of it?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Why, it's funny, and amuses people. They know we are poor, so it's no
use pretending that we have grooms, buy three or four hats a season,
and have things as easy and fine as they do.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``You needn't go and tell them all our little shifts, and expose our
poverty in that perfectly unnecessary way. You haven't a bit of proper
pride, and never will learn when to hold your tongue and when to
speak,''  (<font color='red'><b>Amy/Amy March</b></font>)</div>said Amy despairingly.

<p/>Poor Jo looked abashed, and silently chafed the end of her (<font color='blue'><b>Jo</b></font>) nose with
the stiff handkerchief, as if performing a penance for her (<font color='blue'><b>Jo</b></font>) misdemeanors.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``How shall I behave here?''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Jo</b></font>) asked, as they approached the third
mansion.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Just as you please. I wash my hands of you,''  (<font color='red'><b>Amy/Amy March</b></font>)</div>was Amy's short answer.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Then I'll enjoy myself. The boys are at home, and we'll have a
comfortable time. Goodness knows I need a little change, for elegance
has a bad effect upon my constitution,''  (<font color='red'><b>Jo/Miss Jo/JO</b></font>)</div>returned Jo gruffly, being
disturbed by her (<font color='blue'><b>Jo</b></font>) failure to suit.

<p/>An enthusiastic welcome from three big boys and several pretty children
speedily soothed her (<font color='blue'><b>Jo</b></font>) ruffled feelings, and leaving Amy to entertain the
hostess and Mr. Tudor, who happened to be calling likewise, Jo devoted
herself to the young folks and found the change refreshing. She (<font color='blue'><b>Jo</b></font>)
listened to college stories with deep interest, caressed pointers and
poodles without a murmur, agreed heartily that <div class="bookquote">``Tom Brown was a brick,''
 (<font color='red'><b>poodles</b></font>)</div>regardless of the improper form of praise, and when one lad proposed a
visit to his (<font color='blue'><b>lad</b></font>) turtle tank, she (<font color='blue'><b>Jo</b></font>) went with an alacrity which caused Mamma
to smile upon her (<font color='blue'><b>Jo</b></font>), as that motherly lady settled the cap which was left
in a ruinous condition by filial hugs, bearlike but affectionate, and
dearer to her (<font color='blue'><b>Jo</b></font>) than the most faultless coiffure from the hands of an
inspired Frenchwoman.

<p/>Leaving her (<font color='blue'><b>Jo</b></font>) sister to her (<font color='blue'><b>Jo</b></font>) own devices, Amy proceeded to enjoy herself
to her (<font color='blue'><b>Amy</b></font>) heart's content. Mr. Tudor's uncle had married an English lady
who was third cousin to a living lord, and Amy regarded the whole
family with great respect, for in spite of her (<font color='blue'><b>Amy</b></font>) American birth and
breeding, she (<font color='blue'><b>Amy</b></font>) possessed that reverence for titles which haunts the best
of us--that unacknowledged loyalty to the early faith in kings which
set the most democratic nation under the sun in ferment at the coming
of a royal yellow-haired laddie, some years ago, and which still has
something to do with the love the young country bears the old, like
that of a big son for an imperious little mother, who held him (<font color='blue'><b>son</b></font>) while
she (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) could, and let him (<font color='blue'><b>son</b></font>) go with a farewell scolding when he (<font color='blue'><b>son</b></font>) rebelled.
But even the satisfaction of talking with a distant connection of the
British nobility did not render Amy forgetful of time, and when the
proper number of minutes had passed, she (<font color='blue'><b>Amy</b></font>) reluctantly tore herself from
this aristocratic society, and looked about for Jo, fervently hoping
that her (<font color='blue'><b>Jo</b></font>) incorrigible sister would not be found in any position which
should bring disgrace upon the name of March.

<p/>It might have been worse, but Amy considered it bad. For Jo sat on the
grass, with an encampment of boys about her (<font color='blue'><b>Amy</b></font>), and a dirty-footed dog
reposing on the skirt of her (<font color='blue'><b>Amy</b></font>) state and festival dress, as she (<font color='blue'><b>Amy</b></font>) related
one of Laurie's pranks to her (<font color='blue'><b>Amy</b></font>) admiring audience. One small child was
poking turtles with Amy's cherished parasol, a second was eating
gingerbread over Jo's best bonnet, and a third playing ball with her (<font color='blue'><b>Jo</b></font>)
gloves, but all were enjoying themselves, and when Jo collected her (<font color='blue'><b>Jo</b></font>)
damaged property to go, her (<font color='blue'><b>Jo</b></font>) escort accompanied her (<font color='blue'><b>Jo</b></font>), begging her (<font color='blue'><b>Jo</b></font>) to come
again, <div class="bookquote">``It was such fun to hear about Laurie's larks.''

 (<font color='red'><b>her</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Capital boys, aren't they? I feel quite young and brisk again after
that.''  (<font color='red'><b>Jo/Miss Jo/JO</b></font>)</div>said Jo, strolling along with her (<font color='blue'><b>Jo</b></font>) hands behind her (<font color='blue'><b>Jo</b></font>), partly from
habit, partly to conceal the bespattered parasol.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Why do you always avoid Mr. Tudor?''  (<font color='red'><b>Amy/Amy March</b></font>)</div>asked Amy, wisely refraining from
any comment upon Jo's dilapidated appearance.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Don't like him (<font color='blue'><b>Tudor</b></font>), he (<font color='blue'><b>Tudor</b></font>) puts on airs, snubs his (<font color='blue'><b>Tudor</b></font>) sisters, worries his (<font color='blue'><b>Tudor</b></font>)
father, and doesn't speak respectfully of his (<font color='blue'><b>Tudor</b></font>) mother. Laurie says he (<font color='blue'><b>Laurie</b></font>)
is fast, and I don't consider him (<font color='blue'><b>Laurie</b></font>) a desirable acquaintance, so I let
him (<font color='blue'><b>Laurie</b></font>) alone.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``You might treat him (<font color='blue'><b>Laurie</b></font>) civilly, at least. You gave him (<font color='blue'><b>Laurie</b></font>) a cool nod, and
just now you bowed and smiled in the politest way to Tommy Chamberlain,
whose father keeps a grocery store. If you had just reversed the nod
and the bow, it would have been right,''  (<font color='red'><b>Amy/Amy March</b></font>)</div>said Amy reprovingly.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``No, it wouldn't,''  (<font color='red'><b>Jo/Miss Jo/JO</b></font>)</div>returned Jo, <div class="bookquote">``I neither like, respect, nor admire
Tudor, though his (<font color='blue'><b>Tudor</b></font>) grandfather's uncle's nephew's niece was a third
cousin to a lord. Tommy is poor and bashful and good and very clever.
I think well of him (<font color='blue'><b>Tommy</b></font>), and like to show that I do, for he (<font color='blue'><b>Tommy</b></font>) is a gentleman
in spite of the brown paper parcels.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Jo/Miss Jo/JO</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``It's no use trying to argue with you,''  (<font color='red'><b>Amy/Amy March</b></font>)</div>began Amy.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Not the least, my dear,''  (<font color='red'><b>Jo/Miss Jo/JO</b></font>)</div>interrupted Jo, <div class="bookquote">``so let us look amiable, and
drop a card here, as the Kings are evidently out, for which I'm deeply
grateful.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Jo/Miss Jo/JO</b></font>)</div><p/>The family cardcase having done its duty the girls walked on, and Jo
uttered another thanksgiving on reaching the fifth house, and being
told that the young ladies were engaged.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Now let us go home, and never mind Aunt March today. We can run down
there any time, and it's really a pity to trail through the dust in our
best bibs and tuckers, when we are tired and cross.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Speak for yourself, if you please. Aunt March likes to have us pay
her (<font color='blue'><b>Aunt</b></font>) the compliment of coming in style, and making a formal call. It's a
little thing to do, but it gives her (<font color='blue'><b>Aunt</b></font>) pleasure, and I don't believe it
will hurt your things half so much as letting dirty dogs and clumping
boys spoil them. Stoop down, and let me take the crumbs off of your
bonnet.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``What a good girl you are, Amy!''  (<font color='red'><b>Jo/Miss Jo/JO</b></font>)</div>said Jo, with a repentant glance from
her (<font color='blue'><b>Jo</b></font>) own damaged costume to that of her (<font color='blue'><b>Jo</b></font>) sister, which was fresh and
spotless still. <div class="bookquote">``I wish it was as easy for me to do little things to
please people as it is for you. I think of them, but it takes too much
time to do them, so I wait for a chance to confer a great favor, and
let the small ones slip, but they tell best in the end, I fancy.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Amy/Amy March</b></font>)</div><p/>Amy smiled and was mollified at once, saying with a maternal air,
<div class="bookquote">``Women should learn to be agreeable, particularly poor ones, for they
have no other way of repaying the kindnesses they receive. If you'd
remember that, and practice it, you'd be better liked than I am,
because there is more of you.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Amy/Amy March</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I'm a crotchety old thing, and always shall be, but I'm willing to own
that you are right, only it's easier for me to risk my life for a
person than to be pleasant to him (<font color='blue'><b>Women</b></font>) when I don't feel like it. It's a
great misfortune to have such strong likes and dislikes, isn't it?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``It's a greater not to be able to hide them. I don't mind saying that
I don't approve of Tudor any more than you do, but I'm not called upon
to tell him (<font color='blue'><b>Tudor</b></font>) so. Neither are you, and there is no use in making
yourself disagreeable because he (<font color='blue'><b>Tudor</b></font>) is.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``But I think girls ought to show when they disapprove of young men, and
how can they do it except by their manners? Preaching does not do any
good, as I know to my sorrow, since I've had Teddie to manage. But
there are many little ways in which I can influence him (<font color='blue'><b>Tudor</b></font>) without a word,
and I say we ought to do it to others if we can.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Teddy is a remarkable boy, and can't be taken as a sample of other
boys,''  (<font color='red'><b>Amy/Amy March</b></font>)</div>said Amy, in a tone of solemn conviction, which would have
convulsed the `remarkable boy' if he (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>) had heard it. <div class="bookquote">``If we were belles,
or women of wealth and position, we might do something, perhaps, but
for us to frown at one set of young gentlemen because we don't approve
of them, and smile upon another set because we do, wouldn't have a
particle of effect, and we should only be considered odd and
puritanical.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``So we are to countenance things and people which we detest, merely
because we are not belles and millionaires, are we? That's a nice sort
of morality.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I can't argue about it, I only know that it's the way of the world,
and people who set themselves against it only get laughed at for their
pains. I don't like reformers, and I hope you never try to be one.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I do like them, and I shall be one if I can, for in spite of the
laughing the world would never get on without them. We can't agree
about that, for you belong to the old set, and I to the new. You will
get on the best, but I shall have the liveliest time of it. I should
rather enjoy the brickbats and hooting, I think.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Well, compose yourself now, and don't worry Aunt with your new ideas.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I'll try not to, but I'm always possessed to burst out with some
particularly blunt speech or revolutionary sentiment before her (<font color='blue'><b>Aunt</b></font>). It's
my doom, and I can't help it.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Aunt Carrol/Aunt</b></font>)</div><p/>They found Aunt Carrol with the old lady, both absorbed in some very
interesting subject, but they dropped it as the girls came in, with a
conscious look which betrayed that they had been talking about their
nieces. Jo was not in a good humor, and the perverse fit returned, but
Amy, who had virtuously done her (<font color='blue'><b>Amy</b></font>) duty, kept her (<font color='blue'><b>Amy</b></font>) temper and pleased
everybody, was in a most angelic frame of mind. This amiable spirit
was felt at once, and both aunts `my deared' her (<font color='blue'><b>Amy</b></font>) affectionately,
looking what they afterward said emphatically, <div class="bookquote">``That child improves
every day.''

 (<font color='red'><b>both aunts</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Are you going to help about the fair, dear?''  (<font color='red'><b>Mrs. Carrol/Carrol</b></font>)</div>asked Mrs. Carrol, as Amy
sat down beside her (<font color='blue'><b>Amy</b></font>) with the confiding air elderly people like so well
in the young.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Yes, Aunt. Mrs. Chester asked me if I would, and I offered to tend a
table, as I have nothing but my time to give.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I'm not,''  (<font color='red'><b>Jo/Miss Jo/JO</b></font>)</div>put in Jo decidedly. <div class="bookquote">``I hate to be patronized, and the
Chesters think it's a great favor to allow us to help with their highly
connected fair. I wonder you consented, Amy, they only want you to
work.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I am willing to work. It's for the freedmen as well as the Chesters,
and I think it very kind of them to let me share the labor and the fun.
Patronage does not trouble me when it is well meant.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Quite right and proper. I like your grateful spirit, my dear. It's a
pleasure to help people who appreciate our efforts. Some do not, and
that is trying,''  (<font color='red'><b>Aunt</b></font>)</div>observed Aunt March, looking over her (<font color='blue'><b>Aunt</b></font>) spectacles at
Jo, who sat apart, rocking herself, with a somewhat morose expression.

<p/>If Jo had only known what a great happiness was wavering in the balance
for one of them, she (<font color='blue'><b>Jo</b></font>) would have turned dove-like in a minute, but
unfortunately, we don't have windows in our breasts, and cannot see
what goes on in the minds of our friends. Better for us that we cannot
as a general thing, but now and then it would be such a comfort, such a
saving of time and temper. By her (<font color='blue'><b>Jo</b></font>) next speech, Jo deprived herself of
several years of pleasure, and received a timely lesson in the art of
holding her (<font color='blue'><b>Jo</b></font>) tongue.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``I don't like favors, they oppress and make me feel like a slave. I'd
rather do everything for myself, and be perfectly independent.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Ahem!''  (<font color='red'><b>Aunt Carrol/Aunt</b></font>)</div>coughed Aunt Carrol softly, with a look at Aunt March.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``I told you so,''  (<font color='red'><b>Aunt</b></font>)</div>said Aunt March, with a decided nod to Aunt Carrol.

<p/>Mercifully unconscious of what she (<font color='blue'><b>Aunt</b></font>) had done, Jo sat with her (<font color='blue'><b>Jo</b></font>) nose in
the air, and a revolutionary aspect which was anything but inviting.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Do you speak French, dear?''  (<font color='red'><b>Mrs. Carrol/Carrol</b></font>)</div>asked Mrs. Carrol, laying a hand on Amy's.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Pretty well, thanks to Aunt March, who lets Esther talk to me as often
as I like,''  (<font color='red'><b>Amy/Amy March</b></font>)</div>replied Amy, with a grateful look, which caused the old
lady to smile affably.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``How are you about languages?''  (<font color='red'><b>Jo</b></font>)</div>asked Mrs. Carrol of Jo.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Don't know a word. I'm very stupid about studying anything, can't
bear French, it's such a slippery, silly sort of language,''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>was the
brusque reply.

<p/>Another look passed between the ladies, and Aunt March said to Amy,
<div class="bookquote">``You are quite strong and well now, dear, I believe? Eyes don't
trouble you any more, do they?''

 (<font color='red'><b>Amy/Amy March</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Not at all, thank you, ma'am. I'm very well, and mean to do great
things next winter, so that I may be ready for Rome, whenever that
joyful time arrives.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Good girl! You deserve to go, and I'm sure you will some day,''  (<font color='red'><b>Aunt</b></font>)</div>said
Aunt March, with an approving pat on the head, as Amy picked up her (<font color='blue'><b>Amy</b></font>)
ball for her (<font color='blue'><b>Amy</b></font>).

<p/>Crosspatch, draw the latch,
Sit by the fire and spin,

<p/>squalled Polly, bending down from his (<font color='blue'><b>Polly</b></font>) perch on the back of her (<font color='blue'><b>Polly</b></font>) chair to
peep into Jo's face, with such a comical air of impertinent inquiry
that it was impossible to help laughing.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Most observing bird,''  (<font color='red'><b>the lady</b></font>)</div>said the old lady.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Come and take a walk, my dear?''  (<font color='red'><b>Polly</b></font>)</div>cried Polly, hopping toward the china
closet, with a look suggestive of a lump of sugar.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Thank you, I will. Come Amy.''  (<font color='red'><b>Jo/Miss Jo/JO</b></font>)</div>and Jo brought the visit to an end,
feeling more strongly than ever that calls did have a bad effect upon
her (<font color='blue'><b>Jo</b></font>) constitution. She (<font color='blue'><b>Jo</b></font>) shook hands in a gentlemanly manner, but Amy
kissed both the aunts, and the girls departed, leaving behind them the
impression of shadow and sunshine, which impression caused Aunt March
to say, as they vanished...

<p/><div class="bookquote">``You'd better do it, Mary. I'll supply the money.''  (<font color='red'><b>Aunt</b></font>)</div>and Aunt Carrol to
reply decidedly, <div class="bookquote">``I certainly will, if her (<font color='blue'><b>Mary</b></font>) father and mother consent.''



 (<font color='red'><b>Aunt Carrol/Aunt</b></font>)</div><p/>CHAPTER THIRTY

<p/>CONSEQUENCES

<p/>Mrs. Chester's fair was so very elegant and select that it was
considered a great honor by the young ladies of the neighborhood to be
invited to take a table, and everyone was much interested in the
matter. Amy was asked, but Jo was not, which was fortunate for all
parties, as her (<font color='blue'><b>Amy</b></font>) elbows were decidedly akimbo at this period of her (<font color='blue'><b>Amy</b></font>)
life, and it took a good many hard knocks to teach her (<font color='blue'><b>Amy</b></font>) how to get on
easily. The `haughty, uninteresting creature' was let severely alone,
but Amy's talent and taste were duly complimented by the offer of the
art table, and she (<font color='blue'><b>Amy</b></font>) exerted herself to prepare and secure appropriate
and valuable contributions to it.

<p/>Everything went on smoothly till the day before the fair opened, then
there occurred one of the little skirmishes which it is almost
impossible to avoid, when some five-and-twenty women, old and young,
with all their private piques and prejudices, try to work together.

<p/>May Chester was rather jealous of Amy because the latter was a greater
favorite than herself, and just at this time several trifling
circumstances occurred to increase the feeling. Amy's dainty
pen-and-ink work entirely eclipsed May's painted vases--that was one
thorn. Then the all conquering Tudor had danced four times with Amy at
a late party and only once with May--that was thorn number two. But
the chief grievance that rankled in her (<font color='blue'><b>Amy</b></font>) soul, and gave an excuse for
her (<font color='blue'><b>Amy</b></font>) unfriendly conduct, was a rumor which some obliging gossip had
whispered to her (<font color='blue'><b>Amy</b></font>), that the March girls had made fun of her (<font color='blue'><b>Amy</b></font>) at the
Lambs'. All the blame of this should have fallen upon Jo, for her (<font color='blue'><b>Jo</b></font>)
naughty imitation had been too lifelike to escape detection, and the
frolicsome Lambs had permitted the joke to escape. No hint of this had
reached the culprits, however, and Amy's dismay can be imagined, when,
the very evening before the fair, as she (<font color='blue'><b>Amy</b></font>) was putting the last touches
to her (<font color='blue'><b>Amy</b></font>) pretty table, Mrs. Chester, who, of course, resented the
supposed ridicule of her (<font color='blue'><b>Chester</b></font>) daughter, said, in a bland tone, but with a
cold look...

<p/><div class="bookquote">``I find, dear, that there is some feeling among the young ladies about
my giving this table to anyone but my girls. As this is the most
prominent, and some say the most attractive table of all, and they are
the chief getters-up of the fair, it is thought best for them to take
this place. I'm sorry, but I know you are too sincerely interested in
the cause to mind a little personal disappointment, and you shall have
another table if you like.''

 (<font color='red'><b>daughter</b></font>)</div><p/>Mrs. Chester fancied beforehand that it would be easy to deliver this
little speech, but when the time came, she (<font color='blue'><b>Chester</b></font>) found it rather difficult to
utter it naturally, with Amy's unsuspicious eyes looking straight at
her (<font color='blue'><b>Amy</b></font>) full of surprise and trouble.

<p/>Amy felt that there was something behind this, but could not guess
what, and said quietly, feeling hurt, and showing that she (<font color='blue'><b>Amy</b></font>) did,
<div class="bookquote">``Perhaps you had rather I took no table at all?''

 (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Now, my dear, don't have any ill feeling, I beg. It's merely a matter
of expediency, you see, my girls will naturally take the lead, and this
table is considered their proper place. I think it very appropriate to
you, and feel very grateful for your efforts to make it so pretty, but
we must give up our private wishes, of course, and I will see that you
have a good place elsewhere. Wouldn't you like the flower table? The
little girls undertook it, but they are discouraged. You could make a
charming thing of it, and the flower table is always attractive you
know.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Especially to gentlemen,''  (<font color='red'><b>Amy/Amy March</b></font>)</div>added May, with a look which enlightened Amy
as to one cause of her (<font color='blue'><b>Amy</b></font>) sudden fall from favor. She (<font color='blue'><b>Amy</b></font>) colored angrily,
but took no other notice of that girlish sarcasm, and answered with
unexpected amiability...

<p/><div class="bookquote">``It shall be as you please, Mrs. Chester. I'll give up my place here
at once, and attend to the flowers, if you like.''

 (<font color='red'><b>She</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``You can put your own things on your own table, if you prefer,''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>began
May, feeling a little conscience-stricken, as she (<font color='blue'><b>Amy</b></font>) looked at the pretty
racks, the painted shells, and quaint illuminations Amy had so
carefully made and so gracefully arranged. She (<font color='blue'><b>Amy</b></font>) meant it kindly, but
Amy mistook her (<font color='blue'><b>Amy</b></font>) meaning, and said quickly...

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Oh, certainly, if they are in your way,''  (<font color='red'><b>Amy/Amy March</b></font>)</div>and sweeping her (<font color='blue'><b>Amy</b></font>)
contributions into her (<font color='blue'><b>Amy</b></font>) apron, pell-mell, she (<font color='blue'><b>Amy</b></font>) walked off, feeling that
herself and her (<font color='blue'><b>Amy</b></font>) works of art had been insulted past forgiveness.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Now she (<font color='blue'><b>Chester</b></font>)'s mad. Oh, dear, I wish I hadn't asked you to speak, Mama,''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>said May, looking disconsolately at the empty spaces on her (<font color='blue'><b>Amy</b></font>) table.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Girls' quarrels are soon over,''  (<font color='red'><b>mother</b></font>)</div>returned her (<font color='blue'><b>Amy</b></font>) mother, feeling a trifle
ashamed of her (<font color='blue'><b>Amy</b></font>) own part in this one, as well she (<font color='blue'><b>Amy</b></font>) might.

<p/>The little girls hailed Amy and her (<font color='blue'><b>Amy</b></font>) treasures with delight, which
cordial reception somewhat soothed her (<font color='blue'><b>Amy</b></font>) perturbed spirit, and she (<font color='blue'><b>Amy</b></font>) fell
to work, determined to succeed florally, if she (<font color='blue'><b>Amy</b></font>) could not artistically.
But everything seemed against her (<font color='blue'><b>Amy</b></font>). It was late, and she (<font color='blue'><b>Amy</b></font>) was tired.
Everyone was too busy with their own affairs to help her (<font color='blue'><b>Amy</b></font>), and the
little girls were only hindrances, for the dears fussed and chattered
like so many magpies, making a great deal of confusion in their artless
efforts to preserve the most perfect order. The evergreen arch
wouldn't stay firm after she (<font color='blue'><b>Amy</b></font>) got it up, but wiggled and threatened to
tumble down on her (<font color='blue'><b>Amy</b></font>) head when the hanging baskets were filled. Her (<font color='blue'><b>Amy</b></font>) best
tile got a splash of water, which left a sepia tear on the Cupid's
cheek. She (<font color='blue'><b>Amy</b></font>) bruised her (<font color='blue'><b>Amy</b></font>) hands with hammering, and got cold working in a
draft, which last affliction filled her (<font color='blue'><b>Amy</b></font>) with apprehensions for the
morrow. Any girl reader who has suffered like afflictions will
sympathize with poor Amy and wish her (<font color='blue'><b>Amy</b></font>) well through her (<font color='blue'><b>Amy</b></font>) task.

<p/>There was great indignation at home when she (<font color='blue'><b>Amy</b></font>) told her (<font color='blue'><b>Amy</b></font>) story that
evening. Her (<font color='blue'><b>Amy</b></font>) mother said it was a shame, but told her (<font color='blue'><b>Amy</b></font>) she (<font color='blue'><b>Amy</b></font>) had done
right. Beth declared she (<font color='blue'><b>Beth</b></font>) wouldn't go to the fair at all, and Jo
demanded why she (<font color='blue'><b>Jo</b></font>) didn't take all her (<font color='blue'><b>Jo</b></font>) pretty things and leave those mean
people to get on without her (<font color='blue'><b>Jo</b></font>).

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Because they are mean is no reason why I should be. I hate such
things, and though I think I've a right to be hurt, I don't intend to
show it. They will feel that more than angry speeches or huffy
actions, won't they, Marmee?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``That's the right spirit, my dear. A kiss for a blow is always best,
though it's not very easy to give it sometimes,''  (<font color='red'><b>mother</b></font>)</div>said her (<font color='blue'><b>Jo</b></font>) mother, with
the air of one who had learned the difference between preaching and
practicing.

<p/>In spite of various very natural temptations to resent and retaliate,
Amy adhered to her (<font color='blue'><b>Amy</b></font>) resolution all the next day, bent on conquering her (<font color='blue'><b>Amy</b></font>)
enemy by kindness. She (<font color='blue'><b>Amy</b></font>) began well, thanks to a silent reminder that
came to her (<font color='blue'><b>Amy</b></font>) unexpectedly, but most opportunely. As she (<font color='blue'><b>Amy</b></font>) arranged her (<font color='blue'><b>Amy</b></font>)
table that morning, while the little girls were in the anteroom filling
the baskets, she (<font color='blue'><b>Amy</b></font>) took up her (<font color='blue'><b>Amy</b></font>) pet production, a little book, the antique
cover of which her (<font color='blue'><b>Amy</b></font>) father had found among his (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) treasures, and in which
on leaves of vellum she (<font color='blue'><b>Amy</b></font>) had beautifully illuminated different texts.
As she (<font color='blue'><b>Amy</b></font>) turned the pages rich in dainty devices with very pardonable
pride, her (<font color='blue'><b>Amy</b></font>) eye fell upon one verse that made her (<font color='blue'><b>Amy</b></font>) stop and think.
Framed in a brilliant scrollwork of scarlet, blue and gold, with little
spirits of good will helping one another up and down among the thorns
and flowers, were the words, <div class="bookquote">``Thou shalt love thy neighbor as thyself.''

 (<font color='red'><b>spirits</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I ought, but I don't,''  (<font color='red'><b>Amy/Amy March</b></font>)</div>thought Amy, as her (<font color='blue'><b>Amy</b></font>) eye went from the bright
page to May's discontented face behind the big vases, that could not
hide the vacancies her (<font color='blue'><b>Amy</b></font>) pretty work had once filled. Amy stood a
minute, turning the leaves in her (<font color='blue'><b>Amy</b></font>) hand, reading on each some sweet
rebuke for all heartburnings and uncharitableness of spirit. Many wise
and true sermons are preached us every day by unconscious ministers in
street, school, office, or home. Even a fair table may become a
pulpit, if it can offer the good and helpful words which are never out
of season. Amy's conscience preached her (<font color='blue'><b>Amy</b></font>) a little sermon from that
text, then and there, and she (<font color='blue'><b>Amy</b></font>) did what many of us do not always do,
took the sermon to heart, and straightway put it in practice.

<p/>A group of girls were standing about May's table, admiring the pretty
things, and talking over the change of saleswomen. They dropped their
voices, but Amy knew they were speaking of her (<font color='blue'><b>Amy</b></font>), hearing one side of the
story and judging accordingly. It was not pleasant, but a better
spirit had come over her (<font color='blue'><b>Amy</b></font>), and presently a chance offered for proving
it. She (<font color='blue'><b>Amy</b></font>) heard May say sorrowfully...

<p/><div class="bookquote">``It's too bad, for there is no time to make other things, and I don't
want to fill up with odds and ends. The table was just complete then.
Now it's spoiled.''

 (<font color='red'><b>She</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I dare say she (<font color='blue'><b>Marmee</b></font>)'d put them back if you asked her (<font color='blue'><b>Marmee</b></font>),''  (<font color='red'><b>someone</b></font>)</div>suggested someone.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``How could I after all the fuss?''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>began May, but she (<font color='blue'><b>Amy</b></font>) did not finish,
for Amy's voice came across the hall, saying pleasantly...

<p/><div class="bookquote">``You may have them, and welcome, without asking, if you want them. I
was just thinking I'd offer to put them back, for they belong to your
table rather than mine. Here they are, please take them, and forgive
me if I was hasty in carrying them away last night.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Amy/Amy March</b></font>)</div><p/>As she (<font color='blue'><b>Amy</b></font>) spoke, Amy returned her (<font color='blue'><b>Amy</b></font>) contribution, with a nod and a smile,
and hurried away again, feeling that it was easier to do a friendly
thing than it was to stay and be thanked for it.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Now, I call that lovely of her (<font color='blue'><b>Marmee</b></font>), don't you?''  (<font color='red'><b>girl</b></font>)</div>cried one girl.

<p/>May's answer was inaudible, but another young lady, whose temper was
evidently a little soured by making lemonade, added, with a
disagreeable laugh, <div class="bookquote">``Very lovely, for she (<font color='blue'><b>Marmee</b></font>) knew she (<font color='blue'><b>Marmee</b></font>) wouldn't sell them
at her (<font color='blue'><b>Marmee</b></font>) own table.''

 (<font color='red'><b>another lady</b></font>)</div><p/>Now, that was hard. When we make little sacrifices we like to have
them appreciated, at least, and for a minute Amy was sorry she (<font color='blue'><b>Amy</b></font>) had done
it, feeling that virtue was not always its own reward. But it is, as
she (<font color='blue'><b>Amy</b></font>) presently discovered, for her (<font color='blue'><b>Amy</b></font>) spirits began to rise, and her (<font color='blue'><b>Amy</b></font>) table
to blossom under her (<font color='blue'><b>Amy</b></font>) skillful hands, the girls were very kind, and that
one little act seemed to have cleared the atmosphere amazingly.

<p/>It was a very long day and a hard one for Amy, as she (<font color='blue'><b>Amy</b></font>) sat behind her (<font color='blue'><b>Amy</b></font>)
table, often quite alone, for the little girls deserted very soon. Few
cared to buy flowers in summer, and her (<font color='blue'><b>Amy</b></font>) bouquets began to droop long
before night.

<p/>The art table was the most attractive in the room. There was a crowd
about it all day long, and the tenders were constantly flying to and
fro with important faces and rattling money boxes. Amy often looked
wistfully across, longing to be there, where she (<font color='blue'><b>Amy</b></font>) felt at home and
happy, instead of in a corner with nothing to do. It might seem no
hardship to some of us, but to a pretty, blithe young girl, it was not
only tedious, but very trying, and the thought of Laurie and his (<font color='blue'><b>Laurie</b></font>)
friends made it a real martyrdom.

<p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) did not go home till night, and then she (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) looked so pale and quiet
that they knew the day had been a hard one, though she (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) made no
complaint, and did not even tell what she (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) had done. Her (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) mother gave
her (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) an extra cordial cup of tea. Beth helped her (<font color='blue'><b>Beth</b></font>) dress, and made a
charming little wreath for her (<font color='blue'><b>Beth</b></font>) hair, while Jo astonished her (<font color='blue'><b>Jo</b></font>) family by
getting herself up with unusual care, and hinting darkly that the
tables were about to be turned.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Don't do anything rude, pray Jo; I won't have any fuss made, so let it
all pass and behave yourself,''  (<font color='red'><b>Amy/Amy March</b></font>)</div>begged Amy, as she (<font color='blue'><b>Amy</b></font>) departed early,
hoping to find a reinforcement of flowers to refresh her (<font color='blue'><b>Amy</b></font>) poor little
table.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``I merely intend to make myself entrancingly agreeable to every one I
know, and to keep them in your corner as long as possible. Teddy and
his (<font color='blue'><b>Teddy</b></font>) boys will lend a hand, and we'll have a good time yet.''  (<font color='red'><b>Jo/Miss Jo/JO</b></font>)</div>returned
Jo, leaning over the gate to watch for Laurie. Presently the familiar
tramp was heard in the dusk, and she (<font color='blue'><b>Jo</b></font>) ran out to meet him (<font color='blue'><b>tramp</b></font>).

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Is that my boy?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``As sure as this is my girl!''  (<font color='red'><b>Laurie/Mr. Laurie/LAURIE</b></font>)</div>and Laurie tucked her (<font color='blue'><b>Jo</b></font>) hand under his (<font color='blue'><b>Laurie</b></font>) arm
with the air of a man whose every wish was gratified.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Oh, Teddy, such doings!''  (<font color='red'><b>Jo/Miss Jo/JO</b></font>)</div>and Jo told Amy's wrongs with sisterly zeal.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``A flock of our fellows are going to drive over by-and-by, and I'll be
hanged if I don't make them buy every flower she (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>)'s got, and camp down
before her (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) table afterward,''  (<font color='red'><b>Laurie/Mr. Laurie/LAURIE</b></font>)</div>said Laurie, espousing her (<font color='blue'><b>Jo</b></font>) cause with
warmth.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``The flowers are not at all nice, Amy says, and the fresh ones may not
arrive in time. I don't wish to be unjust or suspicious, but I
shouldn't wonder if they never came at all. When people do one mean
thing they are very likely to do another,''  (<font color='red'><b>Jo/Miss Jo/JO</b></font>)</div>observed Jo in a disgusted
tone.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Didn't Hayes give you the best out of our gardens? I told him (<font color='blue'><b>Hayes</b></font>) to.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I didn't know that, he (<font color='blue'><b>Hayes</b></font>) forgot, I suppose, and, as your grandpa was
poorly, I didn't like to worry him (<font color='blue'><b>Hayes</b></font>) by asking, though I did want some.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Now, Jo, how could you think there was any need of asking? They are
just as much yours as mine. Don't we always go halves in everything?''
 (<font color='red'><b>Laurie/Mr. Laurie/LAURIE</b></font>)</div>began Laurie, in the tone that always made Jo turn thorny.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Gracious, I hope not! Half of some of your things wouldn't suit me at
all. But we mustn't stand philandering here. I've got to help Amy, so
you go and make yourself splendid, and if you'll be so very kind as to
let Hayes take a few nice flowers up to the Hall, I'll bless you
forever.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Couldn't you do it now?''  (<font color='red'><b>Laurie/Mr. Laurie/LAURIE</b></font>)</div>asked Laurie, so suggestively that Jo shut
the gate in his (<font color='blue'><b>Laurie</b></font>) face with inhospitable haste, and called through the
bars, <div class="bookquote">``Go away, Teddy, I'm busy.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Jo/Miss Jo/JO</b></font>)</div><p/>Thanks to the conspirators, the tables were turned that night, for
Hayes sent up a wilderness of flowers, with a loverly basket arranged
in his (<font color='blue'><b>Hayes</b></font>) best manner for a centerpiece. Then the March family turned out
en masse, and Jo exerted herself to some purpose, for people not only
came, but stayed, laughing at her (<font color='blue'><b>Jo</b></font>) nonsense, admiring Amy's taste, and
apparently enjoying themselves very much. Laurie and his (<font color='blue'><b>Laurie</b></font>) friends
gallantly threw themselves into the breach, bought up the bouquets,
encamped before the table, and made that corner the liveliest spot in
the room. Amy was in her (<font color='blue'><b>Amy</b></font>) element now, and out of gratitude, if nothing
more, was as spritely and gracious as possible, coming to the
conclusion, about that time, that virtue was its own reward, after all.

<p/>Jo behaved herself with exemplary propriety, and when Amy was happily
surrounded by her (<font color='blue'><b>Amy</b></font>) guard of honor, Jo circulated about the Hall, picking
up various bits of gossip, which enlightened her (<font color='blue'><b>Jo</b></font>) upon the subject of
the Chester change of base. She (<font color='blue'><b>Chester</b></font>) reproached herself for her (<font color='blue'><b>Chester</b></font>) share of
the ill feeling and resolved to exonerate Amy as soon as possible. She (<font color='blue'><b>Amy</b></font>)
also discovered what Amy had done about the things in the morning, and
considered her (<font color='blue'><b>Amy</b></font>) a model of magnanimity. As she (<font color='blue'><b>Amy</b></font>) passed the art table,
she (<font color='blue'><b>Amy</b></font>) glanced over it for her (<font color='blue'><b>Amy</b></font>) sister's things, but saw no sign of them.
<div class="bookquote">``Tucked away out of sight, I dare say,''  (<font color='red'><b>Jo/Miss Jo/JO</b></font>)</div>thought Jo, who could forgive
her (<font color='blue'><b>Jo</b></font>) own wrongs, but hotly resented any insult offered her (<font color='blue'><b>Jo</b></font>) family.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Good evening, Miss Jo. How does Amy get on?''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>asked May with a
conciliatory air, for she (<font color='blue'><b>Jo</b></font>) wanted to show that she (<font color='blue'><b>Jo</b></font>) also could be
generous.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``She (<font color='blue'><b>Amy</b></font>) has sold everything she (<font color='blue'><b>Amy</b></font>) had that was worth selling, and now she (<font color='blue'><b>Amy</b></font>) is
enjoying herself. The flower table is always attractive, you know,
`especially to gentlemen'.''  (<font color='red'><b>Jo/Miss Jo/JO</b></font>)</div>Jo couldn't resist giving that little slap,
but May took it so meekly she (<font color='blue'><b>Jo</b></font>) regretted it a minute after, and fell to
praising the great vases, which still remained unsold.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Is Amy's illumination anywhere about? I took a fancy to buy that for
Father,''  (<font color='red'><b>Jo/Miss Jo/JO</b></font>)</div>said Jo, very anxious to learn the fate of her (<font color='blue'><b>Jo</b></font>) sister's work.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Everything of Amy's sold long ago. I took care that the right people
saw them, and they made a nice little sum of money for us,''  (<font color='red'><b>Amy/Amy March</b></font>)</div>returned
May, who had overcome sundry small temptations, as well as Amy had,
that day.

<p/>Much gratified, Jo rushed back to tell the good news, and Amy looked
both touched and surprised by the report of May's word and manner.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Now, gentlemen, I want you to go and do your duty by the other tables
as generously as you have by mine, especially the art table,''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Amy</b></font>) said,
ordering out ``Teddy's own', as the girls called the college friends.

<p/><div class="bookquote">''`Charge, Chester, charge!''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>is the motto for that table, but do your
duty like men, and you'll get your money's worth of art in every sense
of the word,'' said the irrepressible Jo, as the devoted phalanx
prepared to take the field.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``To hear is to obey, but March is fairer far than May,''  (<font color='red'><b>Parker</b></font>)</div>said little
Parker, making a frantic effort to be both witty and tender, and
getting promptly quenched by Laurie, who said...

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Very well, my son, for a small boy!''  (<font color='red'><b>Laurie/Mr. Laurie/LAURIE</b></font>)</div>and walked him (<font color='blue'><b>Laurie</b></font>) off, with a
paternal pat on the head.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Buy the vases,''  (<font color='red'><b>Amy/Amy March</b></font>)</div>whispered Amy to Laurie, as a final heaping of coals
of fire on her (<font color='blue'><b>Amy</b></font>) enemy's head.

<p/>To May's great delight, Mr. Laurence not only bought the vases, but
pervaded the hall with one under each arm. The other gentlemen
speculated with equal rashness in all sorts of frail trifles, and
wandered helplessly about afterward, burdened with wax flowers, painted
fans, filigree portfolios, and other useful and appropriate purchases.

<p/>Aunt Carrol was there, heard the story, looked pleased, and said
something to Mrs. March in a corner, which made the latter lady beam
with satisfaction, and watch Amy with a face full of mingled pride and
anxiety, though she (<font color='blue'><b>Amy</b></font>) did not betray the cause of her (<font color='blue'><b>Amy</b></font>) pleasure till
several days later.

<p/>The fair was pronounced a success, and when May bade Amy goodnight, she (<font color='blue'><b>Amy</b></font>)
did not gush as usual, but gave her (<font color='blue'><b>Amy</b></font>) an affectionate kiss, and a look
which said `forgive and forget'. That satisfied Amy, and when she (<font color='blue'><b>Amy</b></font>) got
home she (<font color='blue'><b>Amy</b></font>) found the vases paraded on the parlor chimney piece with a
great bouquet in each. <div class="bookquote">``The reward of merit for a magnanimous March,''
 (<font color='red'><b>Laurie/Mr. Laurie/LAURIE</b></font>)</div>as Laurie announced with a flourish.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``You've a deal more principle and generosity and nobleness of character
than I ever gave you credit for, Amy. You've behaved sweetly, and I
respect you with all my heart,''  (<font color='red'><b>Jo/Miss Jo/JO</b></font>)</div>said Jo warmly, as they brushed their
hair together late that night.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Yes, we all do, and love her (<font color='blue'><b>Amy</b></font>) for being so ready to forgive. It must
have been dreadfully hard, after working so long and setting your heart
on selling your own pretty things. I don't believe I could have done
it as kindly as you did,''  (<font color='red'><b>Beth</b></font>)</div>added Beth from her (<font color='blue'><b>Beth</b></font>) pillow.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Why, girls, you needn't praise me so. I only did as I'd be done by.
You laugh at me when I say I want to be a lady, but I mean a true
gentlewoman in mind and manners, and I try to do it as far as I know
how. I can't explain exactly, but I want to be above the little
meannesses and follies and faults that spoil so many women. I'm far
from it now, but I do my best, and hope in time to be what Mother is.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Amy/Amy March</b></font>)</div><p/>Amy spoke earnestly, and Jo said, with a cordial hug, <div class="bookquote">``I understand now
what you mean, and I'll never laugh at you again. You are getting on
faster than you think, and I'll take lessons of you in true politeness,
for you've learned the secret, I believe. Try away, deary, you'll get
your reward some day, and no one will be more delighted than I shall.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Jo/Miss Jo/JO</b></font>)</div><p/>A week later Amy did get her (<font color='blue'><b>Amy</b></font>) reward, and poor Jo found it hard to be
delighted. A letter came from Aunt Carrol, and Mrs. March's face was
illuminated to such a degree when she (<font color='blue'><b>Amy</b></font>) read it that Jo and Beth, who
were with her (<font color='blue'><b>Jo</b></font>), demanded what the glad tidings were.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Aunt Carrol is going abroad next month, and wants...''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Me to go with her (<font color='blue'><b>Mother</b></font>)!''  (<font color='red'><b>Jo/Miss Jo/JO</b></font>)</div>burst in Jo, flying out of her (<font color='blue'><b>Jo</b></font>) chair in an
uncontrollable rapture.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``No, dear, not you. It's Amy.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Oh, Mother! She (<font color='blue'><b>Amy</b></font>)'s too young, it's my turn first. I've wanted it so
long. It would do me so much good, and be so altogether splendid. I
must go!''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I'm afraid it's impossible, Jo. Aunt says Amy, decidedly, and it is
not for us to dictate when she (<font color='blue'><b>Aunt</b></font>) offers such a favor.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``It's always so. Amy has all the fun and I have all the work. It isn't
fair, oh, it isn't fair!''  (<font color='red'><b>Jo/Miss Jo/JO</b></font>)</div>cried Jo passionately.

<p/>``I'm afraid it's partly your own fault, dear. When Aunt spoke to me
the other day, she (<font color='blue'><b>Aunt</b></font>) regretted your blunt manners and too independent
spirit, and here she (<font color='blue'><b>Aunt</b></font>) writes, as if quoting something you had said--<div class="bookquote">``I
planned at first to ask Jo, but as `favors burden her (<font color='blue'><b>Jo</b></font>)', and she (<font color='blue'><b>Jo</b></font>) `hates
French', I think I won't venture to invite her (<font color='blue'><b>Jo</b></font>). Amy is more docile,
will make a good companion for Flo, and receive gratefully any help the
trip may give her (<font color='blue'><b>Amy</b></font>).''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Oh, my tongue, my abominable tongue! Why can't I learn to keep it
quiet?''  (<font color='red'><b>Jo/Miss Jo/JO</b></font>)</div>groaned Jo, remembering words which had been her (<font color='blue'><b>Jo</b></font>) undoing. When
she (<font color='blue'><b>Jo</b></font>) had heard the explanation of the quoted phrases, Mrs. March said
sorrowfully...

<p/><div class="bookquote">``I wish you could have gone, but there is no hope of it this time, so
try to bear it cheerfully, and don't sadden Amy's pleasure by
reproaches or regrets.''

 (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I'll try,''  (<font color='red'><b>Jo/Miss Jo/JO</b></font>)</div>said Jo, winking hard as she (<font color='blue'><b>Jo</b></font>) knelt down to pick up the
basket she (<font color='blue'><b>Jo</b></font>) had joyfully upset. <div class="bookquote">``I'll take a leaf out of her (<font color='blue'><b>Amy</b></font>) book, and
try not only to seem glad, but to be so, and not grudge her (<font color='blue'><b>Amy</b></font>) one minute
of happiness. But it won't be easy, for it is a dreadful
disappointment,''  (<font color='red'><b>Jo/Miss Jo/JO</b></font>)</div>and poor Jo bedewed the little fat pincushion she (<font color='blue'><b>Jo</b></font>) held
with several very bitter tears.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Jo, dear, I'm very selfish, but I couldn't spare you, and I'm glad you
are not going quite yet,''  (<font color='red'><b>Beth</b></font>)</div>whispered Beth, embracing her (<font color='blue'><b>Jo</b></font>), basket and
all, with such a clinging touch and loving face that Jo felt comforted
in spite of the sharp regret that made her (<font color='blue'><b>Jo</b></font>) want to box her (<font color='blue'><b>Jo</b></font>) own ears,
and humbly beg Aunt Carrol to burden her (<font color='blue'><b>Jo</b></font>) with this favor, and see how
gratefully she (<font color='blue'><b>Jo</b></font>) would bear it.

<p/>By the time Amy came in, Jo was able to take her (<font color='blue'><b>Jo</b></font>) part in the family
jubilation, not quite as heartily as usual, perhaps, but without
repinings at Amy's good fortune. The young lady herself received the
news as tidings of great joy, went about in a solemn sort of rapture,
and began to sort her (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) colors and pack her (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) pencils that evening, leaving
such trifles as clothes, money, and passports to those less absorbed in
visions of art than herself.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``It isn't a mere pleasure trip to me, girls,''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) said impressively, as
she (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) scraped her (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) best palette. <div class="bookquote">``It will decide my career, for if I have
any genius, I shall find it out in Rome, and will do something to prove
it.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Suppose you haven't?''  (<font color='red'><b>Jo/Miss Jo/JO</b></font>)</div>said Jo, sewing away, with red eyes, at the new
collars which were to be handed over to Amy.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Then I shall come home and teach drawing for my living,''  (<font color='red'><b>the aspirant</b></font>)</div>replied the
aspirant for fame, with philosophic composure. But she (<font color='blue'><b>Amy</b></font>) made a wry face
at the prospect, and scratched away at her (<font color='blue'><b>Amy</b></font>) palette as if bent on
vigorous measures before she (<font color='blue'><b>Amy</b></font>) gave up her (<font color='blue'><b>Amy</b></font>) hopes.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``No, you won't. You hate hard work, and you'll marry some rich man,
and come home to sit in the lap of luxury all your days,''  (<font color='red'><b>Jo/Miss Jo/JO</b></font>)</div>said Jo.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Your predictions sometimes come to pass, but I don't believe that one
will. I'm sure I wish it would, for if I can't be an artist myself, I
should like to be able to help those who are,''  (<font color='red'><b>Amy/Amy March</b></font>)</div>said Amy, smiling, as if
the part of Lady Bountiful would suit her (<font color='blue'><b>Jo</b></font>) better than that of a poor
drawing teacher.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Hum!''  (<font color='red'><b>Jo/Miss Jo/JO</b></font>)</div>said Jo, with a sigh. <div class="bookquote">``If you wish it you'll have it, for your
wishes are always granted--mine never.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Would you like to go?''  (<font color='red'><b>Amy/Amy March</b></font>)</div>asked Amy, thoughtfully patting her (<font color='blue'><b>Jo</b></font>) nose with
her (<font color='blue'><b>Jo</b></font>) knife.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Rather!''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Well, in a year or two I'll send for you, and we'll dig in the Forum
for relics, and carry out all the plans we've made so many times.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Thank you. I'll remind you of your promise when that joyful day
comes, if it ever does,''  (<font color='red'><b>Jo/Miss Jo/JO</b></font>)</div>returned Jo, accepting the vague but
magnificent offer as gratefully as she (<font color='blue'><b>Jo</b></font>) could.

<p/>There was not much time for preparation, and the house was in a ferment
till Amy was off. Jo bore up very well till the last flutter of blue
ribbon vanished, when she (<font color='blue'><b>Jo</b></font>) retired to her (<font color='blue'><b>Jo</b></font>) refuge, the garret, and cried
till she (<font color='blue'><b>Jo</b></font>) couldn't cry any more. Amy likewise bore up stoutly till the
steamer sailed. Then just as the gangway was about to be withdrawn, it
suddenly came over her (<font color='blue'><b>Amy</b></font>) that a whole ocean was soon to roll between her (<font color='blue'><b>Amy</b></font>)
and those who loved her (<font color='blue'><b>Amy</b></font>) best, and she (<font color='blue'><b>Amy</b></font>) clung to Laurie, the last
lingerer, saying with a sob...

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Oh, take care of them for me, and if anything should happen...''

 (<font color='red'><b>Laurie/Mr. Laurie/LAURIE</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I will, dear, I will, and if anything happens, I'll come and comfort
you,''  (<font color='red'><b>Laurie/Mr. Laurie/LAURIE</b></font>)</div>whispered Laurie, little dreaming that he (<font color='blue'><b>Laurie</b></font>) would be called upon to
keep his (<font color='blue'><b>Laurie</b></font>) word.

<p/>So Amy sailed away to find the Old World, which is always new and
beautiful to young eyes, while her (<font color='blue'><b>Amy</b></font>) father and friend watched her (<font color='blue'><b>Amy</b></font>) from
the shore, fervently hoping that none but gentle fortunes would befall
the happy-hearted girl, who waved her (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) hand to them till they could see
nothing but the summer sunshine dazzling on the sea.



<p/>CHAPTER THIRTY-ONE

<p/>OUR FOREIGN CORRESPONDENT

<p/>London

<p/>Dearest People, Here I really sit at a front window of the Bath Hotel,
Piccadilly. It's not a fashionable place, but Uncle stopped here years
ago, and won't go anywhere else. However, we don't mean to stay long,
so it's no great matter. Oh, I can't begin to tell you how I enjoy it
all! I never can, so I'll only give you bits out of my notebook, for
I've done nothing but sketch and scribble since I started.

<p/>I sent a line from Halifax, when I felt pretty miserable, but after
that I got on delightfully, seldom ill, on deck all day, with plenty of
pleasant people to amuse me. Everyone was very kind to me, especially
the officers. Don't laugh, Jo, gentlemen really are very necessary
aboard ship, to hold on to, or to wait upon one, and as they have
nothing to do, it's a mercy to make them useful, otherwise they would
smoke themselves to death, I'm afraid.

<p/>Aunt and Flo were poorly all the way, and liked to be let alone, so
when I had done what I could for them, I went and enjoyed myself. Such
walks on deck, such sunsets, such splendid air and waves! It was
almost as exciting as riding a fast horse, when we went rushing on so
grandly. I wish Beth could have come, it would have done her (<font color='blue'><b>Beth</b></font>) so much
good. As for Jo, she (<font color='blue'><b>Jo</b></font>) would have gone up and sat on the maintop jib, or
whatever the high thing is called, made friends with the engineers, and
tooted on the captain's speaking trumpet, she (<font color='blue'><b>Jo</b></font>)'d have been in such a
state of rapture.

<p/>It was all heavenly, but I was glad to see the Irish coast, and found
it very lovely, so green and sunny, with brown cabins here and there,
ruins on some of the hills, and gentlemen's countryseats in the
valleys, with deer feeding in the parks. It was early in the morning,
but I didn't regret getting up to see it, for the bay was full of
little boats, the shore so picturesque, and a rosy sky overhead. I
never shall forget it.

<p/>At Queenstown one of my new acquaintances left us, Mr. Lennox, and when
I said something about the Lakes of Killarney, he (<font color='blue'><b>Lennox</b></font>) sighed, and sung,
with a look at me...

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Oh, have you e'er heard of Kate Kearney?
She (<font color='blue'><b>Kearney</b></font>) lives on the banks of Killarney;
From the glance of her (<font color='blue'><b>Kearney</b></font>) eye,
Shun danger and fly,
For fatal's the glance of Kate Kearney.''

 (<font color='red'><b>me</b></font>)</div><p/>Wasn't that nonsensical?

<p/>We only stopped at Liverpool a few hours. It's a dirty, noisy place,
and I was glad to leave it. Uncle rushed out and bought a pair of
dogskin gloves, some ugly, thick shoes, and an umbrella, and got shaved
_à la_ mutton chop, the first thing. Then he (<font color='blue'><b>Uncle</b></font>) flattered himself that he (<font color='blue'><b>Uncle</b></font>)
looked like a true Briton, but the first time he (<font color='blue'><b>Uncle</b></font>) had the mud cleaned
off his (<font color='blue'><b>Uncle</b></font>) shoes, the little bootblack knew that an American stood in
them, and said, with a grin, <div class="bookquote">``There yer har, sir. I've given 'em the
latest Yankee shine.''  (<font color='red'><b>the bootblack</b></font>)</div>It amused Uncle immensely. Oh, I must tell you
what that absurd Lennox did! He (<font color='blue'><b>Lennox</b></font>) got his (<font color='blue'><b>Lennox</b></font>) friend Ward, who came on with
us, to order a bouquet for me, and the first thing I saw in my room was
a lovely one, with <div class="bookquote">``Robert Lennox's compliments,''  (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div>on the card. Wasn't
that fun, girls? I like traveling.

<p/>I never shall get to London if I don't hurry. The trip was like riding
through a long picture gallery, full of lovely landscapes. The
farmhouses were my delight, with thatched roofs, ivy up to the eaves,
latticed windows, and stout women with rosy children at the doors. The
very cattle looked more tranquil than ours, as they stood knee-deep in
clover, and the hens had a contented cluck, as if they never got
nervous like Yankee biddies. Such perfect color I never saw, the grass
so green, sky so blue, grain so yellow, woods so dark, I was in a
rapture all the way. So was Flo, and we kept bouncing from one side to
the other, trying to see everything while we were whisking along at the
rate of sixty miles an hour. Aunt was tired and went to sleep, but
Uncle read his (<font color='blue'><b>Uncle</b></font>) guidebook, and wouldn't be astonished at anything. This
is the way we went on. Amy, flying up--<div class="bookquote">``Oh, that must be Kenilworth,
that gray place among the trees!''  (<font color='red'><b>Amy/Amy March</b></font>)</div>Flo, darting to my window--<div class="bookquote">``How
sweet! We must go there sometime, won't we Papa?''  (<font color='red'><b>Flo</b></font>)</div>Uncle, calmly
admiring his (<font color='blue'><b>Uncle</b></font>) boots--<div class="bookquote">``No, my dear, not unless you want beer, that's a
brewery.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Uncle brewery</b></font>)</div><p/>A pause--then Flo cried out, <div class="bookquote">``Bless me, there's a gallows and a man
going up.''  (<font color='red'><b>Flo</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``Where, where?''  (<font color='red'><b>Amy/Amy March</b></font>)</div>shrieks Amy, staring out at two tall posts
with a crossbeam and some dangling chains. <div class="bookquote">``A colliery,''  (<font color='red'><b>Uncle</b></font>)</div>remarks
Uncle, with a twinkle of the eye. <div class="bookquote">``Here's a lovely flock of lambs all
lying down,''  (<font color='red'><b>Amy/Amy March</b></font>)</div>says Amy. <div class="bookquote">``See, Papa, aren't they pretty?''  (<font color='red'><b>Flo</b></font>)</div>added Flo
sentimentally. <div class="bookquote">``Geese, young ladies,''  (<font color='red'><b>Uncle</b></font>)</div>returns Uncle, in a tone that
keeps us quiet till Flo settles down to enjoy the _Flirtations of
Captain Cavendish_, and I have the scenery all to myself.

<p/>Of course it rained when we got to London, and there was nothing to be
seen but fog and umbrellas. We rested, unpacked, and shopped a little
between the showers. Aunt Mary got me some new things, for I came off
in such a hurry I wasn't half ready. A white hat and blue feather, a
muslin dress to match, and the loveliest mantle you ever saw. Shopping
in Regent Street is perfectly splendid. Things seem so cheap, nice
ribbons only sixpence a yard. I laid in a stock, but shall get my
gloves in Paris. Doesn't that sound sort of elegant and rich?

<p/>Flo and I, for the fun of it, ordered a hansom cab, while Aunt and
Uncle were out, and went for a drive, though we learned afterward that
it wasn't the thing for young ladies to ride in them alone. It was so
droll! For when we were shut in by the wooden apron, the man drove so
fast that Flo was frightened, and told me to stop him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>), but he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) was up
outside behind somewhere, and I couldn't get at him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>). He (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) didn't hear me
call, nor see me flap my parasol in front, and there we were, quite
helpless, rattling away, and whirling around corners at a breakneck
pace. At last, in my despair, I saw a little door in the roof, and on
poking it open, a red eye appeared, and a beery voice said...

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Now, then, mum?''

 (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div><p/>I gave my order as soberly as I could, and slamming down the door, with
an <div class="bookquote">``Aye, aye, mum,''  (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div>the man made his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) horse walk, as if going to a
funeral. I poked again and said, <div class="bookquote">``A little faster,''  (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div>then off he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) went,
helter-skelter as before, and we resigned ourselves to our fate.

<p/>Today was fair, and we went to Hyde Park, close by, for we are more
aristocratic than we look. The Duke of Devonshire lives near. I often
see his (<font color='blue'><b>Hyde</b></font>) footmen lounging at the back gate, and the Duke of Wellington's
house is not far off. Such sights as I saw, my dear! It was as good
as Punch, for there were fat dowagers rolling about in their red and
yellow coaches, with gorgeous Jeameses in silk stockings and velvet
coats, up behind, and powdered coachmen in front. Smart maids, with
the rosiest children I ever saw, handsome girls, looking half asleep,
dandies in queer English hats and lavender kids lounging about, and
tall soldiers, in short red jackets and muffin caps stuck on one side,
looking so funny I longed to sketch them.

<p/>Rotten Row means ``Route de Roi', or the king's way, but now it's more
like a riding school than anything else. The horses are splendid, and
the men, especially the grooms, ride well, but the women are stiff, and
bounce, which isn't according to our rules. I longed to show them a
tearing American gallop, for they trotted solemnly up and down, in
their scant habits and high hats, looking like the women in a toy
Noah's Ark.. Everyone rides--old men, stout ladies, little
children--and the young folks do a deal of flirting here, I saw a pair
exchange rose buds, for it's the thing to wear one in the button-hole,
and I thought it rather a nice little idea.

<p/>In the P.M. to Westminster Abbey, but don't expect me to describe it,
that's impossible, so I'll only say it was sublime! This evening we are
going to see Fechter, which will be an appropriate end to the happiest
day of my life.

<p/>It's very late, but I can't let my letter go in the morning without
telling you what happened last evening. Who do you think came in, as
we were at tea? Laurie's English friends, Fred and Frank Vaughn! I
was so surprised, for I shouldn't have known them but for the cards.
Both are tall fellows with whiskers, Fred handsome in the English
style, and Frank much better, for he (<font color='blue'><b>Frank</b></font>) only limps slightly, and uses no
crutches. They had heard from Laurie where we were to be, and came to
ask us to their house, but Uncle won't go, so we shall return the call,
and see them as we can. They went to the theater with us, and we did
have such a good time, for Frank devoted himself to Flo, and Fred and I
talked over past, present, and future fun as if we had known each other
all our days. Tell Beth Frank asked for her (<font color='blue'><b>Beth</b></font>), and was sorry to hear of
her (<font color='blue'><b>Beth</b></font>) ill health. Fred laughed when I spoke of Jo, and sent his (<font color='blue'><b>Fred</b></font>)
`respectful compliments to the big hat'. Neither of them had forgotten
Camp Laurence, or the fun we had there. What ages ago it seems,
doesn't it?

<p/>Aunt is tapping on the wall for the third time, so I must stop. I
really feel like a dissipated London fine lady, writing here so late,
with my room full of pretty things, and my head a jumble of parks,
theaters, new gowns, and gallant creatures who say <div class="bookquote">``Ah!''  (<font color='red'><b>creatures</b></font>)</div>and twirl
their blond mustaches with the true English lordliness. I long to see
you all, and in spite of my nonsense am, as ever, your loving...

<p/>AMY


<p/>PARIS

<p/>Dear girls,

<p/>In my last I told you about our London visit, how kind the Vaughns
were, and what pleasant parties they made for us. I enjoyed the trips
to Hampton Court and the Kensington Museum more than anything else, for
at Hampton I saw Raphael's cartoons, and at the Museum, rooms full of
pictures by Turner, Lawrence, Reynolds, Hogarth, and the other great
creatures. The day in Richmond Park was charming, for we had a regular
English picnic, and I had more splendid oaks and groups of deer than I
could copy, also heard a nightingale, and saw larks go up. We `did'
London to our heart's content, thanks to Fred and Frank, and were sorry
to go away, for though English people are slow to take you in, when
they once make up their minds to do it they cannot be outdone in
hospitality, I think. The Vaughns hope to meet us in Rome next winter,
and I shall be dreadfully disappointed if they don't, for Grace and I
are great friends, and the boys very nice fellows, especially Fred.

<p/>Well, we were hardly settled here, when he (<font color='blue'><b>Fred</b></font>) turned up again, saying he (<font color='blue'><b>Fred</b></font>)
had come for a holiday, and was going to Switzerland. Aunt looked sober
at first, but he (<font color='blue'><b>Fred</b></font>) was so cool about it she (<font color='blue'><b>Aunt</b></font>) couldn't say a word. And now
we get on nicely, and are very glad he (<font color='blue'><b>Fred</b></font>) came, for he (<font color='blue'><b>Fred</b></font>) speaks French like
a native, and I don't know what we should do without him (<font color='blue'><b>Fred</b></font>). Uncle
doesn't know ten words, and insists on talking English very loud, as if
it would make people understand him (<font color='blue'><b>Uncle</b></font>). Aunt's pronunciation is
old-fashioned, and Flo and I, though we flattered ourselves that we
knew a good deal, find we don't, and are very grateful to have Fred do
the '_parley vooing_', as Uncle calls it.

<p/>Such delightful times as we are having! Sight-seeing from morning till
night, stopping for nice lunches in the gay _cafes_, and meeting with
all sorts of droll adventures. Rainy days I spend in the Louvre,
revelling in pictures. Jo would turn up her (<font color='blue'><b>Jo</b></font>) naughty nose at some of
the finest, because she (<font color='blue'><b>Jo</b></font>) has no soul for art, but I have, and I'm
cultivating eye and taste as fast as I can. She (<font color='blue'><b>Jo</b></font>) would like the relics
of great people better, for I've seen her (<font color='blue'><b>Jo</b></font>) Napoleon's cocked hat and
gray coat, his (<font color='blue'><b>Napoleon</b></font>) baby's cradle and his (<font color='blue'><b>Napoleon</b></font>) old toothbrush, also Marie
Antoinette's little shoe, the ring of Saint Denis, Charlemagne's sword,
and many other interesting things. I'll talk for hours about them when
I come, but haven't time to write.

<p/>The Palais Royale is a heavenly place, so full of _bijouterie_ and
lovely things that I'm nearly distracted because I can't buy them.
Fred wanted to get me some, but of course I didn't allow it. Then the
Bois and Champs Elysees are _tres magnifique_. I've seen the imperial
family several times, the emperor an ugly, hard-looking man, the
empress pale and pretty, but dressed in bad taste, I thought--purple
dress, green hat, and yellow gloves. Little Nap is a handsome boy, who
sits chatting to his (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>) tutor, and kisses his (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>) hand to the people as he (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>)
passes in his (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>) four-horse barouche, with postilions in red satin jackets
and a mounted guard before and behind.

<p/>We often walk in the Tuileries Gardens, for they are lovely, though the
antique Luxembourg Gardens suit me better. Pere la Chaise is very
curious, for many of the tombs are like small rooms, and looking in,
one sees a table, with images or pictures of the dead, and chairs for
the mourners to sit in when they come to lament. That is so Frenchy.

<p/>Our rooms are on the Rue de Rivoli, and sitting on the balcony, we look
up and down the long, brilliant street. It is so pleasant that we
spend our evenings talking there when too tired with our day's work to
go out. Fred is very entertaining, and is altogether the most
agreeable young man I ever knew--except Laurie, whose manners are more
charming. I wish Fred was dark, for I don't fancy light men, however,
the Vaughns are very rich and come of an excellent family, so I won't
find fault with their yellow hair, as my own is yellower.

<p/>Next week we are off to Germany and Switzerland, and as we shall travel
fast, I shall only be able to give you hasty letters. I keep my diary,
and try to `remember correctly and describe clearly all that I see and
admire', as Father advised. It is good practice for me, and with my
sketchbook will give you a better idea of my tour than these scribbles.

<p/>Adieu, I embrace you tenderly. _<div class="bookquote">``Votre Amie.'' (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div>_


<p/>HEIDELBERG

<p/>My dear Mamma,

<p/>Having a quiet hour before we leave for Berne, I'll try to tell you
what has happened, for some of it is very important, as you will see.

<p/>The sail up the Rhine was perfect, and I just sat and enjoyed it with
all my might. Get Father's old guidebooks and read about it. I
haven't words beautiful enough to describe it. At Coblentz we had a
lovely time, for some students from Bonn, with whom Fred got acquainted
on the boat, gave us a serenade. It was a moonlight night, and about
one o'clock Flo and I were waked by the most delicious music under our
windows. We flew up, and hid behind the curtains, but sly peeps showed
us Fred and the students singing away down below. It was the most
romantic thing I ever saw--the river, the bridge of boats, the great
fortress opposite, moonlight everywhere, and music fit to melt a heart
of stone.

<p/>When they were done we threw down some flowers, and saw them scramble
for them, kiss their hands to the invisible ladies, and go laughing
away, to smoke and drink beer, I suppose. Next morning Fred showed me
one of the crumpled flowers in his (<font color='blue'><b>Fred</b></font>) vest pocket, and looked very
sentimental. I laughed at him (<font color='blue'><b>Fred</b></font>), and said I didn't throw it, but Flo,
which seemed to disgust him (<font color='blue'><b>Fred</b></font>), for he (<font color='blue'><b>Fred</b></font>) tossed it out of the window, and
turned sensible again. I'm afraid I'm going to have trouble with that
boy, it begins to look like it.

<p/>The baths at Nassau were very gay, so was Baden-Baden, where Fred lost
some money, and I scolded him (<font color='blue'><b>Fred</b></font>). He (<font color='blue'><b>Fred</b></font>) needs someone to look after him (<font color='blue'><b>Fred</b></font>) when
Frank is not with him (<font color='blue'><b>Frank</b></font>). Kate said once she (<font color='blue'><b>Kate</b></font>) hoped he (<font color='blue'><b>Frank</b></font>)'d marry soon, and I
quite agree with her (<font color='blue'><b>Kate</b></font>) that it would be well for him (<font color='blue'><b>Frank</b></font>). Frankfurt was
delightful. I saw Goethe's house, Schiller's statue, and Dannecker's
famous <div class="bookquote">``Ariadne.''  (<font color='red'><b>Schiller</b></font>)</div>It was very lovely, but I should have enjoyed it
more if I had known the story better. I didn't like to ask, as
everyone knew it or pretended they did. I wish Jo would tell me all
about it. I ought to have read more, for I find I don't know anything,
and it mortifies me.

<p/>Now comes the serious part, for it happened here, and Fred has just
gone. He (<font color='blue'><b>Fred</b></font>) has been so kind and jolly that we all got quite fond of him (<font color='blue'><b>Fred</b></font>).
I never thought of anything but a traveling friendship till the
serenade night. Since then I've begun to feel that the moonlight
walks, balcony talks, and daily adventures were something more to him (<font color='blue'><b>Fred</b></font>)
than fun. I haven't flirted, Mother, truly, but remembered what you
said to me, and have done my very best. I can't help it if people like
me. I don't try to make them, and it worries me if I don't care for
them, though Jo says I haven't got any heart. Now I know Mother will
shake her (<font color='blue'><b>Mother</b></font>) head, and the girls say, <div class="bookquote">``Oh, the mercenary little wretch!'' (<font color='red'><b>the girls</b></font>)</div>,
but I've made up my mind, and if Fred asks me, I shall accept him (<font color='blue'><b>Fred</b></font>),
though I'm not madly in love. I like him (<font color='blue'><b>Fred</b></font>), and we get on comfortably
together. He (<font color='blue'><b>Fred</b></font>) is handsome, young, clever enough, and very rich--ever so
much richer than the Laurences. I don't think his (<font color='blue'><b>Fred</b></font>) family would object,
and I should be very happy, for they are all kind, well-bred, generous
people, and they like me. Fred, as the eldest twin, will have the
estate, I suppose, and such a splendid one it is! A city house in a
fashionable street, not so showy as our big houses, but twice as
comfortable and full of solid luxury, such as English people believe
in. I like it, for it's genuine. I've seen the plate, the family
jewels, the old servants, and pictures of the country place, with its
park, great house, lovely grounds, and fine horses. Oh, it would be
all I should ask! And I'd rather have it than any title such as girls
snap up so readily, and find nothing behind. I may be mercenary, but I
hate poverty, and don't mean to bear it a minute longer than I can
help. One of us _must_ marry well. Meg didn't, Jo won't, Beth can't
yet, so I shall, and make everything okay all round. I wouldn't marry
a man I hated or despised. You may be sure of that, and though Fred is
not my model hero, he (<font color='blue'><b>Fred</b></font>) does very well, and in time I should get fond
enough of him (<font color='blue'><b>Fred</b></font>) if he (<font color='blue'><b>Fred</b></font>) was very fond of me, and let me do just as I liked.
So I've been turning the matter over in my mind the last week, for it
was impossible to help seeing that Fred liked me. He (<font color='blue'><b>Fred</b></font>) said nothing, but
little things showed it. He (<font color='blue'><b>Fred</b></font>) never goes with Flo, always gets on my
side of the carriage, table, or promenade, looks sentimental when we
are alone, and frowns at anyone else who ventures to speak to me.
Yesterday at dinner, when an Austrian officer stared at us and then
said something to his (<font color='blue'><b>officer</b></font>) friend, a rakish-looking baron, about '_ein
wonderschones Blondchen'_, Fred looked as fierce as a lion, and cut his (<font color='blue'><b>Fred</b></font>)
meat so savagely it nearly flew off his (<font color='blue'><b>Fred</b></font>) plate. He (<font color='blue'><b>Fred</b></font>) isn't one of the
cool, stiff Englishmen, but is rather peppery, for he (<font color='blue'><b>Fred</b></font>) has Scotch blood
in him (<font color='blue'><b>Fred</b></font>), as one might guess from his (<font color='blue'><b>Fred</b></font>) bonnie blue eyes.

<p/>Well, last evening we went up to the castle about sunset, at least all
of us but Fred, who was to meet us there after going to the Post
Restante for letters. We had a charming time poking about the ruins,
the vaults where the monster tun is, and the beautiful gardens made by
the elector long ago for his (<font color='blue'><b>elector</b></font>) English wife. I liked the great terrace
best, for the view was divine, so while the rest went to see the rooms
inside, I sat there trying to sketch the gray stone lion's head on the
wall, with scarlet woodbine sprays hanging round it. I felt as if I'd
got into a romance, sitting there, watching the Neckar rolling through
the valley, listening to the music of the Austrian band below, and
waiting for my lover, like a real storybook girl. I had a feeling that
something was going to happen and I was ready for it. I didn't feel
blushy or quakey, but quite cool and only a little excited.

<p/>By-and-by I heard Fred's voice, and then he (<font color='blue'><b>Fred</b></font>) came hurrying through the
great arch to find me. He (<font color='blue'><b>Fred</b></font>) looked so troubled that I forgot all about
myself, and asked what the matter was. He (<font color='blue'><b>Fred</b></font>) said he (<font color='blue'><b>Fred</b></font>)'d just got a letter
begging him (<font color='blue'><b>Fred</b></font>) to come home, for Frank was very ill. So he (<font color='blue'><b>Frank</b></font>) was going at
once on the night train and only had time to say good-by. I was very
sorry for him (<font color='blue'><b>Frank</b></font>), and disappointed for myself, but only for a minute
because he (<font color='blue'><b>Frank</b></font>) said, as he (<font color='blue'><b>Frank</b></font>) shook hands, and said it in a way that I could
not mistake, <div class="bookquote">``I shall soon come back, you won't forget me, Amy?''

 (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div><p/>I didn't promise, but I looked at him (<font color='blue'><b>Frank</b></font>), and he (<font color='blue'><b>Frank</b></font>) seemed satisfied, and
there was no time for anything but messages and good-byes, for he (<font color='blue'><b>Frank</b></font>) was
off in an hour, and we all miss him (<font color='blue'><b>Frank</b></font>) very much. I know he (<font color='blue'><b>Frank</b></font>) wanted to
speak, but I think, from something he (<font color='blue'><b>Frank</b></font>) once hinted, that he (<font color='blue'><b>Frank</b></font>) had promised
his (<font color='blue'><b>Frank</b></font>) father not to do anything of the sort yet a while, for he (<font color='blue'><b>Frank</b></font>) is a rash
boy, and the old gentleman dreads a foreign daughter-in-law. We shall
soon meet in Rome, and then, if I don't change my mind, I'll say <div class="bookquote">``Yes,
thank you,''  (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div>when he (<font color='blue'><b>Frank</b></font>) says <div class="bookquote">``Will you, please?''

 (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div><p/>Of course this is all _very private_, but I wished you to know what was
going on. Don't be anxious about me, remember I am your `prudent Amy',
and be sure I will do nothing rashly. Send me as much advice as you
like. I'll use it if I can. I wish I could see you for a good talk,
Marmee. Love and trust me.

<p/>Ever your AMY



<p/>CHAPTER THIRTY-TWO

<p/>TENDER TROUBLES

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Jo, I'm anxious about Beth.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Why, Mother, she (<font color='blue'><b>Mother</b></font>) has seemed unusually well since the babies came.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``It's not her (<font color='blue'><b>Mother</b></font>) health that troubles me now, it's her (<font color='blue'><b>Mother</b></font>) spirits. I'm sure
there is something on her (<font color='blue'><b>Mother</b></font>) mind, and I want you to discover what it is.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``What makes you think so, Mother?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``She (<font color='blue'><b>Mother</b></font>) sits alone a good deal, and doesn't talk to her (<font color='blue'><b>Mother</b></font>) father as much as
she (<font color='blue'><b>Mother</b></font>) used. I found her (<font color='blue'><b>Mother</b></font>) crying over the babies the other day. When she (<font color='blue'><b>Mother</b></font>)
sings, the songs are always sad ones, and now and then I see a look in
her (<font color='blue'><b>Mother</b></font>) face that I don't understand. This isn't like Beth, and it worries
me.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Have you asked her (<font color='blue'><b>Beth</b></font>) about it?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I have tried once or twice, but she (<font color='blue'><b>Beth</b></font>) either evaded my questions or
looked so distressed that I stopped. I never force my children's
confidence, and I seldom have to wait for long.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Jo/Miss Jo/JO</b></font>)</div><p/>Mrs. March glanced at Jo as she (<font color='blue'><b>Jo</b></font>) spoke, but the face opposite seemed
quite unconscious of any secret disquietude but Beth's, and after
sewing thoughtfully for a minute, Jo said, <div class="bookquote">``I think she (<font color='blue'><b>Beth</b></font>) is growing up,
and so begins to dream dreams, and have hopes and fears and fidgets,
without knowing why or being able to explain them. Why, Mother, Beth's
eighteen, but we don't realize it, and treat her (<font color='blue'><b>Mother</b></font>) like a child,
forgetting she (<font color='blue'><b>Mother</b></font>)'s a woman.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Jo/Miss Jo/JO</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``So she (<font color='blue'><b>Mother</b></font>) is. Dear heart, how fast you do grow up,''  (<font color='red'><b>mother</b></font>)</div>returned her (<font color='blue'><b>Jo</b></font>) mother
with a sigh and a smile.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Can't be helped, Marmee, so you must resign yourself to all sorts of
worries, and let your birds hop out of the nest, one by one. I promise
never to hop very far, if that is any comfort to you.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``It's a great comfort, Jo. I always feel strong when you are at home,
now Meg is gone. Beth is too feeble and Amy too young to depend upon,
but when the tug comes, you are always ready.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Why, you know I don't mind hard jobs much, and there must always be
one scrub in a family. Amy is splendid in fine works and I'm not, but
I feel in my element when all the carpets are to be taken up, or half
the family fall sick at once. Amy is distinguishing herself abroad, but
if anything is amiss at home, I'm your man.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I leave Beth to your hands, then, for she (<font color='blue'><b>Beth</b></font>) will open her (<font color='blue'><b>Beth</b></font>) tender little
heart to her (<font color='blue'><b>Beth</b></font>) Jo sooner than to anyone else. Be very kind, and don't
let her (<font color='blue'><b>Beth</b></font>) think anyone watches or talks about her (<font color='blue'><b>Beth</b></font>). If she (<font color='blue'><b>Beth</b></font>) only would get
quite strong and cheerful again, I shouldn't have a wish in the world.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Happy woman! I've got heaps.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``My dear, what are they?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I'll settle Bethy's troubles, and then I'll tell you mine. They are
not very wearing, so they'll keep.''  (<font color='red'><b>Jo/Miss Jo/JO</b></font>)</div>and Jo stitched away, with a wise
nod which set her (<font color='blue'><b>Jo</b></font>) mother's heart at rest about her (<font color='blue'><b>Jo</b></font>) for the present at
least.

<p/>While apparently absorbed in her (<font color='blue'><b>Jo</b></font>) own affairs, Jo watched Beth, and
after many conflicting conjectures, finally settled upon one which
seemed to explain the change in her (<font color='blue'><b>Jo</b></font>). A slight incident gave Jo the
clue to the mystery, she (<font color='blue'><b>Jo</b></font>) thought, and lively fancy, loving heart did
the rest. She (<font color='blue'><b>Jo</b></font>) was affecting to write busily one Saturday afternoon,
when she (<font color='blue'><b>Jo</b></font>) and Beth were alone together. Yet as she (<font color='blue'><b>Beth</b></font>) scribbled, she (<font color='blue'><b>Beth</b></font>) kept
her (<font color='blue'><b>Beth</b></font>) eye on her (<font color='blue'><b>Beth</b></font>) sister, who seemed unusually quiet. Sitting at the
window, Beth's work often dropped into her (<font color='blue'><b>Beth</b></font>) lap, and she (<font color='blue'><b>Beth</b></font>) leaned her (<font color='blue'><b>Beth</b></font>) head
upon her (<font color='blue'><b>Beth</b></font>) hand, in a dejected attitude, while her (<font color='blue'><b>Beth</b></font>) eyes rested on the
dull, autumnal landscape. Suddenly some one passed below, whistling
like an operatic blackbird, and a voice called out, <div class="bookquote">``All serene! Coming
in tonight.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Beth</b></font>)</div><p/>Beth started, leaned forward, smiled and nodded, watched the passer-by
till his (<font color='blue'><b>Beth</b></font>) quick tramp died away, then said softly as if to herself, <div class="bookquote">``How
strong and well and happy that dear boy looks.''

 (<font color='red'><b>tramp</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Hum!''  (<font color='red'><b>Jo/Miss Jo/JO</b></font>)</div>said Jo, still intent upon her (<font color='blue'><b>Jo</b></font>) sister's face, for the bright
color faded as quickly as it came, the smile vanished, and presently a
tear lay shining on the window ledge. Beth whisked it off, and in her (<font color='blue'><b>Beth</b></font>)
half-averted face read a tender sorrow that made her (<font color='blue'><b>Beth</b></font>) own eyes fill.
Fearing to betray herself, she (<font color='blue'><b>Beth</b></font>) slipped away, murmuring something about
needing more paper.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Mercy on me, Beth loves Laurie!''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Beth</b></font>) said, sitting down in her (<font color='blue'><b>Beth</b></font>) own
room, pale with the shock of the discovery which she (<font color='blue'><b>Beth</b></font>) believed she (<font color='blue'><b>Beth</b></font>) had
just made. <div class="bookquote">``I never dreamed of such a thing. What will Mother say? I
wonder if her (<font color='blue'><b>Mother</b></font>)...''  (<font color='red'><b>Jo/Miss Jo/JO</b></font>)</div>there Jo stopped and turned scarlet with a sudden
thought. <div class="bookquote">``If he (<font color='blue'><b>Laurie</b></font>) shouldn't love back again, how dreadful it would be.
He (<font color='blue'><b>Laurie</b></font>) must. I'll make him (<font color='blue'><b>Laurie</b></font>)!''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>and she (<font color='blue'><b>Jo</b></font>) shook her (<font color='blue'><b>Jo</b></font>) head threateningly at the
picture of the mischievous-looking boy laughing at her (<font color='blue'><b>Jo</b></font>) from the wall.
<div class="bookquote">``Oh dear, we are growing up with a vengeance. Here's Meg married and a
mamma, Amy flourishing away at Paris, and Beth in love. I'm the only
one that has sense enough to keep out of mischief.''  (<font color='red'><b>Jo/Miss Jo/JO</b></font>)</div>Jo thought intently
for a minute with her (<font color='blue'><b>Jo</b></font>) eyes fixed on the picture, then she (<font color='blue'><b>Jo</b></font>) smoothed out
her (<font color='blue'><b>Jo</b></font>) wrinkled forehead and said, with a decided nod at the face
opposite, <div class="bookquote">``No thank you, sir, you're very charming, but you've no more
stability than a weathercock. So you needn't write touching notes and
smile in that insinuating way, for it won't do a bit of good, and I
won't have it.''

 (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div><p/>Then she (<font color='blue'><b>Jo</b></font>) sighed, and fell into a reverie from which she (<font color='blue'><b>Jo</b></font>) did not wake
till the early twilight sent her (<font color='blue'><b>Jo</b></font>) down to take new observations, which
only confirmed her (<font color='blue'><b>Jo</b></font>) suspicion. Though Laurie flirted with Amy and joked
with Jo, his (<font color='blue'><b>Laurie</b></font>) manner to Beth had always been peculiarly kind and gentle,
but so was everybody's. Therefore, no one thought of imagining that he (<font color='blue'><b>Laurie</b></font>)
cared more for her (<font color='blue'><b>Beth</b></font>) than for the others. Indeed, a general impression
had prevailed in the family of late that `our boy' was getting fonder
than ever of Jo, who, however, wouldn't hear a word upon the subject
and scolded violently if anyone dared to suggest it. If they had known
the various tender passages which had been nipped in the bud, they
would have had the immense satisfaction of saying, <div class="bookquote">``I told you so.''
 (<font color='red'><b>Jo/Miss Jo/JO</b></font>)</div>But Jo hated `philandering', and wouldn't allow it, always having a
joke or a smile ready at the least sign of impending danger.

<p/>When Laurie first went to college, he (<font color='blue'><b>Laurie</b></font>) fell in love about once a month,
but these small flames were as brief as ardent, did no damage, and much
amused Jo, who took great interest in the alternations of hope,
despair, and resignation, which were confided to her (<font color='blue'><b>Jo</b></font>) in their weekly
conferences. But there came a time when Laurie ceased to worship at
many shrines, hinted darkly at one all-absorbing passion, and indulged
occasionally in Byronic fits of gloom. Then he (<font color='blue'><b>Laurie</b></font>) avoided the tender
subject altogether, wrote philosophical notes to Jo, turned studious,
and gave out that he (<font color='blue'><b>Laurie</b></font>) was going to `dig', intending to graduate in a
blaze of glory. This suited the young lady better than twilight
confidences, tender pressures of the hand, and eloquent glances of the
eye, for with Jo, brain developed earlier than heart, and she (<font color='blue'><b>Jo</b></font>) preferred
imaginary heroes to real ones, because when tired of them, the former
could be shut up in the tin kitchen till called for, and the latter
were less manageable.

<p/>Things were in this state when the grand discovery was made, and Jo
watched Laurie that night as she (<font color='blue'><b>Jo</b></font>) had never done before. If she (<font color='blue'><b>Jo</b></font>) had not
got the new idea into her (<font color='blue'><b>Jo</b></font>) head, she (<font color='blue'><b>Jo</b></font>) would have seen nothing unusual in
the fact that Beth was very quiet, and Laurie very kind to her (<font color='blue'><b>Beth</b></font>). But
having given the rein to her (<font color='blue'><b>Beth</b></font>) lively fancy, it galloped away with her (<font color='blue'><b>Beth</b></font>) at
a great pace, and common sense, being rather weakened by a long course
of romance writing, did not come to the rescue. As usual Beth lay on
the sofa and Laurie sat in a low chair close by, amusing her (<font color='blue'><b>Beth</b></font>) with all
sorts of gossip, for she (<font color='blue'><b>Beth</b></font>) depended on her (<font color='blue'><b>Beth</b></font>) weekly `spin', and he (<font color='blue'><b>Laurie</b></font>) never
disappointed her (<font color='blue'><b>Beth</b></font>). But that evening Jo fancied that Beth's eyes rested
on the lively, dark face beside her (<font color='blue'><b>Jo</b></font>) with peculiar pleasure, and that
she (<font color='blue'><b>Jo</b></font>) listened with intense interest to an account of some exciting
cricket match, though the phrases, `caught off a tice', `stumped off
his (<font color='blue'><b>Laurie</b></font>) ground', and `the leg hit for three', were as intelligible to her (<font color='blue'><b>Jo</b></font>)
as Sanskrit. She (<font color='blue'><b>Jo</b></font>) also fancied, having set her (<font color='blue'><b>Jo</b></font>) heart upon seeing it,
that she (<font color='blue'><b>Jo</b></font>) saw a certain increase of gentleness in Laurie's manner, that
he (<font color='blue'><b>Laurie</b></font>) dropped his (<font color='blue'><b>Laurie</b></font>) voice now and then, laughed less than usual, was a
little absent-minded, and settled the afghan over Beth's feet with an
assiduity that was really almost tender.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Who knows? Stranger things have happened,''  (<font color='red'><b>Jo/Miss Jo/JO</b></font>)</div>thought Jo, as she (<font color='blue'><b>Jo</b></font>) fussed
about the room. <div class="bookquote">``She (<font color='blue'><b>Beth</b></font>) will make quite an angel of him (<font color='blue'><b>angel</b></font>), and he (<font color='blue'><b>angel</b></font>) will make
life delightfully easy and pleasant for the dear, if they only love
each other. I don't see how he (<font color='blue'><b>angel</b></font>) can help it, and I do believe he (<font color='blue'><b>angel</b></font>) would
if the rest of us were out of the way.''

 (<font color='red'><b>everyone</b></font>)</div><p/>As everyone was out of the way but herself, Jo began to feel that she (<font color='blue'><b>Jo</b></font>)
ought to dispose of herself with all speed. But where should she (<font color='blue'><b>Jo</b></font>) go?
And burning to lay herself upon the shrine of sisterly devotion, she (<font color='blue'><b>Jo</b></font>)
sat down to settle that point.

<p/>Now, the old sofa was a regular patriarch of a sofa--long, broad,
well-cushioned, and low, a trifle shabby, as well it might be, for the
girls had slept and sprawled on it as babies, fished over the back,
rode on the arms, and had menageries under it as children, and rested
tired heads, dreamed dreams, and listened to tender talk on it as young
women. They all loved it, for it was a family refuge, and one corner
had always been Jo's favorite lounging place. Among the many pillows
that adorned the venerable couch was one, hard, round, covered with
prickly horsehair, and furnished with a knobby button at each end.
This repulsive pillow was her (<font color='blue'><b>Jo</b></font>) especial property, being used as a weapon
of defense, a barricade, or a stern preventive of too much slumber.

<p/>Laurie knew this pillow well, and had cause to regard it with deep
aversion, having been unmercifully pummeled with it in former days when
romping was allowed, and now frequently debarred by it from the seat he (<font color='blue'><b>Laurie</b></font>)
most coveted next to Jo in the sofa corner. If `the sausage' as they
called it, stood on end, it was a sign that he (<font color='blue'><b>Laurie</b></font>) might approach and
repose, but if it lay flat across the sofa, woe to man, woman, or child
who dared disturb it! That evening Jo forgot to barricade her (<font color='blue'><b>Jo</b></font>) corner,
and had not been in her (<font color='blue'><b>Jo</b></font>) seat five minutes, before a massive form
appeared beside her (<font color='blue'><b>Jo</b></font>), and with both arms spread over the sofa back, both
long legs stretched out before him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>), Laurie exclaimed, with a sigh of
satisfaction...

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Now, this is filling at the price.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Laurie/Mr. Laurie/LAURIE</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``No slang,''  (<font color='red'><b>Jo/Miss Jo/JO</b></font>)</div>snapped Jo, slamming down the pillow. But it was too late,
there was no room for it, and coasting onto the floor, it disappeared
in a most mysterious manner.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Come, Jo, don't be thorny. After studying himself to a skeleton all
the week, a fellow deserves petting and ought to get it.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Beth will pet you. I'm busy.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``No, she (<font color='blue'><b>Beth</b></font>)'s not to be bothered with me, but you like that sort of thing,
unless you've suddenly lost your taste for it. Have you? Do you hate
your boy, and want to fire pillows at him (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>)?''

 (<font color='red'><b>Jo/Miss Jo/JO</b></font>)</div><p/>Anything more wheedlesome than that touching appeal was seldom heard,
but Jo quenched `her (<font color='blue'><b>Jo</b></font>) boy' by turning on him (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>) with a stern query, <div class="bookquote">``How
many bouquets have you sent Miss Randal this week?''

 (<font color='red'><b>him</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Not one, upon my word. She (<font color='blue'><b>Randal</b></font>)'s engaged. Now then.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I'm glad of it, that's one of your foolish extravagances, sending
flowers and things to girls for whom you don't care two pins,''
 (<font color='red'><b>Jo/Miss Jo/JO</b></font>)</div>continued Jo reprovingly.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Sensible girls for whom I do care whole papers of pins won't let me
send them `flowers and things', so what can I do? My feelings need a
`vent'.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Mother doesn't approve of flirting even in fun, and you do flirt
desperately, Teddy.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/>``I'd give anything if I could answer, <div class="bookquote">``So do you'. As I can't, I'll
merely say that I don't see any harm in that pleasant little game, if
all parties understand that it's only play.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Well, it does look pleasant, but I can't learn how it's done. I've
tried, because one feels awkward in company not to do as everybody else
is doing, but I don't seem to get on'' (<font color='red'><b>Jo/Miss Jo/JO</b></font>)</div>, said Jo, forgetting to play
mentor.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Take lessons of Amy, she (<font color='blue'><b>Amy</b></font>) has a regular talent for it.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Yes, she (<font color='blue'><b>Amy</b></font>) does it very prettily, and never seems to go too far. I
suppose it's natural to some people to please without trying, and
others to always say and do the wrong thing in the wrong place.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I'm glad you can't flirt. It's really refreshing to see a sensible,
straightforward girl, who can be jolly and kind without making a fool
of herself. Between ourselves, Jo, some of the girls I know really do
go on at such a rate I'm ashamed of them. They don't mean any harm, I'm
sure, but if they knew how we fellows talked about them afterward,
they'd mend their ways, I fancy.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``They do the same, and as their tongues are the sharpest, you fellows
get the worst of it, for you are as silly as they, every bit. If you
behaved properly, they would, but knowing you like their nonsense, they
keep it up, and then you blame them.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Much you know about it, ma'am,''  (<font color='red'><b>Laurie/Mr. Laurie/LAURIE</b></font>)</div>said Laurie in a superior tone. ``We
don't like romps and flirts, though we may act as if we did sometimes.
The pretty, modest girls are never talked about, except respectfully,
among gentleman. Bless your innocent soul! If you could be in my place
for a month you'd see things that would astonish you a trifle. Upon my
word, when I see one of those harum-scarum girls, I always want to say
with our friend Cock Robin...

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Out upon you, fie upon you,
Bold-faced jig!''

 (<font color='red'><b>Laurie/Mr. Laurie/LAURIE</b></font>)</div><p/>It was impossible to help laughing at the funny conflict between
Laurie's chivalrous reluctance to speak ill of womankind, and his (<font color='blue'><b>Laurie</b></font>) very
natural dislike of the unfeminine folly of which fashionable society
showed him (<font color='blue'><b>Laurie</b></font>) many samples. Jo knew that `young Laurence' was regarded as
a most eligible parti by worldly mamas, was much smiled upon by their
daughters, and flattered enough by ladies of all ages to make a coxcomb
of him (<font color='blue'><b>Laurence</b></font>), so she (<font color='blue'><b>Jo</b></font>) watched him (<font color='blue'><b>Laurence</b></font>) rather jealously, fearing he (<font color='blue'><b>Laurence</b></font>) would be
spoiled, and rejoiced more than she (<font color='blue'><b>Jo</b></font>) confessed to find that he (<font color='blue'><b>Laurence</b></font>) still
believed in modest girls. Returning suddenly to her (<font color='blue'><b>Jo</b></font>) admonitory tone,
she (<font color='blue'><b>Jo</b></font>) said, dropping her (<font color='blue'><b>Jo</b></font>) voice, <div class="bookquote">``If you must have a `vent', Teddy, go and
devote yourself to one of the `pretty, modest girls' whom you do
respect, and not waste your time with the silly ones.''

 (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``You really advise it?''  (<font color='red'><b>Laurie/Mr. Laurie/LAURIE</b></font>)</div>and Laurie looked at her (<font color='blue'><b>Jo</b></font>) with an odd mixture of
anxiety and merriment in his (<font color='blue'><b>Laurie</b></font>) face.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Yes, I do, but you'd better wait till you are through college, on the
whole, and be fitting yourself for the place meantime. You're not half
good enough for--well, whoever the modest girl may be.''  (<font color='red'><b>Jo/Miss Jo/JO</b></font>)</div>and Jo looked a
little queer likewise, for a name had almost escaped her (<font color='blue'><b>Jo</b></font>).

<p/><div class="bookquote">``That I'm not!''  (<font color='red'><b>Laurie/Mr. Laurie/LAURIE</b></font>)</div>acquiesced Laurie, with an expression of humility quite
new to him (<font color='blue'><b>Laurie</b></font>), as he (<font color='blue'><b>Laurie</b></font>) dropped his (<font color='blue'><b>Laurie</b></font>) eyes and absently wound Jo's apron tassel
round his (<font color='blue'><b>Laurie</b></font>) finger.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Mercy on us, this will never do,''  (<font color='red'><b>Jo/Miss Jo/JO</b></font>)</div>thought Jo, adding aloud, <div class="bookquote">``Go and
sing to me. I'm dying for some music, and always like yours.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Jo/Miss Jo/JO</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I'd rather stay here, thank you.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Well, you can't, there isn't room. Go and make yourself useful, since
you are too big to be ornamental. I thought you hated to be tied to a
woman's apron string?''  (<font color='red'><b>Jo/Miss Jo/JO</b></font>)</div>retorted Jo, quoting certain rebellious words of
his (<font color='blue'><b>Laurie</b></font>) own.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Ah, that depends on who wears the apron!''  (<font color='red'><b>Laurie/Mr. Laurie/LAURIE</b></font>)</div>and Laurie gave an audacious
tweak at the tassel.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Are you going?''  (<font color='red'><b>Jo/Miss Jo/JO</b></font>)</div>demanded Jo, diving for the pillow.

<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Laurie</b></font>) fled at once, and the minute it was well, <div class="bookquote">``Up with the bonnets of
bonnie Dundee,''  (<font color='red'><b>He</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Jo</b></font>) slipped away to return no more till the young
gentleman departed in high dudgeon.

<p/>Jo lay long awake that night, and was just dropping off when the sound
of a stifled sob made her (<font color='blue'><b>Jo</b></font>) fly to Beth's bedside, with the anxious
inquiry, <div class="bookquote">``What is it, dear?''

 (<font color='red'><b>Beth</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I thought you were asleep,''  (<font color='red'><b>Beth</b></font>)</div>sobbed Beth.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Is it the old pain, my precious?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``No, it's a new one, but I can bear it,''  (<font color='red'><b>Beth</b></font>)</div>and Beth tried to check her (<font color='blue'><b>Beth</b></font>)
tears.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Tell me all about it, and let me cure it as I often did the other.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``You can't, there is no cure.''  (<font color='red'><b>Beth</b></font>)</div>There Beth's voice gave way, and
clinging to her (<font color='blue'><b>Beth</b></font>) sister, she (<font color='blue'><b>Beth</b></font>) cried so despairingly that Jo was
frightened.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Where is it? Shall I call Mother?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``No, no, don't call her (<font color='blue'><b>Mother</b></font>), don't tell her (<font color='blue'><b>Mother</b></font>). I shall be better soon. Lie
down here and `poor' my head. I'll be quiet and go to sleep, indeed I
will.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Jo/Miss Jo/JO</b></font>)</div><p/>Jo obeyed, but as her (<font color='blue'><b>Jo</b></font>) hand went softly to and fro across Beth's hot
forehead and wet eyelids, her (<font color='blue'><b>Beth</b></font>) heart was very full and she (<font color='blue'><b>Beth</b></font>) longed to
speak. But young as she (<font color='blue'><b>Beth</b></font>) was, Jo had learned that hearts, like flowers,
cannot be rudely handled, but must open naturally, so though she (<font color='blue'><b>Jo</b></font>)
believed she (<font color='blue'><b>Jo</b></font>) knew the cause of Beth's new pain, she (<font color='blue'><b>Beth</b></font>) only said, in her (<font color='blue'><b>Beth</b></font>)
tenderest tone, <div class="bookquote">``Does anything trouble you, deary?''

 (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Yes, Jo,''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>after a long pause.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Wouldn't it comfort you to tell me what it is?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Not now, not yet.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Then I won't ask, but remember, Bethy, that Mother and Jo are always
glad to hear and help you, if they can.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I know it. I'll tell you by-and-by.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Is the pain better now?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Oh, yes, much better, you are so comfortable, Jo.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Go to sleep, dear. I'll stay with you.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Beth</b></font>)</div><p/>So cheek to cheek they fell asleep, and on the morrow Beth seemed quite
herself again, for at eighteen neither heads nor hearts ache long, and
a loving word can medicine most ills.

<p/>But Jo had made up her (<font color='blue'><b>Jo</b></font>) mind, and after pondering over a project for
some days, she (<font color='blue'><b>Jo</b></font>) confided it to her (<font color='blue'><b>Jo</b></font>) mother.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``You asked me the other day what my wishes were. I'll tell you one of
them, Marmee,''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Jo</b></font>) began, as they sat along together. <div class="bookquote">``I want to go
away somewhere this winter for a change.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Why, Jo?''  (<font color='red'><b>mother</b></font>)</div>and her (<font color='blue'><b>Jo</b></font>) mother looked up quickly, as if the words suggested
a double meaning.

<p/>With her (<font color='blue'><b>Jo</b></font>) eyes on her (<font color='blue'><b>Jo</b></font>) work Jo answered soberly, <div class="bookquote">``I want something new.
I feel restless and anxious to be seeing, doing, and learning more than
I am. I brood too much over my own small affairs, and need stirring
up, so as I can be spared this winter, I'd like to hop a little way and
try my wings.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Jo/Miss Jo/JO</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Where will you hop?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``To New York. I had a bright idea yesterday, and this is it. You know
Mrs. Kirke wrote to you for some respectable young person to teach her (<font color='blue'><b>Kirke</b></font>)
children and sew. It's rather hard to find just the thing, but I think
I should suit if I tried.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``My dear, go out to service in that great boarding house!''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>and Mrs.
March looked surprised, but not displeased.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``It's not exactly going out to service, for Mrs. Kirke is your
friend--the kindest soul that ever lived--and would make things
pleasant for me, I know. Her (<font color='blue'><b>Kirke</b></font>) family is separate from the rest, and no
one knows me there. Don't care if they do. It's honest work, and I'm
not ashamed of it.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Nor I. But your writing?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``All the better for the change. I shall see and hear new things, get
new ideas, and even if I haven't much time there, I shall bring home
quantities of material for my rubbish.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I have no doubt of it, but are these your only reasons for this sudden
fancy?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``No, Mother.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``May I know the others?''

 (<font color='red'><b>Jo/Miss Jo/JO</b></font>)</div><p/>Jo looked up and Jo looked down, then said slowly, with sudden color in
her (<font color='blue'><b>Jo</b></font>) cheeks. <div class="bookquote">``It may be vain and wrong to say it, but--I'm
afraid--Laurie is getting too fond of me.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Then you don't care for him (<font color='blue'><b>Laurie</b></font>) in the way it is evident he (<font color='blue'><b>Laurie</b></font>) begins to care
for you?''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>and Mrs. March looked anxious as she (<font color='blue'><b>Jo</b></font>) put the question.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Mercy, no! I love the dear boy, as I always have, and am immensely
proud of him (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>), but as for anything more, it's out of the question.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I'm glad of that, Jo.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Why, please?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Because, dear, I don't think you suited to one another. As friends
you are very happy, and your frequent quarrels soon blow over, but I
fear you would both rebel if you were mated for life. You are too much
alike and too fond of freedom, not to mention hot tempers and strong
wills, to get on happily together, in a relation which needs infinite
patience and forbearance, as well as love.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``That's just the feeling I had, though I couldn't express it. I'm glad
you think he (<font color='blue'><b>you</b></font>) is only beginning to care for me. It would trouble me
sadly to make him (<font color='blue'><b>you</b></font>) unhappy, for I couldn't fall in love with the dear
old fellow merely out of gratitude, could I?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``You are sure of his (<font color='blue'><b>fellow</b></font>) feeling for you?''

 (<font color='red'><b>Jo/Miss Jo/JO</b></font>)</div><p/>The color deepened in Jo's cheeks as she (<font color='blue'><b>Jo</b></font>) answered, with the look of
mingled pleasure, pride, and pain which young girls wear when speaking
of first lovers, <div class="bookquote">``I'm afraid it is so, Mother. He (<font color='blue'><b>fellow</b></font>) hasn't said
anything, but he (<font color='blue'><b>fellow</b></font>) looks a great deal. I think I had better go away
before it comes to anything.''

 (<font color='red'><b>lovers</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I agree with you, and if it can be managed you shall go.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Jo/Miss Jo/JO</b></font>)</div><p/>Jo looked relieved, and after a pause, said, smiling, <div class="bookquote">``How Mrs. Moffat
would wonder at your want of management, if she (<font color='blue'><b>Moffat</b></font>) knew, and how she (<font color='blue'><b>Moffat</b></font>) will
rejoice that Annie may still hope.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Jo/Miss Jo/JO</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Ah, Jo, mothers may differ in their management, but the hope is the
same in all--the desire to see their children happy. Meg is so, and I
am content with her (<font color='blue'><b>Meg</b></font>) success. You I leave to enjoy your liberty till
you tire of it, for only then will you find that there is something
sweeter. Amy is my chief care now, but her (<font color='blue'><b>Amy</b></font>) good sense will help her (<font color='blue'><b>Amy</b></font>).
For Beth, I indulge no hopes except that she (<font color='blue'><b>Beth</b></font>) may be well. By the way,
she (<font color='blue'><b>Beth</b></font>) seems brighter this last day or two. Have you spoken to her (<font color='blue'><b>Beth</b></font>)?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Yes, she (<font color='blue'><b>Beth</b></font>) owned she (<font color='blue'><b>Beth</b></font>) had a trouble, and promised to tell me by-and-by.
I said no more, for I think I know it,''  (<font color='red'><b>Jo/Miss Jo/JO</b></font>)</div>and Jo told her (<font color='blue'><b>Jo</b></font>) little story.

<p/>Mrs. March shook her (<font color='blue'><b>Jo</b></font>) head, and did not take so romantic a view of the
case, but looked grave, and repeated her (<font color='blue'><b>Jo</b></font>) opinion that for Laurie's sake
Jo should go away for a time.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Let us say nothing about it to him (<font color='blue'><b>I</b></font>) till the plan is settled, then I'll
run away before he (<font color='blue'><b>I</b></font>) can collect his (<font color='blue'><b>I</b></font>) wits and be tragic. Beth must think
I'm going to please myself, as I am, for I can't talk about Laurie to
her (<font color='blue'><b>Beth</b></font>). But she (<font color='blue'><b>Beth</b></font>) can pet and comfort him (<font color='blue'><b>Laurie</b></font>) after I'm gone, and so cure him (<font color='blue'><b>Laurie</b></font>)
of this romantic notion. He (<font color='blue'><b>Laurie</b></font>)'s been through so many little trials of
the sort, he (<font color='blue'><b>Laurie</b></font>)'s used to it, and will soon get over his (<font color='blue'><b>Laurie</b></font>) lovelornity.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Jo/Miss Jo/JO</b></font>)</div><p/>Jo spoke hopefully, but could not rid herself of the foreboding fear
that this `little trial' would be harder than the others, and that
Laurie would not get over his (<font color='blue'><b>Laurie</b></font>) `lovelornity' as easily as heretofore.

<p/>The plan was talked over in a family council and agreed upon, for Mrs.
Kirke gladly accepted Jo, and promised to make a pleasant home for her (<font color='blue'><b>Jo</b></font>).
The teaching would render her (<font color='blue'><b>Jo</b></font>) independent, and such leisure as she (<font color='blue'><b>Jo</b></font>) got
might be made profitable by writing, while the new scenes and society
would be both useful and agreeable. Jo liked the prospect and was
eager to be gone, for the home nest was growing too narrow for her (<font color='blue'><b>Jo</b></font>)
restless nature and adventurous spirit. When all was settled, with
fear and trembling she (<font color='blue'><b>Jo</b></font>) told Laurie, but to her (<font color='blue'><b>Jo</b></font>) surprise he (<font color='blue'><b>Laurie</b></font>) took it very
quietly. He (<font color='blue'><b>Laurie</b></font>) had been graver than usual of late, but very pleasant, and
when jokingly accused of turning over a new leaf, he (<font color='blue'><b>Laurie</b></font>) answered soberly,
<div class="bookquote">``So I am, and I mean this one shall stay turned.''

 (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div><p/>Jo was very much relieved that one of his (<font color='blue'><b>Laurie</b></font>) virtuous fits should come on
just then, and made her (<font color='blue'><b>Jo</b></font>) preparations with a lightened heart, for Beth
seemed more cheerful, and hoped she (<font color='blue'><b>Beth</b></font>) was doing the best for all.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``One thing I leave in your especial care,''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Beth</b></font>) said, the night before
she (<font color='blue'><b>Beth</b></font>) left.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``You mean your papers?''  (<font color='red'><b>Beth</b></font>)</div>asked Beth.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``No, my boy. Be very good to him (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>), won't you?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Of course I will, but I can't fill your place, and he (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>)'ll miss you
sadly.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``It won't hurt him (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>), so remember, I leave him (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>) in your charge, to plague,
pet, and keep in order.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I'll do my best, for your sake,''  (<font color='red'><b>Beth</b></font>)</div>promised Beth, wondering why Jo
looked at her (<font color='blue'><b>Jo</b></font>) so queerly.

<p/>When Laurie said good-by, he (<font color='blue'><b>Laurie</b></font>) whispered significantly, <div class="bookquote">``It won't do a
bit of good, Jo. My eye is on you, so mind what you do, or I'll come
and bring you home.''



 (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div><p/>CHAPTER THIRTY-THREE

<p/>JO``S JOURNAL

<p/>New York, November

<p/>Dear Marmee and Beth,

<p/>I'm going to write you a regular volume, for I've got heaps to tell,
though I'm not a fine young lady traveling on the continent. When I
lost sight of Father's dear old face, I felt a trifle blue, and might
have shed a briny drop or two, if an Irish lady with four small
children, all crying more or less, hadn't diverted my mind, for I
amused myself by dropping gingerbread nuts over the seat every time
they opened their mouths to roar.

<p/>Soon the sun came out, and taking it as a good omen, I cleared up
likewise and enjoyed my journey with all my heart.

<p/>Mrs. Kirke welcomed me so kindly I felt at home at once, even in that
big house full of strangers. She (<font color='blue'><b>Kirke</b></font>) gave me a funny little sky
parlor--all she (<font color='blue'><b>Kirke</b></font>) had, but there is a stove in it, and a nice table in a
sunny window, so I can sit here and write whenever I like. A fine view
and a church tower opposite atone for the many stairs, and I took a
fancy to my den on the spot. The nursery, where I am to teach and sew,
is a pleasant room next Mrs. Kirke's private parlor, and the two little
girls are pretty children, rather spoiled, I fancy, but they took to me
after telling them The Seven Bad Pigs, and I've no doubt I shall make a
model governess.

<p/>I am to have my meals with the children, if I prefer it to the great
table, and for the present I do, for I am bashful, though no one will
believe it.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Now, my dear, make yourself at home,''  (<font color='red'><b>Mrs. K.</b></font>)</div>said Mrs. K. in her (<font color='blue'><b>K.</b></font>) motherly
way, <div class="bookquote">``I'm on the drive from morning to night, as you may suppose with
such a family, but a great anxiety will be off my mind if I know the
children are safe with you. My rooms are always open to you, and your
own shall be as comfortable as I can make it. There are some pleasant
people in the house if you feel sociable, and your evenings are always
free. Come to me if anything goes wrong, and be as happy as you can.
There's the tea bell, I must run and change my cap.''  (<font color='red'><b>Mrs. K.</b></font>)</div>And off she (<font color='blue'><b>K.</b></font>)
bustled, leaving me to settle myself in my new nest.

<p/>As I went downstairs soon after, I saw something I liked. The flights
are very long in this tall house, and as I stood waiting at the head of
the third one for a little servant girl to lumber up, I saw a gentleman
come along behind her (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>), take the heavy hod of coal out of her (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) hand,
carry it all the way up, put it down at a door near by, and walk away,
saying, with a kind nod and a foreign accent, <div class="bookquote">``It goes better so. The
little back is too young to haf such heaviness.''

 (<font color='red'><b>her</b></font>)</div><p/>Wasn't it good of him (<font color='blue'><b>gentleman</b></font>)? I like such things, for as Father says, trifles
show character. When I mentioned it to Mrs. K., that evening, she (<font color='blue'><b>K.</b></font>)
laughed, and said, <div class="bookquote">``That must have been Professor Bhaer, he (<font color='blue'><b>Professor</b></font>)'s always
doing things of that sort.''

 (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div><p/>Mrs. K. told me he (<font color='blue'><b>Father</b></font>) was from Berlin, very learned and good, but poor as
a church mouse, and gives lessons to support himself and two little
orphan nephews whom he (<font color='blue'><b>Father</b></font>) is educating here, according to the wishes of
his (<font color='blue'><b>Father</b></font>) sister, who married an American. Not a very romantic story, but it
interested me, and I was glad to hear that Mrs. K. lends him (<font color='blue'><b>Father</b></font>) her (<font color='blue'><b>K.</b></font>)
parlor for some of his (<font color='blue'><b>Father</b></font>) scholars. There is a glass door between it and
the nursery, and I mean to peep at him (<font color='blue'><b>Father</b></font>), and then I'll tell you how he (<font color='blue'><b>Father</b></font>)
looks. He (<font color='blue'><b>Father</b></font>)'s almost forty, so it's no harm, Marmee.

<p/>After tea and a go-to-bed romp with the little girls, I attacked the
big workbasket, and had a quiet evening chatting with my new friend. I
shall keep a journal-letter, and send it once a week, so goodnight, and
more tomorrow.

<p/>Tuesday Eve

<p/>Had a lively time in my seminary this morning, for the children acted
like Sancho, and at one time I really thought I should shake them all
round. Some good angel inspired me to try gymnastics, and I kept it up
till they were glad to sit down and keep still. After luncheon, the
girl took them out for a walk, and I went to my needlework like little
Mabel `with a willing mind'. I was thanking my stars that I'd learned
to make nice buttonholes, when the parlor door opened and shut, and
someone began to hum, Kennst Du Das Land, like a big bumblebee. It was
dreadfully improper, I know, but I couldn't resist the temptation, and
lifting one end of the curtain before the glass door, I peeped in.
Professor Bhaer was there, and while he (<font color='blue'><b>Professor</b></font>) arranged his (<font color='blue'><b>Professor</b></font>) books, I took a
good look at him (<font color='blue'><b>Professor</b></font>). A regular German--rather stout, with brown hair
tumbled all over his (<font color='blue'><b>Professor</b></font>) head, a bushy beard, good nose, the kindest eyes I
ever saw, and a splendid big voice that does one's ears good, after our
sharp or slipshod American gabble. His (<font color='blue'><b>Professor</b></font>) clothes were rusty, his (<font color='blue'><b>Professor</b></font>) hands
were large, and he (<font color='blue'><b>Professor</b></font>) hadn't a really handsome feature in his (<font color='blue'><b>Professor</b></font>) face, except
his (<font color='blue'><b>Professor</b></font>) beautiful teeth, yet I liked him (<font color='blue'><b>Professor</b></font>), for he (<font color='blue'><b>Professor</b></font>) had a fine head, his (<font color='blue'><b>Professor</b></font>) linen
was very nice, and he (<font color='blue'><b>Professor</b></font>) looked like a gentleman, though two buttons were
off his (<font color='blue'><b>Professor</b></font>) coat and there was a patch on one shoe. He (<font color='blue'><b>Professor</b></font>) looked sober in
spite of his (<font color='blue'><b>Professor</b></font>) humming, till he (<font color='blue'><b>Professor</b></font>) went to the window to turn the hyacinth
bulbs toward the sun, and stroke the cat, who received him (<font color='blue'><b>Professor</b></font>) like an old
friend. Then he (<font color='blue'><b>friend</b></font>) smiled, and when a tap came at the door, called out in
a loud, brisk tone, <div class="bookquote">``Herein!''

 (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div><p/>I was just going to run, when I caught sight of a morsel of a child
carrying a big book, and stopped, to see what was going on.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Me wants me Bhaer,''  (<font color='red'><b>him</b></font>)</div>said the mite, slamming down her (<font color='blue'><b>Professor</b></font>) book and running
to meet him (<font color='blue'><b>friend</b></font>).

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Thou shalt haf thy Bhaer. Come, then, and take a goot hug from him (<font color='blue'><b>Professor</b></font>),
my Tina,''  (<font color='red'><b>the Professor</b></font>)</div>said the Professor, catching her (<font color='blue'><b>Professor</b></font>) up with a laugh, and holding
her (<font color='blue'><b>Professor</b></font>) so high over his (<font color='blue'><b>Professor</b></font>) head that she (<font color='blue'><b>Professor</b></font>) had to stoop her (<font color='blue'><b>Professor</b></font>) little face to kiss
him (<font color='blue'><b>Professor</b></font>).

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Now me mus tuddy my lessin,''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>went on the funny little thing. So he (<font color='blue'><b>Professor</b></font>)
put her (<font color='blue'><b>Professor</b></font>) up at the table, opened the great dictionary she (<font color='blue'><b>Professor</b></font>) had brought,
and gave her (<font color='blue'><b>Professor</b></font>) a paper and pencil, and she (<font color='blue'><b>Professor</b></font>) scribbled away, turning a leaf
now and then, and passing her (<font color='blue'><b>Professor</b></font>) little fat finger down the page, as if
finding a word, so soberly that I nearly betrayed myself by a laugh,
while Mr. Bhaer stood stroking her (<font color='blue'><b>Professor</b></font>) pretty hair with a fatherly look
that made me think she (<font color='blue'><b>Professor</b></font>) must be his (<font color='blue'><b>Bhaer</b></font>) own, though she (<font color='blue'><b>Professor</b></font>) looked more French
than German.

<p/>Another knock and the appearance of two young ladies sent me back to my
work, and there I virtuously remained through all the noise and
gabbling that went on next door. One of the girls kept laughing
affectedly, and saying, <div class="bookquote">``Now Professor,''  (<font color='red'><b>the girls</b></font>)</div>in a coquettish tone, and the
other pronounced her (<font color='blue'><b>Professor</b></font>) German with an accent that must have made it hard
for him (<font color='blue'><b>Bhaer</b></font>) to keep sober.

<p/>Both seemed to try his (<font color='blue'><b>Bhaer</b></font>) patience sorely, for more than once I heard him (<font color='blue'><b>Bhaer</b></font>)
say emphatically, <div class="bookquote">``No, no, it is not so, you haf not attend to what I
say,''  (<font color='red'><b>him</b></font>)</div>and once there was a loud rap, as if he (<font color='blue'><b>Bhaer</b></font>) struck the table with his (<font color='blue'><b>Bhaer</b></font>)
book, followed by the despairing exclamation, <div class="bookquote">``Prut! It all goes bad
this day.''

 (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div><p/>Poor man, I pitied him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>), and when the girls were gone, took just one
more peep to see if he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) survived it. He (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) seemed to have thrown himself
back in his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) chair, tired out, and sat there with his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) eyes shut till the
clock struck two, when he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) jumped up, put his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) books in his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) pocket, as if
ready for another lesson, and taking little Tina who had fallen asleep
on the sofa in his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) arms, he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) carried her (<font color='blue'><b>Tina</b></font>) quietly away. I fancy he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) has a
hard life of it. Mrs. Kirke asked me if I wouldn't go down to the five
o'clock dinner, and feeling a little bit homesick, I thought I would,
just to see what sort of people are under the same roof with me. So I
made myself respectable and tried to slip in behind Mrs. Kirke, but as
she (<font color='blue'><b>Kirke</b></font>) is short and I'm tall, my efforts at concealment were rather a
failure. She (<font color='blue'><b>Kirke</b></font>) gave me a seat by her (<font color='blue'><b>Kirke</b></font>), and after my face cooled off, I
plucked up courage and looked about me. The long table was full, and
every one intent on getting their dinner, the gentlemen especially, who
seemed to be eating on time, for they bolted in every sense of the
word, vanishing as soon as they were done. There was the usual
assortment of young men absorbed in themselves, young couples absorbed
in each other, married ladies in their babies, and old gentlemen in
politics. I don't think I shall care to have much to do with any of
them, except one sweetfaced maiden lady, who looks as if she (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) had
something in her (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>).

<p/>Cast away at the very bottom of the table was the Professor, shouting
answers to the questions of a very inquisitive, deaf old gentleman on
one side, and talking philosophy with a Frenchman on the other. If Amy
had been here, she (<font color='blue'><b>Amy</b></font>)'d have turned her (<font color='blue'><b>Amy</b></font>) back on him (<font color='blue'><b>Frenchman</b></font>) forever because, sad
to relate, he (<font color='blue'><b>Frenchman</b></font>) had a great appetite, and shoveled in his (<font color='blue'><b>Frenchman</b></font>) dinner in a
manner which would have horrified `her (<font color='blue'><b>Amy</b></font>) ladyship'. I didn't mind, for I
like `to see folks eat with a relish', as Hannah says, and the poor man
must have needed a deal of food after teaching idiots all day.

<p/>As I went upstairs after dinner, two of the young men were settling
their hats before the hall mirror, and I heard one say low to the
other, <div class="bookquote">``Who's the new party?''

 (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Governess, or something of that sort.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``What the deuce is she (<font color='blue'><b>Tina</b></font>) at our table for?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Friend of the old lady's.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Handsome head, but no style.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Not a bit of it. Give us a light and come on.''

 (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div><p/>I felt angry at first, and then I didn't care, for a governess is as
good as a clerk, and I've got sense, if I haven't style, which is more
than some people have, judging from the remarks of the elegant beings
who clattered away, smoking like bad chimneys. I hate ordinary people!


<p/>Thursday

<p/>Yesterday was a quiet day spent in teaching, sewing, and writing in my
little room, which is very cozy, with a light and fire. I picked up a
few bits of news and was introduced to the Professor. It seems that
Tina is the child of the Frenchwoman who does the fine ironing in the
laundry here. The little thing has lost her (<font color='blue'><b>Tina</b></font>) heart to Mr. Bhaer, and
follows him (<font color='blue'><b>Bhaer</b></font>) about the house like a dog whenever he (<font color='blue'><b>Bhaer</b></font>) is at home, which
delights him (<font color='blue'><b>Bhaer</b></font>), as he (<font color='blue'><b>Bhaer</b></font>) is very fond of children, though a `bacheldore'.
Kitty and Minnie Kirke likewise regard him (<font color='blue'><b>Bhaer</b></font>) with affection, and tell all
sorts of stories about the plays he (<font color='blue'><b>Bhaer</b></font>) invents, the presents he (<font color='blue'><b>Bhaer</b></font>) brings,
and the splendid tales he (<font color='blue'><b>Bhaer</b></font>) tells. The younger men quiz him (<font color='blue'><b>Bhaer</b></font>), it seems,
call him (<font color='blue'><b>Bhaer</b></font>) Old Fritz, Lager Beer, Ursa Major, and make all manner of
jokes on his (<font color='blue'><b>Major</b></font>) name. But he (<font color='blue'><b>Major</b></font>) enjoys it like a boy, Mrs. Kirke says, and
takes it so good-naturedly that they all like him (<font color='blue'><b>Major</b></font>) in spite of his (<font color='blue'><b>Major</b></font>)
foreign ways.

<p/>The maiden lady is a Miss Norton, rich, cultivated, and kind. She (<font color='blue'><b>Norton</b></font>)
spoke to me at dinner today -LRB-for I went to table again, it's such fun
to watch people-RRB-, and asked me to come and see her (<font color='blue'><b>Norton</b></font>) at her (<font color='blue'><b>Norton</b></font>) room. She (<font color='blue'><b>Norton</b></font>)
has fine books and pictures, knows interesting persons, and seems
friendly, so I shall make myself agreeable, for I do want to get into
good society, only it isn't the same sort that Amy likes.

<p/>I was in our parlor last evening when Mr. Bhaer came in with some
newspapers for Mrs. Kirke. She (<font color='blue'><b>Kirke</b></font>) wasn't there, but Minnie, who is a
little old woman, introduced me very prettily. <div class="bookquote">``This is Mamma's friend,
Miss March.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Yes, and she (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>)'s jolly and we like her (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) lots,''  (<font color='red'><b>Kitty/Kitty Bryant</b></font>)</div>added Kitty, who is an
`enfant terrible'.

<p/>We both bowed, and then we laughed, for the prim introduction and the
blunt addition were rather a comical contrast.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Ah, yes, I hear these naughty ones go to vex you, Mees Marsch. If so
again, call at me and I come,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Bhaer</b></font>) said, with a threatening frown that
delighted the little wretches.

<p/>I promised I would, and he (<font color='blue'><b>Bhaer</b></font>) departed, but it seems as if I was doomed to
see a good deal of him (<font color='blue'><b>Bhaer</b></font>), for today as I passed his (<font color='blue'><b>Bhaer</b></font>) door on my way out,
by accident I knocked against it with my umbrella. It flew open, and
there he (<font color='blue'><b>Bhaer</b></font>) stood in his (<font color='blue'><b>Bhaer</b></font>) dressing gown, with a big blue sock on one hand
and a darning needle in the other. He (<font color='blue'><b>Bhaer</b></font>) didn't seem at all ashamed of
it, for when I explained and hurried on, he (<font color='blue'><b>Bhaer</b></font>) waved his (<font color='blue'><b>Bhaer</b></font>) hand, sock and
all, saying in his (<font color='blue'><b>Bhaer</b></font>) loud, cheerful way...

<p/><div class="bookquote">``You haf a fine day to make your walk. Bon voyage, Mademoiselle.''

 (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div><p/>I laughed all the way downstairs, but it was a little pathetic, also to
think of the poor man having to mend his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) own clothes. The German
gentlemen embroider, I know, but darning hose is another thing and not
so pretty.


<p/>Saturday

<p/>Nothing has happened to write about, except a call on Miss Norton, who
has a room full of pretty things, and who was very charming, for she (<font color='blue'><b>Norton</b></font>)
showed me all her (<font color='blue'><b>Norton</b></font>) treasures, and asked me if I would sometimes go with
her (<font color='blue'><b>Norton</b></font>) to lectures and concerts, as her (<font color='blue'><b>Norton</b></font>) escort, if I enjoyed them. She (<font color='blue'><b>Norton</b></font>)
put it as a favor, but I'm sure Mrs. Kirke has told her (<font color='blue'><b>Kirke</b></font>) about us, and
she (<font color='blue'><b>Kirke</b></font>) does it out of kindness to me. I'm as proud as Lucifer, but such
favors from such people don't burden me, and I accepted gratefully.

<p/>When I got back to the nursery there was such an uproar in the parlor
that I looked in, and there was Mr. Bhaer down on his (<font color='blue'><b>Bhaer</b></font>) hands and knees,
with Tina on his (<font color='blue'><b>Bhaer</b></font>) back, Kitty leading him (<font color='blue'><b>Bhaer</b></font>) with a jump rope, and Minnie
feeding two small boys with seedcakes, as they roared and ramped in
cages built of chairs.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``We are playing nargerie,''  (<font color='red'><b>Kitty/Kitty Bryant</b></font>)</div>explained Kitty.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Dis is mine effalunt!''  (<font color='red'><b>Tina</b></font>)</div>added Tina, holding on by the Professor's hair.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Mamma always allows us to do what we like Saturday afternoon, when
Franz and Emil come, doesn't she (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>), Mr. Bhaer?''  (<font color='red'><b>Minnie</b></font>)</div>said Minnie.

<p/>The `effalunt' sat up, looking as much in earnest as any of them, and
said soberly to me, <div class="bookquote">``I gif you my wort it is so, if we make too large a
noise you shall say Hush! to us, and we go more softly.''

 (<font color='red'><b>me</b></font>)</div><p/>I promised to do so, but left the door open and enjoyed the fun as much
as they did, for a more glorious frolic I never witnessed. They played
tag and soldiers, danced and sang, and when it began to grow dark they
all piled onto the sofa about the Professor, while he (<font color='blue'><b>Professor</b></font>) told charming
fairy stories of the storks on the chimney tops, and the little
`koblods', who ride the snowflakes as they fall. I wish Americans were
as simple and natural as Germans, don't you?

<p/>I'm so fond of writing, I should go spinning on forever if motives of
economy didn't stop me, for though I've used thin paper and written
fine, I tremble to think of the stamps this long letter will need.
Pray forward Amy's as soon as you can spare them. My small news will
sound very flat after her (<font color='blue'><b>Amy</b></font>) splendors, but you will like them, I know.
Is Teddy studying so hard that he (<font color='blue'><b>Teddy</b></font>) can't find time to write to his (<font color='blue'><b>Teddy</b></font>)
friends? Take good care of him (<font color='blue'><b>Teddy</b></font>) for me, Beth, and tell me all about the
babies, and give heaps of love to everyone. From your faithful Jo.

<p/>P.S. On reading over my letter, it strikes me as rather Bhaery, but I
am always interested in odd people, and I really had nothing else to
write about. Bless you!

<p/>DECEMBER

<p/>My Precious Betsey,

<p/>As this is to be a scribble-scrabble letter, I direct it to you, for it
may amuse you, and give you some idea of my goings on, for though
quiet, they are rather amusing, for which, oh, be joyful! After what
Amy would call Herculaneum efforts, in the way of mental and moral
agriculture, my young ideas begin to shoot and my little twigs to bend
as I could wish. They are not so interesting to me as Tina and the
boys, but I do my duty by them, and they are fond of me. Franz and
Emil are jolly little lads, quite after my own heart, for the mixture
of German and American spirit in them produces a constant state of
effervescence. Saturday afternoons are riotous times, whether spent in
the house or out, for on pleasant days they all go to walk, like a
seminary, with the Professor and myself to keep order, and then such
fun!

<p/>We are very good friends now, and I've begun to take lessons. I really
couldn't help it, and it all came about in such a droll way that I must
tell you. To begin at the beginning, Mrs. Kirke called to me one day
as I passed Mr. Bhaer's room where she (<font color='blue'><b>Kirke</b></font>) was rummaging.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Did you ever see such a den, my dear? Just come and help me put these
books to rights, for I've turned everything upside down, trying to
discover what he (<font color='blue'><b>Bhaer</b></font>) has done with the six new handkerchiefs I gave him (<font color='blue'><b>Bhaer</b></font>) not
long ago.''

 (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div><p/>I went in, and while we worked I looked about me, for it was 'a den' to
be sure. Books and papers everywhere, a broken meerschaum, and an old
flute over the mantlepiece as if done with, a ragged bird without any
tail chirped on one window seat, and a box of white mice adorned the
other. Half-finished boats and bits of string lay among the
manuscripts. Dirty little boots stood drying before the fire, and
traces of the dearly beloved boys, for whom he (<font color='blue'><b>Kirke</b></font>) makes a slave of
himself, were to be seen all over the room. After a grand rummage
three of the missing articles were found, one over the bird cage, one
covered with ink, and a third burned brown, having been used as a
holder.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Such a man!''  (<font color='red'><b>Mrs. K.</b></font>)</div>laughed good-natured Mrs. K., as she (<font color='blue'><b>K.</b></font>) put the relics in
the rag bag. <div class="bookquote">``I suppose the others are torn up to rig ships, bandage
cut fingers, or make kite tails. It's dreadful, but I can't scold him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>).
He (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>)'s so absent-minded and goodnatured, he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) lets those boys ride over him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>)
roughshod. I agreed to do his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) washing and mending, but he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) forgets to
give out his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) things and I forget to look them over, so he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) comes to a
sad pass sometimes.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Let me mend them,''  (<font color='red'><b>I.</b></font>)</div>said I. <div class="bookquote">``I don't mind it, and he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) needn't know.
I'd like to, he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>)'s so kind to me about bringing my letters and lending
books.''

 (<font color='red'><b>I.</b></font>)</div><p/>So I have got his (<font color='blue'><b>Kirke</b></font>) things in order, and knit heels into two pairs of the
socks, for they were boggled out of shape with his (<font color='blue'><b>Kirke</b></font>) queer darns.
Nothing was said, and I hoped he (<font color='blue'><b>Kirke</b></font>) wouldn't find it out, but one day last
week he (<font color='blue'><b>Kirke</b></font>) caught me at it. Hearing the lessons he (<font color='blue'><b>Kirke</b></font>) gives to others has
interested and amused me so much that I took a fancy to learn, for Tina
runs in and out, leaving the door open, and I can hear. I had been
sitting near this door, finishing off the last sock, and trying to
understand what he (<font color='blue'><b>Kirke</b></font>) said to a new scholar, who is as stupid as I am.
The girl had gone, and I thought he (<font color='blue'><b>Kirke</b></font>) had also, it was so still, and I
was busily gabbling over a verb, and rocking to and fro in a most
absurd way, when a little crow made me look up, and there was Mr. Bhaer
looking and laughing quietly, while he (<font color='blue'><b>Bhaer</b></font>) made signs to Tina not to betray
him (<font color='blue'><b>Bhaer</b></font>).

<p/><div class="bookquote">``So!''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Bhaer</b></font>) said, as I stopped and stared like a goose, <div class="bookquote">``you peep at me, I
peep at you, and this is not bad, but see, I am not pleasanting when I
say, haf you a wish for German?''

 (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Yes, but you are too busy. I am too stupid to learn,''  (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div>I blundered
out, as red as a peony.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Prut! We will make the time, and we fail not to find the sense. At
efening I shall gif a little lesson with much gladness, for look you,
Mees Marsch, I haf this debt to pay.''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>And he (<font color='blue'><b>Bhaer</b></font>) pointed to my work <div class="bookquote">``Yes,''
 (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>they say to one another, these so kind ladies, `he (<font color='blue'><b>Bhaer</b></font>) is a stupid old
fellow, he (<font color='blue'><b>Bhaer</b></font>) will see not what we do, he (<font color='blue'><b>Bhaer</b></font>) will never observe that his (<font color='blue'><b>Bhaer</b></font>) sock
heels go not in holes any more, he (<font color='blue'><b>Bhaer</b></font>) will think his (<font color='blue'><b>Bhaer</b></font>) buttons grow out new
when they fall, and believe that strings make theirselves.'' <div class="bookquote">``Ah! But I
haf an eye, and I see much. I haf a heart, and I feel thanks for this.
Come, a little lesson then and now, or--no more good fairy works for me
and mine.''

 (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div><p/>Of course I couldn't say anything after that, and as it really is a
splendid opportunity, I made the bargain, and we began. I took four
lessons, and then I stuck fast in a grammatical bog. The Professor was
very patient with me, but it must have been torment to him (<font color='blue'><b>Professor</b></font>), and now and
then he (<font color='blue'><b>Professor</b></font>)'d look at me with such an expression of mild despair that it
was a toss-up with me whether to laugh or cry. I tried both ways, and
when it came to a sniff or utter mortification and woe, he (<font color='blue'><b>Professor</b></font>) just threw
the grammar on to the floor and marched out of the room. I felt myself
disgraced and deserted forever, but didn't blame him (<font color='blue'><b>Professor</b></font>) a particle, and
was scrambling my papers together, meaning to rush upstairs and shake
myself hard, when in he (<font color='blue'><b>Professor</b></font>) came, as brisk and beaming as if I'd covered
myself in glory.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Now we shall try a new way. You and I will read these pleasant little
_marchen_ together, and dig no more in that dry book, that goes in the
corner for making us trouble.''

 (<font color='red'><b>He</b></font>)</div><p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Professor</b></font>) spoke so kindly, and opened Hans Anderson's fairy tales so
invitingly before me, that I was more ashamed than ever, and went at my
lesson in a neck-or-nothing style that seemed to amuse him (<font color='blue'><b>Anderson</b></font>) immensely.
I forgot my bashfulness, and pegged away -LRB-no other word will express
it-RRB- with all my might, tumbling over long words, pronouncing according
to inspiration of the minute, and doing my very best. When I finished
reading my first page, and stopped for breath, he (<font color='blue'><b>Anderson</b></font>) clapped his (<font color='blue'><b>Anderson</b></font>) hands and
cried out in his (<font color='blue'><b>Anderson</b></font>) hearty way, <div class="bookquote">``Das ist gut! Now we go well! My turn. I
do him (<font color='blue'><b>You</b></font>) in German, gif me your ear.''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>And away he (<font color='blue'><b>Anderson</b></font>) went, rumbling out the
words with his (<font color='blue'><b>Anderson</b></font>) strong voice and a relish which was good to see as well
as hear. Fortunately the story was _The Constant Tin Soldier_, which
is droll, you know, so I could laugh, and I did, though I didn't
understand half he (<font color='blue'><b>Soldier</b></font>) read, for I couldn't help it, he (<font color='blue'><b>Soldier</b></font>) was so earnest, I
so excited, and the whole thing so comical.

<p/>After that we got on better, and now I read my lessons pretty well, for
this way of studying suits me, and I can see that the grammar gets
tucked into the tales and poetry as one gives pills in jelly. I like
it very much, and he (<font color='blue'><b>Soldier</b></font>) doesn't seem tired of it yet, which is very good
of him (<font color='blue'><b>Soldier</b></font>), isn't it? I mean to give him (<font color='blue'><b>Soldier</b></font>) something on Christmas, for I
dare not offer money. Tell me something nice, Marmee.

<p/>I'm glad Laurie seems so happy and busy, that he (<font color='blue'><b>Laurie</b></font>) has given up smoking
and lets his (<font color='blue'><b>Laurie</b></font>) hair grow. You see Beth manages him (<font color='blue'><b>Laurie</b></font>) better than I did.
I'm not jealous, dear, do your best, only don't make a saint of him (<font color='blue'><b>saint</b></font>).
I'm afraid I couldn't like him (<font color='blue'><b>saint</b></font>) without a spice of human naughtiness.
Read him (<font color='blue'><b>saint</b></font>) bits of my letters. I haven't time to write much, and that
will do just as well. Thank Heaven Beth continues so comfortable.

<p/>JANUARY

<p/>A Happy New Year to you all, my dearest family, which of course
includes Mr. L. and a young man by the name of Teddy. I can't tell you
how much I enjoyed your Christmas bundle, for I didn't get it till
night and had given up hoping. Your letter came in the morning, but
you said nothing about a parcel, meaning it for a surprise, so I was
disappointed, for I'd had a `kind of feeling' that you wouldn't forget
me. I felt a little low in my mind as I sat up in my room after tea,
and when the big, muddy, battered-looking bundle was brought to me, I
just hugged it and pranced. It was so homey and refreshing that I sat
down on the floor and read and looked and ate and laughed and cried, in
my usual absurd way. The things were just what I wanted, and all the
better for being made instead of bought. Beth's new `ink bib' was
capital, and Hannah's box of hard gingerbread will be a treasure. I'll
be sure and wear the nice flannels you sent, Marmee, and read carefully
the books Father has marked. Thank you all, heaps and heaps!

<p/>Speaking of books reminds me that I'm getting rich in that line, for on
New Year's Day Mr. Bhaer gave me a fine Shakespeare. It is one he (<font color='blue'><b>Bhaer</b></font>)
values much, and I've often admired it, set up in the place of honor
with his (<font color='blue'><b>Bhaer</b></font>) German Bible, Plato, Homer, and Milton, so you may imagine how
I felt when he (<font color='blue'><b>Milton</b></font>) brought it down, without its cover, and showed me my own
name in it, <div class="bookquote">``from my friend Friedrich Bhaer'' (<font color='red'><b>me</b></font>)</div>.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``You say often you wish a library. Here I gif you one, for between
these lids -LRB-he (<font color='blue'><b>Bhaer</b></font>) meant covers-RRB- is many books in one. Read him (<font color='blue'><b>Bhaer</b></font>) well, and
he (<font color='blue'><b>Bhaer</b></font>) will help you much, for the study of character in this book will
help you to read it in the world and paint it with your pen.''

 (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div><p/>I thanked him (<font color='blue'><b>Milton</b></font>) as well as I could, and talk now about `my library', as
if I had a hundred books. I never knew how much there was in
Shakespeare before, but then I never had a Bhaer to explain it to me.
Now don't laugh at his (<font color='blue'><b>Shakespeare</b></font>) horrid name. It isn't pronounced either Bear or
Beer, as people will say it, but something between the two, as only
Germans can give it. I'm glad you both like what I tell you about him (<font color='blue'><b>Shakespeare</b></font>),
and hope you will know him (<font color='blue'><b>Shakespeare</b></font>) some day. Mother would admire his (<font color='blue'><b>Shakespeare</b></font>) warm
heart, Father his (<font color='blue'><b>Shakespeare</b></font>) wise head. I admire both, and feel rich in my new
`friend Friedrich Bhaer'.

<p/>Not having much money, or knowing what he (<font color='blue'><b>Bhaer</b></font>)'d like, I got several little
things, and put them about the room, where he (<font color='blue'><b>Bhaer</b></font>) would find them
unexpectedly. They were useful, pretty, or funny, a new standish on
his (<font color='blue'><b>Bhaer</b></font>) table, a little vase for his (<font color='blue'><b>Bhaer</b></font>) flower, he (<font color='blue'><b>Bhaer</b></font>) always has one, or a bit of
green in a glass, to keep him (<font color='blue'><b>Bhaer</b></font>) fresh, he (<font color='blue'><b>Bhaer</b></font>) says, and a holder for his (<font color='blue'><b>Bhaer</b></font>)
blower, so that he (<font color='blue'><b>Bhaer</b></font>) needn't burn up what Amy calls `mouchoirs'. I made
it like those Beth invented, a big butterfly with a fat body, and black
and yellow wings, worsted feelers, and bead eyes. It took his (<font color='blue'><b>Bhaer</b></font>) fancy
immensely, and he (<font color='blue'><b>Bhaer</b></font>) put it on his (<font color='blue'><b>Bhaer</b></font>) mantlepiece as an article of virtue, so
it was rather a failure after all. Poor as he (<font color='blue'><b>Bhaer</b></font>) is, he (<font color='blue'><b>Bhaer</b></font>) didn't forget a
servant or a child in the house, and not a soul here, from the French
laundrywoman to Miss Norton forgot him (<font color='blue'><b>Bhaer</b></font>). I was so glad of that.

<p/>They got up a masquerade, and had a gay time New Year's Eve. I didn't
mean to go down, having no dress. But at the last minute, Mrs. Kirke
remembered some old brocades, and Miss Norton lent me lace and
feathers. So I dressed up as Mrs. Malaprop, and sailed in with a mask
on. No one knew me, for I disguised my voice, and no one dreamed of
the silent, haughty Miss March -LRB-for they think I am very stiff and
cool, most of them, and so I am to whippersnappers-RRB- could dance and
dress, and burst out into a `nice derangement of epitaphs, like an
allegory on the banks of the Nile'. I enjoyed it very much, and when
we unmasked it was fun to see them stare at me. I heard one of the
young men tell another that he (<font color='blue'><b>they</b></font>) knew I'd been an actress, in fact, he (<font color='blue'><b>they</b></font>)
thought he (<font color='blue'><b>they</b></font>) remembered seeing me at one of the minor theaters. Meg will
relish that joke. Mr. Bhaer was Nick Bottom, and Tina was Titania, a
perfect little fairy in his (<font color='blue'><b>Bhaer</b></font>) arms. To see them dance was `quite a
landscape', to use a Teddyism.

<p/>I had a very happy New Year, after all, and when I thought it over in
my room, I felt as if I was getting on a little in spite of my many
failures, for I'm cheerful all the time now, work with a will, and take
more interest in other people than I used to, which is satisfactory.
Bless you all! Ever your loving... Jo



<p/>CHAPTER THIRTY-FOUR

<p/>FRIEND

<p/>Though very happy in the social atmosphere about her (<font color='blue'><b>Jo</b></font>), and very busy
with the daily work that earned her (<font color='blue'><b>Jo</b></font>) bread and made it sweeter for the
effort, Jo still found time for literary labors. The purpose which now
took possession of her (<font color='blue'><b>Jo</b></font>) was a natural one to a poor and ambitious girl,
but the means she (<font color='blue'><b>Jo</b></font>) took to gain her (<font color='blue'><b>Jo</b></font>) end were not the best. She (<font color='blue'><b>Jo</b></font>) saw that
money conferred power, money and power, therefore, she (<font color='blue'><b>Jo</b></font>) resolved to
have, not to be used for herself alone, but for those whom she (<font color='blue'><b>Jo</b></font>) loved
more than life. The dream of filling home with comforts, giving Beth
everything she (<font color='blue'><b>Beth</b></font>) wanted, from strawberries in winter to an organ in her (<font color='blue'><b>Beth</b></font>)
bedroom, going abroad herself, and always having more than enough, so
that she (<font color='blue'><b>Beth</b></font>) might indulge in the luxury of charity, had been for years
Jo's most cherished castle in the air.

<p/>The prize-story experience had seemed to open a way which might, after
long traveling and much uphill work, lead to this delightful chateau en
Espagne. But the novel disaster quenched her (<font color='blue'><b>Jo</b></font>) courage for a time, for
public opinion is a giant which has frightened stouter-hearted Jacks on
bigger beanstalks than hers. Like that immortal hero, she (<font color='blue'><b>Jo</b></font>) reposed
awhile after the first attempt, which resulted in a tumble and the
least lovely of the giant's treasures, if I remember rightly. But the
`up again and take another' spirit was as strong in Jo as in Jack, so
she (<font color='blue'><b>Jo</b></font>) scrambled up on the shady side this time and got more booty, but
nearly left behind her (<font color='blue'><b>Jo</b></font>) what was far more precious than the moneybags.

<p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>Jo</b></font>) took to writing sensation stories, for in those dark ages, even
all-perfect America read rubbish. She (<font color='blue'><b>Jo</b></font>) told no one, but concocted a
`thrilling tale', and boldly carried it herself to Mr. Dashwood, editor
of the Weekly Volcano. She (<font color='blue'><b>Jo</b></font>) had never read Sartor Resartus, but she (<font color='blue'><b>Jo</b></font>) had
a womanly instinct that clothes possess an influence more powerful over
many than the worth of character or the magic of manners. So she (<font color='blue'><b>Jo</b></font>)
dressed herself in her (<font color='blue'><b>Jo</b></font>) best, and trying to persuade herself that she (<font color='blue'><b>Jo</b></font>)
was neither excited nor nervous, bravely climbed two pairs of dark and
dirty stairs to find herself in a disorderly room, a cloud of cigar
smoke, and the presence of three gentlemen, sitting with their heels
rather higher than their hats, which articles of dress none of them
took the trouble to remove on her (<font color='blue'><b>Jo</b></font>) appearance. Somewhat daunted by this
reception, Jo hesitated on the threshold, murmuring in much
embarrassment...

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Excuse me, I was looking for the Weekly Volcano office. I wished to
see Mr. Dashwood.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Jo/Miss Jo/JO</b></font>)</div><p/>Down went the highest pair of heels, up rose the smokiest gentleman,
and carefully cherishing his (<font color='blue'><b>gentleman</b></font>) cigar between his (<font color='blue'><b>gentleman</b></font>) fingers, he (<font color='blue'><b>gentleman</b></font>) advanced
with a nod and a countenance expressive of nothing but sleep. Feeling
that she (<font color='blue'><b>Jo</b></font>) must get through the matter somehow, Jo produced her (<font color='blue'><b>Jo</b></font>)
manuscript and, blushing redder and redder with each sentence,
blundered out fragments of the little speech carefully prepared for the
occasion.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``A friend of mine desired me to offer--a story--just as an
experiment--would like your opinion--be glad to write more if this
suits.''

 (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div><p/>While she (<font color='blue'><b>Jo</b></font>) blushed and blundered, Mr. Dashwood had taken the manuscript,
and was turning over the leaves with a pair of rather dirty fingers,
and casting critical glances up and down the neat pages.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Not a first attempt, I take it?''  (<font color='red'><b>a novice</b></font>)</div>observing that the pages were
numbered, covered only on one side, and not tied up with a ribbon--sure
sign of a novice.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``No, sir. She (<font color='blue'><b>you</b></font>) has had some experience, and got a prize for a tale in
the _Blarneystone Banner_.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Oh, did she (<font color='blue'><b>you</b></font>)?''  (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Dashwood</b></font>)</div>and Mr. Dashwood gave Jo a quick look, which seemed to
take note of everything she (<font color='blue'><b>Jo</b></font>) had on, from the bow in her (<font color='blue'><b>Jo</b></font>) bonnet to the
buttons on her (<font color='blue'><b>Jo</b></font>) boots. <div class="bookquote">``Well, you can leave it, if you like. We've
more of this sort of thing on hand than we know what to do with at
present, but I'll run my eye over it, and give you an answer next week.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Jo/Miss Jo/JO</b></font>)</div><p/>Now, Jo did _not_ like to leave it, for Mr. Dashwood didn't suit her (<font color='blue'><b>Jo</b></font>) at
all, but, under the circumstances, there was nothing for her (<font color='blue'><b>Jo</b></font>) to do but
bow and walk away, looking particularly tall and dignified, as she (<font color='blue'><b>Jo</b></font>) was
apt to do when nettled or abashed. Just then she (<font color='blue'><b>Jo</b></font>) was both, for it was
perfectly evident from the knowing glances exchanged among the
gentlemen that her (<font color='blue'><b>Jo</b></font>) little fiction of `my friend' was considered a good
joke, and a laugh, produced by some inaudible remark of the editor, as
he (<font color='blue'><b>editor</b></font>) closed the door, completed her (<font color='blue'><b>Jo</b></font>) discomfiture. Half resolving never
to return, she (<font color='blue'><b>Jo</b></font>) went home, and worked off her (<font color='blue'><b>Jo</b></font>) irritation by stitching
pinafores vigorously, and in an hour or two was cool enough to laugh
over the scene and long for next week.

<p/>When she (<font color='blue'><b>Jo</b></font>) went again, Mr. Dashwood was alone, whereat she (<font color='blue'><b>Jo</b></font>) rejoiced. Mr.
Dashwood was much wider awake than before, which was agreeable, and Mr.
Dashwood was not too deeply absorbed in a cigar to remember his (<font color='blue'><b>Dashwood</b></font>)
manners, so the second interview was much more comfortable than the
first.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``We'll take this -LRB-editors never say I-RRB-, if you don't object to a few
alterations. It's too long, but omitting the passages I've marked will
make it just the right length,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Dashwood</b></font>) said, in a businesslike tone.

<p/>Jo hardly knew her (<font color='blue'><b>Jo</b></font>) own MS. again, so crumpled and underscored were its
pages and paragraphs, but feeling as a tender parent might on being
asked to cut off her (<font color='blue'><b>Jo</b></font>) baby's legs in order that it might fit into a new
cradle, she (<font color='blue'><b>Jo</b></font>) looked at the marked passages and was surprised to find
that all the moral reflections--which she (<font color='blue'><b>Jo</b></font>) had carefully put in as
ballast for much romance--had been stricken out.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``But, Sir, I thought every story should have some sort of a moral, so I
took care to have a few of my sinners repent.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Mr.</b></font>)</div><p/>Mr. Dashwoods's editorial gravity relaxed into a smile, for Jo had
forgotten her (<font color='blue'><b>Jo</b></font>) `friend', and spoken as only an author could.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``People want to be amused, not preached at, you know. Morals don't
sell nowadays.''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>Which was not quite a correct statement, by the way.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``You think it would do with these alterations, then?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Yes, it's a new plot, and pretty well worked up--language good, and so
on,''  (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Dashwood</b></font>)</div>was Mr. Dashwood's affable reply.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``What do you--that is, what compensation--''  (<font color='red'><b>Jo/Miss Jo/JO</b></font>)</div>began Jo, not exactly
knowing how to express herself.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Oh, yes, well, we give from twenty-five to thirty for things of this
sort. Pay when it comes out,''  (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Dashwood</b></font>)</div>returned Mr. Dashwood, as if that point
had escaped him (<font color='blue'><b>Dashwood</b></font>). Such trifles do escape the editorial mind, it is said.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Very well, you can have it,''  (<font color='red'><b>Jo/Miss Jo/JO</b></font>)</div>said Jo, handing back the story with a
satisfied air, for after the dollar-a-column work, even twenty-five
seemed good pay.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Shall I tell my friend you will take another if she (<font color='blue'><b>you</b></font>) has one better
than this?''  (<font color='red'><b>Jo/Miss Jo/JO</b></font>)</div>asked Jo, unconscious of her (<font color='blue'><b>Jo</b></font>) little slip of the tongue, and
emboldened by her (<font color='blue'><b>Jo</b></font>) success.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Well, we'll look at it. Can't promise to take it. Tell her (<font color='blue'><b>you</b></font>) to make
it short and spicy, and never mind the moral. What name would your
friend like to put on it?''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>in a careless tone.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``None at all, if you please, she (<font color='blue'><b>you</b></font>) doesn't wish her (<font color='blue'><b>you</b></font>) name to appear and
has no nom de plume,''  (<font color='red'><b>Jo/Miss Jo/JO</b></font>)</div>said Jo, blushing in spite of herself.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Just as she (<font color='blue'><b>you</b></font>) likes, of course. The tale will be out next week. Will
you call for the money, or shall I send it?''  (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Dashwood</b></font>)</div>asked Mr. Dashwood, who
felt a natural desire to know who his (<font color='blue'><b>Dashwood</b></font>) new contributor might be.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``I'll call. Good morning, Sir.''

 (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div><p/>As she (<font color='blue'><b>Jo</b></font>) departed, Mr. Dashwood put up his (<font color='blue'><b>Dashwood</b></font>) feet, with the graceful
remark, <div class="bookquote">``Poor and proud, as usual, but she (<font color='blue'><b>you</b></font>)'ll do.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Dashwood</b></font>)</div><p/>Following Mr. Dashwood's directions, and making Mrs. Northbury her (<font color='blue'><b>Jo</b></font>)
model, Jo rashly took a plunge into the frothy sea of sensational
literature, but thanks to the life preserver thrown her (<font color='blue'><b>Jo</b></font>) by a friend,
she (<font color='blue'><b>Jo</b></font>) came up again not much the worse for her (<font color='blue'><b>Jo</b></font>) ducking.

<p/>Like most young scribblers, she (<font color='blue'><b>Jo</b></font>) went abroad for her (<font color='blue'><b>Jo</b></font>) characters and
scenery, and banditti, counts, gypsies, nuns, and duchesses appeared
upon her (<font color='blue'><b>Jo</b></font>) stage, and played their parts with as much accuracy and spirit
as could be expected. Her (<font color='blue'><b>Jo</b></font>) readers were not particular about such
trifles as grammar, punctuation, and probability, and Mr. Dashwood
graciously permitted her (<font color='blue'><b>Jo</b></font>) to fill his (<font color='blue'><b>Dashwood</b></font>) columns at the lowest prices, not
thinking it necessary to tell her (<font color='blue'><b>Jo</b></font>) that the real cause of his (<font color='blue'><b>Dashwood</b></font>)
hospitality was the fact that one of his (<font color='blue'><b>Dashwood</b></font>) hacks, on being offered higher
wages, had basely left him (<font color='blue'><b>Dashwood</b></font>) in the lurch.

<p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>Jo</b></font>) soon became interested in her (<font color='blue'><b>Jo</b></font>) work, for her (<font color='blue'><b>Jo</b></font>) emaciated purse grew
stout, and the little hoard she (<font color='blue'><b>Jo</b></font>) was making to take Beth to the
mountains next summer grew slowly but surely as the weeks passed. One
thing disturbed her (<font color='blue'><b>Jo</b></font>) satisfaction, and that was that she (<font color='blue'><b>Jo</b></font>) did not tell
them at home. She (<font color='blue'><b>Jo</b></font>) had a feeling that Father and Mother would not
approve, and preferred to have her (<font color='blue'><b>Mother</b></font>) own way first, and beg pardon
afterward. It was easy to keep her (<font color='blue'><b>Mother</b></font>) secret, for no name appeared with
her (<font color='blue'><b>Mother</b></font>) stories. Mr. Dashwood had of course found it out very soon, but
promised to be dumb, and for a wonder kept his (<font color='blue'><b>Dashwood</b></font>) word.

<p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>Mother</b></font>) thought it would do her (<font color='blue'><b>Mother</b></font>) no harm, for she (<font color='blue'><b>Mother</b></font>) sincerely meant to write
nothing of which she (<font color='blue'><b>Mother</b></font>) would be ashamed, and quieted all pricks of
conscience by anticipations of the happy minute when she (<font color='blue'><b>Mother</b></font>) should show
her (<font color='blue'><b>Mother</b></font>) earnings and laugh over her (<font color='blue'><b>Mother</b></font>) well-kept secret.

<p/>But Mr. Dashwood rejected any but thrilling tales, and as thrills could
not be produced except by harrowing up the souls of the readers,
history and romance, land and sea, science and art, police records and
lunatic asylums, had to be ransacked for the purpose. Jo soon found
that her (<font color='blue'><b>Jo</b></font>) innocent experience had given her (<font color='blue'><b>Jo</b></font>) but few glimpses of the
tragic world which underlies society, so regarding it in a business
light, she (<font color='blue'><b>Jo</b></font>) set about supplying her (<font color='blue'><b>Jo</b></font>) deficiencies with characteristic
energy. Eager to find material for stories, and bent on making them
original in plot, if not masterly in execution, she (<font color='blue'><b>Jo</b></font>) searched newspapers
for accidents, incidents, and crimes. She (<font color='blue'><b>Jo</b></font>) excited the suspicions of
public librarians by asking for works on poisons. She (<font color='blue'><b>Jo</b></font>) studied faces in
the street, and characters, good, bad, and indifferent, all about her (<font color='blue'><b>Jo</b></font>).
She (<font color='blue'><b>Jo</b></font>) delved in the dust of ancient times for facts or fictions so old
that they were as good as new, and introduced herself to folly, sin,
and misery, as well as her (<font color='blue'><b>Jo</b></font>) limited opportunities allowed. She (<font color='blue'><b>Jo</b></font>) thought
she (<font color='blue'><b>Jo</b></font>) was prospering finely, but unconsciously she (<font color='blue'><b>Jo</b></font>) was beginning to
desecrate some of the womanliest attributes of a woman's character.
She (<font color='blue'><b>Jo</b></font>) was living in bad society, and imaginary though it was, its
influence affected her (<font color='blue'><b>Jo</b></font>), for she (<font color='blue'><b>Jo</b></font>) was feeding heart and fancy on
dangerous and unsubstantial food, and was fast brushing the innocent
bloom from her (<font color='blue'><b>Jo</b></font>) nature by a premature acquaintance with the darker side
of life, which comes soon enough to all of us.

<p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>Jo</b></font>) was beginning to feel rather than see this, for much describing of
other people's passions and feelings set her (<font color='blue'><b>Jo</b></font>) to studying and
speculating about her (<font color='blue'><b>Jo</b></font>) own, a morbid amusement in which healthy young
minds do not voluntarily indulge. Wrongdoing always brings its own
punishment, and when Jo most needed hers, she (<font color='blue'><b>Jo</b></font>) got it.

<p/>I don't know whether the study of Shakespeare helped her (<font color='blue'><b>Jo</b></font>) to read
character, or the natural instinct of a woman for what was honest,
brave, and strong, but while endowing her (<font color='blue'><b>Jo</b></font>) imaginary heroes with every
perfection under the sun, Jo was discovering a live hero, who
interested her (<font color='blue'><b>Jo</b></font>) in spite of many human imperfections. Mr. Bhaer, in one
of their conversations, had advised her (<font color='blue'><b>Jo</b></font>) to study simple, true, and
lovely characters, wherever she (<font color='blue'><b>Jo</b></font>) found them, as good training for a
writer. Jo took him (<font color='blue'><b>writer</b></font>) at his (<font color='blue'><b>writer</b></font>) word, for she (<font color='blue'><b>Jo</b></font>) coolly turned round and
studied him (<font color='blue'><b>writer</b></font>)--a proceeding which would have much surprised him (<font color='blue'><b>writer</b></font>), had he (<font color='blue'><b>writer</b></font>)
known it, for the worthy Professor was very humble in his (<font color='blue'><b>Professor</b></font>) own conceit.

<p/>Why everybody liked him (<font color='blue'><b>Professor</b></font>) was what puzzled Jo, at first. He (<font color='blue'><b>Professor</b></font>) was neither
rich nor great, young nor handsome, in no respect what is called
fascinating, imposing, or brilliant, and yet he (<font color='blue'><b>Professor</b></font>) was as attractive as a
genial fire, and people seemed to gather about him (<font color='blue'><b>Professor</b></font>) as naturally as
about a warm hearth. He (<font color='blue'><b>Professor</b></font>) was poor, yet always appeared to be giving
something away; a stranger, yet everyone was his (<font color='blue'><b>stranger</b></font>) friend; no longer
young, but as happy-hearted as a boy; plain and peculiar, yet his (<font color='blue'><b>stranger</b></font>) face
looked beautiful to many, and his (<font color='blue'><b>stranger</b></font>) oddities were freely forgiven for his (<font color='blue'><b>stranger</b></font>)
sake. Jo often watched him (<font color='blue'><b>stranger</b></font>), trying to discover the charm, and at last
decided that it was benevolence which worked the miracle. If he (<font color='blue'><b>stranger</b></font>) had
any sorrow, `it sat with its head under its wing', and he (<font color='blue'><b>stranger</b></font>) turned only
his (<font color='blue'><b>stranger</b></font>) sunny side to the world. There were lines upon his (<font color='blue'><b>stranger</b></font>) forehead, but
Time seemed to have touched him (<font color='blue'><b>stranger</b></font>) gently, remembering how kind he (<font color='blue'><b>stranger</b></font>) was to
others. The pleasant curves about his (<font color='blue'><b>stranger</b></font>) mouth were the memorials of many
friendly words and cheery laughs, his (<font color='blue'><b>stranger</b></font>) eyes were never cold or hard, and
his (<font color='blue'><b>stranger</b></font>) big hand had a warm, strong grasp that was more expressive than
words.

<p/>His (<font color='blue'><b>stranger</b></font>) very clothes seemed to partake of the hospitable nature of the
wearer. They looked as if they were at ease, and liked to make him (<font color='blue'><b>stranger</b></font>)
comfortable. His (<font color='blue'><b>stranger</b></font>) capacious waistcoat was suggestive of a large heart
underneath. His (<font color='blue'><b>stranger</b></font>) rusty coat had a social air, and the baggy pockets
plainly proved that little hands often went in empty and came out full.
His (<font color='blue'><b>stranger</b></font>) very boots were benevolent, and his (<font color='blue'><b>stranger</b></font>) collars never stiff and raspy
like other people's.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``That's it!''  (<font color='red'><b>Jo/Miss Jo/JO</b></font>)</div>said Jo to herself, when she (<font color='blue'><b>Jo</b></font>) at length discovered that
genuine good will toward one's fellow men could beautify and dignify
even a stout German teacher, who shoveled in his (<font color='blue'><b>stranger</b></font>) dinner, darned his (<font color='blue'><b>stranger</b></font>) own
socks, and was burdened with the name of Bhaer.

<p/>Jo valued goodness highly, but she (<font color='blue'><b>Jo</b></font>) also possessed a most feminine
respect for intellect, and a little discovery which she (<font color='blue'><b>Jo</b></font>) made about the
Professor added much to her (<font color='blue'><b>Jo</b></font>) regard for him (<font color='blue'><b>Professor</b></font>). He (<font color='blue'><b>Professor</b></font>) never spoke of himself,
and no one ever knew that in his (<font color='blue'><b>Professor</b></font>) native city he (<font color='blue'><b>Professor</b></font>) had been a man much
honored and esteemed for learning and integrity, till a countryman came
to see him (<font color='blue'><b>countryman</b></font>). He (<font color='blue'><b>countryman</b></font>) never spoke of himself, and in a conversation with Miss
Norton divulged the pleasing fact. From her (<font color='blue'><b>Norton</b></font>) Jo learned it, and liked
it all the better because Mr. Bhaer had never told it. She (<font color='blue'><b>Jo</b></font>) felt proud
to know that he (<font color='blue'><b>Bhaer</b></font>) was an honored Professor in Berlin, though only a poor
language-master in America, and his (<font color='blue'><b>Bhaer</b></font>) homely, hard-working life was much
beautified by the spice of romance which this discovery gave it.
Another and a better gift than intellect was shown her (<font color='blue'><b>Jo</b></font>) in a most
unexpected manner. Miss Norton had the entree into most society, which
Jo would have had no chance of seeing but for her (<font color='blue'><b>Jo</b></font>). The solitary woman
felt an interest in the ambitious girl, and kindly conferred many
favors of this sort both on Jo and the Professor. She (<font color='blue'><b>Jo</b></font>) took them with
her (<font color='blue'><b>Jo</b></font>) one night to a select symposium, held in honor of several
celebrities.

<p/>Jo went prepared to bow down and adore the mighty ones whom she (<font color='blue'><b>Jo</b></font>) had
worshiped with youthful enthusiasm afar off. But her (<font color='blue'><b>Jo</b></font>) reverence for
genius received a severe shock that night, and it took her (<font color='blue'><b>Jo</b></font>) some time to
recover from the discovery that the great creatures were only men and
women after all. Imagine her (<font color='blue'><b>Jo</b></font>) dismay, on stealing a glance of timid
admiration at the poet whose lines suggested an ethereal being fed on
`spirit, fire, and dew', to behold him (<font color='blue'><b>poet</b></font>) devouring his (<font color='blue'><b>poet</b></font>) supper with an
ardor which flushed his (<font color='blue'><b>poet</b></font>) intellectual countenance. Turning as from a
fallen idol, she (<font color='blue'><b>Jo</b></font>) made other discoveries which rapidly dispelled her (<font color='blue'><b>Jo</b></font>)
romantic illusions. The great novelist vibrated between two decanters
with the regularity of a pendulum; the famous divine flirted openly
with one of the Madame de Staels of the age, who looked daggers at
another Corinne, who was amiably satirizing her (<font color='blue'><b>Corinne</b></font>), after outmaneuvering
her (<font color='blue'><b>Corinne</b></font>) in efforts to absorb the profound philosopher, who imbibed tea
Johnsonianly and appeared to slumber, the loquacity of the lady
rendering speech impossible. The scientific celebrities, forgetting
their mollusks and glacial periods, gossiped about art, while devoting
themselves to oysters and ices with characteristic energy; the young
musician, who was charming the city like a second Orpheus, talked
horses; and the specimen of the British nobility present happened to be
the most ordinary man of the party.

<p/>Before the evening was half over, Jo felt so completely disillusioned,
that she (<font color='blue'><b>Jo</b></font>) sat down in a corner to recover herself. Mr. Bhaer soon joined
her (<font color='blue'><b>Jo</b></font>), looking rather out of his (<font color='blue'><b>Bhaer</b></font>) element, and presently several of the
philosophers, each mounted on his (<font color='blue'><b>Bhaer</b></font>) hobby, came ambling up to hold an
intellectual tournament in the recess. The conversations were miles
beyond Jo's comprehension, but she (<font color='blue'><b>Jo</b></font>) enjoyed it, though Kant and Hegel
were unknown gods, the Subjective and Objective unintelligible terms,
and the only thing `evolved from her (<font color='blue'><b>Jo</b></font>) inner consciousness' was a bad
headache after it was all over. It dawned upon her (<font color='blue'><b>Jo</b></font>) gradually that the
world was being picked to pieces, and put together on new and,
according to the talkers, on infinitely better principles than before,
that religion was in a fair way to be reasoned into nothingness, and
intellect was to be the only God. Jo knew nothing about philosophy or
metaphysics of any sort, but a curious excitement, half pleasurable,
half painful, came over her (<font color='blue'><b>Jo</b></font>) as she (<font color='blue'><b>Jo</b></font>) listened with a sense of being
turned adrift into time and space, like a young balloon out on a
holiday.

<p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>Jo</b></font>) looked round to see how the Professor liked it, and found him (<font color='blue'><b>Professor</b></font>)
looking at her (<font color='blue'><b>Jo</b></font>) with the grimmest expression she (<font color='blue'><b>Jo</b></font>) had ever seen him (<font color='blue'><b>Professor</b></font>) wear.
He (<font color='blue'><b>Professor</b></font>) shook his (<font color='blue'><b>Professor</b></font>) head and beckoned her (<font color='blue'><b>Jo</b></font>) to come away, but she (<font color='blue'><b>Jo</b></font>) was fascinated
just then by the freedom of Speculative Philosophy, and kept her (<font color='blue'><b>Jo</b></font>) seat,
trying to find out what the wise gentlemen intended to rely upon after
they had annihilated all the old beliefs.

<p/>Now, Mr. Bhaer was a diffident man and slow to offer his (<font color='blue'><b>Bhaer</b></font>) own opinions,
not because they were unsettled, but too sincere and earnest to be
lightly spoken. As he (<font color='blue'><b>Bhaer</b></font>) glanced from Jo to several other young people,
attracted by the brilliancy of the philosophic pyrotechnics, he (<font color='blue'><b>Bhaer</b></font>) knit
his (<font color='blue'><b>Bhaer</b></font>) brows and longed to speak, fearing that some inflammable young soul
would be led astray by the rockets, to find when the display was over
that they had only an empty stick or a scorched hand.

<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Bhaer</b></font>) bore it as long as he (<font color='blue'><b>Bhaer</b></font>) could, but when he (<font color='blue'><b>Bhaer</b></font>) was appealed to for an
opinion, he (<font color='blue'><b>Bhaer</b></font>) blazed up with honest indignation and defended religion
with all the eloquence of truth--an eloquence which made his (<font color='blue'><b>Bhaer</b></font>) broken
English musical and his (<font color='blue'><b>Bhaer</b></font>) plain face beautiful. He (<font color='blue'><b>Bhaer</b></font>) had a hard fight, for
the wise men argued well, but he (<font color='blue'><b>Bhaer</b></font>) didn't know when he (<font color='blue'><b>Bhaer</b></font>) was beaten and
stood to his (<font color='blue'><b>Bhaer</b></font>) colors like a man. Somehow, as he (<font color='blue'><b>Bhaer</b></font>) talked, the world got
right again to Jo. The old beliefs, that had lasted so long, seemed
better than the new. God was not a blind force, and immortality was
not a pretty fable, but a blessed fact. She (<font color='blue'><b>Jo</b></font>) felt as if she (<font color='blue'><b>Jo</b></font>) had solid
ground under her (<font color='blue'><b>Jo</b></font>) feet again, and when Mr. Bhaer paused, outtalked but
not one whit convinced, Jo wanted to clap her (<font color='blue'><b>Jo</b></font>) hands and thank him (<font color='blue'><b>Bhaer</b></font>).

<p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>Jo</b></font>) did neither, but she (<font color='blue'><b>Jo</b></font>) remembered the scene, and gave the Professor
her (<font color='blue'><b>Jo</b></font>) heartiest respect, for she (<font color='blue'><b>Jo</b></font>) knew it cost him (<font color='blue'><b>Professor</b></font>) an effort to speak out
then and there, because his (<font color='blue'><b>Professor</b></font>) conscience would not let him (<font color='blue'><b>Professor</b></font>) be silent.
She (<font color='blue'><b>Jo</b></font>) began to see that character is a better possession than money,
rank, intellect, or beauty, and to feel that if greatness is what a
wise man has defined it to be, `truth, reverence, and good will', then
her (<font color='blue'><b>Jo</b></font>) friend Friedrich Bhaer was not only good, but great.

<p/>This belief strengthened daily. She (<font color='blue'><b>Jo</b></font>) valued his (<font color='blue'><b>Bhaer</b></font>) esteem, she (<font color='blue'><b>Jo</b></font>) coveted his (<font color='blue'><b>Bhaer</b></font>)
respect, she (<font color='blue'><b>Jo</b></font>) wanted to be worthy of his (<font color='blue'><b>Bhaer</b></font>) friendship, and just when the
wish was sincerest, she (<font color='blue'><b>Jo</b></font>) came near to losing everything. It all grew
out of a cocked hat, for one evening the Professor came in to give Jo
her (<font color='blue'><b>Jo</b></font>) lesson with a paper soldier cap on his (<font color='blue'><b>Professor</b></font>) head, which Tina had put
there and he (<font color='blue'><b>Professor</b></font>) had forgotten to take off.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``It's evident he (<font color='blue'><b>friend</b></font>) doesn't look in his (<font color='blue'><b>friend</b></font>) glass before coming down,''  (<font color='red'><b>Jo/Miss Jo/JO</b></font>)</div>thought
Jo, with a smile, as he (<font color='blue'><b>Professor</b></font>) said <div class="bookquote">``Goot efening,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>and sat soberly down,
quite unconscious of the ludicrous contrast between his (<font color='blue'><b>Professor</b></font>) subject and his (<font color='blue'><b>Professor</b></font>)
headgear, for he (<font color='blue'><b>Professor</b></font>) was going to read her (<font color='blue'><b>Jo</b></font>) the Death of Wallenstein.

<p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>Jo</b></font>) said nothing at first, for she (<font color='blue'><b>Jo</b></font>) liked to hear him (<font color='blue'><b>Professor</b></font>) laugh out his (<font color='blue'><b>Professor</b></font>) big,
hearty laugh when anything funny happened, so she (<font color='blue'><b>Jo</b></font>) left him (<font color='blue'><b>Professor</b></font>) to discover
it for himself, and presently forgot all about it, for to hear a German
read Schiller is rather an absorbing occupation. After the reading
came the lesson, which was a lively one, for Jo was in a gay mood that
night, and the cocked hat kept her (<font color='blue'><b>Jo</b></font>) eyes dancing with merriment. The
Professor didn't know what to make of her (<font color='blue'><b>Jo</b></font>), and stopped at last to ask
with an air of mild surprise that was irresistible...

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Mees Marsch, for what do you laugh in your master's face? Haf you no
respect for me, that you go on so bad?''

 (<font color='red'><b>her</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``How can I be respectful, Sir, when you forget to take your hat off?''
 (<font color='red'><b>Jo/Miss Jo/JO</b></font>)</div>said Jo.

<p/>Lifting his (<font color='blue'><b>Professor</b></font>) hand to his (<font color='blue'><b>Professor</b></font>) head, the absent-minded Professor gravely felt
and removed the little cocked hat, looked at it a minute, and then
threw back his (<font color='blue'><b>Professor</b></font>) head and laughed like a merry bass viol.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Ah! I see him (<font color='blue'><b>Marsch</b></font>) now, it is that imp Tina who makes me a fool with my
cap. Well, it is nothing, but see you, if this lesson goes not well,
you too shall wear him (<font color='blue'><b>fool</b></font>).''

 (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Bhaer</b></font>)</div><p/>But the lesson did not go at all for a few minutes because Mr. Bhaer
caught sight of a picture on the hat, and unfolding it, said with great
disgust, <div class="bookquote">``I wish these papers did not come in the house. They are not
for children to see, nor young people to read. It is not well, and I
haf no patience with those who make this harm.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Bhaer</b></font>)</div><p/>Jo glanced at the sheet and saw a pleasing illustration composed of a
lunatic, a corpse, a villain, and a viper. She (<font color='blue'><b>Jo</b></font>) did not like it, but
the impulse that made her (<font color='blue'><b>Jo</b></font>) turn it over was not one of displeasure but
fear, because for a minute she (<font color='blue'><b>Jo</b></font>) fancied the paper was the Volcano. It
was not, however, and her (<font color='blue'><b>Jo</b></font>) panic subsided as she (<font color='blue'><b>Jo</b></font>) remembered that even if
it had been and one of her (<font color='blue'><b>Jo</b></font>) own tales in it, there would have been no
name to betray her (<font color='blue'><b>Jo</b></font>). She (<font color='blue'><b>Jo</b></font>) had betrayed herself, however, by a look and a
blush, for though an absent man, the Professor saw a good deal more
than people fancied. He (<font color='blue'><b>Professor</b></font>) knew that Jo wrote, and had met her (<font color='blue'><b>Jo</b></font>) down among
the newspaper offices more than once, but as she (<font color='blue'><b>Jo</b></font>) never spoke of it, he (<font color='blue'><b>Professor</b></font>)
asked no questions in spite of a strong desire to see her (<font color='blue'><b>Jo</b></font>) work. Now it
occurred to him (<font color='blue'><b>Professor</b></font>) that she (<font color='blue'><b>Jo</b></font>) was doing what she (<font color='blue'><b>Jo</b></font>) was ashamed to own, and it
troubled him (<font color='blue'><b>Professor</b></font>). He (<font color='blue'><b>Professor</b></font>) did not say to himself, <div class="bookquote">``It is none of my business.
I've no right to say anything,''  (<font color='red'><b>He</b></font>)</div>as many people would have done. He (<font color='blue'><b>Professor</b></font>)
only remembered that she (<font color='blue'><b>Jo</b></font>) was young and poor, a girl far away from
mother's love and father's care, and he (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) was moved to help her (<font color='blue'><b>Jo</b></font>) with an
impulse as quick and natural as that which would prompt him (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) to put out
his (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) hand to save a baby from a puddle. All this flashed through his (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>)
mind in a minute, but not a trace of it appeared in his (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) face, and by
the time the paper was turned, and Jo's needle threaded, he (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) was ready
to say quite naturally, but very gravely...

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Yes, you are right to put it from you. I do not think that good young
girls should see such things. They are made pleasant to some, but I
would more rather give my boys gunpowder to play with than this bad
trash.''

 (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``All may not be bad, only silly, you know, and if there is a demand for
it, I don't see any harm in supplying it. Many very respectable people
make an honest living out of what are called sensation stories,''  (<font color='red'><b>Jo/Miss Jo/JO</b></font>)</div>said
Jo, scratching gathers so energetically that a row of little slits
followed her (<font color='blue'><b>Jo</b></font>) pin.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``There is a demand for whisky, but I think you and I do not care to
sell it. If the respectable people knew what harm they did, they would
not feel that the living was honest. They haf no right to put poison
in the sugarplum, and let the small ones eat it. No, they should think
a little, and sweep mud in the street before they do this thing.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Bhaer</b></font>)</div><p/>Mr. Bhaer spoke warmly, and walked to the fire, crumpling the paper in
his (<font color='blue'><b>Bhaer</b></font>) hands. Jo sat still, looking as if the fire had come to her (<font color='blue'><b>Jo</b></font>), for
her (<font color='blue'><b>Jo</b></font>) cheeks burned long after the cocked hat had turned to smoke and
gone harmlessly up the chimney.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``I should like much to send all the rest after him (<font color='blue'><b>they</b></font>),''  (<font color='red'><b>the Professor</b></font>)</div>muttered the
Professor, coming back with a relieved air.

<p/>Jo thought what a blaze her (<font color='blue'><b>Jo</b></font>) pile of papers upstairs would make, and her (<font color='blue'><b>Jo</b></font>)
hard-earned money lay rather heavily on her (<font color='blue'><b>Jo</b></font>) conscience at that minute.
Then she (<font color='blue'><b>Jo</b></font>) thought consolingly to herself, <div class="bookquote">``Mine are not like that, they
are only silly, never bad, so I won't be worried,''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>and taking up her (<font color='blue'><b>Jo</b></font>)
book, she (<font color='blue'><b>Jo</b></font>) said, with a studious face, <div class="bookquote">``Shall we go on, Sir? I'll be
very good and proper now.''

 (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I shall hope so,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>was all he (<font color='blue'><b>Professor</b></font>) said, but he (<font color='blue'><b>Professor</b></font>) meant more than she (<font color='blue'><b>Jo</b></font>)
imagined, and the grave, kind look he (<font color='blue'><b>Professor</b></font>) gave her (<font color='blue'><b>Jo</b></font>) made her (<font color='blue'><b>Jo</b></font>) feel as if the
words Weekly Volcano were printed in large type on her (<font color='blue'><b>Jo</b></font>) forehead.

<p/>As soon as she (<font color='blue'><b>Jo</b></font>) went to her (<font color='blue'><b>Jo</b></font>) room, she (<font color='blue'><b>Jo</b></font>) got out her (<font color='blue'><b>Jo</b></font>) papers, and carefully
reread every one of her (<font color='blue'><b>Jo</b></font>) stories. Being a little shortsighted, Mr.
Bhaer sometimes used eye glasses, and Jo had tried them once, smiling
to see how they magnified the fine print of her (<font color='blue'><b>Jo</b></font>) book. Now she (<font color='blue'><b>Jo</b></font>) seemed
to have on the Professor's mental or moral spectacles also, for the
faults of these poor stories glared at her (<font color='blue'><b>Jo</b></font>) dreadfully and filled her (<font color='blue'><b>Jo</b></font>)
with dismay.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``They are trash, and will soon be worse trash if I go on, for each is
more sensational than the last. I've gone blindly on, hurting myself
and other people, for the sake of money. I know it's so, for I can't
read this stuff in sober earnest without being horribly ashamed of it,
and what should I do if they were seen at home or Mr. Bhaer got hold of
them?''

 (<font color='red'><b>Jo/Miss Jo/JO</b></font>)</div><p/>Jo turned hot at the bare idea, and stuffed the whole bundle into her (<font color='blue'><b>Jo</b></font>)
stove, nearly setting the chimney afire with the blaze.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Yes, that's the best place for such inflammable nonsense. I'd better
burn the house down, I suppose, than let other people blow themselves
up with my gunpowder,''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Jo</b></font>) thought as she (<font color='blue'><b>Jo</b></font>) watched the Demon of the Jura
whisk away, a little black cinder with fiery eyes.

<p/>But when nothing remained of all her (<font color='blue'><b>Jo</b></font>) three month's work except a heap
of ashes and the money in her (<font color='blue'><b>Jo</b></font>) lap, Jo looked sober, as she (<font color='blue'><b>Jo</b></font>) sat on the
floor, wondering what she (<font color='blue'><b>Jo</b></font>) ought to do about her (<font color='blue'><b>Jo</b></font>) wages.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``I think I haven't done much harm yet, and may keep this to pay for my
time,''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Jo</b></font>) said, after a long meditation, adding impatiently, <div class="bookquote">``I almost
wish I hadn't any conscience, it's so inconvenient. If I didn't care
about doing right, and didn't feel uncomfortable when doing wrong, I
should get on capitally. I can't help wishing sometimes, that Mother
and Father hadn't been so particular about such things.''

 (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div><p/>Ah, Jo, instead of wishing that, thank God that ``Father and Mother were
particular', and pity from your heart those who have no such guardians
to hedge them round with principles which may seem like prison walls to
impatient youth, but which will prove sure foundations to build
character upon in womanhood.

<p/>Jo wrote no more sensational stories, deciding that the money did not
pay for her (<font color='blue'><b>Jo</b></font>) share of the sensation, but going to the other extreme, as
is the way with people of her (<font color='blue'><b>Jo</b></font>) stamp, she (<font color='blue'><b>Jo</b></font>) took a course of Mrs.
Sherwood, Miss Edgeworth, and Hannah More, and then produced a tale
which might have been more properly called an essay or a sermon, so
intensely moral was it. She (<font color='blue'><b>Hannah</b></font>) had her (<font color='blue'><b>Hannah</b></font>) doubts about it from the
beginning, for her (<font color='blue'><b>Hannah</b></font>) lively fancy and girlish romance felt as ill at ease
in the new style as she (<font color='blue'><b>Hannah</b></font>) would have done masquerading in the stiff and
cumbrous costume of the last century. She (<font color='blue'><b>Hannah</b></font>) sent this didactic gem to
several markets, but it found no purchaser, and she (<font color='blue'><b>Hannah</b></font>) was inclined to
agree with Mr. Dashwood that morals didn't sell.

<p/>Then she (<font color='blue'><b>Hannah</b></font>) tried a child's story, which she (<font color='blue'><b>Hannah</b></font>) could easily have disposed of
if she (<font color='blue'><b>Hannah</b></font>) had not been mercenary enough to demand filthy lucre for it.
The only person who offered enough to make it worth her (<font color='blue'><b>Hannah</b></font>) while to try
juvenile literature was a worthy gentleman who felt it his (<font color='blue'><b>gentleman</b></font>) mission to
convert all the world to his (<font color='blue'><b>gentleman</b></font>) particular belief. But much as she (<font color='blue'><b>Hannah</b></font>) liked
to write for children, Jo could not consent to depict all her (<font color='blue'><b>Jo</b></font>) naughty
boys as being eaten by bears or tossed by mad bulls because they did
not go to a particular Sabbath school, nor all the good infants who did
go as rewarded by every kind of bliss, from gilded gingerbread to
escorts of angels when they departed this life with psalms or sermons
on their lisping tongues. So nothing came of these trials, and Jo
corked up her (<font color='blue'><b>Jo</b></font>) inkstand, and said in a fit of very wholesome humility...

<p/><div class="bookquote">``I don't know anything. I'll wait until I do before I try again, and
meantime, `sweep mud in the street' if I can't do better, that's
honest, at least.''  (<font color='red'><b>Jo/Miss Jo/JO</b></font>)</div>Which decision proved that her (<font color='blue'><b>Jo</b></font>) second tumble down
the beanstalk had done her (<font color='blue'><b>Jo</b></font>) some good.

<p/>While these internal revolutions were going on, her (<font color='blue'><b>Jo</b></font>) external life had
been as busy and uneventful as usual, and if she (<font color='blue'><b>Jo</b></font>) sometimes looked
serious or a little sad no one observed it but Professor Bhaer. He (<font color='blue'><b>Professor</b></font>) did
it so quietly that Jo never knew he (<font color='blue'><b>Professor</b></font>) was watching to see if she (<font color='blue'><b>Jo</b></font>) would
accept and profit by his (<font color='blue'><b>Professor</b></font>) reproof, but she (<font color='blue'><b>Jo</b></font>) stood the test, and he (<font color='blue'><b>Professor</b></font>) was
satisfied, for though no words passed between them, he (<font color='blue'><b>Professor</b></font>) knew that she (<font color='blue'><b>Jo</b></font>)
had given up writing. Not only did he (<font color='blue'><b>Professor</b></font>) guess it by the fact that the
second finger of her (<font color='blue'><b>Jo</b></font>) right hand was no longer inky, but she (<font color='blue'><b>Jo</b></font>) spent her (<font color='blue'><b>Jo</b></font>)
evenings downstairs now, was met no more among newspaper offices, and
studied with a dogged patience, which assured him (<font color='blue'><b>Professor</b></font>) that she (<font color='blue'><b>Jo</b></font>) was bent on
occupying her (<font color='blue'><b>Jo</b></font>) mind with something useful, if not pleasant.

<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Professor</b></font>) helped her (<font color='blue'><b>Jo</b></font>) in many ways, proving himself a true friend, and Jo was
happy, for while her (<font color='blue'><b>Jo</b></font>) pen lay idle, she (<font color='blue'><b>Jo</b></font>) was learning other lessons
besides German, and laying a foundation for the sensation story of her (<font color='blue'><b>Jo</b></font>)
own life.

<p/>It was a pleasant winter and a long one, for she (<font color='blue'><b>Jo</b></font>) did not leave Mrs.
Kirke till June. Everyone seemed sorry when the time came. The
children were inconsolable, and Mr. Bhaer's hair stuck straight up all
over his (<font color='blue'><b>Bhaer</b></font>) head, for he (<font color='blue'><b>Bhaer</b></font>) always rumpled it wildly when disturbed in mind.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Going home? Ah, you are happy that you haf a home to go in,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Bhaer</b></font>) said,
when she (<font color='blue'><b>Jo</b></font>) told him (<font color='blue'><b>Bhaer</b></font>), and sat silently pulling his (<font color='blue'><b>Bhaer</b></font>) beard in the corner,
while she (<font color='blue'><b>Jo</b></font>) held a little levee on that last evening.

<p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>Jo</b></font>) was going early, so she (<font color='blue'><b>Jo</b></font>) bade them all goodbye overnight, and when
his (<font color='blue'><b>Bhaer</b></font>) turn came, she (<font color='blue'><b>Jo</b></font>) said warmly, <div class="bookquote">``Now, Sir, you won't forget to come and
see us, if you ever travel our way, will you? I'll never forgive you if
you do, for I want them all to know my friend.''

 (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Do you? Shall I come?''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Bhaer</b></font>) asked, looking down at her (<font color='blue'><b>Jo</b></font>) with an eager
expression which she (<font color='blue'><b>Jo</b></font>) did not see.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Yes, come next month. Laurie graduates then, and you'd enjoy
commencement as something new.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``That is your best friend, of whom you speak?''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Bhaer</b></font>) said in an altered
tone.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Yes, my boy Teddy. I'm very proud of him (<font color='blue'><b>Teddy</b></font>) and should like you to see
him (<font color='blue'><b>Teddy</b></font>).''

 (<font color='red'><b>Jo/Miss Jo/JO</b></font>)</div><p/>Jo looked up then, quite unconscious of anything but her (<font color='blue'><b>Jo</b></font>) own pleasure
in the prospect of showing them to one another. Something in Mr.
Bhaer's face suddenly recalled the fact that she (<font color='blue'><b>Jo</b></font>) might find Laurie more
than a `best friend', and simply because she (<font color='blue'><b>Jo</b></font>) particularly wished not to
look as if anything was the matter, she (<font color='blue'><b>Jo</b></font>) involuntarily began to blush,
and the more she (<font color='blue'><b>Jo</b></font>) tried not to, the redder she (<font color='blue'><b>Jo</b></font>) grew. If it had not been
for Tina on her (<font color='blue'><b>Tina</b></font>) knee. She (<font color='blue'><b>Tina</b></font>) didn't know what would have become of her (<font color='blue'><b>Tina</b></font>).
Fortunately the child was moved to hug her (<font color='blue'><b>Tina</b></font>), so she (<font color='blue'><b>Tina</b></font>) managed to hide her (<font color='blue'><b>Tina</b></font>)
face an instant, hoping the Professor did not see it. But he (<font color='blue'><b>Professor</b></font>) did, and
his (<font color='blue'><b>Professor</b></font>) own changed again from that momentary anxiety to its usual
expression, as he (<font color='blue'><b>Professor</b></font>) said cordially...

<p/><div class="bookquote">``I fear I shall not make the time for that, but I wish the friend much
success, and you all happiness. Gott bless you!''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>And with that, he (<font color='blue'><b>Professor</b></font>)
shook hands warmly, shouldered Tina, and went away.

<p/>But after the boys were abed, he (<font color='blue'><b>Professor</b></font>) sat long before his (<font color='blue'><b>Professor</b></font>) fire with the
tired look on his (<font color='blue'><b>Professor</b></font>) face and the `heimweh', or homesickness, lying heavy
at his (<font color='blue'><b>Professor</b></font>) heart. Once, when he (<font color='blue'><b>Professor</b></font>) remembered Jo as she (<font color='blue'><b>Jo</b></font>) sat with the little
child in her (<font color='blue'><b>Jo</b></font>) lap and that new softness in her (<font color='blue'><b>Jo</b></font>) face, he (<font color='blue'><b>Professor</b></font>) leaned his (<font color='blue'><b>Professor</b></font>) head
on his (<font color='blue'><b>Professor</b></font>) hands a minute, and then roamed about the room, as if in search
of something that he (<font color='blue'><b>Professor</b></font>) could not find.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``It is not for me, I must not hope it now,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Professor</b></font>) said to himself, with a
sigh that was almost a groan. Then, as if reproaching himself for the
longing that he (<font color='blue'><b>Professor</b></font>) could not repress, he (<font color='blue'><b>Professor</b></font>) went and kissed the two tousled
heads upon the pillow, took down his (<font color='blue'><b>Professor</b></font>) seldom-used meerschaum, and opened
his (<font color='blue'><b>Professor</b></font>) Plato.

<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Professor</b></font>) did his (<font color='blue'><b>Professor</b></font>) best and did it manfully, but I don't think he (<font color='blue'><b>Professor</b></font>) found that a
pair of rampant boys, a pipe, or even the divine Plato, were very
satisfactory substitutes for wife and child at home.

<p/>Early as it was, he (<font color='blue'><b>Plato</b></font>) was at the station next morning to see Jo off, and
thanks to him (<font color='blue'><b>Plato</b></font>), she (<font color='blue'><b>Jo</b></font>) began her (<font color='blue'><b>Jo</b></font>) solitary journey with the pleasant memory
of a familiar face smiling its farewell, a bunch of violets to keep her (<font color='blue'><b>Jo</b></font>)
company, and best of all, the happy thought, <div class="bookquote">``Well, the winter's gone,
and I've written no books, earned no fortune, but I've made a friend
worth having and I'll try to keep him (<font color='blue'><b>friend</b></font>) all my life.''



 (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div><p/>CHAPTER THIRTY-FIVE

<p/>HEARTACHE

<p/>Whatever his (<font color='blue'><b>Plato</b></font>) motive might have been, Laurie studied to some purpose
that year, for he (<font color='blue'><b>Laurie</b></font>) graduated with honor, and gave the Latin oration with
the grace of a Phillips and the eloquence of a Demosthenes, so his (<font color='blue'><b>Phillips</b></font>)
friends said. They were all there, his (<font color='blue'><b>Phillips</b></font>) grandfather--oh, so proud--Mr.
and Mrs. March, John and Meg, Jo and Beth, and all exulted over him (<font color='blue'><b>Phillips</b></font>)
with the sincere admiration which boys make light of at the time, but
fail to win from the world by any after-triumphs.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``I've got to stay for this confounded supper, but I shall be home early
tomorrow. You'll come and meet me as usual, girls?''  (<font color='red'><b>Laurie/Mr. Laurie/LAURIE</b></font>)</div>Laurie said, as he (<font color='blue'><b>Laurie</b></font>)
put the sisters into the carriage after the joys of the day were over.
He (<font color='blue'><b>Laurie</b></font>) said `girls', but he (<font color='blue'><b>Laurie</b></font>) meant Jo, for she (<font color='blue'><b>Jo</b></font>) was the only one who kept up
the old custom. She (<font color='blue'><b>Jo</b></font>) had not the heart to refuse her (<font color='blue'><b>Jo</b></font>) splendid,
successful boy anything, and answered warmly...

<p/>``I'll come, Teddy, rain or shine, and march before you, playing <div class="bookquote">``Hail
the conquering hero comes' on a jew's-harp.''

 (<font color='red'><b>boy</b></font>)</div><p/>Laurie thanked her (<font color='blue'><b>Jo</b></font>) with a look that made her (<font color='blue'><b>Jo</b></font>) think in a sudden panic,
<div class="bookquote">``Oh, deary me! I know he (<font color='blue'><b>jew</b></font>)'ll say something, and then what shall I do?''

 (<font color='red'><b>her</b></font>)</div><p/>Evening meditation and morning work somewhat allayed her (<font color='blue'><b>Jo</b></font>) fears, and
having decided that she (<font color='blue'><b>Jo</b></font>) wouldn't be vain enough to think people were
going to propose when she (<font color='blue'><b>Jo</b></font>) had given them every reason to know what her (<font color='blue'><b>Jo</b></font>)
answer would be, she (<font color='blue'><b>Jo</b></font>) set forth at the appointed time, hoping Teddy
wouldn't do anything to make her (<font color='blue'><b>Jo</b></font>) hurt his (<font color='blue'><b>Teddy</b></font>) poor feelings. A call at
Meg's, and a refreshing sniff and sip at the Daisy and Demijohn, still
further fortified her (<font color='blue'><b>Daisy</b></font>) for the tete-a-tete, but when she (<font color='blue'><b>Daisy</b></font>) saw a stalwart
figure looming in the distance, she (<font color='blue'><b>Daisy</b></font>) had a strong desire to turn about
and run away.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Where's the jew's-harp, Jo?''  (<font color='red'><b>Laurie/Mr. Laurie/LAURIE</b></font>)</div>cried Laurie, as soon as he (<font color='blue'><b>Laurie</b></font>) was within
speaking distance.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``I forgot it.''  (<font color='red'><b>Jo/Miss Jo/JO</b></font>)</div>And Jo took heart again, for that salutation could not
be called lover-like.

<p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>Jo</b></font>) always used to take his (<font color='blue'><b>Laurie</b></font>) arm on these occasions, now she (<font color='blue'><b>Jo</b></font>) did not,
and he (<font color='blue'><b>Laurie</b></font>) made no complaint, which was a bad sign, but talked on rapidly
about all sorts of faraway subjects, till they turned from the road
into the little path that led homeward through the grove. Then he (<font color='blue'><b>Laurie</b></font>)
walked more slowly, suddenly lost his (<font color='blue'><b>Laurie</b></font>) fine flow of language, and now
and then a dreadful pause occurred. To rescue the conversation from
one of the wells of silence into which it kept falling, Jo said
hastily, <div class="bookquote">``Now you must have a good long holiday!''

 (<font color='red'><b>Jo/Miss Jo/JO</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I intend to.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Jo/Miss Jo/JO</b></font>)</div><p/>Something in his (<font color='blue'><b>Laurie</b></font>) resolute tone made Jo look up quickly to find him (<font color='blue'><b>Laurie</b></font>)
looking down at her (<font color='blue'><b>Jo</b></font>) with an expression that assured her (<font color='blue'><b>Jo</b></font>) the dreaded
moment had come, and made her (<font color='blue'><b>Jo</b></font>) put out her (<font color='blue'><b>Jo</b></font>) hand with an imploring, <div class="bookquote">``No,
Teddy. Please don't!''

 (<font color='red'><b>her</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I will, and you must hear me. It's no use, Jo, we've got to have it
out, and the sooner the better for both of us,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Laurie</b></font>) answered, getting
flushed and excited all at once.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Say what you like then. I'll listen,''  (<font color='red'><b>Jo/Miss Jo/JO</b></font>)</div>said Jo, with a desperate sort
of patience.

<p/>Laurie was a young lover, but he (<font color='blue'><b>Laurie</b></font>) was in earnest, and meant to `have it
out', if he (<font color='blue'><b>Laurie</b></font>) died in the attempt, so he (<font color='blue'><b>Laurie</b></font>) plunged into the subject with
characteristic impetuousity, saying in a voice that would get choky now
and then, in spite of manful efforts to keep it steady...

<p/><div class="bookquote">``I've loved you ever since I've known you, Jo, couldn't help it, you've
been so good to me. I've tried to show it, but you wouldn't let me.
Now I'm going to make you hear, and give me an answer, for I can't go
on so any longer.''

 (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I wanted to save you this. I thought you'd understand...''  (<font color='red'><b>Jo/Miss Jo/JO</b></font>)</div>began Jo,
finding it a great deal harder than she (<font color='blue'><b>Jo</b></font>) expected.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``I know you did, but the girls are so queer you never know what they
mean. They say no when they mean yes, and drive a man out of his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) wits
just for the fun of it,''  (<font color='red'><b>Laurie/Mr. Laurie/LAURIE</b></font>)</div>returned Laurie, entrenching himself behind an
undeniable fact.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``I don't. I never wanted to make you care for me so, and I went away
to keep you from it if I could.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I thought so. It was like you, but it was no use. I only loved you
all the more, and I worked hard to please you, and I gave up billiards
and everything you didn't like, and waited and never complained, for I
hoped you'd love me, though I'm not half good enough...''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>Here there was
a choke that couldn't be controlled, so he (<font color='blue'><b>Laurie</b></font>) decapitated buttercups while
he (<font color='blue'><b>Laurie</b></font>) cleared his (<font color='blue'><b>Laurie</b></font>) `confounded throat'.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``You, you are, you're a great deal too good for me, and I'm so grateful
to you, and so proud and fond of you, I don't know why I can't love you
as you want me to. I've tried, but I can't change the feeling, and it
would be a lie to say I do when I don't.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Really, truly, Jo?''

 (<font color='red'><b>He</b></font>)</div><p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Laurie</b></font>) stopped short, and caught both her (<font color='blue'><b>Jo</b></font>) hands as he (<font color='blue'><b>Laurie</b></font>) put his (<font color='blue'><b>Laurie</b></font>) question with
a look that she (<font color='blue'><b>Jo</b></font>) did not soon forget.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Really, truly, dear.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Jo/Miss Jo/JO</b></font>)</div><p/>They were in the grove now, close by the stile, and when the last words
fell reluctantly from Jo's lips, Laurie dropped her (<font color='blue'><b>Jo</b></font>) hands and turned as
if to go on, but for once in his (<font color='blue'><b>Laurie</b></font>) life the fence was too much for him (<font color='blue'><b>Laurie</b></font>).
So he (<font color='blue'><b>Laurie</b></font>) just laid his (<font color='blue'><b>Laurie</b></font>) head down on the mossy post, and stood so still
that Jo was frightened.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Oh, Teddy, I'm sorry, so desperately sorry, I could kill myself if it
would do any good! I wish you wouldn't take it so hard, I can't help
it. You know it's impossible for people to make themselves love other
people if they don't,''  (<font color='red'><b>Jo/Miss Jo/JO</b></font>)</div>cried Jo inelegantly but remorsefully, as she (<font color='blue'><b>Jo</b></font>)
softly patted his (<font color='blue'><b>Laurie</b></font>) shoulder, remembering the time when he (<font color='blue'><b>Laurie</b></font>) had comforted
her (<font color='blue'><b>Jo</b></font>) so long ago.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``They do sometimes,''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>said a muffled voice from the post. <div class="bookquote">``I don't
believe it's the right sort of love, and I'd rather not try it,''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>was
the decided answer.

<p/>There was a long pause, while a blackbird sung blithely on the willow
by the river, and the tall grass rustled in the wind. Presently Jo said
very soberly, as she (<font color='blue'><b>Jo</b></font>) sat down on the step of the stile, <div class="bookquote">``Laurie, I want
to tell you something.''

 (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div><p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Laurie</b></font>) started as if he (<font color='blue'><b>Laurie</b></font>) had been shot, threw up his (<font color='blue'><b>Laurie</b></font>) head, and cried out in
a fierce tone, <div class="bookquote">``Don't tell me that, Jo, I can't bear it now!''

 (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Tell what?''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Jo</b></font>) asked, wondering at his (<font color='blue'><b>Laurie</b></font>) violence.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``That you love that old man.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``What old man?''  (<font color='red'><b>Jo/Miss Jo/JO</b></font>)</div>demanded Jo, thinking he (<font color='blue'><b>Laurie</b></font>) must mean his (<font color='blue'><b>Laurie</b></font>) grandfather.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``That devilish Professor you were always writing about. If you say you
love him (<font color='blue'><b>Professor</b></font>), I know I shall do something desperate;''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>and he (<font color='blue'><b>Laurie</b></font>) looked as if
he (<font color='blue'><b>Laurie</b></font>) would keep his (<font color='blue'><b>Laurie</b></font>) word, as he (<font color='blue'><b>Laurie</b></font>) clenched his (<font color='blue'><b>Laurie</b></font>) hands with a wrathful spark
in his (<font color='blue'><b>Laurie</b></font>) eyes.

<p/>Jo wanted to laugh, but restrained herself and said warmly, for she (<font color='blue'><b>Jo</b></font>)
too, was getting excited with all this, <div class="bookquote">``Don't swear, Teddy! He (<font color='blue'><b>Teddy</b></font>) isn't
old, nor anything bad, but good and kind, and the best friend I've got,
next to you. Pray, don't fly into a passion. I want to be kind, but I
know I shall get angry if you abuse my Professor. I haven't the least
idea of loving him (<font color='blue'><b>Professor</b></font>) or anybody else.''

 (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``But you will after a while, and then what will become of me?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``You'll love someone else too, like a sensible boy, and forget all this
trouble.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I can't love anyone else, and I'll never forget you, Jo, Never!
Never!''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>with a stamp to emphasize his (<font color='blue'><b>Laurie</b></font>) passionate words.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``What shall I do with him (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>)?''  (<font color='red'><b>Jo/Miss Jo/JO</b></font>)</div>sighed Jo, finding that emotions were more
unmanagable than she (<font color='blue'><b>Jo</b></font>) expected. <div class="bookquote">``You haven't heard what I wanted to
tell you. Sit down and listen, for indeed I want to do right and make
you happy,''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Jo</b></font>) said, hoping to soothe him (<font color='blue'><b>Laurie</b></font>) with a little reason, which
proved that she (<font color='blue'><b>Jo</b></font>) knew nothing about love.

<p/>Seeing a ray of hope in that last speech, Laurie threw himself down on
the grass at her (<font color='blue'><b>Jo</b></font>) feet, leaned his (<font color='blue'><b>Laurie</b></font>) arm on the lower step of the stile,
and looked up at her (<font color='blue'><b>Jo</b></font>) with an expectant face. Now that arrangement was
not conducive to calm speech or clear thought on Jo's part, for how
could she (<font color='blue'><b>Jo</b></font>) say hard things to her (<font color='blue'><b>Jo</b></font>) boy while he (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>) watched her (<font color='blue'><b>Jo</b></font>) with eyes
full of love and longing, and lashes still wet with the bitter drop or
two her (<font color='blue'><b>Jo</b></font>) hardness of heart had wrung from him (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>)? She (<font color='blue'><b>Jo</b></font>) gently turned his (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>)
head away, saying, as she (<font color='blue'><b>Jo</b></font>) stroked the wavy hair which had been allowed
to grow for her (<font color='blue'><b>Jo</b></font>) sake--how touching that was, to be sure! <div class="bookquote">``I agree with
Mother that you and I are not suited to each other, because our quick
tempers and strong wills would probably make us very miserable, if we
were so foolish as to...''  (<font color='red'><b>Jo/Miss Jo/JO</b></font>)</div>Jo paused a little over the last word, but
Laurie uttered it with a rapturous expression.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Marry--no we shouldn't! If you loved me, Jo, I should be a perfect
saint, for you could make me anything you like.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``No, I can't. I've tried and failed, and I won't risk our happiness by
such a serious experiment. We don't agree and we never shall, so we'll
be good friends all our lives, but we won't go and do anything rash.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Yes, we will if we get the chance,''  (<font color='red'><b>Laurie/Mr. Laurie/LAURIE</b></font>)</div>muttered Laurie rebelliously.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Now do be reasonable, and take a sensible view of the case,''  (<font color='red'><b>Jo/Miss Jo/JO</b></font>)</div>implored
Jo, almost at her (<font color='blue'><b>Jo</b></font>) wit's end.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``I won't be reasonable. I don't want to take what you call 'a sensible
view'. It won't help me, and it only makes it harder. I don't believe
you've got any heart.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I wish I hadn't.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Jo/Miss Jo/JO</b></font>)</div><p/>There was a little quiver in Jo's voice, and thinking it a good omen,
Laurie turned round, bringing all his (<font color='blue'><b>Laurie</b></font>) persuasive powers to bear as he (<font color='blue'><b>Laurie</b></font>)
said, in the wheedlesome tone that had never been so dangerously
wheedlesome before, <div class="bookquote">``Don't disappoint us, dear! Everyone expects it.
Grandpa has set his (<font color='blue'><b>Grandpa</b></font>) heart upon it, your people like it, and I can't get
on without you. Say you will, and let's be happy. Do, do!''

 (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div><p/>Not until months afterward did Jo understand how she (<font color='blue'><b>Jo</b></font>) had the strength
of mind to hold fast to the resolution she (<font color='blue'><b>Jo</b></font>) had made when she (<font color='blue'><b>Jo</b></font>) decided
that she (<font color='blue'><b>Jo</b></font>) did not love her (<font color='blue'><b>Jo</b></font>) boy, and never could. It was very hard to
do, but she (<font color='blue'><b>Jo</b></font>) did it, knowing that delay was both useless and cruel.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``I can't say `yes' truly, so I won't say it at all. You'll see that
I'm right, by-and-by, and thank me for it...''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Jo</b></font>) began solemnly.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``I'll be hanged if I do!''  (<font color='red'><b>Laurie/Mr. Laurie/LAURIE</b></font>)</div>and Laurie bounced up off the grass, burning
with indignation at the very idea.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Yes, you will!''  (<font color='red'><b>Jo/Miss Jo/JO</b></font>)</div>persisted Jo. <div class="bookquote">``You'll get over this after a while,
and find some lovely accomplished girl, who will adore you, and make a
fine mistress for your fine house. I shouldn't. I'm homely and awkward
and odd and old, and you'd be ashamed of me, and we should quarrel--we
can't help it even now, you see--and I shouldn't like elegant society
and you would, and you'd hate my scribbling, and I couldn't get on
without it, and we should be unhappy, and wish we hadn't done it, and
everything would be horrid!''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Anything more?''  (<font color='red'><b>Laurie/Mr. Laurie/LAURIE</b></font>)</div>asked Laurie, finding it hard to listen patiently to
this prophetic burst.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Nothing more, except that I don't believe I shall ever marry. I'm
happy as I am, and love my liberty too well to be in a hurry to give it
up for any mortal man.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I know better!''  (<font color='red'><b>Laurie/Mr. Laurie/LAURIE</b></font>)</div>broke in Laurie. <div class="bookquote">``You think so now, but there'll come
a time when you will care for somebody, and you'll love him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>)
tremendously, and live and die for him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>). I know you will, it's your
way, and I shall have to stand by and see it,''  (<font color='red'><b>the lover</b></font>)</div>and the despairing lover
cast his (<font color='blue'><b>Laurie</b></font>) hat upon the ground with a gesture that would have seemed
comical, if his (<font color='blue'><b>Laurie</b></font>) face had not been so tragic.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Yes, I will live and die for him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>), if he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) ever comes and makes me love
him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) in spite of myself, and you must do the best you can!''  (<font color='red'><b>Jo/Miss Jo/JO</b></font>)</div>cried Jo,
losing patience with poor Teddy. <div class="bookquote">``I've done my best, but you won't be
reasonable, and it's selfish of you to keep teasing for what I can't
give. I shall always be fond of you, very fond indeed, as a friend,
but I'll never marry you, and the sooner you believe it the better for
both of us--so now!''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/>That speech was like gunpowder. Laurie looked at her (<font color='blue'><b>Jo</b></font>) a minute as if he (<font color='blue'><b>Laurie</b></font>)
did not quite know what to do with himself, then turned sharply away,
saying in a desperate sort of tone, <div class="bookquote">``You'll be sorry some day, Jo.''

 (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Oh, where are you going?''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Jo</b></font>) cried, for his (<font color='blue'><b>Laurie</b></font>) face frightened her (<font color='blue'><b>Jo</b></font>).

<p/><div class="bookquote">``To the devil!''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>was the consoling answer.

<p/>For a minute Jo's heart stood still, as he (<font color='blue'><b>Laurie</b></font>) swung himself down the bank
toward the river, but it takes much folly, sin or misery to send a
young man to a violent death, and Laurie was not one of the weak sort
who are conquered by a single failure. He (<font color='blue'><b>Laurie</b></font>) had no thought of a
melodramatic plunge, but some blind instinct led him (<font color='blue'><b>Laurie</b></font>) to fling hat and
coat into his (<font color='blue'><b>Laurie</b></font>) boat, and row away with all his (<font color='blue'><b>Laurie</b></font>) might, making better time
up the river than he (<font color='blue'><b>Laurie</b></font>) had done in any race. Jo drew a long breath and
unclasped her (<font color='blue'><b>Jo</b></font>) hands as she (<font color='blue'><b>Jo</b></font>) watched the poor fellow trying to outstrip
the trouble which he (<font color='blue'><b>fellow</b></font>) carried in his (<font color='blue'><b>fellow</b></font>) heart.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``That will do him (<font color='blue'><b>devil</b></font>) good, and he (<font color='blue'><b>devil</b></font>)'ll come home in such a tender, penitent
state of mind, that I shan't dare to see him (<font color='blue'><b>devil</b></font>),''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Jo</b></font>) said, adding, as she (<font color='blue'><b>Jo</b></font>)
went slowly home, feeling as if she (<font color='blue'><b>Jo</b></font>) had murdered some innocent thing,
and buried it under the leaves. <div class="bookquote">``Now I must go and prepare Mr.
Laurence to be very kind to my poor boy. I wish he (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>)'d love Beth,
perhaps he (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>) may in time, but I begin to think I was mistaken about her (<font color='blue'><b>Beth</b></font>).
Oh dear! How can girls like to have lovers and refuse them? I think
it's dreadful.''

 (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div><p/>Being sure that no one could do it so well as herself, she (<font color='blue'><b>Jo</b></font>) went
straight to Mr. Laurence, told the hard story bravely through, and then
broke down, crying so dismally over her (<font color='blue'><b>Jo</b></font>) own insensibility that the kind
old gentleman, though sorely disappointed, did not utter a reproach.
He (<font color='blue'><b>gentleman</b></font>) found it difficult to understand how any girl could help loving
Laurie, and hoped she (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) would change her (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) mind, but he (<font color='blue'><b>Laurie</b></font>) knew even better
than Jo that love cannot be forced, so he (<font color='blue'><b>Laurie</b></font>) shook his (<font color='blue'><b>Laurie</b></font>) head sadly and
resolved to carry his (<font color='blue'><b>Laurie</b></font>) boy out of harm's way, for Young Impetuosity's
parting words to Jo disturbed him (<font color='blue'><b>Young</b></font>) more than he (<font color='blue'><b>Young</b></font>) would confess.

<p/>When Laurie came home, dead tired but quite composed, his (<font color='blue'><b>Laurie</b></font>) grandfather
met him (<font color='blue'><b>Laurie</b></font>) as if he (<font color='blue'><b>Laurie</b></font>) knew nothing, and kept up the delusion very
successfully for an hour or two. But when they sat together in the
twilight, the time they used to enjoy so much, it was hard work for the
old man to ramble on as usual, and harder still for the young one to
listen to praises of the last year's success, which to him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) now seemed
like love's labor lost. He (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) bore it as long as he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) could, then went to
his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) piano and began to play. The windows were open, and Jo, walking
in the garden with Beth, for once understood music better than her (<font color='blue'><b>Jo</b></font>)
sister, for he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) played the '_Sonata Pathetique_', and played it as he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>)
never did before.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``That's very fine, I dare say, but it's sad enough to make one cry.
Give us something gayer, lad,''  (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Laurence/Laurence/LAURENCE</b></font>)</div>said Mr. Laurence, whose kind old heart
was full of sympathy, which he (<font color='blue'><b>Laurence</b></font>) longed to show but knew not how.

<p/>Laurie dashed into a livelier strain, played stormily for several
minutes, and would have got through bravely, if in a momentary lull
Mrs. March's voice had not been heard calling, <div class="bookquote">``Jo, dear, come in. I
want you.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Laurie/Mr. Laurie/LAURIE</b></font>)</div><p/>Just what Laurie longed to say, with a different meaning! As he (<font color='blue'><b>Laurie</b></font>)
listened, he (<font color='blue'><b>Laurie</b></font>) lost his (<font color='blue'><b>Laurie</b></font>) place, the music ended with a broken chord, and
the musician sat silent in the dark.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``I can't stand this,''  (<font color='red'><b>the gentleman</b></font>)</div>muttered the old gentleman. Up he (<font color='blue'><b>gentleman</b></font>) got, groped
his (<font color='blue'><b>gentleman</b></font>) way to the piano, laid a kind hand on either of the broad
shoulders, and said, as gently as a woman, <div class="bookquote">``I know, my boy, I know.''

 (<font color='red'><b>a woman</b></font>)</div><p/>No answer for an instant, then Laurie asked sharply, <div class="bookquote">``Who told you?''

 (<font color='red'><b>Laurie/Mr. Laurie/LAURIE</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Jo herself.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Then there's an end of it!''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>And he (<font color='blue'><b>Laurie</b></font>) shook off his (<font color='blue'><b>Laurie</b></font>) grandfather's hands
with an impatient motion, for though grateful for the sympathy, his (<font color='blue'><b>Laurie</b></font>)
man's pride could not bear a man's pity.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Not quite. I want to say one thing, and then there shall be an end of
it,''  (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Laurence/Laurence/LAURENCE</b></font>)</div>returned Mr. Laurence with unusual mildness. <div class="bookquote">``You won't care to
stay at home now, perhaps?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I don't intend to run away from a girl. Jo can't prevent my seeing
her (<font color='blue'><b>Jo</b></font>), and I shall stay and do it as long as I like,''  (<font color='red'><b>Laurie/Mr. Laurie/LAURIE</b></font>)</div>interrupted Laurie
in a defiant tone.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Not if you are the gentleman I think you. I'm disappointed, but the
girl can't help it, and the only thing left for you to do is to go away
for a time. Where will you go?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Anywhere. I don't care what becomes of me,''  (<font color='red'><b>Laurie/Mr. Laurie/LAURIE</b></font>)</div>and Laurie got up with a
reckless laugh that grated on his (<font color='blue'><b>Laurie</b></font>) grandfather's ear.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Take it like a man, and don't do anything rash, for God's sake. Why
not go abroad, as you planned, and forget it?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I can't.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``But you've been wild to go, and I promised you should when you got
through college.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Ah, but I didn't mean to go alone!''  (<font color='red'><b>Laurie/Mr. Laurie/LAURIE</b></font>)</div>and Laurie walked fast through the
room with an expression which it was well his (<font color='blue'><b>Laurie</b></font>) grandfather did not see.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``I don't ask you to go alone. There's someone ready and glad to go
with you, anywhere in the world.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Who, Sir?''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>stopping to listen.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Myself.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Laurie/Mr. Laurie/LAURIE</b></font>)</div><p/>Laurie came back as quickly as he (<font color='blue'><b>Laurie</b></font>) went, and put out his (<font color='blue'><b>Laurie</b></font>) hand, saying
huskily, <div class="bookquote">``I'm a selfish brute, but--you know--Grandfather--''

 (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Lord help me, yes, I do know, for I've been through it all before,
once in my own young days, and then with your father. Now, my dear boy,
just sit quietly down and hear my plan. It's all settled, and can be
carried out at once,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>said Mr. Laurence, keeping hold of the young man,
as if fearful that he (<font color='blue'><b>Laurence</b></font>) would break away as his (<font color='blue'><b>Laurence</b></font>) father had done before
him (<font color='blue'><b>Laurence</b></font>).

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Well, sir, what is it?''  (<font color='red'><b>Laurie/Mr. Laurie/LAURIE</b></font>)</div>and Laurie sat down, without a sign of
interest in face or voice.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``There is business in London that needs looking after. I meant you
should attend to it, but I can do it better myself, and things here
will get on very well with Brooke to manage them. My partners do
almost everything, I'm merely holding on until you take my place, and
can be off at any time.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``But you hate traveling, Sir. I can't ask it of you at your age,''
 (<font color='red'><b>Laurie/Mr. Laurie/LAURIE</b></font>)</div>began Laurie, who was grateful for the sacrifice, but much preferred to
go alone, if he (<font color='blue'><b>Laurie</b></font>) went at all.

<p/>The old gentleman knew that perfectly well, and particularly desired to
prevent it, for the mood in which he (<font color='blue'><b>gentleman</b></font>) found his (<font color='blue'><b>gentleman</b></font>) grandson assured him (<font color='blue'><b>gentleman</b></font>)
that it would not be wise to leave him (<font color='blue'><b>gentleman</b></font>) to his (<font color='blue'><b>gentleman</b></font>) own devices. So,
stifling a natural regret at the thought of the home comforts he (<font color='blue'><b>gentleman</b></font>) would
leave behind him (<font color='blue'><b>gentleman</b></font>), he (<font color='blue'><b>gentleman</b></font>) said stoutly, <div class="bookquote">``Bless your soul, I'm not
superannuated yet. I quite enjoy the idea. It will do me good, and my
old bones won't suffer, for traveling nowadays is almost as easy as
sitting in a chair.''

 (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div><p/>A restless movement from Laurie suggested that his (<font color='blue'><b>Laurie</b></font>) chair was not easy,
or that he (<font color='blue'><b>Laurie</b></font>) did not like the plan, and made the old man add hastily, <div class="bookquote">``I
don't mean to be a marplot or a burden. I go because I think you'd feel
happier than if I was left behind. I don't intend to gad about with
you, but leave you free to go where you like, while I amuse myself in
my own way. I've friends in London and Paris, and should like to visit
them. Meantime you can go to Italy, Germany, Switzerland, where you
will, and enjoy pictures, music, scenery, and adventures to your
heart's content.''

 (<font color='red'><b>the man</b></font>)</div><p/>Now, Laurie felt just then that his (<font color='blue'><b>Laurie</b></font>) heart was entirely broken and the
world a howling wilderness, but at the sound of certain words which the
old gentleman artfully introduced into his (<font color='blue'><b>gentleman</b></font>) closing sentence, the broken
heart gave an unexpected leap, and a green oasis or two suddenly
appeared in the howling wilderness. He (<font color='blue'><b>gentleman</b></font>) sighed, and then said, in a
spiritless tone, <div class="bookquote">``Just as you like, Sir. It doesn't matter where I go
or what I do.''

 (<font color='red'><b>He</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``It does to me, remember that, my lad. I give you entire liberty, but
I trust you to make an honest use of it. Promise me that, Laurie.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Anything you like, Sir.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Good,''  (<font color='red'><b>the gentleman</b></font>)</div>thought the old gentleman. <div class="bookquote">``You don't care now, but there'll
come a time when that promise will keep you out of mischief, or I'm
much mistaken.''

 (<font color='red'><b>an individual</b></font>)</div><p/>Being an energetic individual, Mr. Laurence struck while the iron was
hot, and before the blighted being recovered spirit enough to rebel,
they were off. During the time necessary for preparation, Laurie bore
himself as young gentleman usually do in such cases. He (<font color='blue'><b>Laurie</b></font>) was moody,
irritable, and pensive by turns, lost his (<font color='blue'><b>Laurie</b></font>) appetite, neglected his (<font color='blue'><b>Laurie</b></font>) dress
and devoted much time to playing tempestuously on his (<font color='blue'><b>Laurie</b></font>) piano, avoided
Jo, but consoled himself by staring at her (<font color='blue'><b>Jo</b></font>) from his (<font color='blue'><b>Laurie</b></font>) window, with a
tragic face that haunted her (<font color='blue'><b>Jo</b></font>) dreams by night and oppressed her (<font color='blue'><b>Jo</b></font>) with a
heavy sense of guilt by day. Unlike some sufferers, he (<font color='blue'><b>Laurie</b></font>) never spoke of
his (<font color='blue'><b>Laurie</b></font>) unrequited passion, and would allow no one, not even Mrs. March, to
attempt consolation or offer sympathy. On some accounts, this was a
relief to his (<font color='blue'><b>Laurie</b></font>) friends, but the weeks before his (<font color='blue'><b>Laurie</b></font>) departure were very
uncomfortable, and everyone rejoiced that the `poor, dear fellow was
going away to forget his (<font color='blue'><b>fellow</b></font>) trouble, and come home happy'. Of course, he (<font color='blue'><b>fellow</b></font>)
smiled darkly at their delusion, but passed it by with the sad
superiority of one who knew that his (<font color='blue'><b>fellow</b></font>) fidelity like his (<font color='blue'><b>fellow</b></font>) love was
unalterable.

<p/>When the parting came he (<font color='blue'><b>fellow</b></font>) affected high spirits, to conceal certain
inconvenient emotions which seemed inclined to assert themselves. This
gaiety did not impose upon anybody, but they tried to look as if it did
for his (<font color='blue'><b>fellow</b></font>) sake, and he (<font color='blue'><b>fellow</b></font>) got on very well till Mrs. March kissed him (<font color='blue'><b>fellow</b></font>), with
a whisper full of motherly solicitude. Then feeling that he (<font color='blue'><b>fellow</b></font>) was going
very fast, he (<font color='blue'><b>fellow</b></font>) hastily embraced them all round, not forgetting the
afflicted Hannah, and ran downstairs as if for his (<font color='blue'><b>fellow</b></font>) life. Jo followed a
minute after to wave her (<font color='blue'><b>Jo</b></font>) hand to him (<font color='blue'><b>fellow</b></font>) if he (<font color='blue'><b>fellow</b></font>) looked round. He (<font color='blue'><b>fellow</b></font>) did look
round, came back, put his (<font color='blue'><b>fellow</b></font>) arms about her (<font color='blue'><b>Jo</b></font>) as she (<font color='blue'><b>Jo</b></font>) stood on the step above
him (<font color='blue'><b>fellow</b></font>), and looked up at her (<font color='blue'><b>Jo</b></font>) with a face that made his (<font color='blue'><b>fellow</b></font>) short appeal
eloquent and pathetic.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Oh, Jo, can't you?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Teddy, dear, I wish I could!''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/>That was all, except a little pause. Then Laurie straightened himself
up, said, <div class="bookquote">``It's all right, never mind,''  (<font color='red'><b>Laurie/Mr. Laurie/LAURIE</b></font>)</div>and went away without another
word. Ah, but it wasn't all right, and Jo did mind, for while the
curly head lay on her (<font color='blue'><b>Jo</b></font>) arm a minute after her (<font color='blue'><b>Jo</b></font>) hard answer, she (<font color='blue'><b>Jo</b></font>) felt as
if she (<font color='blue'><b>Jo</b></font>) had stabbed her (<font color='blue'><b>Jo</b></font>) dearest friend, and when he (<font color='blue'><b>friend</b></font>) left her (<font color='blue'><b>Jo</b></font>) without a
look behind him (<font color='blue'><b>friend</b></font>), she (<font color='blue'><b>Jo</b></font>) knew that the boy Laurie never would come again.



<p/>CHAPTER THIRTY-SIX

<p/>BETH``S SECRET

<p/>When Jo came home that spring, she (<font color='blue'><b>Jo</b></font>) had been struck with the change in
Beth. No one spoke of it or seemed aware of it, for it had come too
gradually to startle those who saw her (<font color='blue'><b>Beth</b></font>) daily, but to eyes sharpened by
absence, it was very plain and a heavy weight fell on Jo's heart as she (<font color='blue'><b>Jo</b></font>)
saw her (<font color='blue'><b>Jo</b></font>) sister's face. It was no paler and but littler thinner than in
the autumn, yet there was a strange, transparent look about it, as if
the mortal was being slowly refined away, and the immortal shining
through the frail flesh with an indescribably pathetic beauty. Jo saw
and felt it, but said nothing at the time, and soon the first
impression lost much of its power, for Beth seemed happy, no one
appeared to doubt that she (<font color='blue'><b>Beth</b></font>) was better, and presently in other cares Jo
for a time forgot her (<font color='blue'><b>Jo</b></font>) fear.

<p/>But when Laurie was gone, and peace prevailed again, the vague anxiety
returned and haunted her (<font color='blue'><b>Jo</b></font>). She (<font color='blue'><b>Jo</b></font>) had confessed her (<font color='blue'><b>Jo</b></font>) sins and been
forgiven, but when she (<font color='blue'><b>Jo</b></font>) showed her (<font color='blue'><b>Jo</b></font>) savings and proposed a mountain trip,
Beth had thanked her (<font color='blue'><b>Beth</b></font>) heartily, but begged not to go so far away from
home. Another little visit to the seashore would suit her (<font color='blue'><b>Beth</b></font>) better, and
as Grandma could not be prevailed upon to leave the babies, Jo took
Beth down to the quiet place, where she (<font color='blue'><b>Jo</b></font>) could live much in the open
air, and let the fresh sea breezes blow a little color into her (<font color='blue'><b>Jo</b></font>) pale
cheeks.

<p/>It was not a fashionable place, but even among the pleasant people
there, the girls made few friends, preferring to live for one another.
Beth was too shy to enjoy society, and Jo too wrapped up in her (<font color='blue'><b>Jo</b></font>) to care
for anyone else. So they were all in all to each other, and came and
went, quite unconscious of the interest they excited in those about
them, who watched with sympathetic eyes the strong sister and the
feeble one, always together, as if they felt instinctively that a long
separation was not far away.

<p/>They did feel it, yet neither spoke of it, for often between ourselves
and those nearest and dearest to us there exists a reserve which it is
very hard to overcome. Jo felt as if a veil had fallen between her (<font color='blue'><b>Jo</b></font>)
heart and Beth's, but when she (<font color='blue'><b>Beth</b></font>) put out her (<font color='blue'><b>Beth</b></font>) hand to lift it up, there
seemed something sacred in the silence, and she (<font color='blue'><b>Beth</b></font>) waited for Beth to
speak. She (<font color='blue'><b>Beth</b></font>) wondered, and was thankful also, that her (<font color='blue'><b>Beth</b></font>) parents did not
seem to see what she (<font color='blue'><b>Beth</b></font>) saw, and during the quiet weeks when the shadows
grew so plain to her (<font color='blue'><b>Beth</b></font>), she (<font color='blue'><b>Beth</b></font>) said nothing of it to those at home,
believing that it would tell itself when Beth came back no better. She (<font color='blue'><b>Beth</b></font>)
wondered still more if her (<font color='blue'><b>Beth</b></font>) sister really guessed the hard truth, and
what thoughts were passing through her (<font color='blue'><b>Beth</b></font>) mind during the long hours when
she (<font color='blue'><b>Beth</b></font>) lay on the warm rocks with her (<font color='blue'><b>Beth</b></font>) head in Jo's lap, while the winds
blew healthfully over her (<font color='blue'><b>Jo</b></font>) and the sea made music at her (<font color='blue'><b>Jo</b></font>) feet.

<p/>One day Beth told her (<font color='blue'><b>Beth</b></font>). Jo thought she (<font color='blue'><b>Jo</b></font>) was asleep, she (<font color='blue'><b>Jo</b></font>) lay so still,
and putting down her (<font color='blue'><b>Jo</b></font>) book, sat looking at her (<font color='blue'><b>Jo</b></font>) with wistful eyes, trying
to see signs of hope in the faint color on Beth's cheeks. But she (<font color='blue'><b>Beth</b></font>)
could not find enough to satisfy her (<font color='blue'><b>Beth</b></font>), for the cheeks were very thin,
and the hands seemed too feeble to hold even the rosy little shells
they had been collecting. It came to her (<font color='blue'><b>Beth</b></font>) then more bitterly than ever
that Beth was slowly drifting away from her (<font color='blue'><b>Beth</b></font>), and her (<font color='blue'><b>Beth</b></font>) arms instinctively
tightened their hold upon the dearest treasure she (<font color='blue'><b>Beth</b></font>) possessed. For a
minute her (<font color='blue'><b>Beth</b></font>) eyes were too dim for seeing, and when they cleared, Beth
was looking up at her (<font color='blue'><b>Beth</b></font>) so tenderly that there was hardly any need for
her (<font color='blue'><b>Beth</b></font>) to say, <div class="bookquote">``Jo, dear, I'm glad you know it. I've tried to tell you,
but I couldn't.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Beth</b></font>)</div><p/>There was no answer except her (<font color='blue'><b>Jo</b></font>) sister's cheek against her (<font color='blue'><b>Jo</b></font>) own, not even
tears, for when most deeply moved, Jo did not cry. She (<font color='blue'><b>Jo</b></font>) was the weaker
then, and Beth tried to comfort and sustain her (<font color='blue'><b>Beth</b></font>), with her (<font color='blue'><b>Beth</b></font>) arms about
her (<font color='blue'><b>Beth</b></font>) and the soothing words she (<font color='blue'><b>Beth</b></font>) whispered in her (<font color='blue'><b>Beth</b></font>) ear.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``I've known it for a good while, dear, and now I'm used to it, it isn't
hard to think of or to bear. Try to see it so and don't be troubled
about me, because it's best, indeed it is.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Is this what made you so unhappy in the autumn, Beth? You did not feel
it then, and keep it to yourself so long, did you?''  (<font color='red'><b>Jo/Miss Jo/JO</b></font>)</div>asked Jo, refusing
to see or say that it was best, but glad to know that Laurie had no
part in Beth's trouble.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Yes, I gave up hoping then, but I didn't like to own it. I tried to
think it was a sick fancy, and would not let it trouble anyone. But
when I saw you all so well and strong and full of happy plans, it was
hard to feel that I could never be like you, and then I was miserable,
Jo.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Oh, Beth, and you didn't tell me, didn't let me comfort and help you?
How could you shut me out, bear it all alone?''

 (<font color='red'><b>Jo/Miss Jo/JO</b></font>)</div><p/>Jo's voice was full of tender reproach, and her (<font color='blue'><b>Jo</b></font>) heart ached to think of
the solitary struggle that must have gone on while Beth learned to say
goodbye to health, love, and life, and take up her (<font color='blue'><b>Beth</b></font>) cross so cheerfully.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Perhaps it was wrong, but I tried to do right. I wasn't sure, no one
said anything, and I hoped I was mistaken. It would have been selfish
to frighten you all when Marmee was so anxious about Meg, and Amy away,
and you so happy with Laurie--at least I thought so then.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``And I thought you loved him (<font color='blue'><b>Laurie</b></font>), Beth, and I went away because I
couldn't,''  (<font color='red'><b>Jo/Miss Jo/JO</b></font>)</div>cried Jo, glad to say all the truth.

<p/>Beth looked so amazed at the idea that Jo smiled in spite of her (<font color='blue'><b>Jo</b></font>) pain,
and added softly, <div class="bookquote">``Then you didn't, dearie? I was afraid it was so, and
imagined your poor little heart full of lovelornity all that while.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Jo/Miss Jo/JO</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Why, Jo, how could I, when he (<font color='blue'><b>Laurie</b></font>) was so fond of you?''  (<font color='red'><b>Beth</b></font>)</div>asked Beth, as
innocently as a child. <div class="bookquote">``I do love him (<font color='blue'><b>Laurie</b></font>) dearly. He (<font color='blue'><b>Laurie</b></font>) is so good to me,
how can I help It? But he (<font color='blue'><b>Laurie</b></font>) could never be anything to me but my
brother. I hope he (<font color='blue'><b>Laurie</b></font>) truly will be, sometime.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Not through me,''  (<font color='red'><b>Jo/Miss Jo/JO</b></font>)</div>said Jo decidedly. <div class="bookquote">``Amy is left for him (<font color='blue'><b>Laurie</b></font>), and they
would suit excellently, but I have no heart for such things, now. I
don't care what becomes of anybody but you, Beth. You must get well.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I want to, oh, so much! I try, but every day I lose a little, and
feel more sure that I shall never gain it back. It's like the tide,
Jo, when it turns, it goes slowly, but it can't be stopped.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``It shall be stopped, your tide must not turn so soon, nineteen is too
young, Beth. I can't let you go. I'll work and pray and fight against
it. I'll keep you in spite of everything. There must be ways, it
can't be too late. God won't be so cruel as to take you from me,''
 (<font color='red'><b>Jo/Miss Jo/JO</b></font>)</div>cried poor Jo rebelliously, for her (<font color='blue'><b>Jo</b></font>) spirit was far less piously
submissive than Beth's.

<p/>Simple, sincere people seldom speak much of their piety. It shows
itself in acts rather than in words, and has more influence than
homilies or protestations. Beth could not reason upon or explain the
faith that gave her (<font color='blue'><b>Beth</b></font>) courage and patience to give up life, and
cheerfully wait for death. Like a confiding child, she (<font color='blue'><b>Beth</b></font>) asked no
questions, but left everything to God and nature, Father and Mother of
us all, feeling sure that they, and they only, could teach and
strengthen heart and spirit for this life and the life to come. She (<font color='blue'><b>Mother</b></font>)
did not rebuke Jo with saintly speeches, only loved her (<font color='blue'><b>Jo</b></font>) better for her (<font color='blue'><b>Jo</b></font>)
passionate affection, and clung more closely to the dear human love,
from which our Father never means us to be weaned, but through which He (<font color='blue'><b>Father</b></font>)
draws us closer to Himself. She (<font color='blue'><b>Jo</b></font>) could not say, <div class="bookquote">``I'm glad to go,''  (<font color='red'><b>She</b></font>)</div>for
life was very sweet for her (<font color='blue'><b>Jo</b></font>). She (<font color='blue'><b>Jo</b></font>) could only sob out, <div class="bookquote">``I try to be
willing,''  (<font color='red'><b>She</b></font>)</div>while she (<font color='blue'><b>Jo</b></font>) held fast to Jo, as the first bitter wave of this
great sorrow broke over them together.

<p/>By and by Beth said, with recovered serenity, <div class="bookquote">``You'll tell them this
when we go home?''

 (<font color='red'><b>Beth</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I think they will see it without words,''  (<font color='red'><b>Jo/Miss Jo/JO</b></font>)</div>sighed Jo, for now it seemed
to her (<font color='blue'><b>Jo</b></font>) that Beth changed every day.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Perhaps not. I've heard that the people who love best are often
blindest to such things. If they don't see it, you will tell them for
me. I don't want any secrets, and it's kinder to prepare them. Meg
has John and the babies to comfort her (<font color='blue'><b>John</b></font>), but you must stand by Father
and Mother, won't you Jo?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``If I can. But, Beth, I don't give up yet. I'm going to believe that
it is a sick fancy, and not let you think it's true.''  (<font color='red'><b>Jo/Miss Jo/JO</b></font>)</div>said Jo, trying
to speak cheerfully.

<p/>Beth lay a minute thinking, and then said in her (<font color='blue'><b>Beth</b></font>) quiet way, <div class="bookquote">``I don't
know how to express myself, and shouldn't try to anyone but you,
because I can't speak out except to my Jo. I only mean to say that I
have a feeling that it never was intended I should live long. I'm not
like the rest of you. I never made any plans about what I'd do when I
grew up. I never thought of being married, as you all did. I couldn't
seem to imagine myself anything but stupid little Beth, trotting about
at home, of no use anywhere but there. I never wanted to go away, and
the hard part now is the leaving you all. I'm not afraid, but it seems
as if I should be homesick for you even in heaven.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Beth</b></font>)</div><p/>Jo could not speak, and for several minutes there was no sound but the
sigh of the wind and the lapping of the tide. A white-winged gull flew
by, with the flash of sunshine on its silvery breast. Beth watched it
till it vanished, and her (<font color='blue'><b>Beth</b></font>) eyes were full of sadness. A little
gray-coated sand bird came tripping over the beach `peeping' softly to
itself, as if enjoying the sun and sea. It came quite close to Beth,
and looked at her (<font color='blue'><b>Beth</b></font>) with a friendly eye and sat upon a warm stone,
dressing its wet feathers, quite at home. Beth smiled and felt
comforted, for the tiny thing seemed to offer its small friendship and
remind her (<font color='blue'><b>Beth</b></font>) that a pleasant world was still to be enjoyed.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Dear little bird! See, Jo, how tame it is. I like peeps better than
the gulls. They are not so wild and handsome, but they seem happy,
confiding little things. I used to call them my birds last summer, and
Mother said they reminded her (<font color='blue'><b>Mother</b></font>) of me--busy, quaker-colored creatures,
always near the shore, and always chirping that contented little song
of theirs. You are the gull, Jo, strong and wild, fond of the storm
and the wind, flying far out to sea, and happy all alone. Meg is the
turtledove, and Amy is like the lark she (<font color='blue'><b>Amy</b></font>) writes about, trying to get up
among the clouds, but always dropping down into its nest again. Dear
little girl! She (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>)'s so ambitious, but her (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) heart is good and tender, and
no matter how high she (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) flies, she (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) never will forget home. I hope I
shall see her (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) again, but she (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) seems so far away.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``She (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) is coming in the spring, and I mean that you shall be all ready to
see and enjoy her (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>). I'm going to have you well and rosy by that time,''
 (<font color='red'><b>Jo/Miss Jo/JO</b></font>)</div>began Jo, feeling that of all the changes in Beth, the talking change
was the greatest, for it seemed to cost no effort now, and she (<font color='blue'><b>Beth</b></font>) thought
aloud in a way quite unlike bashful Beth.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Jo, dear, don't hope any more. It won't do any good. I'm sure of
that. We won't be miserable, but enjoy being together while we wait.
We'll have happy times, for I don't suffer much, and I think the tide
will go out easily, if you help me.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Jo/Miss Jo/JO</b></font>)</div><p/>Jo leaned down to kiss the tranquil face, and with that silent kiss,
she (<font color='blue'><b>Jo</b></font>) dedicated herself soul and body to Beth.

<p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>Beth</b></font>) was right. There was no need of any words when they got home, for
Father and Mother saw plainly now what they had prayed to be saved from
seeing. Tired with her (<font color='blue'><b>Mother</b></font>) short journey, Beth went at once to bed, saying
how glad she (<font color='blue'><b>Beth</b></font>) was to be home, and when Jo went down, she (<font color='blue'><b>Jo</b></font>) found that she (<font color='blue'><b>Jo</b></font>)
would be spared the hard task of telling Beth's secret. Her (<font color='blue'><b>Beth</b></font>) father
stood leaning his (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) head on the mantelpiece and did not turn as she (<font color='blue'><b>Beth</b></font>) came
in, but her (<font color='blue'><b>Beth</b></font>) mother stretched out her (<font color='blue'><b>Beth</b></font>) arms as if for help, and Jo went
to comfort her (<font color='blue'><b>Jo</b></font>) without a word.



<p/>CHAPTER THIRTY-SEVEN

<p/>NEW IMPRESSIONS

<p/>At three o'clock in the afternoon, all the fashionable world at Nice
may be seen on the Promenade des Anglais--a charming place, for the
wide walk, bordered with palms, flowers, and tropical shrubs, is
bounded on one side by the sea, on the other by the grand drive, lined
with hotels and villas, while beyond lie orange orchards and the hills.
Many nations are represented, many languages spoken, many costumes
worn, and on a sunny day the spectacle is as gay and brilliant as a
carnival. Haughty English, lively French, sober Germans, handsome
Spaniards, ugly Russians, meek Jews, free-and-easy Americans, all
drive, sit, or saunter here, chatting over the news, and criticizing
the latest celebrity who has arrived--Ristori or Dickens, Victor
Emmanuel or the Queen of the Sandwich Islands. The equipages are as
varied as the company and attract as much attention, especially the low
basket barouches in which ladies drive themselves, with a pair of
dashing ponies, gay nets to keep their voluminous flounces from
overflowing the diminutive vehicles, and little grooms on the perch
behind.

<p/>Along this walk, on Christmas Day, a tall young man walked slowly, with
his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) hands behind him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>), and a somewhat absent expression of countenance.
He (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) looked like an Italian, was dressed like an Englishman, and had the
independent air of an American--a combination which caused sundry pairs
of feminine eyes to look approvingly after him (<font color='blue'><b>Englishman</b></font>), and sundry dandies in
black velvet suits, with rose-colored neckties, buff gloves, and orange
flowers in their buttonholes, to shrug their shoulders, and then envy
him (<font color='blue'><b>Englishman</b></font>) his (<font color='blue'><b>Englishman</b></font>) inches. There were plenty of pretty faces to admire, but the
young man took little notice of them, except to glance now and then at
some blonde girl in blue. Presently he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) strolled out of the promenade
and stood a moment at the crossing, as if undecided whether to go and
listen to the band in the Jardin Publique, or to wander along the beach
toward Castle Hill. The quick trot of ponies' feet made him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) look up,
as one of the little carriages, containing a single young lady, came
rapidly down the street. The lady was young, blonde, and dressed in
blue. He (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) stared a minute, then his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) whole face woke up, and, waving his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>)
hat like a boy, he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) hurried forward to meet her (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>).

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Oh, Laurie, is it really you? I thought you'd never come!''  (<font color='red'><b>Amy/Amy March</b></font>)</div>cried Amy,
dropping the reins and holding out both hands, to the great
scandalization of a French mamma, who hastened her (<font color='blue'><b>Amy</b></font>) daughter's steps,
lest she (<font color='blue'><b>Amy</b></font>) should be demoralized by beholding the free manners of these
`mad English'.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``I was detained by the way, but I promised to spend Christmas with you,
and here I am.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``How is your grandfather? When did you come? Where are you staying?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Very well--last night--at the Chauvain. I called at your hotel, but
you were out.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I have so much to say, I don't know where to begin! Get in and we can
talk at our ease. I was going for a drive and longing for company.
Flo's saving up for tonight.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``What happens then, a ball?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``A Christmas party at our hotel. There are many Americans there, and
they give it in honor of the day. You'll go with us, of course? Aunt
will be charmed.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Thank you. Where now?''  (<font color='red'><b>Laurie/Mr. Laurie/LAURIE</b></font>)</div>asked Laurie, leaning back and folding his (<font color='blue'><b>Laurie</b></font>)
arms, a proceeding which suited Amy, who preferred to drive, for her (<font color='blue'><b>Amy</b></font>)
parasol whip and blue reins over the white ponies' backs afforded her (<font color='blue'><b>Amy</b></font>)
infinite satisfaction.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``I'm going to the bankers first for letters, and then to Castle Hill.
The view is so lovely, and I like to feed the peacocks. Have you ever
been there?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Often, years ago, but I don't mind having a look at it.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Now tell me all about yourself. The last I heard of you, your
grandfather wrote that he (<font color='blue'><b>grandfather</b></font>) expected you from Berlin.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Yes, I spent a month there and then joined him (<font color='blue'><b>grandfather</b></font>) in Paris, where he (<font color='blue'><b>grandfather</b></font>) has
settled for the winter. He (<font color='blue'><b>grandfather</b></font>) has friends there and finds plenty to amuse
him (<font color='blue'><b>grandfather</b></font>), so I go and come, and we get on capitally.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``That's a sociable arrangement,''  (<font color='red'><b>Amy/Amy March</b></font>)</div>said Amy, missing something in
Laurie's manner, though she (<font color='blue'><b>Amy</b></font>) couldn't tell what.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Why, you see, he (<font color='blue'><b>grandfather</b></font>) hates to travel, and I hate to keep still, so we each
suit ourselves, and there is no trouble. I am often with him (<font color='blue'><b>grandfather</b></font>), and he (<font color='blue'><b>grandfather</b></font>)
enjoys my adventures, while I like to feel that someone is glad to see
me when I get back from my wanderings. Dirty old hole, isn't it?''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Laurie</b></font>)
added, with a look of disgust as they drove along the boulevard to the
Place Napoleon in the old city.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``The dirt is picturesque, so I don't mind. The river and the hills are
delicious, and these glimpses of the narrow cross streets are my
delight. Now we shall have to wait for that procession to pass. It's
going to the Church of St. John.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Laurie/Mr. Laurie/LAURIE</b></font>)</div><p/>While Laurie listlessly watched the procession of priests under their
canopies, white-veiled nuns bearing lighted tapers, and some
brotherhood in blue chanting as they walked, Amy watched him (<font color='blue'><b>Laurie</b></font>), and felt
a new sort of shyness steal over her (<font color='blue'><b>Amy</b></font>), for he (<font color='blue'><b>Laurie</b></font>) was changed, and she (<font color='blue'><b>Amy</b></font>) could
not find the merry-faced boy she (<font color='blue'><b>Amy</b></font>) left in the moody-looking man beside
her (<font color='blue'><b>Amy</b></font>). He (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) was handsomer than ever and greatly improved, she (<font color='blue'><b>Amy</b></font>) thought, but
now that the flush of pleasure at meeting her (<font color='blue'><b>Amy</b></font>) was over, he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) looked tired
and spiritless--not sick, nor exactly unhappy, but older and graver
than a year or two of prosperous life should have made him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>). She (<font color='blue'><b>Amy</b></font>)
couldn't understand it and did not venture to ask questions, so she (<font color='blue'><b>Amy</b></font>)
shook her (<font color='blue'><b>Amy</b></font>) head and touched up her (<font color='blue'><b>Amy</b></font>) ponies, as the procession wound away
across the arches of the Paglioni bridge and vanished in the church.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Que pensez-vous?''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Amy</b></font>) said, airing her (<font color='blue'><b>Amy</b></font>) French, which had improved in
quantity, if not in quality, since she (<font color='blue'><b>Amy</b></font>) came abroad.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``That mademoiselle has made good use of her (<font color='blue'><b>me</b></font>) time, and the result is
charming,''  (<font color='red'><b>Laurie/Mr. Laurie/LAURIE</b></font>)</div>replied Laurie, bowing with his (<font color='blue'><b>Laurie</b></font>) hand on his (<font color='blue'><b>Laurie</b></font>) heart and an
admiring look.

<p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>Amy</b></font>) blushed with pleasure, but somehow the compliment did not satisfy
her (<font color='blue'><b>Amy</b></font>) like the blunt praises he (<font color='blue'><b>Laurie</b></font>) used to give her (<font color='blue'><b>Amy</b></font>) at home, when he (<font color='blue'><b>Laurie</b></font>)
promenaded round her (<font color='blue'><b>Amy</b></font>) on festival occasions, and told her (<font color='blue'><b>Amy</b></font>) she (<font color='blue'><b>Amy</b></font>) was
`altogether jolly', with a hearty smile and an approving pat on the
head. She (<font color='blue'><b>Amy</b></font>) didn't like the new tone, for though not blase, it sounded
indifferent in spite of the look.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``If that's the way he (<font color='blue'><b>John</b></font>)'s going to grow up, I wish he (<font color='blue'><b>John</b></font>)'d stay a boy,''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Amy</b></font>)
thought, with a curious sense of disappointment and discomfort, trying
meantime to seem quite easy and gay.

<p/>At Avigdor's she (<font color='blue'><b>Amy</b></font>) found the precious home letters and, giving the reins
to Laurie, read them luxuriously as they wound up the shady road
between green hedges, where tea roses bloomed as freshly as in June.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Beth is very poorly, Mother says. I often think I ought to go home,
but they all say `stay'. So I do, for I shall never have another
chance like this,''  (<font color='red'><b>Amy/Amy March</b></font>)</div>said Amy, looking sober over one page.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``I think you are right, there. You could do nothing at home, and it is
a great comfort to them to know that you are well and happy, and
enjoying so much, my dear.''

 (<font color='red'><b>He</b></font>)</div><p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Laurie</b></font>) drew a little nearer, and looked more like his (<font color='blue'><b>Laurie</b></font>) old self as he (<font color='blue'><b>Laurie</b></font>) said
that, and the fear that sometimes weighed on Amy's heart was lightened,
for the look, the act, the brotherly `my dear', seemed to assure her (<font color='blue'><b>Amy</b></font>)
that if any trouble did come, she (<font color='blue'><b>Amy</b></font>) would not be alone in a strange land.
Presently she (<font color='blue'><b>Amy</b></font>) laughed and showed him (<font color='blue'><b>Laurie</b></font>) a small sketch of Jo in her (<font color='blue'><b>Jo</b></font>)
scribbling suit, with the bow rampantly erect upon her (<font color='blue'><b>Jo</b></font>) cap, and issuing
from her (<font color='blue'><b>Jo</b></font>) mouth the words, <div class="bookquote">``Genius burns!'' (<font color='red'><b>Jo/Miss Jo/JO</b></font>)</div>.

<p/>Laurie smiled, took it, put it in his (<font color='blue'><b>Laurie</b></font>) vest pocket `to keep it from
blowing away', and listened with interest to the lively letter Amy read
him (<font color='blue'><b>Laurie</b></font>).

<p/><div class="bookquote">``This will be a regularly merry Christmas to me, with presents in the
morning, you and letters in the afternoon, and a party at night,''  (<font color='red'><b>Amy/Amy March</b></font>)</div>said
Amy, as they alighted among the ruins of the old fort, and a flock of
splendid peacocks came trooping about them, tamely waiting to be fed.
While Amy stood laughing on the bank above him (<font color='blue'><b>Laurie</b></font>) as she (<font color='blue'><b>Amy</b></font>) scattered crumbs
to the brilliant birds, Laurie looked at her (<font color='blue'><b>Amy</b></font>) as she (<font color='blue'><b>Amy</b></font>) had looked at him (<font color='blue'><b>Laurie</b></font>),
with a natural curiosity to see what changes time and absence had
wrought. He (<font color='blue'><b>Laurie</b></font>) found nothing to perplex or disappoint, much to admire and
approve, for overlooking a few little affectations of speech and
manner, she (<font color='blue'><b>Amy</b></font>) was as sprightly and graceful as ever, with the addition of
that indescribable something in dress and bearing which we call
elegance. Always mature for her (<font color='blue'><b>Amy</b></font>) age, she (<font color='blue'><b>Amy</b></font>) had gained a certain aplomb
in both carriage and conversation, which made her (<font color='blue'><b>Amy</b></font>) seem more of a woman
of the world than she (<font color='blue'><b>Amy</b></font>) was, but her (<font color='blue'><b>Amy</b></font>) old petulance now and then showed
itself, her (<font color='blue'><b>Amy</b></font>) strong will still held its own, and her (<font color='blue'><b>Amy</b></font>) native frankness
was unspoiled by foreign polish.

<p/>Laurie did not read all this while he (<font color='blue'><b>Laurie</b></font>) watched her (<font color='blue'><b>Amy</b></font>) feed the peacocks,
but he (<font color='blue'><b>Laurie</b></font>) saw enough to satisfy and interest him (<font color='blue'><b>Laurie</b></font>), and carried away a
pretty little picture of a bright-faced girl standing in the sunshine,
which brought out the soft hue of her (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) dress, the fresh color of her (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>)
cheeks, the golden gloss of her (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) hair, and made her (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) a prominent figure
in the pleasant scene.

<p/>As they came up onto the stone plateau that crowns the hill, Amy waved
her (<font color='blue'><b>Amy</b></font>) hand as if welcoming him (<font color='blue'><b>Laurie</b></font>) to her (<font color='blue'><b>Amy</b></font>) favorite haunt, and said, pointing
here and there, <div class="bookquote">``Do you remember the Cathedral and the Corso, the
fishermen dragging their nets in the bay, and the lovely road to Villa
Franca, Schubert's Tower, just below, and best of all, that speck far
out to sea which they say is Corsica?''

 (<font color='red'><b>him</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I remember. It's not much changed,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Laurie</b></font>) answered without enthusiasm.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``What Jo would give for a sight of that famous speck!''  (<font color='red'><b>Amy/Amy March</b></font>)</div>said Amy,
feeling in good spirits and anxious to see him (<font color='blue'><b>Laurie</b></font>) so also.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Yes,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>was all he (<font color='blue'><b>Laurie</b></font>) said, but he (<font color='blue'><b>Laurie</b></font>) turned and strained his (<font color='blue'><b>Laurie</b></font>) eyes to see the
island which a greater usurper than even Napoleon now made interesting
in his (<font color='blue'><b>Napoleon</b></font>) sight.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Take a good look at it for her (<font color='blue'><b>Jo</b></font>) sake, and then come and tell me what
you have been doing with yourself all this while,''  (<font color='red'><b>Amy/Amy March</b></font>)</div>said Amy, seating
herself, ready for a good talk.

<p/>But she (<font color='blue'><b>Amy</b></font>) did not get it, for though he (<font color='blue'><b>Napoleon</b></font>) joined her (<font color='blue'><b>Amy</b></font>) and answered all her (<font color='blue'><b>Amy</b></font>)
questions freely, she (<font color='blue'><b>Amy</b></font>) could only learn that he (<font color='blue'><b>Napoleon</b></font>) had roved about the
Continent and been to Greece. So after idling away an hour, they drove
home again, and having paid his (<font color='blue'><b>Napoleon</b></font>) respects to Mrs. Carrol, Laurie left
them, promising to return in the evening.

<p/>It must be recorded of Amy that she (<font color='blue'><b>Amy</b></font>) deliberately prinked that night.
Time and absence had done its work on both the young people. She (<font color='blue'><b>Amy</b></font>) had
seen her (<font color='blue'><b>Amy</b></font>) old friend in a new light, not as `our boy', but as a handsome
and agreeable man, and she (<font color='blue'><b>Amy</b></font>) was conscious of a very natural desire to
find favor in his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) sight. Amy knew her (<font color='blue'><b>Amy</b></font>) good points, and made the most
of them with the taste and skill which is a fortune to a poor and
pretty woman.

<p/>Tarlatan and tulle were cheap at Nice, so she (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) enveloped herself in them
on such occasions, and following the sensible English fashion of simple
dress for young girls, got up charming little toilettes with fresh
flowers, a few trinkets, and all manner of dainty devices, which were
both inexpensive and effective. It must be confessed that the artist
sometimes got possession of the woman, and indulged in antique
coiffures, statuesque attitudes, and classic draperies. But, dear
heart, we all have our little weaknesses, and find it easy to pardon
such in the young, who satisfy our eyes with their comeliness, and keep
our hearts merry with their artless vanities.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``I do want him (<font color='blue'><b>Schubert</b></font>) to think I look well, and tell them so at home,''  (<font color='red'><b>Amy/Amy March</b></font>)</div>said
Amy to herself, as she (<font color='blue'><b>Amy</b></font>) put on Flo's old white silk ball dress, and
covered it with a cloud of fresh illusion, out of which her (<font color='blue'><b>Amy</b></font>) white
shoulders and golden head emerged with a most artistic effect. Her (<font color='blue'><b>Amy</b></font>) hair
she (<font color='blue'><b>Amy</b></font>) had the sense to let alone, after gathering up the thick waves and
curls into a Hebe-like knot at the back of her (<font color='blue'><b>Amy</b></font>) head.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``It's not the fashion, but it's becoming, and I can't afford to make a
fright of myself,''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Amy</b></font>) used to say, when advised to frizzle, puff, or
braid, as the latest style commanded.

<p/>Having no ornaments fine enough for this important occasion, Amy looped
her (<font color='blue'><b>Amy</b></font>) fleecy skirts with rosy clusters of azalea, and framed the white
shoulders in delicate green vines. Remembering the painted boots, she (<font color='blue'><b>Amy</b></font>)
surveyed her (<font color='blue'><b>Amy</b></font>) white satin slippers with girlish satisfaction, and
chasseed down the room, admiring her (<font color='blue'><b>Amy</b></font>) aristocratic feet all by herself.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``My new fan just matches my flowers, my gloves fit to a charm, and the
real lace on Aunt's mouchoir gives an air to my whole dress. If I only
had a classical nose and mouth I should be perfectly happy,''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Amy</b></font>) said,
surveying herself with a critical eye and a candle in each hand.

<p/>In spite of this affliction, she (<font color='blue'><b>Amy</b></font>) looked unusually gay and graceful as
she (<font color='blue'><b>Amy</b></font>) glided away. She (<font color='blue'><b>Amy</b></font>) seldom ran--it did not suit her (<font color='blue'><b>Amy</b></font>) style, she (<font color='blue'><b>Amy</b></font>)
thought, for being tall, the stately and Junoesque was more appropriate
than the sportive or piquante. She (<font color='blue'><b>Amy</b></font>) walked up and down the long saloon
while waiting for Laurie, and once arranged herself under the
chandelier, which had a good effect upon her (<font color='blue'><b>Amy</b></font>) hair, then she (<font color='blue'><b>Amy</b></font>) thought
better of it, and went away to the other end of the room, as if ashamed
of the girlish desire to have the first view a propitious one. It so
happened that she (<font color='blue'><b>Amy</b></font>) could not have done a better thing, for Laurie came
in so quietly she (<font color='blue'><b>Amy</b></font>) did not hear him (<font color='blue'><b>Laurie</b></font>), and as she (<font color='blue'><b>Amy</b></font>) stood at the distant
window, with her (<font color='blue'><b>Amy</b></font>) head half turned and one hand gathering up her (<font color='blue'><b>Amy</b></font>) dress,
the slender, white figure against the red curtains was as effective as
a well-placed statue.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Good evening, Diana!''  (<font color='red'><b>Laurie/Mr. Laurie/LAURIE</b></font>)</div>said Laurie, with the look of satisfaction she (<font color='blue'><b>Amy</b></font>)
liked to see in his (<font color='blue'><b>Laurie</b></font>) eyes when they rested on her (<font color='blue'><b>Amy</b></font>).

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Good evening, Apollo!''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Amy</b></font>) answered, smiling back at him (<font color='blue'><b>Laurie</b></font>), for he (<font color='blue'><b>Laurie</b></font>) too
looked unusually debonair, and the thought of entering the ballroom on
the arm of such a personable man caused Amy to pity the four plain
Misses Davis from the bottom of her (<font color='blue'><b>Amy</b></font>) heart.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Here are your flowers. I arranged them myself, remembering that you
didn't like what Hannah calls a `sot-bookay',''  (<font color='red'><b>Laurie/Mr. Laurie/LAURIE</b></font>)</div>said Laurie, handing her (<font color='blue'><b>Amy</b></font>)
a delicate nosegay, in a holder that she (<font color='blue'><b>Amy</b></font>) had long coveted as she (<font color='blue'><b>Amy</b></font>) daily
passed it in Cardiglia's window.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``How kind you are!''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Amy</b></font>) exclaimed gratefully. <div class="bookquote">``If I'd known you were
coming I'd have had something ready for you today, though not as pretty
as this, I'm afraid.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Thank you. It isn't what it should be, but you have improved it,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Laurie</b></font>)
added, as she (<font color='blue'><b>Amy</b></font>) snapped the silver bracelet on her (<font color='blue'><b>Amy</b></font>) wrist.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Please don't.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I thought you liked that sort of thing.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Not from you, it doesn't sound natural, and I like your old bluntness
better.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I'm glad of it,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Laurie</b></font>) answered, with a look of relief, then buttoned her (<font color='blue'><b>Amy</b></font>)
gloves for her (<font color='blue'><b>Amy</b></font>), and asked if his (<font color='blue'><b>Laurie</b></font>) tie was straight, just as he (<font color='blue'><b>Laurie</b></font>) used to
do when they went to parties together at home.

<p/>The company assembled in the long salle a manger, that evening, was
such as one sees nowhere but on the Continent. The hospitable
Americans had invited every acquaintance they had in Nice, and having
no prejudice against titles, secured a few to add luster to their
Christmas ball.

<p/>A Russian prince condescended to sit in a corner for an hour and talk
with a massive lady, dressed like Hamlet's mother in black velvet with
a pearl bridle under her (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) chin. A Polish count, aged eighteen, devoted
himself to the ladies, who pronounced him (<font color='blue'><b>prince</b></font>), 'a fascinating dear', and a
German Serene Something, having come to supper alone, roamed vaguely
about, seeking what he (<font color='blue'><b>prince</b></font>) might devour. Baron Rothschild's private
secretary, a large-nosed Jew in tight boots, affably beamed upon the
world, as if his (<font color='blue'><b>Jew</b></font>) master's name crowned him (<font color='blue'><b>Jew</b></font>) with a golden halo. A stout
Frenchman, who knew the Emperor, came to indulge his (<font color='blue'><b>Emperor</b></font>) mania for dancing,
and Lady de Jones, a British matron, adorned the scene with her (<font color='blue'><b>Jones</b></font>) little
family of eight. Of course, there were many light-footed,
shrill-voiced American girls, handsome, lifeless-looking English ditto,
and a few plain but piquante French demoiselles, likewise the usual set
of traveling young gentlemen who disported themselves gaily, while
mammas of all nations lined the walls and smiled upon them benignly
when they danced with their daughters.

<p/>Any young girl can imagine Amy's state of mind when she (<font color='blue'><b>Amy</b></font>) `took the
stage' that night, leaning on Laurie's arm. She (<font color='blue'><b>Amy</b></font>) knew she (<font color='blue'><b>Amy</b></font>) looked well,
she (<font color='blue'><b>Amy</b></font>) loved to dance, she (<font color='blue'><b>Amy</b></font>) felt that her (<font color='blue'><b>Amy</b></font>) foot was on her (<font color='blue'><b>Amy</b></font>) native heath in a
ballroom, and enjoyed the delightful sense of power which comes when
young girls first discover the new and lovely kingdom they are born to
rule by virtue of beauty, youth, and womanhood. She (<font color='blue'><b>Amy</b></font>) did pity the Davis
girls, who were awkward, plain, and destitute of escort, except a grim
papa and three grimmer maiden aunts, and she (<font color='blue'><b>Amy</b></font>) bowed to them in her (<font color='blue'><b>Amy</b></font>)
friendliest manner as she (<font color='blue'><b>Amy</b></font>) passed, which was good of her (<font color='blue'><b>Amy</b></font>), as it
permitted them to see her (<font color='blue'><b>Amy</b></font>) dress, and burn with curiosity to know who
her (<font color='blue'><b>Amy</b></font>) distinguished-looking friend might be. With the first burst of the
band, Amy's color rose, her (<font color='blue'><b>Amy</b></font>) eyes began to sparkle, and her (<font color='blue'><b>Amy</b></font>) feet to tap
the floor impatiently, for she (<font color='blue'><b>Amy</b></font>) danced well and wanted Laurie to know
it. Therefore the shock she (<font color='blue'><b>Amy</b></font>) received can better be imagined than
described, when he (<font color='blue'><b>Laurie</b></font>) said in a perfectly tranquil tone, <div class="bookquote">``Do you care to
dance?''

 (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``One usually does at a ball.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Laurie/Mr. Laurie/LAURIE</b></font>)</div><p/>Her (<font color='blue'><b>Amy</b></font>) amazed look and quick answer caused Laurie to repair his (<font color='blue'><b>Laurie</b></font>) error as
fast as possible.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``I meant the first dance. May I have the honor?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I can give you one if I put off the Count. He (<font color='blue'><b>I</b></font>) dances divinely, but he (<font color='blue'><b>I</b></font>)
will excuse me, as you are an old friend,''  (<font color='red'><b>Amy/Amy March</b></font>)</div>said Amy, hoping that the
name would have a good effect, and show Laurie that she (<font color='blue'><b>Amy</b></font>) was not to be
trifled with.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Nice little boy, but rather a short Pole to support...

<p/>A daughter of the gods,
Devinely tall, and most divinely fair,''

 (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div><p/>was all the satisfaction she (<font color='blue'><b>Amy</b></font>) got, however.

<p/>The set in which they found themselves was composed of English, and Amy
was compelled to walk decorously through a cotillion, feeling all the
while as if she (<font color='blue'><b>Amy</b></font>) could dance the tarantella with relish. Laurie
resigned her (<font color='blue'><b>Amy</b></font>) to the `nice little boy', and went to do his (<font color='blue'><b>Laurie</b></font>) duty to Flo,
without securing Amy for the joys to come, which reprehensible want of
forethought was properly punished, for she (<font color='blue'><b>Amy</b></font>) immediately engaged herself
till supper, meaning to relent if he (<font color='blue'><b>Laurie</b></font>) then gave any signs penitence. She (<font color='blue'><b>Amy</b></font>)
showed him (<font color='blue'><b>Laurie</b></font>) her (<font color='blue'><b>Amy</b></font>) ball book with demure satisfaction when he (<font color='blue'><b>Laurie</b></font>) strolled
instead of rushed up to claim her (<font color='blue'><b>Amy</b></font>) for the next, a glorious polka
redowa. But his (<font color='blue'><b>Laurie</b></font>) polite regrets didn't impose upon her (<font color='blue'><b>Amy</b></font>), and when she (<font color='blue'><b>Amy</b></font>)
galloped away with the Count, she (<font color='blue'><b>Amy</b></font>) saw Laurie sit down by her (<font color='blue'><b>Amy</b></font>) aunt with
an actual expression of relief.

<p/>That was unpardonable, and Amy took no more notice of him (<font color='blue'><b>Laurie</b></font>) for a long
while, except a word now and then when she (<font color='blue'><b>Amy</b></font>) came to her (<font color='blue'><b>Amy</b></font>) chaperon between
the dances for a necessary pin or a moment's rest. Her (<font color='blue'><b>Amy</b></font>) anger had a
good effect, however, for she (<font color='blue'><b>Amy</b></font>) hid it under a smiling face, and seemed
unusually blithe and brilliant. Laurie's eyes followed her (<font color='blue'><b>Amy</b></font>) with
pleasure, for she (<font color='blue'><b>Amy</b></font>) neither romped nor sauntered, but danced with spirit
and grace, making the delightsome pastime what it should be. He (<font color='blue'><b>Laurie</b></font>) very
naturally fell to studying her (<font color='blue'><b>Amy</b></font>) from this new point of view, and before
the evening was half over, had decided that `little Amy was going to
make a very charming woman'.

<p/>It was a lively scene, for soon the spirit of the social season took
possession of everyone, and Christmas merriment made all faces shine,
hearts happy, and heels light. The musicians fiddled, tooted, and
banged as if they enjoyed it, everybody danced who could, and those who
couldn't admired their neighbors with uncommon warmth. The air was
dark with Davises, and many Joneses gamboled like a flock of young
giraffes. The golden secretary darted through the room like a meteor
with a dashing French-woman who carpeted the floor with her (<font color='blue'><b>It</b></font>) pink satin
train. The serene Teuton found the supper-table and was happy, eating
steadily through the bill of fare, and dismayed the garcons by the
ravages he (<font color='blue'><b>secretary</b></font>) committed. But the Emperor's friend covered himself with
glory, for he (<font color='blue'><b>friend</b></font>) danced everything, whether he (<font color='blue'><b>friend</b></font>) knew it or not, and
introduced impromptu pirouettes when the figures bewildered him (<font color='blue'><b>friend</b></font>). The
boyish abandon of that stout man was charming to behold, for though he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>)
`carried weight', he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) danced like an India-rubber ball. He (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) ran, he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>)
flew, he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) pranced, his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) face glowed, his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) bald head shown, his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) coattails
waved wildly, his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) pumps actually twinkled in the air, and when the
music stopped, he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) wiped the drops from his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) brow, and beamed upon his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>)
fellow men like a French Pickwick without glasses.

<p/>Amy and her (<font color='blue'><b>Amy</b></font>) Pole distinguished themselves by equal enthusiasm but more
graceful agility, and Laurie found himself involuntarily keeping time
to the rhythmic rise and fall of the white slippers as they flew by as
indefatigably as if winged. When little Vladimir finally relinquished
her (<font color='blue'><b>Amy</b></font>), with assurances that he (<font color='blue'><b>Vladimir</b></font>) was `desolated to leave so early', she (<font color='blue'><b>Amy</b></font>) was
ready to rest, and see how her (<font color='blue'><b>Amy</b></font>) recreant knight had borne his (<font color='blue'><b>knight</b></font>) punishment.

<p/>It had been successful, for at three-and-twenty, blighted affections
find a balm in friendly society, and young nerves will thrill, young
blood dance, and healthy young spirits rise, when subjected to the
enchantment of beauty, light, music, and motion. Laurie had a waked-up
look as he (<font color='blue'><b>Laurie</b></font>) rose to give her (<font color='blue'><b>Amy</b></font>) his (<font color='blue'><b>Laurie</b></font>) seat, and when he (<font color='blue'><b>Laurie</b></font>) hurried away to bring
her (<font color='blue'><b>Amy</b></font>) some supper, she (<font color='blue'><b>Amy</b></font>) said to herself, with a satisfied smile, <div class="bookquote">``Ah, I
thought that would do him (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>) good!''

 (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``You look like Balzac's '_Femme Peinte Par Elle-Meme_',''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Laurie</b></font>) said, as he (<font color='blue'><b>Laurie</b></font>)
fanned her (<font color='blue'><b>Amy</b></font>) with one hand and held her (<font color='blue'><b>Amy</b></font>) coffee cup in the other.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``My rouge won't come off.''  (<font color='red'><b>Amy/Amy March</b></font>)</div>and Amy rubbed her (<font color='blue'><b>Amy</b></font>) brilliant cheek, and
showed him (<font color='blue'><b>Laurie</b></font>) her (<font color='blue'><b>Amy</b></font>) white glove with a sober simplicity that made him (<font color='blue'><b>Laurie</b></font>) laugh
outright.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``What do you call this stuff?''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Laurie</b></font>) asked, touching a fold of her (<font color='blue'><b>Amy</b></font>) dress
that had blown over his (<font color='blue'><b>Laurie</b></font>) knee.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Illusion.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Good name for it. It's very pretty--new thing, isn't it?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``It's as old as the hills. You have seen it on dozens of girls, and
you never found out that it was pretty till now--stupide!''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I never saw it on you before, which accounts for the mistake, you see.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``None of that, it is forbidden. I'd rather take coffee than
compliments just now. No, don't lounge, it makes me nervous.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Laurie/Mr. Laurie/LAURIE</b></font>)</div><p/>Laurie sat bold upright, and meekly took her (<font color='blue'><b>Amy</b></font>) empty plate feeling an odd
sort of pleasure in having `little Amy' order him (<font color='blue'><b>Laurie</b></font>) about, for she (<font color='blue'><b>Amy</b></font>) had
lost her (<font color='blue'><b>Amy</b></font>) shyness now, and felt an irrestible desire to trample on him (<font color='blue'><b>Laurie</b></font>),
as girls have a delightful way of doing when lords of creation show any
signs of subjection.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Where did you learn all this sort of thing?''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Laurie</b></font>) asked with a quizzical
look.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``As `this sort of thing' is rather a vague expression, would you kindly
explain?''  (<font color='red'><b>Amy/Amy March</b></font>)</div>returned Amy, knowing perfectly well what he (<font color='blue'><b>Laurie</b></font>) meant, but
wickedly leaving him (<font color='blue'><b>Laurie</b></font>) to describe what is indescribable.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Well--the general air, the style, the self-possession,
the--the--illusion--you know'' (<font color='red'><b>Laurie/Mr. Laurie/LAURIE</b></font>)</div>, laughed Laurie, breaking down and
helping himself out of his (<font color='blue'><b>Laurie</b></font>) quandary with the new word.

<p/>Amy was gratified, but of course didn't show it, and demurely answered,
<div class="bookquote">``Foreign life polishes one in spite of one's self. I study as well as
play, and as for this'' (<font color='red'><b>Amy/Amy March</b></font>)</div>--with a little gesture toward her (<font color='blue'><b>Amy</b></font>) dress--<div class="bookquote">``why,
tulle is cheap, posies to be had for nothing, and I am used to making
the most of my poor little things.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Amy/Amy March</b></font>)</div><p/>Amy rather regretted that last sentence, fearing it wasn't in good
taste, but Laurie liked her (<font color='blue'><b>Amy</b></font>) better for it, and found himself both
admiring and respecting the brave patience that made the most of
opportunity, and the cheerful spirit that covered poverty with flowers.
Amy did not know why he (<font color='blue'><b>Laurie</b></font>) looked at her (<font color='blue'><b>Amy</b></font>) so kindly, nor why he (<font color='blue'><b>Laurie</b></font>) filled up
her (<font color='blue'><b>Amy</b></font>) book with his (<font color='blue'><b>Laurie</b></font>) own name, and devoted himself to her (<font color='blue'><b>Amy</b></font>) for the rest of
the evening in the most delightful manner; but the impulse that wrought
this agreeable change was the result of one of the new impressions
which both of them were unconsciously giving and receiving.



<p/>CHAPTER THIRTY-EIGHT

<p/>ON THE SHELF

<p/>In France the young girls have a dull time of it till they are married,
when <div class="bookquote">``Vive la liberte!''  (<font color='red'><b>the girls</b></font>)</div>becomes their motto. In America, as everyone
knows, girls early sign the declaration of independence, and enjoy
their freedom with republican zest, but the young matrons usually
abdicate with the first heir to the throne and go into a seclusion
almost as close as a French nunnery, though by no means as quiet.
Whether they like it or not, they are virtually put upon the shelf as
soon as the wedding excitement is over, and most of them might exclaim,
as did a very pretty woman the other day, <div class="bookquote">``I'm as handsome as ever, but
no one takes any notice of me because I'm married.''

 (<font color='red'><b>a woman day</b></font>)</div><p/>Not being a belle or even a fashionable lady, Meg did not experience
this affliction till her (<font color='blue'><b>Meg</b></font>) babies were a year old, for in her (<font color='blue'><b>Meg</b></font>) little
world primitive customs prevailed, and she (<font color='blue'><b>Meg</b></font>) found herself more admired
and beloved than ever.

<p/>As she (<font color='blue'><b>Meg</b></font>) was a womanly little woman, the maternal instinct was very
strong, and she (<font color='blue'><b>Meg</b></font>) was entirely absorbed in her (<font color='blue'><b>Meg</b></font>) children, to the utter
exclusion of everything and everybody else. Day and night she (<font color='blue'><b>Meg</b></font>) brooded
over them with tireless devotion and anxiety, leaving John to the
tender mercies of the help, for an Irish lady now presided over the
kitchen department. Being a domestic man, John decidedly missed the
wifely attentions he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) had been accustomed to receive, but as he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) adored
his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) babies, he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) cheerfully relinquished his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) comfort for a time,
supposing with masculine ignorance that peace would soon be restored.
But three months passed, and there was no return of repose. Meg looked
worn and nervous, the babies absorbed every minute of her (<font color='blue'><b>Meg</b></font>) time, the
house was neglected, and Kitty, the cook, who took life `aisy', kept
him (<font color='blue'><b>cook</b></font>) on short commons. When he (<font color='blue'><b>cook</b></font>) went out in the morning he (<font color='blue'><b>cook</b></font>) was
bewildered by small commissions for the captive mamma, if he (<font color='blue'><b>cook</b></font>) came gaily
in at night, eager to embrace his (<font color='blue'><b>cook</b></font>) family, he (<font color='blue'><b>cook</b></font>) was quenched by a <div class="bookquote">``Hush!
They are just asleep after worrying all day.''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>If he (<font color='blue'><b>cook</b></font>) proposed a little
amusement at home, <div class="bookquote">``No, it would disturb the babies.''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>If he (<font color='blue'><b>cook</b></font>) hinted at
a lecture or a concert, he (<font color='blue'><b>cook</b></font>) was answered with a reproachful look, and a
decided--<div class="bookquote">``Leave my children for pleasure, never!''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>His (<font color='blue'><b>cook</b></font>) sleep was broken
by infant wails and visions of a phantom figure pacing noiselessly to
and fro in the watches of the night. His (<font color='blue'><b>cook</b></font>) meals were interrupted by the
frequent flight of the presiding genius, who deserted him (<font color='blue'><b>cook</b></font>), half-helped,
if a muffled chirp sounded from the nest above. And when he (<font color='blue'><b>cook</b></font>) read his (<font color='blue'><b>cook</b></font>)
paper of an evening, Demi's colic got into the shipping list and
Daisy's fall affected the price of stocks, for Mrs. Brooke was only
interested in domestic news.

<p/>The poor man was very uncomfortable, for the children had bereft him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) of
his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) wife, home was merely a nursery and the perpetual `hushing' made
him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) feel like a brutal intruder whenever he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) entered the sacred
precincts of Babyland. He (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) bore it very patiently for six months, and
when no signs of amendment appeared, he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) did what other paternal exiles
do--tried to get a little comfort elsewhere. Scott had married and
gone to housekeeping not far off, and John fell into the way of running
over for an hour or two of an evening, when his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) own parlor was empty,
and his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) own wife singing lullabies that seemed to have no end. Mrs.
Scott was a lively, pretty girl, with nothing to do but be agreeable,
and she (<font color='blue'><b>Scott</b></font>) performed her (<font color='blue'><b>Scott</b></font>) mission most successfully. The parlor was always
bright and attractive, the chessboard ready, the piano in tune, plenty
of gay gossip, and a nice little supper set forth in tempting style.

<p/>John would have preferred his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) own fireside if it had not been so
lonely, but as it was he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) gratefully took the next best thing and
enjoyed his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) neighbor's society.

<p/>Meg rather approved of the new arrangement at first, and found it a
relief to know that John was having a good time instead of dozing in
the parlor, or tramping about the house and waking the children. But
by-and-by, when the teething worry was over and the idols went to sleep
at proper hours, leaving Mamma time to rest, she (<font color='blue'><b>John</b></font>) began to miss John,
and find her (<font color='blue'><b>John</b></font>) workbasket dull company, when he (<font color='blue'><b>John</b></font>) was not sitting opposite
in his (<font color='blue'><b>John</b></font>) old dressing gown, comfortably scorching his (<font color='blue'><b>John</b></font>) slippers on the
fender. She (<font color='blue'><b>John</b></font>) would not ask him (<font color='blue'><b>John</b></font>) to stay at home, but felt injured
because he (<font color='blue'><b>John</b></font>) did not know that she (<font color='blue'><b>John</b></font>) wanted him (<font color='blue'><b>John</b></font>) without being told,
entirely forgetting the many evenings he (<font color='blue'><b>John</b></font>) had waited for her (<font color='blue'><b>John</b></font>) in vain.
She (<font color='blue'><b>John</b></font>) was nervous and worn out with watching and worry, and in that
unreasonable frame of mind which the best of mothers occasionally
experience when domestic cares oppress them. Want of exercise robs
them of cheerfulness, and too much devotion to that idol of American
women, the teapot, makes them feel as if they were all nerve and no
muscle.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Yes,''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>John</b></font>) would say, looking in the glass, <div class="bookquote">``I'm getting old and ugly.
John doesn't find me interesting any longer, so he (<font color='blue'><b>me</b></font>) leaves his (<font color='blue'><b>me</b></font>) faded
wife and goes to see his (<font color='blue'><b>me</b></font>) pretty neighbor, who has no incumbrances.
Well, the babies love me, they don't care if I am thin and pale and
haven't time to crimp my hair, they are my comfort, and some day John
will see what I've gladly sacrificed for them, won't he (<font color='blue'><b>me</b></font>), my precious?''

 (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div><p/>To which pathetic appeal Daisy would answer with a coo, or Demi with a
crow, and Meg would put by her (<font color='blue'><b>Meg</b></font>) lamentations for a maternal revel, which
soothed her (<font color='blue'><b>Meg</b></font>) solitude for the time being. But the pain increased as
politics absorbed John, who was always running over to discuss
interesting points with Scott, quite unconscious that Meg missed him (<font color='blue'><b>Meg</b></font>).
Not a word did she (<font color='blue'><b>Meg</b></font>) say, however, till her (<font color='blue'><b>Meg</b></font>) mother found her (<font color='blue'><b>Meg</b></font>) in tears one
day, and insisted on knowing what the matter was, for Meg's drooping
spirits had not escaped her (<font color='blue'><b>Meg</b></font>) observation.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``I wouldn't tell anyone except you, Mother, but I really do need
advice, for if John goes on much longer I might as well be widowed,''
 (<font color='red'><b>John/Mrs. Brooke/John Brooke</b></font>)</div>replied Mrs. Brooke, drying her (<font color='blue'><b>Brooke</b></font>) tears on Daisy's bib with an injured
air.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Goes on how, my dear?''  (<font color='red'><b>mother</b></font>)</div>asked her (<font color='blue'><b>Brooke</b></font>) mother anxiously.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``He (<font color='blue'><b>me</b></font>)'s away all day, and at night when I want to see him (<font color='blue'><b>me</b></font>), he (<font color='blue'><b>me</b></font>) is
continually going over to the Scotts'. It isn't fair that I should
have the hardest work, and never any amusement. Men are very selfish,
even the best of them.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``So are women. Don't blame John till you see where you are wrong
yourself.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``But it can't be right for him (<font color='blue'><b>me</b></font>) to neglect me.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Don't you neglect him (<font color='blue'><b>me</b></font>)?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Why, Mother, I thought you'd take my part!''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``So I do, as far as sympathizing goes, but I think the fault is yours,
Meg.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I don't see how.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Let me show you. Did John ever neglect you, as you call it, while you
made it a point to give him (<font color='blue'><b>me</b></font>) your society of an evening, his (<font color='blue'><b>me</b></font>) only
leisure time?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``No, but I can't do it now, with two babies to tend.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I think you could, dear, and I think you ought. May I speak quite
freely, and will you remember that it's Mother who blames as well as
Mother who sympathizes?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Indeed I will! Speak to me as if I were little Meg again. I often
feel as if I needed teaching more than ever since these babies look to
me for everything.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Meg</b></font>)</div><p/>Meg drew her (<font color='blue'><b>Meg</b></font>) low chair beside her (<font color='blue'><b>Meg</b></font>) mother's, and with a little
interruption in either lap, the two women rocked and talked lovingly
together, feeling that the tie of motherhood made them more one than
ever.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``You have only made the mistake that most young wives make--forgotten
your duty to your husband in your love for your children. A very
natural and forgivable mistake, Meg, but one that had better be
remedied before you take to different ways, for children should draw
you nearer than ever, not separate you, as if they were all yours, and
John had nothing to do but support them. I've seen it for some weeks,
but have not spoken, feeling sure it would come right in time.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I'm afraid it won't. If I ask him (<font color='blue'><b>husband</b></font>) to stay, he (<font color='blue'><b>husband</b></font>)'ll think I'm jealous,
and I wouldn't insult him (<font color='blue'><b>husband</b></font>) by such an idea. He (<font color='blue'><b>husband</b></font>) doesn't see that I want
him (<font color='blue'><b>husband</b></font>), and I don't know how to tell him (<font color='blue'><b>husband</b></font>) without words.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Make it so pleasant he (<font color='blue'><b>husband</b></font>) won't want to go away. My dear, he (<font color='blue'><b>husband</b></font>)'s longing
for his (<font color='blue'><b>husband</b></font>) little home, but it isn't home without you, and you are always
in the nursery.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Oughtn't I to be there?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Not all the time, too much confinement makes you nervous, and then you
are unfitted for everything. Besides, you owe something to John as
well as to the babies. Don't neglect husband for children, don't shut
him (<font color='blue'><b>husband</b></font>) out of the nursery, but teach him (<font color='blue'><b>husband</b></font>) how to help in it. His (<font color='blue'><b>husband</b></font>) place is
there as well as yours, and the children need him (<font color='blue'><b>husband</b></font>). Let him (<font color='blue'><b>husband</b></font>) feel that
he (<font color='blue'><b>husband</b></font>) has a part to do, and he (<font color='blue'><b>husband</b></font>) will do it gladly and faithfully, and it
will be better for you all.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``You really think so, Mother?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I know it, Meg, for I've tried it, and I seldom give advice unless
I've proved its practicability. When you and Jo were little, I went on
just as you are, feeling as if I didn't do my duty unless I devoted
myself wholly to you. Poor Father took to his (<font color='blue'><b>Father</b></font>) books, after I had
refused all offers of help, and left me to try my experiment alone. I
struggled along as well as I could, but Jo was too much for me. I
nearly spoiled her (<font color='blue'><b>Jo</b></font>) by indulgence. You were poorly, and I worried about
you till I fell sick myself. Then Father came to the rescue, quietly
managed everything, and made himself so helpful that I saw my mistake,
and never have been able to get on without him (<font color='blue'><b>Father</b></font>) since. That is the
secret of our home happiness. He (<font color='blue'><b>Father</b></font>) does not let business wean him (<font color='blue'><b>Father</b></font>) from
the little cares and duties that affect us all, and I try not to let
domestic worries destroy my interest in his (<font color='blue'><b>Father</b></font>) pursuits. Each do our part
alone in many things, but at home we work together, always.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``It is so, Mother, and my great wish is to be to my husband and
children what you have been to yours. Show me how, I'll do anything
you say.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``You always were my docile daughter. Well, dear, if I were you, I'd
let John have more to do with the management of Demi, for the boy needs
training, and it's none too soon to begin. Then I'd do what I have
often proposed, let Hannah come and help you. She (<font color='blue'><b>Hannah</b></font>) is a capital nurse,
and you may trust the precious babies to her (<font color='blue'><b>Hannah</b></font>) while you do more
housework. You need the exercise, Hannah would enjoy the rest, and
John would find his (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>) wife again. Go out more, keep cheerful as well as
busy, for you are the sunshine-maker of the family, and if you get
dismal there is no fair weather. Then I'd try to take an interest in
whatever John likes--talk with him (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>), let him (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>) read to you, exchange
ideas, and help each other in that way. Don't shut yourself up in a
bandbox because you are a woman, but understand what is going on, and
educate yourself to take your part in the world's work, for it all
affects you and yours.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``John is so sensible, I'm afraid he (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>) will think I'm stupid if I ask
questions about politics and things.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I don't believe he (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>) would. Love covers a multitude of sins, and of

doesn't find your society far more agreeable than Mrs. Scott's suppers.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I will. Poor John! I'm afraid I have neglected him (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>) sadly, but I

This is just the time, Meg, when young married people are apt to grow
apart, and the very time when they ought to be most together, for the
first tenderness soon wears off, unless care is taken to preserve it.
And no time is so beautiful and precious to parents as the first years
of the little lives given to them to train. Don't let John be a
stranger to the babies, for they will do more to keep him (<font color='blue'><b>stranger</b></font>) safe and
happy in this world of trial and temptation than anything else, and
through them you will learn to know and love one another as you should.
Now, dear, good-by. Think over Mother's preachment, act upon it if it
seems good, and God bless you all.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Meg</b></font>)</div><p/>Meg did think it over, found it good, and acted upon it, though the
first attempt was not made exactly as she (<font color='blue'><b>Meg</b></font>) planned to have it. Of
course the children tyrannized over her (<font color='blue'><b>Meg</b></font>), and ruled the house as soon as
they found out that kicking and squalling brought them whatever they
wanted. Mamma was an abject slave to their caprices, but Papa was not
so easily subjugated, and occasionally afflicted his (<font color='blue'><b>slave</b></font>) tender spouse by
an attempt at paternal discipline with his (<font color='blue'><b>slave</b></font>) obstreperous son. For Demi
inherited a trifle of his (<font color='blue'><b>slave</b></font>) sire's firmness of character, we won't call
it obstinacy, and when he (<font color='blue'><b>slave</b></font>) made up his (<font color='blue'><b>slave</b></font>) little mind to have or to do
anything, all the king's horses and all the king's men could not change
that pertinacious little mind. Mamma thought the dear too young to be
taught to conquer his (<font color='blue'><b>king</b></font>) prejudices, but Papa believed that it never was
too soon to learn obedience. So Master Demi early discovered that when
he (<font color='blue'><b>Master</b></font>) undertook to `wrastle' with ``Parpar', he (<font color='blue'><b>God</b></font>) always got the worst of it,
yet like the Englishman, baby respected the man who conquered him (<font color='blue'><b>Englishman</b></font>), and
loved the father whose grave <div class="bookquote">``No, no,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>was more impressive than all
Mamma's love pats.

<p/>A few days after the talk with her (<font color='blue'><b>Demi</b></font>) mother, Meg resolved to try a social
evening with John, so she (<font color='blue'><b>John</b></font>) ordered a nice supper, set the parlor in
order, dressed herself prettily, and put the children to bed early,
that nothing should interfere with her (<font color='blue'><b>John</b></font>) experiment. But unfortunately
Demi's most unconquerable prejudice was against going to bed, and that
night he (<font color='blue'><b>Master</b></font>) decided to go on a rampage. So poor Meg sang and rocked, told
stories and tried every sleep-prevoking wile she (<font color='blue'><b>Meg</b></font>) could devise, but all
in vain, the big eyes wouldn't shut, and long after Daisy had gone to
byelow, like the chubby little bunch of good nature she (<font color='blue'><b>Daisy</b></font>) was, naughty
Demi lay staring at the light, with the most discouragingly wide-awake
expression of countenance.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Will Demi lie still like a good boy, while Mamma runs down and gives
poor Papa his (<font color='blue'><b>Papa</b></font>) tea?''  (<font color='red'><b>Meg</b></font>)</div>asked Meg, as the hall door softly closed, and the
well-known step went tip-toeing into the dining room.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Me has tea!''  (<font color='red'><b>Demi</b></font>)</div>said Demi, preparing to join in the revel.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``No, but I'll save you some little cakies for breakfast, if you'll go
bye-bye like Daisy. Will you, lovey?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Iss!''  (<font color='red'><b>Demi</b></font>)</div>and Demi shut his (<font color='blue'><b>Meg</b></font>) eyes tight, as if to catch sleep and hurry the
desired day.

<p/>Taking advantage of the propitious moment, Meg slipped away and ran
down to greet her (<font color='blue'><b>Meg</b></font>) husband with a smiling face and the little blue bow
in her (<font color='blue'><b>Meg</b></font>) hair which was his (<font color='blue'><b>husband</b></font>) especial admiration. He (<font color='blue'><b>husband</b></font>) saw it at once and
said with pleased surprise, <div class="bookquote">``Why, little mother, how gay we are
tonight. Do you expect company?''

 (<font color='red'><b>He</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Only you, dear.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Is it a birthday, anniversary, or anything?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``No, I'm tired of being dowdy, so I dressed up as a change. You always
make yourself nice for table, no matter how tired you are, so why
shouldn't I when I have the time?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I do it out of respect for you, my dear,''  (<font color='red'><b>John/Mrs. Brooke/John Brooke</b></font>)</div>said old-fashioned John.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Ditto, ditto, Mr. Brooke,''  (<font color='red'><b>Meg</b></font>)</div>laughed Meg, looking young and pretty
again, as she (<font color='blue'><b>Meg</b></font>) nodded to him (<font color='blue'><b>husband</b></font>) over the teapot.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Well, it's altogether delightful, and like old times. This tastes
right. I drink your health, dear.''  (<font color='red'><b>John/Mrs. Brooke/John Brooke</b></font>)</div>and John sipped his (<font color='blue'><b>husband</b></font>) tea with an air
of reposeful rapture, which was of very short duration however, for as
he (<font color='blue'><b>husband</b></font>) put down his (<font color='blue'><b>husband</b></font>) cup, the door handle rattled mysteriously, and a little
voice was heard, saying impatiently...

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Opy doy. Me's tummin!''

 (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``It's that naughty boy. I told him (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>) to go to sleep alone, and here he (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>)
is, downstairs, getting his (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>) death a-cold pattering over that canvas,''
 (<font color='red'><b>Meg</b></font>)</div>said Meg, answering the call.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Mornin' now,''  (<font color='red'><b>Demi</b></font>)</div>announced Demi in joyful tone as he (<font color='blue'><b>husband</b></font>) entered, with his (<font color='blue'><b>husband</b></font>)
long nightgown gracefully festooned over his (<font color='blue'><b>husband</b></font>) arm and every curl bobbing
gayly as he (<font color='blue'><b>husband</b></font>) pranced about the table, eyeing the `cakies' with loving
glances.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``No, it isn't morning yet. You must go to bed, and not trouble poor
Mamma. Then you can have the little cake with sugar on it.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Me loves Parpar,''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>said the artful one, preparing to climb the paternal
knee and revel in forbidden joys. But John shook his (<font color='blue'><b>husband</b></font>) head, and said to
Meg...

<p/><div class="bookquote">``If you told him (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>) to stay up there, and go to sleep alone, make him (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>) do
it, or he (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>) will never learn to mind you.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Meg</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Yes, of course. Come, Demi,''  (<font color='red'><b>Meg</b></font>)</div>and Meg led her (<font color='blue'><b>Meg</b></font>) son away, feeling a
strong desire to spank the little marplot who hopped beside her (<font color='blue'><b>Meg</b></font>),
laboring under the delusion that the bribe was to be administered as
soon as they reached the nursery.

<p/>Nor was he (<font color='blue'><b>husband</b></font>) disappointed, for that shortsighted woman actually gave him (<font color='blue'><b>husband</b></font>)
a lump of sugar, tucked him (<font color='blue'><b>husband</b></font>) into his (<font color='blue'><b>husband</b></font>) bed, and forbade any more
promenades till morning.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Iss!''  (<font color='red'><b>Demi</b></font>)</div>said Demi the perjured, blissfully sucking his (<font color='blue'><b>husband</b></font>) sugar, and
regarding his (<font color='blue'><b>husband</b></font>) first attempt as eminently successful.

<p/>Meg returned to her (<font color='blue'><b>Meg</b></font>) place, and supper was progressing pleasantly, when
the little ghost walked again, and exposed the maternal delinquencies
by boldly demanding, <div class="bookquote">``More sudar, Marmar.''

 (<font color='red'><b>the ghost</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Now this won't do,''  (<font color='red'><b>John/Mrs. Brooke/John Brooke</b></font>)</div>said John, hardening his (<font color='blue'><b>husband</b></font>) heart against the
engaging little sinner. <div class="bookquote">``We shall never know any peace till that child

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``He (<font color='blue'><b>slave</b></font>) won't stay there, he (<font color='blue'><b>slave</b></font>) never does unless I sit by him (<font color='blue'><b>slave</b></font>).''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I'll manage him (<font color='blue'><b>slave</b></font>). Demi, go upstairs, and get into your bed, as Mamma
bids you.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``S'ant!''  (<font color='red'><b>the rebel</b></font>)</div>replied the young rebel, helping himself to the coveted
`cakie', and beginning to eat the same with calm audacity.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``You must never say that to Papa. I shall carry you if you don't go
yourself.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Go `way, me don't love Parpar.''  (<font color='red'><b>Demi</b></font>)</div>and Demi retired to his (<font color='blue'><b>husband</b></font>) mother's
skirts for protection.

<p/>But even that refuge proved unavailing, for he (<font color='blue'><b>husband</b></font>) was delivered over to
the enemy, with a <div class="bookquote">``Be gentle with him (<font color='blue'><b>Papa</b></font>), John,''  (<font color='red'><b>the enemy</b></font>)</div>which struck the culprit
with dismay, for when Mamma deserted him (<font color='blue'><b>husband</b></font>), then the judgment day was at
hand. Bereft of his (<font color='blue'><b>husband</b></font>) cake, defrauded of his (<font color='blue'><b>husband</b></font>) frolic, and borne away by a
strong hand to that detested bed, poor Demi could not restrain his (<font color='blue'><b>husband</b></font>)
wrath, but openly defied Papa, and kicked and screamed lustily all the
way upstairs. The minute he (<font color='blue'><b>husband</b></font>) was put into bed on one side, he (<font color='blue'><b>husband</b></font>) rolled
out on the other, and made for the door, only to be ignominiously
caught up by the tail of his (<font color='blue'><b>husband</b></font>) little toga and put back again, which
lively performance was kept up till the young man's strength gave out,
when he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) devoted himself to roaring at the top of his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) voice. This vocal
exercise usually conquered Meg, but John sat as unmoved as the post
which is popularly believed to be deaf. No coaxing, no sugar, no
lullaby, no story, even the light was put out and only the red glow of
the fire enlivened the `big dark' which Demi regarded with curiosity
rather than fear. This new order of things disgusted him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>), and he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>)
howled dismally for ``Marmar', as his (<font color='blue'><b>Papa</b></font>) angry passions subsided, and
recollections of his (<font color='blue'><b>Papa</b></font>) tender bondwoman returned to the captive autocrat.
The plaintive wail which succeeded the passionate roar went to Meg's
heart, and she (<font color='blue'><b>Meg</b></font>) ran up to say beseechingly...

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Let me stay with him (<font color='blue'><b>Papa</b></font>), he (<font color='blue'><b>Papa</b></font>)'ll be good now, John.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``No, my dear. I've told him (<font color='blue'><b>Papa</b></font>) he (<font color='blue'><b>Papa</b></font>) must go to sleep, as you bid him (<font color='blue'><b>Papa</b></font>), and
he (<font color='blue'><b>Papa</b></font>) must, if I stay here all night.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``But he (<font color='blue'><b>Papa</b></font>)'ll cry himself sick,''  (<font color='red'><b>Meg</b></font>)</div>pleaded Meg, reproaching herself for
deserting her (<font color='blue'><b>Meg</b></font>) boy.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``No, he (<font color='blue'><b>Papa</b></font>) won't, he (<font color='blue'><b>Papa</b></font>)'s so tired he (<font color='blue'><b>Papa</b></font>) will soon drop off and then the matter
is settled, for he (<font color='blue'><b>Papa</b></font>) will understand that he (<font color='blue'><b>Papa</b></font>) has got to mind. Don't
interfere, I'll manage him (<font color='blue'><b>Papa</b></font>).''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``He (<font color='blue'><b>Papa</b></font>)'s my child, and I can't have his (<font color='blue'><b>Papa</b></font>) spirit broken by harshness.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``He (<font color='blue'><b>Papa</b></font>)'s my child, and I won't have his (<font color='blue'><b>Papa</b></font>) temper spoiled by indulgence. Go
down, my dear, and leave the boy to me.''

 (<font color='red'><b>John/Mrs. Brooke/John Brooke</b></font>)</div><p/>When John spoke in that masterful tone, Meg always obeyed, and never
regretted her (<font color='blue'><b>Meg</b></font>) docility.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Please let me kiss him (<font color='blue'><b>Papa</b></font>) once, John?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Certainly. Demi, say good night to Mamma, and let her (<font color='blue'><b>Demi</b></font>) go and rest,
for she (<font color='blue'><b>Demi</b></font>) is very tired with taking care of you all day.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Meg</b></font>)</div><p/>Meg always insisted upon it that the kiss won the victory, for after it
was given, Demi sobbed more quietly, and lay quite still at the bottom
of the bed, whither he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) had wriggled in his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) anguish of mind.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Poor little man, he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>)'s worn out with sleep and crying. I'll cover him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>)
up, and then go and set Meg's heart at rest,''  (<font color='red'><b>John/Mrs. Brooke/John Brooke</b></font>)</div>thought John, creeping to
the bedside, hoping to find his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) rebellious heir asleep.

<p/>But he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) wasn't, for the moment his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) father peeped at him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>), Demi's eyes
opened, his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) little chin began to quiver, and he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) put up his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) arms, saying
with a penitent hiccough, <div class="bookquote">``Me's dood, now.''

 (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div><p/>Sitting on the stairs outside Meg wondered at the long silence which
followed the uproar, and after imagining all sorts of impossible
accidents, she (<font color='blue'><b>Meg</b></font>) slipped into the room to set her (<font color='blue'><b>Meg</b></font>) fears at rest. Demi
lay fast asleep, not in his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) usual spreadeagle attitude, but in a
subdued bunch, cuddled close in the circle of his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) father's arm and
holding his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) father's finger, as if he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) felt that justice was tempered
with mercy, and had gone to sleep a sadder and wiser baby. So held,
John had waited with a womanly patience till the little hand relaxed
its hold, and while waiting had fallen asleep, more tired by that
tussle with his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) son than with his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) whole day's work.

<p/>As Meg stood watching the two faces on the pillow, she (<font color='blue'><b>Meg</b></font>) smiled to
herself, and then slipped away again, saying in a satisfied tone, <div class="bookquote">``I
never need fear that John will be too harsh with my babies. He (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) does
know how to manage them, and will be a great help, for Demi is getting
too much for me.''

 (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div><p/>When John came down at last, expecting to find a pensive or reproachful
wife, he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) was agreeably surprised to find Meg placidly trimming a
bonnet, and to be greeted with the request to read something about the
election, if he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) was not too tired. John saw in a minute that a
revolution of some kind was going on, but wisely asked no questions,
knowing that Meg was such a transparent little person, she (<font color='blue'><b>Meg</b></font>) couldn't
keep a secret to save her (<font color='blue'><b>Meg</b></font>) life, and therefore the clue would soon
appear. He (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) read a long debate with the most amiable readiness and then
explained it in his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) most lucid manner, while Meg tried to look deeply
interested, to ask intelligent questions, and keep her (<font color='blue'><b>Meg</b></font>) thoughts from
wandering from the state of the nation to the state of her (<font color='blue'><b>Meg</b></font>) bonnet. In
her (<font color='blue'><b>Meg</b></font>) secret soul, however, she (<font color='blue'><b>Meg</b></font>) decided that politics were as bad as
mathematics, and that the mission of politicians seemed to be calling
each other names, but she (<font color='blue'><b>Meg</b></font>) kept these feminine ideas to herself, and
when John paused, shook her (<font color='blue'><b>John</b></font>) head and said with what she (<font color='blue'><b>John</b></font>) thought
diplomatic ambiguity, <div class="bookquote">``Well, I really don't see what we are coming to.''

 (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div><p/>John laughed, and watched her (<font color='blue'><b>John</b></font>) for a minute, as she (<font color='blue'><b>John</b></font>) poised a pretty
little preparation of lace and flowers on her (<font color='blue'><b>John</b></font>) hand, and regarded it
with the genuine interest which his (<font color='blue'><b>John</b></font>) harangue had failed to waken.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``She (<font color='blue'><b>Demi</b></font>) is trying to like politics for my sake, so I'll try and like
millinery for hers, that's only fair,''  (<font color='red'><b>John/Mrs. Brooke/John Brooke</b></font>)</div>thought John the Just, adding
aloud, <div class="bookquote">``That's very pretty. Is it what you call a breakfast cap?''

 (<font color='red'><b>John/Mrs. Brooke/John Brooke</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``My dear man, it's a bonnet! My very best go-to-concert-and-theater
bonnet.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I beg your pardon, it was so small, I naturally mistook it for one of
the flyaway things you sometimes wear. How do you keep it on?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``These bits of lace are fastened under the chin with a rosebud, so,''
 (<font color='red'><b>Meg</b></font>)</div>and Meg illustrated by putting on the bonnet and regarding him (<font color='blue'><b>John</b></font>) with an
air of calm satisfaction that was irresistible.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``It's a love of a bonnet, but I prefer the face inside, for it looks
young and happy again,''  (<font color='red'><b>John/Mrs. Brooke/John Brooke</b></font>)</div>and John kissed the smiling face, to the great
detriment of the rosebud under the chin.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``I'm glad you like it, for I want you to take me to one of the new
concerts some night. I really need some music to put me in tune. Will
you, please?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Of course I will, with all my heart, or anywhere else you like. You
have been shut up so long, it will do you no end of good, and I shall
enjoy it, of all things. What put it into your head, little mother?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Well, I had a talk with Marmee the other day, and told her (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) how nervous
and cross and out of sorts I felt, and she (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) said I needed change and
less care, so Hannah is to help me with the children, and I'm to see to
things about the house more, and now and then have a little fun, just
to keep me from getting to be a fidgety, broken-down old woman before
my time. It's only an experiment, John, and I want to try it for your
sake as much as for mine, because I've neglected you shamefully lately,
and I'm going to make home what it used to be, if I can. You don't
object, I hope?''

 (<font color='red'><b>John/Mrs. Brooke/John Brooke</b></font>)</div><p/>Never mind what John said, or what a very narrow escape the little
bonnet had from utter ruin. All that we have any business to know is
that John did not appear to object, judging from the changes which
gradually took place in the house and its inmates. It was not all
Paradise by any means, but everyone was better for the division of
labor system. The children throve under the paternal rule, for
accurate, steadfast John brought order and obedience into Babydom, while
Meg recovered her (<font color='blue'><b>Meg</b></font>) spirits and composed her (<font color='blue'><b>Meg</b></font>) nerves by plenty of
wholesome exercise, a little pleasure, and much confidential
conversation with her (<font color='blue'><b>Meg</b></font>) sensible husband. Home grew homelike again, and
John had no wish to leave it, unless he (<font color='blue'><b>husband</b></font>) took Meg with him (<font color='blue'><b>husband</b></font>). The Scotts
came to the Brookes' now, and everyone found the little house a
cheerful place, full of happiness, content, and family love. Even
Sallie Moffatt liked to go there. <div class="bookquote">``It is always so quiet and pleasant
here, it does me good, Meg,''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Sallie</b></font>) used to say, looking about her (<font color='blue'><b>Sallie</b></font>) with
wistful eyes, as if trying to discover the charm, that she (<font color='blue'><b>Sallie</b></font>) might use it
in her (<font color='blue'><b>Sallie</b></font>) great house, full of splendid loneliness, for there were no
riotous, sunny-faced babies there, and Ned lived in a world of his (<font color='blue'><b>Ned</b></font>) own,
where there was no place for her (<font color='blue'><b>Sallie</b></font>).

<p/>This household happiness did not come all at once, but John and Meg had
found the key to it, and each year of married life taught them how to
use it, unlocking the treasuries of real home love and mutual
helpfulness, which the poorest may possess, and the richest cannot buy.
This is the sort of shelf on which young wives and mothers may consent
to be laid, safe from the restless fret and fever of the world, finding
loyal lovers in the little sons and daughters who cling to them,
undaunted by sorrow, poverty, or age, walking side by side, through
fair and stormy weather, with a faithful friend, who is, in the true
sense of the good old Saxon word, the `house-band', and learning, as
Meg learned, that a woman's happiest kingdom is home, her (<font color='blue'><b>Meg</b></font>) highest honor
the art of ruling it not as a queen, but as a wise wife and mother.



<p/>CHAPTER THIRTY-NINE

<p/>LAZY LAURENCE

<p/>Laurie went to Nice intending to stay a week, and remained a month. He (<font color='blue'><b>Saxon</b></font>)
was tired of wandering about alone, and Amy's familiar presence seemed
to give a homelike charm to the foreign scenes in which she (<font color='blue'><b>Amy</b></font>) bore a
part. He (<font color='blue'><b>Saxon</b></font>) rather missed the `petting' he (<font color='blue'><b>Saxon</b></font>) used to receive, and enjoyed a
taste of it again, for no attentions, however flattering, from
strangers, were half so pleasant as the sisterly adoration of the girls
at home. Amy never would pet him (<font color='blue'><b>Saxon</b></font>) like the others, but she (<font color='blue'><b>Amy</b></font>) was very
glad to see him (<font color='blue'><b>Saxon</b></font>) now, and quite clung to him (<font color='blue'><b>Saxon</b></font>), feeling that he (<font color='blue'><b>Saxon</b></font>) was the
representative of the dear family for whom she (<font color='blue'><b>Amy</b></font>) longed more than she (<font color='blue'><b>Amy</b></font>)
would confess. They naturally took comfort in each other's society and
were much together, riding, walking, dancing, or dawdling, for at Nice
no one can be very industrious during the gay season. But, while
apparently amusing themselves in the most careless fashion, they were
half-consciously making discoveries and forming opinions about each
other. Amy rose daily in the estimation of her (<font color='blue'><b>Amy</b></font>) friend, but he (<font color='blue'><b>friend</b></font>) sank in
hers, and each felt the truth before a word was spoken. Amy tried to
please, and succeeded, for she (<font color='blue'><b>Amy</b></font>) was grateful for the many pleasures he (<font color='blue'><b>friend</b></font>)
gave her (<font color='blue'><b>Amy</b></font>), and repaid him (<font color='blue'><b>friend</b></font>) with the little services to which womanly
women know how to lend an indescribable charm. Laurie made no effort
of any kind, but just let himself drift along as comfortably as
possible, trying to forget, and feeling that all women owed him (<font color='blue'><b>Laurie</b></font>) a kind
word because one had been cold to him (<font color='blue'><b>Laurie</b></font>). It cost him (<font color='blue'><b>Laurie</b></font>) no effort to be
generous, and he (<font color='blue'><b>Laurie</b></font>) would have given Amy all the trinkets in Nice if she (<font color='blue'><b>Amy</b></font>)
would have taken them, but at the same time he (<font color='blue'><b>Laurie</b></font>) felt that he (<font color='blue'><b>Laurie</b></font>) could not
change the opinion she (<font color='blue'><b>Amy</b></font>) was forming of him (<font color='blue'><b>Laurie</b></font>), and he (<font color='blue'><b>Laurie</b></font>) rather dreaded the
keen blue eyes that seemed to watch him (<font color='blue'><b>Laurie</b></font>) with such half-sorrowful,
half-scornful surprise.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``All the rest have gone to Monaco for the day. I preferred to stay at
home and write letters. They are done now, and I am going to Valrosa
to sketch, will you come?''  (<font color='red'><b>Amy/Amy March</b></font>)</div>said Amy, as she (<font color='blue'><b>Amy</b></font>) joined Laurie one lovely
day when he (<font color='blue'><b>Laurie</b></font>) lounged in as usual, about noon.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Well, yes, but isn't it rather warm for such a long walk?''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Laurie</b></font>) answered
slowly, for the shaded salon looked inviting after the glare without.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``I'm going to have the little carriage, and Baptiste can drive, so
you'll have nothing to do but hold your umbrella, and keep your gloves
nice,''  (<font color='red'><b>Amy/Amy March</b></font>)</div>returned Amy, with a sarcastic glance at the immaculate kids,
which were a weak point with Laurie.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Then I'll go with pleasure.''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>and he (<font color='blue'><b>Laurie</b></font>) put out his (<font color='blue'><b>Laurie</b></font>) hand for her (<font color='blue'><b>Amy</b></font>)
sketchbook. But she (<font color='blue'><b>Amy</b></font>) tucked it under her (<font color='blue'><b>Amy</b></font>) arm with a sharp...

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Don't trouble yourself. It's no exertion to me, but you don't look
equal to it.''

 (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div><p/>Laurie lifted his (<font color='blue'><b>Laurie</b></font>) eyebrows and followed at a leisurely pace as she (<font color='blue'><b>Amy</b></font>) ran
downstairs, but when they got into the carriage he (<font color='blue'><b>Laurie</b></font>) took the reins
himself, and left little Baptiste nothing to do but fold his (<font color='blue'><b>Baptiste</b></font>) arms and
fall asleep on his (<font color='blue'><b>Baptiste</b></font>) perch.

<p/>The two never quarreled. Amy was too well-bred, and just now Laurie
was too lazy, so in a minute he (<font color='blue'><b>Laurie</b></font>) peeped under her (<font color='blue'><b>Amy</b></font>) hatbrim with an
inquiring air. She (<font color='blue'><b>Amy</b></font>) answered him (<font color='blue'><b>Laurie</b></font>) with a smile, and they went on
together in the most amicable manner.

<p/>It was a lovely drive, along winding roads rich in the picturesque
scenes that delight beauty-loving eyes. Here an ancient monastery,
whence the solemn chanting of the monks came down to them. There a
bare-legged shepherd, in wooden shoes, pointed hat, and rough jacket
over one shoulder, sat piping on a stone while his (<font color='blue'><b>shepherd</b></font>) goats skipped among
the rocks or lay at his (<font color='blue'><b>shepherd</b></font>) feet. Meek, mouse-colored donkeys, laden with
panniers of freshly cut grass passed by, with a pretty girl in a
capaline sitting between the green piles, or an old woman spinning with
a distaff as she (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) went. Brown, soft-eyed children ran out from the
quaint stone hovels to offer nosegays, or bunches of oranges still on
the bough. Gnarled olive trees covered the hills with their dusky
foliage, fruit hung golden in the orchard, and great scarlet anemones
fringed the roadside, while beyond green slopes and craggy heights, the
Maritime Alps rose sharp and white against the blue Italian sky.

<p/>Valrosa well deserved its name, for in that climate of perpetual summer
roses blossomed everywhere. They overhung the archway, thrust
themselves between the bars of the great gate with a sweet welcome to
passers-by, and lined the avenue, winding through lemon trees and
feathery palms up to the villa on the hill. Every shadowy nook, where
seats invited one to stop and rest, was a mass of bloom, every cool
grotto had its marble nymph smiling from a veil of flowers and every
fountain reflected crimson, white, or pale pink roses, leaning down to
smile at their own beauty. Roses covered the walls of the house, draped
the cornices, climbed the pillars, and ran riot over the balustrade of
the wide terrace, whence one looked down on the sunny Mediterranean,
and the white-walled city on its shore.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``This is a regular honeymoon paradise, isn't it? Did you ever see such
roses?''  (<font color='red'><b>Amy/Amy March</b></font>)</div>asked Amy, pausing on the terrace to enjoy the view, and a
luxurious whiff of perfume that came wandering by.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``No, nor felt such thorns,''  (<font color='red'><b>Laurie/Mr. Laurie/LAURIE</b></font>)</div>returned Laurie, with his (<font color='blue'><b>Laurie</b></font>) thumb in his (<font color='blue'><b>Laurie</b></font>)
mouth, after a vain attempt to capture a solitary scarlet flower that
grew just beyond his (<font color='blue'><b>Laurie</b></font>) reach.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Try lower down, and pick those that have no thorns,''  (<font color='red'><b>Amy/Amy March</b></font>)</div>said Amy,
gathering three of the tiny cream-colored ones that starred the wall
behind her (<font color='blue'><b>Amy</b></font>). She (<font color='blue'><b>Amy</b></font>) put them in his (<font color='blue'><b>Laurie</b></font>) buttonhole as a peace offering, and he (<font color='blue'><b>Laurie</b></font>)
stood a minute looking down at them with a curious expression, for in
the Italian part of his (<font color='blue'><b>Laurie</b></font>) nature there was a touch of superstition, and
he (<font color='blue'><b>Laurie</b></font>) was just then in that state of half-sweet, half-bitter melancholy,
when imaginative young men find significance in trifles and food for
romance everywhere. He (<font color='blue'><b>Laurie</b></font>) had thought of Jo in reaching after the thorny
red rose, for vivid flowers became her (<font color='blue'><b>Jo</b></font>), and she (<font color='blue'><b>Jo</b></font>) had often worn ones
like that from the greenhouse at home. The pale roses Amy gave him (<font color='blue'><b>Laurie</b></font>)
were the sort that the Italians lay in dead hands, never in bridal
wreaths, and for a moment he (<font color='blue'><b>Laurie</b></font>) wondered if the omen was for Jo or for
himself, but the next instant his (<font color='blue'><b>Laurie</b></font>) American common sense got the better
of sentimentality, and he (<font color='blue'><b>Laurie</b></font>) laughed a heartier laugh than Amy had heard
since he (<font color='blue'><b>Laurie</b></font>) came.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``It's good advice, you'd better take it and save your fingers,''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Amy</b></font>)
said, thinking her (<font color='blue'><b>Amy</b></font>) speech amused him (<font color='blue'><b>Laurie</b></font>).

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Thank you, I will,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Laurie</b></font>) answered in jest, and a few months later he (<font color='blue'><b>Laurie</b></font>) did
it in earnest.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Laurie, when are you going to your grandfather?''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Amy</b></font>) asked presently,
as she (<font color='blue'><b>Amy</b></font>) settled herself on a rustic seat.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Very soon.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``You have said that a dozen times within the last three weeks.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I dare say, short answers save trouble.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``He (<font color='blue'><b>Laurie</b></font>) expects you, and you really ought to go.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Hospitable creature! I know it.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Then why don't you do it?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Natural depravity, I suppose.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Natural indolence, you mean. It's really dreadful!''  (<font color='red'><b>Amy/Amy March</b></font>)</div>and Amy looked
severe.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Not so bad as it seems, for I should only plague him (<font color='blue'><b>Laurie</b></font>) if I went, so I
might as well stay and plague you a little longer, you can bear it
better, in fact I think it agrees with you excellently,''  (<font color='red'><b>Laurie/Mr. Laurie/LAURIE</b></font>)</div>and Laurie
composed himself for a lounge on the broad ledge of the balustrade.

<p/>Amy shook her (<font color='blue'><b>Amy</b></font>) head and opened her (<font color='blue'><b>Amy</b></font>) sketchbook with an air of
resignation, but she (<font color='blue'><b>Amy</b></font>) had made up her (<font color='blue'><b>Amy</b></font>) mind to lecture `that boy' and in
a minute she (<font color='blue'><b>Amy</b></font>) began again.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``What are you doing just now?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Watching lizards.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``No, no. I mean what do you intend and wish to do?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Smoke a cigarette, if you'll allow me.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``How provoking you are! I don't approve of cigars and I will only
allow it on condition that you let me put you into my sketch. I need a
figure.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/>``With all the pleasure in life. How will you have me, full length or
three-quarters, on my head or my heels? I should respectfully suggest
a recumbent posture, then put yourself in also and call it <div class="bookquote">``Dolce far
niente'.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Stay as you are, and go to sleep if you like. I intend to work hard,''
 (<font color='red'><b>Amy/Amy March</b></font>)</div>said Amy in her (<font color='blue'><b>Amy</b></font>) most energetic tone.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``What delightful enthusiasm!''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>and he (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>) leaned against a tall urn with an
air of entire satisfaction.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``What would Jo say if she (<font color='blue'><b>Jo</b></font>) saw you now?''  (<font color='red'><b>Amy/Amy March</b></font>)</div>asked Amy impatiently, hoping
to stir him (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>) up by the mention of her (<font color='blue'><b>Amy</b></font>) still more energetic sister's name.

<p/>``As usual, <div class="bookquote">``Go away, Teddy. I'm busy!'''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>He (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>) laughed as he (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>) spoke, but
the laugh was not natural, and a shade passed over his (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>) face, for the
utterance of the familiar name touched the wound that was not healed
yet. Both tone and shadow struck Amy, for she (<font color='blue'><b>Amy</b></font>) had seen and heard them
before, and now she (<font color='blue'><b>Amy</b></font>) looked up in time to catch a new expression on
Laurie's face--a hard bitter look, full of pain, dissatisfaction, and
regret. It was gone before she (<font color='blue'><b>Amy</b></font>) could study it and the listless
expression back again. She (<font color='blue'><b>Amy</b></font>) watched him (<font color='blue'><b>Laurie</b></font>) for a moment with artistic
pleasure, thinking how like an Italian he (<font color='blue'><b>Laurie</b></font>) looked, as he (<font color='blue'><b>Laurie</b></font>) lay basking in
the sun with uncovered head and eyes full of southern dreaminess, for
he (<font color='blue'><b>Laurie</b></font>) seemed to have forgotten her (<font color='blue'><b>Amy</b></font>) and fallen into a reverie.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``You look like the effigy of a young knight asleep on his (<font color='blue'><b>knight</b></font>) tomb,''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Amy</b></font>)
said, carefully tracing the well-cut profile defined against the dark
stone.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Wish I was!''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``That's a foolish wish, unless you have spoiled your life. You are so
changed, I sometimes think--''  (<font color='red'><b>Amy/Amy March</b></font>)</div>there Amy stopped, with a half-timid,
half-wistful look, more significant than her (<font color='blue'><b>Amy</b></font>) unfinished speech.

<p/>Laurie saw and understood the affectionate anxiety which she (<font color='blue'><b>Amy</b></font>) hesitated
to express, and looking straight into her (<font color='blue'><b>Amy</b></font>) eyes, said, just as he (<font color='blue'><b>Laurie</b></font>) used
to say it to her (<font color='blue'><b>Amy</b></font>) mother, <div class="bookquote">``It's all right, ma'am.''

 (<font color='red'><b>mother</b></font>)</div><p/>That satisfied her (<font color='blue'><b>Amy</b></font>) and set at rest the doubts that had begun to worry
her (<font color='blue'><b>Amy</b></font>) lately. It also touched her (<font color='blue'><b>Amy</b></font>), and she (<font color='blue'><b>Amy</b></font>) showed that it did, by the
cordial tone in which she (<font color='blue'><b>Amy</b></font>) said...

<p/><div class="bookquote">``I'm glad of that! I didn't think you'd been a very bad boy, but I
fancied you might have wasted money at that wicked Baden-Baden, lost
your heart to some charming Frenchwoman with a husband, or got into
some of the scrapes that young men seem to consider a necessary part of
a foreign tour. Don't stay out there in the sun, come and lie on the
grass here and `let us be friendly', as Jo used to say when we got in
the sofa corner and told secrets.''

 (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div><p/>Laurie obediently threw himself down on the turf, and began to amuse
himself by sticking daisies into the ribbons of Amy's hat, that lay
there.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``I'm all ready for the secrets.''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>and he (<font color='blue'><b>Laurie</b></font>) glanced up with a decided
expression of interest in his (<font color='blue'><b>Laurie</b></font>) eyes.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``I've none to tell. You may begin.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Haven't one to bless myself with. I thought perhaps you'd had some
news from home..''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``You have heard all that has come lately. Don't you hear often? I
fancied Jo would send you volumes.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``She (<font color='blue'><b>Jo</b></font>)'s very busy. I'm roving about so, it's impossible to be regular,
you know. When do you begin your great work of art, Raphaella?''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Laurie</b></font>)
asked, changing the subject abruptly after another pause, in which he (<font color='blue'><b>Laurie</b></font>)
had been wondering if Amy knew his (<font color='blue'><b>Laurie</b></font>) secret and wanted to talk about it.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Never,''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Amy</b></font>) answered, with a despondent but decided air. <div class="bookquote">``Rome took
all the vanity out of me, for after seeing the wonders there, I felt
too insignificant to live and gave up all my foolish hopes in despair.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Why should you, with so much energy and talent?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``That's just why, because talent isn't genius, and no amount of energy
can make it so. I want to be great, or nothing. I won't be a
common-place dauber, so I don't intend to try any more.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``And what are you going to do with yourself now, if I may ask?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Polish up my other talents, and be an ornament to society, if I get
the chance.''

 (<font color='red'><b>audacity people</b></font>)</div><p/>It was a characteristic speech, and sounded daring, but audacity
becomes young people, and Amy's ambition had a good foundation. Laurie
smiled, but he (<font color='blue'><b>Laurie</b></font>) liked the spirit with which she (<font color='blue'><b>Amy</b></font>) took up a new purpose
when a long-cherished one died, and spent no time lamenting.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Good! And here is where Fred Vaughn comes in, I fancy.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Amy/Amy March</b></font>)</div><p/>Amy preserved a discreet silence, but there was a conscious look in her (<font color='blue'><b>Amy</b></font>)
downcast face that made Laurie sit up and say gravely, <div class="bookquote">``Now I'm going
to play brother, and ask questions. May I?''

 (<font color='red'><b>Laurie/Mr. Laurie/LAURIE</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I don't promise to answer.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Your face will, if your tongue won't. You aren't woman of the world
enough yet to hide your feelings, my dear. I heard rumors about Fred
and you last year, and it's my private opinion that if he (<font color='blue'><b>Fred</b></font>) had not been
called home so suddenly and detained so long, something would have come
of it, hey?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``That's not for me to say,''  (<font color='red'><b>Amy/Amy March</b></font>)</div>was Amy's grim reply, but her (<font color='blue'><b>Amy</b></font>) lips would
smile, and there was a traitorous sparkle of the eye which betrayed
that she (<font color='blue'><b>Amy</b></font>) knew her (<font color='blue'><b>Amy</b></font>) power and enjoyed the knowledge.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``You are not engaged, I hope?''  (<font color='red'><b>Laurie/Mr. Laurie/LAURIE</b></font>)</div>and Laurie looked very elder-brotherly
and grave all of a sudden.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``No.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``But you will be, if he (<font color='blue'><b>Fred</b></font>) comes back and goes properly down on his (<font color='blue'><b>Fred</b></font>) knees,
won't you?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Very likely.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Then you are fond of old Fred?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I could be, if I tried.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``But you don't intend to try till the proper moment? Bless my soul,
what unearthly prudence! He (<font color='blue'><b>Fred</b></font>)'s a good fellow, Amy, but not the man I
fancied you'd like.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``He (<font color='blue'><b>Fred</b></font>) is rich, a gentleman, and has delightful manners,''  (<font color='red'><b>Amy/Amy March</b></font>)</div>began Amy,
trying to be quite cool and dignified, but feeling a little ashamed of
herself, in spite of the sincerity of her (<font color='blue'><b>Amy</b></font>) intentions.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``I understand. Queens of society can't get on without money, so you
mean to make a good match, and start in that way? Quite right and
proper, as the world goes, but it sounds odd from the lips of one of
your mother's girls.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``True, nevertheless.''

 (<font color='red'><b>the speaker</b></font>)</div><p/>A short speech, but the quiet decision with which it was uttered
contrasted curiously with the young speaker. Laurie felt this
instinctively and laid himself down again, with a sense of
disappointment which he (<font color='blue'><b>Laurie</b></font>) could not explain. His (<font color='blue'><b>Laurie</b></font>) look and silence, as
well as a certain inward self-disapproval, ruffled Amy, and made her (<font color='blue'><b>Amy</b></font>)
resolve to deliver her (<font color='blue'><b>Amy</b></font>) lecture without delay.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``I wish you'd do me the favor to rouse yourself a little,''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Amy</b></font>) said
sharply.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Do it for me, there's a dear girl.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I could, if I tried.''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>and she (<font color='blue'><b>Amy</b></font>) looked as if she (<font color='blue'><b>Amy</b></font>) would like doing it in
the most summary style.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Try, then. I give you leave,''  (<font color='red'><b>Laurie/Mr. Laurie/LAURIE</b></font>)</div>returned Laurie, who enjoyed having
someone to tease, after his (<font color='blue'><b>Laurie</b></font>) long abstinence from his (<font color='blue'><b>Laurie</b></font>) favorite pastime.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``You'd be angry in five minutes.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I'm never angry with you. It takes two flints to make a fire. You are
as cool and soft as snow.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``You don't know what I can do. Snow produces a glow and a tingle, if
applied rightly. Your indifference is half affectation, and a good
stirring up would prove it.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Stir away, it won't hurt me and it may amuse you, as the big man said
when his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) little wife beat him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>). Regard me in the light of a husband or
a carpet, and beat till you are tired, if that sort of exercise agrees
with you.''

 (<font color='red'><b>him</b></font>)</div><p/>Being decidedly nettled herself, and longing to see him (<font color='blue'><b>Laurie</b></font>) shake off the
apathy that so altered him (<font color='blue'><b>Laurie</b></font>), Amy sharpened both tongue and pencil, and
began.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Flo and I have got a new name for you. It's Lazy Laurence. How do you
like it?''

 (<font color='red'><b>She</b></font>)</div><p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>Amy</b></font>) thought it would annoy him (<font color='blue'><b>Laurie</b></font>), but he (<font color='blue'><b>Laurie</b></font>) only folded his (<font color='blue'><b>Laurie</b></font>) arms under his (<font color='blue'><b>Laurie</b></font>)
head, with an imperturbable, <div class="bookquote">``That's not bad. Thank you, ladies.''

 (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Do you want to know what I honestly think of you?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Pining to be told.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Well, I despise you.''

 (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div><p/>If she (<font color='blue'><b>Amy</b></font>) had even said ``I hate you' in a petulant or coquettish tone, he (<font color='blue'><b>Laurence</b></font>)
would have laughed and rather liked it, but the grave, almost sad,
accent in her (<font color='blue'><b>Flo</b></font>) voice made him (<font color='blue'><b>Laurence</b></font>) open his (<font color='blue'><b>Laurence</b></font>) eyes, and ask quickly...

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Why, if you please?''

 (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Because, with every chance for being good, useful, and happy, you are
faulty, lazy, and miserable.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Strong language, mademoiselle.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``If you like it, I'll go on.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Pray do, it's quite interesting.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I thought you'd find it so. Selfish people always like to talk about
themselves.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Am I selfish?''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>the question slipped out involuntarily and in a tone of
surprise, for the one virtue on which he (<font color='blue'><b>Laurie</b></font>) prided himself was generosity.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Yes, very selfish,''  (<font color='red'><b>Amy/Amy March</b></font>)</div>continued Amy, in a calm, cool voice, twice as
effective just then as an angry one. <div class="bookquote">``I'll show you how, for I've
studied you while we were frolicking, and I'm not at all satisfied with
you. Here you have been abroad nearly six months, and done nothing but
waste time and money and disappoint your friends.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Isn't a fellow to have any pleasure after a four-year grind?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``You don't look as if you'd had much. At any rate, you are none the
better for it, as far as I can see. I said when we first met that you
had improved. Now I take it all back, for I don't think you half so
nice as when I left you at home. You have grown abominably lazy, you
like gossip, and waste time on frivolous things, you are contented to
be petted and admired by silly people, instead of being loved and
respected by wise ones. With money, talent, position, health, and
beauty, ah you like that old Vanity! But it's the truth, so I can't
help saying it, with all these splendid things to use and enjoy, you
can find nothing to do but dawdle, and instead of being the man you
ought to be, you are only...''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>there she (<font color='blue'><b>Amy</b></font>) stopped, with a look that had
both pain and pity in it.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Saint Laurence on a gridiron,''  (<font color='red'><b>Laurie/Mr. Laurie/LAURIE</b></font>)</div>added Laurie, blandly finishing the
sentence. But the lecture began to take effect, for there was a
wide-awake sparkle in his (<font color='blue'><b>Laurie</b></font>) eyes now and a half-angry, half-injured
expression replaced the former indifference.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``I supposed you'd take it so. You men tell us we are angels, and say
we can make you what we will, but the instant we honestly try to do you
good, you laugh at us and won't listen, which proves how much your
flattery is worth.''  (<font color='red'><b>Amy/Amy March</b></font>)</div>Amy spoke bitterly, and turned her (<font color='blue'><b>Amy</b></font>) back on the
exasperating martyr at her (<font color='blue'><b>Amy</b></font>) feet.

<p/>In a minute a hand came down over the page, so that she (<font color='blue'><b>Amy</b></font>) could not draw,
and Laurie's voice said, with a droll imitation of a penitent child, <div class="bookquote">``I
will be good, oh, I will be good!''

 (<font color='red'><b>a child</b></font>)</div><p/>But Amy did not laugh, for she (<font color='blue'><b>Amy</b></font>) was in earnest, and tapping on the
outspread hand with her (<font color='blue'><b>Amy</b></font>) pencil, said soberly, <div class="bookquote">``Aren't you ashamed of a
hand like that? It's as soft and white as a woman's, and looks as if
it never did anything but wear Jouvin's best gloves and pick flowers
for ladies. You are not a dandy, thank Heaven, so I'm glad to see
there are no diamonds or big seal rings on it, only the little old one
Jo gave you so long ago. Dear soul, I wish she (<font color='blue'><b>Jo</b></font>) was here to help me!''

 (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``So do I!''

 (<font color='red'><b>Amy/Amy March</b></font>)</div><p/>The hand vanished as suddenly as it came, and there was energy enough
in the echo of her (<font color='blue'><b>Amy</b></font>) wish to suit even Amy. She (<font color='blue'><b>Amy</b></font>) glanced down at him (<font color='blue'><b>Laurie</b></font>) with
a new thought in her (<font color='blue'><b>Amy</b></font>) mind, but he (<font color='blue'><b>Laurie</b></font>) was lying with his (<font color='blue'><b>Laurie</b></font>) hat half over his (<font color='blue'><b>Laurie</b></font>)
face, as if for shade, and his (<font color='blue'><b>Laurie</b></font>) mustache hid his (<font color='blue'><b>Laurie</b></font>) mouth. She (<font color='blue'><b>Amy</b></font>) only saw
his (<font color='blue'><b>Laurie</b></font>) chest rise and fall, with a long breath that might have been a
sigh, and the hand that wore the ring nestled down into the grass, as
if to hide something too precious or too tender to be spoken of. All in
a minute various hints and trifles assumed shape and significance in
Amy's mind, and told her (<font color='blue'><b>Amy</b></font>) what her (<font color='blue'><b>Amy</b></font>) sister never had confided to her (<font color='blue'><b>Amy</b></font>).
She (<font color='blue'><b>Amy</b></font>) remembered that Laurie never spoke voluntarily of Jo, she (<font color='blue'><b>Jo</b></font>) recalled
the shadow on his (<font color='blue'><b>Laurie</b></font>) face just now, the change in his (<font color='blue'><b>Laurie</b></font>) character, and the
wearing of the little old ring which was no ornament to a handsome
hand. Girls are quick to read such signs and feel their eloquence.
Amy had fancied that perhaps a love trouble was at the bottom of the
alteration, and now she (<font color='blue'><b>Amy</b></font>) was sure of it. Her (<font color='blue'><b>Amy</b></font>) keen eyes filled, and when
she (<font color='blue'><b>Amy</b></font>) spoke again, it was in a voice that could be beautifully soft and
kind when she (<font color='blue'><b>Amy</b></font>) chose to make it so.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``I know I have no right to talk so to you, Laurie, and if you weren't
the sweetest-tempered fellow in the world, you'd be very angry with me.
But we are all so fond and proud of you, I couldn't bear to think they
should be disappointed in you at home as I have been, though, perhaps
they would understand the change better than I do.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I think they would,''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>came from under the hat, in a grim tone, quite as
touching as a broken one.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``They ought to have told me, and not let me go blundering and scolding,
when I should have been more kind and patient than ever. I never did
like that Miss Randal and now I hate her (<font color='blue'><b>Randal</b></font>)!''  (<font color='red'><b>Amy/Amy March</b></font>)</div>said artful Amy, wishing to
be sure of her (<font color='blue'><b>Amy</b></font>) facts this time.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Hang Miss Randal!''  (<font color='red'><b>Laurie/Mr. Laurie/LAURIE</b></font>)</div>and Laurie knocked the hat off his (<font color='blue'><b>Laurie</b></font>) face with a look
that left no doubt of his (<font color='blue'><b>Laurie</b></font>) sentiments toward that young lady.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``I beg pardon, I thought...''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>and there she (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) paused diplomatically.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``No, you didn't, you knew perfectly well I never cared for anyone but
Jo,''  (<font color='red'><b>Laurie/Mr. Laurie/LAURIE</b></font>)</div>Laurie said that in his (<font color='blue'><b>Laurie</b></font>) old, impetuous tone, and turned his (<font color='blue'><b>Laurie</b></font>) face
away as he (<font color='blue'><b>Laurie</b></font>) spoke.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``I did think so, but as they never said anything about it, and you came
away, I supposed I was mistaken. And Jo wouldn't be kind to you? Why,
I was sure she (<font color='blue'><b>Jo</b></font>) loved you dearly.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``She (<font color='blue'><b>Jo</b></font>) was kind, but not in the right way, and it's lucky for her (<font color='blue'><b>Jo</b></font>) she (<font color='blue'><b>Jo</b></font>)
didn't love me, if I'm the good-for-nothing fellow you think me. It's
her (<font color='blue'><b>Jo</b></font>) fault though, and you may tell her (<font color='blue'><b>Jo</b></font>) so.''

 (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div><p/>The hard, bitter look came back again as he (<font color='blue'><b>Laurie</b></font>) said that, and it troubled
Amy, for she (<font color='blue'><b>Amy</b></font>) did not know what balm to apply.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``I was wrong, I didn't know. I'm very sorry I was so cross, but I
can't help wishing you'd bear it better, Teddy, dear.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Don't, that's her (<font color='blue'><b>Jo</b></font>) name for me!''  (<font color='red'><b>Laurie/Mr. Laurie/LAURIE</b></font>)</div>and Laurie put up his (<font color='blue'><b>Laurie</b></font>) hand with a
quick gesture to stop the words spoken in Jo's half-kind,
half-reproachful tone. <div class="bookquote">``Wait till you've tried it yourself,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Laurie</b></font>) added
in a low voice, as he (<font color='blue'><b>Laurie</b></font>) pulled up the grass by the handful.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``I'd take it manfully, and be respected if I couldn't be loved,''  (<font color='red'><b>Amy/Amy March</b></font>)</div>said
Amy, with the decision of one who knew nothing about it.

<p/>Now, Laurie flattered himself that he (<font color='blue'><b>Laurie</b></font>) had borne it remarkably well,
making no moan, asking no sympathy, and taking his (<font color='blue'><b>Laurie</b></font>) trouble away to live
it down alone. Amy's lecture put the matter in a new light, and for
the first time it did look weak and selfish to lose heart at the first
failure, and shut himself up in moody indifference. He (<font color='blue'><b>Laurie</b></font>) felt as if
suddenly shaken out of a pensive dream and found it impossible to go to
sleep again. Presently he (<font color='blue'><b>Laurie</b></font>) sat up and asked slowly, <div class="bookquote">``Do you think Jo
would despise me as you do?''

 (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Yes, if she (<font color='blue'><b>Jo</b></font>) saw you now. She (<font color='blue'><b>Jo</b></font>) hates lazy people. Why don't you do
something splendid, and make her (<font color='blue'><b>Jo</b></font>) love you?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I did my best, but it was no use.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Graduating well, you mean? That was no more than you ought to have
done, for your grandfather's sake. It would have been shameful to fail
after spending so much time and money, when everyone knew that you
could do well.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I did fail, say what you will, for Jo wouldn't love me,''  (<font color='red'><b>Laurie/Mr. Laurie/LAURIE</b></font>)</div>began Laurie,
leaning his (<font color='blue'><b>Laurie</b></font>) head on his (<font color='blue'><b>Laurie</b></font>) hand in a despondent attitude.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``No, you didn't, and you'll say so in the end, for it did you good, and
proved that you could do something if you tried. If you'd only set
about another task of some sort, you'd soon be your hearty, happy self
again, and forget your trouble.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``That's impossible.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/>``Try it and see. You needn't shrug your shoulders, and think, <div class="bookquote">``Much
she (<font color='blue'><b>Jo</b></font>) knows about such things'. I don't pretend to be wise, but I am
observing, and I see a great deal more than you'd imagine. I'm
interested in other people's experiences and inconsistencies, and
though I can't explain, I remember and use them for my own benefit.
Love Jo all your days, if you choose, but don't let it spoil you, for
it's wicked to throw away so many good gifts because you can't have the
one you want. There, I won't lecture any more, for I know you'll wake
up and be a man in spite of that hardhearted girl.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/>Neither spoke for several minutes. Laurie sat turning the little ring
on his (<font color='blue'><b>Laurie</b></font>) finger, and Amy put the last touches to the hasty sketch she (<font color='blue'><b>Amy</b></font>) had
been working at while she (<font color='blue'><b>Amy</b></font>) talked. Presently she (<font color='blue'><b>Amy</b></font>) put it on his (<font color='blue'><b>Laurie</b></font>) knee,
merely saying, <div class="bookquote">``How do you like that?''

 (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div><p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Laurie</b></font>) looked and then he (<font color='blue'><b>Laurie</b></font>) smiled, as he (<font color='blue'><b>Laurie</b></font>) could not well help doing, for it
was capitally done, the long, lazy figure on the grass, with listless
face, half-shut eyes, and one hand holding a cigar, from which came the
little wreath of smoke that encircled the dreamer's head.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``How well you draw!''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>dreamer</b></font>) said, with a genuine surprise and pleasure at
her (<font color='blue'><b>Amy</b></font>) skill, adding, with a half-laugh, <div class="bookquote">``Yes, that's me.''

 (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``As you are. This is as you were.''  (<font color='red'><b>Amy/Amy March</b></font>)</div>and Amy laid another sketch beside
the one he (<font color='blue'><b>dreamer</b></font>) held.

<p/>It was not nearly so well done, but there was a life and spirit in it
which atoned for many faults, and it recalled the past so vividly that
a sudden change swept over the young man's face as he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) looked. Only a
rough sketch of Laurie taming a horse. Hat and coat were off, and
every line of the active figure, resolute face, and commanding attitude
was full of energy and meaning. The handsome brute, just subdued,
stood arching his (<font color='blue'><b>Laurie</b></font>) neck under the tightly drawn rein, with one foot
impatiently pawing the ground, and ears pricked up as if listening for
the voice that had mastered him (<font color='blue'><b>Laurie</b></font>). In the ruffled mane, the rider's
breezy hair and erect attitude, there was a suggestion of suddenly
arrested motion, of strength, courage, and youthful buoyancy that
contrasted sharply with the supine grace of the '_Dolce far Niente_'
sketch. Laurie said nothing but as his (<font color='blue'><b>Laurie</b></font>) eye went from one to the other,
Amy saw him (<font color='blue'><b>Laurie</b></font>) flush up and fold his (<font color='blue'><b>Laurie</b></font>) lips together as if he (<font color='blue'><b>Laurie</b></font>) read and
accepted the little lesson she (<font color='blue'><b>Amy</b></font>) had given him (<font color='blue'><b>Laurie</b></font>). That satisfied her (<font color='blue'><b>Amy</b></font>), and
without waiting for him (<font color='blue'><b>Laurie</b></font>) to speak, she (<font color='blue'><b>Amy</b></font>) said, in her (<font color='blue'><b>Amy</b></font>) sprightly way...

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Don't you remember the day you played Rarey with Puck, and we all
looked on? Meg and Beth were frightened, but Jo clapped and pranced,
and I sat on the fence and drew you. I found that sketch in my
portfolio the other day, touched it up, and kept it to show you.''

 (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Much obliged. You've improved immensely since then, and I
congratulate you. May I venture to suggest in 'a honeymoon paradise'
that five o'clock is the dinner hour at your hotel?''

 (<font color='red'><b>Laurie/Mr. Laurie/LAURIE</b></font>)</div><p/>Laurie rose as he (<font color='blue'><b>Laurie</b></font>) spoke, returned the pictures with a smile and a bow
and looked at his (<font color='blue'><b>Laurie</b></font>) watch, as if to remind her (<font color='blue'><b>Amy</b></font>) that even moral lectures
should have an end. He (<font color='blue'><b>Laurie</b></font>) tried to resume his (<font color='blue'><b>Laurie</b></font>) former easy, indifferent
air, but it was an affectation now, for the rousing had been more
effacious than he (<font color='blue'><b>Laurie</b></font>) would confess. Amy felt the shade of coldness in his (<font color='blue'><b>Laurie</b></font>)
manner, and said to herself...

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Now, I've offended him (<font color='blue'><b>my</b></font>). Well, if it does him (<font color='blue'><b>my</b></font>) good, I'm glad, if it
makes him (<font color='blue'><b>my</b></font>) hate me, I'm sorry, but it's true, and I can't take back a
word of it.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Amy/Amy March</b></font>)</div><p/>They laughed and chatted all the way home, and little Baptiste, up
behind, thought that monsieur and madamoiselle were in charming
spirits. But both felt ill at ease. The friendly frankness was
disturbed, the sunshine had a shadow over it, and despite their
apparent gaiety, there was a secret discontent in the heart of each.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Shall we see you this evening, mon frere?''  (<font color='red'><b>Amy/Amy March</b></font>)</div>asked Amy, as they parted
at her (<font color='blue'><b>Amy</b></font>) aunt's door.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Unfortunately I have an engagement. Au revoir, madamoiselle,''  (<font color='red'><b>Laurie/Mr. Laurie/LAURIE</b></font>)</div>and
Laurie bent as if to kiss her (<font color='blue'><b>Amy</b></font>) hand, in the foreign fashion, which
became him (<font color='blue'><b>Laurie</b></font>) better than many men. Something in his (<font color='blue'><b>Laurie</b></font>) face made Amy say
quickly and warmly...

<p/><div class="bookquote">``No, be yourself with me, Laurie, and part in the good old way. I'd
rather have a hearty English handshake than all the sentimental
salutations in France.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Amy/Amy March</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Goodbye, dear,''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>and with these words, uttered in the tone she (<font color='blue'><b>Amy</b></font>) liked,
Laurie left her (<font color='blue'><b>Amy</b></font>), after a handshake almost painful in its heartiness.

<p/>Next morning, instead of the usual call, Amy received a note which made
her (<font color='blue'><b>Amy</b></font>) smile at the beginning and sigh at the end.

<p/>My Dear Mentor, Please make my adieux to your aunt, and exult within
yourself, for ``Lazy Laurence' has gone to his (<font color='blue'><b>Laurence</b></font>) grandpa, like the best of
boys. A pleasant winter to you, and may the gods grant you a blissful
honeymoon at Valrosa! I think Fred would be benefited by a rouser.
Tell him (<font color='blue'><b>Fred</b></font>) so, with my congratulations.

<p/>Yours gratefully, Telemachus


<p/><div class="bookquote">``Good boy! I'm glad he (<font color='blue'><b>Telemachus</b></font>)'s gone,''  (<font color='red'><b>Telemachus</b></font>)</div>said Amy, with an approving smile. The
next minute her (<font color='blue'><b>Amy</b></font>) face fell as she (<font color='blue'><b>Amy</b></font>) glanced about the empty room, adding,
with an involuntary sigh, <div class="bookquote">``Yes, I am glad, but how I shall miss him (<font color='blue'><b>Telemachus</b></font>).''



 (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div><p/>CHAPTER FORTY

<p/>THE VALLEY OF THE SHADOW

<p/>When the first bitterness was over, the family accepted the inevitable,
and tried to bear it cheerfully, helping one another by the increased
affection which comes to bind households tenderly together in times of
trouble. They put away their grief, and each did his (<font color='blue'><b>Mentor</b></font>) or her (<font color='blue'><b>Amy</b></font>) part
toward making that last year a happy one.

<p/>The pleasantest room in the house was set apart for Beth, and in it was
gathered everything that she (<font color='blue'><b>Beth</b></font>) most loved, flowers, pictures, her (<font color='blue'><b>Beth</b></font>) piano,
the little worktable, and the beloved pussies. Father's best books
found their way there, Mother's easy chair, Jo's desk, Amy's finest
sketches, and every day Meg brought her (<font color='blue'><b>Meg</b></font>) babies on a loving pilgrimage,
to make sunshine for Aunty Beth. John quietly set apart a little sum,
that he (<font color='blue'><b>Father</b></font>) might enjoy the pleasure of keeping the invalid supplied with
the fruit she (<font color='blue'><b>John</b></font>) loved and longed for. Old Hannah never wearied of
concocting dainty dishes to tempt a capricious appetite, dropping tears
as she (<font color='blue'><b>Hannah</b></font>) worked, and from across the sea came little gifts and cheerful
letters, seeming to bring breaths of warmth and fragrance from lands
that know no winter.

<p/>Here, cherished like a household saint in its shrine, sat Beth,
tranquil and busy as ever, for nothing could change the sweet,
unselfish nature, and even while preparing to leave life, she (<font color='blue'><b>Beth</b></font>) tried to
make it happier for those who should remain behind. The feeble fingers
were never idle, and one of her (<font color='blue'><b>Beth</b></font>) pleasures was to make little things for
the school children daily passing to and fro, to drop a pair of mittens
from her (<font color='blue'><b>Beth</b></font>) window for a pair of purple hands, a needlebook for some small
mother of many dolls, penwipers for young penmen toiling through
forests of pothooks, scrapbooks for picture-loving eyes, and all manner
of pleasant devices, till the reluctant climbers of the ladder of
learning found their way strewn with flowers, as it were, and came to
regard the gentle giver as a sort of fairy godmother, who sat above
there, and showered down gifts miraculously suited to their tastes and
needs. If Beth had wanted any reward, she (<font color='blue'><b>Beth</b></font>) found it in the bright
little faces always turned up to her (<font color='blue'><b>Beth</b></font>) window, with nods and smiles, and
the droll little letters which came to her (<font color='blue'><b>Beth</b></font>), full of blots and gratitude.

<p/>The first few months were very happy ones, and Beth often used to look
round, and say <div class="bookquote">``How beautiful this is!''  (<font color='red'><b>Beth</b></font>)</div>as they all sat together in her (<font color='blue'><b>Beth</b></font>)
sunny room, the babies kicking and crowing on the floor, mother and
sisters working near, and father reading, in his (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) pleasant voice, from
the wise old books which seemed rich in good and comfortable words, as
applicable now as when written centuries ago, a little chapel, where a
paternal priest taught his (<font color='blue'><b>priest</b></font>) flock the hard lessons all must learn,
trying to show them that hope can comfort love, and faith make
resignation possible. Simple sermons, that went straight to the souls
of those who listened, for the father's heart was in the minister's
religion, and the frequent falter in the voice gave a double eloquence
to the words he (<font color='blue'><b>minister</b></font>) spoke or read.

<p/>It was well for all that this peaceful time was given them as
preparation for the sad hours to come, for by-and-by, Beth said the
needle was `so heavy', and put it down forever. Talking wearied her (<font color='blue'><b>Beth</b></font>),
faces troubled her (<font color='blue'><b>Beth</b></font>), pain claimed her (<font color='blue'><b>Beth</b></font>) for its own, and her (<font color='blue'><b>Beth</b></font>) tranquil
spirit was sorrowfully perturbed by the ills that vexed her (<font color='blue'><b>Beth</b></font>) feeble
flesh. Ah me! Such heavy days, such long, long nights, such aching
hearts and imploring prayers, when those who loved her (<font color='blue'><b>Beth</b></font>) best were forced
to see the thin hands stretched out to them beseechingly, to hear the
bitter cry, <div class="bookquote">``Help me, help me!''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>and to feel that there was no help. A
sad eclipse of the serene soul, a sharp struggle of the young life with
death, but both were mercifully brief, and then the natural rebellion
over, the old peace returned more beautiful than ever. With the wreck
of her (<font color='blue'><b>Beth</b></font>) frail body, Beth's soul grew strong, and though she (<font color='blue'><b>Beth</b></font>) said little,
those about her (<font color='blue'><b>Beth</b></font>) felt that she (<font color='blue'><b>Beth</b></font>) was ready, saw that the first pilgrim
called was likewise the fittest, and waited with her (<font color='blue'><b>Beth</b></font>) on the shore,
trying to see the Shining Ones coming to receive her (<font color='blue'><b>Beth</b></font>) when she (<font color='blue'><b>Beth</b></font>) crossed
the river.

<p/>Jo never left her (<font color='blue'><b>Jo</b></font>) for an hour since Beth had said <div class="bookquote">``I feel stronger when
you are here.''  (<font color='red'><b>Beth</b></font>)</div>She (<font color='blue'><b>Beth</b></font>) slept on a couch in the room, waking often to renew
the fire, to feed, lift, or wait upon the patient creature who seldom
asked for anything, and `tried not to be a trouble'. All day she (<font color='blue'><b>Beth</b></font>)
haunted the room, jealous of any other nurse, and prouder of being
chosen then than of any honor her (<font color='blue'><b>Beth</b></font>) life ever brought her (<font color='blue'><b>Beth</b></font>). Precious and
helpful hours to Jo, for now her (<font color='blue'><b>Jo</b></font>) heart received the teaching that it
needed. Lessons in patience were so sweetly taught her (<font color='blue'><b>Jo</b></font>) that she (<font color='blue'><b>Jo</b></font>) could
not fail to learn them, charity for all, the lovely spirit that can
forgive and truly forget unkindness, the loyalty to duty that makes the
hardest easy, and the sincere faith that fears nothing, but trusts
undoubtingly.

<p/>Often when she (<font color='blue'><b>Jo</b></font>) woke Jo found Beth reading in her (<font color='blue'><b>Beth</b></font>) well-worn little book,
heard her (<font color='blue'><b>Beth</b></font>) singing softly, to beguile the sleepless night, or saw her (<font color='blue'><b>Beth</b></font>)
lean her (<font color='blue'><b>Beth</b></font>) face upon her (<font color='blue'><b>Beth</b></font>) hands, while slow tears dropped through the
transparent fingers, and Jo would lie watching her (<font color='blue'><b>Jo</b></font>) with thoughts too
deep for tears, feeling that Beth, in her (<font color='blue'><b>Beth</b></font>) simple, unselfish way, was
trying to wean herself from the dear old life, and fit herself for the
life to come, by sacred words of comfort, quiet prayers, and the music
she (<font color='blue'><b>Beth</b></font>) loved so well.

<p/>Seeing this did more for Jo than the wisest sermons, the saintliest
hymns, the most fervent prayers that any voice could utter. For with
eyes made clear by many tears, and a heart softened by the tenderest
sorrow, she (<font color='blue'><b>Jo</b></font>) recognized the beauty of her (<font color='blue'><b>Jo</b></font>) sister's life--uneventful,
unambitious, yet full of the genuine virtues which `smell sweet, and
blossom in the dust', the self-forgetfulness that makes the humblest on
earth remembered soonest in heaven, the true success which is possible
to all.

<p/>One night when Beth looked among the books upon her (<font color='blue'><b>Beth</b></font>) table, to find
something to make her (<font color='blue'><b>Beth</b></font>) forget the mortal weariness that was almost as
hard to bear as pain, as she (<font color='blue'><b>Beth</b></font>) turned the leaves of her (<font color='blue'><b>Beth</b></font>) old favorite,
Pilgrims's Progress, she (<font color='blue'><b>Beth</b></font>) found a little paper, scribbled over in Jo's
hand. The name caught her (<font color='blue'><b>Jo</b></font>) eye and the blurred look of the lines made
her (<font color='blue'><b>Jo</b></font>) sure that tears had fallen on it.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Poor Jo! She (<font color='blue'><b>Jo</b></font>)'s fast asleep, so I won't wake her (<font color='blue'><b>Jo</b></font>) to ask leave. She (<font color='blue'><b>Jo</b></font>)
shows me all her (<font color='blue'><b>Jo</b></font>) things, and I don't think she (<font color='blue'><b>Jo</b></font>)'ll mind if I look at
this'' (<font color='red'><b>Beth</b></font>)</div>, thought Beth, with a glance at her (<font color='blue'><b>Beth</b></font>) sister, who lay on the rug,
with the tongs beside her (<font color='blue'><b>Beth</b></font>), ready to wake up the minute the log fell
apart.

<p/>MY BETH

<p/>Sitting patient in the shadow
Till the blessed light shall come,
A serene and saintly presence
Sanctifies our troubled home.
Earthly joys and hopes and sorrows
Break like ripples on the strand
Of the deep and solemn river
Where her (<font color='blue'><b>MY</b></font>) willing feet now stand.

<p/>O my sister, passing from me,
Out of human care and strife,
Leave me, as a gift, those virtues
Which have beautified your life.
Dear, bequeath me that great patience
Which has power to sustain
A cheerful, uncomplaining spirit
In its prison-house of pain.

<p/>Give me, for I need it sorely,
Of that courage, wise and sweet,
Which has made the path of duty
Green beneath your willing feet.
Give me that unselfish nature,
That with charity divine
Can pardon wrong for love's dear sake--
Meek heart, forgive me mine!

<p/>Thus our parting daily loseth
Something of its bitter pain,
And while learning this hard lesson,
My great loss becomes my gain.
For the touch of grief will render
My wild nature more serene,
Give to life new aspirations,
A new trust in the unseen.

<p/>Henceforth, safe across the river,
I shall see forever more
A beloved, household spirit
Waiting for me on the shore.
Hope and faith, born of my sorrow,
Guardian angels shall become,
And the sister gone before me
By their hands shall lead me home.

<p/>Blurred and blotted, faulty and feeble as the lines were, they brought
a look of inexpressible comfort to Beth's face, for her (<font color='blue'><b>Beth</b></font>) one regret had
been that she (<font color='blue'><b>Beth</b></font>) had done so little, and this seemed to assure her (<font color='blue'><b>Beth</b></font>) that
her (<font color='blue'><b>Beth</b></font>) life had not been useless, that her (<font color='blue'><b>Beth</b></font>) death would not bring the
despair she (<font color='blue'><b>Beth</b></font>) feared. As she (<font color='blue'><b>Beth</b></font>) sat with the paper folded between her (<font color='blue'><b>Beth</b></font>)
hands, the charred log fell asunder. Jo started up, revived the blaze,
and crept to the bedside, hoping Beth slept.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Not asleep, but so happy, dear. See, I found this and read it. I knew
you wouldn't care. Have I been all that to you, Jo?''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Beth</b></font>) asked, with
wistful, humble earnestness.

<p/><div class="bookquote">''_Oh_, Beth, so much, so much!''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>and Jo's head went down upon the pillow
beside her (<font color='blue'><b>Jo</b></font>) sister's.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Then I don't feel as if I'd wasted my life. I'm not so good as you
make me, but I have tried to do right. And now, when it's too late to
begin even to do better, it's such a comfort to know that someone loves
me so much, and feels as if I'd helped them.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``More than any one in the world, Beth. I used to think I couldn't let
you go, but I'm learning to feel that I don't lose you, that you'll be
more to me than ever, and death can't part us, though it seems to.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I know it cannot, and I don't fear it any longer, for I'm sure I shall
be your Beth still, to love and help you more than ever. You must take
my place, Jo, and be everything to Father and Mother when I'm gone.
They will turn to you, don't fail them, and if it's hard to work alone,
remember that I don't forget you, and that you'll be happier in doing
that than writing splendid books or seeing all the world, for love is
the only thing that we can carry with us when we go, and it makes the
end so easy.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I'll try, Beth.''  (<font color='red'><b>Jo/Miss Jo/JO</b></font>)</div>and then and there Jo renounced her (<font color='blue'><b>Jo</b></font>) old ambition,
pledged herself to a new and better one, acknowledging the poverty of
other desires, and feeling the blessed solace of a belief in the
immortality of love.

<p/>So the spring days came and went, the sky grew clearer, the earth
greener, the flowers were up fairly early, and the birds came back in
time to say goodbye to Beth, who, like a tired but trustful child,
clung to the hands that had led her (<font color='blue'><b>Beth</b></font>) all her (<font color='blue'><b>Beth</b></font>) life, as Father and Mother
guided her (<font color='blue'><b>Mother</b></font>) tenderly through the Valley of the Shadow, and gave her (<font color='blue'><b>Mother</b></font>) up
to God.

<p/>Seldom except in books do the dying utter memorable words, see visions,
or depart with beatified countenances, and those who have sped many
parting souls know that to most the end comes as naturally and simply
as sleep. As Beth had hoped, the `tide went out easily', and in the
dark hour before dawn, on the bosom where she (<font color='blue'><b>Beth</b></font>) had drawn her (<font color='blue'><b>Beth</b></font>) first
breath, she (<font color='blue'><b>Beth</b></font>) quietly drew her (<font color='blue'><b>Beth</b></font>) last, with no farewell but one loving
look, one little sigh.

<p/>With tears and prayers and tender hands, Mother and sisters made her (<font color='blue'><b>Mother</b></font>)
ready for the long sleep that pain would never mar again, seeing with
grateful eyes the beautiful serenity that soon replaced the pathetic
patience that had wrung their hearts so long, and feeling with reverent
joy that to their darling death was a benignant angel, not a phantom
full of dread.

<p/>When morning came, for the first time in many months the fire was out,
Jo's place was empty, and the room was very still. But a bird sang
blithely on a budding bough, close by, the snowdrops blossomed freshly
at the window, and the spring sunshine streamed in like a benediction
over the placid face upon the pillow, a face so full of painless peace
that those who loved it best smiled through their tears, and thanked
God that Beth was well at last.



<p/>CHAPTER FORTY-ONE

<p/>LEARNING TO FORGET

<p/>Amy's lecture did Laurie good, though, of course, he (<font color='blue'><b>Laurie</b></font>) did not own it
till long afterward. Men seldom do, for when women are the advisers,
the lords of creation don't take the advice till they have persuaded
themselves that it is just what they intended to do. Then they act
upon it, and, if it succeeds, they give the weaker vessel half the
credit of it. If it fails, they generously give her (<font color='blue'><b>Beth</b></font>) the whole. Laurie
went back to his (<font color='blue'><b>Laurie</b></font>) grandfather, and was so dutifully devoted for several
weeks that the old gentleman declared the climate of Nice had improved
him (<font color='blue'><b>gentleman</b></font>) wonderfully, and he (<font color='blue'><b>gentleman</b></font>) had better try it again. There was nothing the
young gentleman would have liked better, but elephants could not have
dragged him (<font color='blue'><b>gentleman</b></font>) back after the scolding he (<font color='blue'><b>gentleman</b></font>) had received. Pride forbid, and
whenever the longing grew very strong, he (<font color='blue'><b>gentleman</b></font>) fortified his (<font color='blue'><b>gentleman</b></font>) resolution by
repeating the words that had made the deepest impression--<div class="bookquote">``I despise
you.''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``Go and do something splendid that will make her (<font color='blue'><b>Beth</b></font>) love you.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Laurie/Mr. Laurie/LAURIE</b></font>)</div><p/>Laurie turned the matter over in his (<font color='blue'><b>Laurie</b></font>) mind so often that he (<font color='blue'><b>Laurie</b></font>) soon brought
himself to confess that he (<font color='blue'><b>Laurie</b></font>) had been selfish and lazy, but then when a
man has a great sorrow, he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) should be indulged in all sorts of vagaries
till he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) has lived it down. He (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) felt that his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) blighted affections were
quite dead now, and though he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) should never cease to be a faithful
mourner, there was no occasion to wear his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) weeds ostentatiously. Jo
wouldn't love him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>), but he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) might make her (<font color='blue'><b>Jo</b></font>) respect and admire him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) by
doing something which should prove that a girl's ``No' had not spoiled
his (<font color='blue'><b>it</b></font>) life. He (<font color='blue'><b>it</b></font>) had always meant to do something, and Amy's advice was
quite unnecessary. He (<font color='blue'><b>it</b></font>) had only been waiting till the aforesaid
blighted affections were decently interred. That being done, he (<font color='blue'><b>it</b></font>) felt
that he (<font color='blue'><b>it</b></font>) was ready to `hide his (<font color='blue'><b>it</b></font>) stricken heart, and still toil on'.

<p/>As Goethe, when he (<font color='blue'><b>Goethe</b></font>) had a joy or a grief, put it into a song, so Laurie
resolved to embalm his (<font color='blue'><b>Laurie</b></font>) love sorrow in music, and to compose a Requiem
which should harrow up Jo's soul and melt the heart of every hearer.
Therefore the next time the old gentleman found him (<font color='blue'><b>gentleman</b></font>) getting restless
and moody and ordered him (<font color='blue'><b>gentleman</b></font>) off, he (<font color='blue'><b>gentleman</b></font>) went to Vienna, where he (<font color='blue'><b>gentleman</b></font>) had musical
friends, and fell to work with the firm determination to distinguish
himself. But whether the sorrow was too vast to be embodied in music,
or music too ethereal to uplift a mortal woe, he (<font color='blue'><b>gentleman</b></font>) soon discovered that
the Requiem was beyond him (<font color='blue'><b>gentleman</b></font>) just at present. It was evident that his (<font color='blue'><b>gentleman</b></font>)
mind was not in working order yet, and his (<font color='blue'><b>gentleman</b></font>) ideas needed clarifying, for
often in the middle of a plaintive strain, he (<font color='blue'><b>gentleman</b></font>) would find himself
humming a dancing tune that vividly recalled the Christmas ball at
Nice, especially the stout Frenchman, and put an effectual stop to
tragic composition for the time being.

<p/>Then he (<font color='blue'><b>Frenchman</b></font>) tried an opera, for nothing seemed impossible in the beginning,
but here again unforeseen difficulties beset him (<font color='blue'><b>Frenchman</b></font>). He (<font color='blue'><b>Frenchman</b></font>) wanted Jo for his (<font color='blue'><b>Frenchman</b></font>)
heroine, and called upon his (<font color='blue'><b>Frenchman</b></font>) memory to supply him (<font color='blue'><b>Frenchman</b></font>) with tender
recollections and romantic visions of his (<font color='blue'><b>Frenchman</b></font>) love. But memory turned
traitor, and as if possessed by the perverse spirit of the girl, would
only recall Jo's oddities, faults, and freaks, would only show her (<font color='blue'><b>Jo</b></font>) in
the most unsentimental aspects--beating mats with her (<font color='blue'><b>Jo</b></font>) head tied up in a
bandanna, barricading herself with the sofa pillow, or throwing cold
water over his (<font color='blue'><b>Frenchman</b></font>) passion a la Gummidge--and an irresistable laugh spoiled
the pensive picture he (<font color='blue'><b>Frenchman</b></font>) was endeavoring to paint. Jo wouldn't be put
into the opera at any price, and he (<font color='blue'><b>Frenchman</b></font>) had to give her (<font color='blue'><b>Jo</b></font>) up with a <div class="bookquote">``Bless
that girl, what a torment she (<font color='blue'><b>Jo</b></font>) is!''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>and a clutch at his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) hair, as became
a distracted composer.

<p/>When he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) looked about him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) for another and a less intractable damsel to
immortalize in melody, memory produced one with the most obliging
readiness. This phantom wore many faces, but it always had golden
hair, was enveloped in a diaphanous cloud, and floated airily before
his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) mind's eye in a pleasing chaos of roses, peacocks, white ponies,
and blue ribbons. He (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) did not give the complacent wraith any name, but
he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) took her (<font color='blue'><b>damsel</b></font>) for his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) heroine and grew quite fond of her (<font color='blue'><b>damsel</b></font>), as well he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>)
might, for he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) gifted her (<font color='blue'><b>damsel</b></font>) with every gift and grace under the sun, and
escorted her (<font color='blue'><b>damsel</b></font>), unscathed, through trials which would have annihilated
any mortal woman.

<p/>Thanks to this inspiration, he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) got on swimmingly for a time, but
gradually the work lost its charm, and he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) forgot to compose, while he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>)
sat musing, pen in hand, or roamed about the gay city to get some new
ideas and refresh his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) mind, which seemed to be in a somewhat unsettled
state that winter. He (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) did not do much, but he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) thought a great deal and
was conscious of a change of some sort going on in spite of himself.
<div class="bookquote">``It's genius simmering, perhaps. I'll let it simmer, and see what
comes of it,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) said, with a secret suspicion all the while that it
wasn't genius, but something far more common. Whatever it was, it
simmered to some purpose, for he (<font color='blue'><b>genius</b></font>) grew more and more discontented with
his (<font color='blue'><b>genius</b></font>) desultory life, began to long for some real and earnest work to go
at, soul and body, and finally came to the wise conclusion that
everyone who loved music was not a composer. Returning from one of
Mozart's grand operas, splendidly performed at the Royal Theatre, he (<font color='blue'><b>Mozart</b></font>)
looked over his (<font color='blue'><b>Mozart</b></font>) own, played a few of the best parts, sat staring at the
busts of Mendelssohn, Beethoven, and Bach, who stared benignly back
again. Then suddenly he (<font color='blue'><b>Bach</b></font>) tore up his (<font color='blue'><b>Bach</b></font>) music sheets, one by one, and as
the last fluttered out of his (<font color='blue'><b>Bach</b></font>) hand, he (<font color='blue'><b>Bach</b></font>) said soberly to himself...

<p/><div class="bookquote">``She (<font color='blue'><b>Jo</b></font>) is right! Talent isn't genius, and you can't make it so. That
music has taken the vanity out of me as Rome took it out of her (<font color='blue'><b>Jo</b></font>), and I
won't be a humbug any longer. Now what shall I do?''

 (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div><p/>That seemed a hard question to answer, and Laurie began to wish he (<font color='blue'><b>Laurie</b></font>) had
to work for his (<font color='blue'><b>Laurie</b></font>) daily bread. Now if ever, occurred an eligible
opportunity for `going to the devil', as he (<font color='blue'><b>devil</b></font>) once forcibly expressed it,
for he (<font color='blue'><b>devil</b></font>) had plenty of money and nothing to do, and Satan is proverbially
fond of providing employment for full and idle hands. The poor fellow
had temptations enough from without and from within, but he (<font color='blue'><b>fellow</b></font>) withstood
them pretty well, for much as he (<font color='blue'><b>fellow</b></font>) valued liberty, he (<font color='blue'><b>fellow</b></font>) valued good faith
and confidence more, so his (<font color='blue'><b>fellow</b></font>) promise to his (<font color='blue'><b>fellow</b></font>) grandfather, and his (<font color='blue'><b>fellow</b></font>) desire
to be able to look honestly into the eyes of the women who loved him (<font color='blue'><b>fellow</b></font>),
and say <div class="bookquote">``All's well,''  (<font color='red'><b>him</b></font>)</div>kept him (<font color='blue'><b>fellow</b></font>) safe and steady.

<p/>Very likely some Mrs. Grundy will observe, <div class="bookquote">``I don't believe it, boys
will be boys, young men must sow their wild oats, and women must not
expect miracles.''  (<font color='red'><b>Mrs. Grundy</b></font>)</div>I dare say you don't, Mrs. Grundy, but it's true
nevertheless. Women work a good many miracles, and I have a persuasion
that they may perform even that of raising the standard of manhood by
refusing to echo such sayings. Let the boys be boys, the longer the
better, and let the young men sow their wild oats if they must. But
mothers, sisters, and friends may help to make the crop a small one,
and keep many tares from spoiling the harvest, by believing, and
showing that they believe, in the possibility of loyalty to the virtues
which make men manliest in good women's eyes. If it is a feminine
delusion, leave us to enjoy it while we may, for without it half the
beauty and the romance of life is lost, and sorrowful forebodings would
embitter all our hopes of the brave, tenderhearted little lads, who
still love their mothers better than themselves and are not ashamed to
own it.

<p/>Laurie thought that the task of forgetting his (<font color='blue'><b>Laurie</b></font>) love for Jo would absorb
all his (<font color='blue'><b>Laurie</b></font>) powers for years, but to his (<font color='blue'><b>Laurie</b></font>) great surprise he (<font color='blue'><b>Laurie</b></font>) discovered it
grew easier every day. He (<font color='blue'><b>Laurie</b></font>) refused to believe it at first, got angry
with himself, and couldn't understand it, but these hearts of ours are
curious and contrary things, and time and nature work their will in
spite of us. Laurie's heart wouldn't ache. The wound persisted in
healing with a rapidity that astonished him (<font color='blue'><b>Laurie</b></font>), and instead of trying to
forget, he (<font color='blue'><b>Laurie</b></font>) found himself trying to remember. He (<font color='blue'><b>Laurie</b></font>) had not foreseen this
turn of affairs, and was not prepared for it. He (<font color='blue'><b>Laurie</b></font>) was disgusted with
himself, surprised at his (<font color='blue'><b>Laurie</b></font>) own fickleness, and full of a queer mixture
of disappointment and relief that he (<font color='blue'><b>Laurie</b></font>) could recover from such a
tremendous blow so soon. He (<font color='blue'><b>Laurie</b></font>) carefully stirred up the embers of his (<font color='blue'><b>Laurie</b></font>)
lost love, but they refused to burst into a blaze. There was only a
comfortable glow that warmed and did him (<font color='blue'><b>Laurie</b></font>) good without putting him (<font color='blue'><b>Laurie</b></font>) into
a fever, and he (<font color='blue'><b>Laurie</b></font>) was reluctantly obliged to confess that the boyish
passion was slowly subsiding into a more tranquil sentiment, very
tender, a little sad and resentful still, but that was sure to pass
away in time, leaving a brotherly affection which would last unbroken
to the end.

<p/>As the word `brotherly' passed through his (<font color='blue'><b>Laurie</b></font>) mind in one of his (<font color='blue'><b>Laurie</b></font>) reveries,
he (<font color='blue'><b>Laurie</b></font>) smiled, and glanced up at the picture of Mozart that was before
him (<font color='blue'><b>Mozart</b></font>)...

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Well, he (<font color='blue'><b>genius</b></font>) was a great man, and when he (<font color='blue'><b>genius</b></font>) couldn't have one sister he (<font color='blue'><b>genius</b></font>) took
the other, and was happy.''

 (<font color='red'><b>him</b></font>)</div><p/>Laurie did not utter the words, but he (<font color='blue'><b>Laurie</b></font>) thought them, and the next
instant kissed the little old ring, saying to himself, <div class="bookquote">``No, I won't! I
haven't forgotten, I never can. I'll try again, and if that fails, why
then...''

 (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div><p/>Leaving his (<font color='blue'><b>Laurie</b></font>) sentence unfinished, he (<font color='blue'><b>Laurie</b></font>) seized pen and paper and wrote to
Jo, telling her (<font color='blue'><b>Jo</b></font>) that he (<font color='blue'><b>Laurie</b></font>) could not settle to anything while there was
the least hope of her (<font color='blue'><b>Jo</b></font>) changing her (<font color='blue'><b>Jo</b></font>) mind. Couldn't she (<font color='blue'><b>Jo</b></font>), wouldn't
she (<font color='blue'><b>Jo</b></font>)--and let him (<font color='blue'><b>Laurie</b></font>) come home and be happy? While waiting for an answer he (<font color='blue'><b>Laurie</b></font>)
did nothing, but he (<font color='blue'><b>Laurie</b></font>) did it energetically, for he (<font color='blue'><b>Laurie</b></font>) was in a fever of
impatience. It came at last, and settled his (<font color='blue'><b>Laurie</b></font>) mind effectually on one
point, for Jo decidedly couldn't and wouldn't. She (<font color='blue'><b>Jo</b></font>) was wrapped up in
Beth, and never wished to hear the word love again. Then she (<font color='blue'><b>Jo</b></font>) begged
him (<font color='blue'><b>Laurie</b></font>) to be happy with somebody else, but always keep a little corner of
his (<font color='blue'><b>Laurie</b></font>) heart for his (<font color='blue'><b>Laurie</b></font>) loving sister Jo. In a postscript she (<font color='blue'><b>Jo</b></font>) desired him (<font color='blue'><b>Laurie</b></font>)
not to tell Amy that Beth was worse, she (<font color='blue'><b>Beth</b></font>) was coming home in the spring
and there was no need of saddening the remainder of her (<font color='blue'><b>Beth</b></font>) stay. That
would be time enough, please God, but Laurie must write to her (<font color='blue'><b>Beth</b></font>) often,
and not let her (<font color='blue'><b>Beth</b></font>) feel lonely, homesick or anxious.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``So I will, at once. Poor little girl, it will be a sad going home for
her (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>), I'm afraid,''  (<font color='red'><b>Laurie/Mr. Laurie/LAURIE</b></font>)</div>and Laurie opened his (<font color='blue'><b>Laurie</b></font>) desk, as if writing to Amy had
been the proper conclusion of the sentence left unfinished some weeks
before.

<p/>But he (<font color='blue'><b>Laurie</b></font>) did not write the letter that day, for as he (<font color='blue'><b>Laurie</b></font>) rummaged out his (<font color='blue'><b>Laurie</b></font>)
best paper, he (<font color='blue'><b>Laurie</b></font>) came across something which changed his (<font color='blue'><b>Laurie</b></font>) purpose.
Tumbling about in one part of the desk among bills, passports, and
business documents of various kinds were several of Jo's letters, and
in another compartment were three notes from Amy, carefully tied up
with one of her (<font color='blue'><b>Amy</b></font>) blue ribbons and sweetly suggestive of the little dead
roses put away inside. With a half-repentant, half-amused expression,
Laurie gathered up all Jo's letters, smoothed, folded, and put them
neatly into a small drawer of the desk, stood a minute turning the ring
thoughtfully on his (<font color='blue'><b>Laurie</b></font>) finger, then slowly drew it off, laid it with the
letters, locked the drawer, and went out to hear High Mass at Saint
Stefan's, feeling as if there had been a funeral, and though not
overwhelmed with affliction, this seemed a more proper way to spend the
rest of the day than in writing letters to charming young ladies.

<p/>The letter went very soon, however, and was promptly answered, for Amy
was homesick, and confessed it in the most delightfully confiding
manner. The correspondence flourished famously, and letters flew to
and fro with unfailing regularity all through the early spring. Laurie
sold his (<font color='blue'><b>Laurie</b></font>) busts, made allumettes of his (<font color='blue'><b>Laurie</b></font>) opera, and went back to Paris,
hoping somebody would arrive before long. He (<font color='blue'><b>Laurie</b></font>) wanted desperately to go
to Nice, but would not till he (<font color='blue'><b>Laurie</b></font>) was asked, and Amy would not ask him (<font color='blue'><b>Laurie</b></font>),
for just then she (<font color='blue'><b>Amy</b></font>) was having little experiences of her (<font color='blue'><b>Amy</b></font>) own, which made
her (<font color='blue'><b>Amy</b></font>) rather wish to avoid the quizzical eyes of `our boy'.

<p/>Fred Vaughn had returned, and put the question to which she (<font color='blue'><b>Amy</b></font>) had once
decided to answer, <div class="bookquote">``Yes, thank you,''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>but now she (<font color='blue'><b>Amy</b></font>) said, <div class="bookquote">``No, thank you,''
 (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>kindly but steadily, for when the time came, her (<font color='blue'><b>Amy</b></font>) courage failed her (<font color='blue'><b>Amy</b></font>),
and she (<font color='blue'><b>Amy</b></font>) found that something more than money and position was needed to
satisfy the new longing that filled her (<font color='blue'><b>Amy</b></font>) heart so full of tender hopes
and fears. The words, <div class="bookquote">``Fred is a good fellow, but not at all the man I
fancied you would ever like,''  (<font color='red'><b>Laurie/Mr. Laurie/LAURIE</b></font>)</div>and Laurie's face when he (<font color='blue'><b>Laurie</b></font>) uttered them,
kept returning to her (<font color='blue'><b>Amy</b></font>) as pertinaciously as her (<font color='blue'><b>Amy</b></font>) own did when she (<font color='blue'><b>Amy</b></font>) said in
look, if not in words, <div class="bookquote">``I shall marry for money.''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>It troubled her (<font color='blue'><b>Amy</b></font>) to
remember that now, she (<font color='blue'><b>Amy</b></font>) wished she (<font color='blue'><b>Amy</b></font>) could take it back, it sounded so
unwomanly. She (<font color='blue'><b>Amy</b></font>) didn't want Laurie to think her (<font color='blue'><b>Amy</b></font>) a heartless, worldly
creature. She (<font color='blue'><b>Amy</b></font>) didn't care to be a queen of society now half so much as
she (<font color='blue'><b>Amy</b></font>) did to be a lovable woman. She (<font color='blue'><b>Amy</b></font>) was so glad he (<font color='blue'><b>Laurie</b></font>) didn't hate her (<font color='blue'><b>Amy</b></font>) for
the dreadful things she (<font color='blue'><b>Amy</b></font>) said, but took them so beautifully and was
kinder than ever. His (<font color='blue'><b>Laurie</b></font>) letters were such a comfort, for the home
letters were very irregular and not half so satisfactory as his (<font color='blue'><b>Laurie</b></font>) when
they did come. It was not only a pleasure, but a duty to answer them,
for the poor fellow was forlorn, and needed petting, since Jo persisted
in being stonyhearted. She (<font color='blue'><b>Jo</b></font>) ought to have made an effort and tried to
love him (<font color='blue'><b>fellow</b></font>). It couldn't be very hard, many people would be proud and
glad to have such a dear boy care for them. But Jo never would act
like other girls, so there was nothing to do but be very kind and treat
him (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>) like a brother.

<p/>If all brothers were treated as well as Laurie was at this period, they
would be a much happier race of beings than they are. Amy never
lectured now. She (<font color='blue'><b>Amy</b></font>) asked his (<font color='blue'><b>Laurie</b></font>) opinion on all subjects, she (<font color='blue'><b>Amy</b></font>) was
interested in everything he (<font color='blue'><b>Laurie</b></font>) did, made charming little presents for him (<font color='blue'><b>Laurie</b></font>),
and sent him (<font color='blue'><b>Laurie</b></font>) two letters a week, full of lively gossip, sisterly
confidences, and captivating sketches of the lovely scenes about her (<font color='blue'><b>Amy</b></font>).
As few brothers are complimented by having their letters carried about
in their sister's pockets, read and reread diligently, cried over when
short, kissed when long, and treasured carefully, we will not hint that
Amy did any of these fond and foolish things. But she (<font color='blue'><b>Amy</b></font>) certainly did
grow a little pale and pensive that spring, lost much of her (<font color='blue'><b>Amy</b></font>) relish for
society, and went out sketching alone a good deal. She (<font color='blue'><b>Amy</b></font>) never had much
to show when she (<font color='blue'><b>Amy</b></font>) came home, but was studying nature, I dare say, while
she (<font color='blue'><b>Amy</b></font>) sat for hours, with her (<font color='blue'><b>Amy</b></font>) hands folded, on the terrace at Valrosa, or
absently sketched any fancy that occurred to her (<font color='blue'><b>Amy</b></font>), a stalwart knight
carved on a tomb, a young man asleep in the grass, with his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) hat over
his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) eyes, or a curly haired girl in gorgeous array, promenading down a
ballroom on the arm of a tall gentleman, both faces being left a blur
according to the last fashion in art, which was safe but not altogether
satisfactory.

<p/>Her (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) aunt thought that she (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) regretted her (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) answer to Fred, and finding
denials useless and explanations impossible, Amy left her (<font color='blue'><b>Amy</b></font>) to think what
she (<font color='blue'><b>Amy</b></font>) liked, taking care that Laurie should know that Fred had gone to
Egypt. That was all, but he (<font color='blue'><b>Fred</b></font>) understood it, and looked relieved, as he (<font color='blue'><b>Fred</b></font>)
said to himself, with a venerable air...

<p/><div class="bookquote">``I was sure she (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) would think better of it. Poor old fellow! I've been
through it all, and I can sympathize.''

 (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div><p/>With that he (<font color='blue'><b>Fred</b></font>) heaved a great sigh, and then, as if he (<font color='blue'><b>Fred</b></font>) had discharged his (<font color='blue'><b>Fred</b></font>)
duty to the past, put his (<font color='blue'><b>Fred</b></font>) feet up on the sofa and enjoyed Amy's letter
luxuriously.

<p/>While these changes were going on abroad, trouble had come at home.
But the letter telling that Beth was failing never reached Amy, and
when the next found her (<font color='blue'><b>Amy</b></font>) at Vevay, for the heat had driven them from
Nice in May, and they had travelled slowly to Switzerland, by way of
Genoa and the Italian lakes. She (<font color='blue'><b>Amy</b></font>) bore it very well, and quietly
submitted to the family decree that she (<font color='blue'><b>Amy</b></font>) should not shorten her (<font color='blue'><b>Amy</b></font>) visit,
for since it was too late to say goodbye to Beth, she (<font color='blue'><b>Beth</b></font>) had better stay,
and let absence soften her (<font color='blue'><b>Beth</b></font>) sorrow. But her (<font color='blue'><b>Beth</b></font>) heart was very heavy, she (<font color='blue'><b>Beth</b></font>)
longed to be at home, and every day looked wistfully across the lake,
waiting for Laurie to come and comfort her (<font color='blue'><b>Beth</b></font>).

<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Laurie</b></font>) did come very soon, for the same mail brought letters to them both,
but he (<font color='blue'><b>Laurie</b></font>) was in Germany, and it took some days to reach him (<font color='blue'><b>Laurie</b></font>). The moment
he (<font color='blue'><b>Laurie</b></font>) read it, he (<font color='blue'><b>Laurie</b></font>) packed his (<font color='blue'><b>Laurie</b></font>) knapsack, bade adieu to his (<font color='blue'><b>Laurie</b></font>) fellow
pedestrians, and was off to keep his (<font color='blue'><b>Laurie</b></font>) promise, with a heart full of joy
and sorrow, hope and suspense.

<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Laurie</b></font>) knew Vevay well, and as soon as the boat touched the little quay, he (<font color='blue'><b>Laurie</b></font>)
hurried along the shore to La Tour, where the Carrols were living en
pension. The garcon was in despair that the whole family had gone to
take a promenade on the lake, but no, the blonde mademoiselle might be
in the chateau garden. If monsieur would give himself the pain of
sitting down, a flash of time should present her (<font color='blue'><b>Laurie</b></font>). But monsieur could
not wait even a `flash of time', and in the middle of the speech
departed to find mademoiselle himself.

<p/>A pleasant old garden on the borders of the lovely lake, with chestnuts
rustling overhead, ivy climbing everywhere, and the black shadow of the
tower falling far across the sunny water. At one corner of the wide,
low wall was a seat, and here Amy often came to read or work, or
console herself with the beauty all about her (<font color='blue'><b>Amy</b></font>). She (<font color='blue'><b>Amy</b></font>) was sitting here
that day, leaning her (<font color='blue'><b>Amy</b></font>) head on her (<font color='blue'><b>Amy</b></font>) hand, with a homesick heart and heavy
eyes, thinking of Beth and wondering why Laurie did not come. She (<font color='blue'><b>Beth</b></font>) did
not hear him (<font color='blue'><b>Laurie</b></font>) cross the courtyard beyond, nor see him (<font color='blue'><b>Laurie</b></font>) pause in the
archway that led from the subterranean path into the garden. He (<font color='blue'><b>Laurie</b></font>) stood
a minute looking at her (<font color='blue'><b>Beth</b></font>) with new eyes, seeing what no one had ever seen
before, the tender side of Amy's character. Everything about her (<font color='blue'><b>Amy</b></font>) mutely
suggested love and sorrow, the blotted letters in her (<font color='blue'><b>Amy</b></font>) lap, the black
ribbon that tied up her (<font color='blue'><b>Amy</b></font>) hair, the womanly pain and patience in her (<font color='blue'><b>Amy</b></font>)
face, even the little ebony cross at her (<font color='blue'><b>Amy</b></font>) throat seemed pathetic to
Laurie, for he (<font color='blue'><b>Laurie</b></font>) had given it to her (<font color='blue'><b>Amy</b></font>), and she (<font color='blue'><b>Amy</b></font>) wore it as her (<font color='blue'><b>Amy</b></font>) only
ornament. If he (<font color='blue'><b>Laurie</b></font>) had any doubts about the reception she (<font color='blue'><b>Amy</b></font>) would give him (<font color='blue'><b>Laurie</b></font>),
they were set at rest the minute she (<font color='blue'><b>Amy</b></font>) looked up and saw him (<font color='blue'><b>Laurie</b></font>), for
dropping everything, she (<font color='blue'><b>Amy</b></font>) ran to him (<font color='blue'><b>Laurie</b></font>), exclaiming in a tone of
unmistakable love and longing...

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Oh, Laurie, Laurie, I knew you'd come to me!''

 (<font color='red'><b>him</b></font>)</div><p/>I think everything was said and settled then, for as they stood
together quite silent for a moment, with the dark head bent down
protectingly over the light one, Amy felt that no one could comfort and
sustain her (<font color='blue'><b>Amy</b></font>) so well as Laurie, and Laurie decided that Amy was the only
woman in the world who could fill Jo's place and make him (<font color='blue'><b>Laurie</b></font>) happy. He (<font color='blue'><b>Laurie</b></font>)
did not tell her (<font color='blue'><b>Amy</b></font>) so, but she (<font color='blue'><b>Amy</b></font>) was not disappointed, for both felt the
truth, were satisfied, and gladly left the rest to silence.

<p/>In a minute Amy went back to her (<font color='blue'><b>Amy</b></font>) place, and while she (<font color='blue'><b>Amy</b></font>) dried her (<font color='blue'><b>Amy</b></font>) tears,
Laurie gathered up the scattered papers, finding in the sight of sundry
well-worn letters and suggestive sketches good omens for the future.
As he (<font color='blue'><b>Laurie</b></font>) sat down beside her (<font color='blue'><b>Amy</b></font>), Amy felt shy again, and turned rosy red at
the recollection of her (<font color='blue'><b>Amy</b></font>) impulsive greeting.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``I couldn't help it, I felt so lonely and sad, and was so very glad to
see you. It was such a surprise to look up and find you, just as I was
beginning to fear you wouldn't come,''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Amy</b></font>) said, trying in vain to speak
quite naturally.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``I came the minute I heard. I wish I could say something to comfort
you for the loss of dear little Beth, but I can only feel, and...''  (<font color='red'><b>He</b></font>)</div>He (<font color='blue'><b>Laurie</b></font>)
could not get any further, for he (<font color='blue'><b>Laurie</b></font>) too turned bashful all of a sudden,
and did not quite know what to say. He (<font color='blue'><b>Laurie</b></font>) longed to lay Amy's head down
on his (<font color='blue'><b>Laurie</b></font>) shoulder, and tell her (<font color='blue'><b>Amy</b></font>) to have a good cry, but he (<font color='blue'><b>Laurie</b></font>) did not dare,
so took her (<font color='blue'><b>Amy</b></font>) hand instead, and gave it a sympathetic squeeze that was
better than words.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``You needn't say anything, this comforts me,''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Amy</b></font>) said softly. <div class="bookquote">``Beth
is well and happy, and I mustn't wish her (<font color='blue'><b>Beth</b></font>) back, but I dread the going
home, much as I long to see them all. We won't talk about it now, for
it makes me cry, and I want to enjoy you while you stay. You needn't
go right back, need you?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Not if you want me, dear.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I do, so much. Aunt and Flo are very kind, but you seem like one of
the family, and it would be so comfortable to have you for a little
while.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Amy/Amy March</b></font>)</div><p/>Amy spoke and looked so like a homesick child whose heart was full that
Laurie forgot his (<font color='blue'><b>Laurie</b></font>) bashfulness all at once, and gave her (<font color='blue'><b>Amy</b></font>) just what she (<font color='blue'><b>Amy</b></font>)
wanted--the petting she (<font color='blue'><b>Amy</b></font>) was used to and the cheerful conversation she (<font color='blue'><b>Amy</b></font>)
needed.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Poor little soul, you look as if you'd grieved yourself half sick!
I'm going to take care of you, so don't cry any more, but come and walk
about with me, the wind is too chilly for you to sit still,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Laurie</b></font>) said,
in the half-caressing, half-commanding way that Amy liked, as he (<font color='blue'><b>Laurie</b></font>) tied
on her (<font color='blue'><b>Amy</b></font>) hat, drew her (<font color='blue'><b>Amy</b></font>) arm through his (<font color='blue'><b>Laurie</b></font>), and began to pace up and down the
sunny walk under the new-leaved chestnuts. He (<font color='blue'><b>Laurie</b></font>) felt more at ease upon
his (<font color='blue'><b>Laurie</b></font>) legs, and Amy found it pleasant to have a strong arm to lean upon,
a familiar face to smile at her (<font color='blue'><b>Amy</b></font>), and a kind voice to talk delightfully
for her (<font color='blue'><b>Amy</b></font>) alone.

<p/>The quaint old garden had sheltered many pairs of lovers, and seemed
expressly made for them, so sunny and secluded was it, with nothing but
the tower to overlook them, and the wide lake to carry away the echo of
their words, as it rippled by below. For an hour this new pair walked
and talked, or rested on the wall, enjoying the sweet influences which
gave such a charm to time and place, and when an unromantic dinner bell
warned them away, Amy felt as if she (<font color='blue'><b>Amy</b></font>) left her (<font color='blue'><b>Amy</b></font>) burden of loneliness and
sorrow behind her (<font color='blue'><b>Amy</b></font>) in the chateau garden.

<p/>The moment Mrs. Carrol saw the girl's altered face, she (<font color='blue'><b>Carrol</b></font>) was illuminated
with a new idea, and exclaimed to herself, <div class="bookquote">``Now I understand it
all--the child has been pining for young Laurence. Bless my heart, I
never thought of such a thing!''

 (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div><p/>With praiseworthy discretion, the good lady said nothing, and betrayed
no sign of enlightenment, but cordially urged Laurie to stay and begged
Amy to enjoy his (<font color='blue'><b>Laurie</b></font>) society, for it would do her (<font color='blue'><b>Amy</b></font>) more good than so much
solitude. Amy was a model of docility, and as her (<font color='blue'><b>Amy</b></font>) aunt was a good deal
occupied with Flo, she (<font color='blue'><b>Amy</b></font>) was left to entertain her (<font color='blue'><b>Amy</b></font>) friend, and did it
with more than her (<font color='blue'><b>Amy</b></font>) usual success.

<p/>At Nice, Laurie had lounged and Amy had scolded. At Vevay, Laurie was
never idle, but always walking, riding, boating, or studying in the
most energetic manner, while Amy admired everything he (<font color='blue'><b>Laurie</b></font>) did and followed
his (<font color='blue'><b>Laurie</b></font>) example as far and as fast as she (<font color='blue'><b>Amy</b></font>) could. He (<font color='blue'><b>Laurie</b></font>) said the change was
owing to the climate, and she (<font color='blue'><b>Amy</b></font>) did not contradict him (<font color='blue'><b>Laurie</b></font>), being glad of a
like excuse for her (<font color='blue'><b>Amy</b></font>) own recovered health and spirits.

<p/>The invigorating air did them both good, and much exercise worked
wholesome changes in minds as well as bodies. They seemed to get
clearer views of life and duty up there among the everlasting hills.
The fresh winds blew away desponding doubts, delusive fancies, and
moody mists. The warm spring sunshine brought out all sorts of
aspiring ideas, tender hopes, and happy thoughts. The lake seemed to
wash away the troubles of the past, and the grand old mountains to look
benignly down upon them saying, <div class="bookquote">``Little children, love one another.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Laurie/Mr. Laurie/LAURIE</b></font>)</div><p/>In spite of the new sorrow, it was a very happy time, so happy that
Laurie could not bear to disturb it by a word. It took him (<font color='blue'><b>Laurie</b></font>) a little
while to recover from his (<font color='blue'><b>Laurie</b></font>) surprise at the cure of his (<font color='blue'><b>Laurie</b></font>) first, and as he (<font color='blue'><b>Laurie</b></font>)
had firmly believed, his (<font color='blue'><b>Laurie</b></font>) last and only love. He (<font color='blue'><b>Laurie</b></font>) consoled himself for
the seeming disloyalty by the thought that Jo's sister was almost the
same as Jo's self, and the conviction that it would have been
impossible to love any other woman but Amy so soon and so well. His (<font color='blue'><b>Laurie</b></font>)
first wooing had been of the tempestuous order, and he (<font color='blue'><b>Laurie</b></font>) looked back upon
it as if through a long vista of years with a feeling of compassion
blended with regret. He (<font color='blue'><b>Laurie</b></font>) was not ashamed of it, but put it away as one
of the bitter-sweet experiences of his (<font color='blue'><b>Laurie</b></font>) life, for which he (<font color='blue'><b>Laurie</b></font>) could be
grateful when the pain was over. His (<font color='blue'><b>Laurie</b></font>) second wooing, he (<font color='blue'><b>Laurie</b></font>) resolved, should
be as calm and simple as possible. There was no need of having a
scene, hardly any need of telling Amy that he (<font color='blue'><b>Laurie</b></font>) loved her (<font color='blue'><b>Amy</b></font>), she (<font color='blue'><b>Amy</b></font>) knew it
without words and had given him (<font color='blue'><b>Laurie</b></font>) his (<font color='blue'><b>Laurie</b></font>) answer long ago. It all came about
so naturally that no one could complain, and he (<font color='blue'><b>Laurie</b></font>) knew that everybody
would be pleased, even Jo. But when our first little passion has been
crushed, we are apt to be wary and slow in making a second trial, so
Laurie let the days pass, enjoying every hour, and leaving to chance
the utterance of the word that would put an end to the first and
sweetest part of his (<font color='blue'><b>Laurie</b></font>) new romance.

<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Laurie</b></font>) had rather imagined that the denoument would take place in the
chateau garden by moonlight, and in the most graceful and decorous
manner, but it turned out exactly the reverse, for the matter was
settled on the lake at noonday in a few blunt words. They had been
floating about all the morning, from gloomy St. Gingolf to sunny
Montreux, with the Alps of Savoy on one side, Mont St. Bernard and the
Dent du Midi on the other, pretty Vevay in the valley, and Lausanne
upon the hill beyond, a cloudless blue sky overhead, and the bluer lake
below, dotted with the picturesque boats that look like white-winged
gulls.

<p/>They had been talking of Bonnivard, as they glided past Chillon, and of
Rousseau, as they looked up at Clarens, where he (<font color='blue'><b>Rousseau</b></font>) wrote his (<font color='blue'><b>Rousseau</b></font>) Heloise.
Neither had read it, but they knew it was a love story, and each
privately wondered if it was half as interesting as their own. Amy had
been dabbling her (<font color='blue'><b>Amy</b></font>) hand in the water during the little pause that fell
between them, and when she (<font color='blue'><b>Amy</b></font>) looked up, Laurie was leaning on his (<font color='blue'><b>Laurie</b></font>) oars
with an expression in his (<font color='blue'><b>Laurie</b></font>) eyes that made her (<font color='blue'><b>Amy</b></font>) say hastily, merely for
the sake of saying something...

<p/><div class="bookquote">``You must be tired. Rest a little, and let me row. It will do me
good, for since you came I have been altogether lazy and luxurious.''

 (<font color='red'><b>her</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I'm not tired, but you may take an oar, if you like. There's room
enough, though I have to sit nearly in the middle, else the boat won't
trim,''  (<font color='red'><b>Laurie/Mr. Laurie/LAURIE</b></font>)</div>returned Laurie, as if he (<font color='blue'><b>Laurie</b></font>) rather liked the arrangement.

<p/>Feeling that she (<font color='blue'><b>Amy</b></font>) had not mended matters much, Amy took the offered
third of a seat, shook her (<font color='blue'><b>Amy</b></font>) hair over her (<font color='blue'><b>Amy</b></font>) face, and accepted an oar.
She (<font color='blue'><b>Amy</b></font>) rowed as well as she (<font color='blue'><b>Amy</b></font>) did many other things, and though she (<font color='blue'><b>Amy</b></font>) used
both hands, and Laurie but one, the oars kept time, and the boat went
smoothly through the water.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``How well we pull together, don't we?''  (<font color='red'><b>Amy/Amy March</b></font>)</div>said Amy, who objected to
silence just then.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``So well that I wish we might always pull in the same boat. Will you,
Amy?''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>very tenderly.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Yes, Laurie,''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>very low.

<p/>Then they both stopped rowing, and unconsciously added a pretty little
tableau of human love and happiness to the dissolving views reflected
in the lake.



<p/>CHAPTER FORTY-TWO

<p/>ALL ALONE

<p/>It was easy to promise self-abnegation when self was wrapped up in
another, and heart and soul were purified by a sweet example. But when
the helpful voice was silent, the daily lesson over, the beloved
presence gone, and nothing remained but loneliness and grief, then Jo
found her (<font color='blue'><b>Jo</b></font>) promise very hard to keep. How could she (<font color='blue'><b>Jo</b></font>) `comfort Father and
Mother' when her (<font color='blue'><b>Jo</b></font>) own heart ached with a ceaseless longing for her (<font color='blue'><b>Jo</b></font>)
sister, how could she (<font color='blue'><b>Jo</b></font>) `make the house cheerful' when all its light and
warmth and beauty seemed to have deserted it when Beth left the old
home for the new, and where in all the world could she (<font color='blue'><b>Beth</b></font>) `find some
useful, happy work to do', that would take the place of the loving
service which had been its own reward? She (<font color='blue'><b>Beth</b></font>) tried in a blind, hopeless
way to do her (<font color='blue'><b>Beth</b></font>) duty, secretly rebelling against it all the while, for it
seemed unjust that her (<font color='blue'><b>Beth</b></font>) few joys should be lessened, her (<font color='blue'><b>Beth</b></font>) burdens made
heavier, and life get harder and harder as she (<font color='blue'><b>Beth</b></font>) toiled along. Some
people seemed to get all sunshine, and some all shadow. It was not
fair, for she (<font color='blue'><b>Beth</b></font>) tried more than Amy to be good, but never got any reward,
only disappointment, trouble and hard work.

<p/>Poor Jo, these were dark days to her (<font color='blue'><b>Jo</b></font>), for something like despair came
over her (<font color='blue'><b>Jo</b></font>) when she (<font color='blue'><b>Jo</b></font>) thought of spending all her (<font color='blue'><b>Jo</b></font>) life in that quiet house,
devoted to humdrum cares, a few small pleasures, and the duty that
never seemed to grow any easier. <div class="bookquote">``I can't do it. I wasn't meant for a
life like this, and I know I shall break away and do something
desperate if somebody doesn't come and help me,''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Jo</b></font>) said to herself,
when her (<font color='blue'><b>Jo</b></font>) first efforts failed and she (<font color='blue'><b>Jo</b></font>) fell into the moody, miserable
state of mind which often comes when strong wills have to yield to the
inevitable.

<p/>But someone did come and help her (<font color='blue'><b>Jo</b></font>), though Jo did not recognize her (<font color='blue'><b>Jo</b></font>) good
angels at once because they wore familiar shapes and used the simple
spells best fitted to poor humanity. Often she (<font color='blue'><b>Jo</b></font>) started up at night,
thinking Beth called her (<font color='blue'><b>Beth</b></font>), and when the sight of the little empty bed
made her (<font color='blue'><b>Beth</b></font>) cry with the bitter cry of unsubmissive sorrow, <div class="bookquote">``Oh, Beth,
come back! Come back!''  (<font color='red'><b>her</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Beth</b></font>) did not stretch out her (<font color='blue'><b>Beth</b></font>) yearning arms in
vain. For, as quick to hear her (<font color='blue'><b>Beth</b></font>) sobbing as she (<font color='blue'><b>Beth</b></font>) had been to hear her (<font color='blue'><b>Beth</b></font>)
sister's faintest whisper, her (<font color='blue'><b>Beth</b></font>) mother came to comfort her (<font color='blue'><b>Beth</b></font>), not with
words only, but the patient tenderness that soothes by a touch, tears
that were mute reminders of a greater grief than Jo's, and broken
whispers, more eloquent than prayers, because hopeful resignation went
hand-in-hand with natural sorrow. Sacred moments, when heart talked to
heart in the silence of the night, turning affliction to a blessing,
which chastened grief and strengthened love. Feeling this, Jo's burden
seemed easier to bear, duty grew sweeter, and life looked more
endurable, seen from the safe shelter of her (<font color='blue'><b>Jo</b></font>) mother's arms.

<p/>When aching heart was a little comforted, troubled mind likewise found
help, for one day she (<font color='blue'><b>Jo</b></font>) went to the study, and leaning over the good gray
head lifted to welcome her (<font color='blue'><b>Jo</b></font>) with a tranquil smile, she (<font color='blue'><b>Jo</b></font>) said very humbly,
<div class="bookquote">``Father, talk to me as you did to Beth. I need it more than she (<font color='blue'><b>Beth</b></font>) did,
for I'm all wrong.''

 (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``My dear, nothing can comfort me like this,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Jo</b></font>) answered, with a falter
in his (<font color='blue'><b>Jo</b></font>) voice, and both arms round her (<font color='blue'><b>Jo</b></font>), as if he (<font color='blue'><b>Jo</b></font>) too, needed help, and
did not fear to ask for it.

<p/>Then, sitting in Beth's little chair close beside him (<font color='blue'><b>Jo</b></font>), Jo told her (<font color='blue'><b>Jo</b></font>)
troubles, the resentful sorrow for her (<font color='blue'><b>Jo</b></font>) loss, the fruitless efforts that
discouraged her (<font color='blue'><b>Jo</b></font>), the want of faith that made life look so dark, and all
the sad bewilderment which we call despair. She (<font color='blue'><b>Jo</b></font>) gave him (<font color='blue'><b>Jo</b></font>) entire
confidence, he (<font color='blue'><b>Jo</b></font>) gave her (<font color='blue'><b>Jo</b></font>) the help she (<font color='blue'><b>Jo</b></font>) needed, and both found consolation
in the act. For the time had come when they could talk together not
only as father and daughter, but as man and woman, able and glad to
serve each other with mutual sympathy as well as mutual love. Happy,
thoughtful times there in the old study which Jo called `the church of
one member', and from which she (<font color='blue'><b>Jo</b></font>) came with fresh courage, recovered
cheerfulness, and a more submissive spirit. For the parents who had
taught one child to meet death without fear, were trying now to teach
another to accept life without despondency or distrust, and to use its
beautiful opportunities with gratitude and power.

<p/>Other helps had Jo--humble, wholesome duties and delights that would
not be denied their part in serving her (<font color='blue'><b>Jo</b></font>), and which she (<font color='blue'><b>Jo</b></font>) slowly learned
to see and value. Brooms and dishcloths never could be as distasteful
as they once had been, for Beth had presided over both, and something
of her (<font color='blue'><b>Beth</b></font>) housewifely spirit seemed to linger around the little mop and
the old brush, never thrown away. As she (<font color='blue'><b>Beth</b></font>) used them, Jo found herself
humming the songs Beth used to hum, imitating Beth's orderly ways, and
giving the little touches here and there that kept everything fresh and
cozy, which was the first step toward making home happy, though she (<font color='blue'><b>Beth</b></font>)
didn't know it till Hannah said with an approving squeeze of the hand...

<p/><div class="bookquote">``You thoughtful creeter, you're determined we shan't miss that dear
lamb ef you can help it. We don't say much, but we see it, and the
Lord will bless you for`t, see ef He (<font color='blue'><b>Lord</b></font>) don't.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Hannah</b></font>)</div><p/>As they sat sewing together, Jo discovered how much improved her (<font color='blue'><b>Jo</b></font>) sister
Meg was, how well she (<font color='blue'><b>Jo</b></font>) could talk, how much she (<font color='blue'><b>Jo</b></font>) knew about good, womanly
impulses, thoughts, and feelings, how happy she (<font color='blue'><b>Jo</b></font>) was in husband and
children, and how much they were all doing for each other.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Marriage is an excellent thing, after all. I wonder if I should
blossom out half as well as you have, if I tried it?, always
_`perwisin'_ I could,''  (<font color='red'><b>Jo/Miss Jo/JO</b></font>)</div>said Jo, as she (<font color='blue'><b>Jo</b></font>) constructed a kite for Demi in
the topsy-turvy nursery.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``It's just what you need to bring out the tender womanly half of your
nature, Jo. You are like a chestnut burr, prickly outside, but
silky-soft within, and a sweet kernal, if one can only get at it. Love
will make you show your heart one day, and then the rough burr will
fall off.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Frost opens chestnut burrs, ma'am, and it takes a good shake to bring
them down. Boys go nutting, and I don't care to be bagged by them,''
 (<font color='red'><b>Jo/Miss Jo/JO</b></font>)</div>returned Jo, pasting away at the kite which no wind that blows would
ever carry up, for Daisy had tied herself on as a bob.

<p/>Meg laughed, for she (<font color='blue'><b>Meg</b></font>) was glad to see a glimmer of Jo's old spirit, but
she (<font color='blue'><b>Jo</b></font>) felt it her (<font color='blue'><b>Jo</b></font>) duty to enforce her (<font color='blue'><b>Jo</b></font>) opinion by every argument in her (<font color='blue'><b>Jo</b></font>)
power, and the sisterly chats were not wasted, especially as two of
Meg's most effective arguments were the babies, whom Jo loved tenderly.
Grief is the best opener of some hearts, and Jo's was nearly ready for
the bag. A little more sunshine to ripen the nut, then, not a boy's
impatient shake, but a man's hand reached up to pick it gently from the
burr, and find the kernal sound and sweet. If she (<font color='blue'><b>Jo</b></font>) suspected this, she (<font color='blue'><b>Jo</b></font>)
would have shut up tight, and been more prickly than ever, fortunately
she (<font color='blue'><b>Jo</b></font>) wasn't thinking about herself, so when the time came, down she (<font color='blue'><b>Jo</b></font>)
dropped.

<p/>Now, if she (<font color='blue'><b>Jo</b></font>) had been the heroine of a moral storybook, she (<font color='blue'><b>Jo</b></font>) ought at
this period of her (<font color='blue'><b>Jo</b></font>) life to have become quite saintly, renounced the
world, and gone about doing good in a mortified bonnet, with tracts in
her (<font color='blue'><b>Jo</b></font>) pocket. But, you see, Jo wasn't a heroine, she (<font color='blue'><b>Jo</b></font>) was only a
struggling human girl like hundreds of others, and she (<font color='blue'><b>Jo</b></font>) just acted out
her (<font color='blue'><b>Jo</b></font>) nature, being sad, cross, listless, or energetic, as the mood
suggested. It's highly virtuous to say we'll be good, but we can't do
it all at once, and it takes a long pull, a strong pull, and a pull all
together before some of us even get our feet set in the right way. Jo
had got so far, she (<font color='blue'><b>Jo</b></font>) was learning to do her (<font color='blue'><b>Jo</b></font>) duty, and to feel unhappy if
she (<font color='blue'><b>Jo</b></font>) did not, but to do it cheerfully, ah, that was another thing! She (<font color='blue'><b>Jo</b></font>)
had often said she (<font color='blue'><b>Jo</b></font>) wanted to do something splendid, no matter how hard,
and now she (<font color='blue'><b>Jo</b></font>) had her (<font color='blue'><b>Jo</b></font>) wish, for what could be more beautiful than to
devote her (<font color='blue'><b>Jo</b></font>) life to Father and Mother, trying to make home as happy to
them as they had to her (<font color='blue'><b>Jo</b></font>)? And if difficulties were necessary to
increase the splendor of the effort, what could be harder for a
restless, ambitious girl than to give up her (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) own hopes, plans, and
desires, and cheerfully live for others?

<p/>Providence had taken her (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) at her (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) word. Here was the task, not what she (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>)
had expected, but better because self had no part in it. Now, could she (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>)
do it? She (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) decided that she (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) would try, and in her (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) first attempt she (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>)
found the helps I have suggested. Still another was given her (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>), and she (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>)
took it, not as a reward, but as a comfort, as Christian took the
refreshment afforded by the little arbor where he (<font color='blue'><b>Christian</b></font>) rested, as he (<font color='blue'><b>Christian</b></font>) climbed
the hill called Difficulty.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Why don't you write? That always used to make you happy,''  (<font color='red'><b>mother</b></font>)</div>said her (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>)
mother once, when the desponding fit over-shadowed Jo.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``I've no heart to write, and if I had, nobody cares for my things.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``We do. Write something for us, and never mind the rest of the world.
Try it, dear. I'm sure it would do you good, and please us very much.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Don't believe I can.''  (<font color='red'><b>Jo/Miss Jo/JO</b></font>)</div>But Jo got out her (<font color='blue'><b>Jo</b></font>) desk and began to overhaul
her (<font color='blue'><b>Jo</b></font>) half-finished manuscripts.

<p/>An hour afterward her (<font color='blue'><b>Jo</b></font>) mother peeped in and there she (<font color='blue'><b>Jo</b></font>) was, scratching
away, with her (<font color='blue'><b>Jo</b></font>) black pinafore on, and an absorbed expression, which
caused Mrs. March to smile and slip away, well pleased with the success
of her (<font color='blue'><b>Jo</b></font>) suggestion. Jo never knew how it happened, but something got
into that story that went straight to the hearts of those who read it,
for when her (<font color='blue'><b>Jo</b></font>) family had laughed and cried over it, her (<font color='blue'><b>Jo</b></font>) father sent it,
much against her (<font color='blue'><b>Jo</b></font>) will, to one of the popular magazines, and to her (<font color='blue'><b>Jo</b></font>)
utter surprise, it was not only paid for, but others requested.
Letters from several persons, whose praise was honor, followed the
appearance of the little story, newspapers copied it, and strangers as
well as friends admired it. For a small thing it was a great success,
and Jo was more astonished than when her (<font color='blue'><b>Jo</b></font>) novel was commended and
condemned all at once.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``I don't understand it. What can there be in a simple little story
like that to make people praise it so?''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Jo</b></font>) said, quite bewildered.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``There is truth in it, Jo, that's the secret. Humor and pathos make it
alive, and you have found your style at last. You wrote with no
thoughts of fame and money, and put your heart into it, my daughter.
You have had the bitter, now comes the sweet. Do your best, and grow
as happy as we are in your success.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``If there is anything good or true in what I write, it isn't mine. I
owe it all to you and Mother and Beth,''  (<font color='red'><b>Jo/Miss Jo/JO</b></font>)</div>said Jo, more touched by her (<font color='blue'><b>Jo</b></font>)
father's words than by any amount of praise from the world.

<p/>So taught by love and sorrow, Jo wrote her (<font color='blue'><b>Jo</b></font>) little stories, and sent
them away to make friends for themselves and her (<font color='blue'><b>Jo</b></font>), finding it a very
charitable world to such humble wanderers, for they were kindly
welcomed, and sent home comfortable tokens to their mother, like
dutiful children whom good fortune overtakes.

<p/>When Amy and Laurie wrote of their engagement, Mrs. March feared that
Jo would find it difficult to rejoice over it, but her (<font color='blue'><b>Jo</b></font>) fears were soon
set at rest, for though Jo looked grave at first, she (<font color='blue'><b>Jo</b></font>) took it very
quietly, and was full of hopes and plans for `the children' before she (<font color='blue'><b>Jo</b></font>)
read the letter twice. It was a sort of written duet, wherein each
glorified the other in loverlike fashion, very pleasant to read and
satisfactory to think of, for no one had any objection to make.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``You like it, Mother?''  (<font color='red'><b>Jo/Miss Jo/JO</b></font>)</div>said Jo, as they laid down the closely written
sheets and looked at one another.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Yes, I hoped it would be so, ever since Amy wrote that she (<font color='blue'><b>Amy</b></font>) had refused
Fred. I felt sure then that something better than what you call the
`mercenary spirit' had come over her (<font color='blue'><b>Amy</b></font>), and a hint here and there in her (<font color='blue'><b>Amy</b></font>)
letters made me suspect that love and Laurie would win the day.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``How sharp you are, Marmee, and how silent! You never said a word to
me.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Mothers have need of sharp eyes and discreet tongues when they have
girls to manage. I was half afraid to put the idea into your head,
lest you should write and congratulate them before the thing was
settled.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I'm not the scatterbrain I was. You may trust me. I'm sober and
sensible enough for anyone's confidante now.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``So you are, my dear, and I should have made you mine, only I fancied
it might pain you to learn that your Teddy loved someone else.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Now, Mother, did you really think I could be so silly and selfish,
after I'd refused his (<font color='blue'><b>Teddy</b></font>) love, when it was freshest, if not best?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I knew you were sincere then, Jo, but lately I have thought that if he (<font color='blue'><b>Teddy</b></font>)
came back, and asked again, you might perhaps, feel like giving another
answer. Forgive me, dear, I can't help seeing that you are very
lonely, and sometimes there is a hungry look in your eyes that goes to
my heart. So I fancied that your boy might fill the empty place if he (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>)
tried now.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/>``No, Mother, it is better as it is, and I'm glad Amy has learned to
love him (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>). But you are right in one thing. I am lonely, and perhaps if
Teddy had tried again, I might have said <div class="bookquote">``Yes', not because I love him (<font color='blue'><b>Teddy</b></font>)
any more, but because I care more to be loved than when he (<font color='blue'><b>Teddy</b></font>) went away.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I'm glad of that, Jo, for it shows that you are getting on. There are
plenty to love you, so try to be satisfied with Father and Mother,
sisters and brothers, friends and babies, till the best lover of all
comes to give you your reward.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Mothers are the best lovers in the world, but I don't mind whispering
to Marmee that I'd like to try all kinds. It's very curious, but the
more I try to satisfy myself with all sorts of natural affections, the
more I seem to want. I'd no idea hearts could take in so many. Mine
is so elastic, it never seems full now, and I used to be quite
contented with my family. I don't understand it.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I do,''  (<font color='red'><b>Jo/Miss Jo/JO</b></font>)</div>and Mrs. March smiled her (<font color='blue'><b>Jo</b></font>) wise smile, as Jo turned back the
leaves to read what Amy said of Laurie.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``It is so beautiful to be loved as Laurie loves me. He (<font color='blue'><b>Laurie</b></font>) isn't
sentimental, doesn't say much about it, but I see and feel it in all he (<font color='blue'><b>Laurie</b></font>)
says and does, and it makes me so happy and so humble that I don't seem
to be the same girl I was. I never knew how good and generous and
tender he (<font color='blue'><b>Laurie</b></font>) was till now, for he (<font color='blue'><b>Laurie</b></font>) lets me read his (<font color='blue'><b>Laurie</b></font>) heart, and I find it
full of noble impulses and hopes and purposes, and am so proud to know
it's mine. He (<font color='blue'><b>Laurie</b></font>) says he (<font color='blue'><b>Laurie</b></font>) feels as if he (<font color='blue'><b>Laurie</b></font>) `could make a prosperous voyage
now with me aboard as mate, and lots of love for ballast'. I pray he (<font color='blue'><b>Laurie</b></font>)
may, and try to be all he (<font color='blue'><b>Laurie</b></font>) believes me, for I love my gallant captain
with all my heart and soul and might, and never will desert him (<font color='blue'><b>Laurie</b></font>), while
God lets us be together. Oh, Mother, I never knew how much like heaven
this world could be, when two people love and live for one another!''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``And that's our cool, reserved, and worldly Amy! Truly, love does work
miracles. How very, very happy they must be!''  (<font color='red'><b>Jo/Miss Jo/JO</b></font>)</div>and Jo laid the rustling
sheets together with a careful hand, as one might shut the covers of a
lovely romance, which holds the reader fast till the end comes, and he (<font color='blue'><b>reader</b></font>)
finds himself alone in the workaday world again.

<p/>By-and-by Jo roamed away upstairs, for it was rainy, and she (<font color='blue'><b>Jo</b></font>) could not
walk. A restless spirit possessed her (<font color='blue'><b>Jo</b></font>), and the old feeling came again,
not bitter as it once was, but a sorrowfully patient wonder why one
sister should have all she (<font color='blue'><b>sister</b></font>) asked, the other nothing. It was not true,
she (<font color='blue'><b>sister</b></font>) knew that and tried to put it away, but the natural craving for
affection was strong, and Amy's happiness woke the hungry longing for
someone to `love with heart and soul, and cling to while God let them
be together'. Up in the garret, where Jo's unquiet wanderings ended
stood four little wooden chests in a row, each marked with its owners
name, and each filled with relics of the childhood and girlhood ended
now for all. Jo glanced into them, and when she (<font color='blue'><b>Jo</b></font>) came to her (<font color='blue'><b>Jo</b></font>) own,
leaned her (<font color='blue'><b>Jo</b></font>) chin on the edge, and stared absently at the chaotic
collection, till a bundle of old exercise books caught her (<font color='blue'><b>Jo</b></font>) eye. She (<font color='blue'><b>Jo</b></font>)
drew them out, turned them over, and relived that pleasant winter at
kind Mrs. Kirke's. She (<font color='blue'><b>Kirke</b></font>) had smiled at first, then she (<font color='blue'><b>Kirke</b></font>) looked
thoughtful, next sad, and when she (<font color='blue'><b>Kirke</b></font>) came to a little message written in
the Professor's hand, her (<font color='blue'><b>Kirke</b></font>) lips began to tremble, the books slid out of
her (<font color='blue'><b>Kirke</b></font>) lap, and she (<font color='blue'><b>Kirke</b></font>) sat looking at the friendly words, as they took a new
meaning, and touched a tender spot in her (<font color='blue'><b>Kirke</b></font>) heart.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Wait for me, my friend. I may be a little late, but I shall surely
come.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Oh, if he (<font color='blue'><b>friend</b></font>) only would! So kind, so good, so patient with me always, my
dear old Fritz. I didn't value him (<font color='blue'><b>Fritz</b></font>) half enough when I had him (<font color='blue'><b>Fritz</b></font>), but now
how I should love to see him (<font color='blue'><b>Fritz</b></font>), for everyone seems going away from me,
and I'm all alone.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Jo/Miss Jo/JO</b></font>)</div><p/>And holding the little paper fast, as if it were a promise yet to be
fulfilled, Jo laid her (<font color='blue'><b>Jo</b></font>) head down on a comfortable rag bag, and cried,
as if in opposition to the rain pattering on the roof.

<p/>Was it all self-pity, loneliness, or low spirits? Or was it the waking
up of a sentiment which had bided its time as patiently as its
inspirer? Who shall say?



<p/>CHAPTER FORTY-THREE

<p/>SURPRISES

<p/>Jo was alone in the twilight, lying on the old sofa, looking at the
fire, and thinking. It was her (<font color='blue'><b>Jo</b></font>) favorite way of spending the hour of
dusk. No one disturbed her (<font color='blue'><b>Jo</b></font>), and she (<font color='blue'><b>Jo</b></font>) used to lie there on Beth's little
red pillow, planning stories, dreaming dreams, or thinking tender
thoughts of the sister who never seemed far away. Her (<font color='blue'><b>sister</b></font>) face looked
tired, grave, and rather sad, for tomorrow was her (<font color='blue'><b>sister</b></font>) birthday, and she (<font color='blue'><b>sister</b></font>)
was thinking how fast the years went by, how old she (<font color='blue'><b>sister</b></font>) was getting, and
how little she (<font color='blue'><b>sister</b></font>) seemed to have accomplished. Almost twenty-five, and
nothing to show for it. Jo was mistaken in that. There was a good
deal to show, and by-and-by she (<font color='blue'><b>Jo</b></font>) saw, and was grateful for it.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``An old maid, that's what I'm to be. A literary spinster, with a pen
for a spouse, a family of stories for children, and twenty years hence
a morsel of fame, perhaps, when, like poor Johnson, I'm old and can't
enjoy it, solitary, and can't share it, independent, and don't need it.
Well, I needn't be a sour saint nor a selfish sinner, and, I dare say,
old maids are very comfortable when they get used to it, but...''  (<font color='red'><b>Jo/Miss Jo/JO</b></font>)</div>and
there Jo sighed, as if the prospect was not inviting.

<p/>It seldom is, at first, and thirty seems the end of all things to
five-and-twenty. But it's not as bad as it looks, and one can get on
quite happily if one has something in one's self to fall back upon. At
twenty-five, girls begin to talk about being old maids, but secretly
resolve that they never will be. At thirty they say nothing about it,
but quietly accept the fact, and if sensible, console themselves by
remembering that they have twenty more useful, happy years, in which
they may be learning to grow old gracefully. Don't laugh at the
spinsters, dear girls, for often very tender, tragic romances are
hidden away in the hearts that beat so quietly under the sober gowns,
and many silent sacrifices of youth, health, ambition, love itself,
make the faded faces beautiful in God's sight. Even the sad, sour
sisters should be kindly dealt with, because they have missed the
sweetest part of life, if for no other reason. And looking at them
with compassion, not contempt, girls in their bloom should remember
that they too may miss the blossom time. That rosy cheeks don't last
forever, that silver threads will come in the bonnie brown hair, and
that, by-and-by, kindness and respect will be as sweet as love and
admiration now.

<p/>Gentlemen, which means boys, be courteous to the old maids, no matter
how poor and plain and prim, for the only chivalry worth having is that
which is the readiest to pay deference to the old, protect the feeble,
and serve womankind, regardless of rank, age, or color. Just recollect
the good aunts who have not only lectured and fussed, but nursed and
petted, too often without thanks, the scrapes they have helped you out
of, the tips they have given you from their small store, the stitches
the patient old fingers have set for you, the steps the willing old
feet have taken, and gratefully pay the dear old ladies the little
attentions that women love to receive as long as they live. The
bright-eyed girls are quick to see such traits, and will like you all
the better for them, and if death, almost the only power that can part
mother and son, should rob you of yours, you will be sure to find a
tender welcome and maternal cherishing from some Aunt Priscilla, who
has kept the warmest corner of her (<font color='blue'><b>Priscilla</b></font>) lonely old heart for `the best nevvy
in the world'.

<p/>Jo must have fallen asleep -LRB-as I dare say my reader has during this
little homily-RRB-, for suddenly Laurie's ghost seemed to stand before her (<font color='blue'><b>Jo</b></font>),
a substantial, lifelike ghost, leaning over her (<font color='blue'><b>Jo</b></font>) with the very look he (<font color='blue'><b>Laurie</b></font>)
used to wear when he (<font color='blue'><b>Laurie</b></font>) felt a good deal and didn't like to show it. But,
like Jenny in the ballad...

<p/><div class="bookquote">``She (<font color='blue'><b>spinster</b></font>) could not think it he (<font color='blue'><b>sinner</b></font>),''

 (<font color='red'><b>Jenny/Jenny Snow</b></font>)</div><p/>and lay staring up at him (<font color='blue'><b>Laurie</b></font>) in startled silence, till he (<font color='blue'><b>Laurie</b></font>) stooped and
kissed her (<font color='blue'><b>Jenny</b></font>). Then she (<font color='blue'><b>Jenny</b></font>) knew him (<font color='blue'><b>Laurie</b></font>), and flew up, crying joyfully...

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Oh my Teddy! Oh my Teddy!''

 (<font color='red'><b>him</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Dear Jo, you are glad to see me, then?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Glad! My blessed boy, words can't express my gladness. Where's Amy?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Your mother has got her (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) down at Meg's. We stopped there by the way,
and there was no getting my wife out of their clutches.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Your what?''  (<font color='red'><b>Jo/Miss Jo/JO</b></font>)</div>cried Jo, for Laurie uttered those two words with an
unconscious pride and satisfaction which betrayed him (<font color='blue'><b>Laurie</b></font>).

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Oh, the dickens! Now I've done it,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>and he (<font color='blue'><b>Laurie</b></font>) looked so guilty that Jo
was down on him (<font color='blue'><b>Laurie</b></font>) like a flash.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``You've gone and got married!''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Yes, please, but I never will again,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>and he (<font color='blue'><b>Laurie</b></font>) went down upon his (<font color='blue'><b>Laurie</b></font>) knees,
with a penitent clasping of hands, and a face full of mischief, mirth,
and triumph.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Actually married?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Very much so, thank you.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Mercy on us. What dreadful thing will you do next?''  (<font color='red'><b>Jo/Miss Jo/JO</b></font>)</div>and Jo fell into
her (<font color='blue'><b>Jo</b></font>) seat with a gasp.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``A characteristic, but not exactly complimentary, congratulation,''
 (<font color='red'><b>Laurie/Mr. Laurie/LAURIE</b></font>)</div>returned Laurie, still in an abject attitude, but beaming with
satisfaction.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``What can you expect, when you take one's breath away, creeping in like
a burglar, and letting cats out of bags like that? Get up, you
ridiculous boy, and tell me all about it.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Not a word, unless you let me come in my old place, and promise not to
barricade.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Jo/Miss Jo/JO</b></font>)</div><p/>Jo laughed at that as she (<font color='blue'><b>Jo</b></font>) had not done for many a long day, and patted
the sofa invitingly, as she (<font color='blue'><b>Jo</b></font>) said in a cordial tone, <div class="bookquote">``The old pillow is
up garret, and we don't need it now. So, come and `fess, Teddy.''

 (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div><p/>``How good it sounds to hear you say <div class="bookquote">``Teddy'! No one ever calls me that
but you,''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>and Laurie sat down with an air of great content.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``What does Amy call you?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``My lord.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``That's like her (<font color='blue'><b>Amy</b></font>). Well, you look it,''  (<font color='red'><b>Jo/Miss Jo/JO</b></font>)</div>and Jo's eye plainly betrayed
that she (<font color='blue'><b>Jo</b></font>) found her (<font color='blue'><b>Jo</b></font>) boy comelier than ever.

<p/>The pillow was gone, but there was a barricade, nevertheless, a natural
one, raised by time, absence, and change of heart. Both felt it, and
for a minute looked at one another as if that invisible barrier cast a
little shadow over them. It was gone directly however, for Laurie
said, with a vain attempt at dignity...

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Don't I look like a married man and the head of a family?''

 (<font color='red'><b>Laurie/Mr. Laurie/LAURIE</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Not a bit, and you never will. You've grown bigger and bonnier, but
you are the same scapegrace as ever.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Now really, Jo, you ought to treat me with more respect,''  (<font color='red'><b>Laurie/Mr. Laurie/LAURIE</b></font>)</div>began
Laurie, who enjoyed it all immensely.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``How can I, when the mere idea of you, married and settled, is so
irresistibly funny that I can't keep sober!''  (<font color='red'><b>Jo/Miss Jo/JO</b></font>)</div>answered Jo, smiling all
over her (<font color='blue'><b>Jo</b></font>) face, so infectiously that they had another laugh, and then
settled down for a good talk, quite in the pleasant old fashion.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``It's no use your going out in the cold to get Amy, for they are all
coming up presently. I couldn't wait. I wanted to be the one to tell
you the grand surprise, and have `first skim' as we used to say when we
squabbled about the cream.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Of course you did, and spoiled your story by beginning at the wrong
end. Now, start right, and tell me how it all happened. I'm pining to
know.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Well, I did it to please Amy,''  (<font color='red'><b>Laurie/Mr. Laurie/LAURIE</b></font>)</div>began Laurie, with a twinkle that made
Jo exclaim...

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Fib number one. Amy did it to please you. Go on, and tell the truth,
if you can, sir.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Jo/Miss Jo/JO</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Now she (<font color='blue'><b>Amy</b></font>)'s beginning to marm it. Isn't it jolly to hear her (<font color='blue'><b>Amy</b></font>)?''  (<font color='red'><b>Laurie/Mr. Laurie/LAURIE</b></font>)</div>said
Laurie to the fire, and the fire glowed and sparkled as if it quite
agreed. ``It's all the same, you know, she (<font color='blue'><b>Amy</b></font>) and I being one. We planned
to come home with the Carrols, a month or more ago, but they suddenly
changed their minds, and decided to pass another winter in Paris. But
Grandpa wanted to come home. He (<font color='blue'><b>Grandpa</b></font>) went to please me, and I couldn't let
him (<font color='blue'><b>Grandpa</b></font>) go alone, neither could I leave Amy, and Mrs. Carrol had got
English notions about chaperons and such nonsense, and wouldn't let Amy
come with us. So I just settled the difficulty by saying, <div class="bookquote">``Let's be
married, and then we can do as we like'.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Of course you did. You always have things to suit you.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Not always,''  (<font color='red'><b>Laurie/Mr. Laurie/LAURIE</b></font>)</div>and something in Laurie's voice made Jo say hastily...

<p/><div class="bookquote">``How did you ever get Aunt to agree?''

 (<font color='red'><b>Jo/Miss Jo/JO</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``It was hard work, but between us, we talked her (<font color='blue'><b>Aunt</b></font>) over, for we had heaps
of good reasons on our side. There wasn't time to write and ask leave,
but you all liked it, had consented to it by-and-by, and it was only
`taking time by the fetlock', as my wife says.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Aren't we proud of those two words, and don't we like to say them?''
 (<font color='red'><b>Jo/Miss Jo/JO</b></font>)</div>interrupted Jo, addressing the fire in her (<font color='blue'><b>Jo</b></font>) turn, and watching with
delight the happy light it seemed to kindle in the eyes that had been
so tragically gloomy when she (<font color='blue'><b>Jo</b></font>) saw them last.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``A trifle, perhaps, she (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>)'s such a captivating little woman I can't help
being proud of her (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>). Well, then Uncle and Aunt were there to play
propriety. We were so absorbed in one another we were of no mortal use
apart, and that charming arrangement would make everything easy all
round, so we did it.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``When, where, how?''  (<font color='red'><b>Jo/Miss Jo/JO</b></font>)</div>asked Jo, in a fever of feminine interest and
curiosity, for she (<font color='blue'><b>Jo</b></font>) could not realize it a particle.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Six weeks ago, at the American consul's, in Paris, a very quiet
wedding of course, for even in our happiness we didn't forget dear
little Beth.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Jo/Miss Jo/JO</b></font>)</div><p/>Jo put her (<font color='blue'><b>Jo</b></font>) hand in his (<font color='blue'><b>Laurie</b></font>) as he (<font color='blue'><b>Laurie</b></font>) said that, and Laurie gently smoothed the
little red pillow, which he (<font color='blue'><b>Laurie</b></font>) remembered well.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Why didn't you let us know afterward?''  (<font color='red'><b>Jo/Miss Jo/JO</b></font>)</div>asked Jo, in a quieter tone,
when they had sat quite still a minute.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``We wanted to surprise you. We thought we were coming directly home,
at first, but the dear old gentleman, as soon as we were married, found
he (<font color='blue'><b>gentleman</b></font>) couldn't be ready under a month, at least, and sent us off to spend
our honeymoon wherever we liked. Amy had once called Valrosa a regular
honeymoon home, so we went there, and were as happy as people are but
once in their lives. My faith! Wasn't it love among the roses!''

 (<font color='red'><b>Laurie/Mr. Laurie/LAURIE</b></font>)</div><p/>Laurie seemed to forget Jo for a minute, and Jo was glad of it, for the
fact that he (<font color='blue'><b>Laurie</b></font>) told her (<font color='blue'><b>Jo</b></font>) these things so freely and so naturally assured
her (<font color='blue'><b>Jo</b></font>) that he (<font color='blue'><b>Laurie</b></font>) had quite forgiven and forgotten. She (<font color='blue'><b>Jo</b></font>) tried to draw away
her (<font color='blue'><b>Jo</b></font>) hand, but as if he (<font color='blue'><b>Laurie</b></font>) guessed the thought that prompted the
half-involuntary impulse, Laurie held it fast, and said, with a manly
gravity she (<font color='blue'><b>Jo</b></font>) had never seen in him (<font color='blue'><b>Laurie</b></font>) before...

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Jo, dear, I want to say one thing, and then we'll put it by forever.
As I told you in my letter when I wrote that Amy had been so kind to
me, I never shall stop loving you, but the love is altered, and I have
learned to see that it is better as it is. Amy and you changed places
in my heart, that's all. I think it was meant to be so, and would have
come about naturally, if I had waited, as you tried to make me, but I
never could be patient, and so I got a heartache. I was a boy then,
headstrong and violent, and it took a hard lesson to show me my
mistake. For it was one, Jo, as you said, and I found it out, after
making a fool of myself. Upon my word, I was so tumbled up in my mind,
at one time, that I didn't know which I loved best, you or Amy, and
tried to love you both alike. But I couldn't, and when I saw her (<font color='blue'><b>Amy</b></font>) in
Switzerland, everything seemed to clear up all at once. You both got
into your right places, and I felt sure that it was well off with the
old love before it was on with the new, that I could honestly share my
heart between sister Jo and wife Amy, and love them dearly. Will you
believe it, and go back to the happy old times when we first knew one
another?''

 (<font color='red'><b>him</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I'll believe it, with all my heart, but, Teddy, we never can be boy
and girl again. The happy old times can't come back, and we mustn't
expect it. We are man and woman now, with sober work to do, for
playtime is over, and we must give up frolicking. I'm sure you feel
this. I see the change in you, and you'll find it in me. I shall miss
my boy, but I shall love the man as much, and admire him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) more, because
he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) means to be what I hoped he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) would. We can't be little playmates any
longer, but we will be brother and sister, to love and help one another
all our lives, won't we, Laurie?''

 (<font color='red'><b>He</b></font>)</div><p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Laurie</b></font>) did not say a word, but took the hand she (<font color='blue'><b>Jo</b></font>) offered him (<font color='blue'><b>Laurie</b></font>), and laid his (<font color='blue'><b>Laurie</b></font>)
face down on it for a minute, feeling that out of the grave of a boyish
passion, there had risen a beautiful, strong friendship to bless them
both. Presently Jo said cheerfully, for she (<font color='blue'><b>Jo</b></font>) didn't want the coming
home to be a sad one, <div class="bookquote">``I can't make it true that you children are
really married and going to set up housekeeping. Why, it seems only
yesterday that I was buttoning Amy's pinafore, and pulling your hair
when you teased. Mercy me, how time does fly!''

 (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``As one of the children is older than yourself, you needn't talk so
like a grandma. I flatter myself I'm a `gentleman growed' as Peggotty
said of David, and when you see Amy, you'll find her (<font color='blue'><b>Amy</b></font>) rather a
precocious infant,''  (<font color='red'><b>Laurie/Mr. Laurie/LAURIE</b></font>)</div>said Laurie, looking amused at her (<font color='blue'><b>Jo</b></font>) maternal air.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``You may be a little older in years, but I'm ever so much older in
feeling, Teddy. Women always are, and this last year has been such a
hard one that I feel forty.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Poor Jo! We left you to bear it alone, while we went pleasuring. You
are older. Here's a line, and there's another. Unless you smile, your
eyes look sad, and when I touched the cushion, just now, I found a tear
on it. You've had a great deal to bear, and had to bear it all alone.
What a selfish beast I've been!''  (<font color='red'><b>Laurie/Mr. Laurie/LAURIE</b></font>)</div>and Laurie pulled his (<font color='blue'><b>Laurie</b></font>) own hair, with a
remorseful look.

<p/>But Jo only turned over the traitorous pillow, and answered, in a tone
which she (<font color='blue'><b>Jo</b></font>) tried to make more cheerful, <div class="bookquote">``No, I had Father and Mother to
help me, and the dear babies to comfort me, and the thought that you
and Amy were safe and happy, to make the troubles here easier to bear.
I am lonely, sometimes, but I dare say it's good for me, and...''

 (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``You never shall be again,''  (<font color='red'><b>Laurie/Mr. Laurie/LAURIE</b></font>)</div>broke in Laurie, putting his (<font color='blue'><b>Laurie</b></font>) arm about her (<font color='blue'><b>Jo</b></font>),
as if to fence out every human ill. <div class="bookquote">``Amy and I can't get on without
you, so you must come and teach `the children' to keep house, and go
halves in everything, just as we used to do, and let us pet you, and
all be blissfully happy and friendly together.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``If I shouldn't be in the way, it would be very pleasant. I begin to
feel quite young already, for somehow all my troubles seemed to fly
away when you came. You always were a comfort, Teddy,''  (<font color='red'><b>Jo/Miss Jo/JO</b></font>)</div>and Jo leaned
her (<font color='blue'><b>Jo</b></font>) head on his (<font color='blue'><b>Laurie</b></font>) shoulder, just as she (<font color='blue'><b>Jo</b></font>) did years ago, when Beth lay ill
and Laurie told her (<font color='blue'><b>Beth</b></font>) to hold on to him (<font color='blue'><b>Laurie</b></font>).

<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Laurie</b></font>) looked down at her (<font color='blue'><b>Beth</b></font>), wondering if she (<font color='blue'><b>Beth</b></font>) remembered the time, but Jo was
smiling to herself, as if in truth her (<font color='blue'><b>Jo</b></font>) troubles had all vanished at his (<font color='blue'><b>Laurie</b></font>)
coming.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``You are the same Jo still, dropping tears about one minute, and
laughing the next. You look a little wicked now. What is it, Grandma?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I was wondering how you and Amy get on together.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Like angels!''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Yes, of course, but which rules?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I don't mind telling you that she (<font color='blue'><b>Amy</b></font>) does now, at least I let her (<font color='blue'><b>Amy</b></font>) think
so, it pleases her (<font color='blue'><b>Amy</b></font>), you know. By-and-by we shall take turns, for
marriage, they say, halves one's rights and doubles one's duties.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``You'll go on as you begin, and Amy will rule you all the days of your
life.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Well, she (<font color='blue'><b>Amy</b></font>) does it so imperceptibly that I don't think I shall mind
much. She (<font color='blue'><b>Amy</b></font>) is the sort of woman who knows how to rule well. In fact, I
rather like it, for she (<font color='blue'><b>Amy</b></font>) winds one round her (<font color='blue'><b>Amy</b></font>) finger as softly and
prettily as a skein of silk, and makes you feel as if she (<font color='blue'><b>Amy</b></font>) was doing you
a favor all the while.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``That ever I should live to see you a henpecked husband and enjoying
it!''  (<font color='red'><b>Jo/Miss Jo/JO</b></font>)</div>cried Jo, with uplifted hands.

<p/>It was good to see Laurie square his (<font color='blue'><b>Laurie</b></font>) shoulders, and smile with
masculine scorn at that insinuation, as he (<font color='blue'><b>Laurie</b></font>) replied, with his (<font color='blue'><b>Laurie</b></font>) <div class="bookquote">``high and
mighty''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>air, <div class="bookquote">``Amy is too well-bred for that, and I am not the sort of
man to submit to it. My wife and I respect ourselves and one another
too much ever to tyrannize or quarrel.''

 (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div><p/>Jo liked that, and thought the new dignity very becoming, but the boy
seemed changing very fast into the man, and regret mingled with her (<font color='blue'><b>Jo</b></font>)
pleasure.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``I am sure of that. Amy and you never did quarrel as we used to. She (<font color='blue'><b>Amy</b></font>)
is the sun and I the wind, in the fable, and the sun managed the man
best, you remember.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``She (<font color='blue'><b>Amy</b></font>) can blow him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) up as well as shine on him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>),''  (<font color='red'><b>Laurie/Mr. Laurie/LAURIE</b></font>)</div>laughed Laurie. <div class="bookquote">``Such a
lecture as I got at Nice! I give you my word it was a deal worse than
any of your scoldings, a regular rouser. I'll tell you all about it
sometime, she (<font color='blue'><b>Amy</b></font>) never will, because after telling me that she (<font color='blue'><b>Amy</b></font>) despised
and was ashamed of me, she (<font color='blue'><b>Amy</b></font>) lost her (<font color='blue'><b>Amy</b></font>) heart to the despicable party and
married the good-for-nothing.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``What baseness! Well, if she (<font color='blue'><b>Amy</b></font>) abuses you, come to me, and I'll defend
you.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I look as if I needed it, don't I?''  (<font color='red'><b>Laurie/Mr. Laurie/LAURIE</b></font>)</div>said Laurie, getting up and
striking an attitude which suddenly changed from the imposing to the
rapturous, as Amy's voice was heard calling, <div class="bookquote">``Where is she (<font color='blue'><b>Amy</b></font>)? Where's my
dear old Jo?''

 (<font color='red'><b>Amy/Amy March</b></font>)</div><p/>In trooped the whole family, and everyone was hugged and kissed all
over again, and after several vain attempts, the three wanderers were
set down to be looked at and exulted over. Mr. Laurence, hale and
hearty as ever, was quite as much improved as the others by his (<font color='blue'><b>Laurence</b></font>) foreign
tour, for the crustiness seemed to be nearly gone, and the
old-fashioned courtliness had received a polish which made it kindlier
than ever. It was good to see him (<font color='blue'><b>Laurence</b></font>) beam at `my children', as he (<font color='blue'><b>Laurence</b></font>) called
the young pair. It was better still to see Amy pay him (<font color='blue'><b>Laurence</b></font>) the daughterly
duty and affection which completely won his (<font color='blue'><b>Laurence</b></font>) old heart, and best of all,
to watch Laurie revolve about the two, as if never tired of enjoying
the pretty picture they made.

<p/>The minute she (<font color='blue'><b>Amy</b></font>) put her (<font color='blue'><b>Amy</b></font>) eyes upon Amy, Meg became conscious that her (<font color='blue'><b>Meg</b></font>) own
dress hadn't a Parisian air, that young Mrs. Moffat would be entirely
eclipsed by young Mrs. Laurence, and that `her (<font color='blue'><b>Laurence</b></font>) ladyship' was altogether
a most elegant and graceful woman. Jo thought, as she (<font color='blue'><b>Jo</b></font>) watched the
pair, <div class="bookquote">``How well they look together! I was right, and Laurie has found
the beautiful, accomplished girl who will become his (<font color='blue'><b>Laurie</b></font>) home better than
clumsy old Jo, and be a pride, not a torment to him (<font color='blue'><b>Laurie</b></font>).''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>Mrs. March and
her (<font color='blue'><b>Jo</b></font>) husband smiled and nodded at each other with happy faces, for they
saw that their youngest had done well, not only in worldly things, but
the better wealth of love, confidence, and happiness.

<p/>For Amy's face was full of the soft brightness which betokens a
peaceful heart, her (<font color='blue'><b>Amy</b></font>) voice had a new tenderness in it, and the cool,
prim carriage was changed to a gentle dignity, both womanly and
winning. No little affectations marred it, and the cordial sweetness of
her (<font color='blue'><b>Amy</b></font>) manner was more charming than the new beauty or the old grace, for
it stamped her (<font color='blue'><b>Amy</b></font>) at once with the unmistakable sign of the true
gentlewoman she (<font color='blue'><b>Amy</b></font>) had hoped to become.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Love has done much for our little girl,''  (<font color='red'><b>mother</b></font>)</div>said her (<font color='blue'><b>Amy</b></font>) mother softly.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``She (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) has had a good example before her (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) all her (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) life, my dear,''  (<font color='red'><b>Mr.</b></font>)</div>Mr.
March whispered back, with a loving look at the worn face and gray head
beside him (<font color='blue'><b>Mr.</b></font>).

<p/>Daisy found it impossible to keep her (<font color='blue'><b>Daisy</b></font>) eyes off her (<font color='blue'><b>Daisy</b></font>) `pitty aunty', but
attached herself like a lap dog to the wonderful chatelaine full of
delightful charms. Demi paused to consider the new relationship before
he (<font color='blue'><b>Mr.</b></font>) compromised himself by the rash acceptance of a bribe, which took
the tempting form of a family of wooden bears from Berne. A flank
movement produced an unconditional surrender, however, for Laurie knew
where to have him (<font color='blue'><b>Laurie</b></font>).

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Young man, when I first had the honor of making your acquaintance you
hit me in the face. Now I demand the satisfaction of a gentleman,''  (<font color='red'><b>the uncle</b></font>)</div>and
with that the tall uncle proceeded to toss and tousle the small nephew
in a way that damaged his (<font color='blue'><b>nephew</b></font>) philosophical dignity as much as it delighted
his (<font color='blue'><b>nephew</b></font>) boyish soul.

<p/>``Blest if she (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) ain't in silk from head to foot; ain't it a relishin'
sight to see her (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) settin' there as fine as a fiddle, and hear folks
calling little Amy ``Mis. Laurence!''' muttered old Hannah, who could
not resist frequent <div class="bookquote">``peeks''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>through the slide as she (<font color='blue'><b>Hannah</b></font>) set the table in a
most decidedly promiscuous manner.

<p/>Mercy on us, how they did talk! first one, then the other, then all
burst out together--trying to tell the history of three years in half
an hour. It was fortunate that tea was at hand, to produce a lull and
provide refreshment--for they would have been hoarse and faint if they
had gone on much longer. Such a happy procession as filed away into
the little dining room! Mr. March proudly escorted Mrs. Laurence. Mrs.
March as proudly leaned on the arm of `my son'. The old gentleman took
Jo, with a whispered, <div class="bookquote">``You must be my girl now,''  (<font color='red'><b>Jo/Miss Jo/JO</b></font>)</div>and a glance at the
empty corner by the fire, that made Jo whisper back, <div class="bookquote">``I'll try to fill
her (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) place, sir.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Jo/Miss Jo/JO</b></font>)</div><p/>The twins pranced behind, feeling that the millennium was at hand, for
everyone was so busy with the newcomers that they were left to revel at
their own sweet will, and you may be sure they made the most of the
opportunity. Didn't they steal sips of tea, stuff gingerbread ad
libitum, get a hot biscuit apiece, and as a crowning trespass, didn't
they each whisk a captivating little tart into their tiny pockets,
there to stick and crumble treacherously, teaching them that both human
nature and a pastry are frail? Burdened with the guilty consciousness
of the sequestered tarts, and fearing that Dodo's sharp eyes would
pierce the thin disguise of cambric and merino which hid their booty,
the little sinners attached themselves to ``Dranpa', who hadn't his (<font color='blue'><b>Laurence</b></font>)
spectacles on. Amy, who was handed about like refreshments, returned
to the parlor on Father Laurence's arm. The others paired off as
before, and this arrangement left Jo companionless. She (<font color='blue'><b>Jo</b></font>) did not mind
it at the minute, for she (<font color='blue'><b>Jo</b></font>) lingered to answer Hannah's eager inquiry.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Will Miss Amy ride in her (<font color='blue'><b>Amy</b></font>) coop -LRB-coupe-RRB-, and use all them lovely silver
dishes that's stored away over yander?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Shouldn't wonder if she (<font color='blue'><b>Amy</b></font>) drove six white horses, ate off gold plate,
and wore diamonds and point lace every day. Teddy thinks nothing too
good for her (<font color='blue'><b>Amy</b></font>),''  (<font color='red'><b>Jo/Miss Jo/JO</b></font>)</div>returned Jo with infinite satisfaction.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``No more there is! Will you have hash or fishballs for breakfast?''
 (<font color='red'><b>Hannah</b></font>)</div>asked Hannah, who wisely mingled poetry and prose.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``I don't care,''  (<font color='red'><b>Jo/Miss Jo/JO</b></font>)</div>and Jo shut the door, feeling that food was an
uncongenial topic just then. She (<font color='blue'><b>Jo</b></font>) stood a minute looking at the party
vanishing above, and as Demi's short plaid legs toiled up the last
stair, a sudden sense of loneliness came over her (<font color='blue'><b>Demi</b></font>) so strongly that she (<font color='blue'><b>Demi</b></font>)
looked about her (<font color='blue'><b>Demi</b></font>) with dim eyes, as if to find something to lean upon,
for even Teddy had deserted her (<font color='blue'><b>Demi</b></font>). If she (<font color='blue'><b>Demi</b></font>) had known what birthday gift
was coming every minute nearer and nearer, she (<font color='blue'><b>Demi</b></font>) would not have said to
herself, <div class="bookquote">``I'll weep a little weep when I go to bed. It won't do to be
dismal now.''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>Then she (<font color='blue'><b>Demi</b></font>) drew her (<font color='blue'><b>Demi</b></font>) hand over her (<font color='blue'><b>Demi</b></font>) eyes, for one of her (<font color='blue'><b>Demi</b></font>)
boyish habits was never to know where her (<font color='blue'><b>Demi</b></font>) handkerchief was, and had
just managed to call up a smile when there came a knock at the porch
door.

<p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>Demi</b></font>) opened with hospitable haste, and started as if another ghost had
come to surprise her (<font color='blue'><b>Demi</b></font>), for there stood a tall bearded gentleman, beaming
on her (<font color='blue'><b>Demi</b></font>) from the darkness like a midnight sun.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Oh, Mr. Bhaer, I am so glad to see you!''  (<font color='red'><b>Jo/Miss Jo/JO</b></font>)</div>cried Jo, with a clutch, as
if she (<font color='blue'><b>Jo</b></font>) feared the night would swallow him (<font color='blue'><b>gentleman</b></font>) up before she (<font color='blue'><b>Jo</b></font>) could get him (<font color='blue'><b>gentleman</b></font>)
in.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``And I to see Miss Marsch, but no, you haf a party,''  (<font color='red'><b>the Professor</b></font>)</div>and the Professor
paused as the sound of voices and the tap of dancing feet came down to
them.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``No, we haven't, only the family. My sister and friends have just come
home, and we are all very happy. Come in, and make one of us.''

 (<font color='red'><b>a man</b></font>)</div><p/>Though a very social man, I think Mr. Bhaer would have gone decorously
away, and come again another day, but how could he (<font color='blue'><b>Bhaer</b></font>), when Jo shut the
door behind him (<font color='blue'><b>Bhaer</b></font>), and bereft him (<font color='blue'><b>Bhaer</b></font>) of his (<font color='blue'><b>Bhaer</b></font>) hat? Perhaps her (<font color='blue'><b>Jo</b></font>) face had
something to do with it, for she (<font color='blue'><b>Jo</b></font>) forgot to hide her (<font color='blue'><b>Jo</b></font>) joy at seeing him (<font color='blue'><b>Bhaer</b></font>),
and showed it with a frankness that proved irresistible to the solitary
man, whose welcome far exceeded his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) boldest hopes.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``If I shall not be Monsieur de Trop, I will so gladly see them all.
You haf been ill, my friend?''

 (<font color='red'><b>He</b></font>)</div><p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) put the question abruptly, for, as Jo hung up his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) coat, the light
fell on her (<font color='blue'><b>Jo</b></font>) face, and he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) saw a change in it.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Not ill, but tired and sorrowful. We have had trouble since I saw you
last.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Ah, yes, I know. My heart was sore for you when I heard that,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>and he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>)
shook hands again, with such a sympathetic face that Jo felt as if no
comfort could equal the look of the kind eyes, the grasp of the big,
warm hand.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Father, Mother, this is my friend, Professor Bhaer,''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Jo</b></font>) said, with a
face and tone of such irrepressible pride and pleasure that she (<font color='blue'><b>Jo</b></font>) might
as well have blown a trumpet and opened the door with a flourish.

<p/>If the stranger had any doubts about his (<font color='blue'><b>stranger</b></font>) reception, they were set at
rest in a minute by the cordial welcome he (<font color='blue'><b>stranger</b></font>) received. Everyone greeted
him (<font color='blue'><b>stranger</b></font>) kindly, for Jo's sake at first, but very soon they liked him (<font color='blue'><b>stranger</b></font>) for
his (<font color='blue'><b>stranger</b></font>) own. They could not help it, for he (<font color='blue'><b>stranger</b></font>) carried the talisman that
opens all hearts, and these simple people warmed to him (<font color='blue'><b>stranger</b></font>) at once,
feeling even the more friendly because he (<font color='blue'><b>stranger</b></font>) was poor. For poverty
enriches those who live above it, and is a sure passport to truly
hospitable spirits. Mr. Bhaer sat looking about him (<font color='blue'><b>Bhaer</b></font>) with the air of a
traveler who knocks at a strange door, and when it opens, finds himself
at home. The children went to him (<font color='blue'><b>Bhaer</b></font>) like bees to a honeypot, and
establishing themselves on each knee, proceeded to captivate him (<font color='blue'><b>Bhaer</b></font>) by
rifling his (<font color='blue'><b>Bhaer</b></font>) pockets, pulling his (<font color='blue'><b>Bhaer</b></font>) beard, and investigating his (<font color='blue'><b>Bhaer</b></font>) watch,
with juvenile audacity. The women telegraphed their approval to one
another, and Mr. March, feeling that he (<font color='blue'><b>Mr.</b></font>) had got a kindred spirit,
opened his (<font color='blue'><b>Mr.</b></font>) choicest stores for his (<font color='blue'><b>Mr.</b></font>) guest's benefit, while silent John
listened and enjoyed the talk, but said not a word, and Mr. Laurence
found it impossible to go to sleep.

<p/>If Jo had not been otherwise engaged, Laurie's behavior would have
amused her (<font color='blue'><b>Jo</b></font>), for a faint twinge, not of jealousy, but something like
suspicion, caused that gentleman to stand aloof at first, and observe
the newcomer with brotherly circumspection. But it did not last long.
He (<font color='blue'><b>newcomer</b></font>) got interested in spite of himself, and before he (<font color='blue'><b>newcomer</b></font>) knew it, was drawn
into the circle. For Mr. Bhaer talked well in this genial atmosphere,
and did himself justice. He (<font color='blue'><b>Bhaer</b></font>) seldom spoke to Laurie, but he (<font color='blue'><b>Bhaer</b></font>) looked at
him (<font color='blue'><b>Bhaer</b></font>) often, and a shadow would pass across his (<font color='blue'><b>Bhaer</b></font>) face, as if regretting
his (<font color='blue'><b>Bhaer</b></font>) own lost youth, as he (<font color='blue'><b>Bhaer</b></font>) watched the young man in his (<font color='blue'><b>Bhaer</b></font>) prime. Then his (<font color='blue'><b>Bhaer</b></font>)
eyes would turn to Jo so wistfully that she (<font color='blue'><b>Jo</b></font>) would have surely answered
the mute inquiry if she (<font color='blue'><b>Jo</b></font>) had seen it. But Jo had her (<font color='blue'><b>Jo</b></font>) own eyes to take
care of, and feeling that they could not be trusted, she (<font color='blue'><b>Jo</b></font>) prudently kept
them on the little sock she (<font color='blue'><b>Jo</b></font>) was knitting, like a model maiden aunt.

<p/>A stealthy glance now and then refreshed her (<font color='blue'><b>Jo</b></font>) like sips of fresh water
after a dusty walk, for the sidelong peeps showed her (<font color='blue'><b>Jo</b></font>) several
propitious omens. Mr. Bhaer's face had lost the absent-minded
expression, and looked all alive with interest in the present moment,
actually young and handsome, she (<font color='blue'><b>Jo</b></font>) thought, forgetting to compare him (<font color='blue'><b>Bhaer</b></font>)
with Laurie, as she (<font color='blue'><b>Jo</b></font>) usually did strange men, to their great detriment.
Then he (<font color='blue'><b>Laurie</b></font>) seemed quite inspired, though the burial customs of the
ancients, to which the conversation had strayed, might not be
considered an exhilarating topic. Jo quite glowed with triumph when
Teddy got quenched in an argument, and thought to herself, as she (<font color='blue'><b>Jo</b></font>)
watched her (<font color='blue'><b>Jo</b></font>) father's absorbed face, <div class="bookquote">``How he (<font color='blue'><b>Professor</b></font>) would enjoy having such a
man as my Professor to talk with every day!''  (<font color='red'><b>father</b></font>)</div>Lastly, Mr. Bhaer was
dressed in a new suit of black, which made him (<font color='blue'><b>Bhaer</b></font>) look more like a
gentleman than ever. His (<font color='blue'><b>Bhaer</b></font>) bushy hair had been cut and smoothly brushed,
but didn't stay in order long, for in exciting moments, he (<font color='blue'><b>Bhaer</b></font>) rumpled it
up in the droll way he (<font color='blue'><b>Bhaer</b></font>) used to do, and Jo liked it rampantly erect
better than flat, because she (<font color='blue'><b>Jo</b></font>) thought it gave his (<font color='blue'><b>Bhaer</b></font>) fine forehead a
Jove-like aspect. Poor Jo, how she (<font color='blue'><b>Jo</b></font>) did glorify that plain man, as she (<font color='blue'><b>Jo</b></font>)
sat knitting away so quietly, yet letting nothing escape her (<font color='blue'><b>Jo</b></font>), not even
the fact that Mr. Bhaer actually had gold sleeve-buttons in his (<font color='blue'><b>Bhaer</b></font>)
immaculate wristbands.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Dear old fellow! He (<font color='blue'><b>fellow</b></font>) couldn't have got himself up with more care if
he (<font color='blue'><b>fellow</b></font>)'d been going a-wooing,''  (<font color='red'><b>Jo/Miss Jo/JO</b></font>)</div>said Jo to herself, and then a sudden
thought born of the words made her (<font color='blue'><b>Jo</b></font>) blush so dreadfully that she (<font color='blue'><b>Jo</b></font>) had to
drop her (<font color='blue'><b>Jo</b></font>) ball, and go down after it to hide her (<font color='blue'><b>Jo</b></font>) face.

<p/>The maneuver did not succeed as well as she (<font color='blue'><b>Jo</b></font>) expected, however, for
though just in the act of setting fire to a funeral pyre, the Professor
dropped his (<font color='blue'><b>Professor</b></font>) torch, metaphorically speaking, and made a dive after the
little blue ball. Of course they bumped their heads smartly together,
saw stars, and both came up flushed and laughing, without the ball, to
resume their seats, wishing they had not left them.

<p/>Nobody knew where the evening went to, for Hannah skillfully abstracted
the babies at an early hour, nodding like two rosy poppies, and Mr.
Laurence went home to rest. The others sat round the fire, talking
away, utterly regardless of the lapse of time, till Meg, whose maternal
mind was impressed with a firm conviction that Daisy had tumbled out of
bed, and Demi set his (<font color='blue'><b>Laurence</b></font>) nightgown afire studying the structure of
matches, made a move to go.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``We must have our sing, in the good old way, for we are all together
again once more,''  (<font color='red'><b>Jo/Miss Jo/JO</b></font>)</div>said Jo, feeling that a good shout would be a safe
and pleasant vent for the jubilant emotions of her (<font color='blue'><b>Jo</b></font>) soul.

<p/>They were not all there. But no one found the words thoughtless or
untrue, for Beth still seemed among them, a peaceful presence,
invisible, but dearer than ever, since death could not break the
household league that love made dissoluble. The little chair stood in
its old place. The tidy basket, with the bit of work she (<font color='blue'><b>Beth</b></font>) left
unfinished when the needle grew `so heavy', was still on its accustomed
shelf. The beloved instrument, seldom touched now had not been moved,
and above it Beth's face, serene and smiling, as in the early days,
looked down upon them, seeming to say, <div class="bookquote">``Be happy. I am here.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Beth</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Play something, Amy. Let them hear how much you have improved,''  (<font color='red'><b>Laurie/Mr. Laurie/LAURIE</b></font>)</div>said
Laurie, with pardonable pride in his (<font color='blue'><b>Laurie</b></font>) promising pupil.

<p/>But Amy whispered, with full eyes, as she (<font color='blue'><b>Amy</b></font>) twirled the faded stool, <div class="bookquote">``Not
tonight, dear. I can't show off tonight.''

 (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div><p/>But she (<font color='blue'><b>Amy</b></font>) did show something better than brilliancy or skill, for she (<font color='blue'><b>Amy</b></font>)
sang Beth's songs with a tender music in her (<font color='blue'><b>Amy</b></font>) voice which the best
master could not have taught, and touched the listener's hearts with a
sweeter power than any other inspiration could have given her (<font color='blue'><b>Amy</b></font>). The
room was very still, when the clear voice failed suddenly at the last
line of Beth's favorite hymn. It was hard to say...

<p/>Earth hath no sorrow that heaven cannot heal;

<p/>and Amy leaned against her (<font color='blue'><b>Amy</b></font>) husband, who stood behind her (<font color='blue'><b>Amy</b></font>), feeling that
her (<font color='blue'><b>Amy</b></font>) welcome home was not quite perfect without Beth's kiss.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Now, we must finish with Mignon's song, for Mr. Bhaer sings that,''
 (<font color='red'><b>Jo/Miss Jo/JO</b></font>)</div>said Jo, before the pause grew painful. And Mr. Bhaer cleared his (<font color='blue'><b>Bhaer</b></font>)
throat with a gratified <div class="bookquote">``Hem!''  (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Bhaer</b></font>)</div>as he (<font color='blue'><b>Bhaer</b></font>) stepped into the corner where Jo
stood, saying...

<p/><div class="bookquote">``You will sing with me? We go excellently well together.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Jo/Miss Jo/JO</b></font>)</div><p/>A pleasing fiction, by the way, for Jo had no more idea of music than a
grasshopper. But she (<font color='blue'><b>Jo</b></font>) would have consented if he (<font color='blue'><b>Bhaer</b></font>) had proposed to sing a
whole opera, and warbled away, blissfully regardless of time and tune.
It didn't much matter, for Mr. Bhaer sang like a true German, heartily
and well, and Jo soon subsided into a subdued hum, that she (<font color='blue'><b>Jo</b></font>) might
listen to the mellow voice that seemed to sing for her (<font color='blue'><b>Jo</b></font>) alone.

<p/>Know`st thou the land where the citron blooms,

<p/>used to be the Professor's favorite line, for `das land' meant Germany
to him (<font color='blue'><b>Professor</b></font>), but now he (<font color='blue'><b>Professor</b></font>) seemed to dwell, with peculiar warmth and melody,
upon the words...

<p/>There, oh there, might I with thee,
O, my beloved, go

<p/>and one listener was so thrilled by the tender invitation that she (<font color='blue'><b>Jo</b></font>)
longed to say she (<font color='blue'><b>Jo</b></font>) did know the land, and would joyfully depart thither
whenever he (<font color='blue'><b>listener</b></font>) liked.

<p/>The song was considered a great success, and the singer retired covered
with laurels. But a few minutes afterward, he (<font color='blue'><b>singer</b></font>) forgot his (<font color='blue'><b>singer</b></font>) manners
entirely, and stared at Amy putting on her (<font color='blue'><b>Amy</b></font>) bonnet, for she (<font color='blue'><b>Amy</b></font>) had been
introduced simply as `my sister', and no one had called her (<font color='blue'><b>Amy</b></font>) by her (<font color='blue'><b>Amy</b></font>) new
name since he (<font color='blue'><b>singer</b></font>) came. He (<font color='blue'><b>singer</b></font>) forgot himself still further when Laurie said,
in his (<font color='blue'><b>Laurie</b></font>) most gracious manner, at parting...

<p/><div class="bookquote">``My wife and I are very glad to meet you, sir. Please remember that
there is always a welcome waiting for you over the way.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Laurie/Mr. Laurie/LAURIE</b></font>)</div><p/>Then the Professor thanked him (<font color='blue'><b>Professor</b></font>) so heartily, and looked so suddenly
illuminated with satisfaction, that Laurie thought him (<font color='blue'><b>Laurie</b></font>) the most
delightfully demonstrative old fellow he (<font color='blue'><b>Laurie</b></font>) ever met.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``I too shall go, but I shall gladly come again, if you will gif me
leave, dear madame, for a little business in the city will keep me here
some days.''

 (<font color='red'><b>He</b></font>)</div><p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Laurie</b></font>) spoke to Mrs. March, but he (<font color='blue'><b>Laurie</b></font>) looked at Jo, and the mother's voice
gave as cordial an assent as did the daughter's eyes, for Mrs. March
was not so blind to her (<font color='blue'><b>Jo</b></font>) children's interest as Mrs. Moffat supposed.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``I suspect that is a wise man,''  (<font color='red'><b>Mr.</b></font>)</div>remarked Mr. March, with placid
satisfaction, from the hearthrug, after the last guest had gone.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``I know he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) is a good one,''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>added Mrs. March, with decided approval, as
she (<font color='blue'><b>Moffat</b></font>) wound up the clock.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``I thought you'd like him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>),''  (<font color='red'><b>Jo/Miss Jo/JO</b></font>)</div>was all Jo said, as she (<font color='blue'><b>Jo</b></font>) slipped away to her (<font color='blue'><b>Jo</b></font>)
bed.

<p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>Jo</b></font>) wondered what the business was that brought Mr. Bhaer to the city,
and finally decided that he (<font color='blue'><b>Bhaer</b></font>) had been appointed to some great honor,
somewhere, but had been too modest to mention the fact. If she (<font color='blue'><b>Jo</b></font>) had
seen his (<font color='blue'><b>Bhaer</b></font>) face when, safe in his (<font color='blue'><b>Bhaer</b></font>) own room, he (<font color='blue'><b>Bhaer</b></font>) looked at the picture of a
severe and rigid young lady, with a good deal of hair, who appeared to
be gazing darkly into futurity, it might have thrown some light upon
the subject, especially when he (<font color='blue'><b>Bhaer</b></font>) turned off the gas, and kissed the
picture in the dark.



<p/>CHAPTER FORTY-FOUR

<p/>MY LORD AND LADY

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Please, Madam Mother, could you lend me my wife for half an hour? The
luggage has come, and I've been making hay of Amy's Paris finery,
trying to find some things I want,''  (<font color='red'><b>LADY</b></font>)</div>said Laurie, coming in the next day
to find Mrs. Laurence sitting in her (<font color='blue'><b>Laurence</b></font>) mother's lap, as if being made
`the baby' again.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Certainly. Go, dear, I forgot that you have any home but this,''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>and
Mrs. March pressed the white hand that wore the wedding ring, as if
asking pardon for her (<font color='blue'><b>Laurence</b></font>) maternal covetousness.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``I shouldn't have come over if I could have helped it, but I can't get
on without my little woman any more than a...''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Weathercock can without the wind,''  (<font color='red'><b>Jo/Miss Jo/JO</b></font>)</div>suggested Jo, as he (<font color='blue'><b>Laurie</b></font>) paused for a
simile. Jo had grown quite her (<font color='blue'><b>Jo</b></font>) own saucy self again since Teddy came
home.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Exactly, for Amy keeps me pointing due west most of the time, with
only an occasional whiffle round to the south, and I haven't had an
easterly spell since I was married. Don't know anything about the
north, but am altogether salubrious and balmy, hey, my lady?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Lovely weather so far. I don't know how long it will last, but I'm
not afraid of storms, for I'm learning how to sail my ship. Come home,
dear, and I'll find your bootjack. I suppose that's what you are
rummaging after among my things. Men are so helpless, Mother,''  (<font color='red'><b>Amy/Amy March</b></font>)</div>said
Amy, with a matronly air, which delighted her (<font color='blue'><b>Amy</b></font>) husband.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``What are you going to do with yourselves after you get settled?''  (<font color='red'><b>Jo/Miss Jo/JO</b></font>)</div>asked
Jo, buttoning Amy's cloak as she (<font color='blue'><b>Amy</b></font>) used to button her (<font color='blue'><b>Amy</b></font>) pinafores.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``We have our plans. We don't mean to say much about them yet, because
we are such very new brooms, but we don't intend to be idle. I'm going
into business with a devotion that shall delight Grandfather, and prove
to him (<font color='blue'><b>Grandfather</b></font>) that I'm not spoiled. I need something of the sort to keep me
steady. I'm tired of dawdling, and mean to work like a man.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``And Amy, what is she (<font color='blue'><b>Amy</b></font>) going to do?''  (<font color='red'><b>Laurie/Mr. Laurie/LAURIE</b></font>)</div>asked Mrs. March, well pleased at
Laurie's decision and the energy with which he (<font color='blue'><b>Laurie</b></font>) spoke.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``After doing the civil all round, and airing our best bonnet, we shall
astonish you by the elegant hospitalities of our mansion, the brilliant
society we shall draw about us, and the beneficial influence we shall
exert over the world at large. That's about it, isn't it, Madame
Recamier?''  (<font color='red'><b>Laurie/Mr. Laurie/LAURIE</b></font>)</div>asked Laurie with a quizzical look at Amy.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Time will show. Come away, Impertinence, and don't shock my family by
calling me names before their faces,''  (<font color='red'><b>Amy/Amy March</b></font>)</div>answered Amy, resolving that
there should be a home with a good wife in it before she (<font color='blue'><b>Amy</b></font>) set up a salon
as a queen of society.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``How happy those children seem together!''  (<font color='red'><b>Mr.</b></font>)</div>observed Mr. March, finding
it difficult to become absorbed in his (<font color='blue'><b>Mr.</b></font>) Aristotle after the young couple
had gone.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Yes, and I think it will last,''  (<font color='red'><b>a pilot</b></font>)</div>added Mrs. March, with the restful
expression of a pilot who has brought a ship safely into port.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``I know it will. Happy Amy!''  (<font color='red'><b>Jo/Miss Jo/JO</b></font>)</div>and Jo sighed, then smiled brightly as
Professor Bhaer opened the gate with an impatient push.

<p/>Later in the evening, when his (<font color='blue'><b>Professor</b></font>) mind had been set at rest about the
bootjack, Laurie said suddenly to his (<font color='blue'><b>Laurie</b></font>) wife, <div class="bookquote">``Mrs. Laurence.''

 (<font color='red'><b>wife Laurence</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``My Lord!''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``That man intends to marry our Jo!''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I hope so, don't you, dear?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Well, my love, I consider him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) a trump, in the fullest sense of that
expressive word, but I do wish he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) was a little younger and a good deal
richer.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Now, Laurie, don't be too fastidious and worldly-minded. If they love
one another it doesn't matter a particle how old they are nor how poor.
Women never should marry for money...''  (<font color='red'><b>Amy/Amy March</b></font>)</div>Amy caught herself up short as
the words escaped her (<font color='blue'><b>Amy</b></font>), and looked at her (<font color='blue'><b>Amy</b></font>) husband, who replied, with
malicious gravity...

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Certainly not, though you do hear charming girls say that they intend
to do it sometimes. If my memory serves me, you once thought it your
duty to make a rich match. That accounts, perhaps, for your marrying a
good-for-nothing like me.''

 (<font color='red'><b>husband</b></font>)</div><p/>``Oh, my dearest boy, don't, don't say that! I forgot you were rich
when I said <div class="bookquote">``Yes'. I'd have married you if you hadn't a penny, and I
sometimes wish you were poor that I might show how much I love you.''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>And Amy, who was very dignified in public and very fond in private,
gave convincing proofs of the truth of her (<font color='blue'><b>Amy</b></font>) words.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``You don't really think I am such a mercenary creature as I tried to be
once, do you? It would break my heart if you didn't believe that I'd
gladly pull in the same boat with you, even if you had to get your
living by rowing on the lake.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Am I an idiot and a brute? How could I think so, when you refused a
richer man for me, and won't let me give you half I want to now, when I
have the right? Girls do it every day, poor things, and are taught to
think it is their only salvation, but you had better lessons, and
though I trembled for you at one time, I was not disappointed, for the
daughter was true to the mother's teaching. I told Mamma so yesterday,
and she (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) looked as glad and grateful as if I'd given her (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) a check for a
million, to be spent in charity. You are not listening to my moral
remarks, Mrs. Laurence,''  (<font color='red'><b>Laurie/Mr. Laurie/LAURIE</b></font>)</div>and Laurie paused, for Amy's eyes had an
absent look, though fixed upon his (<font color='blue'><b>Laurie</b></font>) face.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Yes, I am, and admiring the mole in your chin at the same time. I
don't wish to make you vain, but I must confess that I'm prouder of my
handsome husband than of all his (<font color='blue'><b>husband</b></font>) money. Don't laugh, but your nose is
such a comfort to me,''  (<font color='red'><b>Amy/Amy March</b></font>)</div>and Amy softly caressed the well-cut feature
with artistic satisfaction.

<p/>Laurie had received many compliments in his (<font color='blue'><b>Laurie</b></font>) life, but never one that
suited him (<font color='blue'><b>Laurie</b></font>) better, as he (<font color='blue'><b>Laurie</b></font>) plainly showed though he (<font color='blue'><b>Laurie</b></font>) did laugh at his (<font color='blue'><b>Laurie</b></font>)
wife's peculiar taste, while she (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>) said slowly, <div class="bookquote">``May I ask you a
question, dear?''

 (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Of course, you may.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Shall you care if Jo does marry Mr. Bhaer?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Oh, that's the trouble is it? I thought there was something in the
dimple that didn't quite suit you. Not being a dog in the manger, but
the happiest fellow alive, I assure you I can dance at Jo's wedding
with a heart as light as my heels. Do you doubt it, my darling?''

 (<font color='red'><b>Amy/Amy March</b></font>)</div><p/>Amy looked up at him (<font color='blue'><b>Laurie</b></font>), and was satisfied. Her (<font color='blue'><b>Amy</b></font>) little jealous fear
vanished forever, and she (<font color='blue'><b>Amy</b></font>) thanked him (<font color='blue'><b>Laurie</b></font>), with a face full of love and
confidence.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``I wish we could do something for that capital old Professor. Couldn't
we invent a rich relation, who shall obligingly die out there in
Germany, and leave him (<font color='blue'><b>Professor</b></font>) a tidy little fortune?''  (<font color='red'><b>Laurie/Mr. Laurie/LAURIE</b></font>)</div>said Laurie, when they
began to pace up and down the long drawing room, arm in arm, as they
were fond of doing, in memory of the chateau garden.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Jo would find us out, and spoil it all. She (<font color='blue'><b>Jo</b></font>) is very proud of him (<font color='blue'><b>Professor</b></font>),
just as he (<font color='blue'><b>Professor</b></font>) is, and said yesterday that she (<font color='blue'><b>Jo</b></font>) thought poverty was a
beautiful thing.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Bless her (<font color='blue'><b>Jo</b></font>) dear heart! She (<font color='blue'><b>Jo</b></font>) won't think so when she (<font color='blue'><b>Jo</b></font>) has a literary
husband, and a dozen little professors and professorins to support. We
won't interfere now, but watch our chance, and do them a good turn in
spite of themselves. I owe Jo for a part of my education, and she (<font color='blue'><b>Jo</b></font>)
believes in people's paying their honest debts, so I'll get round her (<font color='blue'><b>Jo</b></font>)
in that way.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``How delightful it is to be able to help others, isn't it? That was
always one of my dreams, to have the power of giving freely, and thanks
to you, the dream has come true.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Ah, we'll do quantities of good, won't we? There's one sort of
poverty that I particularly like to help. Out-and-out beggars get
taken care of, but poor gentle folks fare badly, because they won't
ask, and people don't dare to offer charity. Yet there are a thousand
ways of helping them, if one only knows how to do it so delicately that
it does not offend. I must say, I like to serve a decayed gentleman
better than a blarnerying beggar. I suppose it's wrong, but I do,
though it is harder.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Because it takes a gentleman to do it,''  (<font color='red'><b>the member</b></font>)</div>added the other member of the
domestic admiration society.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Thank you, I'm afraid I don't deserve that pretty compliment. But I
was going to say that while I was dawdling about abroad, I saw a good
many talented young fellows making all sorts of sacrifices, and
enduring real hardships, that they might realize their dreams. Splendid
fellows, some of them, working like heros, poor and friendless, but so
full of courage, patience, and ambition that I was ashamed of myself,
and longed to give them a right good lift. Those are people whom it's
a satisfaction to help, for if they've got genius, it's an honor to be
allowed to serve them, and not let it be lost or delayed for want of
fuel to keep the pot boiling. If they haven't, it's a pleasure to
comfort the poor souls, and keep them from despair when they find it
out.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Yes, indeed, and there's another class who can't ask, and who suffer
in silence. I know something of it, for I belonged to it before you
made a princess of me, as the king does the beggarmaid in the old
story. Ambitious girls have a hard time, Laurie, and often have to see
youth, health, and precious opportunities go by, just for want of a
little help at the right minute. People have been very kind to me, and
whenever I see girls struggling along, as we used to do, I want to put
out my hand and help them, as I was helped.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``And so you shall, like an angel as you are!''  (<font color='red'><b>Laurie/Mr. Laurie/LAURIE</b></font>)</div>cried Laurie, resolving,
with a glow of philanthropic zeal, to found and endow an institution
for the express benefit of young women with artistic tendencies. <div class="bookquote">``Rich
people have no right to sit down and enjoy themselves, or let their
money accumulate for others to waste. It's not half so sensible to
leave legacies when one dies as it is to use the money wisely while
alive, and enjoy making one's fellow creatures happy with it. We'll
have a good time ourselves, and add an extra relish to our own pleasure
by giving other people a generous taste. Will you be a little Dorcas,
going about emptying a big basket of comforts, and filling it up with
good deeds?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``With all my heart, if you will be a brave St. Martin, stopping as you
ride gallantly through the world to share your cloak with the beggar.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``It's a bargain, and we shall get the best of it!''

 (<font color='red'><b>those blest</b></font>)</div><p/>So the young pair shook hands upon it, and then paced happily on again,
feeling that their pleasant home was more homelike because they hoped
to brighten other homes, believing that their own feet would walk more
uprightly along the flowery path before them, if they smoothed rough
ways for other feet, and feeling that their hearts were more closely
knit together by a love which could tenderly remember those less blest
than they.



<p/>CHAPTER FORTY-FIVE

<p/>DAISY AND DEMI

<p/>I cannot feel that I have done my duty as humble historian of the March
family, without devoting at least one chapter to the two most precious
and important members of it. Daisy and Demi had now arrived at years
of discretion, for in this fast age babies of three or four assert
their rights, and get them, too, which is more than many of their
elders do. If there ever were a pair of twins in danger of being
utterly spoiled by adoration, it was these prattling Brookes. Of
course they were the most remarkable children ever born, as will be
shown when I mention that they walked at eight months, talked fluently
at twelve months, and at two years they took their places at table, and
behaved with a propriety which charmed all beholders. At three, Daisy
demanded a `needler', and actually made a bag with four stitches in it.
She (<font color='blue'><b>Daisy</b></font>) likewise set up housekeeping in the sideboard, and managed a
microscopic cooking stove with a skill that brought tears of pride to
Hannah's eyes, while Demi learned his (<font color='blue'><b>Hannah</b></font>) letters with his (<font color='blue'><b>Hannah</b></font>) grandfather, who
invented a new mode of teaching the alphabet by forming letters with
his (<font color='blue'><b>Hannah</b></font>) arms and legs, thus uniting gymnastics for head and heels. The boy
early developed a mechanical genius which delighted his (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>) father and
distracted his (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>) mother, for he (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>) tried to imitate every machine he (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>) saw,
and kept the nursery in a chaotic condition, with his (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>) `sewinsheen', a
mysterious structure of string, chairs, clothespins, and spools, for
wheels to go `wound and wound'. Also a basket hung over the back of a
chair, in which he (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>) vainly tried to hoist his (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>) too confiding sister, who,
with feminine devotion, allowed her (<font color='blue'><b>sister</b></font>) little head to be bumped till
rescued, when the young inventor indignantly remarked, <div class="bookquote">``Why, Marmar,
dat's my lellywaiter, and me's trying to pull her (<font color='blue'><b>Dorcas</b></font>) up.''

 (<font color='red'><b>the inventor</b></font>)</div><p/>Though utterly unlike in character, the twins got on remarkably well
together, and seldom quarreled more than thrice a day. Of course, Demi
tyrannized over Daisy, and gallantly defended her (<font color='blue'><b>Demi</b></font>) from every other
aggressor, while Daisy made a galley slave of herself, and adored her (<font color='blue'><b>Daisy</b></font>)
brother as the one perfect being in the world. A rosy, chubby,
sunshiny little soul was Daisy, who found her (<font color='blue'><b>Daisy</b></font>) way to everybody's heart,
and nestled there. One of the captivating children, who seem made to
be kissed and cuddled, adorned and adored like little goddesses, and
produced for general approval on all festive occasions. Her (<font color='blue'><b>Daisy</b></font>) small
virtues were so sweet that she (<font color='blue'><b>Daisy</b></font>) would have been quite angelic if a few
small naughtinesses had not kept her (<font color='blue'><b>Daisy</b></font>) delightfully human. It was all
fair weather in her (<font color='blue'><b>Daisy</b></font>) world, and every morning she (<font color='blue'><b>Daisy</b></font>) scrambled up to the
window in her (<font color='blue'><b>Daisy</b></font>) little nightgown to look out, and say, no matter whether
it rained or shone, <div class="bookquote">``Oh, pitty day, oh, pitty day!''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>Everyone was a
friend, and she (<font color='blue'><b>Daisy</b></font>) offered kisses to a stranger so confidingly that the
most inveterate bachelor relented, and baby-lovers became faithful
worshipers.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Me loves evvybody,''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Daisy</b></font>) once said, opening her (<font color='blue'><b>Daisy</b></font>) arms, with her (<font color='blue'><b>Daisy</b></font>) spoon in
one hand, and her (<font color='blue'><b>Daisy</b></font>) mug in the other, as if eager to embrace and nourish
the whole world.

<p/>As she (<font color='blue'><b>Daisy</b></font>) grew, her (<font color='blue'><b>Daisy</b></font>) mother began to feel that the Dovecote would be
blessed by the presence of an inmate as serene and loving as that which
had helped to make the old house home, and to pray that she (<font color='blue'><b>Daisy</b></font>) might be
spared a loss like that which had lately taught them how long they had
entertained an angel unawares. Her (<font color='blue'><b>Daisy</b></font>) grandfather often called her (<font color='blue'><b>Daisy</b></font>)
``Beth', and her (<font color='blue'><b>Beth</b></font>) grandmother watched over her (<font color='blue'><b>Beth</b></font>) with untiring devotion, as
if trying to atone for some past mistake, which no eye but her (<font color='blue'><b>Beth</b></font>) own
could see.

<p/>Demi, like a true Yankee, was of an inquiring turn, wanting to know
everything, and often getting much disturbed because he (<font color='blue'><b>Yankee</b></font>) could not get
satisfactory answers to his (<font color='blue'><b>Yankee</b></font>) perpetual <div class="bookquote">``What for?''

 (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div><p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>grandfather</b></font>) also possessed a philosophic bent, to the great delight of his (<font color='blue'><b>grandfather</b></font>)
grandfather, who used to hold Socratic conversations with him (<font color='blue'><b>grandfather</b></font>), in which
the precocious pupil occasionally posed his (<font color='blue'><b>pupil</b></font>) teacher, to the undisguised
satisfaction of the womenfolk.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``What makes my legs go, Dranpa?''  (<font color='red'><b>the philosopher</b></font>)</div>asked the young philosopher, surveying
those active portions of his (<font color='blue'><b>philosopher</b></font>) frame with a meditative air, while resting
after a go-to-bed frolic one night.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``It's your little mind, Demi,''  (<font color='red'><b>the sage</b></font>)</div>replied the sage, stroking the yellow
head respectfully.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``What is a little mine?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``It is something which makes your body move, as the spring made the
wheels go in my watch when I showed it to you.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Open me. I want to see it go wound.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I can't do that any more than you could open the watch. God winds you
up, and you go till He (<font color='blue'><b>God</b></font>) stops you.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Does I?''  (<font color='red'><b>Demi</b></font>)</div>and Demi's brown eyes grew big and bright as he (<font color='blue'><b>philosopher</b></font>) took in the
new thought. <div class="bookquote">``Is I wounded up like the watch?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Yes, but I can't show you how, for it is done when we don't see.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Demi</b></font>)</div><p/>Demi felt his (<font color='blue'><b>philosopher</b></font>) back, as if expecting to find it like that of the watch,
and then gravely remarked, <div class="bookquote">``I dess Dod does it when I's asleep.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Demi</b></font>)</div><p/>A careful explanation followed, to which he (<font color='blue'><b>philosopher</b></font>) listened so attentively
that his (<font color='blue'><b>philosopher</b></font>) anxious grandmother said, <div class="bookquote">``My dear, do you think it wise to
talk about such things to that baby? He (<font color='blue'><b>God</b></font>)'s getting great bumps over his (<font color='blue'><b>God</b></font>)
eyes, and learning to ask the most unanswerable questions.''

 (<font color='red'><b>grandmother</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``If he (<font color='blue'><b>God</b></font>) is old enough to ask the question he (<font color='blue'><b>God</b></font>) is old enough to receive
true answers. I am not putting the thoughts into his (<font color='blue'><b>God</b></font>) head, but helping
him (<font color='blue'><b>God</b></font>) unfold those already there. These children are wiser than we are,
and I have no doubt the boy understands every word I have said to him (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>).
Now, Demi, tell me where you keep your mind.''

 (<font color='red'><b>the boy</b></font>)</div><p/>If the boy had replied like Alcibiades, <div class="bookquote">``By the gods, Socrates, I
cannot tell,''  (<font color='red'><b>Alcibiades</b></font>)</div>his (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>) grandfather would not have been surprised, but when,
after standing a moment on one leg, like a meditative young stork, he (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>)
answered, in a tone of calm conviction, <div class="bookquote">``In my little belly,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>the old
gentleman could only join in Grandma's laugh, and dismiss the class in
metaphysics.

<p/>There might have been cause for maternal anxiety, if Demi had not given
convincing proofs that he (<font color='blue'><b>gentleman</b></font>) was a true boy, as well as a budding
philosopher, for often, after a discussion which caused Hannah to
prophesy, with ominous nods, <div class="bookquote">``That child ain't long for this world,''  (<font color='red'><b>Hannah</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>)
would turn about and set her (<font color='blue'><b>Hannah</b></font>) fears at rest by some of the pranks with
which dear, dirty, naughty little rascals distract and delight their
parent's souls.

<p/>Meg made many moral rules, and tried to keep them, but what mother was
ever proof against the winning wiles, the ingenious evasions, or the
tranquil audacity of the miniature men and women who so early show
themselves accomplished Artful Dodgers?

<p/><div class="bookquote">``No more raisins, Demi. They'll make you sick,''  (<font color='red'><b>Mamma</b></font>)</div>says Mamma to the
young person who offers his (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>) services in the kitchen with unfailing
regularity on plum-pudding day.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Me likes to be sick.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I don't want to have you, so run away and help Daisy make patty cakes.''

 (<font color='red'><b>He</b></font>)</div><p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>) reluctantly departs, but his (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>) wrongs weigh upon his (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>) spirit, and
by-and-by when an opportunity comes to redress them, he (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>) outwits Mamma
by a shrewd bargain.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Now you have been good children, and I'll play anything you like,''
 (<font color='red'><b>Meg</b></font>)</div>says Meg, as she (<font color='blue'><b>Meg</b></font>) leads her (<font color='blue'><b>Meg</b></font>) assistant cooks upstairs, when the pudding
is safely bouncing in the pot.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Truly, Marmar?''  (<font color='red'><b>Demi</b></font>)</div>asks Demi, with a brilliant idea in his (<font color='blue'><b>assistant</b></font>) well-powdered
head.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Yes, truly. Anything you say,''  (<font color='red'><b>the parent Kittens</b></font>)</div>replies the shortsighted parent,
preparing herself to sing, <div class="bookquote">``The Three Little Kittens''  (<font color='red'><b>the parent Kittens</b></font>)</div>half a dozen
times over, or to take her (<font color='blue'><b>Demi</b></font>) family to <div class="bookquote">``Buy a penny bun,''  (<font color='red'><b>family</b></font>)</div>regardless of
wind or limb. But Demi corners her (<font color='blue'><b>Demi</b></font>) by the cool reply...

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Then we'll go and eat up all the raisins.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Demi</b></font>)</div><p/>Aunt Dodo was chief playmate and confidante of both children, and the
trio turned the little house topsy-turvy. Aunt Amy was as yet only a
name to them, Aunt Beth soon faded into a pleasantly vague memory, but
Aunt Dodo was a living reality, and they made the most of her (<font color='blue'><b>Aunt</b></font>), for
which compliment she (<font color='blue'><b>Aunt</b></font>) was deeply grateful. But when Mr. Bhaer came, Jo
neglected her (<font color='blue'><b>Jo</b></font>) playfellows, and dismay and desolation fell upon their
little souls. Daisy, who was fond of going about peddling kisses, lost
her (<font color='blue'><b>Daisy</b></font>) best customer and became bankrupt. Demi, with infantile
penetration, soon discovered that Dodo like to play with `the bear-man'
better than she (<font color='blue'><b>Demi</b></font>) did him (<font color='blue'><b>Bhaer</b></font>), but though hurt, he (<font color='blue'><b>Bhaer</b></font>) concealed his (<font color='blue'><b>Bhaer</b></font>) anguish, for
he (<font color='blue'><b>Bhaer</b></font>) hadn't the heart to insult a rival who kept a mine of chocolate
drops in his (<font color='blue'><b>Bhaer</b></font>) waistcoat pocket, and a watch that could be taken out of
its case and freely shaken by ardent admirers.

<p/>Some persons might have considered these pleasing liberties as bribes,
but Demi didn't see it in that light, and continued to patronize the
`the bear-man' with pensive affability, while Daisy bestowed her (<font color='blue'><b>Daisy</b></font>) small
affections upon him (<font color='blue'><b>Bhaer</b></font>) at the third call, and considered his (<font color='blue'><b>Bhaer</b></font>) shoulder her (<font color='blue'><b>Daisy</b></font>)
throne, his (<font color='blue'><b>Bhaer</b></font>) arm her (<font color='blue'><b>Daisy</b></font>) refuge, his (<font color='blue'><b>Bhaer</b></font>) gifts treasures surpassing worth.

<p/>Gentlemen are sometimes seized with sudden fits of admiration for the
young relatives of ladies whom they honor with their regard, but this
counterfeit philoprogenitiveness sits uneasily upon them, and does not
deceive anybody a particle. Mr. Bhaer's devotion was sincere, however
likewise effective--for honesty is the best policy in love as in law.
He (<font color='blue'><b>Bhaer</b></font>) was one of the men who are at home with children, and looked
particularly well when little faces made a pleasant contrast with his (<font color='blue'><b>Bhaer</b></font>)
manly one. His (<font color='blue'><b>Bhaer</b></font>) business, whatever it was, detained him (<font color='blue'><b>Bhaer</b></font>) from day to
day, but evening seldom failed to bring him (<font color='blue'><b>Bhaer</b></font>) out to see--well, he (<font color='blue'><b>Bhaer</b></font>) always
asked for Mr. March, so I suppose he (<font color='blue'><b>Mr.</b></font>) was the attraction. The excellent
papa labored under the delusion that he (<font color='blue'><b>papa</b></font>) was, and reveled in long
discussions with the kindred spirit, till a chance remark of his (<font color='blue'><b>papa</b></font>) more
observing grandson suddenly enlightened him (<font color='blue'><b>papa</b></font>).

<p/>Mr. Bhaer came in one evening to pause on the threshold of the study,
astonished by the spectacle that met his (<font color='blue'><b>Bhaer</b></font>) eye. Prone upon the floor lay
Mr. March, with his (<font color='blue'><b>Mr.</b></font>) respectable legs in the air, and beside him (<font color='blue'><b>Mr.</b></font>),
likewise prone, was Demi, trying to imitate the attitude with his (<font color='blue'><b>Mr.</b></font>) own
short, scarlet-stockinged legs, both grovelers so seriously absorbed
that they were unconscious of spectators, till Mr. Bhaer laughed his (<font color='blue'><b>Bhaer</b></font>)
sonorous laugh, and Jo cried out, with a scandalized face...

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Father, Father, here's the Professor!''

 (<font color='red'><b>Jo/Miss Jo/JO</b></font>)</div><p/>Down went the black legs and up came the gray head, as the preceptor
said, with undisturbed dignity, <div class="bookquote">``Good evening, Mr. Bhaer. Excuse me for
a moment. We are just finishing our lesson. Now, Demi, make the
letter and tell its name.''

 (<font color='red'><b>the preceptor</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I knows him (<font color='blue'><b>Bhaer</b></font>)!''  (<font color='red'><b>the pupil</b></font>)</div>and, after a few convulsive efforts, the red legs took
the shape of a pair of compasses, and the intelligent pupil
triumphantly shouted, <div class="bookquote">``It's a We, Dranpa, it's a We!''

 (<font color='red'><b>the pupil</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``He (<font color='blue'><b>Bhaer</b></font>)'s a born Weller,''  (<font color='red'><b>Jo/Miss Jo/JO</b></font>)</div>laughed Jo, as her (<font color='blue'><b>Jo</b></font>) parent gathered himself up,
and her (<font color='blue'><b>Jo</b></font>) nephew tried to stand on his (<font color='blue'><b>nephew</b></font>) head, as the only mode of
expressing his (<font color='blue'><b>nephew</b></font>) satisfaction that school was over.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``What have you been at today, bubchen?''  (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Bhaer</b></font>)</div>asked Mr. Bhaer, picking up the
gymnast.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Me went to see little Mary.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``And what did you there?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I kissed her (<font color='blue'><b>Mary</b></font>),''  (<font color='red'><b>Demi</b></font>)</div>began Demi, with artless frankness.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Prut! Thou beginnest early. What did the little Mary say to that?''
 (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Bhaer</b></font>)</div>asked Mr. Bhaer, continuing to confess the young sinner, who stood upon
the knee, exploring the waistcoat pocket.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Oh, she (<font color='blue'><b>Mary</b></font>) liked it, and she (<font color='blue'><b>Mary</b></font>) kissed me, and I liked it. Don't little
boys like little girls?''  (<font color='red'><b>Demi</b></font>)</div>asked Demi, with his (<font color='blue'><b>Bhaer</b></font>) mouth full, and an air of
bland satisfaction.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``You precocious chick! Who put that into your head?''  (<font color='red'><b>Jo/Miss Jo/JO</b></font>)</div>said Jo, enjoying
the innocent revelation as much as the Professor.

<p/><div class="bookquote">''`Tisn't in mine head, it's in mine mouf,''  (<font color='red'><b>the Professor</b></font>)</div>answered literal Demi,
putting out his (<font color='blue'><b>Professor</b></font>) tongue, with a chocolate drop on it, thinking she (<font color='blue'><b>Demi</b></font>)
alluded to confectionery, not ideas.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Thou shouldst save some for the little friend. Sweets to the sweet,
mannling,''  (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Bhaer</b></font>)</div>and Mr. Bhaer offered Jo some, with a look that made her (<font color='blue'><b>Jo</b></font>)
wonder if chocolate was not the nectar drunk by the gods. Demi also
saw the smile, was impressed by it, and artlessy inquired. ..

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Do great boys like great girls, to, `Fessor?''

 (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Bhaer</b></font>)</div><p/>Like young Washington, Mr. Bhaer `couldn't tell a lie', so he (<font color='blue'><b>Bhaer</b></font>) gave the
somewhat vague reply that he (<font color='blue'><b>Bhaer</b></font>) believed they did sometimes, in a tone
that made Mr. March put down his (<font color='blue'><b>Mr.</b></font>) clothesbrush, glance at Jo's retiring
face, and then sink into his (<font color='blue'><b>Mr.</b></font>) chair, looking as if the `precocious
chick' had put an idea into his (<font color='blue'><b>Mr.</b></font>) head that was both sweet and sour.

<p/>Why Dodo, when she (<font color='blue'><b>Jo</b></font>) caught him (<font color='blue'><b>Mr.</b></font>) in the china closet half an hour
afterward, nearly squeezed the breath out of his (<font color='blue'><b>Mr.</b></font>) little body with a
tender embrace, instead of shaking him (<font color='blue'><b>Mr.</b></font>) for being there, and why she (<font color='blue'><b>Jo</b></font>)
followed up this novel performance by the unexpected gift of a big
slice of bread and jelly, remained one of the problems over which Demi
puzzled his (<font color='blue'><b>Mr.</b></font>) small wits, and was forced to leave unsolved forever.



<p/>CHAPTER FORTY-SIX

<p/>UNDER THE UMBRELLA

<p/>While Laurie and Amy were taking conjugal strolls over velvet carpets,
as they set their house in order, and planned a blissful future, Mr.
Bhaer and Jo were enjoying promenades of a different sort, along muddy
roads and sodden fields.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``I always do take a walk toward evening, and I don't know why I should
give it up, just because I happen to meet the Professor on his (<font color='blue'><b>Professor</b></font>) way
out,''  (<font color='red'><b>Jo/Miss Jo/JO</b></font>)</div>said Jo to herself, after two or three encounters, for though
there were two paths to Meg's whichever one she (<font color='blue'><b>Meg</b></font>) took she (<font color='blue'><b>Meg</b></font>) was sure to
meet him (<font color='blue'><b>Bhaer</b></font>), either going or returning. He (<font color='blue'><b>Bhaer</b></font>) was always walking rapidly, and
never seemed to see her (<font color='blue'><b>Meg</b></font>) until quite close, when he (<font color='blue'><b>Bhaer</b></font>) would look as if his (<font color='blue'><b>Bhaer</b></font>)
short-sighted eyes had failed to recognize the approaching lady till
that moment. Then, if she (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) was going to Meg's he (<font color='blue'><b>Bhaer</b></font>) always had something
for the babies. If her (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) face was turned homeward, he (<font color='blue'><b>Bhaer</b></font>) had merely
strolled down to see the river, and was just returning, unless they
were tired of his (<font color='blue'><b>Bhaer</b></font>) frequent calls.

<p/>Under the circumstances, what could Jo do but greet him (<font color='blue'><b>Bhaer</b></font>) civilly, and
invite him (<font color='blue'><b>Bhaer</b></font>) in? If she (<font color='blue'><b>Jo</b></font>) was tired of his (<font color='blue'><b>Bhaer</b></font>) visits, she (<font color='blue'><b>Jo</b></font>) concealed her (<font color='blue'><b>Jo</b></font>)
weariness with perfect skill, and took care that there should be coffee
for supper, <div class="bookquote">``as Friedrich--I mean Mr. Bhaer--doesn't like tea.''

 (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div><p/>By the second week, everyone knew perfectly well what was going on, yet
everyone tried to look as if they were stone-blind to the changes in
Jo's face. They never asked why she (<font color='blue'><b>Jo</b></font>) sang about her (<font color='blue'><b>Jo</b></font>) work, did up her (<font color='blue'><b>Jo</b></font>)
hair three times a day, and got so blooming with her (<font color='blue'><b>Jo</b></font>) evening exercise.
And no one seemed to have the slightest suspicion that Professor Bhaer,
while talking philosophy with the father, was giving the daughter
lessons in love.

<p/>Jo couldn't even lose her (<font color='blue'><b>Jo</b></font>) heart in a decorous manner, but sternly tried
to quench her (<font color='blue'><b>Jo</b></font>) feelings, and failing to do so, led a somewhat agitated
life. She (<font color='blue'><b>Jo</b></font>) was mortally afraid of being laughed at for surrendering,
after her (<font color='blue'><b>Jo</b></font>) many and vehement declarations of independence. Laurie was
her (<font color='blue'><b>Jo</b></font>) especial dread, but thanks to the new manager, he (<font color='blue'><b>Laurie</b></font>) behaved with
praiseworthy propriety, never called Mr. Bhaer 'a capital old fellow'
in public, never alluded, in the remotest manner, to Jo's improved
appearance, or expressed the least surprise at seeing the Professor's
hat on the Marches' table nearly every evening. But he (<font color='blue'><b>Professor</b></font>) exulted in
private and longed for the time to come when he (<font color='blue'><b>Professor</b></font>) could give Jo a piece
of plate, with a bear and a ragged staff on it as an appropriate coat
of arms.

<p/>For a fortnight, the Professor came and went with lover-like
regularity. Then he (<font color='blue'><b>Professor</b></font>) stayed away for three whole days, and made no
sign, a proceeding which caused everybody to look sober, and Jo to
become pensive, at first, and then--alas for romance--very cross.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Disgusted, I dare say, and gone home as suddenly as he (<font color='blue'><b>Bhaer</b></font>) came. It's
nothing to me, of course, but I should think he (<font color='blue'><b>Bhaer</b></font>) would have come and bid
us goodbye like a gentleman,''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Jo</b></font>) said to herself, with a despairing
look at the gate, as she (<font color='blue'><b>Jo</b></font>) put on her (<font color='blue'><b>Jo</b></font>) things for the customary walk one
dull afternoon.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``You'd better take the little umbrella, dear. It looks like rain,''
 (<font color='red'><b>mother</b></font>)</div>said her (<font color='blue'><b>Jo</b></font>) mother, observing that she (<font color='blue'><b>Jo</b></font>) had on her (<font color='blue'><b>Jo</b></font>) new bonnet, but not
alluding to the fact.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Yes, Marmee, do you want anything in town? I've got to run in and get
some paper,''  (<font color='red'><b>Jo/Miss Jo/JO</b></font>)</div>returned Jo, pulling out the bow under her (<font color='blue'><b>Jo</b></font>) chin before the
glass as an excuse for not looking at her (<font color='blue'><b>Jo</b></font>) mother.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Yes, I want some twilled silesia, a paper of number nine needles, and
two yards of narrow lavender ribbon. Have you got your thick boots on,
and something warm under your cloak?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I believe so,''  (<font color='red'><b>Jo/Miss Jo/JO</b></font>)</div>answered Jo absently.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``If you happen to meet Mr. Bhaer, bring him (<font color='blue'><b>Bhaer</b></font>) home to tea. I quite long
to see the dear man,''  (<font color='red'><b>Jo/Miss Jo/JO</b></font>)</div>added Mrs. March.

<p/>Jo heard that, but made no answer, except to kiss her (<font color='blue'><b>Jo</b></font>) mother, and walk
rapidly away, thinking with a glow of gratitude, in spite of her (<font color='blue'><b>Jo</b></font>)
heartache, <div class="bookquote">``How good she (<font color='blue'><b>you</b></font>) is to me! What do girls do who haven't any
mothers to help them through their troubles?''

 (<font color='red'><b>kiss mother</b></font>)</div><p/>The dry-goods stores were not down among the counting-houses, banks,
and wholesale warerooms, where gentlemen most do congregate, but Jo
found herself in that part of the city before she (<font color='blue'><b>Jo</b></font>) did a single errand,
loitering along as if waiting for someone, examining engineering
instruments in one window and samples of wool in another, with most
unfeminine interest, tumbling over barrels, being half-smothered by
descending bales, and hustled unceremoniously by busy men who looked as
if they wondered `how the deuce she (<font color='blue'><b>Jo</b></font>) got there'. A drop of rain on her (<font color='blue'><b>Jo</b></font>)
cheek recalled her (<font color='blue'><b>Jo</b></font>) thoughts from baffled hopes to ruined ribbons. For
the drops continued to fall, and being a woman as well as a lover, she (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>)
felt that, though it was too late to save her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) heart, she (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) might her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>)
bonnet. Now she (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) remembered the little umbrella, which she (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) had
forgotten to take in her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) hurry to be off, but regret was unavailing,
and nothing could be done but borrow one or submit to a drenching. She (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>)
looked up at the lowering sky, down at the crimson bow already flecked
with black, forward along the muddy street, then one long, lingering
look behind, at a certain grimy warehouse, with <div class="bookquote">``Hoffmann, Swartz, &
Co.''  (<font color='red'><b>She</b></font>)</div>over the door, and said to herself, with a sternly reproachful
air...

<p/><div class="bookquote">``It serves me right! what business had I to put on all my best things
and come philandering down here, hoping to see the Professor? Jo, I'm
ashamed of you! No, you shall not go there to borrow an umbrella, or
find out where he (<font color='blue'><b>Professor</b></font>) is, from his (<font color='blue'><b>Professor</b></font>) friends. You shall trudge away, and do
your errands in the rain, and if you catch your death and ruin your
bonnet, it's no more than you deserve. Now then!''

 (<font color='red'><b>She</b></font>)</div><p/>With that she (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) rushed across the street so impetuously that she (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) narrowly
escaped annihilation from a passing truck, and precipitated herself
into the arms of a stately old gentleman, who said, <div class="bookquote">``I beg pardon,
ma'am,''  (<font color='red'><b>a gentleman</b></font>)</div>and looked mortally offended. Somewhat daunted, Jo righted
herself, spread her (<font color='blue'><b>Jo</b></font>) handkerchief over the devoted ribbons, and putting
temptation behind her (<font color='blue'><b>Jo</b></font>), hurried on, with increasing dampness about the
ankles, and much clashing of umbrellas overhead. The fact that a
somewhat dilapidated blue one remained stationary above the unprotected
bonnet attracted her (<font color='blue'><b>Jo</b></font>) attention, and looking up, she (<font color='blue'><b>Jo</b></font>) saw Mr. Bhaer
looking down.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``I feel to know the strong-minded lady who goes so bravely under many
horse noses, and so fast through much mud. What do you down here, my
friend?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I'm shopping.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Bhaer</b></font>)</div><p/>Mr. Bhaer smiled, as he (<font color='blue'><b>Bhaer</b></font>) glanced from the pickle factory on one side to
the wholesale hide and leather concern on the other, but he (<font color='blue'><b>Bhaer</b></font>) only said
politely, <div class="bookquote">``You haf no umbrella. May I go also, and take for you the
bundles?''

 (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Yes, thank you.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Jo/Miss Jo/JO</b></font>)</div><p/>Jo's cheeks were as red as her (<font color='blue'><b>Jo</b></font>) ribbon, and she (<font color='blue'><b>Jo</b></font>) wondered what he (<font color='blue'><b>Bhaer</b></font>) thought
of her (<font color='blue'><b>Jo</b></font>), but she (<font color='blue'><b>Jo</b></font>) didn't care, for in a minute she (<font color='blue'><b>Jo</b></font>) found herself walking
away arm in arm with her (<font color='blue'><b>Jo</b></font>) Professor, feeling as if the sun had suddenly
burst out with uncommon brilliancy, that the world was all right again,
and that one thoroughly happy woman was paddling through the wet that
day.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``We thought you had gone,''  (<font color='red'><b>Jo/Miss Jo/JO</b></font>)</div>said Jo hastily, for she (<font color='blue'><b>Jo</b></font>) knew he (<font color='blue'><b>Professor</b></font>) was looking
at her (<font color='blue'><b>Jo</b></font>). Her (<font color='blue'><b>Jo</b></font>) bonnet wasn't big enough to hide her (<font color='blue'><b>Jo</b></font>) face, and she (<font color='blue'><b>Jo</b></font>) feared
he (<font color='blue'><b>Professor</b></font>) might think the joy it betrayed unmaidenly.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Did you believe that I should go with no farewell to those who haf
been so heavenly kind to me?''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Professor</b></font>) asked so reproachfully that she (<font color='blue'><b>Jo</b></font>) felt
as if she (<font color='blue'><b>Jo</b></font>) had insulted him (<font color='blue'><b>Professor</b></font>) by the suggestion, and answered heartily...

<p/><div class="bookquote">``No, I didn't. I knew you were busy about your own affairs, but we
rather missed you, Father and Mother especially.''

 (<font color='red'><b>him</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``And you?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I'm always glad to see you, sir.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Jo/Miss Jo/JO</b></font>)</div><p/>In her (<font color='blue'><b>Jo</b></font>) anxiety to keep her (<font color='blue'><b>Jo</b></font>) voice quite calm, Jo made it rather cool,
and the frosty little monosyllable at the end seemed to chill the
Professor, for his (<font color='blue'><b>Professor</b></font>) smile vanished, as he (<font color='blue'><b>Professor</b></font>) said gravely...

<p/><div class="bookquote">``I thank you, and come one more time before I go.''

 (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``You are going, then?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I haf no longer any business here, it is done.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Successfully, I hope?''  (<font color='red'><b>Jo/Miss Jo/JO</b></font>)</div>said Jo, for the bitterness of disappointment
was in that short reply of his (<font color='blue'><b>Professor</b></font>).

<p/><div class="bookquote">``I ought to think so, for I haf a way opened to me by which I can make
my bread and gif my Junglings much help.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Tell me, please! I like to know all about the--the boys,''  (<font color='red'><b>Jo/Miss Jo/JO</b></font>)</div>said Jo
eagerly.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``That is so kind, I gladly tell you. My friends find for me a place in
a college, where I teach as at home, and earn enough to make the way
smooth for Franz and Emil. For this I should be grateful, should I
not?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Indeed you should. How splendid it will be to have you doing what you
like, and be able to see you often, and the boys!''  (<font color='red'><b>Jo/Miss Jo/JO</b></font>)</div>cried Jo, clinging
to the lads as an excuse for the satisfaction she (<font color='blue'><b>Jo</b></font>) could not help
betraying.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Ah! But we shall not meet often, I fear, this place is at the West.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``So far away!''  (<font color='red'><b>Jo/Miss Jo/JO</b></font>)</div>and Jo left her (<font color='blue'><b>Jo</b></font>) skirts to their fate, as if it didn't
matter now what became of her (<font color='blue'><b>Jo</b></font>) clothes or herself.

<p/>Mr. Bhaer could read several languages, but he (<font color='blue'><b>Bhaer</b></font>) had not learned to read
women yet. He (<font color='blue'><b>Bhaer</b></font>) flattered himself that he (<font color='blue'><b>Bhaer</b></font>) knew Jo pretty well, and was,
therefore, much amazed by the contradictions of voice, face, and
manner, which she (<font color='blue'><b>Jo</b></font>) showed him (<font color='blue'><b>Bhaer</b></font>) in rapid succession that day, for she (<font color='blue'><b>Jo</b></font>) was
in half a dozen different moods in the course of half an hour. When
she (<font color='blue'><b>Jo</b></font>) met him (<font color='blue'><b>Bhaer</b></font>) she (<font color='blue'><b>Jo</b></font>) looked surprised, though it was impossible to help
suspecting that she (<font color='blue'><b>Jo</b></font>) had come for that express purpose. When he (<font color='blue'><b>Bhaer</b></font>) offered
her (<font color='blue'><b>Jo</b></font>) his (<font color='blue'><b>Bhaer</b></font>) arm, she (<font color='blue'><b>Jo</b></font>) took it with a look that filled him (<font color='blue'><b>Bhaer</b></font>) with delight, but
when he (<font color='blue'><b>Bhaer</b></font>) asked if she (<font color='blue'><b>Jo</b></font>) missed him (<font color='blue'><b>Bhaer</b></font>), she (<font color='blue'><b>Jo</b></font>) gave such a chilly, formal reply
that despair fell upon him (<font color='blue'><b>Bhaer</b></font>). On learning his (<font color='blue'><b>Bhaer</b></font>) good fortune she (<font color='blue'><b>Jo</b></font>) almost
clapped her (<font color='blue'><b>Jo</b></font>) hands. Was the joy all for the boys? Then on hearing his (<font color='blue'><b>Bhaer</b></font>)
destination, she (<font color='blue'><b>Jo</b></font>) said, <div class="bookquote">``So far away!''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>in a tone of despair that lifted
him (<font color='blue'><b>Bhaer</b></font>) on to a pinnacle of hope, but the next minute she (<font color='blue'><b>Jo</b></font>) tumbled him (<font color='blue'><b>Bhaer</b></font>) down
again by observing, like one entirely absorbed in the matter...

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Here's the place for my errands. Will you come in? It won't take
long.''

 (<font color='red'><b>him</b></font>)</div><p/>Jo rather prided herself upon her (<font color='blue'><b>Jo</b></font>) shopping capabilities, and
particularly wished to impress her (<font color='blue'><b>Jo</b></font>) escort with the neatness and
dispatch with which she (<font color='blue'><b>Jo</b></font>) would accomplish the business. But owing to the
flutter she (<font color='blue'><b>Jo</b></font>) was in, everything went amiss. She (<font color='blue'><b>Jo</b></font>) upset the tray of
needles, forgot the silesia was to be `twilled' till it was cut off,
gave the wrong change, and covered herself with confusion by asking for
lavender ribbon at the calico counter. Mr. Bhaer stood by, watching
her (<font color='blue'><b>Jo</b></font>) blush and blunder, and as he (<font color='blue'><b>Bhaer</b></font>) watched, his (<font color='blue'><b>Bhaer</b></font>) own bewilderment seemed
to subside, for he (<font color='blue'><b>Bhaer</b></font>) was beginning to see that on some occasions, women,
like dreams, go by contraries.

<p/>When they came out, he (<font color='blue'><b>Bhaer</b></font>) put the parcel under his (<font color='blue'><b>Bhaer</b></font>) arm with a more
cheerful aspect, and splashed through the puddles as if he (<font color='blue'><b>Bhaer</b></font>) rather
enjoyed it on the whole.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Should we no do a little what you call shopping for the babies, and
haf a farewell feast tonight if I go for my last call at your so
pleasant home?''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Bhaer</b></font>) asked, stopping before a window full of fruit and
flowers.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``What will we buy?''  (<font color='red'><b>Jo/Miss Jo/JO</b></font>)</div>asked Jo, ignoring the latter part of his (<font color='blue'><b>Bhaer</b></font>) speech,
and sniffing the mingled odors with an affectation of delight as they
went in.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``May they haf oranges and figs?''  (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Bhaer</b></font>)</div>asked Mr. Bhaer, with a paternal air.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``They eat them when they can get them.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Do you care for nuts?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Like a squirrel.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Hamburg grapes. Yes, we shall drink to the Fatherland in those?''

 (<font color='red'><b>Jo/Miss Jo/JO</b></font>)</div><p/>Jo frowned upon that piece of extravagance, and asked why he (<font color='blue'><b>Bhaer</b></font>) didn't buy
a frail of dates, a cask of raisins, and a bag of almonds, and be done
with it? Whereat Mr. Bhaer confiscated her (<font color='blue'><b>Jo</b></font>) purse, produced his (<font color='blue'><b>Bhaer</b></font>) own,
and finished the marketing by buying several pounds of grapes, a pot of
rosy daisies, and a pretty jar of honey, to be regarded in the light of
a demijohn. Then distorting his (<font color='blue'><b>Bhaer</b></font>) pockets with knobby bundles, and
giving her (<font color='blue'><b>Jo</b></font>) the flowers to hold, he (<font color='blue'><b>Bhaer</b></font>) put up the old umbrella, and they
traveled on again.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Miss Marsch, I haf a great favor to ask of you,''  (<font color='red'><b>the Professor</b></font>)</div>began the Professor,
after a moist promenade of half a block.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Yes, sir?''  (<font color='red'><b>Jo/Miss Jo/JO</b></font>)</div>and Jo's heart began to beat so hard she (<font color='blue'><b>Jo</b></font>) was afraid he (<font color='blue'><b>Professor</b></font>)
would hear it.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``I am bold to say it in spite of the rain, because so short a time
remains to me.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Yes, sir,''  (<font color='red'><b>Jo/Miss Jo/JO</b></font>)</div>and Jo nearly crushed the small flowerpot with the sudden
squeeze she (<font color='blue'><b>Jo</b></font>) gave it.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``I wish to get a little dress for my Tina, and I am too stupid to go
alone. Will you kindly gif me a word of taste and help?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Yes, sir,''  (<font color='red'><b>Jo/Miss Jo/JO</b></font>)</div>and Jo felt as calm and cool all of a sudden as if she (<font color='blue'><b>Jo</b></font>) had
stepped into a refrigerator.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Perhaps also a shawl for Tina's mother, she (<font color='blue'><b>Tina</b></font>) is so poor and sick, and
the husband is such a care. Yes, yes, a thick, warm shawl would be a
friendly thing to take the little mother.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I'll do it with pleasure, Mr. Bhaer.''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``I'm going very fast, and he (<font color='blue'><b>Bhaer</b></font>)'s
getting dearer every minute,''  (<font color='red'><b>Jo/Miss Jo/JO</b></font>)</div>added Jo to herself, then with a mental
shake she (<font color='blue'><b>Jo</b></font>) entered into the business with an energy that was pleasant to
behold.

<p/>Mr. Bhaer left it all to her (<font color='blue'><b>Jo</b></font>), so she (<font color='blue'><b>Jo</b></font>) chose a pretty gown for Tina, and
then ordered out the shawls. The clerk, being a married man,
condescended to take an interest in the couple, who appeared to be
shopping for their family.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Your lady may prefer this. It's a superior article, a most desirable
color, quite chaste and genteel,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) said, shaking out a comfortable
gray shawl, and throwing it over Jo's shoulders.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Does this suit you, Mr. Bhaer?''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Jo</b></font>) asked, turning her (<font color='blue'><b>Jo</b></font>) back to him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>),
and feeling deeply grateful for the chance of hiding her (<font color='blue'><b>Jo</b></font>) face.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Excellently well, we will haf it,''  (<font color='red'><b>the Professor</b></font>)</div>answered the Professor, smiling to
himself as he (<font color='blue'><b>Professor</b></font>) paid for it, while Jo continued to rummage the counters
like a confirmed bargain-hunter.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Now shall we go home?''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Professor</b></font>) asked, as if the words were very pleasant to
him (<font color='blue'><b>Professor</b></font>).

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Yes, it's late, and I'm _so_ tired.''  (<font color='red'><b>Jo/Miss Jo/JO</b></font>)</div>Jo's voice was more pathetic than
she (<font color='blue'><b>Jo</b></font>) knew. For now the sun seemed to have gone in as suddenly as it
came out, and the world grew muddy and miserable again, and for the
first time she (<font color='blue'><b>Jo</b></font>) discovered that her (<font color='blue'><b>Jo</b></font>) feet were cold, her (<font color='blue'><b>Jo</b></font>) head ached, and
that her (<font color='blue'><b>Jo</b></font>) heart was colder than the former, fuller of pain than the
latter. Mr. Bhaer was going away, he (<font color='blue'><b>Bhaer</b></font>) only cared for her (<font color='blue'><b>Jo</b></font>) as a friend,
it was all a mistake, and the sooner it was over the better. With this
idea in her (<font color='blue'><b>Jo</b></font>) head, she (<font color='blue'><b>Jo</b></font>) hailed an approaching omnibus with such a hasty
gesture that the daisies flew out of the pot and were badly damaged.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``This is not our omniboos,''  (<font color='red'><b>the Professor</b></font>)</div>said the Professor, waving the loaded
vehicle away, and stopping to pick up the poor little flowers.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``I beg your pardon. I didn't see the name distinctly. Never mind, I
can walk. I'm used to plodding in the mud,''  (<font color='red'><b>Jo/Miss Jo/JO</b></font>)</div>returned Jo, winking hard,
because she (<font color='blue'><b>Jo</b></font>) would have died rather than openly wipe her (<font color='blue'><b>Jo</b></font>) eyes.

<p/>Mr. Bhaer saw the drops on her (<font color='blue'><b>Jo</b></font>) cheeks, though she (<font color='blue'><b>Jo</b></font>) turned her (<font color='blue'><b>Jo</b></font>) head away.
The sight seemed to touch him (<font color='blue'><b>Bhaer</b></font>) very much, for suddenly stooping down, he (<font color='blue'><b>Bhaer</b></font>)
asked in a tone that meant a great deal, <div class="bookquote">``Heart's dearest, why do you
cry?''

 (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div><p/>Now, if Jo had not been new to this sort of thing she (<font color='blue'><b>Jo</b></font>) would have said
she (<font color='blue'><b>Jo</b></font>) wasn't crying, had a cold in her (<font color='blue'><b>Jo</b></font>) head, or told any other feminine
fib proper to the occasion. Instead of which, that undignified
creature answered, with an irrepressible sob, <div class="bookquote">``Because you are going
away.''

 (<font color='red'><b>creature</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Ach, mein Gott, that is so good!''  (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Bhaer</b></font>)</div>cried Mr. Bhaer, managing to clasp
his (<font color='blue'><b>Bhaer</b></font>) hands in spite of the umbrella and the bundles, <div class="bookquote">``Jo, I haf nothing
but much love to gif you. I came to see if you could care for it, and
I waited to be sure that I was something more than a friend. Am I?
Can you make a little place in your heart for old Fritz?''  (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Bhaer</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Bhaer</b></font>) added, all
in one breath.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Oh, yes!''  (<font color='red'><b>Jo/Miss Jo/JO</b></font>)</div>said Jo, and he (<font color='blue'><b>Bhaer</b></font>) was quite satisfied, for she (<font color='blue'><b>Jo</b></font>) folded both
hands over his (<font color='blue'><b>Bhaer</b></font>) arm, and looked up at him (<font color='blue'><b>Bhaer</b></font>) with an expression that
plainly showed how happy she (<font color='blue'><b>Jo</b></font>) would be to walk through life beside him (<font color='blue'><b>Bhaer</b></font>),
even though she (<font color='blue'><b>Jo</b></font>) had no better shelter than the old umbrella, if he (<font color='blue'><b>Bhaer</b></font>)
carried it.

<p/>It was certainly proposing under difficulties, for even if he (<font color='blue'><b>Bhaer</b></font>) had
desired to do so, Mr. Bhaer could not go down upon his (<font color='blue'><b>Bhaer</b></font>) knees, on
account of the mud. Neither could he (<font color='blue'><b>Bhaer</b></font>) offer Jo his (<font color='blue'><b>Bhaer</b></font>) hand, except
figuratively, for both were full. Much less could he (<font color='blue'><b>Bhaer</b></font>) indulge in tender
remonstrations in the open street, though he (<font color='blue'><b>Bhaer</b></font>) was near it. So the only
way in which he (<font color='blue'><b>Bhaer</b></font>) could express his (<font color='blue'><b>Bhaer</b></font>) rapture was to look at her (<font color='blue'><b>Jo</b></font>), with an
expression which glorified his (<font color='blue'><b>Bhaer</b></font>) face to such a degree that there
actually seemed to be little rainbows in the drops that sparkled on his (<font color='blue'><b>Bhaer</b></font>)
beard. If he (<font color='blue'><b>Bhaer</b></font>) had not loved Jo very much, I don't think he (<font color='blue'><b>Bhaer</b></font>) could have
done it then, for she (<font color='blue'><b>Jo</b></font>) looked far from lovely, with her (<font color='blue'><b>Jo</b></font>) skirts in a
deplorable state, her (<font color='blue'><b>Jo</b></font>) rubber boots splashed to the ankle, and her (<font color='blue'><b>Jo</b></font>)
bonnet a ruin. Fortunately, Mr. Bhaer considered her (<font color='blue'><b>Jo</b></font>) the most
beautiful woman living, and she (<font color='blue'><b>Jo</b></font>) found him (<font color='blue'><b>Bhaer</b></font>) more <div class="bookquote">``Jove-like''  (<font color='red'><b>him</b></font>)</div>than ever,
though his (<font color='blue'><b>Bhaer</b></font>) hatbrim was quite limp with the little rills trickling
thence upon his (<font color='blue'><b>Bhaer</b></font>) shoulders -LRB-for he (<font color='blue'><b>Bhaer</b></font>) held the umbrella all over Jo-RRB-, and
every finger of his (<font color='blue'><b>Bhaer</b></font>) gloves needed mending.

<p/>Passers-by probably thought them a pair of harmless lunatics, for they
entirely forgot to hail a bus, and strolled leisurely along, oblivious
of deepening dusk and fog. Little they cared what anybody thought, for
they were enjoying the happy hour that seldom comes but once in any
life, the magical moment which bestows youth on the old, beauty on the
plain, wealth on the poor, and gives human hearts a foretaste of
heaven. The Professor looked as if he (<font color='blue'><b>Professor</b></font>) had conquered a kingdom, and the
world had nothing more to offer him (<font color='blue'><b>Professor</b></font>) in the way of bliss. While Jo
trudged beside him (<font color='blue'><b>Professor</b></font>), feeling as if her (<font color='blue'><b>Jo</b></font>) place had always been there, and
wondering how she (<font color='blue'><b>Jo</b></font>) ever could have chosen any other lot. Of course, she (<font color='blue'><b>Jo</b></font>)
was the first to speak--intelligibly, I mean, for the emotional remarks
which followed her (<font color='blue'><b>Jo</b></font>) impetuous <div class="bookquote">``Oh, yes!''  (<font color='red'><b>her</b></font>)</div>were not of a coherent or
reportable character.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Friedrich, why didn't you...''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Ah, heaven, she (<font color='blue'><b>Jo</b></font>) gifs me the name that no one speaks since Minna died!''
 (<font color='red'><b>the Professor</b></font>)</div>cried the Professor, pausing in a puddle to regard her (<font color='blue'><b>Jo</b></font>) with grateful
delight.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``I always call you so to myself--I forgot, but I won't unless you like
it.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Like it? It is more sweet to me than I can tell. Say `thou', also,
and I shall say your language is almost as beautiful as mine.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Isn't `thou' a little sentimental?''  (<font color='red'><b>Jo/Miss Jo/JO</b></font>)</div>asked Jo, privately thinking it a
lovely monosyllable.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Sentimental? Yes. Thank Gott, we Germans believe in sentiment, and
keep ourselves young mit it. Your English `you' is so cold, say
`thou', heart's dearest, it means so much to me,''  (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Bhaer</b></font>)</div>pleaded Mr. Bhaer,
more like a romantic student than a grave professor.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Well, then, why didn't thou tell me all this sooner?''  (<font color='red'><b>Jo/Miss Jo/JO</b></font>)</div>asked Jo
bashfully.

<p/>``Now I shall haf to show thee all my heart, and I so gladly will,
because thou must take care of it hereafter. See, then, my Jo--ah, the
dear, funny little name--I had a wish to tell something the day I said
goodbye in New York, but I thought the handsome friend was betrothed to
thee, and so I spoke not. Wouldst thou have said <div class="bookquote">``Yes', then, if I had
spoken?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I don't know. I'm afraid not, for I didn't have any heart just then.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/>``Prut! That I do not believe. It was asleep till the fairy prince
came through the wood, and waked it up. Ah, well, <div class="bookquote">``Die erste Liebe ist
die beste', but that I should not expect.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Yes, the first love is the best, but be so contented, for I never had
another. Teddy was only a boy, and soon got over his (<font color='blue'><b>Teddy</b></font>) little fancy,''
 (<font color='red'><b>Jo/Miss Jo/JO</b></font>)</div>said Jo, anxious to correct the Professor's mistake.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Good! Then I shall rest happy, and be sure that thou givest me all.
I haf waited so long, I am grown selfish, as thou wilt find,
Professorin.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I like that,''  (<font color='red'><b>Jo/Miss Jo/JO</b></font>)</div>cried Jo, delighted with her (<font color='blue'><b>Jo</b></font>) new name. <div class="bookquote">``Now tell me
what brought you, at last, just when I wanted you?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``This,''  (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Bhaer</b></font>)</div>and Mr. Bhaer took a little worn paper out of his (<font color='blue'><b>Bhaer</b></font>) waistcoat
pocket.

<p/>Jo unfolded it, and looked much abashed, for it was one of her (<font color='blue'><b>Jo</b></font>) own
contributions to a paper that paid for poetry, which accounted for her (<font color='blue'><b>Jo</b></font>)
sending it an occasional attempt.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``How could that bring you?''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Jo</b></font>) asked, wondering what he (<font color='blue'><b>Bhaer</b></font>) meant.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``I found it by chance. I knew it by the names and the initials, and in
it there was one little verse that seemed to call me. Read and find
him (<font color='blue'><b>I</b></font>). I will see that you go not in the wet.''


 (<font color='red'><b>children</b></font>)</div><p/>IN THE GARRET

<p/>Four little chests all in a row,
Dim with dust, and worn by time,
All fashioned and filled, long ago,
By children now in their prime.
Four little keys hung side by side,
With faded ribbons, brave and gay
When fastened there, with childish pride,
Long ago, on a rainy day.
Four little names, one on each lid,
Carved out by a boyish hand,
And underneath there lieth hid
Histories of the happy band
Once playing here, and pausing oft
To hear the sweet refrain,
That came and went on the roof aloft,
In the falling summer rain.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Meg''  (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div>on the first lid, smooth and fair.
I look in with loving eyes,
For folded here, with well-known care,
A goodly gathering lies,
The record of a peaceful life--
Gifts to gentle child and girl,
A bridal gown, lines to a wife,
A tiny shoe, a baby curl.
No toys in this first chest remain,
For all are carried away,
In their old age, to join again
In another small Meg's play.
Ah, happy mother! Well I know
You hear, like a sweet refrain,
Lullabies ever soft and low
In the falling summer rain.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Jo''  (<font color='red'><b>fairy</b></font>)</div>on the next lid, scratched and worn,
And within a motley store
Of headless dolls, of schoolbooks torn,
Birds and beasts that speak no more,
Spoils brought home from the fairy ground
Only trod by youthful feet,
Dreams of a future never found,
Memories of a past still sweet,
Half-writ poems, stories wild,
April letters, warm and cold,
Diaries of a wilful child,
Hints of a woman early old,
A woman in a lonely home,
Hearing, like a sad refrain--
<div class="bookquote">``Be worthy, love, and love will come,''
 (<font color='red'><b>A woman</b></font>)</div>In the falling summer rain.

<p/>My Beth! the dust is always swept
From the lid that bears your name,
As if by loving eyes that wept,
By careful hands that often came.
Death canonized for us one saint,
Ever less human than divine,
And still we lay, with tender plaint,
Relics in this household shrine--
The silver bell, so seldom rung,
The little cap which last she (<font color='blue'><b>Beth</b></font>) wore,
The fair, dead Catherine that hung
By angels borne above her (<font color='blue'><b>Catherine</b></font>) door.
The songs she (<font color='blue'><b>Catherine</b></font>) sang, without lament,
In her (<font color='blue'><b>Catherine</b></font>) prison-house of pain,
Forever are they sweetly blent
With the falling summer rain.

<p/>Upon the last lid's polished field--
Legend now both fair and true
A gallant knight bears on his (<font color='blue'><b>knight</b></font>) shield,
<div class="bookquote">``Amy''  (<font color='red'><b>Legend A knight</b></font>)</div>in letters gold and blue.
Within lie snoods that bound her (<font color='blue'><b>Catherine</b></font>) hair,
Slippers that have danced their last,
Faded flowers laid by with care,
Fans whose airy toils are past,
Gay valentines, all ardent flames,
Trifles that have borne their part
In girlish hopes and fears and shames,
The record of a maiden heart
Now learning fairer, truer spells,
Hearing, like a blithe refrain,
The silver sound of bridal bells
In the falling summer rain.

<p/>Four little chests all in a row,
Dim with dust, and worn by time,
Four women, taught by weal and woe
To love and labor in their prime.
Four sisters, parted for an hour,
None lost, one only gone before,
Made by love's immortal power,
Nearest and dearest evermore.
Oh, when these hidden stores of ours
Lie open to the Father's sight,
May they be rich in golden hours,
Deeds that show fairer for the light,
Lives whose brave music long shall ring,
Like a spirit-stirring strain,
Souls that shall gladly soar and sing
In the long sunshine after rain.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``It's very bad poetry, but I felt it when I wrote it, one day when I
was very lonely, and had a good cry on a rag bag. I never thought it
would go where it could tell tales,''  (<font color='red'><b>Jo/Miss Jo/JO</b></font>)</div>said Jo, tearing up the verses the
Professor had treasured so long.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Let it go, it has done its duty, and I will haf a fresh one when I
read all the brown book in which she (<font color='blue'><b>Amy</b></font>) keeps her (<font color='blue'><b>Amy</b></font>) little secrets,''  (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Bhaer</b></font>)</div>said
Mr. Bhaer with a smile as he (<font color='blue'><b>Bhaer</b></font>) watched the fragments fly away on the
wind. <div class="bookquote">``Yes,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Bhaer</b></font>) added earnestly, ``I read that, and I think to myself,
She (<font color='blue'><b>Amy</b></font>) has a sorrow, she (<font color='blue'><b>Amy</b></font>) is lonely, she (<font color='blue'><b>Amy</b></font>) would find comfort in true love.
I haf a heart full, full for her (<font color='blue'><b>Amy</b></font>). Shall I not go and say, <div class="bookquote">``If this is
not too poor a thing to gif for what I shall hope to receive, take it
in Gott's name?'''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``And so you came to find that it was not too poor, but the one precious
thing I needed,''  (<font color='red'><b>Jo/Miss Jo/JO</b></font>)</div>whispered Jo.

<p/>``I had no courage to think that at first, heavenly kind as was your
welcome to me. But soon I began to hope, and then I said, ``I will haf
her (<font color='blue'><b>Amy</b></font>) if I die for it,<div class="bookquote">'' and so I will!''  (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div>cried Mr. Bhaer, with a defiant
nod, as if the walls of mist closing round them were barriers which he (<font color='blue'><b>Bhaer</b></font>)
was to surmount or valiantly knock down.

<p/>Jo thought that was splendid, and resolved to be worthy of her (<font color='blue'><b>Jo</b></font>) knight,
though he (<font color='blue'><b>knight</b></font>) did not come prancing on a charger in gorgeous array.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``What made you stay away so long?''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Jo</b></font>) asked presently, finding it so
pleasant to ask confidential questions and get delightful answers that
she (<font color='blue'><b>Jo</b></font>) could not keep silent.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``It was not easy, but I could not find the heart to take you from that
so happy home until I could haf a prospect of one to gif you, after
much time, perhaps, and hard work. How could I ask you to gif up so
much for a poor old fellow, who has no fortune but a little learning?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I'm glad you are poor. I couldn't bear a rich husband,''  (<font color='red'><b>Jo/Miss Jo/JO</b></font>)</div>said Jo
decidedly, adding in a softer tone, <div class="bookquote">``Don't fear poverty. I've known it
long enough to lose my dread and be happy working for those I love, and
don't call yourself old--forty is the prime of life. I couldn't help
loving you if you were seventy!''

 (<font color='red'><b>Jo/Miss Jo/JO</b></font>)</div><p/>The Professor found that so touching that he (<font color='blue'><b>Professor</b></font>) would have been glad of
his (<font color='blue'><b>Professor</b></font>) handkerchief, if he (<font color='blue'><b>Professor</b></font>) could have got at it. As he (<font color='blue'><b>Professor</b></font>) couldn't, Jo wiped
his (<font color='blue'><b>Professor</b></font>) eyes for him (<font color='blue'><b>Professor</b></font>), and said, laughing, as she (<font color='blue'><b>Jo</b></font>) took away a bundle or
two...

<p/><div class="bookquote">``I may be strong-minded, but no one can say I'm out of my sphere now,
for woman's special mission is supposed to be drying tears and bearing
burdens. I'm to carry my share, Friedrich, and help to earn the home.
Make up your mind to that, or I'll never go,''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Jo</b></font>) added resolutely, as
he (<font color='blue'><b>Professor</b></font>) tried to reclaim his (<font color='blue'><b>Professor</b></font>) load.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``We shall see. Haf you patience to wait a long time, Jo? I must go
away and do my work alone. I must help my boys first, because, even
for you, I may not break my word to Minna. Can you forgif that, and be
happy while we hope and wait?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Yes, I know I can, for we love one another, and that makes all the
rest easy to bear. I have my duty, also, and my work. I couldn't enjoy
myself if I neglected them even for you, so there's no need of hurry or
impatience. You can do your part out West, I can do mine here, and
both be happy hoping for the best, and leaving the future to be as God
wills.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Ah! Thou gifest me such hope and courage, and I haf nothing to gif
back but a full heart and these empty hands,''  (<font color='red'><b>the Professor</b></font>)</div>cried the Professor,
quite overcome.

<p/>Jo never, never would learn to be proper, for when he (<font color='blue'><b>Professor</b></font>) said that as they
stood upon the steps, she (<font color='blue'><b>Jo</b></font>) just put both hands into his (<font color='blue'><b>Professor</b></font>), whispering
tenderly, <div class="bookquote">``Not empty now,''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>and stooping down, kissed her (<font color='blue'><b>Jo</b></font>) Friedrich
under the umbrella. It was dreadful, but she (<font color='blue'><b>Jo</b></font>) would have done it if the
flock of draggle-tailed sparrows on the hedge had been human beings,
for she (<font color='blue'><b>Jo</b></font>) was very far gone indeed, and quite regardless of everything
but her (<font color='blue'><b>Jo</b></font>) own happiness. Though it came in such a very simple guise, that
was the crowning moment of both their lives, when, turning from the
night and storm and loneliness to the household light and warmth and
peace waiting to receive them, with a glad <div class="bookquote">``Welcome home!''  (<font color='red'><b>Jo/Miss Jo/JO</b></font>)</div>Jo led her (<font color='blue'><b>Jo</b></font>)
lover in, and shut the door.



<p/>CHAPTER FORTY-SEVEN

<p/>HARVEST TIME

<p/>For a year Jo and her (<font color='blue'><b>Jo</b></font>) Professor worked and waited, hoped and loved, met
occasionally, and wrote such voluminous letters that the rise in the
price of paper was accounted for, Laurie said. The second year began
rather soberly, for their prospects did not brighten, and Aunt March
died suddenly. But when their first sorrow was over--for they loved
the old lady in spite of her (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) sharp tongue--they found they had cause
for rejoicing, for she (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) had left Plumfield to Jo, which made all sorts
of joyful things possible.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``It's a fine old place, and will bring a handsome sum, for of course
you intend to sell it,''  (<font color='red'><b>Laurie/Mr. Laurie/LAURIE</b></font>)</div>said Laurie, as they were all talking the
matter over some weeks later.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``No, I don't,''  (<font color='red'><b>Jo/Miss Jo/JO</b></font>)</div>was Jo's decided answer, as she (<font color='blue'><b>Jo</b></font>) petted the fat poodle,
whom she (<font color='blue'><b>Jo</b></font>) had adopted, out of respect to his (<font color='blue'><b>Laurie</b></font>) former mistress.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``You don't mean to live there?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Yes, I do.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``But, my dear girl, it's an immense house, and will take a power of
money to keep it in order. The garden and orchard alone need two or
three men, and farming isn't in Bhaer's line, I take it.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``He (<font color='blue'><b>men</b></font>)'ll try his (<font color='blue'><b>men</b></font>) hand at it there, if I propose it.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``And you expect to live on the produce of the place? Well, that sounds
paradisiacal, but you'll find it desperate hard work.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``The crop we are going to raise is a profitable one,''  (<font color='red'><b>Jo/Miss Jo/JO</b></font>)</div>and Jo laughed.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Of what is this fine crop to consist, ma'am?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Boys. I want to open a school for little lads--a good, happy,
homelike school, with me to take care of them and Fritz to teach them.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``That's a truly Joian plan for you! Isn't that just like her (<font color='blue'><b>it</b></font>)?''  (<font color='red'><b>Laurie/Mr. Laurie/LAURIE</b></font>)</div>cried
Laurie, appealing to the family, who looked as much surprised as he (<font color='blue'><b>Laurie</b></font>).

<p/><div class="bookquote">``I like it,''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>said Mrs. March decidedly.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``So do I,''  (<font color='red'><b>husband</b></font>)</div>added her (<font color='blue'><b>Jo</b></font>) husband, who welcomed the thought of a chance for
trying the Socratic method of education on modern youth.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``It will be an immense care for Jo,''  (<font color='red'><b>Meg</b></font>)</div>said Meg, stroking the head of her (<font color='blue'><b>Meg</b></font>)
one all-absorbing son.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Jo can do it, and be happy in it. It's a splendid idea. Tell us all
about it,''  (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Laurence/Laurence/LAURENCE</b></font>)</div>cried Mr. Laurence, who had been longing to lend the lovers
a hand, but knew that they would refuse his (<font color='blue'><b>Laurence</b></font>) help.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``I knew you'd stand by me, sir. Amy does too--I see it in her (<font color='blue'><b>Amy</b></font>) eyes,
though she (<font color='blue'><b>Amy</b></font>) prudently waits to turn it over in her (<font color='blue'><b>Amy</b></font>) mind before she (<font color='blue'><b>Amy</b></font>)
speaks. Now, my dear people,''  (<font color='red'><b>Jo/Miss Jo/JO</b></font>)</div>continued Jo earnestly, <div class="bookquote">``just understand
that this isn't a new idea of mine, but a long cherished plan. Before
my Fritz came, I used to think how, when I'd made my fortune, and no
one needed me at home, I'd hire a big house, and pick up some poor,
forlorn little lads who hadn't any mothers, and take care of them, and
make life jolly for them before it was too late. I see so many going
to ruin for want of help at the right minute, I love so to do anything
for them, I seem to feel their wants, and sympathize with their
troubles, and oh, I should so like to be a mother to them!''

 (<font color='red'><b>Jo/Miss Jo/JO</b></font>)</div><p/>Mrs. March held out her (<font color='blue'><b>Jo</b></font>) hand to Jo, who took it, smiling, with tears in
her (<font color='blue'><b>Jo</b></font>) eyes, and went on in the old enthusiastic way, which they had not
seen for a long while.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``I told my plan to Fritz once, and he (<font color='blue'><b>Fritz</b></font>) said it was just what he (<font color='blue'><b>Fritz</b></font>) would
like, and agreed to try it when we got rich. Bless his (<font color='blue'><b>Fritz</b></font>) dear heart,
he (<font color='blue'><b>Fritz</b></font>)'s been doing it all his (<font color='blue'><b>Fritz</b></font>) life--helping poor boys, I mean, not getting
rich, that he (<font color='blue'><b>Fritz</b></font>)'ll never be. Money doesn't stay in his (<font color='blue'><b>Fritz</b></font>) pocket long
enough to lay up any. But now, thanks to my good old aunt, who loved
me better than I ever deserved, I'm rich, at least I feel so, and we
can live at Plumfield perfectly well, if we have a flourishing school.
It's just the place for boys, the house is big, and the furniture
strong and plain. There's plenty of room for dozens inside, and
splendid grounds outside. They could help in the garden and orchard.
Such work is healthy, isn't it, sir? Then Fritz could train and teach
in his (<font color='blue'><b>Fritz</b></font>) own way, and Father will help him (<font color='blue'><b>Father</b></font>). I can feed and nurse and pet
and scold them, and Mother will be my stand-by. I've always longed for
lots of boys, and never had enough, now I can fill the house full and
revel in the little dears to my heart's content. Think what luxury--
Plumfield my own, and a wilderness of boys to enjoy it with me.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Jo/Miss Jo/JO</b></font>)</div><p/>As Jo waved her (<font color='blue'><b>Jo</b></font>) hands and gave a sigh of rapture, the family went off
into a gale of merriment, and Mr. Laurence laughed till they thought
he (<font color='blue'><b>Laurence</b></font>)'d have an apoplectic fit.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``I don't see anything funny,''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Jo</b></font>) said gravely, when she (<font color='blue'><b>Jo</b></font>) could be
heard. <div class="bookquote">``Nothing could be more natural and proper than for my Professor
to open a school, and for me to prefer to reside in my own estate.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``She (<font color='blue'><b>Mother</b></font>) is putting on airs already,''  (<font color='red'><b>Laurie/Mr. Laurie/LAURIE</b></font>)</div>said Laurie, who regarded the idea in
the light of a capital joke. <div class="bookquote">``But may I inquire how you intend to
support the establishment? If all the pupils are little ragamuffins,
I'm afraid your crop won't be profitable in a worldly sense, Mrs.
Bhaer.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Now don't be a wet-blanket, Teddy. Of course I shall have rich
pupils, also--perhaps begin with such altogether. Then, when I've got
a start, I can take in a ragamuffin or two, just for a relish. Rich
people's children often need care and comfort, as well as poor. I've
seen unfortunate little creatures left to servants, or backward ones
pushed forward, when it's real cruelty. Some are naughty through
mismanagment or neglect, and some lose their mothers. Besides, the best
have to get through the hobbledehoy age, and that's the very time they
need most patience and kindness. People laugh at them, and hustle them
about, try to keep them out of sight, and expect them to turn all at
once from pretty children into fine young men. They don't complain
much--plucky little souls--but they feel it. I've been through
something of it, and I know all about it. I've a special interest in
such young bears, and like to show them that I see the warm, honest,
well-meaning boys' hearts, in spite of the clumsy arms and legs and the
topsy-turvy heads. I've had experience, too, for haven't I brought up
one boy to be a pride and honor to his (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>) family?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I'll testify that you tried to do it,''  (<font color='red'><b>Laurie/Mr. Laurie/LAURIE</b></font>)</div>said Laurie with a grateful
look.

<p/>``And I've succeeded beyond my hopes, for here you are, a steady,
sensible businessman, doing heaps of good with your money, and laying
up the blessings of the poor, instead of dollars. But you are not
merely a businessman, you love good and beautiful things, enjoy them
yourself, and let others go halves, as you always did in the old times.
I am proud of you, Teddy, for you get better every year, and everyone
feels it, though you won't let them say so. Yes, and when I have my
flock, I'll just point to you, and say <div class="bookquote">``There's your model, my lads'.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Laurie/Mr. Laurie/LAURIE</b></font>)</div><p/>Poor Laurie didn't know where to look, for, man though he (<font color='blue'><b>Laurie</b></font>) was,
something of the old bashfulness came over him (<font color='blue'><b>Laurie</b></font>) as this burst of praise
made all faces turn approvingly upon him (<font color='blue'><b>Laurie</b></font>).

<p/><div class="bookquote">``I say, Jo, that's rather too much,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Laurie</b></font>) began, just in his (<font color='blue'><b>Laurie</b></font>) old boyish
way. <div class="bookquote">``You have all done more for me than I can ever thank you for,
except by doing my best not to disappoint you. You have rather cast me
off lately, Jo, but I've had the best of help, nevertheless. So, if
I've got on at all, you may thank these two for it,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>and he (<font color='blue'><b>Laurie</b></font>) laid one
hand gently on his (<font color='blue'><b>Laurie</b></font>) grandfather's head, and the other on Amy's golden
one, for the three were never far apart.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``I do think that families are the most beautiful things in all the
world!''  (<font color='red'><b>Jo/Miss Jo/JO</b></font>)</div>burst out Jo, who was in an unusually up-lifted frame of mind
just then. <div class="bookquote">``When I have one of my own, I hope it will be as happy as
the three I know and love the best. If John and my Fritz were only
here, it would be quite a little heaven on earth,''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Jo</b></font>) added more
quietly. And that night when she (<font color='blue'><b>Jo</b></font>) went to her (<font color='blue'><b>Jo</b></font>) room after a blissful
evening of family counsels, hopes, and plans, her (<font color='blue'><b>Jo</b></font>) heart was so full of
happiness that she (<font color='blue'><b>Jo</b></font>) could only calm it by kneeling beside the empty bed
always near her (<font color='blue'><b>Jo</b></font>) own, and thinking tender thoughts of Beth.

<p/>It was a very astonishing year altogether, for things seemed to happen
in an unusually rapid and delightful manner. Almost before she (<font color='blue'><b>Beth</b></font>) knew
where she (<font color='blue'><b>Beth</b></font>) was, Jo found herself married and settled at Plumfield. Then
a family of six or seven boys sprung up like mushrooms, and flourished
surprisingly, poor boys as well as rich, for Mr. Laurence was
continually finding some touching case of destitution, and begging the
Bhaers to take pity on the child, and he (<font color='blue'><b>Laurence</b></font>) would gladly pay a trifle for
its support. In this way, the sly old gentleman got round proud Jo,
and furnished her (<font color='blue'><b>Jo</b></font>) with the style of boy in which she (<font color='blue'><b>Jo</b></font>) most delighted.

<p/>Of course it was uphill work at first, and Jo made queer mistakes, but
the wise Professor steered her (<font color='blue'><b>Jo</b></font>) safely into calmer waters, and the most
rampant ragamuffin was conquered in the end. How Jo did enjoy her (<font color='blue'><b>Jo</b></font>)
`wilderness of boys', and how poor, dear Aunt March would have lamented
had she (<font color='blue'><b>Jo</b></font>) been there to see the sacred precincts of prim, well-ordered
Plumfield overrun with Toms, Dicks, and Harrys! There was a sort of
poetic justice about it, after all, for the old lady had been the
terror of the boys for miles around, and now the exiles feasted freely
on forbidden plums, kicked up the gravel with profane boots unreproved,
and played cricket in the big field where the irritable `cow with a
crumpled horn' used to invite rash youths to come and be tossed. It
became a sort of boys' paradise, and Laurie suggested that it should be
called the ``Bhaer-garten', as a compliment to its master and
appropriate to its inhabitants.

<p/>It never was a fashionable school, and the Professor did not lay up a
fortune, but it was just what Jo intended it to be--'a happy, homelike
place for boys, who needed teaching, care, and kindness'. Every room
in the big house was soon full. Every little plot in the garden soon
had its owner. A regular menagerie appeared in barn and shed, for pet
animals were allowed. And three times a day, Jo smiled at her (<font color='blue'><b>Jo</b></font>) Fritz
from the head of a long table lined on either side with rows of happy
young faces, which all turned to her (<font color='blue'><b>Jo</b></font>) with affectionate eyes, confiding
words, and grateful hearts, full of love for ``Mother Bhaer'. She (<font color='blue'><b>Bhaer</b></font>) had
boys enough now, and did not tire of them, though they were not angels,
by any means, and some of them caused both Professor and Professorin
much trouble and anxiety. But her (<font color='blue'><b>Bhaer</b></font>) faith in the good spot which exists
in the heart of the naughtiest, sauciest, most tantalizing little
ragamuffin gave her (<font color='blue'><b>Bhaer</b></font>) patience, skill, and in time success, for no mortal
boy could hold out long with Father Bhaer shining on him (<font color='blue'><b>Father</b></font>) as
benevolently as the sun, and Mother Bhaer forgiving him (<font color='blue'><b>Father</b></font>) seventy times
seven. Very precious to Jo was the friendship of the lads, their
penitent sniffs and whispers after wrongdoing, their droll or touching
little confidences, their pleasant enthusiasms, hopes, and plans, even
their misfortunes, for they only endeared them to her (<font color='blue'><b>Jo</b></font>) all the more.
There were slow boys and bashful boys, feeble boys and riotous boys,
boys that lisped and boys that stuttered, one or two lame ones, and a
merry little quadroon, who could not be taken in elsewhere, but who was
welcome to the ``Bhaer-garten', though some people predicted that his (<font color='blue'><b>boys</b></font>)
admission would ruin the school.

<p/>Yes, Jo was a very happy woman there, in spite of hard work, much
anxiety, and a perpetual racket. She (<font color='blue'><b>Jo</b></font>) enjoyed it heartily and found the
applause of her (<font color='blue'><b>Jo</b></font>) boys more satisfying than any praise of the world, for
now she (<font color='blue'><b>Jo</b></font>) told no stories except to her (<font color='blue'><b>Jo</b></font>) flock of enthusiastic believers
and admirers. As the years went on, two little lads of her (<font color='blue'><b>Jo</b></font>) own came to
increase her (<font color='blue'><b>Jo</b></font>) happiness--Rob, named for Grandpa, and Teddy, a
happy-go-lucky baby, who seemed to have inherited his (<font color='blue'><b>Teddy</b></font>) papa's sunshiny
temper as well as his (<font color='blue'><b>Teddy</b></font>) mother's lively spirit. How they ever grew up
alive in that whirlpool of boys was a mystery to their grandma and
aunts, but they flourished like dandelions in spring, and their rough
nurses loved and served them well.

<p/>There were a great many holidays at Plumfield, and one of the most
delightful was the yearly apple-picking. For then the Marches,
Laurences, Brookes and Bhaers turned out in full force and made a day
of it. Five years after Jo's wedding, one of these fruitful festivals
occurred, a mellow October day, when the air was full of an
exhilarating freshness which made the spirits rise and the blood dance
healthily in the veins. The old orchard wore its holiday attire.
Goldenrod and asters fringed the mossy walls. Grasshoppers skipped
briskly in the sere grass, and crickets chirped like fairy pipers at a
feast. Squirrels were busy with their small harvesting. Birds
twittered their adieux from the alders in the lane, and every tree
stood ready to send down its shower of red or yellow apples at the
first shake. Everybody was there. Everybody laughed and sang, climbed
up and tumbled down. Everybody declared that there never had been such
a perfect day or such a jolly set to enjoy it, and everyone gave
themselves up to the simple pleasures of the hour as freely as if there
were no such things as care or sorrow in the world.

<p/>Mr. March strolled placidly about, quoting Tusser, Cowley, and
Columella to Mr. Laurence, while enjoying...

<p/>The gentle apple's winey juice.

<p/>The Professor charged up and down the green aisles like a stout
Teutonic knight, with a pole for a lance, leading on the boys, who made
a hook and ladder company of themselves, and performed wonders in the
way of ground and lofty tumbling. Laurie devoted himself to the little
ones, rode his (<font color='blue'><b>Laurie</b></font>) small daughter in a bushel-basket, took Daisy up among
the bird's nests, and kept adventurous Rob from breaking his (<font color='blue'><b>Rob</b></font>) neck.
Mrs. March and Meg sat among the apple piles like a pair of Pomonas,
sorting the contributions that kept pouring in, while Amy with a
beautiful motherly expression in her (<font color='blue'><b>Amy</b></font>) face sketched the various groups,
and watched over one pale lad, who sat adoring her (<font color='blue'><b>Amy</b></font>) with his (<font color='blue'><b>lad</b></font>) little
crutch beside him (<font color='blue'><b>lad</b></font>).

<p/>Jo was in her (<font color='blue'><b>Jo</b></font>) element that day, and rushed about, with her (<font color='blue'><b>Jo</b></font>) gown pinned
up, and her (<font color='blue'><b>Jo</b></font>) hat anywhere but on her (<font color='blue'><b>Jo</b></font>) head, and her (<font color='blue'><b>Jo</b></font>) baby tucked under her (<font color='blue'><b>Jo</b></font>)
arm, ready for any lively adventure which might turn up. Little Teddy
bore a charmed life, for nothing ever happened to him (<font color='blue'><b>Teddy</b></font>), and Jo never
felt any anxiety when he (<font color='blue'><b>Teddy</b></font>) was whisked up into a tree by one lad,
galloped off on the back of another, or supplied with sour russets by
his (<font color='blue'><b>Teddy</b></font>) indulgent papa, who labored under the Germanic delusion that babies
could digest anything, from pickled cabbage to buttons, nails, and
their own small shoes. She (<font color='blue'><b>Jo</b></font>) knew that little Ted would turn up again in
time, safe and rosy, dirty and serene, and she (<font color='blue'><b>Jo</b></font>) always received him (<font color='blue'><b>Ted</b></font>) back
with a hearty welcome, for Jo loved her (<font color='blue'><b>Jo</b></font>) babies tenderly.

<p/>At four o'clock a lull took place, and baskets remained empty, while
the apple pickers rested and compared rents and bruises. Then Jo and
Meg, with a detachment of the bigger boys, set forth the supper on the
grass, for an out-of-door tea was always the crowning joy of the day.
The land literally flowed with milk and honey on such occasions, for
the lads were not required to sit at table, but allowed to partake of
refreshment as they liked--freedom being the sauce best beloved by the
boyish soul. They availed themselves of the rare privilege to the
fullest extent, for some tried the pleasing experiment of drinking milk
while standing on their heads, others lent a charm to leapfrog by
eating pie in the pauses of the game, cookies were sown broadcast over
the field, and apple turnovers roosted in the trees like a new style of
bird. The little girls had a private tea party, and Ted roved among
the edibles at his (<font color='blue'><b>Ted</b></font>) own sweet will.

<p/>When no one could eat any more, the Professor proposed the first
regular toast, which was always drunk at such times--<div class="bookquote">``Aunt March, God
bless her (<font color='blue'><b>Aunt</b></font>)!''  (<font color='red'><b>the Professor</b></font>)</div>A toast heartily given by the good man, who never forgot
how much he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) owed her (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>), and quietly drunk by the boys, who had been
taught to keep her (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) memory green.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Now, Grandma's sixtieth birthday! Long life to her (<font color='blue'><b>Aunt</b></font>), with three times
three!''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/>That was given with a will, as you may well believe, and the cheering
once begun, it was hard to stop it. Everybody's health was proposed,
from Mr. Laurence, who was considered their special patron, to the
astonished guinea pig, who had strayed from its proper sphere in search
of its young master. Demi, as the oldest grandchild, then presented
the queen of the day with various gifts, so numerous that they were
transported to the festive scene in a wheelbarrow. Funny presents,
some of them, but what would have been defects to other eyes were
ornaments to Grandma's--for the children's gifts were all their own.
Every stitch Daisy's patient little fingers had put into the
handkerchiefs she (<font color='blue'><b>Daisy</b></font>) hemmed was better than embroidery to Mrs. March.
Demi's miracle of mechanical skill, though the cover wouldn't shut,
Rob's footstool had a wiggle in its uneven legs that she (<font color='blue'><b>Demi</b></font>) declared was
soothing, and no page of the costly book Amy's child gave her (<font color='blue'><b>Amy</b></font>) was so
fair as that on which appeared in tipsy capitals, the words--<div class="bookquote">``To dear
Grandma, from her (<font color='blue'><b>Grandma</b></font>) little Beth.''

 (<font color='red'><b>her</b></font>)</div><p/>During the ceremony the boys had mysteriously disappeared, and when
Mrs. March had tried to thank her (<font color='blue'><b>Amy</b></font>) children, and broken down, while
Teddy wiped her (<font color='blue'><b>Amy</b></font>) eyes on his (<font color='blue'><b>Teddy</b></font>) pinafore, the Professor suddenly began to
sing. Then, from above him (<font color='blue'><b>Professor</b></font>), voice after voice took up the words, and
from tree to tree echoed the music of the unseen choir, as the boys
sang with all their hearts the little song that Jo had written, Laurie
set to music, and the Professor trained his (<font color='blue'><b>Professor</b></font>) lads to give with the best
effect. This was something altogether new, and it proved a grand
success, for Mrs. March couldn't get over her (<font color='blue'><b>Jo</b></font>) surprise, and insisted on
shaking hands with every one of the featherless birds, from tall Franz
and Emil to the little quadroon, who had the sweetest voice of all.

<p/>After this, the boys dispersed for a final lark, leaving Mrs. March and
her (<font color='blue'><b>Jo</b></font>) daughters under the festival tree.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``I don't think I ever ought to call myself `unlucky Jo' again, when my
greatest wish has been so beautifully gratified,''  (<font color='red'><b>Mrs. Bhaer</b></font>)</div>said Mrs. Bhaer,
taking Teddy's little fist out of the milk pitcher, in which he (<font color='blue'><b>pitcher</b></font>) was
rapturously churning.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``And yet your life is very different from the one you pictured so long
ago. Do you remember our castles in the air?''  (<font color='red'><b>Amy/Amy March</b></font>)</div>asked Amy, smiling as
she (<font color='blue'><b>Amy</b></font>) watched Laurie and John playing cricket with the boys.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Dear fellows! It does my heart good to see them forget business and
frolic for a day,''  (<font color='red'><b>Jo/Miss Jo/JO</b></font>)</div>answered Jo, who now spoke in a maternal way of all
mankind. <div class="bookquote">``Yes, I remember, but the life I wanted then seems selfish,
lonely, and cold to me now. I haven't given up the hope that I may
write a good book yet, but I can wait, and I'm sure it will be all the
better for such experiences and illustrations as these,''  (<font color='red'><b>Jo/Miss Jo/JO</b></font>)</div>and Jo pointed
from the lively lads in the distance to her (<font color='blue'><b>Jo</b></font>) father, leaning on the
Professor's arm, as they walked to and fro in the sunshine, deep in one
of the conversations which both enjoyed so much, and then to her (<font color='blue'><b>Jo</b></font>)
mother, sitting enthroned among her (<font color='blue'><b>Jo</b></font>) daughters, with their children in
her (<font color='blue'><b>Jo</b></font>) lap and at her (<font color='blue'><b>Jo</b></font>) feet, as if all found help and happiness in the face
which never could grow old to them.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``My castle was the most nearly realized of all. I asked for splendid
things, to be sure, but in my heart I knew I should be satisfied, if I
had a little home, and John, and some dear children like these. I've
got them all, thank God, and am the happiest woman in the world,''  (<font color='red'><b>Meg</b></font>)</div>and
Meg laid her (<font color='blue'><b>Meg</b></font>) hand on her (<font color='blue'><b>Meg</b></font>) tall boy's head, with a face full of tender
and devout content.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``My castle is very different from what I planned, but I would not alter
it, though, like Jo, I don't relinquish all my artistic hopes, or
confine myself to helping others fulfill their dreams of beauty. I've
begun to model a figure of baby, and Laurie says it is the best thing
I've ever done. I think so, myself, and mean to do it in marble, so
that, whatever happens, I may at least keep the image of my little
angel.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Amy/Amy March</b></font>)</div><p/>As Amy spoke, a great tear dropped on the golden hair of the sleeping
child in her (<font color='blue'><b>Amy</b></font>) arms, for her (<font color='blue'><b>Amy</b></font>) one well-beloved daughter was a frail little
creature and the dread of losing her (<font color='blue'><b>Amy</b></font>) was the shadow over Amy's
sunshine. This cross was doing much for both father and mother, for
one love and sorrow bound them closely together. Amy's nature was
growing sweeter, deeper, and more tender. Laurie was growing more
serious, strong, and firm, and both were learning that beauty, youth,
good fortune, even love itself, cannot keep care and pain, loss and
sorrow, from the most blessed for ...


<p/>Into each life some rain must fall,
Some days must be dark and sad and dreary.


<p/><div class="bookquote">``She (<font color='blue'><b>Jo</b></font>) is growing better, I am sure of it, my dear. Don't despond, but
hope and keep happy,''  (<font color='red'><b>Daisy</b></font>)</div>said Mrs. March, as tenderhearted Daisy stooped
from her (<font color='blue'><b>Daisy</b></font>) knee to lay her (<font color='blue'><b>Daisy</b></font>) rosy cheek against her (<font color='blue'><b>Daisy</b></font>) little cousin's pale
one.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``I never ought to, while I have you to cheer me up, Marmee, and Laurie
to take more than half of every burden,''  (<font color='red'><b>Amy/Amy March</b></font>)</div>replied Amy warmly. ``He (<font color='blue'><b>Laurie</b></font>) never
lets me see his (<font color='blue'><b>Laurie</b></font>) anxiety, but is so sweet and patient with me, so
devoted to Beth, and such a stay and comfort to me always that I can't
love him (<font color='blue'><b>Laurie</b></font>) enough. So, in spite of my one cross, I can say with Meg,
<div class="bookquote">``Thank God, I'm a happy woman.'''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``There's no need for me to say it, for everyone can see that I'm far
happier than I deserve,''  (<font color='red'><b>Jo/Miss Jo/JO</b></font>)</div>added Jo, glancing from her (<font color='blue'><b>Jo</b></font>) good husband to
her (<font color='blue'><b>Jo</b></font>) chubby children, tumbling on the grass beside her (<font color='blue'><b>Jo</b></font>). <div class="bookquote">``Fritz is
getting gray and stout. I'm growing as thin as a shadow, and am
thirty. We never shall be rich, and Plumfield may burn up any night,
for that incorrigible Tommy Bangs will smoke sweet-fern cigars under
the bed-clothes, though he (<font color='blue'><b>Bangs</b></font>)'s set himself afire three times already.
But in spite of these unromantic facts, I have nothing to complain of,
and never was so jolly in my life. Excuse the remark, but living among
boys, I can't help using their expressions now and then.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Yes, Jo, I think your harvest will be a good one,''  (<font color='red'><b>Teddy</b></font>)</div>began Mrs. March,
frightening away a big black cricket that was staring Teddy out of
countenance.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Not half so good as yours, Mother. Here it is, and we never can thank
you enough for the patient sowing and reaping you have done,''  (<font color='red'><b>Jo/Miss Jo/JO</b></font>)</div>cried Jo,
with the loving impetuosity which she (<font color='blue'><b>Jo</b></font>) never would outgrow.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``I hope there will be more wheat and fewer tares every year,''  (<font color='red'><b>Amy/Amy March</b></font>)</div>said Amy
softly.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``A large sheaf, but I know there's room in your heart for it, Marmee
dear,''  (<font color='red'><b>Meg</b></font>)</div>added Meg's tender voice.

<p/>Touched to the heart, Mrs. March could only stretch out her (<font color='blue'><b>Amy</b></font>) arms, as if
to gather children and grandchildren to herself, and say, with face and
voice full of motherly love, gratitude, and humility...

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Oh, my girls, however long you may live, I never can wish you a
greater happiness than this!''
