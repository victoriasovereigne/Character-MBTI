<p/>I'd never given much thought to how I would die  though I'd had reason enough in the last few months
 but even if I had, I would not have imagined it like this.

<p/>I stared without breathing across the long room, into the dark eyes of the hunter, and he (<font color='blue'><b>hunter</b></font>) looked
pleasantly back at me.
Surely it was a good way to die, in the place of someone else, someone I loved. Noble, even. That ought
to count for something.
I knew that if I'd never gone to Forks, I wouldn't be facing death now. But, terrified as I was, I couldn't
bring myself to regret the decision. When life offers you a dream so far beyond any of your expectations,
it's not reasonable to grieve when it comes to an end.
The hunter smiled in a friendly way as he (<font color='blue'><b>hunter</b></font>) sauntered forward to kill me.

<p/>1. FIRST SIGHT

<p/>My mother drove me to the airport with the windows rolled down. It was seventy-five degrees in
Phoenix, the sky a perfect, cloudless blue. I was wearing my favorite shirt  sleeveless, white eyelet
lace; I was wearing it as a farewell gesture. My carry-on item was a parka.
In the Olympic Peninsula of northwest Washington State, a small town named Forks exists under a
near-constant cover of clouds. It rains on this inconsequential town more than any other place in the
United States of America. It was from this town and its gloomy, omnipresent shade that my mother
escaped with me when I was only a few months old. It was in this town that I'd been compelled to spend
a month every summer until I was fourteen. That was the year I finally put my foot down; these past three
summers, my dad, Charlie, vacationed with me in California for two weeks instead.
It was to Forks that I now exiled myself an action that I took with great horror. I detested Forks.
I loved Phoenix. I loved the sun and the blistering heat. I loved the vigorous, sprawling city.
<div class="bookquote">``Bella,''  (<font color='red'><b>mom</b></font>)</div>my mom said to me  the last of a thousand times  before I got on the plane. <div class="bookquote">``You don't have
to do this.''
 (<font color='red'><b>mom</b></font>)</div>My mom looks like me, except with short hair and laugh lines. I felt a spasm of panic as I stared at her (<font color='blue'><b>mom</b></font>)
wide, childlike eyes. How could I leave my loving, erratic, harebrained mother to fend for herself? Of
course she (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) had Phil now, so the bills would probably get paid, there would be food in the refrigerator,
gas in her (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) car, and someone to call when she (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) got lost, but still
<div class="bookquote">``I want to go,''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>I lied. I'd always been a bad liar, but I'd been saying this lie so frequently lately that it
sounded almost convincing now.
<div class="bookquote">``Tell Charlie I said hi.''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``I will.''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``I'll see you soon,''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) insisted. <div class="bookquote">``You can come home whenever you want  I'll come right back as soon
as you need me.''
 (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div>But I could see the sacrifice in her (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) eyes behind the promise.
<div class="bookquote">``Don't worry about me,''  (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div>I urged. <div class="bookquote">``It'll be great. I love you, Mom.''

 (<font color='red'><b>She</b></font>)</div><p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) hugged me tightly for a minute, and then I got on the plane, and she (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) was gone.
It's a four-hour flight from Phoenix to Seattle, another hour in a small plane up to Port Angeles, and then
an hour drive back down to Forks. Flying doesn't bother me; the hour in the car with Charlie, though, I
was a little worried about.
Charlie had really been fairly nice about the whole thing. He (<font color='blue'><b>Charlie</b></font>) seemed genuinely pleased that I was coming
to live with him (<font color='blue'><b>Charlie</b></font>) for the first time with any degree of permanence. He (<font color='blue'><b>Charlie</b></font>)'d already gotten me registered for
high school and was going to help me get a car.
But it was sure to be awkward with Charlie. Neither of us was what anyone would call verbose, and I
didn't know what there was to say regardless. I knew he (<font color='blue'><b>Charlie</b></font>) was more than a little confused by my decision
 like my mother before me, I hadn't made a secret of my distaste for Forks.
When I landed in Port Angeles, it was raining. I didn't see it as an omen  just unavoidable. I'd already
said my goodbyes to the sun.
Charlie was waiting for me with the cruiser. This I was expecting, too. Charlie is Police Chief Swan to the
good people of Forks. My primary motivation behind buying a car, despite the scarcity of my funds, was
that I refused to be driven around town in a car with red and blue lights on top. Nothing slows down
traffic like a cop.
Charlie gave me an awkward, one-armed hug when I stumbled my way off the plane.
<div class="bookquote">``It's good to see you, Bells,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Charlie</b></font>) said, smiling as he (<font color='blue'><b>Charlie</b></font>) automatically caught and steadied me. <div class="bookquote">``You haven't
changed much. How's Rene?''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``Mom's fine. It's good to see you, too, Dad.''  (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div>I wasn't allowed to call him (<font color='blue'><b>Charlie</b></font>) Charlie to his (<font color='blue'><b>Charlie</b></font>) face.
I had only a few bags. Most of my Arizona clothes were too permeable for Washington. My mom and I
had pooled our resources to supplement my winter wardrobe, but it was still scanty. It all fit easily into
the trunk of the cruiser.
<div class="bookquote">``I found a good car for you, really cheap,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Charlie</b></font>) announced when we were strapped in.
<div class="bookquote">``What kind of car?''  (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div>I was suspicious of the way he (<font color='blue'><b>Charlie</b></font>) said <div class="bookquote">``good car for you''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>as opposed to just <div class="bookquote">``good
car.''
 (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``Well, it's a truck actually, a Chevy.''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``Where did you find it?''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``Do you remember Billy Black down at La Push?''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>La Push is the tiny Indian reservation on the coast.
<div class="bookquote">``No.''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``He (<font color='blue'><b>Black</b></font>) used to go fishing with us during the summer,''  (<font color='red'><b>Charlie</b></font>)</div>Charlie prompted.
That would explain why I didn't remember him (<font color='blue'><b>Charlie</b></font>). I do a good job of blocking painful, unnecessary things
from my memory.
<div class="bookquote">``He (<font color='blue'><b>Black</b></font>)'s in a wheelchair now,''  (<font color='red'><b>Charlie</b></font>)</div>Charlie continued when I didn't respond, <div class="bookquote">``so he (<font color='blue'><b>Black</b></font>) can't drive anymore, and he (<font color='blue'><b>Black</b></font>)
offered to sell me his (<font color='blue'><b>Black</b></font>) truck cheap.''
 (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``What year is it?''  (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div>I could see from his (<font color='blue'><b>Charlie</b></font>) change of expression that this was the question he (<font color='blue'><b>Charlie</b></font>) was hoping I

<p/>wouldn't ask.
<div class="bookquote">``Well, Billy's done a lot of work on the engine  it's only a few years old, really.''
 (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div>I hoped he (<font color='blue'><b>Charlie</b></font>) didn't think so little of me as to believe I would give up that easily. <div class="bookquote">``When did he (<font color='blue'><b>Billy</b></font>) buy it?''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``He (<font color='blue'><b>Billy</b></font>) bought it in 1984, I think.''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``Did he (<font color='blue'><b>Billy</b></font>) buy it new?''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``Well, no. I think it was new in the early sixties  or late fifties at the earliest,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Charlie</b></font>) admitted sheepishly.
<div class="bookquote">``Ch  Dad, I don't really know anything about cars. I wouldn't be able to fix it if anything went wrong,
and I couldn't afford a mechanic''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``Really, Bella, the thing runs great. They don't build them like that anymore.''
 (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div>The thing, I thought to myself it had possibilities  as a nickname, at the very least.
<div class="bookquote">``How cheap is cheap?''  (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div>After all, that was the part I couldn't compromise on.
<div class="bookquote">``Well, honey, I kind of already bought it for you. As a homecoming gift.''  (<font color='red'><b>Charlie</b></font>)</div>Charlie peeked sideways at me
with a hopeful expression.
Wow. Free.
<div class="bookquote">``You didn't need to do that, Dad. I was going to buy myself a car.''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``I don't mind. I want you to be happy here.''  (<font color='red'><b>He</b></font>)</div>He (<font color='blue'><b>Charlie</b></font>) was looking ahead at the road when he (<font color='blue'><b>Charlie</b></font>) said this. Charlie
wasn't comfortable with expressing his (<font color='blue'><b>Charlie</b></font>) emotions out loud. I inherited that from him (<font color='blue'><b>Charlie</b></font>). So I was looking
straight ahead as I responded.
<div class="bookquote">``That's really nice, Dad. Thanks. I really appreciate it.''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>No need to add that my being happy in Forks is
an impossibility. He (<font color='blue'><b>Charlie</b></font>) didn't need to suffer along with me. And I never looked a free truck in the mouth 
or engine.
<div class="bookquote">``Well, now, you're welcome,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Charlie</b></font>) mumbled, embarrassed by my thanks.
We exchanged a few more comments on the weather, which was wet, and that was pretty much it for
Conversation. We stared out the windows in silence.
It was beautiful, of course; I couldn't deny that. Everything was green: the trees, their trunks covered with
moss, their branches hanging with a canopy of it, the ground covered with ferns. Even the air filtered
down greenly through the leaves.
It was too green  an alien planet.
Eventually we made it to Charlie's. He (<font color='blue'><b>Charlie</b></font>) still lived in the small, two-bedroom house that he (<font color='blue'><b>Charlie</b></font>)'d bought with
my mother in the early days of their marriage. Those were the only kind of days their marriage had  the
early ones. There, parked on the street in front of the house that never changed, was my new  well,
new to me  truck. It was a faded red color, with big, rounded fenders and a bulbous cab. To my
intense surprise, I loved it. I didn't know if it would run, but I could see myself in it. Plus, it was one of
those solid iron affairs that never gets damaged  the kind you see at the scene of an accident, paint
unscratched, surrounded by the pieces of the foreign car it had destroyed.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Wow, Dad, I love it! Thanks!''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>Now my horrific day tomorrow would be just that much less dreadful. I
wouldn't be faced with the choice of either walking two miles in the rain to school or accepting a ride in
the Chief's cruiser.
<div class="bookquote">``I'm glad you like it,''  (<font color='red'><b>Charlie</b></font>)</div>Charlie said gruffly, embarrassed again.
It took only one trip to get all my stuff upstairs. I got the west bedroom that faced out over the front yard.
The room was familiar; it had been belonged to me since I was born. The wooden floor, the light blue
walls, the peaked ceiling, the yellowed lace curtains around the window  these were all a part of my
childhood. The only changes Charlie had ever made were switching the crib for a bed and adding a desk
as I grew. The desk now held a secondhand computer, with the phone line for the modem stapled along
the floor to the nearest phone jack. This was a stipulation from my mother, so that we could stay in touch
easily. The rocking chair from my baby days was still in the corner.
There was only one small bathroom at the top of the stairs, which I would have to share with Charlie. I
was trying not to dwell too much on that fact.
One of the best things about Charlie is he (<font color='blue'><b>Charlie</b></font>) doesn't hover. He (<font color='blue'><b>Charlie</b></font>) left me alone to unpack and get settled, a
feat that would have been altogether impossible for my mother. It was nice to be alone, not to have to
smile and look pleased; a relief to stare dejectedly out the window at the sheeting rain and let just a few
tears escape. I wasn't in the mood to go on a real crying jag. I would save that for bedtime, when I
would have to think about the coming morning.
Forks High School had a frightening total of only three hundred and fifty-seven  now fifty-eight 
students; there were more than seven hundred people in my junior class alone back home. All of the kids
here had grown up together  their grandparents had been toddlers together.
I would be the new girl from the big city, a curiosity, a freak.
Maybe, if I looked like a girl from Phoenix should, I could work this to my advantage. But physically, I'd
never fit in anywhere. I should be tan, sporty, blond  a volleyball player, or a cheerleader, perhaps 
all the things that go with living in the valley of the sun.
Instead, I was ivory-skinned, without even the excuse of blue eyes or red hair, despite the constant
sunshine. I had always been slender, but soft somehow, obviously not an athlete; I didn't have the
necessary hand-eye coordination to play sports without humiliating myself  and harming both myself
and anyone else who stood too close.
When I finished putting my clothes in the old pine dresser, I took my bag of bathroom necessities and
went to the communal bathroom to clean myself up after the day of travel. I looked at my face in the
mirror as I brushed through my tangled, damp hair. Maybe it was the light, but already I looked sallower,
unhealthy. My skin could be pretty  it was very clear, almost translucent-looking  but it all depended
on color. I had no color here.
Facing my pallid reflection in the mirror, I was forced to admit that I was lying to myself. It wasn't just
physically that I'd never fit in. And if I couldn't find a niche in a school with three thousand people, what
were my chances here?
I didn't relate well to people my age. Maybe the truth was that I didn't relate well to people, period. Even
my mother, who I was closer to than anyone else on the planet, was never in harmony with me, never on
exactly the same page. Sometimes I wondered if I was seeing the same things through my eyes that the
rest of the world was seeing through theirs. Maybe there was a glitch in my brain. But the cause didn't
matter. All that mattered was the effect. And tomorrow would be just the beginning.

<p/>I didn't sleep well that night, even after I was done crying. The constant whooshing of the rain and wind
across the roof wouldn't fade into the background. I pulled the faded old quilt over my head, and later
added the pillow, too. But I couldn't fall asleep until after midnight, when the rain finally settled into a
quieter drizzle.
Thick fog was all I could see out my window in the morning, and I could feel the claustrophobia creeping
up on me. You could never see the sky here; it was like a cage.
Breakfast with Charlie was a quiet event. He (<font color='blue'><b>Charlie</b></font>) wished me good luck at school. I thanked him (<font color='blue'><b>Charlie</b></font>), knowing his (<font color='blue'><b>Charlie</b></font>)
hope was wasted. Good luck tended to avoid me. Charlie left first, off to the police station that was his (<font color='blue'><b>Charlie</b></font>)
wife and family. After he (<font color='blue'><b>Charlie</b></font>) left, I sat at the old square oak table in one of the three unmatching chairs and
examined his (<font color='blue'><b>Charlie</b></font>) small kitchen, with its dark paneled walls, bright yellow cabinets, and white linoleum floor.
Nothing was changed. My mother had painted the cabinets eighteen years ago in an attempt to bring
some sunshine into the house. Over the small fireplace in the adjoining handkerchief-sized family room
was a row of pictures. First a wedding picture of Charlie and my mom in Las Vegas, then one of the
three of us in the hospital after I was born, taken by a helpful nurse, followed by the procession of my
school pictures up to last year's. Those were embarrassing to look at  I would have to see what I
could do to get Charlie to put them somewhere else, at least while I was living here.
It was impossible, being in this house, not to realize that Charlie had never gotten over my mom. It made
me uncomfortable.
I didn't want to be too early to school, but I couldn't stay in the house anymore. I donned my jacket 
which had the feel of a biohazard suit  and headed out into the rain.
It was just drizzling still, not enough to soak me through immediately as I reached for the house key that
was always hidden under the eaves by the door, and locked up. The sloshing of my new waterproof
boots was unnerving. I missed the normal crunch of gravel as I walked. I couldn't pause and admire my
truck again as I wanted; I was in a hurry to get out of the misty wet that swirled around my head and
clung to my hair under my hood.
Inside the truck, it was nice and dry. Either Billy or Charlie had obviously cleaned it up, but the tan
upholstered seats still smelled faintly of tobacco, gasoline, and peppermint. The engine started quickly, to
my relief, but loudly, roaring to life and then idling at top volume. Well, a truck this old was bound to
have a flaw. The antique radio worked, a plus that I hadn't expected.
Finding the school wasn't difficult, though I'd never been there before. The school was, like most other
things, just off the highway. It was not obvious that it was a school; only the sign, which declared it to be
the Forks High School, made me stop. It looked like a collection of matching houses, built with
maroon-colored bricks. There were so many trees and shrubs I couldn't see its size at first. Where was
the feel of the institution? I wondered nostalgically. Where were the chain-link fences, the metal
detectors?
I parked in front of the first building, which had a small sign over the door reading front office. No one
else was parked there, so I was sure it was off limits, but I decided I would get directions inside instead
of circling around in the rain like an idiot. I stepped unwillingly out of the toasty truck cab and walked
down a little stone path lined with dark hedges. I took a deep breath before opening the door.
Inside, it was brightly lit, and warmer than I'd hoped. The office was small; a little waiting area with
padded folding chairs, orange-flecked commercial carpet, notices and awards cluttering the walls, a big
clock ticking loudly. Plants grew everywhere in large plastic pots, as if there wasn't enough greenery

<p/>outside. The room was cut in half by a long counter, cluttered with wire baskets full of papers and
brightly colored flyers taped to its front. There were three desks behind the counter, one of which was
manned by a large, red-haired woman wearing glasses. She (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) was wearing a purple t-shirt, which
immediately made me feel overdressed.
The red-haired woman looked up. <div class="bookquote">``Can I help you?''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``I'm Isabella Swan,''  (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div>I informed her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>), and saw the immediate awareness light her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) eyes. I was expected, a
topic of gossip no doubt. Daughter of the Chief's flighty ex-wife, come home at last.
<div class="bookquote">``Of course,''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Daughter</b></font>) said. She (<font color='blue'><b>Daughter</b></font>) dug through a precariously stacked pile of documents on her (<font color='blue'><b>Daughter</b></font>) desk till she (<font color='blue'><b>Daughter</b></font>)
found the ones she (<font color='blue'><b>Daughter</b></font>) was looking for. <div class="bookquote">``I have your schedule right here, and a map of the school.''  (<font color='red'><b>She</b></font>)</div>She (<font color='blue'><b>Daughter</b></font>)
brought several sheets to the counter to show roe.
She (<font color='blue'><b>Daughter</b></font>) went through my classes for me, highlighting the best route to each on the map, and gave me a slip to
have each teacher sign, which I was to bring back at the end of the day. She (<font color='blue'><b>Daughter</b></font>) smiled at me and hoped,
like Charlie, that I would like it here in Forks. I smiled back as convincingly as I could.
When I went back out to my truck, other students were starting to arrive. I drove around the school,
following the line of traffic. I was glad to see that most of the cars were older like mine, nothing flashy. At
home I'd lived in one of the few lower-income neighborhoods that were included in the Paradise Valley
District. It was a common thing to see a new Mercedes or Porsche in the student lot. The nicest car here
was a shiny Volvo, and it stood out. Still, I cut the engine as soon as I was in a spot, so that the
thunderous volume wouldn't draw attention to me.
I looked at the map in the truck, trying to memorize it now; hopefully I wouldn't have to walk around with
it stuck in front of my nose all day. I stuffed everything in my bag, slung the strap over my shoulder, and
sucked in a huge breath. I can do this, I lied to myself feebly. No one was going to bite me. I finally
exhaled and stepped out of the truck.
I kept my face pulled back into my hood as I walked to the sidewalk, crowded with teenagers. My plain
black jacket didn't stand out, I noticed with relief.
Once I got around the cafeteria, building three was easy to spot. A large black <div class="bookquote">``3''  (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div>was painted on a
white square on the east corner. I felt my breathing gradually creeping toward hyperventilation as I
approached the door. I tried holding my breath as I followed two unisex raincoats through the door.
The classroom was small. The people in front of me stopped just inside the door to hang up their coats
on a long row of hooks. I copied them. They were two girls, one a porcelain-colored blonde, the other
also pale, with light brown hair. At least my skin wouldn't be a standout here.
I took the slip up to the teacher, a tall, balding man whose desk had a nameplate identifying him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) as Mr.
Mason. He (<font color='blue'><b>Mason</b></font>) gawked at me when he (<font color='blue'><b>Mason</b></font>) saw my name  not an encouraging response  and of course I
flushed tomato red. But at least he (<font color='blue'><b>Mason</b></font>) sent me to an empty desk at the back without introducing me to the
class. It was harder for my new classmates to stare at me in the back, but somehow, they managed. I
kept my eyes down on the reading list the teacher had given me. It was fairly basic: Bronte, Shakespeare,
Chaucer, Faulkner. I'd already read everything. That was comforting and boring. I wondered if my
mom would send me my folder of old essays, or if she (<font color='blue'><b>mom</b></font>) would think that was cheating. I went through
different arguments with her (<font color='blue'><b>mom</b></font>) in my head while the teacher droned on.
When the bell rang, a nasal buzzing sound, a gangly boy with skin problems and hair black as an oil slick
leaned across the aisle to talk to me.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``You're Isabella Swan, aren't you?''  (<font color='red'><b>He</b></font>)</div>He (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>) looked like the overly helpful, chess club type.
<div class="bookquote">``Bella,''  (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div>I corrected. Everyone within a three-seat radius turned to look at me.
<div class="bookquote">``Where's your next class?''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>) asked.
I had to check in my bag. <div class="bookquote">``Um, Government, with Jefferson, in building six.''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>There was nowhere to look without meeting curious eyes.
<div class="bookquote">``I'm headed toward building four, I could show you the way''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>Definitely over-helpful. <div class="bookquote">``I'm Eric,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>)
added.
I smiled tentatively. <div class="bookquote">``Thanks.''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>We got our jackets and headed out into the rain, which had picked up. I could have sworn several
people behind us were walking close enough to eavesdrop. I hoped I wasn't getting paranoid.
<div class="bookquote">``So, this is a lot different than Phoenix, huh?''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>) asked.
<div class="bookquote">``Very.''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``It doesn't rain much there, does it?''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``Three or four times a year.''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``Wow, what must that be like?''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>) wondered.
<div class="bookquote">``Sunny,''  (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div>I told him (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>).
<div class="bookquote">``You don't look very tan.''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``My mother is part albino.''
 (<font color='red'><b>He</b></font>)</div>He (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>) studied my face apprehensively, and I sighed. It looked like clouds and a sense of humor didn't mix.
A few months of this and I'd forget how to use sarcasm.
We walked back around the cafeteria, to the south buildings by the gym. Eric walked me right to the
door, though it was clearly marked.
<div class="bookquote">``Well, good luck,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Eric</b></font>) said as I touched the handle. <div class="bookquote">``Maybe we'll have some other classes together.''  (<font color='red'><b>He</b></font>)</div>He (<font color='blue'><b>Eric</b></font>)
sounded hopeful.
I smiled at him (<font color='blue'><b>Eric</b></font>) vaguely and went inside.
The rest of the morning passed in about the same fashion. My Trigonometry teacher, Mr. Varner, who I
would have hated anyway just because of the subject he (<font color='blue'><b>Varner</b></font>) taught, was the only one who made me stand in
front of the class and introduce myself. I stammered, blushed, and tripped over my own boots on the
way to my seat.
After two classes, I started to recognize several of the faces in each class. There was always someone
braver than the others who would introduce themselves and ask me questions about how I was liking
Forks. I tried to be diplomatic, but mostly I just lied a lot. At least I never needed the map.
One girl sat next to me in both Trig and Spanish, and she (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) walked with me to the cafeteria for lunch. She (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>)
was tiny, several inches shorter than my five feet four inches, but her (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) wildly curly dark hair made up a lot

<p/>of the difference between our heights. I couldn't remember her (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) name, so I smiled and nodded as she (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>)
prattled about teachers and classes. I didn't try to keep up.
We sat at the end of a full table with several of her (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) friends, who she (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) introduced to me. I forgot all their
names as soon as she (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) spoke them. They seemed impressed by her (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) bravery in speaking to me. The boy
from English, Eric, waved at me from across the room.
It was there, sitting in the lunchroom, trying to make conversation with seven curious strangers, that I first
saw them.
They were sitting in the corner of the cafeteria, as far away from where I sat as possible in the long room.
There were five of them. They weren't talking, and they weren't eating, though they each had a tray of
untouched food in front of them. They weren't gawking at me, unlike most of the other students, so it was
safe to stare at them without fear of meeting an excessively interested pair of eyes. But it was none of
these things that caught, and held, my attention.
They didn't look anything alike. Of the three boys, one was big  muscled like a serious weight lifter,
with dark, curly hair. Another was taller, leaner, but still muscular, and honey blond. The last was lanky,
less bulky, with untidy, bronze-colored hair. He (<font color='blue'><b>lifter</b></font>) was more boyish than the others, who looked like they
could be in college, or even teachers here rather than students.
The girls were opposites. The tall one was statuesque. She (<font color='blue'><b>they</b></font>) had a beautiful figure, the kind you saw on the
cover of the Sports Illustrated swimsuit issue, the kind that made every girl around her (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) take a hit on her (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>)
self-esteem just by being in the same room. Her (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) hair was golden, gently waving to the middle of her (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>)
back. The short girl was pixielike, thin in the extreme, with small features. Her (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) hair was a deep black,
cropped short and pointing in every direction.
And yet, they were all exactly alike. Every one of them was chalky pale, the palest of all the students
living in this sunless town. Paler than me, the albino. They all had very dark eyes despite the range in hair
tones. They also had dark shadows under those eyes  purplish, bruiselike shadows. As if they were all
suffering from a sleepless night, or almost done recovering from a broken nose. Though their noses, all
their features, were straight, perfect, angular.
But all this is not why I couldn't look away.
I stared because their faces, so different, so similar, were all devastatingly, inhumanly beautiful. They
were faces you never expected to see except perhaps on the airbrushed pages of a fashion magazine. Or
painted by an old master as the face of an angel. It was hard to decide who was the most beautiful 
maybe the perfect blond girl, or the bronze-haired boy.
They were all looking away  away from each other, away from the other students, away from anything
in particular as far as I could tell. As I watched, the small girl rose with her (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) tray  unopened soda,
unbitten apple  and walked away with a quick, graceful lope that belonged on a runway. I watched,
amazed at her (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) lithe dancer's step, till she (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) dumped her (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) tray and glided through the back door, faster than I
would have thought possible. My eyes darted back to the others, who sat unchanging.
<div class="bookquote">``Who are they?''  (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div>I asked the girl from my Spanish class, whose name I'd forgotten.
As she (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) looked up to see who I meant  though already knowing, probably, from my tone  suddenly
he (<font color='blue'><b>I</b></font>) looked at her (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>), the thinner one, the boyish one, the youngest, perhaps. He (<font color='blue'><b>I</b></font>) looked at my neighbor for
just a fraction of a second, and then his (<font color='blue'><b>I</b></font>) dark eyes flickered to mine.
He (<font color='blue'><b>I</b></font>) looked away quickly, more quickly than I could, though in a flush of embarrassment I dropped my

<p/>eyes at once. In that brief flash of a glance, his (<font color='blue'><b>I</b></font>) face held nothing of interest  it was as if she (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) had called
his (<font color='blue'><b>I</b></font>) name, and he (<font color='blue'><b>I</b></font>)'d looked up in involuntary response, already having decided not to answer.
My neighbor giggled in embarrassment, looking at the table like I did.
<div class="bookquote">``That's Edward and Emmett Cullen, and Rosalie and Jasper Hale. The one who left was Alice Cullen;
they all live together with Dr. Cullen and his (<font color='blue'><b>Cullen</b></font>) wife.''  (<font color='red'><b>She</b></font>)</div>She (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) said this under her (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) breath.
I glanced sideways at the beautiful boy, who was looking at his (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>) tray now, picking a bagel to pieces with
long, pale fingers. His (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>) mouth was moving very quickly, his (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>) perfect lips barely opening. The other three still
looked away, and yet I felt he (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>) was speaking quietly to them.
Strange, unpopular names, I thought. The kinds of names grandparents had. But maybe that was in vogue
here  small town names? I finally remembered that my neighbor was called Jessica, a perfectly
common name. There were two girls named Jessica in my History class back home.
<div class="bookquote">``They are very nice-looking.''  (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div>I struggled with the conspicuous understatement.
<div class="bookquote">``Yes!''  (<font color='red'><b>Jessica</b></font>)</div>Jessica agreed with another giggle. <div class="bookquote">``They're all together though  Emmett and Rosalie, and
Jasper and Alice, I mean. And they live together.''  (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div>Her (<font color='blue'><b>Jessica</b></font>) voice held all the shock and condemnation of the
small town, I thought critically. But, if I was being honest, I had to admit that even in Phoenix, it would
cause gossip.
<div class="bookquote">``Which ones are the Cullens?''  (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div>I asked. <div class="bookquote">``They don't look related''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``Oh, they're not. Dr. Cullen is really young, in his (<font color='blue'><b>Cullen</b></font>) twenties or early thirties. They're all adopted. The
Hales are brother and sister, twins  the blondes  and they're foster children.''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``They look a little old for foster children.''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``They are now, Jasper and Rosalie are both eighteen, but they've been with Mrs. Cullen since they were
eight. She (<font color='blue'><b>Cullen</b></font>)'s their aunt or something like that.''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``That's really kind of nice  for them to take care of all those kids like that, when they're so young and
everything.''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``I guess so,''  (<font color='red'><b>Jessica</b></font>)</div>Jessica admitted reluctantly, and I got the impression that she (<font color='blue'><b>Jessica</b></font>) didn't like the doctor and his (<font color='blue'><b>doctor</b></font>)
wife for some reason. With the glances she (<font color='blue'><b>Jessica</b></font>) was throwing at their adopted children, I would presume the
reason was jealousy. <div class="bookquote">``I think that Mrs. Cullen can't have any kids, though,''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Jessica</b></font>) added, as if that lessened
their kindness.
Throughout all this conversation, my eyes flickered again and again to the table where the strange family
sat. They continued to look at the walls and not eat.
<div class="bookquote">``Have they always lived in Forks?''  (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div>I asked. Surely I would have noticed them on one of my summers
here.
<div class="bookquote">``No,''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Jessica</b></font>) said in a voice that implied it should be obvious, even to a new arrival like me. <div class="bookquote">``They just
moved down two years ago from somewhere in Alaska.''
 (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div>I felt a surge of pity, and relief. Pity because, as beautiful as they were, they were outsiders, clearly not
accepted. Relief that I wasn't the only newcomer here, and certainly not the most interesting by any
standard.

<p/>As I examined them, the youngest, one of the Cullens, looked up and met my gaze, this time with evident
curiosity in his (<font color='blue'><b>newcomer</b></font>) expression. As I looked swiftly away, it seemed to me that his (<font color='blue'><b>newcomer</b></font>) glance held some kind of
unmet expectation.
<div class="bookquote">``Which one is the boy with the reddish brown hair?''  (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div>I asked. I peeked at him (<font color='blue'><b>newcomer</b></font>) from the corner of my eye,
and he (<font color='blue'><b>newcomer</b></font>) was still staring at me, but not gawking like the other students had today  he (<font color='blue'><b>newcomer</b></font>) had a slightly
frustrated expression. I looked down again.
<div class="bookquote">``That's Edward. He (<font color='blue'><b>Edward</b></font>)'s gorgeous, of course, but don't waste your time. He (<font color='blue'><b>Edward</b></font>) doesn't date. Apparently none
of the girls here are good-looking enough for him (<font color='blue'><b>Edward</b></font>).''  (<font color='red'><b>She</b></font>)</div>She (<font color='blue'><b>newcomer</b></font>) sniffed, a clear case of sour grapes. I wondered
when he (<font color='blue'><b>newcomer</b></font>)'d turned her (<font color='blue'><b>newcomer</b></font>) down.
I bit my lip to hide my smile. Then I glanced at him (<font color='blue'><b>newcomer</b></font>) again. His (<font color='blue'><b>newcomer</b></font>) face was turned away, but I thought his (<font color='blue'><b>newcomer</b></font>)
cheek appeared lifted, as if he (<font color='blue'><b>newcomer</b></font>) were smiling, too.
After a few more minutes, the four of them left the table together. They all were noticeably graceful 
even the big, brawny one. It was unsettling to watch. The one named Edward didn't look at me again.
I sat at the table with Jessica and her (<font color='blue'><b>Jessica</b></font>) friends longer than I would have if I'd been sitting alone. I was
anxious not to be late for class on my first day. One of my new acquaintances, who considerately
reminded me that her (<font color='blue'><b>Jessica</b></font>) name was Angela, had Biology II with me the next hour. We walked to class
together in silence. She (<font color='blue'><b>Jessica</b></font>) was shy, too.
When we entered the classroom, Angela went to sit at a black-topped lab table exactly like the ones I
was used to. She (<font color='blue'><b>Angela</b></font>) already had a neighbor. In fact, all the tables were filled but one. Next to the center
aisle, I recognized Edward Cullen by his (<font color='blue'><b>Cullen</b></font>) unusual hair, sitting next to that single open seat.
As I walked down the aisle to introduce myself to the teacher and get my slip signed, I was watching him (<font color='blue'><b>Cullen</b></font>)
surreptitiously. Just as I passed, he (<font color='blue'><b>Cullen</b></font>) suddenly went rigid in his (<font color='blue'><b>Cullen</b></font>) seat. He (<font color='blue'><b>Cullen</b></font>) stared at me again, meeting my
eyes with the strangest expression on his (<font color='blue'><b>Cullen</b></font>) face  it was hostile, furious. I looked away quickly, shocked,
going red again. I stumbled over a book in the walkway and had to catch myself on the edge of a table.
The girl sitting there giggled.
I'd noticed that his (<font color='blue'><b>Cullen</b></font>) eyes were black  coal black.
Mr. Banner signed my slip and handed me a book with no nonsense about introductions. I could tell we
were going to get along. Of course, he (<font color='blue'><b>Cullen</b></font>) had no choice but to send me to the one open seat in the middle
of the room. I kept my eyes down as I went to sit by him (<font color='blue'><b>Cullen</b></font>), bewildered by the antagonistic stare he (<font color='blue'><b>Cullen</b></font>)'d given
me.
I didn't look up as I set my book on the table and took my seat, but I saw his (<font color='blue'><b>Cullen</b></font>) posture change from the
corner of my eye. He (<font color='blue'><b>Cullen</b></font>) was leaning away from me, sitting on the extreme edge of his (<font color='blue'><b>Cullen</b></font>) chair and averting his (<font color='blue'><b>Cullen</b></font>)
face like he (<font color='blue'><b>Cullen</b></font>) smelled something bad. Inconspicuously, I sniffed my hair. It smelled like strawberries, the
scent of my favorite shampoo. It seemed an innocent enough odor. I let my hair fall over my right
shoulder, making a dark curtain between us, and tried to pay attention to the teacher.
Unfortunately the lecture was on cellular anatomy, something I'd already studied. I took notes carefully
anyway, always looking down.
I couldn't stop myself from peeking occasionally through the screen of my hair at the strange boy next to
me. During the whole class, he (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>) never relaxed his (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>) stiff position on the edge of his (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>) chair, sitting as far from
me as possible. I could see his (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>) hand on his (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>) left leg was clenched into a fist, tendons standing out under his (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>)
pale skin. This, too, he (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>) never relaxed. He (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>) had the long sleeves of his (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>) white shirt pushed up to his (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>) elbows,

<p/>and his (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>) forearm was surprisingly hard and muscular beneath his (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>) light skin. He (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>) wasn't nearly as slight as
he (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>)'d looked next to his (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>) burly brother.
The class seemed to drag on longer than the others. Was it because the day was finally coming to a
close, or because I was waiting for his (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>) tight fist to loosen? It never did; he (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>) continued to sit so still it
looked like he (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>) wasn't breathing. What was wrong with him (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>)? Was this his (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>) normal behavior? I questioned
my judgment on Jessica's bitterness at lunch today. Maybe she (<font color='blue'><b>Jessica</b></font>) was not as resentful as I'd thought.
It couldn't have anything to do with me. He (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>) didn't know me from Eve.
I peeked up at him (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>) one more time, and regretted it. He (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>) was glaring down at me again, his (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>) black eyes full
of revulsion. As I flinched away from him (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>), shrinking against my chair, the phrase if looks could kill
suddenly ran through my mind.
At that moment, the bell rang loudly, making me jump, and Edward Cullen was out of his (<font color='blue'><b>Cullen</b></font>) seat. Fluidly he (<font color='blue'><b>Cullen</b></font>)
rose  he (<font color='blue'><b>Cullen</b></font>) was much taller than I'd thought  his (<font color='blue'><b>Cullen</b></font>) back to me, and he (<font color='blue'><b>Cullen</b></font>) was out the door before anyone
else was out of their seat.
I sat frozen in my seat, staring blankly after him (<font color='blue'><b>Cullen</b></font>). He (<font color='blue'><b>Cullen</b></font>) was so mean. It wasn't fair. I began gathering up my
things slowly, trying to block the anger that filled me, for fear my eyes would tear up. For some reason,
my temper was hardwired to my tear ducts. I usually cried when I was angry, a humiliating tendency.
<div class="bookquote">``Aren't you Isabella Swan?''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>a male voice asked.
I looked up to see a cute, baby-faced boy, his (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>) pale blond hair carefully gelled into orderly spikes, smiling
at me in a friendly way. He (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>) obviously didn't think I smelled bad.
<div class="bookquote">``Bella,''  (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div>I corrected him (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>), with a smile.
<div class="bookquote">``I'm Mike.''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``Hi, Mike.''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``Do you need any help finding your next class?''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``I'm headed to the gym, actually. I think I can find it.''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``That's my next class, too.''  (<font color='red'><b>He</b></font>)</div>He (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>) seemed thrilled, though it wasn't that big of a coincidence in a school this
small.
We walked to class together; he (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>) was a chatterer  he (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>) supplied most of the conversation, which made it
easy for me. He (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>)'d lived in California till he (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>) was ten, so he (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>) knew how I felt about the sun. It turned out he (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>)
was in my English class also. He (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>) was the nicest person I'd met today.
But as we were entering the gym, he (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>) asked, <div class="bookquote">``So, did you stab Edward Cullen with a pencil or what? I've
never seen him (<font color='blue'><b>Cullen</b></font>) act like that.''
 (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>I cringed. So I wasn't the only one who had noticed. And, apparently, that wasn't Edward Cullen's usual
behavior. I decided to play dumb.
<div class="bookquote">``Was that the boy I sat next to in Biology?''  (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div>I asked artlessly.
<div class="bookquote">``Yes,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Cullen</b></font>) said. <div class="bookquote">``He (<font color='blue'><b>Cullen</b></font>) looked like he (<font color='blue'><b>Cullen</b></font>) was in pain or something.''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``I don't know,''  (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div>I responded. <div class="bookquote">``I never spoke to him (<font color='blue'><b>Cullen</b></font>).''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``He (<font color='blue'><b>Cullen</b></font>)'s a weird guy.''  (<font color='red'><b>Mike/Mike Newton/Newton</b></font>)</div>Mike lingered by me instead of heading to the dressing room. <div class="bookquote">``If I were lucky enough
to sit by you, I would have talked to you.''
 (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div>I smiled at him (<font color='blue'><b>Mike</b></font>) before walking through the girls' locker room door. He (<font color='blue'><b>Mike</b></font>) was friendly and clearly admiring.
But it wasn't enough to ease my irritation.
The Gym teacher, Coach Clapp, found me a uniform but didn't make me dress down for today's class.
At home, only two years of RE. were required. Here, P.E. was mandatory all four years. Forks was
literally my personal hell on Earth.
I watched four volleyball games running simultaneously. Remembering how many injuries I had sustained
 and inflicted  playing volleyball, I felt faintly nauseated.
The final bell rang at last. I walked slowly to the office to return my paperwork. The rain had drifted
away, but the wind was strong, and colder. I wrapped my arms around myself.
When I walked into the warm office, I almost turned around and walked back out.
Edward Cullen stood at the desk in front of me. I recognized again that tousled bronze hair. He (<font color='blue'><b>Cullen</b></font>) didn't
appear to notice the sound of my entrance. I stood pressed against the back wall, waiting for the
receptionist to be free.
He (<font color='blue'><b>Cullen</b></font>) was arguing with her (<font color='blue'><b>receptionist</b></font>) in a low, attractive voice. I quickly picked up the gist of the argument. He (<font color='blue'><b>gist</b></font>) was
trying to trade from sixth-hour Biology to another time  any other time.
I just couldn't believe that this was about me. It had to be something else, something that happened
before I entered the Biology room. The look on his (<font color='blue'><b>gist</b></font>) face must have been about another aggravation
entirely. It was impossible that this stranger could take such a sudden, intense dislike to me.
The door opened again, and the cold wind suddenly gusted through the room, rustling the papers on the
desk, swirling my hair around my face. The girl who came in merely stepped to the desk, placed a note in
the wire basket, and walked out again. But Edward Cullen's back stiffened, and he (<font color='blue'><b>Cullen</b></font>) turned slowly to glare
at me  his (<font color='blue'><b>Cullen</b></font>) face was absurdly handsome  with piercing, hate-filled eyes. For an instant, I felt a thrill of
genuine fear, raising the hair on my arms. The look only lasted a second, but it chilled me more than the
freezing wind. He (<font color='blue'><b>Cullen</b></font>) turned back to the receptionist.
<div class="bookquote">``Never mind, then,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Cullen</b></font>) said hastily in a voice like velvet. <div class="bookquote">``I can see that it's impossible. Thank you so
much for your help.''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>And he (<font color='blue'><b>Cullen</b></font>) turned on his (<font color='blue'><b>Cullen</b></font>) heel without another look at me, and disappeared out the
door.
I went meekly to the desk, my face white for once instead of red, and handed her (<font color='blue'><b>receptionist</b></font>) the signed slip.
<div class="bookquote">``How did your first day go, dear?''  (<font color='red'><b>the receptionist</b></font>)</div>the receptionist asked maternally.
<div class="bookquote">``Fine,''  (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div>I lied, my voice weak. She (<font color='blue'><b>receptionist</b></font>) didn't look convinced.
When I got to the truck, it was almost the last car in the lot. It seemed like a haven, already the closest
thing to home I had in this damp green hole. I sat inside for a while, just staring out the windshield
blankly. But soon I was cold enough to need the heater, so I turned the key and the engine roared to life.
I headed back to Charlie's house, fighting tears the whole way there.

<p/>2. OPEN BOOK

<p/>The next day was better and worse.
It was better because it wasn't raining yet, though the clouds were dense and opaque. It was easier
because I knew what to expect of my day. Mike came to sit by me in English, and walked me to my next
class, with Chess Club Eric glaring at him (<font color='blue'><b>Eric</b></font>) all the while; that was nattering. People didn't look at me quite
as much as they had yesterday. I sat with a big group at lunch that included Mike, Eric, Jessica, and
several other people whose names and faces I now remembered. I began to feel like I was treading
water, instead of drowning in it.
It was worse because I was tired; I still couldn't sleep with the wind echoing around the house. It was
worse because Mr. Varner called on me in Trig when my hand wasn't raised and I had the wrong
answer. It was miserable because I had to play volleyball, and the one time I didn't cringe out of the way
of the ball, I hit my teammate in the head with it. And it was worse because Edward Cullen wasn't in
school at all.
All morning I was dreading lunch, fearing his (<font color='blue'><b>Cullen</b></font>) bizarre glares. Part of me wanted to confront him (<font color='blue'><b>Cullen</b></font>) and
demand to know what his (<font color='blue'><b>Cullen</b></font>) problem was. While I was lying sleepless in my bed, I even imagined what I
would say. But I knew myself too well to think I would really have the guts to do it. I made the Cowardly
Lion look like the terminator.
But when I walked into the cafeteria with Jessica  trying to keep my eyes from sweeping the place for
him (<font color='blue'><b>Cullen</b></font>), and failing entirely  I saw that his (<font color='blue'><b>Cullen</b></font>) four siblings of sorts were sitting together at the same table, and
he (<font color='blue'><b>Cullen</b></font>) was not with them.
Mike intercepted us and steered us to his (<font color='blue'><b>Mike</b></font>) table. Jessica seemed elated by the attention, and her (<font color='blue'><b>Jessica</b></font>) friends
quickly joined us. But as I tried to listen to their easy chatter, I was terribly uncomfortable, waiting
nervously for the moment he (<font color='blue'><b>Mike</b></font>) would arrive. I hoped that he (<font color='blue'><b>Mike</b></font>) would simply ignore me when he (<font color='blue'><b>Mike</b></font>) came, and
prove my suspicions false.
He (<font color='blue'><b>Mike</b></font>) didn't come, and as time passed I grew more and more tense.
I walked to Biology with more confidence when, by the end of lunch, he (<font color='blue'><b>Mike</b></font>) still hadn't showed. Mike, who
was taking on the qualities of a golden retriever, walked faithfully by my side to class. I held my breath at
the door, but Edward Cullen wasn't there, either. I exhaled and went to my seat. Mike followed, talking
about an upcoming trip to the beach. He (<font color='blue'><b>Mike</b></font>) lingered by my desk till the bell rang. Then he (<font color='blue'><b>Mike</b></font>) smiled at me
wistfully and went to sit by a girl with braces and a bad perm. It looked like I was going to have to do
something about Mike, and it wouldn't be easy. In a town like this, where everyone lived on top of
everyone else, diplomacy was essential. I had never been enormously tactful; I had no practice dealing
with overly friendly boys.
I was relieved that I had the desk to myself, that Edward was absent. I told myself that repeatedly. But I
couldn't get rid of the nagging suspicion that I was the reason he (<font color='blue'><b>Edward</b></font>) wasn't there. It was ridiculous, and
egotistical, to think that I could affect anyone that strongly. It was impossible. And yet I couldn't stop
worrying that it was true.
When the school day was finally done, and the blush was fading out of my cheeks from the volleyball
incident, I changed quickly back into my jeans and navy blue sweater. I hurried from the girls' locker
room, pleased to find that I had successfully evaded my retriever friend for the moment. I walked swiftly
out to the parking lot. It was crowded now with fleeing students. I got in my truck and dug through my
bag to make sure I had what I needed.
Last night I'd discovered that Charlie couldn't cook much besides fried eggs and bacon. So I requested

<p/>that I be assigned kitchen detail for the duration of my stay. He (<font color='blue'><b>Charlie</b></font>) was willing enough to hand over the keys
to the banquet hall. I also found out that he (<font color='blue'><b>Charlie</b></font>) had no food in the house. So I had my shopping list and the
cash from the jar in the cupboard labeled FOOD MONEY, and I was on my way to the Thriftway.
I gunned my deafening engine to life, ignoring the heads that turned in my direction, and backed carefully
into a place in the line of cars that were waiting to exit the parking lot. As I waited, trying to pretend that
the earsplitting rumble was coming from someone else's car, I saw the two Cullens and the Hale twins
getting into their car. It was the shiny new Volvo. Of course. I hadn't noticed their clothes before  I'd
been too mesmerized by their faces. Now that I looked, it was obvious that they were all dressed
exceptionally well; simply, but in clothes that subtly hinted at designer origins. With their remarkable good
looks, the style with which they carried themselves, they could have worn dishrags and pulled it off. It
seemed excessive for them to have both looks and money. But as far as I could tell, life worked that way
most of the time. It didn't look as if it bought them any acceptance here.
No, I didn't fully believe that. The isolation must be their desire; I couldn't imagine any door that wouldn't
be opened by that degree of beauty.
They looked at my noisy truck as I passed them, just like everyone else. I kept my eyes straight forward
and was relieved when I finally was free of the school grounds.
The Thriftway was not far from the school, just a few streets south, off the highway. It was nice to be
inside the supermarket; it felt normal. I did the shopping at home, and I fell into the pattern of the familiar
task gladly. The store was big enough inside that I couldn't hear the tapping of the rain on the roof to
remind me where I was.
When I got home, I unloaded all the groceries, stuffing them in wherever I could find an open space. I
hoped Charlie wouldn't mind. I wrapped potatoes in foil and stuck them in the oven to bake, covered a
steak in marinade and balanced it on top of a carton of eggs in the fridge.
When I was finished with that, I took my book bag upstairs. Before starting my homework, I changed
into a pair of dry sweats, pulled my damp hair up into a pony-tail, and checked my e-mail for the first
time. I had three messages.
<div class="bookquote">``Bella,''  (<font color='red'><b>mom</b></font>)</div>my mom wrote

Write me as soon as you get in. Tell me how your flight was. Is it raining? I miss you already.
I'm almost finished packing for Florida, but I can't find my pink blouse. Do you know where I
put it? Phil says hi. Mom.

<p/>I sighed and went to the next. It was sent eight hours after the first.
<div class="bookquote">``Bella,''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Mom</b></font>) wrote

Why haven't you e-mailed me yet? What are you waiting for? Mom.

<p/>The last was from this morning.

<p/>Isabella,
If I haven't heard from you by 5:30 p.m. today I'm calling Charlie.

<p/>I checked the clock. I still had an hour, but my mom was well known for jumping the gun.

<p/>Mom,
Calm down. I'm writing right now. Don't do anything rash.
Bella.

<p/>I sent that, and began again.

<p/>Mom,
Everything is great. Of course it's raining. I was waiting for something to write about. School
isn't bad, just a little repetitive. I met some nice kids who sit by me at lunch.
Your blouse is at the dry cleaners - you were supposed to pick it up Friday.
Charlie bought me a truck, can you believe it? I love it. It's old, but really sturdy, which is
good, you know, for me.
I miss you, too. I'll write again soon, but I'm not going to check my e-mail every five minutes.
Relax, breathe. I love you.
Bella.

<p/>I had decided to read Wuthering Heights  the novel we were currently studying in English  yet
again for the fun of it, and that's what I was doing when Charlie came home. I'd lost track of the time,
and I hurried downstairs to take the potatoes out and put the steak in to broil.
<div class="bookquote">``Bella?''  (<font color='red'><b>father</b></font>)</div>my father called out when he (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) heard me on the stairs.
Who else? I thought to myself.
<div class="bookquote">``Hey, Dad, welcome home.''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``Thanks.''  (<font color='red'><b>He</b></font>)</div>He (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) hung up his (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) gun belt and stepped out of his (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) boots as I bustled about the kitchen. As far as I
was aware, he (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>)'d never shot the gun on the job. But he (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) kept it ready. When I came here as a child, he (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>)
would always remove the bullets as soon as he (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) walked in the door. I guess he (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) considered me old enough
now not to shoot myself by accident, and not depressed enough to shoot myself on purpose.
<div class="bookquote">``What's for dinner?''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) asked warily. My mother was an imaginative cook, and her (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) experiments weren't

<p/>always edible. I was surprised, and sad, that he (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) seemed to remember that far back.
<div class="bookquote">``Steak and potatoes,''  (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div>I answered, and he (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) looked relieved.
He (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) seemed to feel awkward standing in the kitchen doing nothing; he (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) lumbered into the living room to
watch TV while I worked. We were both more comfortable that way. I made a salad while the steaks
cooked, and set the table.
I called him (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) in when dinner was ready, and he (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) sniffed appreciatively as he (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) walked into the room.
<div class="bookquote">``Smells good, Bell.''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``Thanks.''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>We ate in silence for a few minutes. It wasn't uncomfortable. Neither of us was bothered by the quiet. In
some ways, we were well suited for living together.
<div class="bookquote">``So, how did you like school? Have you made any friends?''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) asked as he (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) was taking seconds.
<div class="bookquote">``Well, I have a few classes with a girl named Jessica. I sit with her (<font color='blue'><b>Jessica</b></font>) friends at lunch. And there's this boy,
Mike, who's very friendly. Everybody seems pretty nice.''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>With one outstanding exception.
<div class="bookquote">``That must be Mike Newton. Nice kid  nice family. His (<font color='blue'><b>Newton</b></font>) dad owns the sporting goods store just outside
of town. He (<font color='blue'><b>Newton</b></font>) makes a good living off all the backpackers who come through here.''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``Do you know the Cullen family?''  (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div>I asked hesitantly.
<div class="bookquote">``Dr. Cullen's family? Sure. Dr. Cullen's a great man.''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``They the kids are a little different. They don't seem to fit in very well at school.''
 (<font color='red'><b>Charlie</b></font>)</div>Charlie surprised me by looking angry.
<div class="bookquote">``People in this town,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Charlie</b></font>) muttered. <div class="bookquote">``Dr. Cullen is a brilliant surgeon who could probably work in any
hospital in the world, make ten times the salary he (<font color='blue'><b>Cullen</b></font>) gets here,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Charlie</b></font>) continued, getting louder. <div class="bookquote">``We're lucky
to have him (<font color='blue'><b>Cullen</b></font>)  lucky that his (<font color='blue'><b>Cullen</b></font>) wife wanted to live in a small town. He (<font color='blue'><b>Cullen</b></font>)'s an asset to the community, and all
of those kids are well behaved and polite. I had my doubts, when they first moved in, with all those
adopted teenagers. I thought we might have some problems with them. But they're all very mature  I
haven't had one speck of trouble from any of them. That's more than I can say for the children of some
folks who have lived in this town for generations. And they stick together the way a family should 
camping trips every other weekend Just because they're newcomers, people have to talk.''
 (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div>It was the longest speech I'd ever heard Charlie make. He (<font color='blue'><b>Charlie</b></font>) must feel strongly about whatever people
were saying.
I backpedaled. <div class="bookquote">``They seemed nice enough to me. I just noticed they kept to themselves. They're all very
attractive,''  (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div>I added, trying to be more complimentary.
<div class="bookquote">``You should see the doctor,''  (<font color='red'><b>Charlie</b></font>)</div>Charlie said, laughing. <div class="bookquote">``It's a good thing he (<font color='blue'><b>doctor</b></font>)'s happily married. A lot of the
nurses at the hospital have a hard time concentrating on their work with him (<font color='blue'><b>doctor</b></font>) around.''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>We lapsed back into silence as we finished eating. He (<font color='blue'><b>Charlie</b></font>) cleared the table while I started on the dishes. He (<font color='blue'><b>Charlie</b></font>)
went back to the TV, and after I finished washing the dishes by hand  no dishwasher  I went
upstairs unwillingly to work on my math homework. I could feel a tradition in the making.

<p/>That night it was finally quiet. I fell asleep quickly, exhausted.
The rest of the week was uneventful. I got used to the routine of my classes. By Friday I was able to
recognize, if not name, almost all the students at school. In Gym, the kids on my team learned not to pass
me the ball and to step quickly in front of me if the other team tried to take advantage of my weakness. I
happily stayed out of their way.
Edward Cullen didn't come back to school.
Every day, I watched anxiously until the rest of the Cullens entered the cafeteria without him (<font color='blue'><b>Cullen</b></font>). Then I
could relax and join in the lunchtime conversation. Mostly it centered around a trip to the La Push Ocean
Park in two weeks that Mike was putting together. I was invited, and I had agreed to go, more out of
politeness than desire. Beaches should be hot and dry.
By Friday I was perfectly comfortable entering my Biology class, no longer worried that Edward would
be there. For all I knew, he (<font color='blue'><b>Edward</b></font>) had dropped out of school. I tried not to think about him (<font color='blue'><b>Edward</b></font>), but I couldn't
totally suppress the worry that I was responsible for his (<font color='blue'><b>Edward</b></font>) continued absence, ridiculous as it seemed.
My first weekend in Forks passed without incident. Charlie, unused to spending time in the usually empty
house, worked most of the weekend. I cleaned the house, got ahead on my homework, and wrote my
mom more bogusly cheerful e-mail. I did drive to the library Saturday, but it was so poorly stocked that I
didn't bother to get a card; I would have to make a date to visit Olympia or Seattle soon and find a good
bookstore. I wondered idly what kind of gas mileage the truck got and shuddered at the thought.
The rain stayed soft over the weekend, quiet, so I was able to sleep well.
People greeted me in the parking lot Monday morning. I didn't know all their names, but I waved back
and smiled at everyone. It was colder this morning, but happily not raining. In English, Mike took his (<font color='blue'><b>Mike</b></font>)
accustomed seat by my side. We had a pop quiz on Wuthering Heights. It was straightforward, very
easy.
All in all, I was feeling a lot more comfortable than I had thought I would feel by this point. More
comfortable than I had ever expected to feel here.
When we walked out of class, the air was full of swirling bits of white. I could hear people shouting
excitedly to each other. The wind bit at my cheeks, my nose.
<div class="bookquote">``Wow,''  (<font color='red'><b>Mike/Mike Newton/Newton</b></font>)</div>Mike said. <div class="bookquote">``It's snowing.''
 (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div>I looked at the little cotton fluffs that were building up along the sidewalk and swirling erratically past my
face.
<div class="bookquote">``Ew.''  (<font color='red'><b>Snow</b></font>)</div>Snow. There went my good day.
He (<font color='blue'><b>Snow</b></font>) looked surprised. <div class="bookquote">``Don't you like snow?''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``No. That means it's too cold for rain.''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>Obviously. <div class="bookquote">``Besides, I thought it was supposed to come down in
flakes  you know, each one unique and all that. These just look like the ends of Q-tips.''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``Haven't you ever seen snow fall before?''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Snow</b></font>) asked incredulously.
<div class="bookquote">``Sure I have.''  (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div>I paused. <div class="bookquote">``On TV.''
 (<font color='red'><b>Mike/Mike Newton/Newton</b></font>)</div>Mike laughed. And then a big, squishy ball of dripping snow smacked into the back of his (<font color='blue'><b>Mike</b></font>) head. We both

<p/>turned to see where it came from. I had my suspicions about Eric, who was walking away, his (<font color='blue'><b>Eric</b></font>) back
toward us  in the wrong direction for his (<font color='blue'><b>Eric</b></font>) next class. Mike appatently had the same notion. He (<font color='blue'><b>Mike</b></font>) bent
over and began scraping together a pile of the white mush.
<div class="bookquote">``I'll see you at lunch, okay?''  (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div>I kept walking as I spoke. <div class="bookquote">``Once people start throwing wet stuff, I go
inside.''
 (<font color='red'><b>He</b></font>)</div>He (<font color='blue'><b>Mike</b></font>) just nodded, his (<font color='blue'><b>Mike</b></font>) eyes on Eric's retreating figure.
Throughout the morning, everyone chattered excitedly about the snow; apparently it was the first snowfall
of the new year. I kept my mouth shut. Sure, it was drier than rain  until it melted in your socks.
I walked alertly to the cafeteria with Jessica after Spanish. Mush balls were flying everywhere. I kept a
binder in my hands, ready to use it as a shield if necessary. Jessica thought I was hilarious, but something
in my expression kept her (<font color='blue'><b>Jessica</b></font>) from lobbing a snowball at me herself.
Mike caught up to us as we walked in the doors, laughing, with ice melting the spikes in his (<font color='blue'><b>Mike</b></font>) hair. He (<font color='blue'><b>Mike</b></font>) and
Jessica were talking animatedly about the snow fight as we got in line to buy food. I glanced toward that
table in the corner out of habit. And then I froze where I stood. There were five people at the table.
Jessica pulled on my arm.
<div class="bookquote">``Hello? Bella? What do you want?''
 (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div>I looked down; my ears were hot. I had no reason to feel self-conscious, I reminded myself. I hadn't
done anything wrong.
<div class="bookquote">``What's with Bella?''  (<font color='red'><b>Mike/Mike Newton/Newton</b></font>)</div>Mike asked Jessica.
<div class="bookquote">``Nothing,''  (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div>I answered. <div class="bookquote">``I'll just get a soda today.''  (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div>I caught up to the end of the line.
<div class="bookquote">``Aren't you hungry?''  (<font color='red'><b>Jessica</b></font>)</div>Jessica asked.
<div class="bookquote">``Actually, I feel a little sick,''  (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div>I said, my eyes still on the floor.
I waited for them to get their food, and then followed them to a table, my eyes on my feet.
I sipped my soda slowly, my stomach churning. Twice Mike asked, with unnecessary concern, how I
was feeling.
I told him (<font color='blue'><b>Mike</b></font>) it was nothing, but I was wondering if I should play it up and escape to the nurse's office for
the next hour.
Ridiculous. I shouldn't have to run away.
I decided to permit myself one glance at the Cullen family's table. If he (<font color='blue'><b>Cullen</b></font>) was glaring at me, I would skip
Biology, like the coward I was.
I kept my head down and glanced up under my lashes. None of them were looking this way. I lifted my
head a little.
They were laughing. Edward, Jasper, and Emmett all had their hair entirely saturated with melting snow.
Alice and Rosalie were leaning away as Emmett shook his (<font color='blue'><b>Emmett</b></font>) dripping hair toward them. They were
enjoying the snowy day, just like everyone else  only they looked more like a scene from a movie than
the rest of us.

<p/>But, aside from the laughter and playfulness, there was something different, and I couldn't quite pinpoint
what that difference was. I examined Edward the most carefully. His (<font color='blue'><b>Edward</b></font>) skin was less pale, I decided 
flushed from the snow fight maybe  the circles under his (<font color='blue'><b>Edward</b></font>) eyes much less noticeable. But there was
something more. I pondered, staring, trying to isolate the change.
<div class="bookquote">``Bella, what are you staring at?''  (<font color='red'><b>Jessica</b></font>)</div>Jessica intruded, her (<font color='blue'><b>Jessica</b></font>) eyes following my stare.
At that precise moment, his (<font color='blue'><b>Edward</b></font>) eyes flashed over to meet mine.
I dropped my head, letting my hair fall to conceal my face. I was sure, though, in the instant our eyes met,
that he (<font color='blue'><b>Edward</b></font>) didn't look harsh or unfriendly as he (<font color='blue'><b>Edward</b></font>) had the last time I'd seen him (<font color='blue'><b>Edward</b></font>). He (<font color='blue'><b>Edward</b></font>) looked merely curious
again, unsatisfied in some way.
<div class="bookquote">``Edward Cullen is staring at you,''  (<font color='red'><b>Jessica</b></font>)</div>Jessica giggled in my ear.
<div class="bookquote">``He (<font color='blue'><b>Cullen</b></font>) doesn't look angry, does he (<font color='blue'><b>Cullen</b></font>)?''  (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div>I couldn't help asking.
<div class="bookquote">``No,''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Jessica</b></font>) said, sounding confused by my question. <div class="bookquote">``Should he (<font color='blue'><b>Cullen</b></font>) be?''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``I don't think he (<font color='blue'><b>Cullen</b></font>) likes me,''  (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div>I confided. I still felt queasy. I put my head down on my arm.
<div class="bookquote">``The Cullens don't like anybody well, they don't notice anybody enough to like them. But he (<font color='blue'><b>Cullen</b></font>)'s still
staring at you.''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``Stop looking at him (<font color='blue'><b>Cullen</b></font>),''  (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div>I hissed.
She (<font color='blue'><b>Jessica</b></font>) snickered, but she (<font color='blue'><b>Jessica</b></font>) looked away. I raised my head enough to make sure that she (<font color='blue'><b>Jessica</b></font>) did, contemplating
violence if she (<font color='blue'><b>Jessica</b></font>) resisted.
Mike interrupted us then  he (<font color='blue'><b>Mike</b></font>) was planning an epic battle of the blizzard in the parking lot after school
and wanted us to join. Jessica agreed enthusiastically. The way she (<font color='blue'><b>Jessica</b></font>) looked at Mike left little doubt that
she (<font color='blue'><b>Jessica</b></font>) would be up for anything he (<font color='blue'><b>Mike</b></font>) suggested. I kept silent. I would have to hide in the gym until the parking
lot cleared.
For the rest of the lunch hour I very carefully kept my eyes at my own table. I decided to honor the
bargain I'd made with myself. Since he (<font color='blue'><b>Mike</b></font>) didn't look angry, I would go to Biology. My stomach did
frightened little flips at the thought of sitting next to him (<font color='blue'><b>Mike</b></font>) again.
I didn't really want to walk to class with Mike as usual  he (<font color='blue'><b>Mike</b></font>) seemed to be a popular target for the
snowball snipers  but when we went to the door, everyone besides me groaned in unison. It was
raining, washing all traces of the snow away in clear, icy ribbons down the side of the walkway. I pulled
my hood up, secretly pleased. I would be free to go straight home after Gym.
Mike kept up a string of complaints on the way to building four.
Once inside the classroom, I saw with relief that my table was still empty. Mr. Banner was walking
around the room, distributing one microscope and box of slides to each table. Class didn't start for a few
minutes, and the room buzzed with conversation. I kept my eyes away from the door, doodling idly on
the cover of my notebook.
I heard very clearly when the chair next to me moved, but my eyes stayed carefully focused on the
pattern I was drawing.
<div class="bookquote">``Hello,''  (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div>said a quiet, musical voice.

<p/>I looked up, stunned that he (<font color='blue'><b>Banner</b></font>) was speaking to me. He (<font color='blue'><b>Banner</b></font>) was sitting as far away from me as the desk
allowed, but his (<font color='blue'><b>Banner</b></font>) chair was angled toward me. His (<font color='blue'><b>Banner</b></font>) hair was dripping wet, disheveled  even so, he (<font color='blue'><b>Banner</b></font>)
looked like he (<font color='blue'><b>Banner</b></font>)'d just finished shooting a commercial for hair gel. His (<font color='blue'><b>Banner</b></font>) dazzling face was friendly, open, a
slight smile on his (<font color='blue'><b>Banner</b></font>) flawless lips. But his (<font color='blue'><b>Banner</b></font>) eyes were careful.
<div class="bookquote">``My name is Edward Cullen,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Banner</b></font>) continued. <div class="bookquote">``I didn't have a chance to introduce myself last week. You
must be Bella Swan.''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>My mind was spinning with confusion. Had I made up the whole thing? He (<font color='blue'><b>Banner</b></font>) was perfectly polite now. I
had to speak; he (<font color='blue'><b>Banner</b></font>) was waiting. But I couldn't think of anything conventional to say.
<div class="bookquote">``H-how do you know my name?''  (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div>I stammered.
He (<font color='blue'><b>Banner</b></font>) laughed a soft, enchanting laugh.
<div class="bookquote">``Oh, I think everyone knows your name. The whole town's been waiting for you to arrive.''
 (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div>I grimaced. I knew it was something like that.
<div class="bookquote">``No,''  (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div>I persisted stupidly. <div class="bookquote">``I meant, why did you call me Bella?''
 (<font color='red'><b>He</b></font>)</div>He (<font color='blue'><b>Banner</b></font>) seemed confused. <div class="bookquote">``Do you prefer Isabella?''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``No, I like Bella,''  (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div>I said. <div class="bookquote">``But I think Charlie  I mean my dad  must call me Isabella behind my back
 that's what everyone here seems to know me as,''  (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div>I tried to explain, feeling like an utter moron.
<div class="bookquote">``Oh.''  (<font color='red'><b>He</b></font>)</div>He (<font color='blue'><b>moron</b></font>) let it drop. I looked away awkwardly.
Thankfully, Mr. Banner started class at that moment. I tried to concentrate as he (<font color='blue'><b>Banner</b></font>) explained the lab we
would be doing today. The slides in the box were out of order. Working as lab partners, we had to
separate the slides of onion root tip cells into the phases of mitosis they represented and label them
accordingly. We weren't supposed to use our books. In twenty minutes, he (<font color='blue'><b>Banner</b></font>) would be coming around to
see who had it right.
<div class="bookquote">``Get started,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Banner</b></font>) commanded.
<div class="bookquote">``Ladies first, partner?''  (<font color='red'><b>Edward/Edward Cullen/Cullen</b></font>)</div>Edward asked. I looked up to see him (<font color='blue'><b>Edward</b></font>) smiling a crooked smile so beautiful that I
could only stare at him (<font color='blue'><b>Edward</b></font>) like an idiot.
<div class="bookquote">``Or I could start, if you wish.''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>The smile faded; he (<font color='blue'><b>Edward</b></font>) was obviously wondering if I was mentally competent.
<div class="bookquote">``No,''  (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div>I said, flushing. <div class="bookquote">``I'll go ahead.''
 (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div>I was showing off, just a little. I'd already done this lab, and I knew what I was looking for. It should be
easy. I snapped the first slide into place under the microscope and adjusted it quickly to the 40X
objective. I studied the slide briefly.
My assessment was confident. <div class="bookquote">``Prophase.''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``Do you mind if I look?''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Edward</b></font>) asked as I began to remove the slide. His (<font color='blue'><b>Edward</b></font>) hand caught mine, to stop me, as
he (<font color='blue'><b>Edward</b></font>) asked. His (<font color='blue'><b>Edward</b></font>) fingers were ice-cold, like he (<font color='blue'><b>Edward</b></font>)'d been holding them in a snowdrift before class. But that
wasn't why I jerked my hand away so quickly. When he (<font color='blue'><b>Edward</b></font>) touched me, it stung my hand as if an electric
current had passed through us.
<div class="bookquote">``I'm sorry,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Edward</b></font>) muttered, pulling his (<font color='blue'><b>Edward</b></font>) hand back immediately. However, he (<font color='blue'><b>Edward</b></font>) continued to reach for the

<p/>microscope. I watched him (<font color='blue'><b>Edward</b></font>), still staggered, as he (<font color='blue'><b>Edward</b></font>) examined the slide for an even shorter time than I had.
<div class="bookquote">``Prophase,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Edward</b></font>) agreed, writing it neatly in the first space on our worksheet. He (<font color='blue'><b>Edward</b></font>) swiftly switched out the
first slide for the second, and then glanced at it cursorily.
<div class="bookquote">``Anaphase,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Edward</b></font>) murmured, writing it down as he (<font color='blue'><b>Edward</b></font>) spoke.
I kept my voice indifferent. <div class="bookquote">``May I?''
 (<font color='red'><b>He</b></font>)</div>He (<font color='blue'><b>Edward</b></font>) smirked and pushed the microscope to me.
I looked through the eyepiece eagerly, only to be disappointed. Dang it, he (<font color='blue'><b>Dang</b></font>) was right.
<div class="bookquote">``Slide three?''  (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div>I held out my hand without looking at him (<font color='blue'><b>Dang</b></font>).
He (<font color='blue'><b>Dang</b></font>) handed it to me; it seemed like he (<font color='blue'><b>Dang</b></font>) was being careful not to touch my skin again.
I took the most fleeting look I could manage.
<div class="bookquote">``Interphase.''  (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div>I passed him (<font color='blue'><b>Dang</b></font>) the microscope before he (<font color='blue'><b>Dang</b></font>) could ask for it. He (<font color='blue'><b>Dang</b></font>) took a swift peek, and then
wrote it down. I would have written it while he (<font color='blue'><b>Dang</b></font>) looked, but his (<font color='blue'><b>Dang</b></font>) clear, elegant script intimidated me. I
didn't want to spoil the page with my clumsy scrawl.
We were finished before anyone else was close. I could see Mike and his (<font color='blue'><b>Mike</b></font>) partner comparing two slides
again and again, and another group had their book open under the table.
Which left me with nothing to do but try to not look at him (<font color='blue'><b>Mike</b></font>) unsuccessfully. I glanced up, and he (<font color='blue'><b>Mike</b></font>) was
staring at me, that same inexplicable look of frustration in his (<font color='blue'><b>Mike</b></font>) eyes. Suddenly I identified that subtle
difference in his (<font color='blue'><b>Mike</b></font>) face.
<div class="bookquote">``Did you get contacts?''  (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div>I blurted out unthinkingly.
He (<font color='blue'><b>Mike</b></font>) seemed puzzled by my unexpected question. <div class="bookquote">``No.''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``Oh,''  (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div>I mumbled. <div class="bookquote">``I thought there was something different about your eyes.''
 (<font color='red'><b>He</b></font>)</div>He (<font color='blue'><b>Mike</b></font>) shrugged, and looked away.
In fact, I was sure there was something different. I vividly remembered the flat black color of his (<font color='blue'><b>Mike</b></font>) eyes the
last time he (<font color='blue'><b>Mike</b></font>)'d glared at me  the color was striking against the background of his (<font color='blue'><b>Mike</b></font>) pale skin and his (<font color='blue'><b>Mike</b></font>)
auburn hair. Today, his (<font color='blue'><b>Mike</b></font>) eyes were a completely different color: a strange ocher, darker than butterscotch,
but with the same golden tone. I didn't understand how that could be, unless he (<font color='blue'><b>Mike</b></font>) was lying for some
reason about the contacts. Or maybe Forks was making me crazy in the literal sense of the word.
I looked down. His (<font color='blue'><b>Mike</b></font>) hands were clenched into hard fists again.
Mr. Banner came to our table then, to see why we weren't working. He (<font color='blue'><b>Banner</b></font>) looked over our shoulders to
glance at the completed lab, and then stared more intently to check the answers.
<div class="bookquote">``So, Edward, didn't you think Isabella should get a chance with the microscope?''  (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Banner</b></font>)</div>Mr. Banner asked.
<div class="bookquote">``Bella,''  (<font color='red'><b>Edward/Edward Cullen/Cullen</b></font>)</div>Edward corrected automatically. <div class="bookquote">``Actually, she (<font color='blue'><b>Bella</b></font>) identified three of the five.''
 (<font color='red'><b>Mr.</b></font>)</div>Mr. Banner looked at me now; his (<font color='blue'><b>Edward</b></font>) expression was skeptical.
<div class="bookquote">``Have you done this lab before?''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Edward</b></font>) asked.

<p/>I smiled sheepishly. <div class="bookquote">``Not with onion root.''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``Whitefish blastula?''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``Yeah.''
 (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Banner</b></font>)</div>Mr. Banner nodded. <div class="bookquote">``Were you in an advanced placement program in Phoenix?''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``Yes.''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``Well,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Banner</b></font>) said after a moment, <div class="bookquote">``I guess it's good you two are lab partners.''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>He (<font color='blue'><b>Banner</b></font>) mumbled something else
as he (<font color='blue'><b>Banner</b></font>) walked away. After he (<font color='blue'><b>Banner</b></font>) left, I began doodling on my notebook again.
<div class="bookquote">``It's too bad about the snow, isn't it?''  (<font color='red'><b>Edward/Edward Cullen/Cullen</b></font>)</div>Edward asked. I had the feeling that he (<font color='blue'><b>Edward</b></font>) was forcing himself to
make small talk with me. Paranoia swept over me again. It was like he (<font color='blue'><b>Edward</b></font>) had heard my conversation with
Jessica at lunch and was trying to prove me wrong.
<div class="bookquote">``Not really,''  (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div>I answered honestly, instead of pretending to be normal like everyone else. I was still trying
to dislodge the stupid feeling of suspicion, and I couldn't concentrate.
<div class="bookquote">``You don't like the cold.''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>It wasn't a question.
<div class="bookquote">``Or the wet.''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``Forks must be a difficult place for you to live,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Edward</b></font>) mused.
<div class="bookquote">``You have no idea,''  (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div>I muttered darkly.
He (<font color='blue'><b>Edward</b></font>) looked fascinated by what I said, for some reason I couldn't imagine. His (<font color='blue'><b>Edward</b></font>) face was such a distraction
that I tried not to look at it any more than courtesy absolutely demanded.
<div class="bookquote">``Why did you come here, then?''
 (<font color='red'><b>me</b></font>)</div>No one had asked me that  not straight out like he (<font color='blue'><b>Edward</b></font>) did, demanding.
<div class="bookquote">``It's complicated.''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``I think I can keep up,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Edward</b></font>) pressed.
I paused for a long moment, and then made the mistake of meeting his (<font color='blue'><b>Edward</b></font>) gaze. His (<font color='blue'><b>Edward</b></font>) dark gold eyes confused
me, and I answered without thinking.
<div class="bookquote">``My mother got remarried,''  (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div>I said.
<div class="bookquote">``That doesn't sound so complex,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Edward</b></font>) disagreed, but he (<font color='blue'><b>Edward</b></font>) was suddenly sympathetic. <div class="bookquote">``When did that
happen?''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``Last September.''  (<font color='red'><b>me</b></font>)</div>My voice sounded sad, even to me.
<div class="bookquote">``And you don't like him (<font color='blue'><b>I</b></font>),''  (<font color='red'><b>Edward/Edward Cullen/Cullen</b></font>)</div>Edward surmised, his (<font color='blue'><b>Edward</b></font>) tone still kind.
<div class="bookquote">``No, Phil is fine. Too young, maybe, but nice enough.''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``Why didn't you stay with them?''
 (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div>I couldn't fathom his (<font color='blue'><b>Edward</b></font>) interest, but he (<font color='blue'><b>Edward</b></font>) continued to stare at me with penetrating eyes, as if my dull life's

<p/>story was somehow vitally important.
<div class="bookquote">``Phil travels a lot. He (<font color='blue'><b>Phil</b></font>) plays ball for a living.''  (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div>I half-smiled.
<div class="bookquote">``Have I heard of him (<font color='blue'><b>Phil</b></font>)?''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Edward</b></font>) asked, smiling in response.
<div class="bookquote">``Probably not. He (<font color='blue'><b>Phil</b></font>) doesn't play well. Strictly minor league. He (<font color='blue'><b>Phil</b></font>) moves around a lot.''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``And your mother sent you here so that she (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) could travel with him (<font color='blue'><b>Phil</b></font>).''  (<font color='red'><b>He</b></font>)</div>He (<font color='blue'><b>Edward</b></font>) said it as an assumption again, not
a question.
My chin raised a fraction. <div class="bookquote">``No, she (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) did not send me here. I sent myself.''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>His (<font color='blue'><b>Edward</b></font>) eyebrows knit together. <div class="bookquote">``I don't understand,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Edward</b></font>) admitted, and he (<font color='blue'><b>Edward</b></font>) seemed unnecessarily frustrated by
that fact.
I sighed. Why was I explaining this to him (<font color='blue'><b>Edward</b></font>)? He (<font color='blue'><b>Edward</b></font>) continued to stare at me with obvious curiosity.
<div class="bookquote">``She (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) stayed with me at first, but she (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) missed him (<font color='blue'><b>Phil</b></font>). It made her (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) unhappy so I decided it was time to
spend some quality time with Charlie.''  (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div>My voice was glum by the time I finished.
<div class="bookquote">``But now you're unhappy,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Edward</b></font>) pointed out.
<div class="bookquote">``And?''  (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div>I challenged.
<div class="bookquote">``That doesn't seem fair.''  (<font color='red'><b>He</b></font>)</div>He (<font color='blue'><b>Edward</b></font>) shrugged, but his (<font color='blue'><b>Edward</b></font>) eyes were still intense.
I laughed without humor. <div class="bookquote">``Hasn't anyone ever told you? Life isn't fair.''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``I believe I have heard that somewhere before,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Edward</b></font>) agreed dryly.
<div class="bookquote">``So that's all,''  (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div>I insisted, wondering why he (<font color='blue'><b>Edward</b></font>) was still staring at me that way.
His (<font color='blue'><b>Edward</b></font>) gaze became appraising. <div class="bookquote">``You put on a good show,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Edward</b></font>) said slowly. <div class="bookquote">``But I'd be willing to bet that
you're suffering more than you let anyone see.''
 (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div>I grimaced at him (<font color='blue'><b>Edward</b></font>), resisting the impulse to stick out my tongue like a five-year-old, and looked away.
<div class="bookquote">``Am I wrong?''
 (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div>I tried to ignore him (<font color='blue'><b>Edward</b></font>).
<div class="bookquote">``I didn't think so,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Edward</b></font>) murmured smugly.
<div class="bookquote">``Why does it matter to you?''  (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div>I asked, irritated. I kept my eyes away, watching the teacher make his (<font color='blue'><b>Edward</b></font>)
rounds.
<div class="bookquote">``That's a very good question,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Edward</b></font>) muttered, so quietly that I wondered if he (<font color='blue'><b>Edward</b></font>) was talking to himself.
However, after a few seconds of silence, I decided that was the only answer I was going to get.
I sighed, scowling at the blackboard.
<div class="bookquote">``Am I annoying you?''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Edward</b></font>) asked. He (<font color='blue'><b>Edward</b></font>) sounded amused.
I glanced at him (<font color='blue'><b>Edward</b></font>) without thinking and told the truth again. <div class="bookquote">``Not exactly. I'm more annoyed at myself.
My face is so easy to read  my mother always calls me her (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) open book.''  (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div>I frowned.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``On the contrary, I find you very difficult to read.''  (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div>Despite everything that I'd said and he (<font color='blue'><b>Edward</b></font>)'d guessed, he (<font color='blue'><b>Edward</b></font>)
sounded like he (<font color='blue'><b>Edward</b></font>) meant it.
<div class="bookquote">``You must be a good reader then,''  (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div>I replied.
<div class="bookquote">``Usually.''  (<font color='red'><b>He</b></font>)</div>He (<font color='blue'><b>Edward</b></font>) smiled widely, flashing a set of perfect, ultrawhite teeth.
Mr. Banner called the class to order then, and I turned with relief to listen. I was in disbelief that I'd just
explained my dreary life to this bizarre, beautiful boy who may or may not despise me. He (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>)'d seemed
engrossed in our conversation, but now I could see, from the corner of my eye, that he (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>) was leaning away
from me again, his (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>) hands gripping the edge of the table with unmistakable tension.
I tried to appear attentive as Mr. Banner illustrated, with transparencies on the overhead projector, what
I had seen without difficulty through the microscope. But my thoughts were unmanageable.
When the bell finally rang, Edward rushed as swiftly and as gracefully from the room as he (<font color='blue'><b>Edward</b></font>) had last
Monday. And, like last Monday, I stared after him (<font color='blue'><b>Edward</b></font>) in amazement.
Mike skipped quickly to my side and picked up my books for me. I imagined him (<font color='blue'><b>Mike</b></font>) with a wagging tail.
<div class="bookquote">``That was awful,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Mike</b></font>) groaned. <div class="bookquote">``They all looked exactly the same. You're lucky you had Cullen for a
partner.''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``I didn't have any trouble with it,''  (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div>I said, stung by his (<font color='blue'><b>Mike</b></font>) assumption. I regretted the snub instantly. <div class="bookquote">``I've done
the lab before, though,''  (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div>I added before he (<font color='blue'><b>Mike</b></font>) could get his (<font color='blue'><b>Mike</b></font>) feelings hurt.
<div class="bookquote">``Cullen seemed friendly enough today,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Mike</b></font>) commented as we shrugged into our raincoats. He (<font color='blue'><b>Mike</b></font>) didn't seem
pleased about it.
I tried to sound indifferent. <div class="bookquote">``I wonder what was with him (<font color='blue'><b>Cullen</b></font>) last Monday.''
 (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div>I couldn't concentrate on Mike's chatter as we walked to Gym, and RE. didn't do much to hold my
attention, either. Mike was on my team today. He (<font color='blue'><b>Mike</b></font>) chivalrously covered my position as well as his (<font color='blue'><b>Mike</b></font>) own,
so my woolgathering was only interrupted when it was my turn to serve; my team ducked warily out of
the way every time I was up.
The rain was just a mist as I walked to the parking lot, but I was happier when I was in the dry cab. I got
the heater running, for once not caring about the mind-numbing roar of the engine. I unzipped my jacket,
put the hood down, and fluffed my damp hair out so the heater could dry it on the way home.
I looked around me to make sure it was clear. That's when I noticed the still, white figure. Edward Cullen
was leaning against the front door of the Volvo, three cars down from me, and staring intently in my
direction. I swiftly looked away and threw the truck into reverse, almost hitting a rusty Toyota Corolla in
my haste. Lucky for the Toyota, I stomped on the brake in time. It was just the sort of car that my truck
would make scrap metal of. I took a deep breath, still looking out the other side of my car, and
cautiously pulled out again, with greater success. I stared straight ahead as I passed the Volvo, but from
a peripheral peek, I would swear I saw him (<font color='blue'><b>I</b></font>) laughing.

<p/>3. PHENOMENON

<p/>When I opened my eyes in the morning, something was different.

<p/>It was the light. It was still the gray-green light of a cloudy day in the forest, but it was clearer somehow. I
realized there was no fog veiling my window.
I jumped up to look outside, and then groaned in horror.
A fine layer of snow covered the yard, dusted the top of my truck, and whitened the road. But that
wasn't the worst part. All the rain from yesterday had frozen solid  coating the needles on the trees in
fantastic, gorgeous patterns, and making the driveway a deadly ice slick. I had enough trouble not falling
down when the ground was dry; it might be safer for me to go back to bed now.
Charlie had left for work before I got downstairs. In a lot of ways, living with Charlie was like having my
own place, and I found myself reveling in the aloneness instead of being lonely.
I threw down a quick bowl of cereal and some orange juice from the carton. I felt excited to go to
school, and that scared me. I knew it wasn't the stimulating learning environment I was anticipating, or
seeing my new set of friends. If I was being honest with myself, I knew I was eager to get to school
because I would see Edward Cullen. And that was very, very stupid.
I should be avoiding him (<font color='blue'><b>Cullen</b></font>) entirely after my brainless and embarrassing babbling yesterday. And I was
suspicious of him (<font color='blue'><b>Cullen</b></font>); why should he (<font color='blue'><b>Cullen</b></font>) lie about his (<font color='blue'><b>Cullen</b></font>) eyes? I was still frightened of the hostility I sometimes felt
emanating from him (<font color='blue'><b>Cullen</b></font>), and I was still tongue-tied whenever I pictured his (<font color='blue'><b>Cullen</b></font>) perfect face. I was well aware
that my league and his (<font color='blue'><b>Cullen</b></font>) league were spheres that did not touch. So I shouldn't be at all anxious to see him (<font color='blue'><b>Cullen</b></font>)
today.
It took every ounce of my concentration to make it down the icy brick driveway alive. I almost lost my
balance when I finally got to the truck, but I managed to cling to the side mirror and save myself. Clearly,
today was going to be nightmarish.
Driving to school, I distracted myself from my fear of falling and my unwanted speculations about
Edward Cullen by thinking about Mike and Eric, and the obvious difference in how teenage boys
responded to me here. I was sure I looked exactly the same as I had in Phoenix. Maybe it was just that
the boys back home had watched me pass slowly through all the awkward phases of adolescence and
still thought of me that way. Perhaps it was because I was a novelty here, where novelties were few and
far between. Possibly my crippling clumsiness was seen as endearing rather than pathetic, casting me as a
damsel in distress. Whatever the reason, Mike's puppy dog behavior and Eric's apparent rivalry with him (<font color='blue'><b>Eric</b></font>)
were disconcerting. I wasn't sure if I didn't prefer being ignored.
My truck seemed to have no problem with the black ice that covered the roads. I drove very slowly,
though, not wanting to carve a path of destruction through Main Street.
When I got out of my truck at school, I saw why I'd had so little trouble. Something silver caught my eye,
and I walked to the back of the truck  carefully holding the side for support  to examine my tires.
There were thin chains crisscrossed in diamond shapes around them. Charlie had gotten up who knows
how early to put snow chains on my truck. My throat suddenly felt tight. I wasn't used to being taken
care of, and Charlie's unspoken concern caught me by surprise.
I was standing by the back corner of the truck, struggling to fight back the sudden wave of emotion the
snow chains had brought on, when I heard an odd sound.
It was a high-pitched screech, and it was fast becoming painfully loud. I looked up, startled.
I saw several things simultaneously. Nothing was moving in slow motion, the way it does in the movies.
Instead, the adrenaline rush seemed to make my brain work much faster, and I was able to absorb in

<p/>clear detail several things at once.
Edward Cullen was standing four cars down from me, staring at me in horror. His (<font color='blue'><b>Cullen</b></font>) face stood out from a
sea of faces, all frozen in the same mask of shock. But of more immediate importance was the dark blue
van that was skidding, tires locked and squealing against the brakes, spinning wildly across the ice of the
parking lot. It was going to hit the back corner of my truck, and I was standing between them. I didn't
even have time to close my eyes.
Just before I heard the shattering crunch of the van folding around the truck bed, something hit me, hard,
but not from the direction I was expecting. My head cracked against the icy blacktop, and I felt
something solid and cold pinning me to the ground. I was lying on the pavement behind the tan car I'd
parked next to. But I didn't have a chance to notice anything else, because the van was still coming. It
had curled gratingly around the end of the truck and, still spinning and sliding, was about to collide with
me again.
A low oath made me aware that someone was with me, and the voice was impossible not to recognize.
Two long, white hands shot out protectively in front of me, and the van shuddered to a stop a foot from
my face, the large hands fitting providentially into a deep dent in the side of the van's body.
Then his (<font color='blue'><b>dent</b></font>) hands moved so fast they blurred. One was suddenly gripping under the body of the van, and
something was dragging me, swinging my legs around like a rag doll's, till they hit the tire of the tan car. A
groaning metallic thud hurt my ears, and the van settled, glass popping, onto the asphalt  exactly
where, a second ago, my legs had been.
It was absolutely silent for one long second before the screaming began. In the abrupt bedlam, I could
hear more than one person shouting my name. But more clearly than all the yelling, I could hear Edward
Cullen's low, frantic voice in my ear.
<div class="bookquote">``Bella? Are you all right?''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``I'm fine.''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>My voice sounded strange. I tried to sit up, and realized he (<font color='blue'><b>Cullen</b></font>) was holding me against the side of
his (<font color='blue'><b>Cullen</b></font>) body in an iron grasp.
<div class="bookquote">``Be careful,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Cullen</b></font>) warned as I struggled. <div class="bookquote">``I think you hit your head pretty hard.''
 (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div>I became aware of a throbbing ache centered above my left ear.
<div class="bookquote">``Ow,''  (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div>I said, surprised.
<div class="bookquote">``That's what I thought.''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>His (<font color='blue'><b>Cullen</b></font>) voice, amazingly, sounded like he (<font color='blue'><b>Cullen</b></font>) was suppressing laughter.
<div class="bookquote">``How in the''  (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div>I trailed off, trying to clear my head, get my bearings. <div class="bookquote">``How did you get over here so
fast?''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``I was standing right next to you, Bella,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Cullen</b></font>) said, his (<font color='blue'><b>Cullen</b></font>) tone serious again.
I turned to sit up, and this time he (<font color='blue'><b>Cullen</b></font>) let me, releasing his (<font color='blue'><b>Cullen</b></font>) hold around my waist and sliding as far from me as
he (<font color='blue'><b>Cullen</b></font>) could in the limited space. I looked at his (<font color='blue'><b>Cullen</b></font>) concerned, innocent expression and was disoriented again
by the force of his (<font color='blue'><b>Cullen</b></font>) gold-colored eyes. What was I asking him (<font color='blue'><b>Cullen</b></font>)?
And then they found us, a crowd of people with tears streaming down their faces, shouting at each other,
shouting at us.
<div class="bookquote">``Don't move,''  (<font color='red'><b>someone</b></font>)</div>someone instructed.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Get Tyler out of the van!''  (<font color='red'><b>someone</b></font>)</div>someone else shouted.
There was a flurry of activity around us. I tried to get up, but Edward's cold hand pushed my shoulder
down.
<div class="bookquote">``Just stay put for now.''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``But it's cold,''  (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div>I complained. It surprised me when he (<font color='blue'><b>Edward</b></font>) chuckled under his (<font color='blue'><b>Edward</b></font>) breath. There was an edge to
the sound.
<div class="bookquote">``You were over there,''  (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div>I suddenly remembered, and his (<font color='blue'><b>Edward</b></font>) chuckle stopped short. <div class="bookquote">``You were by your car.''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>His (<font color='blue'><b>Edward</b></font>) expression turned hard. <div class="bookquote">``No, I wasn't.''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``I saw you.''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>All around us was chaos. I could hear the gruffer voices of adults arriving on the scene. But I
obstinately held on to our argument; I was right, and he (<font color='blue'><b>Edward</b></font>) was going to admit it.
<div class="bookquote">``Bella, I was standing with you, and I pulled you out of the way.''  (<font color='red'><b>He</b></font>)</div>He (<font color='blue'><b>Edward</b></font>) unleashed the full, devastating
power of his (<font color='blue'><b>Edward</b></font>) eyes on me, as if trying to communicate something crucial.
<div class="bookquote">``No.''  (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div>I set my jaw.
The gold in his (<font color='blue'><b>Edward</b></font>) eyes blazed. <div class="bookquote">``Please, Bella.''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``Why?''  (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div>I demanded.
<div class="bookquote">``Trust me,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Edward</b></font>) pleaded, his (<font color='blue'><b>Edward</b></font>) soft voice overwhelming.
I could hear the sirens now. <div class="bookquote">``Will you promise to explain everything to me later?''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``Fine,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Edward</b></font>) snapped, abruptly exasperated.
<div class="bookquote">``Fine,''  (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div>I repeated angrily.
It took six EMTs and two teachers  Mr. Varner and Coach Clapp  to shift the van far enough away
from us to bring the stretchers in. Edward vehemently refused his (<font color='blue'><b>Edward</b></font>), and I tried to do the same, but the
traitor told them I'd hit my head and probably had a concussion. I almost died of humiliation when they
put on the neck brace. It looked like the entire school was there, watching soberly as they loaded me in
the back of the ambulance. Edward got to ride in the front. It was maddening.
To make matters worse, Chief Swan arrived before they could get me safely away.
<div class="bookquote">``Bella!''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Chief</b></font>) yelled in panic when he (<font color='blue'><b>Chief</b></font>) recognized me on the stretcher.
<div class="bookquote">``I'm completely fine, Char  Dad,''  (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div>I sighed. <div class="bookquote">``There's nothing wrong with me.''
 (<font color='red'><b>He</b></font>)</div>He (<font color='blue'><b>Chief</b></font>) turned to the closest EMT for a second opinion. I tuned him (<font color='blue'><b>Chief</b></font>) out to consider the jumble of inexplicable
images churning chaotically in my head. When they'd lifted me away from the car, I had seen the deep
dent in the tan car's bumper  a very distinct dent that fit the contours of Edward's shoulders as if he (<font color='blue'><b>Edward</b></font>)
had braced himself against the car with enough force to damage the metal frame
And then there was his (<font color='blue'><b>Edward</b></font>) family, looking on from the distance, with expressions that ranged from
disapproval to fury but held no hint of concern for their brother's safety.
I tried to think of a logical solution that could explain what I had just seen  a solution that excluded the

<p/>assumption that I was insane.
Naturally, the ambulance got a police escort to the county hospital. I felt ridiculous the whole time they
were unloading me. What made it worse was that Edward simply glided through the hospital doors under
his (<font color='blue'><b>Edward</b></font>) own power. I ground my teeth together.
They put me in the emergency room, a long room with a line of beds separated by pastel-patterned
curtains. A nurse put a pressure cuff on my arm and a thermometer under my tongue. Since no one
bothered pulling the curtain around to give me some privacy, I decided I wasn't obligated to wear the
stupid-looking neck brace anymore. When the nurse walked away, I quickly unfastened the Velcro and
threw it under the bed.
There was another flurry of hospital personnel, another stretcher brought to the bed next to me. I
recognized Tyler Crowley from my Government class beneath the bloodstained bandages wrapped
tightly around his (<font color='blue'><b>Crowley</b></font>) head. Tyler looked a hundred times worse than I felt. But he (<font color='blue'><b>Tyler</b></font>) was staring anxiously at
me.
<div class="bookquote">``Bella, I'm so sorry!''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``I'm fine, Tyler  you look awful, are you all right?''  (<font color='red'><b>nurses</b></font>)</div>As we spoke, nurses began unwinding his (<font color='blue'><b>Tyler</b></font>) soiled
bandages, exposing a myriad of shallow slices all over his (<font color='blue'><b>Tyler</b></font>) forehead and left cheek.
He (<font color='blue'><b>Tyler</b></font>) ignored me. <div class="bookquote">``I thought I was going to kill you! I was going too fast, and I hit the ice wrong''  (<font color='red'><b>He</b></font>)</div>He (<font color='blue'><b>Tyler</b></font>)
winced as one nurse started dabbing at his (<font color='blue'><b>Tyler</b></font>) face.
<div class="bookquote">``Don't worry about it; you missed me.''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``How did you get out of the way so fast? You were there, and then you were gone''
 (<font color='red'><b>He</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``Umm Edward pulled me out of the way.''
 (<font color='red'><b>He</b></font>)</div>He (<font color='blue'><b>Tyler</b></font>) looked confused. <div class="bookquote">``Who?''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``Edward Cullen  he (<font color='blue'><b>Cullen</b></font>) was standing next to me.''  (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div>I'd always been a terrible liar; I didn't sound convincing
at all.
<div class="bookquote">``Cullen? I didn't see him (<font color='blue'><b>Cullen</b></font>) wow, it was all so fast, I guess. Is he (<font color='blue'><b>Cullen</b></font>) okay?''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``I think so. He (<font color='blue'><b>Cullen</b></font>)'s here somewhere, but they didn't make him (<font color='blue'><b>Cullen</b></font>) use a stretcher.''
 (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div>I knew I wasn't crazy. What had happened? There was no way to explain away what I'd seen.
They wheeled me away then, to X-ray my head. I told them there was nothing wrong, and I was right.
Not even a concussion. I asked if I could leave, but the nurse said I had to talk to a doctor first. So I was
trapped in the ER, waiting, harassed by Tyler's constant apologies and promises to make it up to me. No
matter how many times I tried to convince him (<font color='blue'><b>Tyler</b></font>) I was fine, he (<font color='blue'><b>Tyler</b></font>) continued to torment himself. Finally, I
closed my eyes and ignored him (<font color='blue'><b>Tyler</b></font>). He (<font color='blue'><b>Tyler</b></font>) kept up a remorseful mumbling.
<div class="bookquote">``Is she (<font color='blue'><b>me</b></font>) sleeping?''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>a musical voice asked. My eyes flew open.
Edward was standing at the foot of my bed, smirking. I glared at him (<font color='blue'><b>Edward</b></font>). It wasn't easy  it would have
been more natural to ogle.
<div class="bookquote">``Hey, Edward, I'm really sorry ''  (<font color='red'><b>Tyler/Tyler Crowley</b></font>)</div>Tyler began.

<p/>Edward lifted a hand to stop him (<font color='blue'><b>Edward</b></font>).
<div class="bookquote">``No blood, no foul,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Edward</b></font>) said, flashing his (<font color='blue'><b>Edward</b></font>) brilliant teeth. He (<font color='blue'><b>Edward</b></font>) moved to sit on the edge of Tyler's bed, facing
me. He (<font color='blue'><b>Tyler</b></font>) smirked again.
<div class="bookquote">``So, what's the verdict?''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Tyler</b></font>) asked me.
<div class="bookquote">``There's nothing wrong with me at all, but they won't let me go,''  (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div>I complained. <div class="bookquote">``How come you aren't
strapped to a gurney like the rest of us?''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``It's all about who you know,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Tyler</b></font>) answered. <div class="bookquote">``But don't worry, I came to spring you.''
 (<font color='red'><b>a doctor</b></font>)</div>Then a doctor walked around the corner, and my mouth fell open. He (<font color='blue'><b>Tyler</b></font>) was young, he (<font color='blue'><b>Tyler</b></font>) was blond and
he (<font color='blue'><b>Tyler</b></font>) was handsomer than any movie star I'd ever seen. He (<font color='blue'><b>Tyler</b></font>) was pale, though, and tired-looking, with circles
under his (<font color='blue'><b>Tyler</b></font>) eyes. From Charlie's description, this had to be Edward's father.
<div class="bookquote">``So, Miss Swan,''  (<font color='red'><b>Dr. Cullen</b></font>)</div>Dr. Cullen said in a remarkably appealing voice, <div class="bookquote">``how are you feeling?''
 (<font color='red'><b>Dr. Cullen</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``I'm fine,''  (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div>I said, for the last time, I hoped.
He (<font color='blue'><b>Cullen</b></font>) walked to the lightboard on the wall over my head, and turned it on.
<div class="bookquote">``Your X-rays look good,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Cullen</b></font>) said. <div class="bookquote">``Does your head hurt? Edward said you hit it pretty hard.''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``It's fine,''  (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div>I repeated with a sigh, throwing a quick scowl toward Edward.
The doctor's cool fingers probed lightly along my skull. He (<font color='blue'><b>Edward</b></font>) noticed when I winced.
<div class="bookquote">``Tender?''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Edward</b></font>) asked.
<div class="bookquote">``Not really.''  (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div>I'd had worse.
I heard a chuckle, and looked over to see Edward's patronizing smile. My eyes narrowed.
<div class="bookquote">``Well, your father is in the waiting room  you can go home with him (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) now. But come back if you feel
dizzy or have trouble with your eyesight at all.''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``Can't I go back to school?''  (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div>I asked, imagining Charlie trying to be attentive.
<div class="bookquote">``Maybe you should take it easy today.''
 (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div>I glanced at Edward. <div class="bookquote">``Does he (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) get to go to school?''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``Someone has to spread the good news that we survived,''  (<font color='red'><b>Edward/Edward Cullen/Cullen</b></font>)</div>Edward said smugly.
<div class="bookquote">``Actually,''  (<font color='red'><b>Dr. Cullen</b></font>)</div>Dr. Cullen corrected, <div class="bookquote">``most of the school seems to be in the waiting room.''
 (<font color='red'><b>Dr. Cullen</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``Oh no,''  (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div>I moaned, covering my face with my hands.
Dr. Cullen raised his (<font color='blue'><b>Cullen</b></font>) eyebrows. <div class="bookquote">``Do you want to stay?''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``No, no!''  (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div>I insisted, throwing my legs over the side of the bed and hopping down quickly. Too quickly
 I staggered, and Dr. Cullen caught me. He (<font color='blue'><b>Cullen</b></font>) looked concerned.
<div class="bookquote">``I'm fine,''  (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div>I assured him (<font color='blue'><b>Cullen</b></font>) again. No need to tell him (<font color='blue'><b>Cullen</b></font>) my balance problems had nothing to do with hitting my
head.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Take some Tylenol for the pain,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Cullen</b></font>) suggested as he (<font color='blue'><b>Cullen</b></font>) steadied me.
<div class="bookquote">``It doesn't hurt that bad,''  (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div>I insisted.
<div class="bookquote">``It sounds like you were extremely lucky,''  (<font color='red'><b>Dr. Cullen</b></font>)</div>Dr. Cullen said, smiling as he (<font color='blue'><b>Cullen</b></font>) signed my chart with a flourish.
<div class="bookquote">``Lucky Edward happened to be standing next to me,''  (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div>I amended with a hard glance at the subject of my
statement.
<div class="bookquote">``Oh, well, yes,''  (<font color='red'><b>Dr. Cullen</b></font>)</div>Dr. Cullen agreed, suddenly occupied with the papers in front of him (<font color='blue'><b>Cullen</b></font>). Then he (<font color='blue'><b>Cullen</b></font>) looked
away, at Tyler, and walked to the next bed. My intuition flickered; the doctor was in on it.
<div class="bookquote">``I'm afraid that you'll have to stay with us just a little bit longer,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>doctor</b></font>) said to Tyler, and began checking his (<font color='blue'><b>doctor</b></font>)
cuts.
As soon as the doctor's back was turned, I moved to Edward's side.
<div class="bookquote">``Can I talk to you for a minute?''  (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div>I hissed under my breath. He (<font color='blue'><b>Edward</b></font>) took a step back from me, his (<font color='blue'><b>Edward</b></font>) jaw
suddenly clenched.
<div class="bookquote">``Your father is waiting for you,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Edward</b></font>) said through his (<font color='blue'><b>Edward</b></font>) teeth.
I glanced at Dr. Cullen and Tyler.
<div class="bookquote">``I'd like to speak with you alone, if you don't mind,''  (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div>I pressed.
He (<font color='blue'><b>Cullen</b></font>) glared, and then turned his (<font color='blue'><b>Cullen</b></font>) back and strode down the long room. I nearly had to run to keep up. As
soon as we turned the corner into a short hallway, he (<font color='blue'><b>Cullen</b></font>) spun around to face me.
<div class="bookquote">``What do you want?''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Cullen</b></font>) asked, sounding annoyed. His (<font color='blue'><b>Cullen</b></font>) eyes were cold.
His (<font color='blue'><b>Cullen</b></font>) unfriendliness intimidated me. My words came out with less severity than I'd intended. <div class="bookquote">``You owe me
an explanation,''  (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div>I reminded him (<font color='blue'><b>Cullen</b></font>).
<div class="bookquote">``I saved your life  I don't owe you anything.''
 (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div>I flinched back from the resentment in his (<font color='blue'><b>Cullen</b></font>) voice. <div class="bookquote">``You promised.''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``Bella, you hit your head, you don't know what you're talking about.''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>His (<font color='blue'><b>Cullen</b></font>) tone was cutting.
My temper flared now, and I glared defiantly at him (<font color='blue'><b>Cullen</b></font>). <div class="bookquote">``There's nothing wrong with my head.''
 (<font color='red'><b>He</b></font>)</div>He (<font color='blue'><b>Cullen</b></font>) glared back. <div class="bookquote">``What do you want from me, Bella?''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``I want to know the truth,''  (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div>I said. <div class="bookquote">``I want to know why I'm lying for you.''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``What do you think happened?''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Cullen</b></font>) snapped.
It came out in a rush.
<div class="bookquote">``All I know is that you weren't anywhere near me  Tyler didn't see you, either, so don't tell me I hit my
head too hard. That van was going to crush us both  and it didn't, and your hands left dents in the side
of it  and you left a dent in the other car, and you're not hurt at all  and the van should have smashed
my legs, but you were holding it up''  (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div>I could hear how crazy it sounded, and I couldn't continue. I was
so mad I could feel the tears coming; I tried to force them back by grinding my teeth together.

<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Cullen</b></font>) was staring at me incredulously. But his (<font color='blue'><b>Cullen</b></font>) face was tense, defensive.
<div class="bookquote">``You think I lifted a van off you?''  (<font color='red'><b>me</b></font>)</div>His (<font color='blue'><b>Cullen</b></font>) tone questioned my sanity, but it only made me more suspicious. It
was like a perfectly delivered line by a skilled actor.
I merely nodded once, jaw tight.
<div class="bookquote">``Nobody will believe that, you know.''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>His (<font color='blue'><b>actor</b></font>) voice held an edge of derision now.
<div class="bookquote">``I'm not going to tell anybody.''  (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div>I said each word slowly, carefully controlling my anger.
Surprise flitted across his (<font color='blue'><b>actor</b></font>) face. <div class="bookquote">``Then why does it matter?''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``It matters to me,''  (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div>I insisted. <div class="bookquote">``I don't like to lie  so there'd better be a good reason why I'm doing it.''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``Can't you just thank me and get over it?''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``Thank you.''  (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div>I waited, fuming and expectant.
<div class="bookquote">``You're not going to let it go, are you?''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``No.''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``In that case I hope you enjoy disappointment.''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>We scowled at each other in silence. I was the first to speak, trying to keep myself focused. I was in
danger of being distracted by his (<font color='blue'><b>actor</b></font>) livid, glorious face. It was like trying to stare down a destroying angel.
<div class="bookquote">``Why did you even bother?''  (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div>I asked frigidly.
He (<font color='blue'><b>actor</b></font>) paused, and for a brief moment his (<font color='blue'><b>actor</b></font>) stunning face was unexpectedly vulnerable.
<div class="bookquote">``I don't know,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>actor</b></font>) whispered.
And then he (<font color='blue'><b>actor</b></font>) turned his (<font color='blue'><b>actor</b></font>) back on me and walked away.
I was so angry, it took me a few minutes until I could move. When I could walk, I made my way slowly
to the exit at the end of the hallway.
The waiting room was more unpleasant than I'd feared. It seemed like every face I knew in Forks was
there, staring at me. Charlie rushed to my side; I put up my hands.
<div class="bookquote">``There's nothing wrong with me,''  (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div>I assured him (<font color='blue'><b>Charlie</b></font>) sullenly. I was still aggravated, not in the mood for
chitchat.
<div class="bookquote">``What did the doctor say?''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``Dr. Cullen saw me, and he (<font color='blue'><b>Cullen</b></font>) said I was fine and I could go home.''  (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div>I sighed. Mike and Jessica and Eric
were all there, beginning to converge on us. <div class="bookquote">``Let's go,''  (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div>I urged.
Charlie put one arm behind my back, not quite touching me, and led me to the glass doors of the exit. I
waved sheepishly at my friends, hoping to convey that they didn't need to worry anymore. It was a huge
relief the first time I'd ever felt that way  to get into the cruiser.
We drove in silence. I was so wrapped up in my thoughts that I barely knew Charlie was there. I was
positive that Edward's defensive behavior in the hall was a confirmation of the bizarre things I still could

<p/>hardly believe I'd witnessed.
When we got to the house, Charlie finally spoke.
<div class="bookquote">``Um you'll need to call Rene.''  (<font color='red'><b>He</b></font>)</div>He (<font color='blue'><b>Charlie</b></font>) hung his (<font color='blue'><b>Charlie</b></font>) head, guilty.
I was appalled. <div class="bookquote">``You told Mom!''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``Sorry.''
 (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div>I slammed the cruiser's door a little harder than necessary on my way out.
My mom was in hysterics, of course. I had to tell her (<font color='blue'><b>mom</b></font>) I felt fine at least thirty times before she (<font color='blue'><b>mom</b></font>) would calm
down. She (<font color='blue'><b>mom</b></font>) begged me to come home  forgetting the fact that home was empty at the moment  but
her (<font color='blue'><b>mom</b></font>) pleas were easier to resist than I would have thought. I was consumed by the mystery Edward
presented. And more than a little obsessed by Edward himself. Stupid, stupid, stupid. I wasn't as eager
to escape Forks as I should be, as any normal, sane person would be.
I decided I might as well go to bed early that night. Charlie continued to watch me anxiously, and it was
getting on my nerves. I stopped on my way to grab three Tylenol from the bathroom. They did help, and,
as the pain eased, I drifted to sleep.
That was the first night I dreamed of Edward Cullen.

<p/>4. INVITATIONS

<p/>In my dream it was very dark, and what dim light there was seemed to be radiating from Edward's skin. I
couldn't see his (<font color='blue'><b>Edward</b></font>) face, just his (<font color='blue'><b>Edward</b></font>) back as he (<font color='blue'><b>Edward</b></font>) walked away from me, leaving me in the blackness. No matter
how fast I ran, I couldn't catch up to him (<font color='blue'><b>Edward</b></font>); no matter how loud I called, he (<font color='blue'><b>Edward</b></font>) never turned. Troubled, I woke
in the middle of the night and couldn't sleep again for what seemed like a very long time. After that, he (<font color='blue'><b>Edward</b></font>)
was in my dreams nearly every night, but always on the periphery, never within reach.
The month that followed the accident was uneasy, tense, and, at first, embarrassing.
To my dismay, I found myself the center of attention for the rest of that week. Tyler Crowley was
impossible, following me around, obsessed with making amends to me somehow. I tried to convince him (<font color='blue'><b>Crowley</b></font>)
what I wanted more than anything else was for him (<font color='blue'><b>Crowley</b></font>) to forget all about it  especially since nothing had
actually happened to me  but he (<font color='blue'><b>Crowley</b></font>) remained insistent. He (<font color='blue'><b>Crowley</b></font>) followed me between classes and sat at our
now-crowded lunch table. Mike and Eric were even less friendly toward him (<font color='blue'><b>Mike</b></font>) than they were to each
other, which made me worry that I'd gained another unwelcome fan.
No one seemed concerned about Edward, though I explained over and over that he (<font color='blue'><b>Edward</b></font>) was the hero 
how he (<font color='blue'><b>Edward</b></font>) had pulled me out of the way and had nearly been crushed, too. I tried to be convincing. Jessica,
Mike, Eric, and everyone else always commented that they hadn't even seen him (<font color='blue'><b>Eric</b></font>) there till the van was
pulled away.
I wondered to myself why no one else had seen him (<font color='blue'><b>Eric</b></font>) standing so far away, before he (<font color='blue'><b>Eric</b></font>) was suddenly,
impossibly saving my life. With chagrin, I realized the probable cause  no one else was as aware of
Edward as I always was. No one else watched him (<font color='blue'><b>Edward</b></font>) the way I did. How pitiful.
Edward was never surrounded by crowds of curious bystanders eager for his (<font color='blue'><b>Edward</b></font>) firsthand account. People

<p/>avoided him (<font color='blue'><b>Edward</b></font>) as usual. The Cullens and the Hales sat at the same table as always, not eating, talking only
among themselves. None of them, especially Edward, glanced my way anymore.
When he (<font color='blue'><b>Edward</b></font>) sat next to me in class, as far from me as the table would allow, he (<font color='blue'><b>Edward</b></font>) seemed totally unaware of
my presence. Only now and then, when his (<font color='blue'><b>Edward</b></font>) fists would suddenly ball up  skin stretched even whiter
over the bones  did I wonder if he (<font color='blue'><b>Edward</b></font>) wasn't quite as oblivious as he (<font color='blue'><b>Edward</b></font>) appeared.
He (<font color='blue'><b>Edward</b></font>) wished he (<font color='blue'><b>Edward</b></font>) hadn't pulled me from the path of Tyler's van  there was no other conclusion I could
come to.
I wanted very much to talk to him (<font color='blue'><b>Tyler</b></font>), and the day after the accident I tried. The last time I'd seen him (<font color='blue'><b>Tyler</b></font>),
outside the ER, we'd both been so furious. I still was angry that he (<font color='blue'><b>Tyler</b></font>) wouldn't trust me with the truth, even
though I was keeping my part of the bargain flawlessly. But he (<font color='blue'><b>Tyler</b></font>) had in fact saved my life, no matter how
he (<font color='blue'><b>Tyler</b></font>)'d done it. And, overnight, the heat of my anger faded into awed gratitude.
He (<font color='blue'><b>Tyler</b></font>) was already seated when I got to Biology, looking straight ahead. I sat down, expecting him (<font color='blue'><b>Tyler</b></font>) to turn
toward me. He (<font color='blue'><b>Tyler</b></font>) showed no sign that he (<font color='blue'><b>Tyler</b></font>) realized I was there.
<div class="bookquote">``Hello, Edward,''  (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div>I said pleasantly, to show him (<font color='blue'><b>Tyler</b></font>) I was going to behave myself.
He (<font color='blue'><b>Tyler</b></font>) turned his (<font color='blue'><b>Tyler</b></font>) head a fraction toward me without meeting my gaze, nodded once, and then looked the
other way.
And that was the last contact I'd had with him (<font color='blue'><b>Tyler</b></font>), though he (<font color='blue'><b>Tyler</b></font>) was there, a foot away from me, every day. I
watched him (<font color='blue'><b>Tyler</b></font>) sometimes, unable to stop myself from a distance, though, in the cafeteria or parking lot. I
watched as his (<font color='blue'><b>Tyler</b></font>) golden eyes grew perceptibly darker day by day. But in class I gave no more notice that
he (<font color='blue'><b>Tyler</b></font>) existed than he (<font color='blue'><b>Tyler</b></font>) showed toward me. I was miserable. And the dreams continued.
Despite my outright lies, the tenor of my e-mails alerted Rene to my depression, and she (<font color='blue'><b>me</b></font>) called a few
times, worried. I tried to convince her (<font color='blue'><b>me</b></font>) it was just the weather that had me down.
Mike, at least, was pleased by the obvious coolness between me and my lab partner. I could see he (<font color='blue'><b>Mike</b></font>)'d
been worried that Edward's daring rescue might have impressed me, and he (<font color='blue'><b>Edward</b></font>) was relieved that it seemed
to have the opposite effect. He (<font color='blue'><b>Edward</b></font>) grew more confident, sitting on the edge of my table to talk before
Biology class started, ignoring Edward as completely as he (<font color='blue'><b>Edward</b></font>) ignored us.
The snow washed away for good after that one dangerously icy day. Mike was disappointed he (<font color='blue'><b>Mike</b></font>)'d never
gotten to stage his (<font color='blue'><b>Mike</b></font>) snowball fight, but pleased that the beach trip would soon be possible. The rain
continued heavily, though, and the weeks passed.
Jessica made me aware of another event looming on the horizon  she (<font color='blue'><b>Jessica</b></font>) called the first Tuesday of March
to ask my permission to invite Mike to the girls' choice spring dance in two weeks.
<div class="bookquote">``Are you sure you don't mind you weren't planning to ask him (<font color='blue'><b>Edward</b></font>)?''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Jessica</b></font>) persisted when I told her (<font color='blue'><b>Jessica</b></font>) I didn't
mind in the least.
<div class="bookquote">``No, Jess, I'm not going,''  (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div>I assured her (<font color='blue'><b>Jessica</b></font>). Dancing was glaringly outside my range of abilities.
<div class="bookquote">``It will be really fun.''  (<font color='red'><b>me</b></font>)</div>Her (<font color='blue'><b>Jessica</b></font>) attempt to convince me was halfhearted. I suspected that Jessica enjoyed my
inexplicable popularity more than my actual company.
<div class="bookquote">``You have fun with Mike,''  (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div>I encouraged.
The next day, I was surprised that Jessica wasn't her (<font color='blue'><b>Jessica</b></font>) usual gushing self in Trig and Spanish. She (<font color='blue'><b>Jessica</b></font>) was

<p/>silent as she (<font color='blue'><b>Jessica</b></font>) walked by my side between classes, and I was afraid to ask her (<font color='blue'><b>Jessica</b></font>) why. If Mike had turned her (<font color='blue'><b>Jessica</b></font>)
down, I was the last person she (<font color='blue'><b>Jessica</b></font>) would want to tell.
My fears were strengthened during lunch when Jessica sat as far from Mike as possible, chatting
animatedly with Eric. Mike was unusually quiet.
Mike was still quiet as he (<font color='blue'><b>Mike</b></font>) walked me to class, the uncomfortable look on his (<font color='blue'><b>Mike</b></font>) face a bad sign. But he (<font color='blue'><b>Mike</b></font>)
didn't broach the subject until I was in my seat and he (<font color='blue'><b>Mike</b></font>) was perched on my desk. As always, I was
electrically aware of Edward sitting close enough to touch, as distant as if he (<font color='blue'><b>Edward</b></font>) were merely an invention of
my imagination.
<div class="bookquote">``So,''  (<font color='red'><b>Mike/Mike Newton/Newton</b></font>)</div>Mike said, looking at the floor, <div class="bookquote">``Jessica asked me to the spring dance.''
 (<font color='red'><b>Mike/Mike Newton/Newton</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``That's great.''  (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div>I made my voice bright and enthusiastic. <div class="bookquote">``You'll have a lot of fun with Jessica.''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``Well''  (<font color='red'><b>He</b></font>)</div>He (<font color='blue'><b>Mike</b></font>) floundered as he (<font color='blue'><b>Mike</b></font>) examined my smile, clearly not happy with my response. <div class="bookquote">``I told her (<font color='blue'><b>Jessica</b></font>) I had
to think about it.''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``Why would you do that?''  (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div>I let disapproval color my tone, though I was relieved he (<font color='blue'><b>Mike</b></font>) hadn't given her (<font color='blue'><b>my</b></font>) an
absolute no.
His (<font color='blue'><b>Mike</b></font>) face was bright red as he (<font color='blue'><b>Mike</b></font>) looked down again. Pity shook my resolve.
<div class="bookquote">``I was wondering if well, if you might be planning to ask me.''
 (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div>I paused for a moment, hating the wave of guilt that swept through me. But I saw, from the corner of my
eye, Edward's head tilt reflexively in my direction.
<div class="bookquote">``Mike, I think you should tell her (<font color='blue'><b>Jessica</b></font>) yes,''  (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div>I said.
<div class="bookquote">``Did you already ask someone?''  (<font color='red'><b>Edward/Edward Cullen/Cullen</b></font>)</div>Did Edward notice how Mike's eyes flickered in his (<font color='blue'><b>Mike</b></font>) direction?
<div class="bookquote">``No,''  (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div>I assured him (<font color='blue'><b>Mike</b></font>). <div class="bookquote">``I'm not going to the dance at all.''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``Why not?''  (<font color='red'><b>Mike/Mike Newton/Newton</b></font>)</div>Mike demanded.
I didn't want to get into the safety hazards that dancing presented, so I quickly made new plans.
<div class="bookquote">``I'm going to Seattle that Saturday,''  (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div>I explained. I needed to get out of town anyway  it was suddenly
the perfect time to go.
<div class="bookquote">``Can't you go some other weekend?''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``Sorry, no,''  (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div>I said. <div class="bookquote">``So you shouldn't make Jess wait any longer  it's rude.''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``Yeah, you're right,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Mike</b></font>) mumbled, and turned, dejected, to walk back to his (<font color='blue'><b>Mike</b></font>) seat. I closed my eyes and
pressed my fingers to my temples, trying to push the guilt and sympathy out of my head. Mr. Banner
began talking. I sighed and opened my eyes.
And Edward was staring at me curiously, that same, familiar edge of frustration even more distinct now in
his (<font color='blue'><b>Edward</b></font>) black eyes.
I stared back, surprised, expecting him (<font color='blue'><b>Edward</b></font>) to look quickly away. But instead he (<font color='blue'><b>Edward</b></font>) continued to gaze with
probing intensity into my eyes. There was no question of me looking away. My hands started to shake.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Mr. Cullen?''  (<font color='red'><b>the teacher</b></font>)</div>the teacher called, seeking the answer to a question that I hadn't heard.
<div class="bookquote">``The Krebs Cycle,''  (<font color='red'><b>Edward/Edward Cullen/Cullen</b></font>)</div>Edward answered, seeming reluctant as he (<font color='blue'><b>Edward</b></font>) turned to look at Mr. Banner.
I looked down at my book as soon as his (<font color='blue'><b>Edward</b></font>) eyes released me, trying to find my place. Cowardly as ever, I
shifted my hair over my right shoulder to hide my face. I couldn't believe the rush of emotion pulsing
through me  just because he (<font color='blue'><b>Edward</b></font>)'d happened to look at me for the first time in a half-dozen weeks. I
couldn't allow him (<font color='blue'><b>Edward</b></font>) to have this level of influence over me. It was pathetic. More than pathetic, it was
unhealthy.
I tried very hard not to be aware of him (<font color='blue'><b>Edward</b></font>) for the rest of the hour, and, since that was impossible, at least
not to let him (<font color='blue'><b>Edward</b></font>) know that I was aware of him (<font color='blue'><b>Edward</b></font>). When the bell rang at last, I turned my back to him (<font color='blue'><b>Edward</b></font>) to gather
my things, expecting him (<font color='blue'><b>Edward</b></font>) to leave immediately as usual.
<div class="bookquote">``Bella?''  (<font color='red'><b>me</b></font>)</div>His (<font color='blue'><b>Edward</b></font>) voice shouldn't have been so familiar to me, as if I'd known the sound of it all my life rather
than for just a few short weeks.
I turned slowly, unwillingly. I didn't want to feel what I knew I would feel when I looked at his (<font color='blue'><b>Edward</b></font>)
too-perfect face. My expression was wary when I finally turned to him (<font color='blue'><b>Edward</b></font>); his (<font color='blue'><b>Edward</b></font>) expression was unreadable.
He (<font color='blue'><b>Edward</b></font>) didn't say anything.
<div class="bookquote">``What? Are you speaking to me again?''  (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div>I finally asked, an unintentional note of petulance in my voice.
His (<font color='blue'><b>Edward</b></font>) lips twitched, fighting a smile. <div class="bookquote">``No, not really,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Edward</b></font>) admitted.
I closed my eyes and inhaled slowly through my nose, aware that I was gritting my teeth. He (<font color='blue'><b>Edward</b></font>) waited.
<div class="bookquote">``Then what do you want, Edward?''  (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div>I asked, keeping my eyes closed; it was easier to talk to him (<font color='blue'><b>Edward</b></font>)
coherently that way.
<div class="bookquote">``I'm sorry.''  (<font color='red'><b>He</b></font>)</div>He (<font color='blue'><b>Edward</b></font>) sounded sincere. <div class="bookquote">``I'm being very rude, I know. But it's better this way, really.''
 (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div>I opened my eyes. His (<font color='blue'><b>Edward</b></font>) face was very serious.
<div class="bookquote">``I don't know what you mean,''  (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div>I said, my voice guarded.
<div class="bookquote">``It's better if we're not friends,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Edward</b></font>) explained. <div class="bookquote">``Trust me.''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>My eyes narrowed. I'd heard that before.
<div class="bookquote">``It's too bad you didn't figure that out earlier,''  (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div>I hissed through my teeth. <div class="bookquote">``You could have saved yourself
all this regret.''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``Regret?''  (<font color='red'><b>him</b></font>)</div>The word, and my tone, obviously caught him (<font color='blue'><b>Edward</b></font>) off guard. <div class="bookquote">``Regret for what?''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``For not just letting that stupid van squish me.''
 (<font color='red'><b>He</b></font>)</div>He (<font color='blue'><b>Edward</b></font>) was astonished. He (<font color='blue'><b>Edward</b></font>) stared at me in disbelief.
When he (<font color='blue'><b>Edward</b></font>) finally spoke, he (<font color='blue'><b>Edward</b></font>) almost sounded mad. <div class="bookquote">``You think I regret saving your life?''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``I know you do,''  (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div>I snapped.
<div class="bookquote">``You don't know anything.''  (<font color='red'><b>He</b></font>)</div>He (<font color='blue'><b>Edward</b></font>) was definitely mad.
I turned my head sharply away from him (<font color='blue'><b>Edward</b></font>), clenching my jaw against all the wild accusations I wanted to

<p/>hurl at him (<font color='blue'><b>Edward</b></font>). I gathered my books together, then stood and walked to the door. I meant to sweep
dramatically out of the room, but of course I caught the toe of my boot on the door jamb and dropped
my books. I stood there for a moment, thinking about leaving them. Then I sighed and bent to pick them
up. He (<font color='blue'><b>Edward</b></font>) was there; he (<font color='blue'><b>Edward</b></font>)'d already stacked them into a pile. He (<font color='blue'><b>Edward</b></font>) handed them to me, his (<font color='blue'><b>Edward</b></font>) face hard.
<div class="bookquote">``Thank you,''  (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div>I said icily.
His (<font color='blue'><b>Edward</b></font>) eyes narrowed.
<div class="bookquote">``You're welcome,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Edward</b></font>) retorted.
I straightened up swiftly, turned away from him (<font color='blue'><b>Edward</b></font>) again, and stalked off to Gym without looking back.
Gym was brutal. We'd moved on to basketball. My team never passed me the ball, so that was good,
but I fell down a lot. Sometimes I took people with me. Today I was worse than usual because my head
was so filled with Edward. I tried to concentrate on my feet, but he (<font color='blue'><b>Edward</b></font>) kept creeping back into my thoughts
just when I really needed my balance.
It was a relief, as always, to leave. I almost ran to the truck; there were just so many people I wanted to
avoid. The truck had suffered only minimal damage in the accident. I'd had to replace the taillights, and if
I'd had a real paint job, I would have touched that up. Tyler's parents had to sell their van for parts.
I almost had a stroke when I rounded the corner and saw a tall, dark figure leaning against the side of my
truck. Then I realized it was just Eric. I started walking again.
<div class="bookquote">``Hey, Eric,''  (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div>I called.
<div class="bookquote">``Hi, Bella.''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``What's up?''  (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div>I said as I was unlocking the door. I wasn't paying attention to the uncomfortable edge in
his (<font color='blue'><b>Eric</b></font>) voice, so his (<font color='blue'><b>Eric</b></font>) next words took me by surprise.
<div class="bookquote">``Uh, I was just wondering if you would go to the spring dance with me?''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>His (<font color='blue'><b>Eric</b></font>) voice broke on the last
word.
<div class="bookquote">``I thought it was girls' choice,''  (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div>I said, too startled to be diplomatic.
<div class="bookquote">``Well, yeah,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Eric</b></font>) admitted, shamefaced.
I recovered my composure and tried to make my smile warm. <div class="bookquote">``Thank you for asking me, but I'm going to
be in Seattle that day.''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``Oh,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Eric</b></font>) said. <div class="bookquote">``Well, maybe next time.''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``Sure,''  (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div>I agreed, and then bit my lip. I wouldn't want him (<font color='blue'><b>Eric</b></font>) to take that too literally.
He (<font color='blue'><b>Eric</b></font>) slouched off, back toward the school. I heard a low chuckle.
Edward was walking past the front of my truck, looking straight forward, his (<font color='blue'><b>Edward</b></font>) lips pressed together. I
yanked the door open and jumped inside, slamming it loudly behind me. I revved the engine deafeningly
and reversed out into the aisle. Edward was in his (<font color='blue'><b>Edward</b></font>) car already, two spaces down, sliding out smoothly in
front of me, cutting me off. He (<font color='blue'><b>Edward</b></font>) stopped there  to wait for his (<font color='blue'><b>Edward</b></font>) family; I could see the four of them
walking this way, but still by the cafeteria. I considered taking out the rear of his (<font color='blue'><b>Edward</b></font>) shiny Volvo, but there
were too many witnesses. I looked in my rearview mirror. A line was beginning to form. Directly behind
me, Tyler Crowley was in his (<font color='blue'><b>Crowley</b></font>) recently acquired used Sentra, waving. I was too aggravated to

<p/>acknowledge him (<font color='blue'><b>Crowley</b></font>).
While I was sitting there, looking everywhere but at the car in front of me, I heard a knock on my
passenger side window. I looked over; it was Tyler. I glanced back in my rearview mirror, confused. His (<font color='blue'><b>Tyler</b></font>)
car was still running, the door left open. I leaned across the cab to crank the window down. It was stiff. I
got it halfway down, then gave up.
<div class="bookquote">``I'm sorry, Tyler, I'm stuck behind Cullen.''  (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div>I was annoyed  obviously the holdup wasn't my fault.
<div class="bookquote">``Oh, I know  I just wanted to ask you something while we're trapped here.''  (<font color='red'><b>He</b></font>)</div>He (<font color='blue'><b>Tyler</b></font>) grinned.
This could not be happening.
<div class="bookquote">``Will you ask me to the spring dance?''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Tyler</b></font>) continued.
<div class="bookquote">``I'm not going to be in town, Tyler.''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>My voice sounded a little sharp. I had to remember it wasn't his (<font color='blue'><b>Tyler</b></font>) fault
that Mike and Eric had already used up my quota of patience for the day.
<div class="bookquote">``Yeah, Mike said that,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Mike</b></font>) admitted.
<div class="bookquote">``Then why ''
 (<font color='red'><b>He</b></font>)</div>He (<font color='blue'><b>Mike</b></font>) shrugged. <div class="bookquote">``I was hoping you were just letting him (<font color='blue'><b>Mike</b></font>) down easy.''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>Okay, it was completely his (<font color='blue'><b>Mike</b></font>) fault.
<div class="bookquote">``Sorry, Tyler,''  (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div>I said, working to hide my irritation. <div class="bookquote">``I really am going out of town.''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``That's cool. We still have prom.''
 (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div>And before I could respond, he (<font color='blue'><b>Mike</b></font>) was walking back to his (<font color='blue'><b>Mike</b></font>) car. I could feel the shock on my face. I looked
forward to see Alice, Rosalie, Emmett, and Jasper all sliding into the Volvo. In his (<font color='blue'><b>Jasper</b></font>) rearview mirror,
Edward's eyes were on me. He (<font color='blue'><b>Edward</b></font>) was unquestionably shaking with laughter, as if he (<font color='blue'><b>Edward</b></font>)'d heard every word
Tyler had said. My foot itched toward the gas pedal one little bump wouldn't hurt any of them, just that
glossy silver paint job. I revved the engine.
But they were all in, and Edward was speeding away. I drove home slowly, carefully, muttering to myself
the whole way.
When I got home, I decided to make chicken enchiladas for dinner. It was a long process, and it would
keep me busy. While I was simmering the onions and chilies, the phone rang. I was almost afraid to
answer it, but it might be Charlie or my mom.
It was Jessica, and she (<font color='blue'><b>Jessica</b></font>) was jubilant; Mike had caught her (<font color='blue'><b>Jessica</b></font>) after school to accept her (<font color='blue'><b>Jessica</b></font>) invitation. I
celebrated with her (<font color='blue'><b>Jessica</b></font>) briefly while I stirred. She (<font color='blue'><b>Jessica</b></font>) had to go, she (<font color='blue'><b>Jessica</b></font>) wanted to call Angela and Lauren to tell
them. I suggested  with casual innocence  that maybe Angela, the shy girl who had Biology with me,
could ask Eric. And Lauren, a standoffish girl who had always ignored me at the lunch table, could ask
Tyler; I'd heard he (<font color='blue'><b>Tyler</b></font>) was still available. Jess thought that was a great idea. Now that she (<font color='blue'><b>Jess</b></font>) was sure of Mike,
she (<font color='blue'><b>Jess</b></font>) actually sounded sincere when she (<font color='blue'><b>Jess</b></font>) said she (<font color='blue'><b>Jess</b></font>) wished I would go to the dance. I gave her (<font color='blue'><b>Jess</b></font>) my Seattle
excuse.
After I hung up, I tried to concentrate on dinner  dicing the chicken especially; I didn't want to take
another trip to the emergency room. But my head was spinning, trying to analyze every word Edward
had spoken today. What did he (<font color='blue'><b>Edward</b></font>) mean, it was better if we weren't friends?

<p/>My stomach twisted as I realized what he (<font color='blue'><b>Edward</b></font>) must have meant. He (<font color='blue'><b>Edward</b></font>) must see how absorbed I was by him (<font color='blue'><b>Edward</b></font>); he (<font color='blue'><b>Edward</b></font>)
must not want to lead me on so we couldn't even be friends because he (<font color='blue'><b>Edward</b></font>) wasn't interested in me at
all.
Of course he (<font color='blue'><b>Edward</b></font>) wasn't interested in me, I thought angrily, my eyes stinging  a delayed reaction to the
onions. I wasn't interesting. And he (<font color='blue'><b>Edward</b></font>) was. Interesting and brilliant and mysterious and perfect
and beautiful and possibly able to lift full-sized vans with one hand.
Well, that was fine. I could leave him (<font color='blue'><b>Edward</b></font>) alone. I would leave him (<font color='blue'><b>Edward</b></font>) alone. I would get through my
self-imposed sentence here in purgatory, and then hopefully some school in the Southwest, or possibly
Hawaii, would offer me a scholarship. I focused my thoughts on sunny beaches and palm trees as I
finished the enchiladas and put them in the oven.
Charlie seemed suspicious when he (<font color='blue'><b>Charlie</b></font>) came home and smelled the green peppers. I couldn't blame him (<font color='blue'><b>Charlie</b></font>) 
the closest edible Mexican food was probably in southern California. But he (<font color='blue'><b>Charlie</b></font>) was a cop, even if just a
small-town cop, so he (<font color='blue'><b>Charlie</b></font>) was brave enough to take the first bite. He (<font color='blue'><b>Charlie</b></font>) seemed to like it. It was fun to watch
as he (<font color='blue'><b>Charlie</b></font>) slowly began trusting me in the kitchen.
<div class="bookquote">``Dad?''  (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div>I asked when he (<font color='blue'><b>Charlie</b></font>) was almost done.
<div class="bookquote">``Yeah, Bella?''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``Um, I just wanted to let you know that I'm going to Seattle for the day a week from Saturday if that's
okay?''  (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div>I didn't want to ask permission  it set a bad precedent  but I felt rude, so I tacked it on at
the end.
<div class="bookquote">``Why?''  (<font color='red'><b>He</b></font>)</div>He (<font color='blue'><b>Charlie</b></font>) sounded surprised, as if he (<font color='blue'><b>Charlie</b></font>) were unable to imagine something that Forks couldn't offer.
<div class="bookquote">``Well, I wanted to get few books  the library here is pretty limited  and maybe look at some
clothes.''  (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div>I had more money than I was used to having, since, thanks to Charlie, I hadn't had to pay for a
car. Not that the truck didn't cost me quite a bit in the gas department.
<div class="bookquote">``That truck probably doesn't get very good gas mileage,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Charlie</b></font>) said, echoing my thoughts.
<div class="bookquote">``I know, I'll stop in Montesano and Olympia  and Tacoma if I have to.''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``Are you going all by yourself?''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Charlie</b></font>) asked, and I couldn't tell if he (<font color='blue'><b>Charlie</b></font>) was suspicious I had a secret boyfriend
or just worried about car trouble.
<div class="bookquote">``Yes.''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``Seattle is a big city  you could get lost,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Charlie</b></font>) fretted.
<div class="bookquote">``Dad, Phoenix is five times the size of Seattle  and I can read a map, don't worry about it.''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``Do you want me to come with you?''
 (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div>I tried to be crafty as I hid my horror.
<div class="bookquote">``That's all right, Dad, I'll probably just be in dressing rooms all day  very boring.''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``Oh, okay.''  (<font color='red'><b>women</b></font>)</div>The thought of sitting in women's clothing stores for any period of time immediately put him (<font color='blue'><b>Charlie</b></font>)
off.
<div class="bookquote">``Thanks.''  (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div>I smiled at him (<font color='blue'><b>Charlie</b></font>).

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Will you be back in time for the dance?''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>Grrr. Only in a town this small would a father know when the high school dances were.
<div class="bookquote">``No  I don't dance, Dad.''  (<font color='red'><b>He</b></font>)</div>He (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>), of all people, should understand that  I didn't get my balance
problems from my mother.
He (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) did understand. <div class="bookquote">``Oh, that's right,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) realized.
The next morning, when I pulled into the parking lot, I deliberately parked as far as possible from the
silver Volvo. I didn't want to put myself in the path of too much temptation and end up owing him (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) a new
car. Getting out of the cab, I fumbled with my key and it fell into a puddle at my feet. As I bent to get it, a
white hand flashed out and grabbed it before I could. I jerked upright. Edward Cullen was right next to
me, leaning casually against my truck.
<div class="bookquote">``How do you do that?''  (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div>I asked in amazed irritation.
<div class="bookquote">``Do what?''  (<font color='red'><b>He</b></font>)</div>He (<font color='blue'><b>Cullen</b></font>) held my key out as he (<font color='blue'><b>Cullen</b></font>) spoke. As I reached for it, he (<font color='blue'><b>Cullen</b></font>) dropped it into my palm.
<div class="bookquote">``Appear out of thin air.''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``Bella, it's not my fault if you are exceptionally unobservant.''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>His (<font color='blue'><b>Cullen</b></font>) voice was quiet as usual  velvet,
muted.
I scowled at his (<font color='blue'><b>Cullen</b></font>) perfect face. His (<font color='blue'><b>Cullen</b></font>) eyes were light again today, a deep, golden honey color. Then I had to
look down, to reassemble my now-tangled thoughts.
<div class="bookquote">``Why the traffic jam last night?''  (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div>I demanded, still looking away. <div class="bookquote">``I thought you were supposed to be
pretending I don't exist, not irritating me to death.''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``That was for Tyler's sake, not mine. I had to give him (<font color='blue'><b>Tyler</b></font>) his (<font color='blue'><b>Tyler</b></font>) chance.''  (<font color='red'><b>He</b></font>)</div>He (<font color='blue'><b>Cullen</b></font>) snickered.
<div class="bookquote">``You''  (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div>I gasped. I couldn't think of a bad enough word. It felt like the heat of my anger should
physically burn him (<font color='blue'><b>Cullen</b></font>), but he (<font color='blue'><b>Cullen</b></font>) only seemed more amused.
<div class="bookquote">``And I'm not pretending you don't exist,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Cullen</b></font>) continued.
<div class="bookquote">``So you are trying to irritate me to death? Since Tyler's van didn't do the job?''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>Anger flashed in his (<font color='blue'><b>Cullen</b></font>) tawny eyes. His (<font color='blue'><b>Cullen</b></font>) lips pressed into a hard line, all signs of humor gone.
<div class="bookquote">``Bella, you are utterly absurd,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Cullen</b></font>) said, his (<font color='blue'><b>Cullen</b></font>) low voice cold.
My palms tingled  I wanted so badly to hit something. I was surprised at myself. I was usually a
nonviolent person. I turned my back and started to walk away.
<div class="bookquote">``Wait,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Cullen</b></font>) called. I kept walking, sloshing angrily through the rain. But he (<font color='blue'><b>Cullen</b></font>) was next to me, easily keeping
pace.
<div class="bookquote">``I'm sorry, that was rude,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Cullen</b></font>) said as we walked. I ignored him (<font color='blue'><b>Cullen</b></font>). <div class="bookquote">``I'm not saying it isn't true,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Cullen</b></font>) continued,
<div class="bookquote">``but it was rude to say it, anyway.''
 (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``Why won't you leave me alone?''  (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div>I grumbled.
<div class="bookquote">``I wanted to ask you something, but you sidetracked me,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Cullen</b></font>) chuckled. He (<font color='blue'><b>Cullen</b></font>) seemed to have recovered

<p/>his (<font color='blue'><b>Cullen</b></font>) good humor.
<div class="bookquote">``Do you have a multiple personality disorder?''  (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div>I asked severely.
<div class="bookquote">``You're doing it again.''
 (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div>I sighed. <div class="bookquote">``Fine then. What do you want to ask?''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``I was wondering if, a week from Saturday  you know, the day of the spring dance ''
 (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``Are you trying to be funny?''  (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div>I interrupted him (<font color='blue'><b>Cullen</b></font>), wheeling toward him (<font color='blue'><b>Cullen</b></font>). My face got drenched as I looked
up at his (<font color='blue'><b>Cullen</b></font>) expression.
His (<font color='blue'><b>Cullen</b></font>) eyes were wickedly amused. <div class="bookquote">``Will you please allow me to finish?''
 (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div>I bit my lip and clasped my hands together, interlocking my fingers, so I couldn't do anything rash.
<div class="bookquote">``I heard you say you were going to Seattle that day, and I was wondering if you wanted a ride.''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>That was unexpected.
<div class="bookquote">``What?''  (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div>I wasn't sure what he (<font color='blue'><b>Cullen</b></font>) was getting at.
<div class="bookquote">``Do you want a ride to Seattle?''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``With who?''  (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div>I asked, mystified.
<div class="bookquote">``Myself, obviously.''  (<font color='red'><b>He</b></font>)</div>He (<font color='blue'><b>Cullen</b></font>) enunciated every syllable, as if he (<font color='blue'><b>Cullen</b></font>) were talking to someone mentally
handicapped.
I was still stunned. <div class="bookquote">``Why?''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``Well, I was planning to go to Seattle in the next few weeks, and, to be honest, I'm not sure if your truck
can make it.''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``My truck works just fine, thank you very much for your concern.''  (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div>I started to walk again, but I was too
surprised to maintain the same level of anger.
<div class="bookquote">``But can your truck make it there on one tank of gas?''  (<font color='red'><b>He</b></font>)</div>He (<font color='blue'><b>Cullen</b></font>) matched my pace again.
<div class="bookquote">``I don't see how that is any of your business.''  (<font color='red'><b>Volvo</b></font>)</div>Stupid, shiny Volvo owner.
<div class="bookquote">``The wasting of finite resources is everyone's business.''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``Honestly, Edward.''  (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div>I felt a thrill go through me as I said his (<font color='blue'><b>Cullen</b></font>) name, and I hated it. <div class="bookquote">``I can't keep up with
you. I thought you didn't want to be my friend.''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``I said it would be better if we weren't friends, not that I didn't want to be.''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``Oh, thanks, now that's all cleared up.''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>Heavy sarcasm. I realized I had stopped walking again. We
were under the shelter of the cafeteria roof now, so I could more easily look at his (<font color='blue'><b>Cullen</b></font>) face. Which certainly
didn't help my clarity of thought.
<div class="bookquote">``It would be more prudent for you not to be my friend,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Cullen</b></font>) explained. <div class="bookquote">``But I'm tired of trying to stay
away from you, Bella.''

 (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div><p/>His (<font color='blue'><b>Cullen</b></font>) eyes were gloriously intense as he (<font color='blue'><b>Cullen</b></font>) uttered that last sentence, his (<font color='blue'><b>Cullen</b></font>) voice smoldering. I couldn't
remember how to breathe.
<div class="bookquote">``Will you go with me to Seattle?''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Cullen</b></font>) asked, still intense.
I couldn't speak yet, so I just nodded.
He (<font color='blue'><b>Cullen</b></font>) smiled briefly, and then his (<font color='blue'><b>Cullen</b></font>) face became serious.
<div class="bookquote">``You really should stay away from me,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Cullen</b></font>) warned. <div class="bookquote">``I'll see you in class.''
 (<font color='red'><b>He</b></font>)</div>He (<font color='blue'><b>Cullen</b></font>) turned abruptly and walked back the way we'd come.

<p/>5. BLOOD TYPE

<p/>I made my way to English in a daze. I didn't even realize when I first walked in that class had already
started.
<div class="bookquote">``Thank you for joining us, Miss Swan,''  (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Mason</b></font>)</div>Mr. Mason said in a disparaging tone.
I flushed and hurried to my seat.
It wasn't till class ended that I realized Mike wasn't sitting in his (<font color='blue'><b>Mike</b></font>) usual seat next to me. I felt a twinge of
guilt. But he (<font color='blue'><b>Mike</b></font>) and Eric both met me at the door as usual, so I figured I wasn't totally unforgiven. Mike
seemed to become more himself as we walked, gaining enthusiasm as he (<font color='blue'><b>Mike</b></font>) talked about the weather report
for this weekend. The rain was supposed to take a minor break, and so maybe his (<font color='blue'><b>Mike</b></font>) beach trip would be
possible. I tried to sound eager, to make up for disappointing him (<font color='blue'><b>Mike</b></font>) yesterday. It was hard; rain or no rain,
it would still only be in the high forties, if we were lucky.
The rest of the morning passed in a blur. It was difficult to believe that I hadn't just imagined what
Edward had said, and the way his (<font color='blue'><b>Edward</b></font>) eyes had looked. Maybe it was just a very convincing dream that I'd
confused with reality. That seemed more probable than that I really appealed to him (<font color='blue'><b>Edward</b></font>) on any level.
So I was impatient and frightened as Jessica and I entered the cafeteria. I wanted to see his (<font color='blue'><b>Edward</b></font>) face, to see if
he (<font color='blue'><b>Edward</b></font>)'d gone back to the cold, indifferent person I'd known for the last several weeks. Or if, by some
miracle, I'd really heard what I thought I'd heard this morning. Jessica babbled on and on about her (<font color='blue'><b>Jessica</b></font>)
dance plans  Lauren and Angela had asked the other boys and they were all going together 
completely unaware of my inattention.
Disappointment flooded through me as my eyes unerringly focused on his (<font color='blue'><b>Edward</b></font>) table. The other four were
there, but he (<font color='blue'><b>Edward</b></font>) was absent. Had he (<font color='blue'><b>Edward</b></font>) gone home? I followed the still-babbling Jessica through the line,
crushed. I'd lost my appetite  I bought nothing but a bottle of lemonade. I just wanted to go sit down
and sulk.
<div class="bookquote">``Edward Cullen is staring at you again,''  (<font color='red'><b>Jessica</b></font>)</div>Jessica said, finally breaking through my abstraction with his (<font color='blue'><b>Edward</b></font>)
name. <div class="bookquote">``I wonder why he (<font color='blue'><b>Cullen</b></font>)'s sitting alone today.''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>My head snapped up. I followed her (<font color='blue'><b>Jessica</b></font>) gaze to see Edward, smiling crookedly, staring at me from an empty
table across the cafeteria from where he (<font color='blue'><b>Edward</b></font>) usually sat. Once he (<font color='blue'><b>Edward</b></font>)'d caught my eye, he (<font color='blue'><b>Edward</b></font>) raised one hand and
motioned with his (<font color='blue'><b>Edward</b></font>) index finger for me to join him (<font color='blue'><b>Edward</b></font>). As I stared in disbelief, he (<font color='blue'><b>Edward</b></font>) winked.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Does he (<font color='blue'><b>Cullen</b></font>) mean you?''  (<font color='red'><b>Jessica</b></font>)</div>Jessica asked with insulting astonishment in her (<font color='blue'><b>Jessica</b></font>) voice.
<div class="bookquote">``Maybe he (<font color='blue'><b>Cullen</b></font>) needs help with his (<font color='blue'><b>Cullen</b></font>) Biology homework,''  (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div>I muttered for her (<font color='blue'><b>Jessica</b></font>) benefit. <div class="bookquote">``Um, I'd better go see
what he (<font color='blue'><b>Cullen</b></font>) wants.''
 (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div>I could feel her (<font color='blue'><b>Jessica</b></font>) staring after me as I walked away.
When I reached his (<font color='blue'><b>Edward</b></font>) table, I stood behind the chair across from him (<font color='blue'><b>Edward</b></font>), unsure.
<div class="bookquote">``Why don't you sit with me today?''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Edward</b></font>) asked, smiling.
I sat down automatically, watching him (<font color='blue'><b>Edward</b></font>) with caution. He (<font color='blue'><b>Edward</b></font>) was still smiling. It was hard to believe that
someone so beautiful could be real. I was afraid that he (<font color='blue'><b>Edward</b></font>) might disappear in a sudden puff of smoke, and I
would wake up.
He (<font color='blue'><b>Edward</b></font>) seemed to be waiting for me to say something.
<div class="bookquote">``This is different,''  (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div>I finally managed.
<div class="bookquote">``Well''  (<font color='red'><b>He</b></font>)</div>He (<font color='blue'><b>Edward</b></font>) paused, and then the rest of the words followed in a rush. <div class="bookquote">``I decided as long as I was going
to hell, I might as well do it thoroughly.''
 (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div>I waited for him (<font color='blue'><b>Edward</b></font>) to say something that made sense. The seconds ticked by.
<div class="bookquote">``You know I don't have any idea what you mean,''  (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div>I eventually pointed out.
<div class="bookquote">``I know.''  (<font color='red'><b>He</b></font>)</div>He (<font color='blue'><b>Edward</b></font>) smiled again, and then he (<font color='blue'><b>Edward</b></font>) changed the subject. <div class="bookquote">``I think your friends are angry with me for
stealing you.''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``They'll survive.''  (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div>I could feel their stares boring into my back.
<div class="bookquote">``I may not give you back, though,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Edward</b></font>) said with a wicked glint in his (<font color='blue'><b>Edward</b></font>) eyes.
I gulped.
He (<font color='blue'><b>Edward</b></font>) laughed. <div class="bookquote">``You look worried.''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``No,''  (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div>I said, but, ridiculously, my voice broke. <div class="bookquote">``Surprised, actually what brought all this on?''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``I told you  I got tired of trying to stay away from you. So I'm giving up.''  (<font color='red'><b>He</b></font>)</div>He (<font color='blue'><b>Edward</b></font>) was still smiling, but his (<font color='blue'><b>Edward</b></font>)
ocher eyes were serious.
<div class="bookquote">``Giving up?''  (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div>I repeated in confusion.
<div class="bookquote">``Yes  giving up trying to be good. I'm just going to do what I want now, and let the chips fall where
they may.''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>His (<font color='blue'><b>Edward</b></font>) smile faded as he (<font color='blue'><b>Edward</b></font>) explained, and a hard edge crept into his (<font color='blue'><b>Edward</b></font>) voice.
<div class="bookquote">``You lost me again.''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>The breathtaking crooked smile reappeared.
<div class="bookquote">``I always say too much when I'm talking to you  that's one of the problems.''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``Don't worry  I don't understand any of it,''  (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div>I said wryly.
<div class="bookquote">``I'm counting on that.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``So, in plain English, are we friends now?''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``Friends''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Edward</b></font>) mused, dubious.
<div class="bookquote">``Or not,''  (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div>I muttered.
He (<font color='blue'><b>Edward</b></font>) grinned. <div class="bookquote">``Well, we can try, I suppose. But I'm warning you now that I'm not a good friend for you.''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>Behind his (<font color='blue'><b>Edward</b></font>) smile, the warning was real.
<div class="bookquote">``You say that a lot,''  (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div>I noted, trying to ignore the sudden trembling in my stomach and keep my voice
even.
<div class="bookquote">``Yes, because you're not listening to me. I'm still waiting for you to believe it. If you're smart, you'll avoid
me.''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``I think you've made your opinion on the subject of my intellect clear, too.''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>My eyes narrowed.
He (<font color='blue'><b>Edward</b></font>) smiled apologetically.
<div class="bookquote">``So, as long as I'm being not smart, we'll try to be friends?''  (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div>I struggled to sum up the confusing
exchange.
<div class="bookquote">``That sounds about right.''
 (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div>I looked down at my hands wrapped around the lemonade bottle, not sure what to do now.
<div class="bookquote">``What are you thinking?''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Edward</b></font>) asked curiously.
I looked up into his (<font color='blue'><b>Edward</b></font>) deep gold eyes, became befuddled, and, as usual, blurted out the truth.
<div class="bookquote">``I'm trying to figure out what you are.''
 (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>His (<font color='blue'><b>Edward</b></font>) jaw tightened, but he (<font color='blue'><b>Edward</b></font>) kept his (<font color='blue'><b>Edward</b></font>) smile in place with some effort.
<div class="bookquote">``Are you having any luck with that?''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Edward</b></font>) asked in an offhand tone.
<div class="bookquote">``Not too much,''  (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div>I admitted.
He (<font color='blue'><b>Edward</b></font>) chuckled. <div class="bookquote">``What are your theories?''
 (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div>I blushed. I had been vacillating during the last month between Bruce Wayne and Peter Parker. There
was no way I was going to own up to that.
<div class="bookquote">``Won't you tell me?''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Parker</b></font>) asked, tilting his (<font color='blue'><b>Parker</b></font>) head to one side with a shockingly tempting smile.
I shook my head. <div class="bookquote">``Too embarrassing.''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``That's really frustrating, you know,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Parker</b></font>) complained.
<div class="bookquote">``No,''  (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div>I disagreed quickly, my eyes narrowing, <div class="bookquote">``I can't imagine why that would be frustrating at all 
just because someone refuses to tell you what they're thinking, even if all the while they're making cryptic
little remarks specifically designed to keep you up at night wondering what they could possibly mean
now, why would that be frustrating?''
 (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div>He (<font color='blue'><b>Parker</b></font>) grimaced.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Or better,''  (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div>I continued, the pent-up annoyance flowing freely now, <div class="bookquote">``say that person also did a wide
range of bizarre things  from saving your life under impossible circumstances one day to treating you
like a pariah the next, and he (<font color='blue'><b>you</b></font>) never explained any of that, either, even after he (<font color='blue'><b>you</b></font>) promised. That, also,
would be very non-frustrating.''
 (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``You've got a bit of a temper, don't you?''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``I don't like double standards.''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>We stared at each other, unsmiling.
He (<font color='blue'><b>Parker</b></font>) glanced over my shoulder, and then, unexpectedly, he (<font color='blue'><b>Parker</b></font>) snickered.
<div class="bookquote">``What?''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``Your boyfriend seems to think I'm being unpleasant to you  he (<font color='blue'><b>boyfriend</b></font>)'s debating whether or not to come
break up our fight.''  (<font color='red'><b>He</b></font>)</div>He (<font color='blue'><b>Parker</b></font>) snickered again.
<div class="bookquote">``I don't know who you're talking about,''  (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div>I said frostily. <div class="bookquote">``But I'm sure you're wrong, anyway.''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``I'm not. I told you, most people are easy to read.''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``Except me, of course.''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``Yes. Except for you.''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>His (<font color='blue'><b>Parker</b></font>) mood shifted suddenly; his (<font color='blue'><b>Parker</b></font>) eyes turned brooding. <div class="bookquote">``I wonder why that is.''
 (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div>I had to look away from the intensity of his (<font color='blue'><b>Parker</b></font>) stare. I concentrated on unscrewing the lid of my lemonade. I
took a swig, staring at the table without seeing it.
<div class="bookquote">``Aren't you hungry?''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Parker</b></font>) asked, distracted.
<div class="bookquote">``No.''  (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div>I didn't feel like mentioning that my stomach was already full  of butterflies. <div class="bookquote">``You?''  (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div>I looked at
the empty table in front of him (<font color='blue'><b>Parker</b></font>).
<div class="bookquote">``No, I'm not hungry.''  (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div>I didn't understand his (<font color='blue'><b>Parker</b></font>) expression  it looked like he (<font color='blue'><b>Parker</b></font>) was enjoying some private
joke.
<div class="bookquote">``Can you do me a favor?''  (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div>I asked after a second of hesitation.
He (<font color='blue'><b>Parker</b></font>) was suddenly wary. <div class="bookquote">``That depends on what you want.''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``It's not much,''  (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div>I assured him (<font color='blue'><b>Parker</b></font>).
He (<font color='blue'><b>Parker</b></font>) waited, guarded but curious.
<div class="bookquote">``I just wondered if you could warn me beforehand the next time you decide to ignore me for my own
good. Just so I'm prepared.''  (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div>I looked at the lemonade bottle as I spoke, tracing the circle of the opening
with my pinkie finger.
<div class="bookquote">``That sounds fair.''  (<font color='red'><b>He</b></font>)</div>He (<font color='blue'><b>Parker</b></font>) was pressing his (<font color='blue'><b>Parker</b></font>) lips together to keep from laughing when I looked up.
<div class="bookquote">``Thanks.''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``Then can I have one answer in return?''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Parker</b></font>) demanded.
<div class="bookquote">``One.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Tell me one theory.''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>Whoops. <div class="bookquote">``Not that one.''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``You didn't qualify, you just promised one answer,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Parker</b></font>) reminded me.
<div class="bookquote">``And you've broken promises yourself,''  (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div>I reminded him (<font color='blue'><b>Parker</b></font>) back.
<div class="bookquote">``Just one theory  I won't laugh.''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``Yes, you will.''  (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div>I was positive about that.
He (<font color='blue'><b>Parker</b></font>) looked down, and then glanced up at me through his (<font color='blue'><b>Parker</b></font>) long black lashes, his (<font color='blue'><b>Parker</b></font>) ocher eyes scorching.
<div class="bookquote">``Please?''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Parker</b></font>) breathed, leaning toward me.
I blinked, my mind going blank. Holy crow, how did he (<font color='blue'><b>Parker</b></font>) do that?
<div class="bookquote">``Er, what?''  (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div>I asked, dazed.
<div class="bookquote">``Please tell me just one little theory.''  (<font color='red'><b>me</b></font>)</div>His (<font color='blue'><b>Parker</b></font>) eyes still smoldered at me.
<div class="bookquote">``Um, well, bitten by a radioactive spider?''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>Was he (<font color='blue'><b>Parker</b></font>) a hypnotist, too? Or was I just a hopeless pushover?
<div class="bookquote">``That's not very creative,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Parker</b></font>) scoffed.
<div class="bookquote">``I'm sorry, that's all I've got,''  (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div>I said, miffed.
<div class="bookquote">``You're not even close,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Parker</b></font>) teased.
<div class="bookquote">``No spiders?''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``Nope.''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``And no radioactivity?''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``None.''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``Dang,''  (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div>I sighed.
<div class="bookquote">``Kryptonite doesn't bother me, either,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Parker</b></font>) chuckled.
<div class="bookquote">``You're not supposed to laugh, remember?''
 (<font color='red'><b>He</b></font>)</div>He (<font color='blue'><b>Parker</b></font>) struggled to compose his (<font color='blue'><b>Parker</b></font>) face.
<div class="bookquote">``I'll figure it out eventually,''  (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div>I warned him (<font color='blue'><b>Parker</b></font>).
<div class="bookquote">``I wish you wouldn't try.''  (<font color='red'><b>He</b></font>)</div>He (<font color='blue'><b>Parker</b></font>) was serious again.
<div class="bookquote">``Because ?''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``What if I'm not a superhero? What if I'm the bad guy?''  (<font color='red'><b>He</b></font>)</div>He (<font color='blue'><b>Parker</b></font>) smiled playfully, but his (<font color='blue'><b>Parker</b></font>) eyes were
impenetrable.
<div class="bookquote">``Oh,''  (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div>I said, as several things he (<font color='blue'><b>Parker</b></font>)'d hinted fell suddenly into place. <div class="bookquote">``I see.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Do you?''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>His (<font color='blue'><b>Parker</b></font>) face was abruptly severe, as if he (<font color='blue'><b>Parker</b></font>) were afraid that he (<font color='blue'><b>Parker</b></font>)'d accidentally said too much.
<div class="bookquote">``You're dangerous?''  (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div>I guessed, my pulse quickening as I intuitively realized the truth of my own words.
He (<font color='blue'><b>Parker</b></font>) was dangerous. He (<font color='blue'><b>Parker</b></font>)'d been trying to tell me that all along.
He (<font color='blue'><b>Parker</b></font>) just looked at me, eyes full of some emotion I couldn't comprehend.
<div class="bookquote">``But not bad,''  (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div>I whispered, shaking my head. <div class="bookquote">``No, I don't believe that you're bad.''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``You're wrong.''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>His (<font color='blue'><b>Parker</b></font>) voice was almost inaudible. He (<font color='blue'><b>Parker</b></font>) looked down, stealing my bottle lid and then
spinning it on its side between his (<font color='blue'><b>Parker</b></font>) fingers. I stared at him (<font color='blue'><b>Parker</b></font>), wondering why I didn't feel afraid. He (<font color='blue'><b>Parker</b></font>) meant
what he (<font color='blue'><b>Parker</b></font>) was saying  that was obvious. But I just felt anxious, on edge and, more than anything else,
fascinated. The same way I always felt when I was near him (<font color='blue'><b>Parker</b></font>).
The silence lasted until I noticed that the cafeteria was almost empty.
I jumped to my feet. <div class="bookquote">``We're going to be late.''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``I'm not going to class today,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Parker</b></font>) said, twirling the lid so fast it was just a blur.
<div class="bookquote">``Why not?''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``It's healthy to ditch class now and then.''  (<font color='red'><b>He</b></font>)</div>He (<font color='blue'><b>Parker</b></font>) smiled up at me, but his (<font color='blue'><b>Parker</b></font>) eyes were still troubled.
<div class="bookquote">``Well, I'm going,''  (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div>I told him (<font color='blue'><b>Parker</b></font>). I was far too big a coward to risk getting caught.
He (<font color='blue'><b>coward</b></font>) turned his (<font color='blue'><b>coward</b></font>) attention back to his (<font color='blue'><b>coward</b></font>) makeshift top. <div class="bookquote">``I'll see you later, then.''
 (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div>I hesitated, torn, but then the first bell sent me hurrying out the door  with a last glance confirming that
he (<font color='blue'><b>coward</b></font>) hadn't moved a centimeter.
As I half-ran to class, my head was spinning faster than the bottle cap. So few questions had been
answered in comparison to how many new questions had been raised. At least the rain had stopped.
I was lucky; Mr. Banner wasn't in the room yet when I arrived. I settled quickly into my seat, aware that
both Mike and Angela were staring at me. Mike looked resentful; Angela looked surprised, and slightly
awed.
Mr. Banner came in the room then, calling the class to order. He (<font color='blue'><b>Banner</b></font>) was juggling a few small cardboard
boxes in his (<font color='blue'><b>Banner</b></font>) arms. He (<font color='blue'><b>Banner</b></font>) put them down on Mike's table, telling him (<font color='blue'><b>Mike</b></font>) to start passing them around the class.
<div class="bookquote">``Okay, guys, I want you all to take one piece from each box,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Mike</b></font>) said as he (<font color='blue'><b>Mike</b></font>) produced a pair of rubber
gloves from the pocket of his (<font color='blue'><b>Mike</b></font>) lab jacket and pulled them on. The sharp sound as the gloves snapped into
place against his (<font color='blue'><b>Mike</b></font>) wrists seemed ominous to me. <div class="bookquote">``The first should be an indicator card,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Mike</b></font>) went on,
grabbing a white card with four squares marked on it and displaying it. <div class="bookquote">``The second is a four-pronged
applicator ''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Mike</b></font>) held up something that looked like a nearly toothless hair pick <div class="bookquote">'' and the third is a
sterile micro-lancet.''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>He (<font color='blue'><b>Mike</b></font>) held up a small piece of blue plastic and split it open. The barb was invisible
from this distance, but my stomach flipped.
<div class="bookquote">``I'll be coming around with a dropper of water to prepare your cards, so please don't start until I get to
you.''  (<font color='red'><b>He</b></font>)</div>He (<font color='blue'><b>Mike</b></font>) began at Mike's table again, carefully putting one drop of water in each of the four squares.
<div class="bookquote">``Then I want you to carefully prick your finger with the lancet''  (<font color='red'><b>He</b></font>)</div>He (<font color='blue'><b>Mike</b></font>) grabbed Mike's hand and jabbed
the spike into the tip of Mike's middle finger. Oh no. Clammy moisture broke out across my forehead.
<div class="bookquote">``Put a small drop of blood on each of the prongs.''  (<font color='red'><b>He</b></font>)</div>He (<font color='blue'><b>Mike</b></font>) demonstrated, squeezing Mike's finger till the

<p/>blood flowed. I swallowed convulsively, my stomach heaving.
<div class="bookquote">``And then apply it to the card,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Mike</b></font>) finished, holding up the dripping red card for us to see. I closed my
eyes, trying to hear through the ringing in my ears.
<div class="bookquote">``The Red Cross is having a blood drive in Port Angeles next weekend, so I thought you should all know
your blood type.''  (<font color='red'><b>He</b></font>)</div>He (<font color='blue'><b>Mike</b></font>) sounded proud of himself. <div class="bookquote">``Those of you who aren't eighteen yet will need a
parent's permission  I have slips at my desk.''
 (<font color='red'><b>He</b></font>)</div>He (<font color='blue'><b>Mike</b></font>) continued through the room with his (<font color='blue'><b>Mike</b></font>) water drops. I put my cheek against the cool black tabletop and
tried to hold on to my consciousness. All around me I could hear squeals, complaints, and giggles as my
classmates skewered their fingers. I breathed slowly in and out through my mouth.
<div class="bookquote">``Bella, are you all right?''  (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Banner</b></font>)</div>Mr. Banner asked. His (<font color='blue'><b>Banner</b></font>) voice was close to my head, and it sounded alarmed.
<div class="bookquote">``I already know my blood type, Mr. Banner,''  (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div>I said in a weak voice. I was afraid to raise my head.
<div class="bookquote">``Are you feeling faint?''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``Yes, sir,''  (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div>I muttered, internally kicking myself for not ditching when I had the chance.
<div class="bookquote">``Can someone take Bella to the nurse, please?''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Banner</b></font>) called.
I didn't have to look up to know that it would be Mike who volunteered.
<div class="bookquote">``Can you walk?''  (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Banner</b></font>)</div>Mr. Banner asked.
<div class="bookquote">``Yes,''  (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div>I whispered. Just let me get out of here, I thought. I'll crawl.
Mike seemed eager as he (<font color='blue'><b>Mike</b></font>) put his (<font color='blue'><b>Mike</b></font>) arm around my waist and pulled my arm over his (<font color='blue'><b>Mike</b></font>) shoulder. I leaned
against him (<font color='blue'><b>Mike</b></font>) heavily on the way out of the classroom.
Mike towed me slowly across campus. When we were around the edge of the cafeteria, out of sight of
building four in case Mr. Banner was watching, I stopped.
<div class="bookquote">``Just let me sit for a minute, please?''  (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div>I begged.
He (<font color='blue'><b>Banner</b></font>) helped me sit on the edge of the walk.
<div class="bookquote">``And whatever you do, keep your hand in your pocket,''  (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div>I warned. I was still so dizzy. I slumped over on
my side, putting my cheek against the freezing, damp cement of the sidewalk, closing my eyes. That
seemed to help a little.
<div class="bookquote">``Wow, you're green, Bella,''  (<font color='red'><b>Mike/Mike Newton/Newton</b></font>)</div>Mike said nervously.
<div class="bookquote">``Bella?''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>a different voice called from the distance.
No! Please let me be imagining that horribly familiar voice.
<div class="bookquote">``What's wrong  is she (<font color='blue'><b>Bella</b></font>) hurt?''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>His (<font color='blue'><b>Mike</b></font>) voice was closer now, and he (<font color='blue'><b>Mike</b></font>) sounded upset. I wasn't imagining it. I
squeezed my eyes shut, hoping to die. Or, at the very least, not to throw up.
Mike seemed stressed. <div class="bookquote">``I think she (<font color='blue'><b>Bella</b></font>)'s fainted. I don't know what happened, she (<font color='blue'><b>Bella</b></font>) didn't even stick her (<font color='blue'><b>Bella</b></font>)
finger.''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``Bella.''  (<font color='red'><b>Edward/Edward Cullen/Cullen</b></font>)</div>Edward's voice was right beside me, relieved now. <div class="bookquote">``Can you hear me?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``No,''  (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div>I groaned. <div class="bookquote">``Go away.''
 (<font color='red'><b>He</b></font>)</div>He (<font color='blue'><b>Mike</b></font>) chuckled.
<div class="bookquote">``I was taking her (<font color='blue'><b>Bella</b></font>) to the nurse,''  (<font color='red'><b>Mike/Mike Newton/Newton</b></font>)</div>Mike explained in a defensive tone, <div class="bookquote">``but she (<font color='blue'><b>Bella</b></font>) wouldn't go any farther.''
 (<font color='red'><b>Mike/Mike Newton/Newton</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``I'll take her (<font color='blue'><b>Bella</b></font>),''  (<font color='red'><b>Edward/Edward Cullen/Cullen</b></font>)</div>Edward said. I could hear the smile still in his (<font color='blue'><b>Edward</b></font>) voice. <div class="bookquote">``You can go back to class.''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``No,''  (<font color='red'><b>Mike/Mike Newton/Newton</b></font>)</div>Mike protested. <div class="bookquote">``I'm supposed to do it.''
 (<font color='red'><b>me</b></font>)</div>Suddenly the sidewalk disappeared from beneath me. My eyes flew open in shock. Edward had
scooped me up in his (<font color='blue'><b>Edward</b></font>) arms, as easily as if I weighed ten pounds instead of a hundred and ten.
<div class="bookquote">``Put me down!''  (<font color='red'><b>me</b></font>)</div>Please, please let me not vomit on him (<font color='blue'><b>Edward</b></font>). He (<font color='blue'><b>Edward</b></font>) was walking before I was finished talking.
<div class="bookquote">``Hey!''  (<font color='red'><b>Mike/Mike Newton/Newton</b></font>)</div>Mike called, already ten paces behind us.
Edward ignored him (<font color='blue'><b>Edward</b></font>). <div class="bookquote">``You look awful,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Edward</b></font>) told me, grinning.
<div class="bookquote">``Put me back on the sidewalk,''  (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div>I moaned. The rocking movement of his (<font color='blue'><b>Edward</b></font>) walk was not helping. He (<font color='blue'><b>Edward</b></font>) held
me away from his (<font color='blue'><b>Edward</b></font>) body, gingerly, supporting all my weight with just his (<font color='blue'><b>Edward</b></font>) arms  it didn't seem to bother
him (<font color='blue'><b>Edward</b></font>).
<div class="bookquote">``So you faint at the sight of blood?''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Edward</b></font>) asked. This seemed to entertain him (<font color='blue'><b>Edward</b></font>).
I didn't answer. I closed my eyes again and fought the nausea with all my strength, clamping my lips
together.
<div class="bookquote">``And not even your own blood,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Edward</b></font>) continued, enjoying himself.
I don't know how he (<font color='blue'><b>Edward</b></font>) opened the door while carrying me, but it was suddenly warm, so I knew we were
inside.
<div class="bookquote">``Oh my,''  (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div>I heard a female voice gasp.
<div class="bookquote">``She (<font color='blue'><b>Bella</b></font>) fainted in Biology,''  (<font color='red'><b>Edward/Edward Cullen/Cullen</b></font>)</div>Edward explained.
I opened my eyes. I was in the office, and Edward was striding past the front counter toward the nurse's
door. Ms. Cope, the redheaded front office receptionist, ran ahead of him (<font color='blue'><b>Edward</b></font>) to hold it open. The
grandmotherly nurse looked up from a novel, astonished, as Edward swung me into the room and placed
me gently on the crackly paper that covered the brown vinyl mattress on the one cot. Then he (<font color='blue'><b>Edward</b></font>) moved to
stand against the wall as far across the narrow room as possible. His (<font color='blue'><b>Edward</b></font>) eyes were bright, excited.
<div class="bookquote">``She (<font color='blue'><b>Bella</b></font>)'s just a little faint,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Edward</b></font>) reassured the startled nurse. <div class="bookquote">``They're blood typing in Biology.''
 (<font color='red'><b>The nurse</b></font>)</div>The nurse nodded sagely. <div class="bookquote">``There's always one.''
 (<font color='red'><b>He</b></font>)</div>He (<font color='blue'><b>Edward</b></font>) muffled a snicker.
<div class="bookquote">``Just lie down for a minute, honey; it'll pass.''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``I know,''  (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div>I sighed. The nausea was already fading.
<div class="bookquote">``Does this happen a lot?''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>nurse</b></font>) asked.
<div class="bookquote">``Sometimes,''  (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div>I admitted. Edward coughed to hide another laugh.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``You can go back to class now,''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>nurse</b></font>) told him (<font color='blue'><b>Edward</b></font>).
<div class="bookquote">``I'm supposed to stay with her (<font color='blue'><b>Bella</b></font>).''  (<font color='red'><b>He</b></font>)</div>He (<font color='blue'><b>Edward</b></font>) said this with such assured authority that  even though she (<font color='blue'><b>nurse</b></font>) pursed
her (<font color='blue'><b>nurse</b></font>) lips  the nurse didn't argue it further.
<div class="bookquote">``I'll go get you some ice for your forehead, dear,''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>nurse</b></font>) said to me, and then bustled out of the room.
<div class="bookquote">``You were right,''  (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div>I moaned, letting my eyes close.
<div class="bookquote">``I usually am  but about what in particular this time?''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``Ditching is healthy.''  (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div>I practiced breathing evenly.
<div class="bookquote">``You scared me for a minute there,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Edward</b></font>) admitted after a pause. His (<font color='blue'><b>Edward</b></font>) tone made it sound like he (<font color='blue'><b>Edward</b></font>) was
confessing a humiliating weakness. <div class="bookquote">``I thought Newton was dragging your dead body off to bury it in the
woods.''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``Ha ha.''  (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div>I still had my eyes closed, but I was feeling more normal every minute.
<div class="bookquote">``Honestly  I've seen corpses with better color. I was concerned that I might have to avenge your
murder.''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``Poor Mike. I'll bet he (<font color='blue'><b>Mike</b></font>)'s mad.''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``He (<font color='blue'><b>Mike</b></font>) absolutely loathes me,''  (<font color='red'><b>Edward/Edward Cullen/Cullen</b></font>)</div>Edward said cheerfully.
<div class="bookquote">``You can't know that,''  (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div>I argued, but then I wondered suddenly if he (<font color='blue'><b>Edward</b></font>) could.
<div class="bookquote">``I saw his (<font color='blue'><b>Mike</b></font>) face  I could tell.''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``How did you see me? I thought you were ditching.''  (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div>I was almost fine now, though the queasiness would
probably pass faster if I'd eaten something for lunch. On the other hand, maybe it was lucky my stomach
was empty.
<div class="bookquote">``I was in my car, listening to a CD.''  (<font color='red'><b>me</b></font>)</div>Such a normal response  it surprised me.
I heard the door and opened my eyes to see the nurse with a cold compress in her (<font color='blue'><b>nurse</b></font>) hand.
<div class="bookquote">``Here you go, dear.''  (<font color='red'><b>She</b></font>)</div>She (<font color='blue'><b>nurse</b></font>) laid it across my forehead. <div class="bookquote">``You're looking better,''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>nurse</b></font>) added.
<div class="bookquote">``I think I'm fine,''  (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div>I said, sitting up. Just a little ringing in my ears, no spinning. The mint green walls stayed
where they should.
I could see she (<font color='blue'><b>nurse</b></font>) was about to make me lie back down, but the door opened just then, and Ms. Cope
stuck her (<font color='blue'><b>Cope</b></font>) head in.
<div class="bookquote">``We've got another one,''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Cope</b></font>) warned.
I hopped down to free up the cot for the next invalid.
I handed the compress back to the nurse. <div class="bookquote">``Here, I don't need this.''
 (<font color='red'><b>Mike/Mike Newton/Newton</b></font>)</div>And then Mike staggered through the door, now supporting a sallow-looking Lee Stephens, another boy
in our Biology class. Edward and I drew back against the wall to give them room.
<div class="bookquote">``Oh no,''  (<font color='red'><b>Edward/Edward Cullen/Cullen</b></font>)</div>Edward muttered. <div class="bookquote">``Go out to the office, Bella.''

 (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div><p/>I looked up at him (<font color='blue'><b>Edward</b></font>), bewildered.
<div class="bookquote">``Trust me  go.''
 (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div>I spun and caught the door before it closed, darting out of the infirmary. I could feel Edward right behind
me.
<div class="bookquote">``You actually listened to me.''  (<font color='red'><b>He</b></font>)</div>He (<font color='blue'><b>Edward</b></font>) was stunned.
<div class="bookquote">``I smelled the blood,''  (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div>I said, wrinkling my nose. Lee wasn't sick from watching other people, like me.
<div class="bookquote">``People can't smell blood,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Lee</b></font>) contradicted.
<div class="bookquote">``Well, I can  that's what makes me sick. It smells like rust and salt.''
 (<font color='red'><b>He</b></font>)</div>He (<font color='blue'><b>Lee</b></font>) was staring at me with an unfathomable expression.
<div class="bookquote">``What?''  (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div>I asked.
<div class="bookquote">``It's nothing.''
 (<font color='red'><b>Mike/Mike Newton/Newton</b></font>)</div>Mike came through the door then, glancing from me to Edward. The look he (<font color='blue'><b>Edward</b></font>) gave Edward confirmed
what Edward had said about loathing. He (<font color='blue'><b>Edward</b></font>) looked back at me, his (<font color='blue'><b>Edward</b></font>) eyes glum.
<div class="bookquote">``You look better,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Edward</b></font>) accused.
<div class="bookquote">``Just keep your hand in your pocket,''  (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div>I warned him (<font color='blue'><b>Edward</b></font>) again.
<div class="bookquote">``It's not bleeding anymore,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Edward</b></font>) muttered. <div class="bookquote">``Are you going back to class?''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``Are you kidding? I'd just have to turn around and come back.''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``Yeah, I guess So are you going this weekend? To the beach?''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>While he (<font color='blue'><b>Edward</b></font>) spoke, he (<font color='blue'><b>Edward</b></font>) flashed another
glare toward Edward, who was standing against the cluttered counter, motionless as a sculpture, staring
off into space.
I tried to sound as friendly as possible. <div class="bookquote">``Sure, I said I was in.''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``We're meeting at my dad's store, at ten.''  (<font color='red'><b>Edward/Edward Cullen/Cullen</b></font>)</div>His (<font color='blue'><b>Edward</b></font>) eyes flickered to Edward again, wondering if he (<font color='blue'><b>Edward</b></font>) was giving
out too much information. His (<font color='blue'><b>Edward</b></font>) body language made it clear that it wasn't an open invitation.
<div class="bookquote">``I'll be there,''  (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div>I promised.
<div class="bookquote">``I'll see you in Gym, then,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Edward</b></font>) said, moving uncertainly toward the door.
<div class="bookquote">``See you,''  (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div>I replied. He (<font color='blue'><b>Edward</b></font>) looked at me once more, his (<font color='blue'><b>Edward</b></font>) round face slightly pouting, and then as he (<font color='blue'><b>Edward</b></font>) walked
slowly through the door, his (<font color='blue'><b>Edward</b></font>) shoulders slumped. A swell of sympathy washed over me. I pondered seeing
his (<font color='blue'><b>Edward</b></font>) disappointed face again in Gym.
<div class="bookquote">``Gym,''  (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div>I groaned.
<div class="bookquote">``I can take care of that.''  (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div>I hadn't noticed Edward moving to my side, but he (<font color='blue'><b>Edward</b></font>) spoke now in my ear. <div class="bookquote">``Go
sit down and look pale,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Edward</b></font>) muttered.
That wasn't a challenge; I was always pale, and my recent swoon had left a light sheen of sweat on my
face. I sat in one of the creaky folding chairs and rested my head against the wall with my eyes closed.

<p/>Fainting spells always exhausted me.
I heard Edward speaking softly at the counter.
<div class="bookquote">``Ms. Cope?''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``Yes?''  (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div>I hadn't heard her (<font color='blue'><b>I</b></font>) return to her (<font color='blue'><b>I</b></font>) desk.
<div class="bookquote">``Bella has Gym next hour, and I don't think she (<font color='blue'><b>Bella</b></font>) feels well enough. Actually, I was thinking I should take
her (<font color='blue'><b>Bella</b></font>) home now. Do you think you could excuse her (<font color='blue'><b>Bella</b></font>) from class?''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>His (<font color='blue'><b>Edward</b></font>) voice was like melting honey. I could
imagine how much more overwhelming his (<font color='blue'><b>Edward</b></font>) eyes would be.
<div class="bookquote">``Do you need to be excused, too, Edward?''  (<font color='red'><b>Ms. Cope</b></font>)</div>Ms. Cope fluttered. Why couldn't I do that?
<div class="bookquote">``No, I have Mrs. Goff, she (<font color='blue'><b>Goff</b></font>) won't mind.''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``Okay, it's all taken care of. You feel better, Bella,''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Cope</b></font>) called to me. I nodded weakly, hamming it up
just a bit.
<div class="bookquote">``Can you walk, or do you want me to carry you again?''  (<font color='red'><b>the receptionist</b></font>)</div>With his (<font color='blue'><b>Edward</b></font>) back to the receptionist, his (<font color='blue'><b>Edward</b></font>) expression
became sarcastic.
<div class="bookquote">``I'll walk.''
 (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div>I stood carefully, and I was still fine. He (<font color='blue'><b>Edward</b></font>) held the door for me, his (<font color='blue'><b>Edward</b></font>) smile polite but his (<font color='blue'><b>Edward</b></font>) eyes mocking. I
walked out into the cold, fine mist that had just begun to fall. It felt nice  the first time I'd enjoyed the
constant moisture falling out of the sky  as it washed my face clean of the sticky perspiration.
<div class="bookquote">``Thanks,''  (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div>I said as he (<font color='blue'><b>Edward</b></font>) followed me out. <div class="bookquote">``It's almost worth getting sick to miss Gym.''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``Anytime.''  (<font color='red'><b>He</b></font>)</div>He (<font color='blue'><b>Edward</b></font>) was staring straight forward, squinting into the rain.
<div class="bookquote">``So are you going? This Saturday, I mean?''  (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div>I was hoping he (<font color='blue'><b>Edward</b></font>) would, though it seemed unlikely. I couldn't
picture him (<font color='blue'><b>Edward</b></font>) loading up to carpool with the rest of the kids from school; he (<font color='blue'><b>Edward</b></font>) didn't belong in the same
world. But just hoping that he (<font color='blue'><b>Edward</b></font>) might gave me the first twinge of enthusiasm I'd felt for the outing.
<div class="bookquote">``Where are you all going, exactly?''  (<font color='red'><b>He</b></font>)</div>He (<font color='blue'><b>Edward</b></font>) was still looking ahead, expressionless.
<div class="bookquote">``Down to La Push, to First Beach.''  (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div>I studied his (<font color='blue'><b>Edward</b></font>) face, trying to read it. His (<font color='blue'><b>Edward</b></font>) eyes seemed to narrow
infinitesimally.
He (<font color='blue'><b>Edward</b></font>) glanced down at me from the corner of his (<font color='blue'><b>Edward</b></font>) eye, smiling wryly. <div class="bookquote">``I really don't think I was invited.''
 (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div>I sighed. <div class="bookquote">``I just invited you.''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``Let's you and I not push poor Mike any further this week. We don't want him (<font color='blue'><b>Mike</b></font>) to snap.''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>His (<font color='blue'><b>Edward</b></font>) eyes
danced; he (<font color='blue'><b>Edward</b></font>) was enjoying the idea more than he (<font color='blue'><b>Edward</b></font>) should.
<div class="bookquote">``Mike-schmike.''  (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div>I muttered, preoccupied by the way he (<font color='blue'><b>Edward</b></font>)'d said <div class="bookquote">``you and I.''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>I liked it more than I should.
We were near the parking lot now. I veered left, toward my truck. Something caught my jacket, yanking
me back.
<div class="bookquote">``Where do you think you're going?''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Edward</b></font>) asked, outraged. He (<font color='blue'><b>Edward</b></font>) was gripping a fistful of my jacket in one
hand.

<p/>I was confused. <div class="bookquote">``I'm going home.''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``Didn't you hear me promise to take you safely home? Do you think I'm going to let you drive in your
condition?''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>His (<font color='blue'><b>Edward</b></font>) voice was still indignant.
<div class="bookquote">``What condition? And what about my truck?''  (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div>I complained.
<div class="bookquote">``I'll have Alice drop it off after school.''  (<font color='red'><b>He</b></font>)</div>He (<font color='blue'><b>Edward</b></font>) was towing me toward his (<font color='blue'><b>Edward</b></font>) car now, pulling me by my jacket.
It was all I could do to keep from falling backward. He (<font color='blue'><b>Edward</b></font>)'d probably just drag me along anyway if I did.
<div class="bookquote">``Let go!''  (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div>I insisted. He (<font color='blue'><b>Edward</b></font>) ignored me. I staggered along sideways across the wet sidewalk until we reached
the Volvo. Then he (<font color='blue'><b>Edward</b></font>) finally freed me  I stumbled against the passenger door.
<div class="bookquote">``You are so pushy!''  (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div>I grumbled.
<div class="bookquote">``It's open,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>was all he (<font color='blue'><b>Edward</b></font>) responded. He (<font color='blue'><b>Edward</b></font>) got in the driver's side.
<div class="bookquote">``I am perfectly capable of driving myself home!''  (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div>I stood by the car, fuming. It was raining harder now,
and I'd never put my hood up, so my hair was dripping down my back.
He (<font color='blue'><b>Edward</b></font>) lowered the automatic window and leaned toward me across the seat. <div class="bookquote">``Get in, Bella.''
 (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div>I didn't answer. I was mentally calculating my chances of reaching the truck before he (<font color='blue'><b>Edward</b></font>) could catch me. I
had to admit, they weren't good.
<div class="bookquote">``I'll just drag you back,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Edward</b></font>) threatened, guessing my plan.
I tried to maintain what dignity I could as I got into his (<font color='blue'><b>Edward</b></font>) car. I wasn't very successful  I looked like a
half-drowned cat and my boots squeaked.
<div class="bookquote">``This is completely unnecessary,''  (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div>I said stiffly.
He (<font color='blue'><b>Edward</b></font>) didn't answer. He (<font color='blue'><b>Edward</b></font>) fiddled with the controls, turning the heater up and the music down. As he (<font color='blue'><b>Edward</b></font>) pulled
out of the parking lot, I was preparing to give him (<font color='blue'><b>Edward</b></font>) the silent treatment  my face in full pout mode  but
then I recognized the music playing, and my curiosity got the better of my intentions.
<div class="bookquote">``Clair de Lune?''  (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div>I asked, surprised.
<div class="bookquote">``You know Debussy?''  (<font color='red'><b>He</b></font>)</div>He (<font color='blue'><b>Edward</b></font>) sounded surprised, too.
<div class="bookquote">``Not well,''  (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div>I admitted. <div class="bookquote">``My mother plays a lot of classical music around the house  I only know my
favorites.''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``It's one of my favorites, too.''  (<font color='red'><b>He</b></font>)</div>He (<font color='blue'><b>Edward</b></font>) stared out through the rain, lost in thought.
I listened to the music, relaxing against the light gray leather seat. It was impossible not to respond to the
familiar, soothing melody. The rain blurred everything outside the window into gray and green smudges. I
began to realize we were driving very fast; the car moved so steadily, so evenly, though, I didn't feel the
speed. Only the town flashing by gave it away.
<div class="bookquote">``What is your mother like?''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Edward</b></font>) asked me suddenly.
I glanced over to see him (<font color='blue'><b>Edward</b></font>) studying me with curious eyes.
<div class="bookquote">``She (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) looks a lot like me, but she (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>)'s prettier,''  (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div>I said. He (<font color='blue'><b>Edward</b></font>) raised his (<font color='blue'><b>Edward</b></font>) eyebrows. ``I have too much Charlie in

<p/>me. She (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>)'s more outgoing than I am, and braver. She (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>)'s irresponsible and slightly eccentric, and she (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>)'s a
very unpredictable cook. She (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>)'s my best friend.'' I stopped. Talking about her (<font color='blue'><b>we</b></font>) was making me depressed.
``How old are you, Bella?'' His (<font color='blue'><b>Edward</b></font>) voice sounded frustrated for some reason I couldn't imagine. He (<font color='blue'><b>Edward</b></font>)'d
stopped the car, and I realized we were at Charlie's house already. The rain was so heavy that I could
barely see the house at all. It was like the car was submerged under a river.
``I'm seventeen,'' I responded, a little confused.
``You don't seem seventeen.''
His (<font color='blue'><b>Charlie</b></font>) tone was reproachful; it made me laugh.
``What?'' he (<font color='blue'><b>Charlie</b></font>) asked, curious again.
``My mom always says I was born thirty-five years old and that I get more middle-aged every year.'' I
laughed, and then sighed. ``Well, someone has to be the adult.'' I paused for a second. ``You don't seem
much like a junior in high school yourself,'' I noted.
He (<font color='blue'><b>Charlie</b></font>) made a face and changed the subject.
``So why did your mother marry Phil?''
I was surprised he (<font color='blue'><b>Charlie</b></font>) would remember the name; I'd mentioned it just once, almost two months ago. It took
me a moment to answer.
``My mother she (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>)'s very young for her (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) age. I think Phil makes her (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) feel even younger. At any rate, she (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>)'s
crazy about him (<font color='blue'><b>Phil</b></font>).'' I shook my head. The attraction was a mystery to me.
``Do you approve?'' he (<font color='blue'><b>Charlie</b></font>) asked.
``Does it matter?'' I countered. ``I want her (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) to be happy and he (<font color='blue'><b>Phil</b></font>) is who she (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) wants.''
``That's very generous I wonder,'' he (<font color='blue'><b>Charlie</b></font>) mused.
``What?''
``Would she (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) extend the same courtesy to you, do you think? No matter who your choice was?'' He (<font color='blue'><b>Charlie</b></font>) was
suddenly intent, his (<font color='blue'><b>Charlie</b></font>) eyes searching mine.
``I-I think so,'' I stuttered. ``But she (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>)'s the parent, after all. It's a little bit different.''
``No one too scary then,'' he (<font color='blue'><b>Charlie</b></font>) teased.
I grinned in response. ``What do you mean by scary? Multiple facial piercings and extensive tattoos?''
``That's one definition, I suppose.''
``What's your definition?''
But he (<font color='blue'><b>Charlie</b></font>) ignored my question and asked me another. ``Do you think that I could be scary?'' He (<font color='blue'><b>Charlie</b></font>) raised one
eyebrow, and the faint trace of a smile lightened his (<font color='blue'><b>Charlie</b></font>) face.
I thought for a moment, wondering whether the truth or a lie would go over better. I decided to go with
the truth. <div class="bookquote">``Hmmm I think you could be, if you wanted to.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Are you frightened of me now?''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>The smile vanished, and his (<font color='blue'><b>Charlie</b></font>) heavenly face was suddenly serious.
<div class="bookquote">``No.''  (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div>But I answered too quickly. The smile returned.
<div class="bookquote">``So, now are you going to tell me about your family?''  (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div>I asked to distract him (<font color='blue'><b>Charlie</b></font>). <div class="bookquote">``It's got to be a much more
interesting story than mine.''
 (<font color='red'><b>He</b></font>)</div>He (<font color='blue'><b>Charlie</b></font>) was instantly cautious. <div class="bookquote">``What do you want to know?''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``The Cullens adopted you?''  (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div>I verified.
<div class="bookquote">``Yes.''
 (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div>I hesitated for a moment. <div class="bookquote">``What happened to your parents?''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``They died many years ago.''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>His (<font color='blue'><b>Charlie</b></font>) tone was matter-of-fact.
<div class="bookquote">``I'm sorry,''  (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div>I mumbled.
<div class="bookquote">``I don't really remember them that clearly. Carlisle and Esme have been my parents for a long time now.''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``And you love them.''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>It wasn't a question. It was obvious in the way he (<font color='blue'><b>Charlie</b></font>) spoke of them.
<div class="bookquote">``Yes.''  (<font color='red'><b>He</b></font>)</div>He (<font color='blue'><b>Charlie</b></font>) smiled. <div class="bookquote">``I couldn't imagine two better people.''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``You're very lucky.''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``I know I am.''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``And your brother and sister?''
 (<font color='red'><b>He</b></font>)</div>He (<font color='blue'><b>Charlie</b></font>) glanced at the clock on the dashboard.
<div class="bookquote">``My brother and sister, and Jasper and Rosalie for that matter, are going to be quite upset if they have to
stand in the rain waiting for me.''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``Oh, sorry, I guess you have to go.''  (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div>I didn't want to get out of the car.
<div class="bookquote">``And you probably want your truck back before Chief Swan gets home, so you don't have to tell him (<font color='blue'><b>Chief</b></font>)
about the Biology incident.''  (<font color='red'><b>He</b></font>)</div>He (<font color='blue'><b>Charlie</b></font>) grinned at me.
<div class="bookquote">``I'm sure he (<font color='blue'><b>Chief</b></font>)'s already heard. There are no secrets in Forks.''  (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div>I sighed.
He (<font color='blue'><b>Charlie</b></font>) laughed, and there was an edge to his (<font color='blue'><b>Charlie</b></font>) laughter.
<div class="bookquote">``Have fun at the beach good weather for sunbathing.''  (<font color='red'><b>He</b></font>)</div>He (<font color='blue'><b>Charlie</b></font>) glanced out at the sheeting rain.
<div class="bookquote">``Won't I see you tomorrow?''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``No. Emmett and I are starting the weekend early.''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``What are you going to do?''  (<font color='red'><b>A friend</b></font>)</div>A friend could ask that, right? I hoped the disappointment wasn't too
apparent in my voice.
<div class="bookquote">``We're going to be hiking in the Goat Rocks Wilderness, just south of Rainier.''
 (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div>I remembered Charlie had said the Cullens went camping frequently.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Oh, well, have fun.''  (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div>I tried to sound enthusiastic. I don't think I fooled him (<font color='blue'><b>Charlie</b></font>), though. A smile was playing
around the edges of his (<font color='blue'><b>Charlie</b></font>) lips.
<div class="bookquote">``Will you do something for me this weekend?''  (<font color='red'><b>He</b></font>)</div>He (<font color='blue'><b>Charlie</b></font>) turned to look me straight in the face, utilizing the full
power of his (<font color='blue'><b>Charlie</b></font>) burning gold eyes.
I nodded helplessly.
<div class="bookquote">``Don't be offended, but you seem to be one of those people who just attract accidents like a magnet.
So try not to fall into the ocean or get run over or anything, all right?''  (<font color='red'><b>He</b></font>)</div>He (<font color='blue'><b>Charlie</b></font>) smiled crookedly.
The helplessness had faded as he (<font color='blue'><b>Charlie</b></font>) spoke. I glared at him (<font color='blue'><b>Charlie</b></font>).
<div class="bookquote">``I'll see what I can do,''  (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div>I snapped as I jumped out into the rain. I slammed the door behind me with
excessive force.
He (<font color='blue'><b>Charlie</b></font>) was still smiling as he (<font color='blue'><b>Charlie</b></font>) drove away.

<p/>6. SCARY STORIES

<p/>As I sat in my room, trying to concentrate on the third act of Macbeth, I was really listening for my truck.
I would have thought, even over the pounding rain, I could have heard the engine's roar. But when I went
to peek out the curtain  again  it was suddenly there.
I wasn't looking forward to Friday, and it more than lived up to my non-expectations. Of course there
were the fainting comments. Jessica especially seemed to get a kick out of that story. Luckily Mike had
kept his (<font color='blue'><b>Mike</b></font>) mouth shut, and no one seemed to know about Edward's involvement. She (<font color='blue'><b>Jessica</b></font>) did have a lot of
questions about lunch, though.
<div class="bookquote">``So what did Edward Cullen want yesterday?''  (<font color='red'><b>Jessica</b></font>)</div>Jessica asked in Trig.
<div class="bookquote">``I don't know,''  (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div>I answered truthfully. <div class="bookquote">``He (<font color='blue'><b>Cullen</b></font>) never really got to the point.''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``You looked kind of mad,''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Jessica</b></font>) fished.
<div class="bookquote">``Did I?''  (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div>I kept my expression blank.
<div class="bookquote">``You know, I've never seen him (<font color='blue'><b>Cullen</b></font>) sit with anyone but his (<font color='blue'><b>Cullen</b></font>) family before. That was weird.''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``Weird,''  (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div>I agreed. She (<font color='blue'><b>Jessica</b></font>) seemed annoyed; she (<font color='blue'><b>Jessica</b></font>) flipped her (<font color='blue'><b>Jessica</b></font>) dark curls impatiently  I guessed she (<font color='blue'><b>Jessica</b></font>)'d been
hoping to hear something that would make a good story for her (<font color='blue'><b>Jessica</b></font>) to pass on.
The worst part about Friday was that, even though I knew he (<font color='blue'><b>Edward</b></font>) wasn't going to be there, I still hoped.
When I walked into the cafeteria with Jessica and Mike, I couldn't keep from looking at his (<font color='blue'><b>Mike</b></font>) table, where
Rosalie, Alice, and Jasper sat talking, heads close together. And I couldn't stop the gloom that engulfed
me as I realized I didn't know how long I would have to wait before I saw him (<font color='blue'><b>Jasper</b></font>) again.
At my usual table, everyone was full of our plans for the next day. Mike was animated again, putting a
great deal of trust in the local weatherman who promised sun tomorrow. I'd have to see that before I
believed it. But it was warmer today  almost sixty. Maybe the outing wouldn't be completely
miserable.

<p/>I intercepted a few unfriendly glances from Lauren during lunch, which I didn't understand until we were
all walking out of the room together. I was right behind her (<font color='blue'><b>Lauren</b></font>), just a foot from her (<font color='blue'><b>Lauren</b></font>) slick, silver blond hair,
and she (<font color='blue'><b>Lauren</b></font>) was evidently unaware of that.
<div class="bookquote">''don't know why Bella''   (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Bella</b></font>) sneered my name  <div class="bookquote">``doesn't just sit with the Cullens from now on.''
 (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>I heard her (<font color='blue'><b>Bella</b></font>) muttering to Mike. I'd never noticed what an unpleasant, nasal voice she (<font color='blue'><b>Bella</b></font>) had, and I was
surprised by the malice in it. I really didn't know her (<font color='blue'><b>Bella</b></font>) well at all, certainly not well enough for her (<font color='blue'><b>Bella</b></font>) to dislike
me  or so I'd thought. <div class="bookquote">``She (<font color='blue'><b>You</b></font>)'s my friend; she (<font color='blue'><b>You</b></font>) sits with us,''  (<font color='red'><b>Mike/Mike Newton/Newton</b></font>)</div>Mike whispered back loyally, but also a bit
territorially. I paused to let Jess and Angela pass me. I didn't want to hear any more.

<p/>That night at dinner, Charlie seemed enthusiastic about my trip to La Push in the morning. I think he (<font color='blue'><b>Charlie</b></font>) felt
guilty for leaving me home alone on the weekends, but he (<font color='blue'><b>Charlie</b></font>)'d spent too many years building his (<font color='blue'><b>Charlie</b></font>) habits to
break them now. Of course he (<font color='blue'><b>Charlie</b></font>) knew the names of all the kids going, and their parents, and their
great-grandparents, too, probably. He (<font color='blue'><b>Charlie</b></font>) seemed to approve. I wondered if he (<font color='blue'><b>Charlie</b></font>) would approve of my plan
to ride to Seattle with Edward Cullen. Not that I was going to tell him (<font color='blue'><b>Cullen</b></font>).
<div class="bookquote">``Dad, do you know a place called Goat Rocks or something like that? I think it's south of Mount
Rainier,''  (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div>I asked casually.
<div class="bookquote">``Yeah  why?''
 (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div>I shrugged. <div class="bookquote">``Some kids were talking about camping there.''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``It's not a very good place for camping.''  (<font color='red'><b>He</b></font>)</div>He (<font color='blue'><b>Cullen</b></font>) sounded surprised. <div class="bookquote">``Too many bears. Most people go there
during the hunting season.''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``Oh,''  (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div>I murmured. <div class="bookquote">``Maybe I got the name wrong.''
 (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div>I meant to sleep in, but an unusual brightness woke me. I opened my eyes to see a clear yellow light
streaming through my window. I couldn't believe it. I hurried to the window to check, and sure enough,
there was the sun. It was in the wrong place in the sky, too low, and it didn't seem to be as close as it
should be, but it was definitely the sun. Clouds ringed the horizon, but a large patch of blue was visible in
the middle. I lingered by the window as long as I could, afraid that if I left the blue would disappear
again.
The Newtons' Olympic Outfitters store was just north of town. I'd seen the store, but I'd never stopped
there  not having much need for any supplies required for being outdoors over an extended period of
time. In the parking lot I recognized Mike's Suburban and Tyler's Sentra. As I pulled up next to their
vehicles, I could see the group standing around in front of the Suburban. Eric was there, along with two
other boys I had class with; I was fairly sure their names were Ben and Conner. Jess was there, flanked
by Angela and Lauren. Three other girls stood with them, including one I remembered falling over in Gym
on Friday. That one gave me a dirty look as I got out of the truck, and whispered something to Lauren.
Lauren shook out her (<font color='blue'><b>Lauren</b></font>) cornsilk hair and eyed me scornfully.
So it was going to be one of those days.
At least Mike was happy to see me.
<div class="bookquote">``You came!''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Mike</b></font>) called, delighted. <div class="bookquote">``And I said it would be sunny today, didn't I?''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``I told you I was coming,''  (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div>I reminded him (<font color='blue'><b>Mike</b></font>).

<p/><div class="bookquote">``We're just waiting for Lee and Samantha unless you invited someone,''  (<font color='red'><b>Mike/Mike Newton/Newton</b></font>)</div>Mike added.
<div class="bookquote">``Nope,''  (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div>I lied lightly, hoping I wouldn't get caught in the lie. But also wishing that a miracle would occur,
and Edward would appear.
Mike looked satisfied.
<div class="bookquote">``Will you ride in my car? It's that or Lee's mom's minivan.''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``Sure.''
 (<font color='red'><b>He</b></font>)</div>He (<font color='blue'><b>Mike</b></font>) smiled blissfully. It was so easy to make Mike happy.
<div class="bookquote">``You can have shotgun,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Mike</b></font>) promised. I hid my chagrin. It wasn't as simple to make Mike and Jessica
happy at the same time. I could see Jessica glowering at us now.
The numbers worked out in my favor, though. Lee brought two extra people, and suddenly every seat
was necessary. I managed to wedge Jess in between Mike and me in the front seat of the Suburban.
Mike could have been more graceful about it, but at least Jess seemed appeased.
It was only fifteen miles to La Push from Forks, with gorgeous, dense green forests edging the road most
of the way and the wide Quillayute River snaking beneath it twice. I was glad I had the window seat.
We'd rolled the windows down  the Suburban was a bit claustrophobic with nine people in it  and I
tried to absorb as much sunlight as possible.
I'd been to the beaches around La Push many times during my Forks summers with Charlie, so the
mile-long crescent of First Beach was familiar to me. It was still breathtaking. The water was dark gray,
even in the sunlight, white-capped and heaving to the gray, rocky shore. Islands rose out of the steel
harbor waters with sheer cliff sides, reaching to uneven summits, and crowned with austere, soaring firs.
The beach had only a thin border of actual sand at the water's edge, after which it grew into millions of
large, smooth stones that looked uniformly gray from a distance, but close up were every shade a stone
could be: terra-cotta, sea green, lavender, blue gray, dull gold. The tide line was strewn with huge
driftwood trees, bleached bone white in the salt waves, some piled together against the edge of the forest
fringe, some lying solitary, just out of reach of the waves.
There was a brisk wind coming off the waves, cool and briny. Pelicans floated on the swells while
seagulls and a lone eagle wheeled above them. The clouds still circled the sky, threatening to invade at
any moment, but for now the sun shone bravely in its halo of blue sky.
We picked our way down to the beach, Mike leading the way to a ring of driftwood logs that had
obviously been used for parties like ours before. There was a fire circle already in place, filled with black
ashes. Eric and the boy I thought was named Ben gathered broken branches of driftwood from the drier
piles against the forest edge, and soon had a teepee-shaped construction built atop the old cinders.
<div class="bookquote">``Have you ever seen a driftwood fire?''  (<font color='red'><b>Mike/Mike Newton/Newton</b></font>)</div>Mike asked me. I was sitting on one of the bone-colored
benches; the other girls clustered, gossiping excitedly, on either side of me. Mike kneeled by the fire,
lighting one of the smaller sticks with a cigarette lighter.
<div class="bookquote">``No,''  (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div>I said as he (<font color='blue'><b>Mike</b></font>) placed the blazing twig carefully against the teepee.
<div class="bookquote">``You'll like this then  watch the colors.''  (<font color='red'><b>He</b></font>)</div>He (<font color='blue'><b>Mike</b></font>) lit another small branch and laid it alongside the first. The
flames started to lick quickly up the dry wood.
<div class="bookquote">``It's blue,''  (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div>I said in surprise.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``The salt does it. Pretty, isn't it?''  (<font color='red'><b>He</b></font>)</div>He (<font color='blue'><b>Mike</b></font>) lit one more piece, placed it where the fire hadn't yet caught, and
then came to sit by me. Thankfully, Jess was on his (<font color='blue'><b>Mike</b></font>) other side. She (<font color='blue'><b>Jess</b></font>) turned to him (<font color='blue'><b>Mike</b></font>) and claimed his (<font color='blue'><b>Mike</b></font>)
attention. I watched the strange blue and green flames crackle toward the sky.
After a half hour of chatter, some of the boys wanted to hike to the nearby tidal pools. It was a dilemma.
On the one hand, I loved the tide pools. They had fascinated me since I was a child; they were one of the
only things I ever looked forward to when I had to come to Forks. On the other hand, I'd also fallen into
them a lot. Not a big deal when you're seven and with your dad. It reminded me of Edward's request 
that I not fall into the ocean.
Lauren was the one who made my decision for me. She (<font color='blue'><b>Lauren</b></font>) didn't want to hike, and she (<font color='blue'><b>Lauren</b></font>) was definitely
wearing the wrong shoes for it. Most of the other girls besides Angela and Jessica decided to stay on the
beach as well. I waited until Tyler and Eric had committed to remaining with them before I got up quietly
to join the pro-hiking group. Mike gave me a huge smile when he (<font color='blue'><b>Mike</b></font>) saw that I was coming.
The hike wasn't too long, though I hated to lose the sky in the woods. The green light of the forest was
strangely at odds with the adolescent laughter, too murky and ominous to be in harmony with the light
banter around me. I had to watch each step I took very carefully, avoiding roots below and branches
above, and I soon fell behind. Eventually I broke through the emerald confines of the forest and found the
rocky shore again. It was low tide, and a tidal river flowed past us on its way to the sea. Along its
pebbled banks, shallow pools that never completely drained were teeming with life.
I was very cautious not to lean too far over the little ocean ponds. The others were fearless, leaping over
the rocks, perching precariously on the edges. I found a very stable-looking rock on the fringe of one of
the largest pools and sat there cautiously, spellbound by the natural aquarium below me. The bouquets of
brilliant anemones undulated ceaselessly in the invisible current, twisted shells scurried about the edges,
obscuring the crabs within them, starfish stuck motionless to the rocks and each other, while one small
black eel with white racing stripes wove through the bright green weeds, waiting for the sea to return. I
was completely absorbed, except for one small part of my mind that wondered what Edward was doing
now, and trying to imagine what he (<font color='blue'><b>Edward</b></font>) would be saying if he (<font color='blue'><b>Edward</b></font>) were here with me.
Finally the boys were hungry, and I got up stiffly to follow them back. I tried to keep up better this time
through the woods, so naturally I fell a few times. I got some shallow scrapes on my palms, and the
knees of my jeans were stained green, but it could have been worse.
When we got back to First Beach, the group we'd left behind had multiplied. As we got closer we could
see the shining, straight black hair and copper skin of the newcomers, teenagers from the reservation
come to socialize.
The food was already being passed around, and the boys hurried to claim a share while Eric introduced
us as we each entered the driftwood circle. Angela and I were the last to arrive, and, as Eric said our
names, I noticed a younger boy sitting on the stones near the fire glance up at me in interest. I sat down
next to Angela, and Mike brought us sandwiches and an array of sodas to choose from, while a boy who
looked to be the oldest of the visitors rattled off the names of the seven others with him (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>). All I caught was
that one of the girls was also named Jessica, and the boy who noticed me was named Jacob.
It was relaxing to sit with Angela; she (<font color='blue'><b>Angela</b></font>) was a restful kind of person to be around  she (<font color='blue'><b>Angela</b></font>) didn't feel the
need to fill every silence with chatter. She (<font color='blue'><b>Angela</b></font>) left me free to think undisturbed while we ate. And I was
thinking about how disjointedly time seemed to flow in Forks, passing in a blur at times, with single
images standing out more clearly than others. And then, at other times, every second was significant,
etched in my mind. I knew exactly what caused the difference, and it disturbed me.

<p/>During lunch the clouds started to advance, slinking across the blue sky, darting in front of the sun
momentarily, casting long shadows across the beach, and blackening the waves. As they finished eating,
people started to drift away in twos and threes. Some walked down to the edge of the waves, trying to
skip rocks across the choppy surface. Others were gathering a second expedition to the tide pools. Mike
 with Jessica shadowing him (<font color='blue'><b>Mike</b></font>)  headed up to the one shop in the village. Some of the local kids went
with them; others went along on the hike. By the time they all had scattered, I was sitting alone on my
driftwood log, with Lauren and Tyler occupying themselves by the CD player someone had thought to
bring, and three teenagers from the reservation perched around the circle, including the boy named Jacob
and the oldest boy who had acted as spokesperson.
A few minutes after Angela left with the hikers, Jacob sauntered over to take her (<font color='blue'><b>Angela</b></font>) place by my side. He (<font color='blue'><b>Jacob</b></font>)
looked fourteen, maybe fifteen, and had long, glossy black hair pulled back with a rubber band at the
nape of his (<font color='blue'><b>Jacob</b></font>) neck. His (<font color='blue'><b>Jacob</b></font>) skin was beautiful, silky and russet-colored; his (<font color='blue'><b>Jacob</b></font>) eyes were dark, set deep above the
high planes of his (<font color='blue'><b>Jacob</b></font>) cheekbones. He (<font color='blue'><b>Jacob</b></font>) still had just a hint of childish roundness left around his (<font color='blue'><b>Jacob</b></font>) chin.
Altogether, a very pretty face. However, my positive opinion of his (<font color='blue'><b>Jacob</b></font>) looks was damaged by the first
words out of his (<font color='blue'><b>Jacob</b></font>) mouth.
<div class="bookquote">``You're Isabella Swan, aren't you?''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>It was like the first day of school all over again.
<div class="bookquote">``Bella,''  (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div>I sighed.
<div class="bookquote">``I'm Jacob Black.''  (<font color='red'><b>He</b></font>)</div>He (<font color='blue'><b>Jacob</b></font>) held his (<font color='blue'><b>Jacob</b></font>) hand out in a friendly gesture. <div class="bookquote">``You bought my dad's truck.''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``Oh,''  (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div>I said, relieved, shaking his (<font color='blue'><b>Jacob</b></font>) sleek hand. <div class="bookquote">``You're Billy's son. I probably should remember you.''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``No, I'm the youngest of the family  you would remember my older sisters.''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``Rachel and Rebecca,''  (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div>I suddenly recalled. Charlie and Billy had thrown us together a lot during my
visits, to keep us busy while they fished. We were all too shy to make much progress as friends. Of
course, I'd kicked up enough tantrums to end the fishing trips by the time I was eleven.
<div class="bookquote">``Are they here?''  (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div>I examined the girls at the ocean's edge, wondering if I would recognize them now.
<div class="bookquote">``No.''  (<font color='red'><b>Jacob/Jacob Black</b></font>)</div>Jacob shook his (<font color='blue'><b>Jacob</b></font>) head. <div class="bookquote">``Rachel got a scholarship to Washington State, and Rebecca married a
Samoan surfer  she (<font color='blue'><b>Rebecca</b></font>) lives in Hawaii now.''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``Married. Wow.''  (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div>I was stunned. The twins were only a little over a year older than I was.
<div class="bookquote">``So how do you like the truck?''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Jacob</b></font>) asked.
<div class="bookquote">``I love it. It runs great.''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``Yeah, but it's really slow,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Jacob</b></font>) laughed. <div class="bookquote">``I was so relived when Charlie bought it. My dad wouldn't let me
work on building another car when we had a perfectly good vehicle right there.''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``It's not that slow,''  (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div>I objected.
<div class="bookquote">``Have you tried to go over sixty?''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``No,''  (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div>I admitted.
<div class="bookquote">``Good. Don't.''  (<font color='red'><b>He</b></font>)</div>He (<font color='blue'><b>Jacob</b></font>) grinned.

<p/>I couldn't help grinning back. <div class="bookquote">``It does great in a collision,''  (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div>I offered in my truck's defense.
<div class="bookquote">``I don't think a tank could take out that old monster,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Jacob</b></font>) agreed with another laugh.
<div class="bookquote">``So you build cars?''  (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div>I asked, impressed.
<div class="bookquote">``When I have free time, and parts. You wouldn't happen to know where I could get my hands on a
master cylinder for a 1986 Volkswagen Rabbit?''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Jacob</b></font>) added jokingly. He (<font color='blue'><b>Jacob</b></font>) had a pleasant, husky voice.
<div class="bookquote">``Sorry,''  (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div>I laughed, <div class="bookquote">``I haven't seen any lately, but I'll keep my eyes open for you.''  (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div>As if I knew what that
was. He (<font color='blue'><b>Jacob</b></font>) was very easy to talk with.
He (<font color='blue'><b>Jacob</b></font>) flashed a brilliant smile, looking at me appreciatively in a way I was learning to recognize. I wasn't the
only one who noticed.
<div class="bookquote">``You know Bella, Jacob?''  (<font color='red'><b>Lauren</b></font>)</div>Lauren asked  in what I imagined was an insolent tone  from across the
fire.
<div class="bookquote">``We've sort of known each other since I was born,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Jacob</b></font>) laughed, smiling at me again.
<div class="bookquote">``How nice.''  (<font color='red'><b>She</b></font>)</div>She (<font color='blue'><b>Lauren</b></font>) didn't sound like she (<font color='blue'><b>Lauren</b></font>) thought it was nice at all, and her (<font color='blue'><b>Lauren</b></font>) pale, fishy eyes narrowed.
<div class="bookquote">``Bella,''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Lauren</b></font>) called again, watching my face carefully, <div class="bookquote">``I was just saying to Tyler that it was too bad none
of the Cullens could come out today. Didn't anyone think to invite them?''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>Her (<font color='blue'><b>Lauren</b></font>) expression of concern was
unconvincing.
<div class="bookquote">``You mean Dr. Carlisle Cullen's family?''  (<font color='red'><b>the boy</b></font>)</div>the tall, older boy asked before I could respond, much to
Lauren's irritation. He (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>) was really closer to a man than a boy, and his (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>) voice was very deep.
<div class="bookquote">``Yes, do you know them?''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Lauren</b></font>) asked condescendingly, turning halfway toward him (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>).
<div class="bookquote">``The Cullens don't come here,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>) said in a tone that closed the subject, ignoring her (<font color='blue'><b>Lauren</b></font>) question.
Tyler, trying to win back her (<font color='blue'><b>Lauren</b></font>) attention, asked Lauren's opinion on a CD he (<font color='blue'><b>Tyler</b></font>) held. She (<font color='blue'><b>Lauren</b></font>) was distracted.
I stared at the deep-voiced boy, taken aback, but he (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>) was looking away toward the dark forest behind
us. He (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>)'d said that the Cullens didn't come here, but his (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>) tone had implied something more  that they
weren't allowed; they were prohibited. His (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>) manner left a strange impression on me, and I tried to ignore it
without success.
Jacob interrupted my meditation. <div class="bookquote">``So is Forks driving you insane yet?''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``Oh, I'd say that's an understatement.''  (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div>I grimaced. He (<font color='blue'><b>Jacob</b></font>) grinned understandingly.
I was still turning over the brief comment on the Cullens, and I had a sudden inspiration. It was a stupid
plan, but I didn't have any better ideas. I hoped that young Jacob was as yet inexperienced around girls,
so that he (<font color='blue'><b>Jacob</b></font>) wouldn't see through my sure-to-be-pitiful attempts at flirting.
<div class="bookquote">``Do you want to walk down the beach with me?''  (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div>I asked, trying to imitate that way Edward had of
looking up from underneath his (<font color='blue'><b>Edward</b></font>) eyelashes. It couldn't have nearly the same effect, I was sure, but Jacob
jumped up willingly enough.
As we walked north across the multihued stones toward the driftwood seawall, the clouds finally closed
ranks across the sky, causing the sea to darken and the temperature to drop. I shoved my hands deep
into the pockets of my jacket.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``So you're, what, sixteen?''  (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div>I asked, trying not to look like an idiot as I fluttered my eyelids the way I'd
seen girls do on TV.
<div class="bookquote">``I just turned fifteen,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>idiot</b></font>) confessed, flattered.
<div class="bookquote">``Really?''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>My face was full of false surprise. <div class="bookquote">``I would have thought you were older.''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``I'm tall for my age,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>idiot</b></font>) explained.
<div class="bookquote">``Do you come up to Forks much?''  (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div>I asked archly, as if I was hoping for a yes. I sounded idiotic to
myself. I was afraid he (<font color='blue'><b>idiot</b></font>) would turn on me with disgust and accuse me of my fraud, but he (<font color='blue'><b>idiot</b></font>) still seemed
flattered.
<div class="bookquote">``Not too much,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>idiot</b></font>) admitted with a frown. <div class="bookquote">``But when I get my car finished I can go up as much as I want
 after I get my license,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>idiot</b></font>) amended.
<div class="bookquote">``Who was that other boy Lauren was talking to? He (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>) seemed a little old to be hanging out with us.''  (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div>I
purposefully lumped myself in with the youngsters, trying to make it clear that I preferred Jacob.
<div class="bookquote">``That's Sam  he (<font color='blue'><b>Sam</b></font>)'s nineteen,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Jacob</b></font>) informed me.
<div class="bookquote">``What was that he (<font color='blue'><b>Sam</b></font>) was saying about the doctor's family?''  (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div>I asked innocently.
<div class="bookquote">``The Cullens? Oh, they're not supposed to come onto the reservation.''  (<font color='red'><b>He</b></font>)</div>He (<font color='blue'><b>Jacob</b></font>) looked away, out toward
James Island, as he (<font color='blue'><b>Jacob</b></font>) confirmed what I'd thought I'd heard in Sam's voice.
<div class="bookquote">``Why not?''
 (<font color='red'><b>He</b></font>)</div>He (<font color='blue'><b>Sam</b></font>) glanced back at me, biting his (<font color='blue'><b>Sam</b></font>) lip. <div class="bookquote">``Oops. I'm not supposed to say anything about that.''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``Oh, I won't tell anyone, I'm just curious.''  (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div>I tried to make my smile alluring, wondering if I was laying it
on too thick.
He (<font color='blue'><b>Sam</b></font>) smiled back, though, looking allured. Then he (<font color='blue'><b>Sam</b></font>) lifted one eyebrow and his (<font color='blue'><b>Sam</b></font>) voice was even huskier than
before.
<div class="bookquote">``Do you like scary stories?''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Sam</b></font>) asked ominously.
<div class="bookquote">``I love them,''  (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div>I enthused, making an effort to smolder at him (<font color='blue'><b>Sam</b></font>).
Jacob strolled to a nearby driftwood tree that had its roots sticking out like the attenuated legs of a huge,
pale spider. He (<font color='blue'><b>Jacob</b></font>) perched lightly on one of the twisted roots while I sat beneath him (<font color='blue'><b>Jacob</b></font>) on the body of the
tree. He (<font color='blue'><b>Jacob</b></font>) stared down at the rocks, a smile hovering around the edges of his (<font color='blue'><b>Jacob</b></font>) broad lips. I could see he (<font color='blue'><b>Jacob</b></font>)
was going to try to make this good. I focused on keeping the vital interest I felt out of my eyes.
<div class="bookquote">``Do you know any of our old stories, about where we came from  the Quileutes, I mean?''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Jacob</b></font>) began.
<div class="bookquote">``Not really,''  (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div>I admitted.
<div class="bookquote">``Well, there are lots of legends, some of them claiming to date back to the Flood  supposedly, the
ancient Quileutes tied their canoes to the tops of the tallest trees on the mountain to survive like Noah and
the ark.''  (<font color='red'><b>He</b></font>)</div>He (<font color='blue'><b>Jacob</b></font>) smiled, to show me how little stock he (<font color='blue'><b>Jacob</b></font>) put in the histories. ``Another legend claims that we
descended from wolves  and that the wolves are our brothers still. It's against tribal law to kill them.
<div class="bookquote">``Then there are the stories about the cold ones.''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>His (<font color='blue'><b>Jacob</b></font>) voice dropped a little lower.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``The cold ones?''  (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div>I asked, not faking my intrigue now.
<div class="bookquote">``Yes. There are stories of the cold ones as old as the wolf legends, and some much more recent.
According to legend, my own great-grandfather knew some of them. He (<font color='blue'><b>great-grandfather</b></font>) was the one who made the
treaty that kept them off our land.''  (<font color='red'><b>He</b></font>)</div>He (<font color='blue'><b>Jacob</b></font>) rolled his (<font color='blue'><b>Jacob</b></font>) eyes.
<div class="bookquote">``Your great-grandfather?''  (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div>I encouraged.
<div class="bookquote">``He (<font color='blue'><b>great-grandfather</b></font>) was a tribal elder, like my father. You see, the cold ones are the natural enemies of the wolfwell,
not the wolf, really, but the wolves that turn into men, like our ancestors. You would call them
werewolves.''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``Werewolves have enemies?''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``Only one.''
 (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div>I stared at him (<font color='blue'><b>Jacob</b></font>) earnestly, hoping to disguise my impatience as admiration.
<div class="bookquote">``So you see,''  (<font color='red'><b>Jacob/Jacob Black</b></font>)</div>Jacob continued, <div class="bookquote">``the cold ones are traditionally our enemies. But this pack that came to
our territory during my great-grandfather's time was different. They didn't hunt the way others of their
kind did  they weren't supposed to be dangerous to the tribe. So my great-grandfather made a truce
with them. If they would promise to stay off our lands, we wouldn't expose them to the pale-faces.''  (<font color='red'><b>Jacob/Jacob Black</b></font>)</div>He (<font color='blue'><b>Jacob</b></font>)
winked at me.
<div class="bookquote">``If they weren't dangerous, then why ?''  (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div>I tried to understand, struggling not to let him (<font color='blue'><b>Jacob</b></font>) see how
seriously I was considering his (<font color='blue'><b>Jacob</b></font>) ghost story.
<div class="bookquote">``There's always a risk for humans to be around the cold ones, even if they're civilized like this clan was.
You never know when they might get too hungry to resist.''  (<font color='red'><b>He</b></font>)</div>He (<font color='blue'><b>Jacob</b></font>) deliberately worked a thick edge of
menace into his (<font color='blue'><b>Jacob</b></font>) tone.
<div class="bookquote">``What do you mean, `civilized'?''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``They claimed that they didn't hunt humans. They supposedly were somehow able to prey on animals
instead.''
 (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div>I tried to keep my voice casual. <div class="bookquote">``So how does it fit in with the Cullens? Are they like the cold ones your
greatgrandfather met?''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``No.''  (<font color='red'><b>He</b></font>)</div>He (<font color='blue'><b>Jacob</b></font>) paused dramatically. <div class="bookquote">``They are the same ones.''
 (<font color='red'><b>He</b></font>)</div>He (<font color='blue'><b>Jacob</b></font>) must have thought the expression on my face was fear inspired by his (<font color='blue'><b>Jacob</b></font>) story. He (<font color='blue'><b>Jacob</b></font>) smiled, pleased, and
continued.
<div class="bookquote">``There are more of them now, a new female and a new male, but the rest are the same. In my
great-grandfather's time they already knew of the leader, Carlisle. He (<font color='blue'><b>Carlisle</b></font>)'d been here and gone before your
people had even arrived.''  (<font color='red'><b>He</b></font>)</div>He (<font color='blue'><b>Jacob</b></font>) was fighting a smile.
<div class="bookquote">``And what are they?''  (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div>I finally asked. <div class="bookquote">``What are the cold ones?''
 (<font color='red'><b>He</b></font>)</div>He (<font color='blue'><b>Jacob</b></font>) smiled darkly.
<div class="bookquote">``Blood drinkers,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Jacob</b></font>) replied in a chilling voice. <div class="bookquote">``Your people call them vampires.''
 (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div>I stared out at the rough surf after he (<font color='blue'><b>Jacob</b></font>) answered, not sure what my face was exposing.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``You have goose bumps,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Jacob</b></font>) laughed delightedly.
<div class="bookquote">``You're a good storyteller,''  (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div>I complimented him (<font color='blue'><b>Jacob</b></font>), still staring into the waves.
<div class="bookquote">``Pretty crazy stuff, though, isn't it? No wonder my dad doesn't want us to talk about it to anyone.''
 (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div>I couldn't control my expression enough to look at him (<font color='blue'><b>Jacob</b></font>) yet. <div class="bookquote">``Don't worry, I won't give you away.''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``I guess I just violated the treaty,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Jacob</b></font>) laughed.
<div class="bookquote">``I'll take it to the grave,''  (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div>I promised, and then I shivered.
<div class="bookquote">``Seriously, though, don't say anything to Charlie. He (<font color='blue'><b>Charlie</b></font>) was pretty mad at my dad when he (<font color='blue'><b>Charlie</b></font>) heard that some
of us weren't going to the hospital since Dr. Cullen started working there.''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``I won't, of course not.''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``So do you think we're a bunch of superstitious natives or what?''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Jacob</b></font>) asked in a playful tone, but with a
hint of worry. I still hadn't looked away from the ocean.
I turned and smiled at him (<font color='blue'><b>Jacob</b></font>) as normally as I could.
<div class="bookquote">``No. I think you're very good at telling scary stories, though. I still have goose bumps, see?''  (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div>I held up my
arm.
<div class="bookquote">``Cool.''  (<font color='red'><b>He</b></font>)</div>He (<font color='blue'><b>Jacob</b></font>) smiled.
And then the sound of the beach rocks clattering against each other warned us that someone was
approaching. Our heads snapped up at the same time to see Mike and Jessica about fifty yards away,
walking toward us.
<div class="bookquote">``There you are, Bella,''  (<font color='red'><b>Mike/Mike Newton/Newton</b></font>)</div>Mike called in relief, waving his (<font color='blue'><b>Mike</b></font>) arm over his (<font color='blue'><b>Mike</b></font>) head.
<div class="bookquote">``Is that your boyfriend?''  (<font color='red'><b>Jacob/Jacob Black</b></font>)</div>Jacob asked, alerted by the jealous edge in Mike's voice. I was surprised it was
so obvious.
<div class="bookquote">``No, definitely not,''  (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div>I whispered. I was tremendously grateful to Jacob, and eager to make him (<font color='blue'><b>Jacob</b></font>) as happy
as possible. I winked at him (<font color='blue'><b>Jacob</b></font>), carefully turning away from Mike to do so. He (<font color='blue'><b>Mike</b></font>) smiled, elated by my inept
flirting.
<div class="bookquote">``So when I get my license''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Mike</b></font>) began.
<div class="bookquote">``You should come see me in Forks. We could hang out sometime.''  (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div>I felt guilty as I said this, knowing
that I'd used him (<font color='blue'><b>Mike</b></font>). But I really did like Jacob. He (<font color='blue'><b>Jacob</b></font>) was someone I could easily be friends with.
Mike had reached us now, with Jessica still a few paces back. I could see his (<font color='blue'><b>Mike</b></font>) eyes appraising Jacob, and
looking satisfied at his (<font color='blue'><b>Mike</b></font>) obvious youth.
<div class="bookquote">``Where have you been?''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Mike</b></font>) asked, though the answer was right in front of him (<font color='blue'><b>Mike</b></font>).
<div class="bookquote">``Jacob was just telling me some local stories,''  (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div>I volunteered. <div class="bookquote">``It was really interesting.''
 (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div>I smiled at Jacob warmly, and he (<font color='blue'><b>Jacob</b></font>) grinned back.
<div class="bookquote">``Well,''  (<font color='red'><b>Mike/Mike Newton/Newton</b></font>)</div>Mike paused, carefully reassessing the situation as he (<font color='blue'><b>Mike</b></font>) watched our camaraderie. <div class="bookquote">``We're packing
up  it looks like it's going to rain soon.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/>We all looked up at the glowering sky. It certainly did look like rain.
<div class="bookquote">``Okay.''  (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div>I jumped up. <div class="bookquote">``I'm coming.''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``It was nice to see you again,''  (<font color='red'><b>Jacob/Jacob Black</b></font>)</div>Jacob said, and I could tell he (<font color='blue'><b>Jacob</b></font>) was taunting Mike just a bit.
<div class="bookquote">``It really was. Next time Charlie comes down to see Billy, I'll come, too,''  (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div>I promised.
His (<font color='blue'><b>Mike</b></font>) grin stretched across his (<font color='blue'><b>Mike</b></font>) face. <div class="bookquote">``That would be cool.''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``And thanks,''  (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div>I added earnestly.
I pulled up my hood as we tramped across the rocks toward the parking lot. A few drops were
beginning to fall, making black spots on the stones where they landed. When we got to the Suburban the
others were already loading everything back in. I crawled into the backseat by Angela and Tyler,
announcing that I'd already had my turn in the shotgun position. Angela just stared out the window at the
escalating storm, and Lauren twisted around in the middle seat to occupy Tyler's attention, so I could
simply lay my head back on the seat and close my eyes and try very hard not to think.

<p/>7. NIGHTMARE

<p/>I told Charlie I had a lot of homework to do, and that I didn't want anything to eat. There was a
basketball game on that he (<font color='blue'><b>Charlie</b></font>) was excited about, though of course I had no idea what was special about it,
so he (<font color='blue'><b>Charlie</b></font>) wasn't aware of anything unusual in my face or tone.
Once in my room, I locked the door. I dug through my desk until I found my old headphones, and I
plugged them into my little CD player. I picked up a CD that Phil had given to me for Christmas. It was
one of his (<font color='blue'><b>Phil</b></font>) favorite bands, but they used a little too much bass and shrieking for my tastes. I popped it into
place and lay down on my bed. I put on the headphones, hit Play, and turned up the volume until it hurt
my ears. I closed my eyes, but the light still intruded, so I added a pillow over the top half of my face.
I concentrated very carefully on the music, trying to understand the lyrics, to unravel the complicated
drum patterns. By the third time I'd listened through the CD, I knew all the words to the choruses, at
least. I was surprised to find that I really did like the band after all, once I got past the blaring noise. I'd
have to thank Phil again.
And it worked. The shattering beats made it impossible for me to think  which was the whole purpose
of the exercise. I listened to the CD again and again, until I was singing along with all the songs, until,
finally, I fell asleep.
I opened my eyes to a familiar place. Aware in some corner of my consciousness that I was dreaming, I
recognized the green light of the forest. I could hear the waves crashing against the rocks somewhere
nearby. And I knew that if I found the ocean, I'd be able to see the sun. I was trying to follow the sound,
but then Jacob Black was there, tugging on my hand, pulling me back toward the blackest part of the
forest.
<div class="bookquote">``Jacob? What's wrong?''  (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div>I asked. His (<font color='blue'><b>Black</b></font>) face was frightened as he (<font color='blue'><b>Black</b></font>) yanked with all his (<font color='blue'><b>Black</b></font>) strength against my
resistance; I didn't want to go into the dark.
<div class="bookquote">``Run, Bella, you have to run!''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Black</b></font>) whispered, terrified.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``This way, Bella!''  (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div>I recognized Mike's voice calling out of the gloomy heart of the trees, but I couldn't
see him (<font color='blue'><b>Black</b></font>).
<div class="bookquote">``Why?''  (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div>I asked, still pulling against Jacob's grasp, desperate now to find the sun.
But Jacob let go of my hand and yelped, suddenly shaking, falling to the dim forest floor. He (<font color='blue'><b>Jacob</b></font>) twitched on
the ground as I watched in horror.
<div class="bookquote">``Jacob!''  (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div>I screamed. But he (<font color='blue'><b>Jacob</b></font>) was gone. In his (<font color='blue'><b>Jacob</b></font>) place was a large red-brown wolf with black eyes. The
wolf faced away from me, pointing toward the shore, the hair on the back of his (<font color='blue'><b>wolf</b></font>) shoulders bristling, low
growls issuing from between his (<font color='blue'><b>wolf</b></font>) exposed fangs.
<div class="bookquote">``Bella, run!''  (<font color='red'><b>Mike/Mike Newton/Newton</b></font>)</div>Mike cried out again from behind me. But I didn't turn. I was watching a light coming toward
me from the beach.
And then Edward stepped out from the trees, his (<font color='blue'><b>Edward</b></font>) skin faintly glowing, his (<font color='blue'><b>Edward</b></font>) eyes black and dangerous. He (<font color='blue'><b>Edward</b></font>)
held up one hand and beckoned me to come to him (<font color='blue'><b>Edward</b></font>). The wolf growled at my feet.
I took a step forward, toward Edward. He (<font color='blue'><b>Edward</b></font>) smiled then, and his (<font color='blue'><b>Edward</b></font>) teeth were sharp, pointed.
<div class="bookquote">``Trust me,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Edward</b></font>) purred.
I took another step.
The wolf launched himself across the space between me and the vampire, fangs aiming for the jugular.
<div class="bookquote">``No!''  (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div>I screamed, wrenching upright out of my bed.
My sudden movement caused the headphones to pull the CD player off the bedside table, and it clattered
to the wooden floor.
My light was still on, and I was sitting fully dressed on the bed, with my shoes on. I glanced, disoriented,
at the clock on my dresser. It was five-thirty in the morning.
I groaned, fell back, and rolled over onto my face, kicking off my boots. I was too uncomfortable to get
anywhere near sleep, though. I rolled back over and unbuttoned my jeans, yanking them off awkwardly
as I tried to stay horizontal. I could feel the braid in my hair, an uncomfortable ridge along the back of my
skull. I turned onto my side and ripped the rubber band out, quickly combing through the plaits with my
fingers. I pulled the pillow back over my eyes.
It was all no use, of course. My subconscious had dredged up exactly the images I'd been trying so
desperately to avoid. I was going to have to face them now.
I sat up, and my head spun for a minute as the blood flowed downward. First things first, I thought to
myself, happy to put it off as long as possible. I grabbed my bathroom bag.
The shower didn't last nearly as long as I hoped it would, though. Even taking the time to blow-dry my
hair, I was soon out of things to do in the bathroom. Wrapped in a towel, I crossed back to my room. I
couldn't tell if Charlie was still asleep, or if he (<font color='blue'><b>Charlie</b></font>) had already left. I went to look out my window, and the
cruiser was gone. Fishing again.
I dressed slowly in my most comfy sweats and then made my bed  something I never did. I couldn't
put it off any longer. I went to my desk and switched on my old computer.
I hated using the Internet here. My modem was sadly outdated, my free service substandard; just dialing

<p/>up took so long that I decided to go get myself a bowl of cereal while I waited.
I ate slowly, chewing each bite with care. When I was done, I washed the bowl and spoon, dried them,
and put them away. My feet dragged as I climbed the stairs. I went to my CD player first, picking it up
off the floor and placing it precisely in the center of the table. I pulled out the headphones, and put them
away in the desk drawer. Then I turned the same CD on, turning it down to the point where it was
background noise.
With another sigh, I turned to my computer. Naturally, the screen was covered in pop-up ads. I sat in my
hard folding chair and began closing all the little windows. Eventually I made it to my favorite search
engine. I shot down a few more pop-ups and then typed in one word.
Vampire.
It took an infuriatingly long time, of course. When the results came up, there was a lot to sift through 
everything from movies and TV shows to role-playing games, underground metal, and gothic cosmetic
companies.
Then I found a promising site  Vampires AZ. I waited impatiently for it to load, quickly clicking
closed each ad that flashed across the screen. Finally the screen was finished  simple white
background with black text, academic-looking. Two quotes greeted me on the home page:

<p/>Throughout the vast shadowy world of ghosts and demons there is no figure so terrible, no figure
so dreaded and abhorred, yet dight with such fearful fascination, as the vampire, who is himself
neither ghost nor demon, but yet who partakes the dark natures and possesses the mysterious and
terrible qualities of both.  Rev. Montague Summers

<p/>If there is in this world a well-attested account, it is that of the vampires. Nothing is lacking:
official reports, affidavits of well-known people, of surgeons, of priests, of magistrates; the
judicial proof is most complete. And with all that, who is there who believes in vampires? 
Rousseau

<p/>The rest of the site was an alphabetized listing of all the different myths of vampires held throughout the
world. The first I clicked on, the Danag, was a Filipino vampire supposedly responsible for planting taro
on the islands long ago. The myth continued that the Danag worked with humans for many years, but the
partnership ended one day when a woman cut her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) finger and a Danag sucked her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) wound, enjoying the
taste so much that it drained her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) body completely of blood.
I read carefully through the descriptions, looking for anything that sounded familiar, let alone plausible. It
seemed that most vampire myths centered around beautiful women as demons and children as victims;
they also seemed like constructs created to explain away the high mortality rates for young children, and
to give men an excuse for infidelity. Many of the stories involved bodiless spirits and warnings against
improper burials. There wasn't much that sounded like the movies I'd seen, and only a very few, like the
Hebrew Estrie and the Polish Upier, who were even preoccupied with drinking blood.
Only three entries really caught my attention: the Romanian Varacolaci, a powerful undead being who
could appear as a beautiful, pale-skinned human, the Slovak Nelapsi, a creature so strong and fast it

<p/>could massacre an entire village in the single hour after midnight, and one other, the Stregoni benefici.
About this last there was only one brief sentence.
Stregoni benefici: An Italian vampire, said to be on the side of goodness, and a mortal enemy of
all evil vampires.
It was a relief, that one small entry, the one myth among hundreds that claimed the existence of good
vampires.
Overall, though, there was little that coincided with Jacob's stories or my own observations. I'd made a
little catalogue in my mind as I'd read and carefully compared it with each myth. Speed, strength, beauty,
pale skin, eyes that shift color; and then Jacob's criteria: blood drinkers, enemies of the werewolf,
cold-skinned, and immortal. There were very few myths that matched even one factor.
And then another problem, one that I'd remembered from the small number of scary movies that I'd seen
and was backed up by today's reading  vampires couldn't come out in the daytime, the sun would burn
them to a cinder. They slept in coffins all day and came out only at night.
Aggravated, I snapped off the computer's main power switch, not waiting to shut things down properly.
Through my irritation, I felt overwhelming embarrassment. It was all so stupid. I was sitting in my room,
researching vampires. What was wrong with me? I decided that most of the blame belonged on the
doorstep of the town of Forks  and the entire sodden Olympic Peninsula, for that matter.
I had to get out of the house, but there was nowhere I wanted to go that didn't involve a three-day drive.
I pulled on my boots anyway, unclear where I was headed, and went downstairs. I shrugged into my
raincoat without checking the weather and stomped out the door.
It was overcast, but not raining yet. I ignored my truck and started east on foot, angling across Charlie's
yard toward the ever-encroaching forest. It didn't take long till I was deep enough for the house and the
road to be invisible, for the only sound to be the squish of the damp earth under my feet and the sudden
cries of the jays.
There was a thin ribbon of a trail that led through the forest here, or I wouldn't risk wandering on my own
like this. My sense of direction was hopeless; I could get lost in much less helpful surroundings. The trail
wound deeper and deeper into the forest, mostly east as far as I could tell. It snaked around the Sitka
spruces and the hemlocks, the yews and the maples. I only vaguely knew the names of the trees around
me, and all I knew was due to Charlie pointing them out to me from the cruiser window in earlier days.
There were many I didn't know, and others I couldn't be sure about because they were so covered in
green parasites.
I followed the trail as long as my anger at myself pushed me forward. As that started to ebb, I slowed. A
few drops of moisture trickled down from the canopy above me, but I couldn't be certain if it was
beginning to rain or if it was simply pools left over from yesterday, held high in the leaves above me,
slowly dripping their way back to the earth. A recently fallen tree  I knew it was recent because it
wasn't entirely carpeted in moss  rested against the trunk of one of her (<font color='blue'><b>I</b></font>) sisters, creating a sheltered little
bench just a few safe feet off the trail. I stepped over the ferns and sat carefully, making sure my jacket
was between the damp seat and my clothes wherever they touched, and leaned my hooded head back
against the living tree.
This was the wrong place to have come. I should have known, but where else was there to go? The
forest was deep green and far too much like the scene in last night's dream to allow for peace of mind.
Now that there was no longer the sound of my soggy footsteps, the silence was piercing. The birds were

<p/>quiet, too, the drops increasing in frequency, so it must be raining above. The ferns stood higher than my
head, now that I was seated, and I knew someone could walk by on the path, three feet away, and not
see me.
Here in the trees it was much easier to believe the absurdities that embarrassed me indoors. Nothing had
changed in this forest for thousands of years, and all the myths and legends of a hundred different lands
seemed much more likely in this green haze than they had in my clear-cut bedroom.
I forced myself to focus on the two most vital questions I had to answer, but I did so unwillingly.
First, I had to decide if it was possible that what Jacob had said about the Cullens could be true.
Immediately my mind responded with a resounding negative. It was silly and morbid to entertain such
ridiculous notions. But what, then? I asked myself. There was no rational explanation for how I was alive
at this moment. I listed again in my head the things I'd observed myself: the impossible speed and
strength, the eye color shifting from black to gold and back again, the inhuman beauty, the pale, frigid
skin. And more  small things that registered slowly  how they never seemed to eat, the disturbing
grace with which they moved. And the way be
sometimes spoke, with unfamiliar cadences and phrases that better fit the style of a turn-of-the-century
novel than that of a twenty-first-century classroom. He (<font color='blue'><b>myself</b></font>) had skipped class the day we'd done blood
typing. He (<font color='blue'><b>myself</b></font>) hadn't said no to the beach trip till he (<font color='blue'><b>myself</b></font>) heard where we were going. He (<font color='blue'><b>myself</b></font>) seemed to know what
everyone around him (<font color='blue'><b>myself</b></font>) was thinking except me. He (<font color='blue'><b>myself</b></font>) had told me he (<font color='blue'><b>myself</b></font>) was the villain, dangerous
Could the Cullens be vampires?
Well, they were something. Something outside the possibility of rational justification was taking place in
front of my incredulous eyes. Whether it be Jacob's cold ones or my own superhero theory, Edward
Cullen was not human. He (<font color='blue'><b>Cullen</b></font>) was something more.
So then  maybe. That would have to be my answer for now.
And then the most important question of all. What was I going to do if it was true?
If Edward was a vampire  I could hardly make myself think the words  then what should I do?
Involving someone else was definitely out. I couldn't even believe myself; anyone I told would have me
committed.
Only two options seemed practical. The first was to take his (<font color='blue'><b>Edward</b></font>) advice: to be smart, to avoid him (<font color='blue'><b>Edward</b></font>) as much as
possible. To cancel our plans, to go back to ignoring him (<font color='blue'><b>Edward</b></font>) as far as I was able. To pretend there was an
impenetrably thick glass wall between us in the one class where we were forced together. To tell him (<font color='blue'><b>Edward</b></font>) to
leave me alone  and mean it this time.
I was gripped in a sudden agony of despair as I considered that alternative. My mind rejected the pain,
quickly skipping on to the next option.
I could do nothing different. After all, if he (<font color='blue'><b>Edward</b></font>) was something sinister, he (<font color='blue'><b>Edward</b></font>)'d done nothing to hurt me so far.
In fact, I would be a dent in Tyler's fender if he (<font color='blue'><b>Tyler</b></font>) hadn't acted so quickly. So quickly, I argued with myself,
that it might have been sheer reflexes. But if it was a reflex to save lives, how bad could he (<font color='blue'><b>Tyler</b></font>) be? I retorted.
My head spun around in answerless circles.
There was one thing I was sure of, if I was sure of anything. The dark Edward in my dream last night was
a reflection only of my fear of the word Jacob had spoken, and not Edward himself. Even so, when I'd
screamed out in terror at the werewolf's lunge, it wasn't fear for the wolf that brought the cry of <div class="bookquote">``no''  (<font color='red'><b>the wolf</b></font>)</div>to

<p/>my lips. It was fear that he (<font color='blue'><b>wolf</b></font>) would be harmed  even as he (<font color='blue'><b>wolf</b></font>) called to me with sharp-edged fangs, I feared
for him (<font color='blue'><b>wolf</b></font>).
And I knew in that I had my answer. I didn't know if there ever was a choice, really. I was already in too
deep. Now that I knew  if I knew  I could do nothing about my frightening secret. Because when I
thought of him (<font color='blue'><b>wolf</b></font>), of his (<font color='blue'><b>wolf</b></font>) voice, his (<font color='blue'><b>wolf</b></font>) hypnotic eyes, the magnetic force of his (<font color='blue'><b>wolf</b></font>) personality, I wanted nothing
more than to be with him (<font color='blue'><b>wolf</b></font>) right now. Even if but I couldn't think it. Not here, alone in the darkening
forest. Not while the rain made it dim as twilight under the canopy and pattered like footsteps across the
matted earthen floor. I shivered and rose quickly from my place of concealment, worried that somehow
the path would have disappeared with the rain.
But it was there, safe and clear, winding its way out of the dripping green maze. I followed it hastily, my
hood pulled close around my face, becoming surprised, as I nearly ran through the trees, at how far I had
come. I started to wonder if I was heading out at all, or following the path farther into the confines of the
forest. Before I could get too panicky, though, I began to glimpse some open spaces through the webbed
branches. And then I could hear a car passing on the street, and I was free, Charlie's lawn stretched out
in front of me, the house beckoning me, promising warmth and dry socks.
It was just noon when I got back inside. I went upstairs and got dressed for the day, jeans and a t-shirt,
since I was staying indoors. It didn't take too much effort to concentrate on my task for the day, a paper
on Macbeth that was due Wednesday. I settled into outlining a rough draft contentedly, more serene than
I'd felt since well, since Thursday afternoon, if I was being honest.
That had always been my way, though. Making decisions was the painful part for me, the part I agonized
over. But once the decision was made, I simply followed through  usually with relief that the choice
was made. Sometimes the relief was tainted by despair, like my decision to come to Forks. But it was
still better than wrestling with the alternatives.
This decision was ridiculously easy to live with. Dangerously easy.
And so the day was quiet, productive  I finished my paper before eight. Charlie came home with a
large catch, and I made a mental note to pick up a book of recipes for fish while I was in Seattle next
week. The chills that flashed up my spine whenever I thought of that trip were no different than the ones
I'd felt before I'd taken my walk with Jacob Black. They should be different, I thought. I should be afraid
 I knew I should be, but I couldn't feel the right kind of fear.
I slept dreamlessly that night, exhausted from beginning my day so early, and sleeping so poorly the night
before. I woke, for the second time since arriving in Forks, to the bright yellow light of a sunny day. I
skipped to the window, stunned to see that there was hardly a cloud in the sky, and those there were just
fleecy little white puffs that couldn't possibly be carrying any rain. I opened the window  surprised
when it opened silently, without sticking, not having opened it in who knows how many years  and
sucked in the relatively dry air. It was nearly warm and hardly windy at all. My blood was electric in my
veins.
Charlie was finishing breakfast when I came downstairs, and he (<font color='blue'><b>Charlie</b></font>) picked up on my mood immediately.
<div class="bookquote">``Nice day out,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Charlie</b></font>) commented.
<div class="bookquote">``Yes,''  (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div>I agreed with a grin.
He (<font color='blue'><b>Charlie</b></font>) smiled back, his (<font color='blue'><b>Charlie</b></font>) brown eyes crinkling around the edges. When Charlie smiled, it was easier to see
why he (<font color='blue'><b>Charlie</b></font>) and my mother had jumped too quickly into an early marriage. Most of the young romantic he (<font color='blue'><b>Charlie</b></font>)'d
been in those days had faded before I'd known him (<font color='blue'><b>Charlie</b></font>), as the curly brown hair  the same color, if not the

<p/>same texture, as mine  had dwindled, slowly revealing more and more of the shiny skin of his (<font color='blue'><b>Charlie</b></font>) forehead.
But when he (<font color='blue'><b>Charlie</b></font>) smiled I could see a little of the man who had run away with Rene when she (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) was just two
years older than I was now.
I ate breakfast cheerily, watching the dust moats stirring in the sunlight that streamed in the back window.
Charlie called out a goodbye, and I heard the cruiser pull away from the house. I hesitated on my way
out the door, hand on my rain jacket. It would be tempting fate to leave it home. With a sigh, I folded it
over my arm and stepped out into the brightest light I'd seen in months.
By dint of much elbow grease, I was able to get both windows in the truck almost completely rolled
down. I was one of the first ones to school; I hadn't even checked the clock in my hurry to get outside. I
parked and headed toward the seldom-used picnic benches on the south side of the cafeteria. The
benches were still a little damp, so I sat on my jacket, glad to have a use for it. My homework was done
 the product of a slow social life  but there were a few Trig problems I wasn't sure I had right. I
took out my book industriously, but halfway through rechecking the first problem I was daydreaming,
watching the sunlight play on the red-barked trees. I sketched inattentively along the margins of my
homework. After a few minutes, I suddenly realized I'd drawn five pairs of dark eyes staring out of the
page at me. I scrubbed them out with the eraser.
<div class="bookquote">``Bella!''  (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div>I heard someone call, and it sounded like Mike.
I looked around to realize that the school had become populated while I'd been sitting there,
absentminded. Everyone was in t-shirts, some even in shorts though the temperature couldn't be over
sixty. Mike was coming toward me in khaki shorts and a striped Rugby shirt, waving.
<div class="bookquote">``Hey, Mike,''  (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div>I called, waving back, unable to be halfhearted on a morning like this.
He (<font color='blue'><b>Mike</b></font>) came to sit by me, the tidy spikes of his (<font color='blue'><b>Mike</b></font>) hair shining golden in the light, his (<font color='blue'><b>Mike</b></font>) grin stretching across his (<font color='blue'><b>Mike</b></font>)
face. He (<font color='blue'><b>Mike</b></font>) was so delighted to see me, I couldn't help but feel gratified.
<div class="bookquote">``I never noticed before  your hair has red in it,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Mike</b></font>) commented, catching between his (<font color='blue'><b>Mike</b></font>) fingers a strand
that was fluttering in the light breeze.
<div class="bookquote">``Only in the sun.''
 (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div>I became just a little uncomfortable as he (<font color='blue'><b>Mike</b></font>) tucked the lock behind my ear.
<div class="bookquote">``Great day, isn't it?''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``My kind of day,''  (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div>I agreed.
<div class="bookquote">``What did you do yesterday?''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>His (<font color='blue'><b>Mike</b></font>) tone was just a bit too proprietary.
<div class="bookquote">``I mostly worked on my essay.''  (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div>I didn't add that I was finished with it  no need to sound smug.
He (<font color='blue'><b>Mike</b></font>) hit his (<font color='blue'><b>Mike</b></font>) forehead with the heel of his (<font color='blue'><b>Mike</b></font>) hand. <div class="bookquote">``Oh yeah  that's due Thursday, right?''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``Um, Wednesday, I think.''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``Wednesday?''  (<font color='red'><b>He</b></font>)</div>He (<font color='blue'><b>Mike</b></font>) frowned. <div class="bookquote">``That's not good What are you writing yours on?''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``Whether Shakespeare's treatment of the female characters is misogynistic.''
 (<font color='red'><b>He</b></font>)</div>He (<font color='blue'><b>Mike</b></font>) stared at me like I'd just spoken in pig Latin.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``I guess I'll have to get to work on that tonight,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Mike</b></font>) said, deflated. <div class="bookquote">``I was going to ask if you wanted to go
out.''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``Oh.''  (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div>I was taken off guard. Why couldn't I ever have a pleasant conversation with Mike anymore
without it getting awkward?
<div class="bookquote">``Well, we could go to dinner or something and I could work on it later.''  (<font color='red'><b>He</b></font>)</div>He (<font color='blue'><b>Mike</b></font>) smiled at me hopefully.
<div class="bookquote">``Mike''  (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div>I hated being put on the spot. <div class="bookquote">``I don't think that would be the best idea.''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>His (<font color='blue'><b>Mike</b></font>) face fell. <div class="bookquote">``Why?''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Mike</b></font>) asked, his (<font color='blue'><b>Mike</b></font>) eyes guarded. My thoughts flickered to Edward, wondering if that's
where his (<font color='blue'><b>Edward</b></font>) thoughts were as well.
<div class="bookquote">``I think and if you ever repeat what I'm saying right now I will cheerfully beat you to death,''  (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div>I
threatened, <div class="bookquote">``but I think that would hurt Jessica's feelings.''
 (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div>He (<font color='blue'><b>Edward</b></font>) was bewildered, obviously not thinking in that direction at all. <div class="bookquote">``Jessica?''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``Really, Mike, are you blind?''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``Oh,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Edward</b></font>) exhaled  clearly dazed. I took advantage of that to make my escape.
<div class="bookquote">``It's time for class, and I can't be late again.''  (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div>I gathered my books up and stuffed them in my bag.
We walked in silence to building three, and his (<font color='blue'><b>Edward</b></font>) expression was distracted. I hoped whatever thoughts he (<font color='blue'><b>Edward</b></font>)
was immersed in were leading him (<font color='blue'><b>Edward</b></font>) in the right direction.
When I saw Jessica in Trig, she (<font color='blue'><b>Jessica</b></font>) was bubbling with enthusiasm. She (<font color='blue'><b>Jessica</b></font>), Angela, and Lauren were going to
Port Angeles tonight to go dress shopping for the dance, and she (<font color='blue'><b>Angela</b></font>) wanted me to come, too, even though I
didn't need one. I was indecisive. It would be nice to get out of town with some girlfriends, but Lauren
would be there. And who knew what I could be doing tonight But that was definitely the wrong path
to let my mind wander down. Of course I was happy about the sunlight. But that wasn't completely
responsible for the euphoric mood I was in, not even close.
So I gave her (<font color='blue'><b>Lauren</b></font>) a maybe, telling her (<font color='blue'><b>Lauren</b></font>) I'd have to talk with Charlie first.
She (<font color='blue'><b>Lauren</b></font>) talked of nothing but the dance on the way to Spanish, continuing as if without an interruption when
class finally ended, five minutes late, and we were on our way to lunch. I was far too lost in my own
frenzy of anticipation to notice much of what she (<font color='blue'><b>Lauren</b></font>) said. I was painfully eager to see not just him (<font color='blue'><b>Charlie</b></font>) but all the
Cullens  to compare them with the new suspicions that plagued my mind. As I crossed the threshold of
the cafeteria, I felt the first true tingle of fear slither down my spine and settle in my stomach. Would they
be able to know what I was thinking? And then a different feeling jolted through me  would Edward be
waiting to sit with me again?
As was my routine, I glanced first toward the Cullens' table. A shiver of panic trembled in my stomach as
I realized it was empty. With dwindling hope, my eyes scoured the rest of the cafeteria, hoping to find
him (<font color='blue'><b>Edward</b></font>) alone, waiting for me. The place was nearly filled  Spanish had made us late  but there was no
sign of Edward or any of his (<font color='blue'><b>Edward</b></font>) family. Desolation hit me with crippling strength.
I shambled along behind Jessica, not bothering to pretend to listen anymore.
We were late enough that everyone was already at our table. I avoided the empty chair next to Mike in
favor of one by Angela. I vaguely noticed that Mike held the chair out politely for Jessica, and that her (<font color='blue'><b>Jessica</b></font>)
face lit up in response.

<p/>Angela asked a few quiet questions about the Macbeth paper, which I answered as naturally as I could
while spiraling downward in misery. She (<font color='blue'><b>Angela</b></font>), too, invited me to go with them tonight, and I agreed now,
grasping at anything to distract myself.
I realized I'd been holding on to a last shred of hope when I entered Biology, saw his (<font color='blue'><b>Macbeth</b></font>) empty seat, and felt
a new wave of disappointment.
The rest of the day passed slowly, dismally. In Gym, we had a lecture on the rules of badminton, the next
torture they had lined up for me. But at least it meant I got to sit and listen instead of stumbling around on
the court. The best part was the coach didn't finish, so I got another day off tomorrow. Never mind that
the day after they would arm me with a racket before unleashing me on the rest of the class.
I was glad to leave campus, so I would be free to pout and mope before I went out tonight with Jessica
and company. But right after I walked in the door of Charlie's house, Jessica called to cancel our plans. I
tried to be happy that Mike had asked her (<font color='blue'><b>Jessica</b></font>) out to dinner  I really was relieved that he (<font color='blue'><b>Mike</b></font>) finally seemed to
be catching on  but my enthusiasm sounded false in my own ears. She (<font color='blue'><b>Jessica</b></font>) rescheduled our shopping trip
for tomorrow night.
Which left me with little in the way of distractions. I had fish marinating for dinner, with a salad and bread
left over from the night before, so there was nothing to do there. I spent a focused half hour on
homework, but then I was through with that, too. I checked my e-mail, reading the backlog of letters
from my mother, getting snippier as they progressed to the present. I sighed and typed a quick response.

<p/>Mom,
Sorry. I've been out. I went to the beach with some friends. And I had to write a paper.

<p/>My excuses were fairly pathetic, so I gave up on that.

<p/>It's sunny outside today - I know, I'm shocked, too - so I'm going to go outside and soak up
as much vitamin D as I can. I love you,
Bella.

<p/>I decided to kill an hour with non-school-related reading. I had a small collection of books that came
with me to Forks, the shabbiest volume being a compilation of the works of Jane Austen. I selected that
one and headed to the backyard, grabbing a ragged old quilt from the linen cupboard at the top of the
stairs on my way down.
Outside in Charlie's small, square yard, I folded the quilt in half and laid it out of the reach of the trees'
shadows on the thick lawn that would always be slightly wet, no matter how long the sun shone. I lay on
my stomach, crossing my ankles in the air, flipping through the different novels in the book, trying to
decide which would occupy my mind the most thoroughly. My favorites were Pride and Prejudice and
Sense and Sensibility. I'd read the first most recently, so I started into Sense and Sensibility, only to
remember after I began three that the hero of the story happened to be named Edward. Angrily, I turned
to Mansfield Park, but the hero of that piece was named Edmund, and that was just too close. Weren't

<p/>there any other names available in the late eighteenth century? I snapped the book shut, annoyed, and
rolled over onto my back. I pushed my sleeves up as high as they would go, and closed my eyes. I would
think of nothing but the warmth on my skin, I told myself severely. The breeze was still light, but it blew
tendrils of my hair around my face, and that tickled a bit. I pulled all my hair over my head, letting it fan
out on the quilt above me, and focused again on the heat that touched my eyelids, my cheekbones, my
nose, my lips, my forearms, my neck, soaked through my light shirt
The next thing I was conscious of was the sound of Charlie's cruiser turning onto the bricks of the
driveway. I sat up in surprise, realizing the light was gone, behind the trees, and I had fallen asleep. I
looked around, muddled, with the sudden feeling that I wasn't alone.
<div class="bookquote">``Charlie?''  (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div>I asked. But I could hear his (<font color='blue'><b>Charlie</b></font>) door slamming in front of the house.
I jumped up, foolishly edgy, gathering the now-damp quilt and my book. I ran inside to get some oil
heating on the stove, realizing that dinner would be late. Charlie was hanging up his (<font color='blue'><b>Charlie</b></font>) gun belt and stepping
out of his (<font color='blue'><b>Charlie</b></font>) boots when I came in.
<div class="bookquote">``Sorry, Dad, dinner's not ready yet  I fell asleep outside.''  (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div>I stifled a yawn.
<div class="bookquote">``Don't worry about it,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Charlie</b></font>) said. <div class="bookquote">``I wanted to catch the score on the game, anyway.''
 (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div>I watched TV with Charlie after dinner, for something to do. There wasn't anything on I wanted to watch,
but he (<font color='blue'><b>Charlie</b></font>) knew I didn't like baseball, so he (<font color='blue'><b>Charlie</b></font>) turned it to some mindless sitcom that neither of us enjoyed. He (<font color='blue'><b>Charlie</b></font>)
seemed happy, though, to be doing something together. And it felt good, despite my depression, to make
him (<font color='blue'><b>Charlie</b></font>) happy.
<div class="bookquote">``Dad,''  (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div>I said during a commercial, <div class="bookquote">``Jessica and Angela are going to look at dresses for the dance
tomorrow night in Port Angeles, and they wanted me to help them choose do you mind if I go with
them?''
 (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``Jessica Stanley?''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Charlie</b></font>) asked.
<div class="bookquote">``And Angela Weber.''  (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div>I sighed as I gave him (<font color='blue'><b>Charlie</b></font>) the details.
He (<font color='blue'><b>Charlie</b></font>) was confused. <div class="bookquote">``But you're not going to the dance, right?''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``No, Dad, but I'm helping them find dresses  you know, giving them constructive criticism.''  (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div>I wouldn't
have to explain this to a woman.
<div class="bookquote">``Well, okay.''  (<font color='red'><b>He</b></font>)</div>He (<font color='blue'><b>Charlie</b></font>) seemed to realize that he (<font color='blue'><b>Charlie</b></font>) was out of his (<font color='blue'><b>Charlie</b></font>) depth with the girlie stuff. <div class="bookquote">``It's a school night,
though.''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``We'll leave right after school, so we can get back early. You'll be okay for dinner, right?''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``Bells, I fed myself for seventeen years before you got here,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Charlie</b></font>) reminded me.
<div class="bookquote">``I don't know how you survived,''  (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div>I muttered, then added more clearly, <div class="bookquote">``I'll leave some things for cold-cut
sandwiches in the fridge, okay? Right on top.''
 (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div>It was sunny again in the morning. I awakened with renewed hope that I grimly tried to suppress. I
dressed for the warmer weather in a deep blue V-neck blouse  something I'd worn in the dead of
winter in Phoenix.
I had planned my arrival at school so that I barely had time to make it to class. With a sinking heart, I

<p/>circled the full lot looking for a space, while also searching for the silver Volvo that was clearly not there.
I parked in the last row and hurried to English, arriving breathless, but subdued, before the final bell.
It was the same as yesterday  I just couldn't keep little sprouts of hope from budding in my mind, only
to have them squashed painfully as I searched the lunchroom in vain and sat at my empty Biology table.
The Port Angeles scheme was back on again for tonight and made all the more attractive by the fact that
Lauren had other obligations. I was anxious to get out of town so I could stop glancing over my shoulder,
hoping to see him (<font color='blue'><b>my</b></font>) appearing out of the blue the way he (<font color='blue'><b>my</b></font>) always did. I vowed to myself that I would be in a
good mood tonight and not ruin Angela's or Jessica's enjoyment in the dress hunting. Maybe I could do a
little clothes shopping as well. I refused to think that I might be shopping alone in Seattle this weekend,
no longer interested in the earlier arrangement. Surely he (<font color='blue'><b>my</b></font>) wouldn't cancel without at least telling me.
After school, Jessica followed me home in her (<font color='blue'><b>Jessica</b></font>) old white Mercury so that I could ditch my books and
truck. I brushed through my hair quickly when I was inside, feeling a slight lift of excitement as I
contemplated getting out of Forks. I left a note for Charlie on the table, explaining again where to find
dinner, switched my scruffy wallet from my school bag to a purse I rarely used, and ran out to join
Jessica. We went to Angela's house next, and she (<font color='blue'><b>Angela</b></font>) was waiting for us. My excitement increased
exponentially as we actually drove out of the town limits.

<p/>8. PORT ANGELES

<p/>Jess drove faster than the Chief, so we made it to Port Angeles by four. It had been a while since I'd had
a girls' night out, and the estrogen rush was invigorating. We listened to whiny rock songs while Jessica
jabbered on about the boys we hung out with. Jessica's dinner with Mike had gone very well, and she (<font color='blue'><b>Jessica</b></font>)
was hoping that by Saturday night they would have progressed to the first-kiss stage. I smiled to myself,
pleased. Angela was passively happy to be going to the dance, but not really interested in Eric. Jess tried
to get her (<font color='blue'><b>Jess</b></font>) to confess who her (<font color='blue'><b>Jess</b></font>) type was, but I interrupted with a question about dresses after a bit, to
spare her (<font color='blue'><b>Jess</b></font>). Angela threw a grateful glance my way.
Port Angeles was a beautiful little tourist trap, much more polished and quaint than Forks. But Jessica
and Angela knew it well, so they didn't plan to waste time on the picturesque boardwalk by the bay. Jess
drove straight to the one big department store in town, which was a few streets in from the bay area's
visitor-friendly face.
The dance was billed as semiformal, and we weren't exactly sure what that meant. Both Jessica and
Angela seemed surprised and almost disbelieving when I told them I'd never been to a dance in Phoenix.
<div class="bookquote">``Didn't you ever go with a boyfriend or something?''  (<font color='red'><b>Jess</b></font>)</div>Jess asked dubiously as we walked through the front
doors of the store.
<div class="bookquote">``Really,''  (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div>I tried to convince her (<font color='blue'><b>Jess</b></font>), not wanting to confess my dancing problems. <div class="bookquote">``I've never had a boyfriend
or anything close. I didn't go out much.''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``Why not?''  (<font color='red'><b>Jessica</b></font>)</div>Jessica demanded.
<div class="bookquote">``No one asked me,''  (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div>I answered honestly.
She (<font color='blue'><b>Jessica</b></font>) looked skeptical. <div class="bookquote">``People ask you out here,''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Jessica</b></font>) reminded me, <div class="bookquote">``and you tell them no.''  (<font color='red'><b>me</b></font>)</div>We were in
the juniors' section now, scanning the racks for dress-up clothes.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Well, except for Tyler,''  (<font color='red'><b>Angela</b></font>)</div>Angela amended quietly.
<div class="bookquote">``Excuse me?''  (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div>I gasped. <div class="bookquote">``What did you say?''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``Tyler told everyone he (<font color='blue'><b>Tyler</b></font>)'s taking you to prom,''  (<font color='red'><b>Jessica</b></font>)</div>Jessica informed me with suspicious eyes.
<div class="bookquote">``He (<font color='blue'><b>Tyler</b></font>) said what?''  (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div>I sounded like I was choking.
<div class="bookquote">``I told you it wasn't true,''  (<font color='red'><b>Angela</b></font>)</div>Angela murmured to Jessica.
I was silent, still lost in shock that was quickly turning to irritation. But we had found the dress racks, and
now we had work to do.
<div class="bookquote">``That's why Lauren doesn't like you,''  (<font color='red'><b>Jessica</b></font>)</div>Jessica giggled while we pawed through the clothes.
I ground my teeth. <div class="bookquote">``Do you think that if I ran him (<font color='blue'><b>Tyler</b></font>) over with my truck he (<font color='blue'><b>Tyler</b></font>) would stop feeling guilty about
the accident? That he (<font color='blue'><b>Tyler</b></font>) might give up on making amends and call it even?''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``Maybe,''  (<font color='red'><b>Jess</b></font>)</div>Jess snickered. '<div class="bookquote">``If that's why he (<font color='blue'><b>Tyler</b></font>)'s doing this.''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>The dress selection wasn't large, but both of them found a few things to try on. I sat on a low chair just
inside the dressing room, by the three-way mirror, trying to control my fuming.
Jess was torn between two  one a long, strapless, basic black number, the other a knee-length electric
blue with spaghetti straps. I encouraged her (<font color='blue'><b>Jess</b></font>) to go with the blue; why not play up the eyes? Angela chose
a pale pink dress that draped around her (<font color='blue'><b>Angela</b></font>) tall frame nicely and brought out honey tints in her (<font color='blue'><b>Angela</b></font>) light brown
hair. I complimented them both generously and helped by returning the rejects to their racks. The whole
process was much shorter and easier than similar trips I'd taken with Rene at home. I guess there was
something to be said for limited choices.
We headed over to shoes and accessories. While they tried things on I merely watched and critiqued, not
in the mood to shop for myself, though I did need new shoes. The girls'-night high was wearing off in the
wake of my annoyance at Tyler, leaving room for the gloom to move back in.
<div class="bookquote">``Angela?''  (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div>I began, hesitant, while she (<font color='blue'><b>I</b></font>) was trying on a pair of pink strappy heels  she (<font color='blue'><b>I</b></font>) was overjoyed to
have a date tall enough that she (<font color='blue'><b>I</b></font>) could wear high heels at all.
Jessica had drifted to the jewelry counter and we were alone.
<div class="bookquote">``Yes?''  (<font color='red'><b>She</b></font>)</div>She (<font color='blue'><b>Jessica</b></font>) held her (<font color='blue'><b>Jessica</b></font>) leg out, twisting her (<font color='blue'><b>Jessica</b></font>) ankle to get a better view of the shoe.
I chickened out. <div class="bookquote">``I like those.''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``I think I'll get them  though they'll never match anything but the one dress,''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Jessica</b></font>) mused.
<div class="bookquote">``Oh, go ahead  they're on sale,''  (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div>I encouraged. She (<font color='blue'><b>Jessica</b></font>) smiled, putting the lid back on a box that contained
more practical-looking off-white shoes.
I tried again. <div class="bookquote">``Um, Angela''  (<font color='red'><b>She</b></font>)</div>She (<font color='blue'><b>Jessica</b></font>) looked up curiously.
<div class="bookquote">``Is it normal for the Cullens''   (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div>I kept my eyes on the shoes  <div class="bookquote">``to be out of school a lot?''  (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div>I failed
miserably in my attempt to sound nonchalant.
<div class="bookquote">``Yes, when the weather is good they go backpacking all the time  even the doctor. They're all real
outdoorsy,''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Jessica</b></font>) told me quietly, examining her (<font color='blue'><b>Jessica</b></font>) shoes, too. She (<font color='blue'><b>Jessica</b></font>) didn't ask one question, let alone the

<p/>hundreds that Jessica would have unleashed. I was beginning to really like Angela.
<div class="bookquote">``Oh.''  (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div>I let the subject drop as Jessica returned to show us the rhinestone jewelry she (<font color='blue'><b>Jessica</b></font>)'d found to match
her (<font color='blue'><b>Jessica</b></font>) silver shoes.
We planned to go to dinner at a little Italian restaurant on the boardwalk, but the dress shopping hadn't
taken as long as we'd expected. Jess and Angela were going to take their clothes back to the car and
then walk down to the bay. I told them I would meet them at the restaurant in an hour  I wanted to
look for a bookstore. They were both willing to come with me, but I encouraged them to go have fun 
they didn't know how preoccupied I could get when surrounded by books; it was something I preferred
to do alone. They walked off to the car chattering happily, and I headed in the direction Jess pointed out.
I had no trouble finding the bookstore, but it wasn't what I was looking for. The windows were full of
crystals, dream-catchers, and books about spiritual healing. I didn't even go inside. Through the glass I
could see a fifty-year-old woman with long, gray hair worn straight down her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) back, clad in a dress right
out of the sixties, smiling welcomingly from behind the counter. I decided that was one conversation I
could skip. There had to be a normal bookstore in town.
I meandered through the streets, which were filling up with end-of-the-workday traffic, and hoped I was
headed toward downtown. I wasn't paying as much attention as I should to where I was going; I was
wrestling with despair. I was trying so hard not to think about him (<font color='blue'><b>I</b></font>), and what Angela had said and
more than anything trying to beat down my hopes for Saturday, fearing a disappointment more painful
than the rest, when I looked up to see someone's silver Volvo parked along the street and it all came
crashing down on me. Stupid, unreliable vampire, I thought to myself.
I stomped along in a southerly direction, toward some glass-fronted shops that looked promising. But
when I got to them, they were just a repair shop and a vacant space. I still had too much time to go
looking for Jess and Angela yet, and I definitely needed to get my mood in hand before I met back up
with them. I ran my fingers through my hair a couple of times and took some deep breaths before I
continued around the corner.
I started to realize, as I crossed another road, that I was going the wrong direction. The little foot traffic I
had seen was going north, and it looked like the buildings here were mostly warehouses. I decided to
turn east at the next corner, and then loop around after a few blocks and try my luck on a different street
on my way back to the boardwalk.
A group of four men turned around the corner I was heading for, dressed too casually to be heading
home from the office, but they were too grimy to be tourists. As they approached me, I realized they
weren't too many years older than I was. They were joking loudly among themselves, laughing raucously
and punching each other's arms. I scooted as far to the inside of the sidewalk as I could to give them
room, walking swiftly, looking past them to the corner.
<div class="bookquote">``Hey, there!''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>one of them called as they passed, and he (<font color='blue'><b>tourists</b></font>) had to be talking to me since no one else was
around. I glanced up automatically. Two of them had paused, the other two were slowing. The closest, a
heavyset, dark-haired man in his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) early twenties, seemed to be the one who had spoken. He (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) was wearing
a flannel shirt open over a dirty t-shirt, cut-off jeans, and sandals. He (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) took half a step toward me.
<div class="bookquote">``Hello,''  (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div>I mumbled, a knee-jerk reaction. Then I quickly looked away and walked faster toward the
corner. I could hear them laughing at full volume behind me.
<div class="bookquote">``Hey, wait!''  (<font color='red'><b>me</b></font>)</div>one of them called after me again, but I kept my head down and rounded the corner with a
sigh of relief. I could still hear them chortling behind me.

<p/>I found myself on a sidewalk leading past the backs of several somber-colored warehouses, each with
large bay doors for unloading trucks, padlocked for the night. The south side of the street had no
sidewalk, only a chain-link fence topped with barbed wire protecting some kind of engine parts storage
yard. I'd wandered far past the part of Port Angeles that I, as a guest, was intended to see. It was getting
dark, I realized, the clouds finally returning, piling up on the western horizon, creating an early sunset. The
eastern sky was still clear, but graying, shot through with streaks of pink and orange. I'd left my jacket in
the car, and a sudden shiver made me cross my arms tightly across my chest. A single van passed me,
and then the road was empty.
The sky suddenly darkened further, and, as I looked over my shoulder to glare at the offending cloud, I
realized with a shock that two men were walking quietly twenty feet behind me.
They were from the same group I'd passed at the corner, though neither was the dark one who'd spoken
to me. I turned my head forward at once, quickening my pace. A chill that had nothing to do with the
weather made me shiver again. My purse was on a shoulder strap and I had it slung across my body, the
way you were supposed to wear it so it wouldn't get snatched. I knew exactly where my pepper spray
was  still in my duffle bag under the bed, never unpacked. I didn't have much money with me, just a
twenty and some ones, and I thought about <div class="bookquote">``accidentally''  (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div>dropping my bag and walking away. But a
small, frightened voice in the back of my mind warned me that they might be something worse than
thieves.
I listened intently to their quiet footsteps, which were much too quiet when compared to the boisterous
noise they'd been making earlier, and it didn't sound like they were speeding up, or getting any closer to
me. Breathe, I had to remind myself. You don't know they're following you. I continued to walk as
quickly as I could without actually running, focusing on the right-hand turn that was only a few yards
away from me now. I could hear them, staying as far back as they'd been before. A blue car turned onto
the street from the south and drove quickly past me. I thought of jumping out in front of it, but I hesitated,
inhibited, unsure that I was really being pursued, and then it was too late.
I reached the corner, but a swift glance revealed that it was only a blind drive to the back of another
building. I was half-turned in anticipation; I had to hurriedly correct and dash across the narrow drive,
back to the sidewalk. The street ended at the next corner, where there was a stop sign. I concentrated
on the faint footsteps behind me, deciding whether or not to run. They sounded farther back, though, and
I knew they could outrun me in any case. I was sure to trip and go sprawling if I tried to go any faster.
The footfalls were definitely farther back. I risked a quick glance over my shoulder, and they were maybe
forty feet back now, I saw with relief. But they were both staring at me.
It seemed to take forever for me to get to the corner. I kept my pace steady, the men behind me falling
ever so slightly farther behind with every step. Maybe they realized they had scared me and were sorry. I
saw two cars going north pass the intersection I was heading for, and I exhaled in relief. There would be
more people around once I got off this deserted street. I skipped around the corner with a grateful sigh.
And skidded to a stop.
The street was lined on both sides by blank, doorless, windowless walls. I could see in the distance, two
intersections down, streetlamps, cars, and more pedestrians, but they were all too far away. Because
lounging against the western building, midway down the street, were the other two men from the group,
both watching with excited smiles as I froze dead on the sidewalk. I realized then that I wasn't being
followed.
I was being herded.

<p/>I paused for only a second, but it felt like a very long time. I turned then and darted to the other side of
the road. I had a sinking feeling that it was a wasted attempt. The footsteps behind me were louder now.
<div class="bookquote">``There you are!''  (<font color='red'><b>the man</b></font>)</div>The booming voice of the stocky, dark-haired man shattered the intense quiet and made
me jump. In the gathering darkness, it seemed like he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) was looking past me.
<div class="bookquote">``Yeah,''  (<font color='red'><b>me</b></font>)</div>a voice called loudly from behind me, making me jump again as I tried to hurry down the street.
<div class="bookquote">``We just took a little detour.''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>My steps had to slow now. I was closing the distance between myself and the lounging pair too quickly. I
had a good loud scream, and I sucked in air, preparing to use it, but my throat was so dry I wasn't sure
how much volume I could manage. With a quick movement I slipped my purse over my head, gripping
the strap with one hand, ready to surrender it or use it as weapon as need demanded.
The thickset man shrugged away from the wall as I warily came to a stop, and walked slowly into the
street.
<div class="bookquote">``Stay away from me,''  (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div>I warned in a voice that was supposed to sound strong and fearless. But I was
right about the dry throat  no volume.
<div class="bookquote">``Don't be like that, sugar,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) called, and the raucous laughter started again behind me.
I braced myself, feet apart, trying to remember through my panic what little self-defense I knew. Heel of
the hand thrust upward, hopefully breaking the nose or shoving it into the brain. Finger through the eye
socket  try to hook around and pop the eye out. And the standard knee to the groin, of course. That
same pessimistic voice in my mind spoke up then, reminding me that I probably wouldn't have a chance
against one of them, and there were four. Shut up! I commanded the voice before terror could
incapacitate me. I wasn't going out without taking someone with me. I tried to swallow so I could build
up a decent scream.
Headlights suddenly flew around the corner, the car almost hitting the stocky one, forcing him (<font color='blue'><b>I</b></font>) to jump
back toward the sidewalk. I dove into the road  this car was going to stop, or have to hit me. But the
silver car unexpectedly fishtailed around, skidding to a stop with the passenger door open just a few feet
from me.
<div class="bookquote">``Get in,''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>a furious voice commanded.
It was amazing how instantaneously the choking fear vanished, amazing how suddenly the feeling of
security washed over me  even before I was off the street  as soon as I heard his (<font color='blue'><b>passenger</b></font>) voice. I jumped
into the seat, slamming the door shut behind me.
It was dark in the car, no light had come on with the opening of the door, and I could barely see his (<font color='blue'><b>passenger</b></font>) face
in the glow from the dashboard. The tires squealed as he (<font color='blue'><b>passenger</b></font>) spun around to face north, accelerating too
quickly, swerving toward the stunned men on the street. I caught a glimpse of them diving for the
sidewalk as we straightened out and sped toward the harbor.
<div class="bookquote">``Put on your seat belt,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>passenger</b></font>) commanded, and I realized I was clutching the seat with both hands. I quickly
obeyed; the snap as the belt connected was loud in the darkness. He (<font color='blue'><b>passenger</b></font>) took a sharp left, racing forward,
blowing through several stop signs without a pause.
But I felt utterly safe and, for the moment, totally unconcerned about where we were going. I stared at his (<font color='blue'><b>passenger</b></font>)
face in profound relief, relief that went beyond my sudden deliverance. I studied his (<font color='blue'><b>passenger</b></font>) flawless features in
the limited light, waiting for my breath to return to normal, until it occurred to me that his (<font color='blue'><b>passenger</b></font>) expression was

<p/>murderously angry.
<div class="bookquote">``Are you okay?''  (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div>I asked, surprised at how hoarse my voice sounded.
<div class="bookquote">``No,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>passenger</b></font>) said curtly, and his (<font color='blue'><b>passenger</b></font>) tone was livid.
I sat in silence, watching his (<font color='blue'><b>passenger</b></font>) face while his (<font color='blue'><b>passenger</b></font>) blazing eyes stared straight ahead, until the car came to a
sudden stop. I glanced around, but it was too dark to see anything beside the vague outline of dark trees
crowding the roadside. We weren't in town anymore.
<div class="bookquote">``Bella?''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>passenger</b></font>) asked, his (<font color='blue'><b>passenger</b></font>) voice tight, controlled.
<div class="bookquote">``Yes?''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>My voice was still rough. I tried to clear my throat quietly.
<div class="bookquote">``Are you all right?''  (<font color='red'><b>He</b></font>)</div>He (<font color='blue'><b>passenger</b></font>) still didn't look at me, but the fury was plain on his (<font color='blue'><b>passenger</b></font>) face.
<div class="bookquote">``Yes,''  (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div>I croaked softly.
<div class="bookquote">``Distract me, please,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>passenger</b></font>) ordered.
<div class="bookquote">``I'm sorry, what?''
 (<font color='red'><b>He</b></font>)</div>He (<font color='blue'><b>passenger</b></font>) exhaled sharply.
<div class="bookquote">``Just prattle about something unimportant until I calm down,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>passenger</b></font>) clarified, closing his (<font color='blue'><b>passenger</b></font>) eyes and pinching
the bridge of his (<font color='blue'><b>passenger</b></font>) nose with his (<font color='blue'><b>passenger</b></font>) thumb and forefinger.
<div class="bookquote">``Um.''  (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div>I wracked my brain for something trivial. <div class="bookquote">``I'm going to run over Tyler Crowley tomorrow before
school?''
 (<font color='red'><b>He</b></font>)</div>He (<font color='blue'><b>passenger</b></font>) was still squeezing his (<font color='blue'><b>passenger</b></font>) eyes closed, but the corner of his (<font color='blue'><b>passenger</b></font>) mouth twitched.
<div class="bookquote">``Why?''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``He (<font color='blue'><b>Crowley</b></font>)'s telling everyone that he (<font color='blue'><b>Crowley</b></font>)'s taking me to prom  either he (<font color='blue'><b>Crowley</b></font>)'s insane or he (<font color='blue'><b>Crowley</b></font>)'s still trying to make up for
almost killing me last well, you remember it, and he (<font color='blue'><b>Crowley</b></font>) thinks prom is somehow the correct way to do
this. So I figure if I endanger his (<font color='blue'><b>Crowley</b></font>) life, then we're even, and he (<font color='blue'><b>Crowley</b></font>) can't keep trying to make amends. I don't
need enemies and maybe Lauren would back off if he (<font color='blue'><b>Crowley</b></font>) left me alone. I might have to total his (<font color='blue'><b>Crowley</b></font>) Sentra,
though. If he (<font color='blue'><b>Crowley</b></font>) doesn't have a ride he (<font color='blue'><b>Crowley</b></font>) can't take anyone to prom''  (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div>I babbled on.
<div class="bookquote">``I heard about that.''  (<font color='red'><b>He</b></font>)</div>He (<font color='blue'><b>passenger</b></font>) sounded a bit more composed.
<div class="bookquote">``You did?''  (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div>I asked in disbelief, my previous irritation flaring. <div class="bookquote">``If he (<font color='blue'><b>Crowley</b></font>)'s paralyzed from the neck down, he (<font color='blue'><b>Crowley</b></font>)
can't go to the prom, either,''  (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div>I muttered, refining my plan.
Edward sighed, and finally opened his (<font color='blue'><b>Edward</b></font>) eyes.
<div class="bookquote">``Better?''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``Not really.''
 (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div>I waited, but he (<font color='blue'><b>Edward</b></font>) didn't speak again. He (<font color='blue'><b>Edward</b></font>) leaned his (<font color='blue'><b>Edward</b></font>) head back against the seat, staring at the ceiling of the
car. His (<font color='blue'><b>Edward</b></font>) face was rigid.
<div class="bookquote">``What's wrong?''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>My voice came out in a whisper.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Sometimes I have a problem with my temper, Bella.''  (<font color='red'><b>He</b></font>)</div>He (<font color='blue'><b>Edward</b></font>) was whispering, too, and as he (<font color='blue'><b>Edward</b></font>) stared out the
window, his (<font color='blue'><b>Edward</b></font>) eyes narrowed into slits. <div class="bookquote">``But it wouldn't be helpful for me to turn around and hunt down
those''  (<font color='red'><b>He</b></font>)</div>He (<font color='blue'><b>Edward</b></font>) didn't finish his (<font color='blue'><b>Edward</b></font>) sentence, looking away, struggling for a moment to control his (<font color='blue'><b>Edward</b></font>) anger again.
<div class="bookquote">``At least,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Edward</b></font>) continued, <div class="bookquote">``that's what I'm trying to convince myself.''
 (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``Oh.''  (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div>The word seemed inadequate, but I couldn't think of a better response.
We sat in silence again. I glanced at the clock on the dashboard. It was past six-thirty.
<div class="bookquote">``Jessica and Angela will be worried,''  (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div>I murmured. <div class="bookquote">``I was supposed to meet them.''
 (<font color='red'><b>He</b></font>)</div>He (<font color='blue'><b>Edward</b></font>) started the engine without another word, turning around smoothly and speeding back toward town.
We were under the streetlights in no time at all, still going too fast, weaving with ease through the cars
slowly cruising the boardwalk. He (<font color='blue'><b>Edward</b></font>) parallel-parked against the curb in a space I would have thought much
too small for the Volvo, but he (<font color='blue'><b>Edward</b></font>) slid in effortlessly in one try. I looked out the window to see the lights of
La Bella Italia, and Jess and Angela just leaving, pacing anxiously away from us.
<div class="bookquote">``How did you know where ?''  (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div>I began, but then I just shook my head. I heard the door open and
turned to see him (<font color='blue'><b>Edward</b></font>) getting out.
<div class="bookquote">``What are you doing?''  (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div>I asked.
<div class="bookquote">``I'm taking you to dinner.''  (<font color='red'><b>He</b></font>)</div>He (<font color='blue'><b>Edward</b></font>) smiled slightly, but his (<font color='blue'><b>Edward</b></font>) eyes were hard. He (<font color='blue'><b>Edward</b></font>) stepped out of the car and
slammed the door. I fumbled with my seat belt, and then hurried to get out of the car as well. He (<font color='blue'><b>Edward</b></font>) was
waiting for me on the sidewalk.
He (<font color='blue'><b>Edward</b></font>) spoke before I could. <div class="bookquote">``Go stop Jessica and Angela before I have to track them down, too. I don't
think I could restrain myself if I ran into your other friends again.''
 (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div>I shivered at the threat in his (<font color='blue'><b>Edward</b></font>) voice.
<div class="bookquote">``Jess! Angela!''  (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div>I yelled after them, waving when they turned. They rushed back to me, the pronounced
relief on both their faces simultaneously changing to surprise as they saw who I was standing next to.
They hesitated a few feet from us.
<div class="bookquote">``Where have you been?''  (<font color='red'><b>Jessica</b></font>)</div>Jessica's voice was suspicious.
<div class="bookquote">``I got lost,''  (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div>I admitted sheepishly. <div class="bookquote">``And then I ran into Edward.''  (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div>I gestured toward him (<font color='blue'><b>Edward</b></font>).
<div class="bookquote">``Would it be all right if I joined you?''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Edward</b></font>) asked in his (<font color='blue'><b>Edward</b></font>) silken, irresistible voice. I could see from their
staggered expressions that he (<font color='blue'><b>Edward</b></font>) had never unleashed his (<font color='blue'><b>Edward</b></font>) talents on them before.
<div class="bookquote">``Er sure,''  (<font color='red'><b>Jessica</b></font>)</div>Jessica breathed.
<div class="bookquote">``Um, actually, Bella, we already ate while we were waiting  sorry,''  (<font color='red'><b>Angela</b></font>)</div>Angela confessed.
<div class="bookquote">``That's fine  I'm not hungry.''  (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div>I shrugged.
<div class="bookquote">``I think you should eat something.''  (<font color='red'><b>Edward/Edward Cullen/Cullen</b></font>)</div>Edward's voice was low, but full of authority. He (<font color='blue'><b>Edward</b></font>) looked up at Jessica
and spoke slightly louder. <div class="bookquote">``Do you mind if I drive Bella home tonight? That way you won't have to wait
while she (<font color='blue'><b>Bella</b></font>) eats.''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``Uh, no problem, I guess''  (<font color='red'><b>She</b></font>)</div>She (<font color='blue'><b>Jessica</b></font>) bit her (<font color='blue'><b>Jessica</b></font>) lip, trying to figure out from my expression whether that was
what I wanted. I winked at her (<font color='blue'><b>Jessica</b></font>). I wanted nothing more than to be alone with my perpetual savior. There
were so many questions that I couldn't bombard him (<font color='blue'><b>savior</b></font>) with till we were by ourselves.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Okay.''  (<font color='red'><b>Angela</b></font>)</div>Angela was quicker than Jessica. <div class="bookquote">``See you tomorrow, Bella Edward.''  (<font color='red'><b>She</b></font>)</div>She (<font color='blue'><b>Angela</b></font>) grabbed Jessica's
hand and pulled her (<font color='blue'><b>Jessica</b></font>) toward the car, which I could see a little ways away, parked across First Street. As
they got in, Jess turned and waved, her (<font color='blue'><b>Jess</b></font>) face eager with curiosity. I waved back, waiting for them to drive
away before I turned to face him (<font color='blue'><b>savior</b></font>).
<div class="bookquote">``Honestly, I'm not hungry,''  (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div>I insisted, looking up to scrutinize his (<font color='blue'><b>savior</b></font>) face. His (<font color='blue'><b>savior</b></font>) expression was unreadable.
<div class="bookquote">``Humor me.''
 (<font color='red'><b>He</b></font>)</div>He (<font color='blue'><b>savior</b></font>) walked to the door of the restaurant and held it open with an obstinate expression. Obviously, there
would be no further discussion. I walked past him (<font color='blue'><b>savior</b></font>) into the restaurant with a resigned sigh.
The restaurant wasn't crowded  it was the off-season in Port Angeles. The host was female, and I
understood the look in her (<font color='blue'><b>Jess</b></font>) eyes as she (<font color='blue'><b>Jess</b></font>) assessed Edward. She (<font color='blue'><b>Jess</b></font>) welcomed him (<font color='blue'><b>Edward</b></font>) a little more warmly than
necessary. I was surprised by how much that bothered me. She (<font color='blue'><b>Jess</b></font>) was several inches taller than I was, and
unnaturally blond.
<div class="bookquote">``A table for two?''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>His (<font color='blue'><b>Edward</b></font>) voice was alluring, whether he (<font color='blue'><b>Edward</b></font>) was aiming for that or not. I saw her (<font color='blue'><b>Jess</b></font>) eyes flicker to
me and then away, satisfied by my obvious ordinariness, and by the cautious, no-contact space Edward
kept between us. She (<font color='blue'><b>Jess</b></font>) led us to a table big enough for four in the center of the most crowded area of the
dining floor.
I was about to sit, but Edward shook his (<font color='blue'><b>Edward</b></font>) head at me.
<div class="bookquote">``Perhaps something more private?''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Edward</b></font>) insisted quietly to the host. I wasn't sure, but it looked like he (<font color='blue'><b>Edward</b></font>)
smoothly handed her (<font color='blue'><b>Jess</b></font>) a tip. I'd never seen anyone refuse a table except in old movies.
<div class="bookquote">``Sure.''  (<font color='red'><b>She</b></font>)</div>She (<font color='blue'><b>Jess</b></font>) sounded as surprised as I was. She (<font color='blue'><b>Jess</b></font>) turned and led us around a partition to a small ring of
booths  all of them empty. <div class="bookquote">``How's this?''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``Perfect.''  (<font color='red'><b>He</b></font>)</div>He (<font color='blue'><b>Edward</b></font>) flashed his (<font color='blue'><b>Edward</b></font>) gleaming smile, dazing her (<font color='blue'><b>Jess</b></font>) momentarily.
<div class="bookquote">``Um''   (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Jess</b></font>) shook her (<font color='blue'><b>Jess</b></font>) head, blinking  <div class="bookquote">``your server will be right out.''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>She (<font color='blue'><b>Jess</b></font>) walked away unsteadily.
<div class="bookquote">``You really shouldn't do that to people,''  (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div>I criticized. <div class="bookquote">``It's hardly fair.''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``Do what?''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``Dazzle them like that  she (<font color='blue'><b>Bella</b></font>)'s probably hyperventilating in the kitchen right now.''
 (<font color='red'><b>He</b></font>)</div>He (<font color='blue'><b>Edward</b></font>) seemed confused.
<div class="bookquote">``Oh, come on,''  (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div>I said dubiously. <div class="bookquote">``You have to know the effect you have on people.''
 (<font color='red'><b>He</b></font>)</div>He (<font color='blue'><b>Edward</b></font>) tilted his (<font color='blue'><b>Edward</b></font>) head to one side, and his (<font color='blue'><b>Edward</b></font>) eyes were curious. <div class="bookquote">``I dazzle people?''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``You haven't noticed? Do you think everybody gets their way so easily?''
 (<font color='red'><b>He</b></font>)</div>He (<font color='blue'><b>Edward</b></font>) ignored my questions. <div class="bookquote">``Do I dazzle you?''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``Frequently,''  (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div>I admitted.
And then our server arrived, her (<font color='blue'><b>Jess</b></font>) face expectant. The hostess had definitely dished behind the scenes, and
this new girl didn't look disappointed. She (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) flipped a strand of short black hair behind one ear and smiled
with unnecessary warmth.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Hello. My name is Amber, and I'll be your server tonight. What can I get you to drink?''  (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div>I didn't miss
that she (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) was speaking only to him (<font color='blue'><b>Edward</b></font>).
He (<font color='blue'><b>Edward</b></font>) looked at me.
<div class="bookquote">``I'll have a Coke.''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>It sounded like a question.
<div class="bookquote">``Two Cokes,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Edward</b></font>) said.
<div class="bookquote">``I'll be right back with that,''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) assured him (<font color='blue'><b>Edward</b></font>) with another unnecessary smile. But he (<font color='blue'><b>Edward</b></font>) didn't see it. He (<font color='blue'><b>Edward</b></font>) was
watching me.
<div class="bookquote">``What?''  (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div>I asked when she (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) left.
His (<font color='blue'><b>Edward</b></font>) eyes stayed fixed on my face. <div class="bookquote">``How are you feeling?''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``I'm fine,''  (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div>I replied, surprised by his (<font color='blue'><b>Edward</b></font>) intensity.
<div class="bookquote">``You don't feel dizzy, sick, cold ?''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``Should I?''
 (<font color='red'><b>He</b></font>)</div>He (<font color='blue'><b>Edward</b></font>) chuckled at my puzzled tone.
<div class="bookquote">``Well, I'm actually waiting for you to go into shock.''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>His (<font color='blue'><b>Edward</b></font>) face twisted up into that perfect crooked smile.
<div class="bookquote">``I don't think that will happen,''  (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div>I said after I could breathe again. <div class="bookquote">``I've always been very good at
repressing unpleasant things.''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``Just the same, I'll feel better when you have some sugar and food in you.''
 (<font color='red'><b>the waitress</b></font>)</div>Right on cue, the waitress appeared with our drinks and a basket of breadsticks. She (<font color='blue'><b>waitress</b></font>) stood with her (<font color='blue'><b>waitress</b></font>)
back to me as she (<font color='blue'><b>waitress</b></font>) placed them on the table.
<div class="bookquote">``Are you ready to order?''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>waitress</b></font>) asked Edward.
<div class="bookquote">``Bella?''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Edward</b></font>) asked. She (<font color='blue'><b>waitress</b></font>) turned unwillingly toward me.
I picked the first thing I saw on the menu. <div class="bookquote">``Um I'll have the mushroom ravioli.''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``And you?''  (<font color='red'><b>She</b></font>)</div>She (<font color='blue'><b>waitress</b></font>) turned back to him (<font color='blue'><b>Edward</b></font>) with a smile.
<div class="bookquote">``Nothing for me,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Edward</b></font>) said. Of course not.
<div class="bookquote">``Let me know if you change your mind.''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>The coy smile was still in place, but he (<font color='blue'><b>Edward</b></font>) wasn't looking at her (<font color='blue'><b>waitress</b></font>),
and she (<font color='blue'><b>waitress</b></font>) left dissatisfied.
<div class="bookquote">``Drink,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Edward</b></font>) ordered.
I sipped at my soda obediently, and then drank more deeply, surprised by how thirsty I was. I realized I
had finished the whole thing when he (<font color='blue'><b>Edward</b></font>) pushed his (<font color='blue'><b>Edward</b></font>) glass toward me.
<div class="bookquote">``Thanks,''  (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div>I muttered, still thirsty. The cold from the icy soda was radiating through my chest, and I
shivered.
<div class="bookquote">``Are you cold?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``It's just the Coke,''  (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div>I explained, shivering again.
<div class="bookquote">``Don't you have a jacket?''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>His (<font color='blue'><b>Edward</b></font>) voice was disapproving.
<div class="bookquote">``Yes.''  (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div>I looked at the empty bench next to me. <div class="bookquote">``Oh  I left it in Jessica's car,''  (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div>I realized.
Edward was shrugging out of his (<font color='blue'><b>Edward</b></font>) jacket. I suddenly realized that I had never once noticed what he (<font color='blue'><b>Edward</b></font>) was
wearing  not just tonight, but ever. I just couldn't seem to look away from his (<font color='blue'><b>Edward</b></font>) face. I made myself look
now, focusing. He (<font color='blue'><b>Edward</b></font>) was removing a light beige leather jacket now; underneath he (<font color='blue'><b>Edward</b></font>) wore an ivory turtleneck
sweater. It fit him (<font color='blue'><b>Edward</b></font>) snugly, emphasizing how muscular his (<font color='blue'><b>Edward</b></font>) chest was.
He (<font color='blue'><b>Edward</b></font>) handed me the jacket, interrupting my ogling.
<div class="bookquote">``Thanks,''  (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div>I said again, sliding my arms into his (<font color='blue'><b>Edward</b></font>) jacket. It was cold  the way my jacket felt when I first
picked it up in the morning, hanging in the drafty hallway. I shivered again. It smelled amazing. I inhaled,
trying to identify the delicious scent. It didn't smell like cologne. The sleeves were much too long; I
shoved them back so I could free my hands.
<div class="bookquote">``That color blue looks lovely with your skin,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Edward</b></font>) said, watching me. I was surprised; I looked down,
flushing, of course.
He (<font color='blue'><b>Edward</b></font>) pushed the bread basket toward me.
<div class="bookquote">``Really, I'm not going into shock,''  (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div>I protested.
<div class="bookquote">``You should be  a normal person would be. You don't even look shaken.''  (<font color='red'><b>He</b></font>)</div>He (<font color='blue'><b>Edward</b></font>) seemed unsettled. He (<font color='blue'><b>Edward</b></font>)
stared into my eyes, and I saw how light his (<font color='blue'><b>Edward</b></font>) eyes were, lighter than I'd ever seen them, golden
butterscotch.
<div class="bookquote">``I feel very safe with you,''  (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div>I confessed, mesmerized into telling the truth again.
That displeased him (<font color='blue'><b>Edward</b></font>); his (<font color='blue'><b>Edward</b></font>) alabaster brow furrowed. He (<font color='blue'><b>Edward</b></font>) shook his (<font color='blue'><b>Edward</b></font>) head, frowning.
<div class="bookquote">``This is more complicated than I'd planned,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Edward</b></font>) murmured to himself.
I picked up a breadstick and began nibbling on the end, measuring his (<font color='blue'><b>Edward</b></font>) expression. I wondered when it
would be okay to start questioning him (<font color='blue'><b>Edward</b></font>).
<div class="bookquote">``Usually you're in a better mood when your eyes are so light,''  (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div>I commented, trying to distract him (<font color='blue'><b>Edward</b></font>) from
whatever thought had left him (<font color='blue'><b>Edward</b></font>) frowning and somber.
He (<font color='blue'><b>Edward</b></font>) stared at me, stunned. <div class="bookquote">``What?''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``You're always crabbier when your eyes are black  I expect it then,''  (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div>I went on. <div class="bookquote">``I have a theory about
that.''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>His (<font color='blue'><b>Edward</b></font>) eyes narrowed. <div class="bookquote">``More theories?''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``Mm-hm.''  (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div>I chewed on a small bite of the bread, trying to look indifferent.
<div class="bookquote">``I hope you were more creative this time or are you still stealing from comic books?''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>His (<font color='blue'><b>Edward</b></font>) faint smile
was mocking; his (<font color='blue'><b>Edward</b></font>) eyes were still tight.
<div class="bookquote">``Well, no, I didn't get it from a comic book, but I didn't come up with it on my own, either,''  (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div>I confessed.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``And?''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Edward</b></font>) prompted.
But then the waitress strode around the partition with my food. I realized we'd been unconsciously
leaning toward each other across the table, because we both straightened up as she (<font color='blue'><b>waitress</b></font>) approached. She (<font color='blue'><b>waitress</b></font>) set
the dish in front of me  it looked pretty good  and turned quickly to Edward.
<div class="bookquote">``Did you change your mind?''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>waitress</b></font>) asked. <div class="bookquote">``Isn't there anything I can get you?''  (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div>I may have been imagining
the double meaning in her (<font color='blue'><b>waitress</b></font>) words.
<div class="bookquote">``No, thank you, but some more soda would be nice.''  (<font color='red'><b>He</b></font>)</div>He (<font color='blue'><b>Edward</b></font>) gestured with a long white hand to the empty
cups in front of me.
<div class="bookquote">``Sure.''  (<font color='red'><b>She</b></font>)</div>She (<font color='blue'><b>waitress</b></font>) removed the empty glasses and walked away.
<div class="bookquote">``You were saying?''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Edward</b></font>) asked.
<div class="bookquote">``I'll tell you about it in the car. If''  (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div>I paused.
<div class="bookquote">``There are conditions?''  (<font color='red'><b>He</b></font>)</div>He (<font color='blue'><b>Edward</b></font>) raised one eyebrow, his (<font color='blue'><b>Edward</b></font>) voice ominous.
<div class="bookquote">``I do have a few questions, of course.''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``Of course.''
 (<font color='red'><b>The waitress</b></font>)</div>The waitress was back with two more Cokes. She (<font color='blue'><b>waitress</b></font>) sat them down without a word this time, and left
again.
I took a sip.
<div class="bookquote">``Well, go ahead,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Edward</b></font>) pushed, his (<font color='blue'><b>Edward</b></font>) voice still hard.
I started with the most undemanding. Or so I thought. <div class="bookquote">``Why are you in Port Angeles?''
 (<font color='red'><b>He</b></font>)</div>He (<font color='blue'><b>Edward</b></font>) looked down, folding his (<font color='blue'><b>Edward</b></font>) large hands together slowly on the table. His (<font color='blue'><b>Edward</b></font>) eyes flickered up at me from
under his (<font color='blue'><b>Edward</b></font>) lashes, the hint of a smirk on his (<font color='blue'><b>Edward</b></font>) face.
<div class="bookquote">``Next.''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``But that's the easiest one,''  (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div>I objected.
<div class="bookquote">``Next,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Edward</b></font>) repeated.
I looked down, frustrated. I unrolled my silverware, picked up my fork, and carefully speared a ravioli. I
put it in my mouth slowly, still looking down, chewing while I thought. The mushrooms were good. I
swallowed and took another sip of Coke before I looked up.
<div class="bookquote">``Okay, then.''  (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div>I glared at him (<font color='blue'><b>Edward</b></font>), and continued slowly. <div class="bookquote">``Let's say, hypothetically of course, that
someone could know what people are thinking, read minds, you know  with a few exceptions.''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``Just one exception,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Edward</b></font>) corrected, <div class="bookquote">``hypothetically.''
 (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``All right, with one exception, then.''  (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div>I was thrilled that he (<font color='blue'><b>Edward</b></font>) was playing along, but I tried to seem casual.
<div class="bookquote">``How does that work? What are the limitations? How would that someone find someone else at
exactly the right time? How would he (<font color='blue'><b>someone</b></font>) know she (<font color='blue'><b>someone</b></font>) was in trouble?''  (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div>I wondered if my convoluted questions
even made sense.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Hypothetically?''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Edward</b></font>) asked.
<div class="bookquote">``Sure.''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``Well, if that someone''
 (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``Let's call him (<font color='blue'><b>someone</b></font>) `Joe,'''  (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div>I suggested.
He (<font color='blue'><b>Edward</b></font>) smiled wryly. <div class="bookquote">``Joe, then. If Joe had been paying attention, the timing wouldn't have needed to be quite
so exact.''  (<font color='red'><b>He</b></font>)</div>He (<font color='blue'><b>Edward</b></font>) shook his (<font color='blue'><b>Edward</b></font>) head, rolling his (<font color='blue'><b>Edward</b></font>) eyes. <div class="bookquote">``Only you could get into trouble in a town this small. You
would have devastated their crime rate statistics for a decade, you know.''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``We were speaking of a hypothetical case,''  (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div>I reminded him (<font color='blue'><b>Edward</b></font>) frostily.
He (<font color='blue'><b>Edward</b></font>) laughed at me, his (<font color='blue'><b>Edward</b></font>) eyes warm.
<div class="bookquote">``Yes, we were,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Edward</b></font>) agreed. <div class="bookquote">``Shall we call you `Jane'?''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``How did you know?''  (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div>I asked, unable to curb my intensity. I realized I was leaning toward him (<font color='blue'><b>Edward</b></font>) again.
He (<font color='blue'><b>Edward</b></font>) seemed to be wavering, torn by some internal dilemma. His (<font color='blue'><b>Edward</b></font>) eyes locked with mine, and I guessed he (<font color='blue'><b>Edward</b></font>)
was making the decision right then whether or not to simply tell me the truth.
<div class="bookquote">``You can trust me, you know,''  (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div>I murmured. I reached forward, without thinking, to touch his (<font color='blue'><b>Edward</b></font>) folded
hands, but he (<font color='blue'><b>Edward</b></font>) slid them away minutely, and I pulled my hand back.
<div class="bookquote">``I don't know if I have a choice anymore.''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>His (<font color='blue'><b>Edward</b></font>) voice was almost a whisper. <div class="bookquote">``I was wrong  you're much
more observant than I gave you credit for.''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``I thought you were always right.''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``I used to be.''  (<font color='red'><b>He</b></font>)</div>He (<font color='blue'><b>Edward</b></font>) shook his (<font color='blue'><b>Edward</b></font>) head again. <div class="bookquote">``I was wrong about you on one other thing, as well. You're not
a magnet for accidents  that's not a broad enough classification. You are a magnet for trouble. If there
is anything dangerous within a ten-mile radius, it will invariably find you.''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``And you put yourself into that category?''  (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div>I guessed.
His (<font color='blue'><b>Edward</b></font>) face turned cold, expressionless. <div class="bookquote">``Unequivocally.''
 (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div>I stretched my hand across the table again  ignoring him (<font color='blue'><b>Edward</b></font>) when he (<font color='blue'><b>Edward</b></font>) pulled back slightly once more  to
touch the back of his (<font color='blue'><b>Edward</b></font>) hand shyly with my fingertips. His (<font color='blue'><b>Edward</b></font>) skin was cold and hard, like a stone.
<div class="bookquote">``Thank you.''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>My voice was fervent with gratitude. <div class="bookquote">``That's twice now.''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>His (<font color='blue'><b>Edward</b></font>) face softened. <div class="bookquote">``Let's not try for three, agreed?''
 (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div>I scowled, but nodded. He (<font color='blue'><b>Edward</b></font>) moved his (<font color='blue'><b>Edward</b></font>) hand out from under mine, placing both of his (<font color='blue'><b>Edward</b></font>) under the table. But
he (<font color='blue'><b>Edward</b></font>) leaned toward me.
<div class="bookquote">``I followed you to Port Angeles,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Edward</b></font>) admitted, speaking in a rush. <div class="bookquote">``I've never tried to keep a specific
person alive before, and it's much more troublesome than I would have believed. But that's probably just
because it's you. Ordinary people seem to make it through the day without so many catastrophes.''  (<font color='red'><b>He</b></font>)</div>He (<font color='blue'><b>Edward</b></font>)
paused. I wondered if it should bother me that he (<font color='blue'><b>Edward</b></font>) was following me; instead I felt a strange surge of
pleasure. He (<font color='blue'><b>Edward</b></font>) stared, maybe wondering why my lips were curving into an involuntary smile.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Did you ever think that maybe my number was up the first time, with the van, and that you've been
interfering with fate?''  (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div>I speculated, distracting myself.
<div class="bookquote">``That wasn't the first time,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Edward</b></font>) said, and his (<font color='blue'><b>Edward</b></font>) voice was hard to hear. I stared at him (<font color='blue'><b>Edward</b></font>) in amazement, but he (<font color='blue'><b>Edward</b></font>)
was looking down. <div class="bookquote">``Your number was up the first time I met you.''
 (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div>I felt a spasm of fear at his (<font color='blue'><b>Edward</b></font>) words, and the abrupt memory of his (<font color='blue'><b>Edward</b></font>) violent black glare that first day but
the overwhelming sense of safety I felt in his (<font color='blue'><b>Edward</b></font>) presence stifled it. By the time he (<font color='blue'><b>Edward</b></font>) looked up to read my
eyes, there was no trace of fear in them.
<div class="bookquote">``You remember?''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Edward</b></font>) asked, his (<font color='blue'><b>Edward</b></font>) angel's face grave.
<div class="bookquote">``Yes.''  (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div>I was calm.
<div class="bookquote">``And yet here you sit.''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>There was a trace of disbelief in his (<font color='blue'><b>Edward</b></font>) voice; he (<font color='blue'><b>Edward</b></font>) raised one eyebrow.
<div class="bookquote">``Yes, here I sit because of you.''  (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div>I paused. <div class="bookquote">``Because somehow you knew how to find me today ?''  (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div>I
prompted.
He (<font color='blue'><b>Edward</b></font>) pressed his (<font color='blue'><b>Edward</b></font>) lips together, staring at me through narrowed eyes, deciding again. His (<font color='blue'><b>Edward</b></font>) eyes flashed down
to my full plate, and then back to me.
<div class="bookquote">``You eat, I'll talk,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Edward</b></font>) bargained.
I quickly scooped up another ravioli and popped it in my mouth.
<div class="bookquote">``It's harder than it should be  keeping track of you. Usually I can find someone very easily, once I've
heard their mind before.''  (<font color='red'><b>He</b></font>)</div>He (<font color='blue'><b>Edward</b></font>) looked at me anxiously, and I realized I had frozen. I made myself swallow,
then stabbed another ravioli and tossed it in.
<div class="bookquote">``I was keeping tabs on Jessica, not carefully  like I said, only you could find trouble in Port Angeles 
and at first I didn't notice when you took off on your own. Then, when I realized that you weren't with
her (<font color='blue'><b>Jessica</b></font>) anymore, I went looking for you at the bookstore I saw in her (<font color='blue'><b>Jessica</b></font>) head. I could tell that you hadn't gone
in, and that you'd gone south and I knew you would have to turn around soon. So I was just waiting
for you, randomly searching through the thoughts of people on the street  to see if anyone had noticed
you so I would know where you were. I had no reason to be worried but I was strangely anxious''
 (<font color='red'><b>He</b></font>)</div>He (<font color='blue'><b>Edward</b></font>) was lost in thought, staring past me, seeing things I couldn't imagine.
<div class="bookquote">``I started to drive in circles, still listening. The sun was finally setting, and I was about to get out and
follow you on foot. And then ''  (<font color='red'><b>He</b></font>)</div>He (<font color='blue'><b>Edward</b></font>) stopped, clenching his (<font color='blue'><b>Edward</b></font>) teeth together in sudden fury. He (<font color='blue'><b>Edward</b></font>) made an
effort to calm himself.
<div class="bookquote">``Then what?''  (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div>I whispered. He (<font color='blue'><b>Edward</b></font>) continued to stare over my head.
<div class="bookquote">``I heard what they were thinking,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Edward</b></font>) growled, his (<font color='blue'><b>Edward</b></font>) upper lip curling slightly back over his (<font color='blue'><b>Edward</b></font>) teeth. <div class="bookquote">``I saw
your face in his (<font color='blue'><b>you</b></font>) mind.''  (<font color='red'><b>He</b></font>)</div>He (<font color='blue'><b>Edward</b></font>) suddenly leaned forward, one elbow appearing on the table, his (<font color='blue'><b>Edward</b></font>) hand covering
his (<font color='blue'><b>Edward</b></font>) eyes. The movement was so swift it startled me.
<div class="bookquote">``It was very hard  you can't imagine how hard  for me to simply take you away, and leave
them alive.''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>His (<font color='blue'><b>Edward</b></font>) voice was muffled by his (<font color='blue'><b>Edward</b></font>) arm. <div class="bookquote">``I could have let you go with Jessica and Angela, but I
was afraid if you left me alone, I would go looking for them,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Edward</b></font>) admitted in a whisper.
I sat quietly, dazed, my thoughts incoherent. My hands were folded in my lap, and I was leaning weakly
against the back of the seat. He (<font color='blue'><b>Edward</b></font>) still had his (<font color='blue'><b>Edward</b></font>) face in his (<font color='blue'><b>Edward</b></font>) hand, and he (<font color='blue'><b>Edward</b></font>) was as still as if he (<font color='blue'><b>Edward</b></font>)'d been carved

<p/>from the stone his (<font color='blue'><b>Edward</b></font>) skin resembled.
Finally he (<font color='blue'><b>Edward</b></font>) looked up, his (<font color='blue'><b>Edward</b></font>) eyes seeking mine, full of his (<font color='blue'><b>Edward</b></font>) own questions.
<div class="bookquote">``Are you ready to go home?''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Edward</b></font>) asked.
<div class="bookquote">``I'm ready to leave,''  (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div>I qualified, overly grateful that we had the hour-long ride home together. I wasn't
ready to say goodbye to him (<font color='blue'><b>Edward</b></font>).
The waitress appeared as if she (<font color='blue'><b>waitress</b></font>)'d been called. Or watching.
<div class="bookquote">``How are we doing?''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>waitress</b></font>) asked Edward.
<div class="bookquote">``We're ready for the check, thank you.''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>His (<font color='blue'><b>Edward</b></font>) voice was quiet, rougher, still reflecting the strain of our
conversation. It seemed to muddle her (<font color='blue'><b>waitress</b></font>). He (<font color='blue'><b>Edward</b></font>) looked up, waiting.
<div class="bookquote">``S-sure,''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>waitress</b></font>) stuttered. <div class="bookquote">``Here you go.''  (<font color='red'><b>She</b></font>)</div>She (<font color='blue'><b>waitress</b></font>) pulled a small leather folder from the front pocket of her (<font color='blue'><b>waitress</b></font>)
black apron and handed it to him (<font color='blue'><b>Edward</b></font>).
There was a bill in his (<font color='blue'><b>Edward</b></font>) hand already. He (<font color='blue'><b>Edward</b></font>) slipped it into the folder and handed it right back to her (<font color='blue'><b>waitress</b></font>).
<div class="bookquote">``No change.''  (<font color='red'><b>He</b></font>)</div>He (<font color='blue'><b>Edward</b></font>) smiled. Then he (<font color='blue'><b>Edward</b></font>) stood up, and I scrambled awkwardly to my feet.
She (<font color='blue'><b>waitress</b></font>) smiled invitingly at him (<font color='blue'><b>Edward</b></font>) again. <div class="bookquote">``You have a nice evening.''
 (<font color='red'><b>He</b></font>)</div>He (<font color='blue'><b>Edward</b></font>) didn't look away from me as he (<font color='blue'><b>Edward</b></font>) thanked her (<font color='blue'><b>waitress</b></font>). I suppressed a smile.
He (<font color='blue'><b>Edward</b></font>) walked close beside me to the door, still careful not to touch me. I remembered what Jessica had
said about her (<font color='blue'><b>Jessica</b></font>) relationship with Mike, how they were almost to the first-kiss stage. I sighed. Edward
seemed to hear me, and he (<font color='blue'><b>Edward</b></font>) looked down curiously. I looked at the sidewalk, grateful that he (<font color='blue'><b>Edward</b></font>) didn't seem
to be able to know what I was thinking.
He (<font color='blue'><b>Edward</b></font>) opened the passenger door, holding it for me as I stepped in, shutting it softly behind me. I watched
him (<font color='blue'><b>Edward</b></font>) walk around the front of the car, amazed, yet again, by how graceful he (<font color='blue'><b>Edward</b></font>) was. I probably should have
been used to that by now  but I wasn't. I had a feeling Edward wasn't the kind of person anyone got
used to.
Once inside the car, he (<font color='blue'><b>Edward</b></font>) started the engine and turned the heater on high. It had gotten very cold, and I
guessed the good weather was at an end. I was warm in his (<font color='blue'><b>Edward</b></font>) jacket, though, breathing in the scent of it
when I thought he (<font color='blue'><b>Edward</b></font>) couldn't see.
Edward pulled out through the traffic, apparently without a glance, flipping around to head toward the
freeway.
<div class="bookquote">``Now,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Edward</b></font>) said significantly, <div class="bookquote">``it's your turn.''

 (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div><p/>9. THEORY

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Can I ask just one more?''  (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div>I pleaded as Edward accelerated much too quickly down the quiet street. He (<font color='blue'><b>Edward</b></font>)
didn't seem to be paying any attention to the road.
He (<font color='blue'><b>Edward</b></font>) sighed.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``One,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Edward</b></font>) agreed. His (<font color='blue'><b>Edward</b></font>) lips pressed together into a cautious line.
<div class="bookquote">``Well you said you knew I hadn't gone into the bookstore, and that I had gone south. I was just
wondering how you knew that.''
 (<font color='red'><b>He</b></font>)</div>He (<font color='blue'><b>Edward</b></font>) looked away, deliberating.
<div class="bookquote">``I thought we were past all the evasiveness,''  (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div>I grumbled.
He (<font color='blue'><b>Edward</b></font>) almost smiled.
<div class="bookquote">``Fine, then. I followed your scent.''  (<font color='red'><b>He</b></font>)</div>He (<font color='blue'><b>Edward</b></font>) looked at the road, giving me time to compose my face. I couldn't
think of an acceptable response to that, but I filed it carefully away for future study. I tried to refocus. I
wasn't ready to let him (<font color='blue'><b>Edward</b></font>) be finished, now that he (<font color='blue'><b>Edward</b></font>) was finally explaining things.
<div class="bookquote">``And then you didn't answer one of my first questions''  (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div>I stalled.
He (<font color='blue'><b>Edward</b></font>) looked at me with disapproval. <div class="bookquote">``Which one?''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``How does it work  the mind-reading thing? Can you read anybody's mind, anywhere? How do you
do it? Can the rest of your family ?''  (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div>I felt silly, asking for clarification on make-believe.
<div class="bookquote">``That's more than one,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Edward</b></font>) pointed out. I simply intertwined my fingers and gazed at him (<font color='blue'><b>Edward</b></font>), waiting.
<div class="bookquote">``No, it's just me. And I can't hear anyone, anywhere. I have to be fairly close. The more familiar
someone's `voice' is, the farther away I can hear them. But still, no more than a few miles.''  (<font color='red'><b>He</b></font>)</div>He (<font color='blue'><b>Edward</b></font>) paused
thoughtfully. ``It's a little like being in a huge hall filled with people, everyone talking at once. It's just a hum
 a buzzing of voices in the background. Until I focus on one voice, and then what they're thinking is
clear.
``Most of the time I tune it all out  it can be very distracting. And then it's easier to seem normal'' 
he (<font color='blue'><b>Edward</b></font>) frowned as he (<font color='blue'><b>Edward</b></font>) said the word  ``when I'm not accidentally answering someone's thoughts rather than
their words.''
``Why do you think you can't hear me?'' I asked curiously.
He (<font color='blue'><b>Edward</b></font>) looked at me, his (<font color='blue'><b>Edward</b></font>) eyes enigmatic.
``I don't know,'' he (<font color='blue'><b>Edward</b></font>) murmured. ``The only guess I have is that maybe your mind doesn't work the same
way the rest of theirs do. Like your thoughts are on the AM frequency and I'm only getting FM.'' He (<font color='blue'><b>Edward</b></font>)
grinned at me, suddenly amused.
``My mind doesn't work right? I'm a freak?'' The words bothered me more than they should  probably
because his (<font color='blue'><b>Edward</b></font>) speculation hit home. I'd always suspected as much, and it embarrassed me to have it
confirmed.
``I hear voices in my mind and you're worried that you're the freak,'' he (<font color='blue'><b>Edward</b></font>) laughed. ``Don't worry, it's just a
theory'' His (<font color='blue'><b>Edward</b></font>) face tightened. ``Which brings us back to you.''
I sighed. How to begin?
<div class="bookquote">``Aren't we past all the evasions now?''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Edward</b></font>) reminded me softly.
I looked away from his (<font color='blue'><b>Edward</b></font>) face for the first time, trying to find words. I happened to notice the speedometer.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Holy crow!''  (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div>I shouted. <div class="bookquote">``Slow down!''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``What's wrong?''  (<font color='red'><b>He</b></font>)</div>He (<font color='blue'><b>Edward</b></font>) was startled. But the car didn't decelerate.
<div class="bookquote">``You're going a hundred miles an hour!''  (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div>I was still shouting. I shot a panicky glance out the window, but
it was too dark to see much. The road was only visible in the long patch of bluish brightness from the
headlights. The forest along both sides of the road was like a black wall  as hard as a wall of steel if
we veered off the road at this speed.
<div class="bookquote">``Relax, Bella.''  (<font color='red'><b>He</b></font>)</div>He (<font color='blue'><b>Edward</b></font>) rolled his (<font color='blue'><b>Edward</b></font>) eyes, still not slowing.
<div class="bookquote">``Are you trying to kill us?''  (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div>I demanded.
<div class="bookquote">``We're not going to crash.''
 (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div>I tried to modulate my voice. <div class="bookquote">``Why are you in such a hurry?''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``I always drive like this.''  (<font color='red'><b>He</b></font>)</div>He (<font color='blue'><b>Edward</b></font>) turned to smile crookedly at me.
<div class="bookquote">``Keep your eyes on the road!''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``I've never been in an accident, Bella  I've never even gotten a ticket.''  (<font color='red'><b>He</b></font>)</div>He (<font color='blue'><b>Edward</b></font>) grinned and tapped his (<font color='blue'><b>Edward</b></font>)
forehead. <div class="bookquote">``Built-in radar detector.''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``Very funny.''  (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div>I fumed. <div class="bookquote">``Charlie's a cop, remember? I was raised to abide by traffic laws. Besides, if you
turn us into a Volvo pretzel around a tree trunk, you can probably just walk away.''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``Probably,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Edward</b></font>) agreed with a short, hard laugh. <div class="bookquote">``But you can't.''  (<font color='red'><b>He</b></font>)</div>He (<font color='blue'><b>Edward</b></font>) sighed, and I watched with relief as
the needle gradually drifted toward eighty. <div class="bookquote">``Happy?''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``Almost.''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``I hate driving slow,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Edward</b></font>) muttered.
<div class="bookquote">``This is slow?''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``Enough commentary on my driving,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Edward</b></font>) snapped. <div class="bookquote">``I'm still waiting for your latest theory.''
 (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div>I bit my lip. He (<font color='blue'><b>Edward</b></font>) looked down at me, his (<font color='blue'><b>Edward</b></font>) honey eyes unexpectedly gentle.
<div class="bookquote">``I won't laugh,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Edward</b></font>) promised.
<div class="bookquote">``I'm more afraid that you'll be angry with me.''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``Is it that bad?''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``Pretty much, yeah.''
 (<font color='red'><b>He</b></font>)</div>He (<font color='blue'><b>Edward</b></font>) waited. I was looking down at my hands, so I couldn't see his (<font color='blue'><b>Edward</b></font>) expression.
<div class="bookquote">``Go ahead.''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>His (<font color='blue'><b>Edward</b></font>) voice was calm.
<div class="bookquote">``I don't know how to start,''  (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div>I admitted.
<div class="bookquote">``Why don't you start at the beginning you said you didn't come up with this on your own.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``No.''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``What got you started  a book? A movie?''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Edward</b></font>) probed.
<div class="bookquote">``No  it was Saturday, at the beach.''  (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div>I risked a glance up at his (<font color='blue'><b>Edward</b></font>) face. He (<font color='blue'><b>Edward</b></font>) looked puzzled.
<div class="bookquote">``I ran into an old family friend Jacob Black,''  (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div>I continued. <div class="bookquote">``His (<font color='blue'><b>Black</b></font>) dad and Charlie have been friends since
I was a baby.''
 (<font color='red'><b>He</b></font>)</div>He (<font color='blue'><b>Edward</b></font>) still looked confused.
<div class="bookquote">``His (<font color='blue'><b>Black</b></font>) dad is one of the Quileute elders.''  (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div>I watched him (<font color='blue'><b>Edward</b></font>) carefully. His (<font color='blue'><b>Edward</b></font>) confused expression froze in place.
<div class="bookquote">``We went for a walk ''  (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div>I edited all my scheming out of the story <div class="bookquote">'' and he (<font color='blue'><b>Edward</b></font>) was telling me some old
legends  trying to scare me, I think. He (<font color='blue'><b>Edward</b></font>) told me one''  (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div>I hesitated.
<div class="bookquote">``Go on,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Edward</b></font>) said.
<div class="bookquote">``About vampires.''  (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div>I realized I was whispering. I couldn't look at his (<font color='blue'><b>Edward</b></font>) face now. But I saw his (<font color='blue'><b>Edward</b></font>) knuckles
tighten convulsively on the wheel.
<div class="bookquote">``And you immediately thought of me?''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>Still calm.
<div class="bookquote">``No. He (<font color='blue'><b>Black</b></font>) mentioned your family.''
 (<font color='red'><b>He</b></font>)</div>He (<font color='blue'><b>Edward</b></font>) was silent, staring at the road.
I was worried suddenly, worried about protecting Jacob.
<div class="bookquote">``He (<font color='blue'><b>Black</b></font>) just thought it was a silly superstition,''  (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div>I said quickly. <div class="bookquote">``He (<font color='blue'><b>Black</b></font>) didn't expect me to think anything of it.''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>It
didn't seem like enough; I had to confess. <div class="bookquote">``It was my fault, I forced him (<font color='blue'><b>Black</b></font>) to tell me.''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``Why?''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``Lauren said something about you  she (<font color='blue'><b>Lauren</b></font>) was trying to provoke me. And an older boy from the tribe
said your family didn't come to the reservation, only it sounded like he (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>) meant something different. So I
got Jacob alone and I tricked it out of him (<font color='blue'><b>Jacob</b></font>),''  (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div>I admitted, hanging my head.
He (<font color='blue'><b>Jacob</b></font>) startled me by laughing. I glared up at him (<font color='blue'><b>Jacob</b></font>). He (<font color='blue'><b>Jacob</b></font>) was laughing, but his (<font color='blue'><b>Jacob</b></font>) eyes were fierce, staring ahead.
<div class="bookquote">``Tricked him (<font color='blue'><b>Jacob</b></font>) how?''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Jacob</b></font>) asked.
<div class="bookquote">``I tried to flirt  it worked better than I thought it would.''  (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div>Disbelief colored my tone as I remembered.
<div class="bookquote">``I'd like to have seen that.''  (<font color='red'><b>He</b></font>)</div>He (<font color='blue'><b>Jacob</b></font>) chuckled darkly. <div class="bookquote">``And you accused me of dazzling people  poor Jacob
Black.''
 (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div>I blushed and looked out my window into the night.
<div class="bookquote">``What did you do then?''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Jacob</b></font>) asked after a minute.
<div class="bookquote">``I did some research on the Internet.''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``And did that convince you?''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>His (<font color='blue'><b>Jacob</b></font>) voice sounded barely interested. But his (<font color='blue'><b>Jacob</b></font>) hands were clamped hard
onto the steering wheel.
<div class="bookquote">``No. Nothing fit. Most of it was kind of silly. And then''  (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div>I stopped.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``What?''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``I decided it didn't matter,''  (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div>I whispered.
<div class="bookquote">``It didn't matter?''  (<font color='red'><b>me</b></font>)</div>His (<font color='blue'><b>Jacob</b></font>) tone made me look up  I had finally broken through his (<font color='blue'><b>Jacob</b></font>) carefully composed
mask. His (<font color='blue'><b>Jacob</b></font>) face was incredulous, with just a hint of the anger I'd feared.
<div class="bookquote">``No,''  (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div>I said softly. <div class="bookquote">``It doesn't matter to me what you are.''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>A hard, mocking edge entered his (<font color='blue'><b>Jacob</b></font>) voice. <div class="bookquote">``You don't care if I'm a monster? If I'm not human!''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``No.''
 (<font color='red'><b>He</b></font>)</div>He (<font color='blue'><b>Jacob</b></font>) was silent, staring straight ahead again. His (<font color='blue'><b>Jacob</b></font>) face was bleak and cold.
<div class="bookquote">``You're angry,''  (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div>I sighed. <div class="bookquote">``I shouldn't have said anything.''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``No,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Jacob</b></font>) said, but his (<font color='blue'><b>Jacob</b></font>) tone was as hard as his (<font color='blue'><b>Jacob</b></font>) face. <div class="bookquote">``I'd rather know what you're thinking  even if what
you're thinking is insane.''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``So I'm wrong again?''  (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div>I challenged.
``That's not what I was referring to. ``It doesn't matter'!'' he (<font color='blue'><b>Jacob</b></font>) quoted, gritting his (<font color='blue'><b>Jacob</b></font>) teeth together.
``I'm right?'' I gasped.
``Does it matter?''
I took a deep breath.
``Not really.'' I paused. ``But I am curious.'' My voice, at least, was composed.
He (<font color='blue'><b>Jacob</b></font>) was suddenly resigned. ``What are you curious about?''
``How old are you?''
``Seventeen,'' he (<font color='blue'><b>Jacob</b></font>) answered promptly.
``And how long have you been seventeen?''
His (<font color='blue'><b>Jacob</b></font>) lips twitched as he (<font color='blue'><b>Jacob</b></font>) stared at the road. ``A while,'' he (<font color='blue'><b>Jacob</b></font>) admitted at last.
``Okay.'' I smiled, pleased that he (<font color='blue'><b>Jacob</b></font>) was still being honest with me. He (<font color='blue'><b>Jacob</b></font>) stared down at me with watchful
eyes, much as he (<font color='blue'><b>Jacob</b></font>) had before, when he (<font color='blue'><b>Jacob</b></font>) was worried I would go into shock. I smiled wider in
encouragement, and he (<font color='blue'><b>Jacob</b></font>) frowned.
``Don't laugh  but how can you come out during the daytime?''
He (<font color='blue'><b>Jacob</b></font>) laughed anyway. ``Myth.''
``Burned by the sun?''
``Myth.''
``Sleeping in coffins?''
``Myth.'' He (<font color='blue'><b>Jacob</b></font>) hesitated for a moment, and a peculiar tone entered his (<font color='blue'><b>Jacob</b></font>) voice. <div class="bookquote">``I can't sleep.''

 (<font color='red'><b>me</b></font>)</div><p/>It took me a minute to absorb that. <div class="bookquote">``At all?''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``Never,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Jacob</b></font>) said, his (<font color='blue'><b>Jacob</b></font>) voice nearly inaudible. He (<font color='blue'><b>Jacob</b></font>) turned to look at me with a wistful expression. The
golden eyes held mine, and I lost my train of thought. I stared at him (<font color='blue'><b>Jacob</b></font>) until he (<font color='blue'><b>Jacob</b></font>) looked away.
<div class="bookquote">``You haven't asked me the most important question yet.''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>His (<font color='blue'><b>Jacob</b></font>) voice was hard now, and when he (<font color='blue'><b>Jacob</b></font>) looked
at me again his (<font color='blue'><b>Jacob</b></font>) eyes were cold.
I blinked, still dazed. <div class="bookquote">``Which one is that?''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``You aren't concerned about my diet?''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Jacob</b></font>) asked sarcastically.
<div class="bookquote">``Oh,''  (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div>I murmured, <div class="bookquote">``that.''
 (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``Yes, that.''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>His (<font color='blue'><b>Jacob</b></font>) voice was bleak. <div class="bookquote">``Don't you want to know if I drink blood?''
 (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div>I flinched. <div class="bookquote">``Well, Jacob said something about that.''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``What did Jacob say?''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Jacob</b></font>) asked flatly.
<div class="bookquote">``He (<font color='blue'><b>Jacob</b></font>) said you didn't hunt people. He (<font color='blue'><b>Jacob</b></font>) said your family wasn't supposed to be dangerous because you
only hunted animals.''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``He (<font color='blue'><b>Jacob</b></font>) said we weren't dangerous?''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>His (<font color='blue'><b>Jacob</b></font>) voice was deeply skeptical.
<div class="bookquote">``Not exactly. He (<font color='blue'><b>Jacob</b></font>) said you weren't supposed to be dangerous. But the Quileutes still didn't want you on
their land, just in case.''
 (<font color='red'><b>He</b></font>)</div>He (<font color='blue'><b>Jacob</b></font>) looked forward, but I couldn't tell if he (<font color='blue'><b>Jacob</b></font>) was watching the road or not.
<div class="bookquote">``So was he (<font color='blue'><b>Jacob</b></font>) right? About not hunting people?''  (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div>I tried to keep my voice as even as possible.
<div class="bookquote">``The Quileutes have a long memory,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Jacob</b></font>) whispered.
I took it as a confirmation.
<div class="bookquote">``Don't let that make you complacent, though,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Jacob</b></font>) warned me. <div class="bookquote">``They're right to keep their distance from
us. We are still dangerous.''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``I don't understand.''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``We try,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Jacob</b></font>) explained slowly. <div class="bookquote">``We're usually very good at what we do. Sometimes we make mistakes.
Me, for example, allowing myself to be alone with you.''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``This is a mistake?''  (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div>I heard the sadness in my voice, but I didn't know if he (<font color='blue'><b>Jacob</b></font>) could as well.
<div class="bookquote">``A very dangerous one,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Jacob</b></font>) murmured.
We were both silent then. I watched the headlights twist with the curves of the road. They moved too
fast; it didn't look real, it looked like a video game. I was aware of the time slipping away so quickly, like
the black road beneath us, and I was hideously afraid that I would never have another chance to be with
him (<font color='blue'><b>Jacob</b></font>) like this again  openly, the walls between us gone for once. His (<font color='blue'><b>Jacob</b></font>) words hinted at an end, and I
recoiled from the idea. I couldn't waste one minute I had with him (<font color='blue'><b>Jacob</b></font>).
<div class="bookquote">``Tell me more,''  (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div>I asked desperately, not caring what he (<font color='blue'><b>Jacob</b></font>) said, just so I could hear his (<font color='blue'><b>Jacob</b></font>) voice again.

<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Jacob</b></font>) looked at me quickly, startled by the change in my tone. <div class="bookquote">``What more do you want to know?''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``Tell me why you hunt animals instead of people,''  (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div>I suggested, my voice still tinged with desperation. I
realized my eyes were wet, and I fought against the grief that was trying to overpower me.
<div class="bookquote">``I don't want to be a monster.''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>His (<font color='blue'><b>Jacob</b></font>) voice was very low.
<div class="bookquote">``But animals aren't enough?''
 (<font color='red'><b>He</b></font>)</div>He (<font color='blue'><b>Jacob</b></font>) paused. <div class="bookquote">``I can't be sure, of course, but I'd compare it to living on tofu and soy milk; we call ourselves
vegetarians, our little inside joke. It doesn't completely satiate the hunger  or rather thirst. But it keens
us strong enough to resist. Most of the time.''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>His (<font color='blue'><b>Jacob</b></font>) tone turned ominous. <div class="bookquote">``Sometimes it's more difficult than
others.''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``Is it very difficult for you now?''  (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div>I asked.
He (<font color='blue'><b>Jacob</b></font>) sighed. <div class="bookquote">``Yes.''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``But you're not hungry now,''  (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div>I said confidently  stating, not asking.
<div class="bookquote">``Why do you think that?''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``Your eyes. I told you I had a theory. I've noticed that people  men in particular  are crabbier when
they're hungry.''
 (<font color='red'><b>He</b></font>)</div>He (<font color='blue'><b>Jacob</b></font>) chuckled. <div class="bookquote">``You are observant, aren't you?''
 (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div>I didn't answer; I just listened to the sound of his (<font color='blue'><b>Jacob</b></font>) laugh, committing it to memory.
<div class="bookquote">``Were you hunting this weekend, with Emmett?''  (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div>I asked when it was quiet again.
<div class="bookquote">``Yes.''  (<font color='red'><b>He</b></font>)</div>He (<font color='blue'><b>Jacob</b></font>) paused for a second, as if deciding whether or not to say something. <div class="bookquote">``I didn't want to leave,
but it was necessary. It's a bit easier to be around you when I'm not thirsty.''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``Why didn't you want to leave?''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``It makes me anxious to be away from you.''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>His (<font color='blue'><b>Jacob</b></font>) eyes were gentle but intense, and they seemed to
be making my bones turn soft. <div class="bookquote">``I wasn't joking when I asked you to try not to fall in the ocean or get run
over last Thursday. I was distracted all weekend, worrying about you. And after what happened tonight,
I'm surprised that you did make it through a whole weekend unscathed.''  (<font color='red'><b>He</b></font>)</div>He (<font color='blue'><b>Jacob</b></font>) shook his (<font color='blue'><b>Jacob</b></font>) head, and then
seemed to remember something. <div class="bookquote">``Well, not totally unscathed.''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``What?''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``Your hands,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Jacob</b></font>) reminded me. I looked down at my palms, at the almost-healed scrapes across the
heels of my hands. His (<font color='blue'><b>Jacob</b></font>) eyes missed nothing.
<div class="bookquote">``I fell,''  (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div>I sighed.
<div class="bookquote">``That's what I thought.''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>His (<font color='blue'><b>Jacob</b></font>) lips curved up at the corners. <div class="bookquote">``I suppose, being you, it could have been much
worse  and that possibility tormented me the entire time I was away. It was a very long three days. I
really got on Emmett's nerves.''  (<font color='red'><b>He</b></font>)</div>He (<font color='blue'><b>Jacob</b></font>) smiled ruefully at me.
<div class="bookquote">``Three days? Didn't you just get back today?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``No, we got back Sunday.''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``Then why weren't any of you in school?''  (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div>I was frustrated, almost angry as I thought of how much
disappointment I had suffered because of his (<font color='blue'><b>Jacob</b></font>) absence.
<div class="bookquote">``Well, you asked if the sun hurt me, and it doesn't. But I can't go out in the sunlight  at least, not where
anyone can see.''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``Why?''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``I'll show you sometime,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Jacob</b></font>) promised.
I thought about it for a moment.
<div class="bookquote">``You might have called me,''  (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div>I decided.
He (<font color='blue'><b>Jacob</b></font>) was puzzled. <div class="bookquote">``But I knew you were safe.''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``But I didn't know where you were. I ''  (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div>I hesitated, dropping my eyes.
<div class="bookquote">``What?''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>His (<font color='blue'><b>Jacob</b></font>) velvety voice was compelling.
<div class="bookquote">``I didn't like it. Not seeing you. It makes me anxious, too.''  (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div>I blushed to be saying this out loud.
He (<font color='blue'><b>Jacob</b></font>) was quiet. I glanced up, apprehensive, and saw that his (<font color='blue'><b>Jacob</b></font>) expression was pained.
<div class="bookquote">``Ah,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Jacob</b></font>) groaned quietly. <div class="bookquote">``This is wrong.''
 (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div>I couldn't understand his (<font color='blue'><b>Jacob</b></font>) response. <div class="bookquote">``What did I say?''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``Don't you see, Bella? It's one thing for me to make myself miserable, but a wholly other thing for you to
be so involved.''  (<font color='red'><b>He</b></font>)</div>He (<font color='blue'><b>Jacob</b></font>) turned his (<font color='blue'><b>Jacob</b></font>) anguished eyes to the road, his (<font color='blue'><b>Jacob</b></font>) words flowing almost too fast for me to
understand. <div class="bookquote">``I don't want to hear that you feel that way.''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>His (<font color='blue'><b>Jacob</b></font>) voice was low but urgent. His (<font color='blue'><b>Jacob</b></font>) words cut
me. <div class="bookquote">``It's wrong. It's not safe. I'm dangerous, Bella  please, grasp that.''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``No.''  (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div>I tried very hard not to look like a sulky child.
<div class="bookquote">``I'm serious,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Jacob</b></font>) growled.
<div class="bookquote">``So am I. I told you, it doesn't matter what you are. It's too late.''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>His (<font color='blue'><b>Jacob</b></font>) voice whipped out, low and harsh. <div class="bookquote">``Never say that.''
 (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div>I bit my lip and was glad he (<font color='blue'><b>Jacob</b></font>) couldn't know how much that hurt. I stared out at the road. We must be
close now. He (<font color='blue'><b>Jacob</b></font>) was driving much too fast.
<div class="bookquote">``What are you thinking?''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Jacob</b></font>) asked, his (<font color='blue'><b>Jacob</b></font>) voice still raw. I just shook my head, not sure if I could speak. I
could feel his (<font color='blue'><b>Jacob</b></font>) gaze on my face, but I kept my eyes forward.
<div class="bookquote">``Are you crying?''  (<font color='red'><b>He</b></font>)</div>He (<font color='blue'><b>Jacob</b></font>) sounded appalled. I hadn't realized the moisture in my eyes had brimmed over. I
quickly rubbed my hand across my cheek, and sure enough, traitor tears were there, betraying me.
<div class="bookquote">``No,''  (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div>I said, but my voice cracked.
I saw him (<font color='blue'><b>traitor</b></font>) reach toward me hesitantly with his (<font color='blue'><b>traitor</b></font>) right hand, but then he (<font color='blue'><b>traitor</b></font>) stopped and placed it slowly back
on the steering wheel.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``I'm sorry.''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>His (<font color='blue'><b>traitor</b></font>) voice burned with regret. I knew he (<font color='blue'><b>traitor</b></font>) wasn't just apologizing for the words that had upset
me.
The darkness slipped by us in silence.
<div class="bookquote">``Tell me something,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>traitor</b></font>) asked after another minute, and I could hear him (<font color='blue'><b>traitor</b></font>) struggle to use a lighter tone.
<div class="bookquote">``Yes?''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``What were you thinking tonight, just before I came around the corner? I couldn't understand your
expression  you didn't look that scared, you looked like you were concentrating very hard on
something.''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``I was trying to remember how to incapacitate an attacker  you know, self-defense. I was going to
smash his (<font color='blue'><b>attacker</b></font>) nose into his (<font color='blue'><b>attacker</b></font>) brain.''  (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div>I thought of the dark-haired man with a surge of hate.
<div class="bookquote">``You were going to fight them?''  (<font color='red'><b>him</b></font>)</div>This upset him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>). <div class="bookquote">``Didn't you think about running?''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``I fall down a lot when I run,''  (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div>I admitted.
<div class="bookquote">``What about screaming for help?''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``I was getting to that part.''
 (<font color='red'><b>He</b></font>)</div>He (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) shook his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) head. <div class="bookquote">``You were right  I'm definitely fighting fate trying to keep you alive.''
 (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div>I sighed. We were slowing, passing into the boundaries of Forks. It had taken less than twenty minutes.
<div class="bookquote">``Will I see you tomorrow?''  (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div>I demanded.
<div class="bookquote">``Yes  I have a paper due, too.''  (<font color='red'><b>He</b></font>)</div>He (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) smiled. <div class="bookquote">``I'll save you a seat at lunch.''
 (<font color='red'><b>me</b></font>)</div>It was silly, after everything we'd been through tonight, how that little promise sent flutters through my
stomach, and made me unable to speak.
We were in front of Charlie's house. The lights were on, my truck in its place, everything utterly normal. It
was like waking from a dream. He (<font color='blue'><b>Charlie</b></font>) stopped the car, but I didn't move.
<div class="bookquote">``Do you promise to be there tomorrow?''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``I promise.''
 (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div>I considered that for a moment, then nodded. I pulled his (<font color='blue'><b>Charlie</b></font>) jacket off, taking one last whiff.
<div class="bookquote">``You can keep it  you don't have a jacket for tomorrow,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Charlie</b></font>) reminded me.
I handed it back to him (<font color='blue'><b>Charlie</b></font>). <div class="bookquote">``I don't want to have to explain to Charlie.''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``Oh, right.''  (<font color='red'><b>He</b></font>)</div>He (<font color='blue'><b>Charlie</b></font>) grinned.
I hesitated, my hand on the door handle, trying to prolong the moment.
<div class="bookquote">``Bella?''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Charlie</b></font>) asked in a different tone  serious, but hesitant.
<div class="bookquote">``Yes?''  (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div>I turned back to him (<font color='blue'><b>Charlie</b></font>) too eagerly.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Will you promise me something?''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``Yes,''  (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div>I said, and instantly regretted my unconditional agreement. What if he (<font color='blue'><b>Charlie</b></font>) asked me to stay away from
him (<font color='blue'><b>Charlie</b></font>)? I couldn't keep that promise.
<div class="bookquote">``Don't go into the woods alone.''
 (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div>I stared at him (<font color='blue'><b>Charlie</b></font>) in blank confusion. <div class="bookquote">``Why?''
 (<font color='red'><b>He</b></font>)</div>He (<font color='blue'><b>Charlie</b></font>) frowned, and his (<font color='blue'><b>Charlie</b></font>) eyes were tight as he (<font color='blue'><b>Charlie</b></font>) stared past me out the window.
<div class="bookquote">``I'm not always the most dangerous thing out there. Let's leave it at that.''
 (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div>I shuddered slightly at the sudden bleakness in his (<font color='blue'><b>Charlie</b></font>) voice, but I was relieved. This, at least, was an easy
promise to honor. <div class="bookquote">``Whatever you say.''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``I'll see you tomorrow,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Charlie</b></font>) sighed, and I knew he (<font color='blue'><b>Charlie</b></font>) wanted me to leave now.
<div class="bookquote">``Tomorrow, then.''  (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div>I opened the door unwillingly.
<div class="bookquote">``Bella?''  (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div>I turned and he (<font color='blue'><b>Charlie</b></font>) was leaning toward me, his (<font color='blue'><b>Charlie</b></font>) pale, glorious face just inches from mine. My heart
stopped beating.
<div class="bookquote">``Sleep well,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Charlie</b></font>) said. His (<font color='blue'><b>Charlie</b></font>) breath blew in my face, stunning me. It was the same exquisite scent that clung
to his (<font color='blue'><b>Charlie</b></font>) jacket, but in a more concentrated form. I blinked, thoroughly dazed. He (<font color='blue'><b>Charlie</b></font>) leaned away.
I was unable to move until my brain had somewhat unscrambled itself. Then I stepped out of the car
awkwardly, having to use the frame for support. I thought I heard him (<font color='blue'><b>Charlie</b></font>) chuckle, but the sound was too
quiet for me to be certain.
He (<font color='blue'><b>Charlie</b></font>) waited till I had stumbled to the front door, and then I heard his (<font color='blue'><b>Charlie</b></font>) engine quietly rev. I turned to watch
the silver car disappear around the corner. I realized it was very cold.
I reached for the key mechanically, unlocked the door, and stepped inside.
Charlie called from the living room. <div class="bookquote">``Bella?''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``Yeah, Dad, it's me.''  (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div>I walked in to see him (<font color='blue'><b>Charlie</b></font>). He (<font color='blue'><b>Charlie</b></font>) was watching a baseball game.
<div class="bookquote">``You're home early.''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``Am I?''  (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div>I was surprised.
<div class="bookquote">``It's not even eight yet,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Charlie</b></font>) told me. <div class="bookquote">``Did you girls have fun?''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``Yeah  it was lots of fun.''  (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div>My head was spinning as I tried to remember all the way back to the girls'
night out I had planned. <div class="bookquote">``They both found dresses.''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``Are you all right?''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``I'm just tired. I did a lot of walking.''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``Well, maybe you should go lie down.''  (<font color='red'><b>He</b></font>)</div>He (<font color='blue'><b>Charlie</b></font>) sounded concerned. I wondered what my face looked like.
<div class="bookquote">``I'm just going to call Jessica first.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Weren't you just with her (<font color='blue'><b>Jessica</b></font>)?''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Charlie</b></font>) asked, surprised.
<div class="bookquote">``Yes  but I left my jacket in her (<font color='blue'><b>Jessica</b></font>) car. I want to make sure she (<font color='blue'><b>Jessica</b></font>) brings it tomorrow.''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``Well, give her (<font color='blue'><b>Jessica</b></font>) a chance to get home first.''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``Right,''  (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div>I agreed.
I went to the kitchen and fell, exhausted, into a chair. I was really feeling dizzy now. I wondered if I was
going to go into shock after all. Get a grip, I told myself.
The phone rang suddenly, startling me. I yanked it off the hook.
<div class="bookquote">``Hello?''  (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div>I asked breathlessly.
<div class="bookquote">``Bella?''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``Hey, Jess, I was just going to call you.''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``You made it home?''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>Her (<font color='blue'><b>I</b></font>) voice was relieved and surprised.
<div class="bookquote">``Yes. I left my jacket in your car  could you bring it to me tomorrow?''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``Sure. But tell me what happened!''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>I</b></font>) demanded.
<div class="bookquote">``Um, tomorrow  in Trig, okay?''
 (<font color='red'><b>She</b></font>)</div>She (<font color='blue'><b>I</b></font>) caught on quickly. <div class="bookquote">``Oh, is your dad there?''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``Yes, that's right.''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``Okay, I'll talk to you tomorrow, then. Bye!''  (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div>I could hear the impatience in her (<font color='blue'><b>I</b></font>) voice.
<div class="bookquote">``Bye, Jess.''
 (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div>I walked up the stairs slowly, a heavy stupor clouding my mind. I went through the motions of getting
ready for bed without paying any attention to what I was doing. It wasn't until I was in the shower  the
water too hot, burning my skin  that I realized I was freezing. I shuddered violently for several minutes
before the steaming spray could finally relax my rigid muscles. Then I stood in the shower, too tired to
move, until the hot water began to run out.
I stumbled out, wrapping myself securely in a towel, trying to hold the heat from the water in so the
aching shivers wouldn't return. I dressed for bed swiftly and climbed under my quilt, curling into a ball,
hugging myself to keep warm. A few small shudders trembled through me.
My mind still swirled dizzily, full of images I couldn't understand, and some I fought to repress. Nothing
seemed clear at first, but as I fell gradually closer to unconsciousness, a few certainties became evident.
About three things I was absolutely positive. First, Edward was a vampire. Second, there was part of
him (<font color='blue'><b>Edward</b></font>)  and I didn't know how potent that part might be  that thirsted for my blood. And third, I was
unconditionally and irrevocably in love with him (<font color='blue'><b>Edward</b></font>).

<p/>10. INTERROGATIONS

<p/>It was very hard, in the morning, to argue with the part of me that was sure last night was a dream. Logic
wasn't on my side, or common sense. I clung to the parts I couldn't have imagined  like his (<font color='blue'><b>Edward</b></font>) smell. I was
sure I could never have dreamed that up on my own.
It was foggy and dark outside my window, absolutely perfect. He (<font color='blue'><b>Edward</b></font>) had no reason not to be in school
today. I dressed in my heavy clothes, remembering I didn't have a jacket. Further proof that my memory
was real.
When I got downstairs, Charlie was gone again  I was running later than I'd realized. I swallowed a
granola bar in three bites, chased it down with milk straight from the carton, and then hurried out the
door. Hopefully the rain would hold off until I could find Jessica.
It was unusually foggy; the air was almost smoky with it. The mist was ice cold where it clung to the
exposed skin on my face and neck. I couldn't wait to get the heat going in my truck. It was such a thick
fog that I was a few feet down the driveway before I realized there was a car in it: a silver car. My heart
thudded, stuttered, and then picked up again in double time.
I didn't see where he (<font color='blue'><b>It</b></font>) came from, but suddenly he (<font color='blue'><b>It</b></font>) was there, pulling the door open for me.
<div class="bookquote">``Do you want to ride with me today?''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>It</b></font>) asked, amused by my expression as he (<font color='blue'><b>It</b></font>) caught me by surprise
yet again. There was uncertainty in his (<font color='blue'><b>It</b></font>) voice. He (<font color='blue'><b>It</b></font>) was really giving me a choice  I was free to refuse,
and part of him (<font color='blue'><b>It</b></font>) hoped for that. It was a vain hope.
<div class="bookquote">``Yes, thank you,''  (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div>I said, trying to keep my voice calm. As I stepped into the warm car, I noticed his (<font color='blue'><b>It</b></font>) tan
jacket was slung over the headrest of the passenger seat. The door closed behind me, and, sooner than
should be possible, he (<font color='blue'><b>It</b></font>) was sitting next to me, starting the car.
<div class="bookquote">``I brought the jacket for you. I didn't want you to get sick or something.''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>His (<font color='blue'><b>It</b></font>) voice was guarded. I
noticed that he (<font color='blue'><b>It</b></font>) wore no jacket himself, just a light gray knit V-neck shirt with long sleeves. Again, the
fabric clung to his (<font color='blue'><b>It</b></font>) perfectly muscled chest. It was a colossal tribute to his (<font color='blue'><b>It</b></font>) face that it kept my eyes away
from his (<font color='blue'><b>It</b></font>) body.
<div class="bookquote">``I'm not quite that delicate,''  (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div>I said, but I pulled the jacket onto my lap, pushing my arms through the
too-long sleeves, curious to see if the scent could possibly be as good as I remembered. It was better.
<div class="bookquote">``Aren't you?''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>It</b></font>) contradicted in a voice so low I wasn't sure if he (<font color='blue'><b>It</b></font>) meant for me to hear.
We drove through the fog-shrouded streets, always too fast, feeling awkward. I was, at least. Last night
all the walls were down almost all. I didn't know if we were still being as candid today. It left me
tongue-tied. I waited for him (<font color='blue'><b>It</b></font>) to speak.
He (<font color='blue'><b>It</b></font>) turned to smirk at me. <div class="bookquote">``What, no twenty questions today?''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``Do my questions bother you?''  (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div>I asked, relieved.
<div class="bookquote">``Not as much as your reactions do.''  (<font color='red'><b>He</b></font>)</div>He (<font color='blue'><b>It</b></font>) looked like he (<font color='blue'><b>It</b></font>) was joking, but I couldn't be sure.
I frowned. <div class="bookquote">``Do I react badly?''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``No, that's the problem. You take everything so coolly  it's unnatural. It makes me wonder what you're
really thinking.''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``I always tell you what I'm really thinking.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``You edit,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>It</b></font>) accused.
<div class="bookquote">``Not very much.''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``Enough to drive me insane.''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``You don't want to hear it,''  (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div>I mumbled, almost whispered. As soon as the words were out, I regretted
them. The pain in my voice was very faint; I could only hope he (<font color='blue'><b>It</b></font>) hadn't noticed it.
He (<font color='blue'><b>It</b></font>) didn't respond, and I wondered if I had ruined the mood. His (<font color='blue'><b>It</b></font>) face was unreadable as we drove into
the school parking lot. Something occurred to me belatedly.
<div class="bookquote">``Where's the rest of your family?''  (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div>I asked  more than glad to be alone with him (<font color='blue'><b>It</b></font>), but remembering that
his (<font color='blue'><b>It</b></font>) car was usually full.
<div class="bookquote">``They took Rosalie's car.''  (<font color='red'><b>He</b></font>)</div>He (<font color='blue'><b>It</b></font>) shrugged as he (<font color='blue'><b>It</b></font>) parked next to a glossy red convertible with the top up.
<div class="bookquote">``Ostentatious, isn't it?''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``Um, wow,''  (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div>I breathed. <div class="bookquote">``If she (<font color='blue'><b>Rosalie</b></font>) has that, why does she (<font color='blue'><b>Rosalie</b></font>) ride with you?''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``Like I said, it's ostentatious. We try to blend in.''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``You don't succeed.''  (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div>I laughed and shook my head as we got out of the car. I wasn't late anymore; his (<font color='blue'><b>It</b></font>)
lunatic driving had gotten me to school in plenty of time. <div class="bookquote">``So why did Rosalie drive today if it's more
conspicuous?''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``Hadn't you noticed? I'm breaking all the rules now.''  (<font color='red'><b>He</b></font>)</div>He (<font color='blue'><b>It</b></font>) met me at the front of the car, staying very
close to my side as we walked onto campus. I wanted to close that little distance, to reach out and touch
him (<font color='blue'><b>It</b></font>), but I was afraid he (<font color='blue'><b>It</b></font>) wouldn't like me to.
<div class="bookquote">``Why do you have cars like that at all?''  (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div>I wondered aloud. <div class="bookquote">``If you're looking for privacy?''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``An indulgence,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>It</b></font>) admitted with an impish smile. <div class="bookquote">``We all like to drive fast.''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``Figures,''  (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div>I muttered under my breath.
Under the shelter of the cafeteria roof's overhang, Jessica was waiting, her (<font color='blue'><b>Jessica</b></font>) eyes about to bug out of their
sockets. Over her (<font color='blue'><b>Jessica</b></font>) arm, bless her (<font color='blue'><b>Jessica</b></font>), was my jacket.
<div class="bookquote">``Hey, Jessica,''  (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div>I said when we were a few feet away. <div class="bookquote">``Thanks for remembering.''  (<font color='red'><b>She</b></font>)</div>She (<font color='blue'><b>Jessica</b></font>) handed me my
jacket without speaking.
<div class="bookquote">``Good morning, Jessica,''  (<font color='red'><b>Edward/Edward Cullen/Cullen</b></font>)</div>Edward said politely. It wasn't really his (<font color='blue'><b>Edward</b></font>) fault that his (<font color='blue'><b>Edward</b></font>) voice was so irresistible.
Or what his (<font color='blue'><b>Edward</b></font>) eyes were capable of.
<div class="bookquote">``Er hi.''  (<font color='red'><b>She</b></font>)</div>She (<font color='blue'><b>Jessica</b></font>) shifted her (<font color='blue'><b>Jessica</b></font>) wide eyes to me, trying to gather her (<font color='blue'><b>Jessica</b></font>) jumbled thoughts. <div class="bookquote">``I guess I'll see you in
Trig.''  (<font color='red'><b>She</b></font>)</div>She (<font color='blue'><b>Jessica</b></font>) gave me a meaningful look, and I suppressed a sigh. What on earth was I going to tell her (<font color='blue'><b>Jessica</b></font>)?
<div class="bookquote">``Yeah, I'll see you then.''
 (<font color='red'><b>She</b></font>)</div>She (<font color='blue'><b>Jessica</b></font>) walked away, pausing twice to peek back over her (<font color='blue'><b>Jessica</b></font>) shoulder at us.
<div class="bookquote">``What are you going to tell her (<font color='blue'><b>Jessica</b></font>)?''  (<font color='red'><b>Edward/Edward Cullen/Cullen</b></font>)</div>Edward murmured.
<div class="bookquote">``Hey, I thought you couldn't read my mind!''  (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div>I hissed.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``I can't,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Edward</b></font>) said, startled. Then understanding brightened his (<font color='blue'><b>Edward</b></font>) eyes. <div class="bookquote">``However, I can read hers  she (<font color='blue'><b>Jessica</b></font>)'ll be
waiting to ambush you in class.''
 (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div>I groaned as I pulled off his (<font color='blue'><b>Edward</b></font>) jacket and handed it to him (<font color='blue'><b>Edward</b></font>), replacing it with my own. He (<font color='blue'><b>Edward</b></font>) folded it over his (<font color='blue'><b>Edward</b></font>)
arm.
<div class="bookquote">``So what are you going to tell her (<font color='blue'><b>Jessica</b></font>)?''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``A little help?''  (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div>I pleaded. <div class="bookquote">``What does she (<font color='blue'><b>Jessica</b></font>) want to know?''
 (<font color='red'><b>He</b></font>)</div>He (<font color='blue'><b>Edward</b></font>) shook his (<font color='blue'><b>Edward</b></font>) head, grinning wickedly. <div class="bookquote">``That's not fair.''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``No, you not sharing what you know  now that's not fair.''
 (<font color='red'><b>He</b></font>)</div>He (<font color='blue'><b>Edward</b></font>) deliberated for a moment as we walked. We stopped outside the door to my first class.
<div class="bookquote">``She (<font color='blue'><b>Jessica</b></font>) wants to know if we're secretly dating. And she (<font color='blue'><b>Jessica</b></font>) wants to know how you feel about me,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Edward</b></font>) finally
said.
<div class="bookquote">``Yikes. What should I say?''  (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div>I tried to keep my expression very innocent. People were passing us on their
way to class, probably staring, but I was barely aware of them.
<div class="bookquote">``Hmmm.''  (<font color='red'><b>He</b></font>)</div>He (<font color='blue'><b>Edward</b></font>) paused to catch a stray lock of hair that was escaping the twist on my neck and wound it
back into place. My heart spluttered hyperactively. <div class="bookquote">``I suppose you could say yes to the first if you
don't mind  it's easier than any other explanation.''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``I don't mind,''  (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div>I said in a faint voice.
<div class="bookquote">``And as for her (<font color='blue'><b>Jessica</b></font>) other question well, I'll be listening to hear the answer to that one myself.''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>One side of
his (<font color='blue'><b>Edward</b></font>) mouth pulled up into my favorite uneven smile. I couldn't catch my breath soon enough to respond to
that remark. He (<font color='blue'><b>Edward</b></font>) turned and walked away.
<div class="bookquote">``I'll see you at lunch,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Edward</b></font>) called over his (<font color='blue'><b>Edward</b></font>) shoulder. Three people walking in the door stopped to stare at
me.
I hurried into class, flushed and irritated. He (<font color='blue'><b>Edward</b></font>) was such a cheater. Now I was even more worried about
what I was going to say to Jessica. I sat in my usual seat, slamming my bag down in aggravation.
<div class="bookquote">``Morning, Bella,''  (<font color='red'><b>Mike/Mike Newton/Newton</b></font>)</div>Mike said from the seat next to me. I looked up to see an odd, almost resigned look on
his (<font color='blue'><b>Mike</b></font>) face. <div class="bookquote">``How was Port Angeles?''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``It was''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>There was no honest way to sum it up. <div class="bookquote">``Great,''  (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div>I finished lamely. <div class="bookquote">``Jessica got a really cute
dress.''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``Did she (<font color='blue'><b>Jessica</b></font>) say anything about Monday night?''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Mike</b></font>) asked, his (<font color='blue'><b>Mike</b></font>) eyes brightening. I smiled at the turn the
conversation had taken.
<div class="bookquote">``She (<font color='blue'><b>Jessica</b></font>) said she (<font color='blue'><b>Jessica</b></font>) had a really good time,''  (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div>I assured him (<font color='blue'><b>Mike</b></font>).
<div class="bookquote">``She (<font color='blue'><b>Jessica</b></font>) did?''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Mike</b></font>) said eagerly.
<div class="bookquote">``Most definitely.''
 (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Mason</b></font>)</div>Mr. Mason called the class to order then, asking us to turn in our papers. English and then Government
passed in a blur, while I worried about how to explain things to Jessica and agonized over whether

<p/>Edward would really be listening to what I said through the medium of Jess's thoughts. How very
inconvenient his (<font color='blue'><b>Edward</b></font>) little talent could be  when it wasn't saving my life.
The fog had almost dissolved by the end of the second hour, but the day was still dark with low,
oppressing clouds. I smiled up at the sky.
Edward was right, of course. When I walked into Trig Jessica was sitting in the back row, nearly
bouncing off her (<font color='blue'><b>Jessica</b></font>) seat in agitation. I reluctantly went to sit by her (<font color='blue'><b>Jessica</b></font>), trying to convince myself it would be
better to get it over with as soon as possible.
<div class="bookquote">``Tell me everything!''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Jessica</b></font>) commanded before I was in the seat.
<div class="bookquote">``What do you want to know?''  (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div>I hedged.
<div class="bookquote">``What happened last night?''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``He (<font color='blue'><b>Great</b></font>) bought me dinner, and then he (<font color='blue'><b>Great</b></font>) drove me home.''
 (<font color='red'><b>She</b></font>)</div>She (<font color='blue'><b>Jessica</b></font>) glared at me, her (<font color='blue'><b>Jessica</b></font>) expression stiff with skepticism. <div class="bookquote">``How did you get home so fast?''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``He (<font color='blue'><b>Great</b></font>) drives like a maniac. It was terrifying.''  (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div>I hoped he (<font color='blue'><b>Edward</b></font>) heard that.
<div class="bookquote">``Was it like a date  did you tell him (<font color='blue'><b>Great</b></font>) to meet you there?''
 (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div>I hadn't thought of that. <div class="bookquote">``No  I was very surprised to see him (<font color='blue'><b>Great</b></font>) there.''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>Her (<font color='blue'><b>Jessica</b></font>) lips puckered in disappointment at the transparent honesty in my voice.
<div class="bookquote">``But he (<font color='blue'><b>Great</b></font>) picked you up for school today?''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Jessica</b></font>) probed.
<div class="bookquote">``Yes  that was a surprise, too. He (<font color='blue'><b>Great</b></font>) noticed I didn't have a jacket last night,''  (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div>I explained.
<div class="bookquote">``So are you going out again?''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``He (<font color='blue'><b>Great</b></font>) offered to drive me to Seattle Saturday because he (<font color='blue'><b>Great</b></font>) thinks toy truck isn't up to it  does that count?''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``Yes.''  (<font color='red'><b>She</b></font>)</div>She (<font color='blue'><b>Jessica</b></font>) nodded.
<div class="bookquote">``Well, then, yes.''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``W-o-w.''  (<font color='red'><b>She</b></font>)</div>She (<font color='blue'><b>Jessica</b></font>) exaggerated the word into three syllables. <div class="bookquote">``Edward Cullen.''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``I know,''  (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div>I agreed. <div class="bookquote">``Wow''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>didn't even cover it.
<div class="bookquote">``Wait!''  (<font color='red'><b>me</b></font>)</div>Her (<font color='blue'><b>Jessica</b></font>) hands flew up, palms toward me like she (<font color='blue'><b>Jessica</b></font>) was stopping traffic. <div class="bookquote">``Has he (<font color='blue'><b>Cullen</b></font>) kissed you?''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``No,''  (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div>I mumbled. <div class="bookquote">``It's not like that.''
 (<font color='red'><b>She</b></font>)</div>She (<font color='blue'><b>Jessica</b></font>) looked disappointed. I'm sure I did, too.
<div class="bookquote">``Do you think Saturday ?''  (<font color='red'><b>She</b></font>)</div>She (<font color='blue'><b>Jessica</b></font>) raised her (<font color='blue'><b>Jessica</b></font>) eyebrows.
<div class="bookquote">``I really doubt it.''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>The discontent in my voice was poorly disguised.
<div class="bookquote">``What did you talk about?''  (<font color='red'><b>She</b></font>)</div>She (<font color='blue'><b>Jessica</b></font>) pushed for more information in a whisper. Class had started but Mr.
Varner wasn't paying close attention and we weren't the only ones still talking.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``I don't know, Jess, lots of stuff,''  (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div>I whispered back. <div class="bookquote">``We talked about the English essay a little.''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>A very,
very little. I think he (<font color='blue'><b>Varner</b></font>) mentioned it in passing.
<div class="bookquote">``Please, Bella,''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Jessica</b></font>) begged. <div class="bookquote">``Give me some details.''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``Well okay, I've got one. You should have seen the waitress flirting with him (<font color='blue'><b>Cullen</b></font>)  it was over the top.
But he (<font color='blue'><b>Cullen</b></font>) didn't pay any attention to her (<font color='blue'><b>waitress</b></font>) at all.''  (<font color='red'><b>him</b></font>)</div>Let him (<font color='blue'><b>Varner</b></font>) make what he (<font color='blue'><b>Varner</b></font>) could of that.
<div class="bookquote">``That's a good sign,''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Jessica</b></font>) nodded. <div class="bookquote">``Was she (<font color='blue'><b>waitress</b></font>) pretty?''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``Very  and probably nineteen or twenty.''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``Even better. He (<font color='blue'><b>Cullen</b></font>) must like you.''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``I think so, but it's hard to tell. He (<font color='blue'><b>Cullen</b></font>)'s always so cryptic,''  (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div>I threw in for his (<font color='blue'><b>Varner</b></font>) benefit, sighing.
<div class="bookquote">``I don't know how you're brave enough to be alone with him (<font color='blue'><b>Cullen</b></font>),''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Jessica</b></font>) breathed.
<div class="bookquote">``Why?''  (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div>I was shocked, but she (<font color='blue'><b>Jessica</b></font>) didn't understand my reaction.
<div class="bookquote">``He (<font color='blue'><b>Cullen</b></font>)'s so intimidating. I wouldn't know what to say to him (<font color='blue'><b>Cullen</b></font>).''  (<font color='red'><b>She</b></font>)</div>She (<font color='blue'><b>Jessica</b></font>) made a face, probably remembering
this morning or last night, when he (<font color='blue'><b>Varner</b></font>)'d turned the overwhelming force of his (<font color='blue'><b>Varner</b></font>) eyes on her (<font color='blue'><b>Jessica</b></font>).
<div class="bookquote">``I do have some trouble with incoherency when I'm around him (<font color='blue'><b>Cullen</b></font>),''  (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div>I admitted.
<div class="bookquote">``Oh well. He (<font color='blue'><b>Cullen</b></font>) is unbelievably gorgeous.''  (<font color='red'><b>Jessica</b></font>)</div>Jessica shrugged as if this excused any flaws. Which, in her (<font color='blue'><b>Jessica</b></font>)
book, it probably did.
<div class="bookquote">``There's a lot more to him (<font color='blue'><b>Cullen</b></font>) than that.''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``Really? Like what?''
 (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div>I wished I had let it go. Almost as much as I was hoping he (<font color='blue'><b>Varner</b></font>)'d been kidding about listening in.
<div class="bookquote">``I can't explain it right but he (<font color='blue'><b>Cullen</b></font>)'s even more unbelievable behind the face.''  (<font color='red'><b>The vampire</b></font>)</div>The vampire who wanted to
be good  who ran around saving people's lives so he (<font color='blue'><b>Varner</b></font>) wouldn't be a monster I stared toward the
front of the room.
<div class="bookquote">``Is that possible?''  (<font color='red'><b>She</b></font>)</div>She (<font color='blue'><b>Jessica</b></font>) giggled.
I ignored her (<font color='blue'><b>Jessica</b></font>), trying to look like I was paying attention to Mr. Varner.
<div class="bookquote">``So you like him (<font color='blue'><b>Cullen</b></font>), then?''  (<font color='red'><b>She</b></font>)</div>She (<font color='blue'><b>Jessica</b></font>) wasn't about to give up.
<div class="bookquote">``Yes,''  (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div>I said curtly.
<div class="bookquote">``I mean, do you really like him (<font color='blue'><b>Cullen</b></font>)?''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Jessica</b></font>) urged.
<div class="bookquote">``Yes,''  (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div>I said again, blushing. I hoped that detail wouldn't register in her (<font color='blue'><b>Jessica</b></font>) thoughts.
She (<font color='blue'><b>Jessica</b></font>)'d had enough with the single syllable answers. <div class="bookquote">``How much do you like him (<font color='blue'><b>Cullen</b></font>)?''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``Too much,''  (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div>I whispered back. <div class="bookquote">``More than he (<font color='blue'><b>Cullen</b></font>) likes me. But I don't see how I can help that.''  (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div>I sighed,
one blush blending into the next.
Then, thankfully, Mr. Varner called on Jessica for an answer.

<p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>Jessica</b></font>) didn't get a chance to start on the subject again during class, and as soon as the bell rang, I took
evasive action.
<div class="bookquote">``In English, Mike asked me if you said anything about Monday night,''  (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div>I told her (<font color='blue'><b>Jessica</b></font>).
<div class="bookquote">``You're kidding! What did you say?!''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Jessica</b></font>) gasped, completely sidetracked.
<div class="bookquote">``I told him (<font color='blue'><b>Mike</b></font>) you said you had a lot of fun  he (<font color='blue'><b>Mike</b></font>) looked pleased.''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``Tell me exactly what he (<font color='blue'><b>Mike</b></font>) said, and your exact answer!''
 (<font color='red'><b>Mike/Mike Newton/Newton</b></font>)</div>We spent the rest of the walk dissecting sentence structures and most of Spanish on a minute description
of Mike's facial expressions. I wouldn't have helped draw it out for as long as I did if I wasn't worried
about the subject returning to me.
And then the bell rang for lunch. As I jumped up out of my seat, shoving my books roughly in my bag,
my uplifted expression must have tipped Jessica off.
<div class="bookquote">``You're not sitting with us today, are you?''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Jessica</b></font>) guessed.
<div class="bookquote">``I don't think so.''  (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div>I couldn't be sure that he (<font color='blue'><b>Mike</b></font>) wouldn't disappear inconveniently again.
But outside the door to our Spanish class, leaning against the wall  looking more like a Greek god than
anyone had a right to  Edward was waiting for me. Jessica took one look, rolled her (<font color='blue'><b>Jessica</b></font>) eyes, and
departed.
<div class="bookquote">``See you later, Bella.''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>Her (<font color='blue'><b>Jessica</b></font>) voice was thick with implications. I might have to turn off the ringer on the
phone.
<div class="bookquote">``Hello.''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>His (<font color='blue'><b>Edward</b></font>) voice was amused and irritated at the same time. He (<font color='blue'><b>Edward</b></font>) had been listening, it was obvious.
<div class="bookquote">``Hi.''
 (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div>I couldn't think of anything else to say, and he (<font color='blue'><b>Edward</b></font>) didn't speak  biding his (<font color='blue'><b>Edward</b></font>) time, I presumed  so it was a
quiet walk to the cafeteria. Walking with Edward through the crowded lunchtime rush was a lot like my
first day here; everyone stared.
He (<font color='blue'><b>Edward</b></font>) led the way into the line, still not speaking, though his (<font color='blue'><b>Edward</b></font>) eyes returned to my face every few seconds,
their expression speculative. It seemed to me that irritation was winning out over amusement as the
dominant emotion in his (<font color='blue'><b>Edward</b></font>) face. I fidgeted nervously with the zipper on my jacket.
He (<font color='blue'><b>Edward</b></font>) stepped up to the counter and filled a tray with food.
<div class="bookquote">``What are you doing?''  (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div>I objected. <div class="bookquote">``You're not getting all that for me?''
 (<font color='red'><b>He</b></font>)</div>He (<font color='blue'><b>Edward</b></font>) shook his (<font color='blue'><b>Edward</b></font>) head, stepping forward to buy the food.
<div class="bookquote">``Half is for me, of course.''
 (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div>I raised one eyebrow.
He (<font color='blue'><b>Edward</b></font>) led the way to the same place we'd sat that one time before. From the other end of the long table, a
group of seniors gazed at us in amazement as we sat across from each other. Edward seemed oblivious.
<div class="bookquote">``Take whatever you want,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Edward</b></font>) said, pushing the tray toward me.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``I'm curious,''  (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div>I said as I picked up an apple, turning it around in my hands, <div class="bookquote">``what would you do if
someone dared you to eat food?''
 (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``You're always curious.''  (<font color='red'><b>He</b></font>)</div>He (<font color='blue'><b>Edward</b></font>) grimaced, shaking his (<font color='blue'><b>Edward</b></font>) head. He (<font color='blue'><b>Edward</b></font>) glared at me, holding my eyes as he (<font color='blue'><b>Edward</b></font>) lifted
the slice of pizza off the tray, and deliberately bit off a mouthful, chewed quickly, and then swallowed. I
watched, eyes wide.
<div class="bookquote">``If someone dared you to eat dirt, you could, couldn't you?''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Edward</b></font>) asked condescendingly.
I wrinkled my nose. <div class="bookquote">``I did once on a dare,''  (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div>I admitted. <div class="bookquote">``It wasn't so bad.''
 (<font color='red'><b>He</b></font>)</div>He (<font color='blue'><b>Edward</b></font>) laughed. <div class="bookquote">``I suppose I'm not surprised.''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>Something over my shoulder seemed to catch his (<font color='blue'><b>Edward</b></font>) attention.
<div class="bookquote">``Jessica's analyzing everything I do  she (<font color='blue'><b>Jessica</b></font>)'ll break it down for you later.''  (<font color='red'><b>He</b></font>)</div>He (<font color='blue'><b>Edward</b></font>) pushed the rest of the pizza
toward me. The mention of Jessica brought a hint of his (<font color='blue'><b>Edward</b></font>) former irritation back to his (<font color='blue'><b>Edward</b></font>) features.
I put down the apple and took a bite of the pizza, looking away, knowing he (<font color='blue'><b>Edward</b></font>) was about to start.
<div class="bookquote">``So the waitress was pretty, was she (<font color='blue'><b>waitress</b></font>)?''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Edward</b></font>) asked casually.
<div class="bookquote">``You really didn't notice?''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``No. I wasn't paying attention. I had a lot on my mind.''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``Poor girl.''  (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div>I could afford to be generous now.
<div class="bookquote">``Something you said to Jessica well, it bothers me.''  (<font color='red'><b>He</b></font>)</div>He (<font color='blue'><b>Edward</b></font>) refused to be distracted. His (<font color='blue'><b>Edward</b></font>) voice was husky,
and he (<font color='blue'><b>Edward</b></font>) glanced up from under his (<font color='blue'><b>Edward</b></font>) lashes with troubled eyes.
<div class="bookquote">``I'm not surprised you heard something you didn't like. You know what they say about eavesdropners,''  (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div>I
reminded him (<font color='blue'><b>Edward</b></font>).
<div class="bookquote">``I warned you I would be listening.''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``And I warned you that you didn't want to know everything I was thinking.''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``You did,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Edward</b></font>) agreed, but his (<font color='blue'><b>Edward</b></font>) voice was still rough. <div class="bookquote">``You aren't precisely right, though. I do want to know
what you're thinking  everything. I just wish that you wouldn't be thinking some things.''
 (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div>I scowled. <div class="bookquote">``That's quite a distinction.''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``But that's not really the point at the moment.''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``Then what is?''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>We were inclined toward each other across the table now. He (<font color='blue'><b>Edward</b></font>) had his (<font color='blue'><b>Edward</b></font>) large white hands
folded under his (<font color='blue'><b>Edward</b></font>) chin; I leaned forward, my right hand cupped around my neck. I had to remind myself
that we were in a crowded lunchroom, with probably many curious eyes on us. It was too easy to get
wrapped up in our own private, tense little bubble.
<div class="bookquote">``Do you truly believe that you care more for me than I do for you?''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Edward</b></font>) murmured, leaning closer to me as
he (<font color='blue'><b>Edward</b></font>) spoke, his (<font color='blue'><b>Edward</b></font>) dark golden eyes piercing.
I tried to remember how to exhale. I had to look away before it came back to me.
<div class="bookquote">``You're doing it again,''  (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div>I muttered.
His (<font color='blue'><b>Edward</b></font>) eyes opened wide with surprise. <div class="bookquote">``What?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Dazzling me,''  (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div>I admitted, trying to concentrate as I looked back at him (<font color='blue'><b>Edward</b></font>).
<div class="bookquote">``Oh.''  (<font color='red'><b>He</b></font>)</div>He (<font color='blue'><b>Edward</b></font>) frowned.
<div class="bookquote">``It's not your fault,''  (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div>I sighed. <div class="bookquote">``You can't help it.''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``Are you going to answer the question?''
 (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div>I looked down. <div class="bookquote">``Yes.''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``Yes, you are going to answer, or yes, you really think that?''  (<font color='red'><b>He</b></font>)</div>He (<font color='blue'><b>Edward</b></font>) was irritated again.
<div class="bookquote">``Yes, I really think that.''  (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div>I kept my eyes down on the table, my eyes tracing the pattern of the faux wood
grains printed on the laminate. The silence dragged on. I stubbornly refused to be the first to break it this
time, fighting hard against the temptation to peek at his (<font color='blue'><b>Edward</b></font>) expression.
Finally he (<font color='blue'><b>Edward</b></font>) spoke, voice velvet soft. <div class="bookquote">``You're wrong.''
 (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div>I glanced up to see that his (<font color='blue'><b>Edward</b></font>) eyes were gentle.
<div class="bookquote">``You can't know that,''  (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div>I disagreed in a whisper. I shook my head in doubt, though my heart throbbed at
his (<font color='blue'><b>Edward</b></font>) words and I wanted so badly to believe them.
<div class="bookquote">``What makes you think so?''  (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div>His (<font color='blue'><b>Edward</b></font>) liquid topaz eyes were penetrating  trying futilely, I assumed, to lift the
truth straight from my mind.
I stared back, struggling to think clearly in spite of his (<font color='blue'><b>Edward</b></font>) face, to find some way to explain. As I searched
for the words, I could see him (<font color='blue'><b>Edward</b></font>) getting impatient; frustrated by my silence, he (<font color='blue'><b>Edward</b></font>) started to scowl. I lifted my
hand from my neck, and held up one finger.
<div class="bookquote">``Let me think,''  (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div>I insisted. His (<font color='blue'><b>Edward</b></font>) expression cleared, now that he (<font color='blue'><b>Edward</b></font>) was satisfied that I was planning to answer.
I dropped my hand to the table, moving my left hand so that my palms were pressed together. I stared at
my hands, twisting and untwisting my fingers, as I finally spoke.
<div class="bookquote">``Well, aside from the obvious, sometimes''  (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div>I hesitated. <div class="bookquote">``I can't be sure  I don't know how to read
minds  but sometimes it seems like you're trying to say goodbye when you're saying something else.''
 (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div>That was the best I could sum up the sensation of anguish that his (<font color='blue'><b>Edward</b></font>) words triggered in me at times.
<div class="bookquote">``Perceptive,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Edward</b></font>) whispered. And there was the anguish again, surfacing as he (<font color='blue'><b>Edward</b></font>) confirmed my fear. <div class="bookquote">``That's
exactly why you're wrong, though,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Edward</b></font>) began to explain, but then his (<font color='blue'><b>Edward</b></font>) eyes narrowed. <div class="bookquote">``What do you
mean, `the obvious'?''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``Well, look at me,''  (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div>I said, unnecessarily as he (<font color='blue'><b>Edward</b></font>) was already staring. <div class="bookquote">``I'm absolutely ordinary  well,
except for bad things like all the near-death experiences and being so clumsy that I'm almost disabled.
And look at you.''  (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div>I waved my hand toward him (<font color='blue'><b>Edward</b></font>) and all his (<font color='blue'><b>Edward</b></font>) bewildering perfection.
His (<font color='blue'><b>Edward</b></font>) brow creased angrily for a moment, then smoothed as his (<font color='blue'><b>Edward</b></font>) eyes took on a knowing look. <div class="bookquote">``You don't
see yourself very clearly, you know. I'll admit you're dead-on about the bad things,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Edward</b></font>) chuckled blackly,
<div class="bookquote">``but you didn't hear what every human male in this school was thinking on your first day.''
 (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>I blinked, astonished. <div class="bookquote">``I don't believe it''  (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div>I mumbled to myself.
<div class="bookquote">``Trust me just this once  you are the opposite of ordinary.''
 (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>My embarrassment was much stronger than my pleasure at the look that came into his (<font color='blue'><b>Edward</b></font>) eyes when he (<font color='blue'><b>Edward</b></font>) said

<p/>this. I quickly reminded him (<font color='blue'><b>Edward</b></font>) of my original argument.
<div class="bookquote">``But I'm not saying goodbye,''  (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div>I pointed out.
<div class="bookquote">``Don't you see? That's what proves me right. I care the most, because if I can do it''   (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Edward</b></font>) shook his (<font color='blue'><b>Edward</b></font>)
head, seeming to struggle with the thought  <div class="bookquote">``if leaving is the right thing to do, then I'll hurt myself to
keep from hurting you, to keep you safe.''
 (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>I glared. <div class="bookquote">``And you don't think I would do the same?''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``You'd never have to make the choice.''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>Abruptly, his (<font color='blue'><b>Edward</b></font>) unpredictable mood shifted again; a mischievous, devastating smile rearranged his (<font color='blue'><b>Edward</b></font>) features.
<div class="bookquote">``Of course, keeping you safe is beginning to feel like a full-time occupation that requires my constant
presence.''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``No one has tried to do away with me today,''  (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div>I reminded him (<font color='blue'><b>Edward</b></font>), grateful for the lighter subject. I didn't
want him (<font color='blue'><b>Edward</b></font>) to talk about goodbyes anymore. If I had to, I supposed I could purposefully put myself in
danger to keep him (<font color='blue'><b>Edward</b></font>) close I banished that thought before his (<font color='blue'><b>Edward</b></font>) quick eyes read it on my face. That idea
would definitely get me in trouble.
<div class="bookquote">``Yet,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Edward</b></font>) added.
<div class="bookquote">``Yet,''  (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div>I agreed; I would have argued, but now I wanted him (<font color='blue'><b>Edward</b></font>) to be expecting disasters.
<div class="bookquote">``I have another question for you.''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>His (<font color='blue'><b>Edward</b></font>) face was still casual.
<div class="bookquote">``Shoot.''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``Do you really need to go to Seattle this Saturday, or was that just an excuse to get out of saying no to
all your admirers?''
 (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div>I made a face at the memory. <div class="bookquote">``You know, I haven't forgiven you for the Tyler thing yet,''  (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div>I warned him (<font color='blue'><b>Edward</b></font>).
<div class="bookquote">``It's your fault that he (<font color='blue'><b>Tyler</b></font>)'s deluded himself into thinking I'm going to prom with him (<font color='blue'><b>Tyler</b></font>).''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``Oh, he (<font color='blue'><b>Tyler</b></font>) would have found a chance to ask you without me  I just really wanted to watch your face,''
 (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Edward</b></font>) chuckled, I would have been angrier if his (<font color='blue'><b>Edward</b></font>) laughter wasn't so fascinating. <div class="bookquote">``If I'd asked you, would you
have turned me down?''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Edward</b></font>) asked, still laughing to himself.
<div class="bookquote">``Probably not,''  (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div>I admitted. <div class="bookquote">``But I would have canceled later  faked an illness or a sprained ankle.''
 (<font color='red'><b>He</b></font>)</div>He (<font color='blue'><b>Edward</b></font>) was puzzled. <div class="bookquote">``Why would you do that?''
 (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div>I shook my head sadly. <div class="bookquote">``You've never seen me in Gym, I guess, but I would have thought you would
understand.''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``Are you referring to the fact that you can't walk across a flat, stable surface without finding something to
trip over?''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``Obviously.''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``That wouldn't be a problem.''  (<font color='red'><b>He</b></font>)</div>He (<font color='blue'><b>Edward</b></font>) was very confident. <div class="bookquote">``It's all in the leading.''  (<font color='red'><b>He</b></font>)</div>He (<font color='blue'><b>Edward</b></font>) could see that I was
about to protest, and he (<font color='blue'><b>Edward</b></font>) cut me off. <div class="bookquote">``But you never told me  are you resolved on going to Seattle, or
do you mind if we do something different?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/>As long as the <div class="bookquote">``we''  (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div>part was in, I didn't care about anything else.
<div class="bookquote">``I'm open to alternatives,''  (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div>I allowed. <div class="bookquote">``But I do have a favor to ask.''
 (<font color='red'><b>He</b></font>)</div>He (<font color='blue'><b>Edward</b></font>) looked wary, as he (<font color='blue'><b>Edward</b></font>) always did when I asked an open-ended question. <div class="bookquote">``What?''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``Can I drive?''
 (<font color='red'><b>He</b></font>)</div>He (<font color='blue'><b>Edward</b></font>) frowned. <div class="bookquote">``Why?''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``Well, mostly because when I told Charlie I was going to Seattle, he (<font color='blue'><b>Charlie</b></font>) specifically asked if I was going
alone and, at the time, I was. If he (<font color='blue'><b>Charlie</b></font>) asked again, I probably wouldn't lie, but I don't think he (<font color='blue'><b>Charlie</b></font>) will ask
again, and leaving my truck at home would just bring up the subject unnecessarily. And also, because
your driving frightens me.''
 (<font color='red'><b>He</b></font>)</div>He (<font color='blue'><b>Edward</b></font>) rolled his (<font color='blue'><b>Edward</b></font>) eyes. <div class="bookquote">``Of all the things about me that could frighten you, you worry about my driving.''  (<font color='red'><b>He</b></font>)</div>He (<font color='blue'><b>Edward</b></font>)
shook his (<font color='blue'><b>Edward</b></font>) head in disgust, but then his (<font color='blue'><b>Edward</b></font>) eyes were serious again. <div class="bookquote">``Won't you want to tell your father that
you're spending the day with me?''  (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div>There was an undercurrent to his (<font color='blue'><b>Edward</b></font>) question that I didn't understand.
<div class="bookquote">``With Charlie, less is always more.''  (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div>I was definite about that. <div class="bookquote">``Where are we going, anyway?''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``The weather will be nice, so I'll be staying out of the public eye and you can stay with me, if you'd like
to.''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>Again, he (<font color='blue'><b>Edward</b></font>) was leaving the choice up to me.
<div class="bookquote">``And you'll show me what you meant, about the sun?''  (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div>I asked, excited by the idea of unraveling another
of the unknowns.
<div class="bookquote">``Yes.''  (<font color='red'><b>He</b></font>)</div>He (<font color='blue'><b>Edward</b></font>) smiled, and then paused. <div class="bookquote">``But if you don't want to be alone with me, I'd still rather you
didn't go to Seattle by yourself. I shudder to think of the trouble you could find in a city that size.''
 (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div>I was miffed. <div class="bookquote">``Phoenix is three times bigger than Seattle  just in population. In physical size ''
 (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``But apparently,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Edward</b></font>) interrupted me, <div class="bookquote">``your number wasn't up in Phoenix. So I'd rather you stayed near
me.''  (<font color='red'><b>me</b></font>)</div>His (<font color='blue'><b>Edward</b></font>) eyes did that unfair smoldering thing again.
I couldn't argue, with the eyes or the motivation, and it was a moot point anyway. <div class="bookquote">``As it happens, I don't
mind being alone with you.''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``I know,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Edward</b></font>) sighed, brooding. <div class="bookquote">``You should tell Charlie, though.''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``Why in the world would I do that?''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>His (<font color='blue'><b>Edward</b></font>) eyes were suddenly fierce. <div class="bookquote">``To give me some small incentive to bring you back.''
 (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div>I gulped. But, after a moment of thought, I was sure. <div class="bookquote">``I think I'll take my chances.''
 (<font color='red'><b>He</b></font>)</div>He (<font color='blue'><b>Edward</b></font>) exhaled angrily, and looked away.
<div class="bookquote">``Let's talk about something else,''  (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div>I suggested.
<div class="bookquote">``What do you want to talk about?''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Edward</b></font>) asked. He (<font color='blue'><b>Edward</b></font>) was still annoyed.
I glanced around us, making sure we were well out of anyone's hearing. As I cast my eyes around the
room, I caught the eyes of his (<font color='blue'><b>Edward</b></font>) sister, Alice, staring at me. The others were looking at Edward. I looked
away swiftly, back to him (<font color='blue'><b>Edward</b></font>), and I. asked the first thing that came to mind.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Why did you go to that Goat Rocks place last weekend to hunt? Charlie said it wasn't a good place
to hike, because of bears.''
 (<font color='red'><b>He</b></font>)</div>He (<font color='blue'><b>Edward</b></font>) stared at me as if I was missing something very obvious.
<div class="bookquote">``Bears?''  (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div>I gasped, and he (<font color='blue'><b>Edward</b></font>) smirked. <div class="bookquote">``You know, bears are not in season,''  (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div>I added sternly, to hide my
shock.
<div class="bookquote">``If you read carefully, the laws only cover hunting with weapons,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Edward</b></font>) informed me.
He (<font color='blue'><b>Edward</b></font>) watched my face with enjoyment as that slowly sank in.
<div class="bookquote">``Bears?''  (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div>I repeated with difficulty.
<div class="bookquote">``Grizzly is Emmett's favorite.''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>His (<font color='blue'><b>Edward</b></font>) voice was still offhand, but his (<font color='blue'><b>Edward</b></font>) eyes were scrutinizing my reaction. I
tried to pull myself together.
<div class="bookquote">``Hmmm,''  (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div>I said, taking another bite of pizza as an excuse to look down. I chewed slowly, and then took
a long drink of Coke without looking up.
<div class="bookquote">``So,''  (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div>I said after a moment, finally meeting his (<font color='blue'><b>Edward</b></font>) now-anxious gaze. <div class="bookquote">``What's your favorite?''
 (<font color='red'><b>He</b></font>)</div>He (<font color='blue'><b>Edward</b></font>) raised an eyebrow and the corners of his (<font color='blue'><b>Edward</b></font>) mouth turned down in disapproval. <div class="bookquote">``Mountain lion.''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``Ah,''  (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div>I said in a politely disinterested tone, looking for my soda again.
<div class="bookquote">``Of course,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Edward</b></font>) said, and his (<font color='blue'><b>Edward</b></font>) tone mirrored mine, <div class="bookquote">``we have to be careful not to impact the environment
with injudicious hunting. We try to focus on areas with an overpopulation of predators  ranging as far
away as we need. There's always plenty of deer and elk here, and they'll do, but where's the fun in that?''
 (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>He (<font color='blue'><b>Edward</b></font>) smiled teasingly.
<div class="bookquote">``Where indeed,''  (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div>I murmured around another bite of pizza.
<div class="bookquote">``Early spring is Emmett's favorite bear season  they're just coming out of hibernation, so they're more
irritable.''  (<font color='red'><b>He</b></font>)</div>He (<font color='blue'><b>Edward</b></font>) smiled at some remembered joke.
<div class="bookquote">``Nothing more fun than an irritated grizzly bear,''  (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div>I agreed, nodding.
He (<font color='blue'><b>Edward</b></font>) snickered, shaking his (<font color='blue'><b>Edward</b></font>) head. <div class="bookquote">``Tell me what you're really thinking, please.''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``I'm trying to picture it  but I can't,''  (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div>I admitted. <div class="bookquote">``How do you hunt a bear without weapons?''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``Oh, we have weapons.''  (<font color='red'><b>He</b></font>)</div>He (<font color='blue'><b>Edward</b></font>) flashed his (<font color='blue'><b>Edward</b></font>) bright teeth in a brief, threatening smile. I fought back a shiver
before it could expose me. <div class="bookquote">``Just not the kind they consider when writing hunting laws. If you've ever seen
a bear attack on television, you should be able to visualize Emmett hunting.''
 (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div>I couldn't stop the next shiver that flashed down my spine. I peeked across the cafeteria toward Emmett,
grateful that he (<font color='blue'><b>Emmett</b></font>) wasn't looking my way. The thick bands of muscle that wrapped his (<font color='blue'><b>Emmett</b></font>) arms and torso were
somehow even more menacing now.
Edward followed my gaze and chuckled. I stared at him (<font color='blue'><b>Edward</b></font>), unnerved.
<div class="bookquote">``Are you like a bear, too?''  (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div>I asked in a low voice.
<div class="bookquote">``More like the lion, or so they tell me,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Edward</b></font>) said lightly. <div class="bookquote">``Perhaps our preferences are indicative.''

 (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div><p/>I tried to smile. <div class="bookquote">``Perhaps,''  (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div>I repeated. But my mind was filled with opposing images that I couldn't merge
together. <div class="bookquote">``Is that something I might get to see?''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``Absolutely not!''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>His (<font color='blue'><b>Edward</b></font>) face turned even whiter than usual, and his (<font color='blue'><b>Edward</b></font>) eyes were suddenly furious. I leaned
back, stunned and  though I'd never admit it to him (<font color='blue'><b>Edward</b></font>)  frightened by his (<font color='blue'><b>Edward</b></font>) reaction. He (<font color='blue'><b>Edward</b></font>) leaned back as
well, folding his (<font color='blue'><b>Edward</b></font>) arms across his (<font color='blue'><b>Edward</b></font>) chest.
<div class="bookquote">``Too scary for me?''  (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div>I asked when I could control my voice again.
<div class="bookquote">``If that were it, I would take you out tonight,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Edward</b></font>) said, his (<font color='blue'><b>Edward</b></font>) voice cutting. <div class="bookquote">``You need a healthy dose of fear.
Nothing could be more beneficial for you.''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``Then why?''  (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div>I pressed, trying to ignore his (<font color='blue'><b>Edward</b></font>) angry expression.
He (<font color='blue'><b>Edward</b></font>) glared at me for a long minute.
<div class="bookquote">``Later,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Edward</b></font>) finally said. He (<font color='blue'><b>Edward</b></font>) was on his (<font color='blue'><b>Edward</b></font>) feet in one lithe movement. <div class="bookquote">``We're going to be late.''
 (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div>I glanced around, startled to see that he (<font color='blue'><b>Edward</b></font>) was right and the cafeteria was nearly vacant. When I was with
him (<font color='blue'><b>Edward</b></font>), the time and the place were such a muddled blur that I completely lost track of both. I jumped up,
grabbing my bag from the back of my chair.
<div class="bookquote">``Later, then,''  (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div>I agreed. I wouldn't forget.

<p/>11. COMPLICATIONS

<p/>Everyone watched us as we walked together to our lab table. I noticed that he (<font color='blue'><b>Edward</b></font>) no longer angled the chair
to sit as far from me as the desk would allow. Instead, he (<font color='blue'><b>Edward</b></font>) sat quite close beside me, our arms almost
touching.
Mr. Banner backed into the room then  what superb timing the man had  pulling a tall metal frame
on wheels that held a heavy-looking, outdated TV and VCR. A movie day  the lift in the class
atmosphere was almost tangible.
Mr. Banner shoved the tape into the reluctant VCR and walked to the wall to turn off the lights.
And then, as the room went black, I was suddenly hyperaware that Edward was sitting less than an inch
from me. I was stunned by the unexpected electricity that flowed through me, amazed that it was possible
to be more aware of him (<font color='blue'><b>Edward</b></font>) than I already was. A crazy impulse to reach over and touch him (<font color='blue'><b>Edward</b></font>), to stroke his (<font color='blue'><b>Edward</b></font>)
perfect face just once in the darkness, nearly overwhelmed me. I crossed my arms tightly across my
chest, my hands balling into fists. I was losing my mind.
The opening credits began, lighting the room by a token amount. My eyes, of their own accord, flickered
to him (<font color='blue'><b>Edward</b></font>). I smiled sheepishly as I realized his (<font color='blue'><b>Edward</b></font>) posture was identical to mine, fists clenched under his (<font color='blue'><b>Edward</b></font>) arms,
right down to the eyes, peering sideways at me. He (<font color='blue'><b>Edward</b></font>) grinned back, his (<font color='blue'><b>Edward</b></font>) eyes somehow managing to
smolder, even in the dark. I looked away before I could start hyperventilating. It was absolutely
ridiculous that I should feel dizzy.
The hour seemed very long. I couldn't concentrate on the movie  I didn't even know what subject it
was on. I tried unsuccessfully to relax, but the electric current that seemed to be originating from
somewhere in his (<font color='blue'><b>Edward</b></font>) body never slackened. Occasionally I would permit myself a quick glance in his (<font color='blue'><b>Edward</b></font>)

<p/>direction, but he (<font color='blue'><b>Edward</b></font>) never seemed to relax, either. The overpowering craving to touch him (<font color='blue'><b>Edward</b></font>) also refused to
fade, and I crushed my fists safely against my ribs until my fingers were aching with the effort.
I breathed a sigh of relief when Mr. Banner flicked the lights back on at the end of class, and stretched
my arms out in front of me, flexing my stiff fingers. Edward chuckled beside me.
<div class="bookquote">``Well, that was interesting,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Edward</b></font>) murmured. His (<font color='blue'><b>Edward</b></font>) voice was dark and his (<font color='blue'><b>Edward</b></font>) eyes were cautious.
<div class="bookquote">``Umm,''  (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div>was all I was able to respond.
<div class="bookquote">``Shall we?''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Edward</b></font>) asked, rising fluidly.
I almost groaned. Time for Gym. I stood with care, worried my balance might have been affected by the
strange new intensity between us.
He (<font color='blue'><b>Edward</b></font>) walked me to my next class in silence and paused at the door; I turned to say goodbye. His (<font color='blue'><b>Edward</b></font>) face
startled me  his (<font color='blue'><b>Edward</b></font>) expression was torn, almost pained, and so fiercely beautiful that the ache to touch him (<font color='blue'><b>Edward</b></font>)
flared as strong as before. My goodbye stuck in my throat.
He (<font color='blue'><b>Edward</b></font>) raised his (<font color='blue'><b>Edward</b></font>) hand, hesitant, conflict raging in his (<font color='blue'><b>Edward</b></font>) eyes, and then swiftly brushed the length of my
cheekbone with his (<font color='blue'><b>Edward</b></font>) fingertips. His (<font color='blue'><b>Edward</b></font>) skin was as icy as ever, but the trail his (<font color='blue'><b>Edward</b></font>) fingers left on my skin was
alarmingly warm  like I'd been burned, but didn't feel the pain of it yet.
He (<font color='blue'><b>Edward</b></font>) turned without a word and strode quickly away from me.
I walked into the gym, lightheaded and wobbly. I drifted to the locker room, changing in a trancelike
state, only vaguely aware that there were other people surrounding me. Reality didn't fully set in until I
was handed a racket. It wasn't heavy, yet it felt very unsafe in my hand. I could see a few of the other
kids in class eyeing me furtively. Coach Clapp ordered us to pair up into teams.
Mercifully, some vestiges of Mike's chivalry still survived; he (<font color='blue'><b>Mike</b></font>) came to stand beside me.
<div class="bookquote">``Do you want to be a team?''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``Thanks, Mike  you don't have to do this, you know.''  (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div>I grimaced apologetically.
<div class="bookquote">``Don't worry, I'll keep out of your way.''  (<font color='red'><b>He</b></font>)</div>He (<font color='blue'><b>Mike</b></font>) grinned. Sometimes it was so easy to like Mike.
It didn't go smoothly. I somehow managed to hit myself in the head with my racket and clip Mike's
shoulder on the same swing. I spent the rest of the hour in the back corner of the court, the racket held
safely behind my back. Despite being handicapped by me, Mike was pretty good; he (<font color='blue'><b>Mike</b></font>) won three games
out of four singlehandedly. He (<font color='blue'><b>Mike</b></font>) gave me an unearned high five when the coach finally blew the whistle
ending class.
<div class="bookquote">``So,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>coach</b></font>) said as we walked off the court.
<div class="bookquote">``So what?''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``You and Cullen, huh?''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>coach</b></font>) asked, his (<font color='blue'><b>coach</b></font>) tone rebellious. My previous feeling of affection disappeared.
<div class="bookquote">``That's none of your business, Mike,''  (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div>I warned, internally cursing Jessica straight to the fiery pits of
Hades.
<div class="bookquote">``I don't like it,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>coach</b></font>) muttered anyway.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``You don't have to,''  (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div>I snapped.
<div class="bookquote">``He (<font color='blue'><b>Mike</b></font>) looks at you like like you're something to eat,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>coach</b></font>) continued, ignoring me.
I choked back the hysteria that threatened to explode, but a small giggle managed to get out despite my
efforts. He (<font color='blue'><b>coach</b></font>) glowered at me. I waved and fled to the locker room.
I dressed quickly, something stronger than butterflies battering recklessly against the walls of my stomach,
my argument with Mike already a distant memory. I was wondering if Edward would be waiting, or if I
should meet him (<font color='blue'><b>Edward</b></font>) at his (<font color='blue'><b>Edward</b></font>) car. What if his (<font color='blue'><b>Edward</b></font>) family was there? I felt a wave of real terror. Did they know that I
knew? Was I supposed to know that they knew that I knew, or not?
By the time I walked out of the gym, I had just about decided to walk straight home without even looking
toward the parking lot. But my worries were unnecessary. Edward was waiting, leaning casually against
the side of the gym, his (<font color='blue'><b>Edward</b></font>) breathtaking face untroubled now. As I walked to his (<font color='blue'><b>Edward</b></font>) side, I felt a peculiar sense
of release.
<div class="bookquote">``Hi,''  (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div>I breathed, smiling hugely.
<div class="bookquote">``Hello.''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>His (<font color='blue'><b>Edward</b></font>) answering smile was brilliant. <div class="bookquote">``How was Gym?''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>My face fell a tiny bit. <div class="bookquote">``Fine,''  (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div>I lied.
<div class="bookquote">``Really?''  (<font color='red'><b>He</b></font>)</div>He (<font color='blue'><b>Edward</b></font>) was unconvinced. His (<font color='blue'><b>Edward</b></font>) eyes shifted their focus slightly, looking over my shoulder and
narrowing. I glanced behind me to see Mike's back as he (<font color='blue'><b>Mike</b></font>) walked away.
<div class="bookquote">``What?''  (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div>I demanded.
His (<font color='blue'><b>Mike</b></font>) eyes slid back to mine, still tight. <div class="bookquote">``Newton's getting on my nerves.''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``You weren't listening again?''  (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div>I was horror-struck. All traces of my sudden good humor vanished.
<div class="bookquote">``How's your head?''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Mike</b></font>) asked innocently.
<div class="bookquote">``You're unbelievable!''  (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div>I turned, stomping away in the general direction of the parking lot, though I hadn't
ruled out walking at this point.
He (<font color='blue'><b>Mike</b></font>) kept up with me easily.
<div class="bookquote">``You were the one who mentioned how I'd never seen you in Gym  it made me curious.''  (<font color='red'><b>He</b></font>)</div>He (<font color='blue'><b>Mike</b></font>) didn't
sound repentant, so I ignored him (<font color='blue'><b>Mike</b></font>).
We walked in silence  a furious, embarrassed silence on my part  to his (<font color='blue'><b>Mike</b></font>) car. But I had to stop a few
steps away  a crowd of people, all boys, were surrounding it.
Then I realized they weren't surrounding the Volvo, they were actually circled around Rosalie's red
convertible, unmistakable lust in their eyes. None of them even looked up as Edward slid between them
to open his (<font color='blue'><b>Edward</b></font>) door. I climbed quickly in the passenger side, also unnoticed.
<div class="bookquote">``Ostentatious,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Edward</b></font>) muttered.
<div class="bookquote">``What kind of car is that?''  (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div>I asked.
<div class="bookquote">``An M3.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I don't speak Car and Driver.''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``It's a BMW.''  (<font color='red'><b>He</b></font>)</div>He (<font color='blue'><b>Edward</b></font>) rolled his (<font color='blue'><b>Edward</b></font>) eyes, not looking at me, trying to back out without running over the car
enthusiasts.
I nodded  I'd heard of that one.
<div class="bookquote">``Are you still angry?''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Edward</b></font>) asked as he (<font color='blue'><b>Edward</b></font>) carefully maneuvered his (<font color='blue'><b>Edward</b></font>) way out.
<div class="bookquote">``Definitely.''
 (<font color='red'><b>He</b></font>)</div>He (<font color='blue'><b>Edward</b></font>) sighed. <div class="bookquote">``Will you forgive me if I apologize?''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``Maybe if you mean it. And if you promise not to do it again,''  (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div>I insisted.
His (<font color='blue'><b>Edward</b></font>) eyes were suddenly shrewd. <div class="bookquote">``How about if I mean it, and I agree to let you drive Saturday?''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Edward</b></font>)
countered my conditions.
I considered, and decided it was probably the best offer I would get. <div class="bookquote">``Deal,''  (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div>I agreed.
<div class="bookquote">``Then I'm very sorry I upset you.''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>His (<font color='blue'><b>Edward</b></font>) eyes burned with sincerity for a protracted moment  playing
havoc with the rhythm of my heart  and then turned playful. <div class="bookquote">``And I'll be on your doorstep bright and
early Saturday morning.''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``Um, it doesn't help with the Charlie situation if an unexplained Volvo is left in the driveway.''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>His (<font color='blue'><b>Edward</b></font>) smile was condescending now. <div class="bookquote">``I wasn't intending to bring a car.''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``How ''
 (<font color='red'><b>He</b></font>)</div>He (<font color='blue'><b>Edward</b></font>) cut me off. <div class="bookquote">``Don't worry about it. I'll be there, no car.''
 (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div>I let it go. I had a more pressing question.
<div class="bookquote">``Is it later yet?''  (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div>I asked significantly.
He (<font color='blue'><b>Edward</b></font>) frowned. <div class="bookquote">``I supposed it is later.''
 (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div>I kept my expression polite as I waited.
He (<font color='blue'><b>Edward</b></font>) stopped the car. I looked up, surprised  of course we were already at Charlie's house, parked
behind the truck. It was easier to ride with him (<font color='blue'><b>Charlie</b></font>) if I only looked when it was over. When I looked back at
him (<font color='blue'><b>Charlie</b></font>), he (<font color='blue'><b>Charlie</b></font>) was staring at me, measuring with his (<font color='blue'><b>Charlie</b></font>) eyes.
<div class="bookquote">``And you still want to know why you can't see me hunt?''  (<font color='red'><b>He</b></font>)</div>He (<font color='blue'><b>Charlie</b></font>) seemed solemn, but I thought I saw a trace
of humor deep in his (<font color='blue'><b>Charlie</b></font>) eyes.
<div class="bookquote">``Well,''  (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div>I clarified, <div class="bookquote">``I was mostly wondering about your reaction.''
 (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``Did I frighten you?''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>Yes, there was definitely humor there.
<div class="bookquote">``No,''  (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div>I lied. He (<font color='blue'><b>Charlie</b></font>) didn't buy it.
<div class="bookquote">``I apologize for scaring you,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Charlie</b></font>) persisted with a slight smile, but then all evidence of teasing disappeared.
<div class="bookquote">``It was just the very thought of you being there while we hunted.''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>His (<font color='blue'><b>Charlie</b></font>) jaw tightened.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``That would be bad?''
 (<font color='red'><b>He</b></font>)</div>He (<font color='blue'><b>Charlie</b></font>) spoke from between clenched teeth. <div class="bookquote">``Extremely.''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``Because ?''
 (<font color='red'><b>He</b></font>)</div>He (<font color='blue'><b>Charlie</b></font>) took a deep breath and stared through the windshield at the thick, rolling clouds that seemed to press
down, almost within reach.
<div class="bookquote">``When we hunt,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Charlie</b></font>) spoke slowly, unwillingly, <div class="bookquote">``we give ourselves over to our senses govern less with
our minds. Especially our sense of smell. If you were anywhere near me when I lost control that way''
 (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>He (<font color='blue'><b>Charlie</b></font>) shook his (<font color='blue'><b>Charlie</b></font>) head, still gazing morosely at the heavy clouds.
I kept my expression firmly under control, expecting the swift flash of his (<font color='blue'><b>Charlie</b></font>) eyes to judge my reaction that
soon followed. My face gave nothing away.
But our eyes held, and the silence deepened  and changed. Flickers of the electricity I'd felt this
afternoon began to charge the atmosphere as he (<font color='blue'><b>Charlie</b></font>) gazed unrelentingly into my eyes. It wasn't until my head
started to swim that I realized I wasn't breathing. When I drew in a jagged breath, breaking the stillness,
he (<font color='blue'><b>Charlie</b></font>) closed his (<font color='blue'><b>Charlie</b></font>) eyes.
<div class="bookquote">``Bella, I think you should go inside now.''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>His (<font color='blue'><b>Charlie</b></font>) low voice was rough, his (<font color='blue'><b>Charlie</b></font>) eyes on the clouds again.
I opened the door, and the arctic draft that burst into the car helped clear my head. Afraid I might
stumble in my woozy state, I stepped carefully out of the car and shut the door behind me without
looking back. The whir of the automatic window unrolling made me turn.
<div class="bookquote">``Oh, Bella?''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Charlie</b></font>) called after me, his (<font color='blue'><b>Charlie</b></font>) voice more even. He (<font color='blue'><b>Charlie</b></font>) leaned toward the open window with a faint
smile on his (<font color='blue'><b>Charlie</b></font>) lips.
<div class="bookquote">``Yes?''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``Tomorrow it's my turn.''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``Your turn to what?''
 (<font color='red'><b>He</b></font>)</div>He (<font color='blue'><b>Charlie</b></font>) smiled wider, flashing his (<font color='blue'><b>Charlie</b></font>) gleaming teeth. <div class="bookquote">``Ask the questions.''
 (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>And then he (<font color='blue'><b>Charlie</b></font>) was gone, the car speeding down the street and disappearing around the corner before I
could even collect my thoughts. I smiled as I walked to the house. It was clear he (<font color='blue'><b>Charlie</b></font>) was planning to see me
tomorrow, if nothing else.
That night Edward starred in my dreams, as usual. However, the climate of my unconsciousness had
changed. It thrilled with the same electricity that had charged the afternoon, and I tossed and turned
restlessly, waking often. It was only in the early hours of the morning that I finally sank into an exhausted,
dreamless sleep.
When I woke I was still tired, but edgy as well. I pulled on my brown turtleneck and the inescapable
jeans, sighing as I daydreamed of spaghetti straps and shorts. Breakfast was the usual, quiet event I
expected. Charlie fried eggs for himself; I had my bowl of cereal. I wondered if he (<font color='blue'><b>Charlie</b></font>) had forgotten about
this Saturday. He (<font color='blue'><b>Charlie</b></font>) answered my unspoken question as he (<font color='blue'><b>Charlie</b></font>) stood up to take his (<font color='blue'><b>Charlie</b></font>) plate to the sink.
<div class="bookquote">``About this Saturday''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Charlie</b></font>) began, walking across the kitchen and turning on the faucet.
I cringed. <div class="bookquote">``Yes, Dad?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Are you still set on going to Seattle?''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Charlie</b></font>) asked.
<div class="bookquote">``That was the plan.''  (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div>I grimaced, wishing he (<font color='blue'><b>Charlie</b></font>) hadn't brought it up so I wouldn't have to compose careful
half-truths.
He (<font color='blue'><b>Charlie</b></font>) squeezed some dish soap onto his (<font color='blue'><b>Charlie</b></font>) plate and swirled it around with the brush. <div class="bookquote">``And you're sure you
can't make it back in time for the dance?''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``I'm not going to the dance, Dad.''  (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div>I glared.
<div class="bookquote">``Didn't anyone ask you?''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Charlie</b></font>) asked, trying to hide his (<font color='blue'><b>Charlie</b></font>) concern by focusing on rinsing the plate.
I sidestepped the minefield. <div class="bookquote">``It's a girl's choice.''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``Oh.''  (<font color='red'><b>He</b></font>)</div>He (<font color='blue'><b>Charlie</b></font>) frowned as he (<font color='blue'><b>Charlie</b></font>) dried his (<font color='blue'><b>Charlie</b></font>) plate.
I sympathized with him (<font color='blue'><b>Charlie</b></font>). It must be a hard thing, to be a father; living in fear that your daughter would
meet a boy she (<font color='blue'><b>daughter</b></font>) liked, but also having to worry if she (<font color='blue'><b>daughter</b></font>) didn't. How ghastly it would be, I thought,
shuddering, if Charlie had even the slightest inkling of exactly what I did like.
Charlie left then, with a goodbye wave, and I went upstairs to brush my teeth and gather my books.
When I heard the cruiser pull away, I could only wait a few seconds before I had to peek out of my
window. The silver car was already there, waiting in Charlie's spot on the driveway. I bounded down the
stairs and out the front door, wondering how long this bizarre routine would continue. I never wanted it to
end.
He (<font color='blue'><b>Charlie</b></font>) waited in the car, not appearing to watch as I shut the door behind me without bothering to lock the
dead-bolt. I walked to the car, pausing shyly before opening the door and stepping in. He (<font color='blue'><b>Charlie</b></font>) was smiling,
relaxed  and, as usual, perfect and beautiful to an excruciating degree.
<div class="bookquote">``Good morning.''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>His (<font color='blue'><b>Charlie</b></font>) voice was silky. <div class="bookquote">``How are you today?''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>His (<font color='blue'><b>Charlie</b></font>) eyes roamed over my face, as if his (<font color='blue'><b>Charlie</b></font>)
question was something more than simple courtesy.
<div class="bookquote">``Good, thank you.''  (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div>I was always good  much more than good  when I was near him (<font color='blue'><b>Charlie</b></font>).
His (<font color='blue'><b>Charlie</b></font>) gaze lingered on the circles under my eyes. <div class="bookquote">``You look tired.''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``I couldn't sleep,''  (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div>I confessed, automatically swinging my hair around my shoulder to provide some
measure of cover.
<div class="bookquote">``Neither could I,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Charlie</b></font>) teased as he (<font color='blue'><b>Charlie</b></font>) started the engine. I was becoming used to the quiet purr. I was sure
the roar of my truck would scare me, whenever I got to drive it again.
I laughed. <div class="bookquote">``I guess that's right. I suppose I slept just a little bit more than you did.''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``I'd wager you did.''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``So what did you do last night?''  (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div>I asked.
He (<font color='blue'><b>Charlie</b></font>) chuckled. <div class="bookquote">``Not a chance. It's my day to ask questions.''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``Oh, that's right. What do you want to know?''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>My forehead creased. I couldn't imagine anything about
me that could be in any way interesting to him (<font color='blue'><b>Charlie</b></font>).
<div class="bookquote">``What's your favorite color?''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Charlie</b></font>) asked, his (<font color='blue'><b>Charlie</b></font>) face grave.

<p/>I rolled my eyes. <div class="bookquote">``It changes from day to day.''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``What's your favorite color today?''  (<font color='red'><b>He</b></font>)</div>He (<font color='blue'><b>Charlie</b></font>) was still solemn.
<div class="bookquote">``Probably brown.''  (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div>I tended to dress according to my mood.
He (<font color='blue'><b>Charlie</b></font>) snorted, dropping his (<font color='blue'><b>Charlie</b></font>) serious expression. <div class="bookquote">``Brown?''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Charlie</b></font>) asked skeptically.
<div class="bookquote">``Sure. Brown is warm. I miss brown. Everything that's supposed to be brown  tree trunks, rocks, dirt
 is all covered up with squashy green stuff here,''  (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div>I complained.
He (<font color='blue'><b>Charlie</b></font>) seemed fascinated by my little rant. He (<font color='blue'><b>Charlie</b></font>) considered for a moment, staring into my eyes.
<div class="bookquote">``You're right,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Charlie</b></font>) decided, serious again. <div class="bookquote">``Brown is warm.''  (<font color='red'><b>He</b></font>)</div>He (<font color='blue'><b>Charlie</b></font>) reached over, swiftly, but somehow still
hesitantly, to sweep my hair back behind my shoulder.
We were at the school by now. He (<font color='blue'><b>Charlie</b></font>) turned back to me as he (<font color='blue'><b>Charlie</b></font>) pulled into a parking space.
<div class="bookquote">``What music is in your CD player right now?''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Charlie</b></font>) asked, his (<font color='blue'><b>Charlie</b></font>) face as somber as if he (<font color='blue'><b>Charlie</b></font>)'d asked for a murder
confession.
I realized I'd never removed the CD Phil had given me. When I said the name of the band, he (<font color='blue'><b>Phil</b></font>) smiled
crookedly, a peculiar expression in his (<font color='blue'><b>Phil</b></font>) eyes. He (<font color='blue'><b>Phil</b></font>) flipped open a compartment under his (<font color='blue'><b>Phil</b></font>) car's CD player,
pulled out one of thirty or so CDs that were jammed into the small space, and handed it to me,
<div class="bookquote">``Debussy to this?''  (<font color='red'><b>me</b></font>)</div>He (<font color='blue'><b>Phil</b></font>) raised an eyebrow.
It was the same CD. I examined the familiar cover art, keeping my eyes down.
It continued like that for the rest of the day. While he (<font color='blue'><b>Phil</b></font>) walked me to English, when he (<font color='blue'><b>Phil</b></font>) met me after
Spanish, all through the lunch hour, he (<font color='blue'><b>Phil</b></font>) questioned me relentlessly about every insignificant detail of my
existence. Movies I'd liked and hated, the few places I'd been and the many places I wanted to go, and
books  endlessly books.
I couldn't remember the last time I'd talked so much. More often than not, I felt self-conscious, certain I
must be boring him (<font color='blue'><b>Phil</b></font>). But the absolute absorption of his (<font color='blue'><b>Phil</b></font>) face, and his (<font color='blue'><b>Phil</b></font>) never-ending stream of questions,
compelled me to continue. Mostly his (<font color='blue'><b>Phil</b></font>) questions were easy, only a very few triggering my easy blushes.
But when I did flush, it brought on a whole new round of questions.
Such as the time he (<font color='blue'><b>Phil</b></font>) asked my favorite gemstone, and I blurted out topaz before thinking. He (<font color='blue'><b>Phil</b></font>)'d been
flinging questions at me with such speed that I felt like I was taking one of those psychiatric tests where
you answer with the first word that comes to mind. I was sure he (<font color='blue'><b>Phil</b></font>) would have continued down whatever
mental list he (<font color='blue'><b>Phil</b></font>) was following, except for the blush. My face reddened because, until very recently, my
favorite gemstone was garnet. It was impossible, while staring back into his (<font color='blue'><b>Phil</b></font>) topaz eyes, not to remember
the reason for the switch. And, naturally, he (<font color='blue'><b>Phil</b></font>) wouldn't rest until I'd admitted why I was embarrassed.
<div class="bookquote">``Tell me,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Phil</b></font>) finally commanded after persuasion failed  failed only because I kept my eyes safely
away from his (<font color='blue'><b>Phil</b></font>) face.
<div class="bookquote">``It's the color of your eyes today,''  (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div>I sighed, surrendering, staring down at my hands as I fiddled with a
piece of my hair. <div class="bookquote">``I suppose if you asked me in two weeks I'd say onyx.''  (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div>I'd given more information than
necessary in my unwilling honesty, and I worried it would provoke the strange anger that flared whenever
I slipped and revealed too clearly how obsessed I was.

<p/>But his (<font color='blue'><b>Phil</b></font>) pause was very short.
<div class="bookquote">``What kinds of flowers do you prefer?''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Phil</b></font>) fired off.
I sighed in relief, and continued with the psychoanalysis.
Biology was a complication again. Edward had continued with his (<font color='blue'><b>Edward</b></font>) quizzing up until Mr. Banner entered
the room, dragging the audiovisual frame again. As the teacher approached the light switch, I noticed
Edward slide his (<font color='blue'><b>Edward</b></font>) chair slightly farther away from mine. It didn't help. As soon as the room was dark,
there was the same electric spark, the same restless craving to stretch my hand across the short space
and touch his (<font color='blue'><b>Edward</b></font>) cold skin, as yesterday.
I leaned forward on the table, resting my chin on my folded arms, my hidden fingers gripping the table's
edge as I fought to ignore the irrational longing that unsettled me. I didn't look at him (<font color='blue'><b>Edward</b></font>), afraid that if he (<font color='blue'><b>Edward</b></font>) was
looking at me, it would only make self-control that much harder. I sincerely tried to watch the movie, but
at the end of the hour I had no idea what I'd just seen. I sighed in relief again when Mr. Banner turned the
lights on, finally glancing at Edward; he (<font color='blue'><b>Edward</b></font>) was looking at me, his (<font color='blue'><b>Edward</b></font>) eyes ambivalent.
He (<font color='blue'><b>Edward</b></font>) rose in silence and then stood still, waiting for me. We walked toward the gym in silence, like
yesterday. And, also like yesterday, he (<font color='blue'><b>Edward</b></font>) touched my face wordlessly  this time with the back of his (<font color='blue'><b>Edward</b></font>) cool
hand, stroking once from my temple to my jaw  before he (<font color='blue'><b>Edward</b></font>) turned and walked away.
Gym passed quickly as I watched Mike's one-man badminton show. He (<font color='blue'><b>Mike</b></font>) didn't speak to me today, either
in response to my vacant expression or because he (<font color='blue'><b>Mike</b></font>) was still angry about our squabble yesterday.
Somewhere, in a corner of my mind, I felt bad about that. But I couldn't concentrate on him (<font color='blue'><b>Mike</b></font>).
I hurried to change afterward, ill at ease, knowing the faster I moved, the sooner I would be with
Edward. The pressure made me more clumsy than usual, but eventually I made it out the door, feeling the
same release when I saw him (<font color='blue'><b>Edward</b></font>) standing there, a wide smile automatically spreading across my face. He (<font color='blue'><b>Edward</b></font>)
smiled in reaction before launching into more cross-examination.
His (<font color='blue'><b>Edward</b></font>) questions were different now, though, not as easily answered. He (<font color='blue'><b>Edward</b></font>) wanted to know what I missed
about home, insisting on descriptions of anything he (<font color='blue'><b>Edward</b></font>) wasn't familiar with. We sat in front of Charlie's
house for hours, as the sky darkened and rain plummeted around us in a sudden deluge.
I tried to describe impossible things like the scent of creosote  bitter, slightly resinous, but still pleasant
 the high, keening sound of the cicadas in July, the feathery barrenness of the trees, the very size of the
sky, extending white-blue from horizon to horizon, barely interrupted by the low mountains covered with
purple volcanic rock. The hardest thing to explain was why it was so beautiful to me  to justify a
beauty that didn't depend on the sparse, spiny vegetation that often looked half dead, a beauty that had
more to do with the exposed shape of the land, with the shallow bowls of valleys between the craggy
hills, and the way they held on to the sun. I found myself using my hands as I tried to describe it to him (<font color='blue'><b>my</b></font>).
His (<font color='blue'><b>my</b></font>) quiet, probing questions kept me talking freely, forgetting, in the dim light of the storm, to be
embarrassed for monopolizing the conversation. Finally, when I had finished detailing my cluttered room
at home, he (<font color='blue'><b>my</b></font>) paused instead of responding with another question.
<div class="bookquote">``Are you finished?''  (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div>I asked in relief.
<div class="bookquote">``Not even close  but your father will be home soon.''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``Charlie!''  (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div>I suddenly recalled his (<font color='blue'><b>my</b></font>) existence, and sighed. I looked out at the rain-darkened sky, but it gave
nothing away. <div class="bookquote">``How late is it?''  (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div>I wondered out loud as I glanced at the clock. I was surprised by the time

 Charlie would be driving home now.
<div class="bookquote">``It's twilight,''  (<font color='red'><b>Edward/Edward Cullen/Cullen</b></font>)</div>Edward murmured, looking at the western horizon, obscured as it was with clouds. His (<font color='blue'><b>Edward</b></font>)
voice was thoughtful, as if his (<font color='blue'><b>Edward</b></font>) mind were somewhere far away. I stared at him (<font color='blue'><b>Edward</b></font>) as he (<font color='blue'><b>Edward</b></font>) gazed unseeingly out
the windshield.
I was still staring when his (<font color='blue'><b>Edward</b></font>) eyes suddenly shifted back to mine.
<div class="bookquote">``It's the safest time of day for us,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Edward</b></font>) said, answering the unspoken question in my eyes. <div class="bookquote">``The easiest
time. But also the saddest, in a way the end of another day, the return of the night. Darkness is so
predictable, don't you think?''  (<font color='red'><b>He</b></font>)</div>He (<font color='blue'><b>Edward</b></font>) smiled wistfully.
<div class="bookquote">``I like the night. Without the dark, we'd never see the stars.''  (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div>I frowned. <div class="bookquote">``Not that you see them here
much.''
 (<font color='red'><b>He</b></font>)</div>He (<font color='blue'><b>Edward</b></font>) laughed, and the mood abruptly lightened.
<div class="bookquote">``Charlie will be here in a few minutes. So, unless you want to tell him (<font color='blue'><b>Charlie</b></font>) that you'll be with me Saturday''
 (<font color='red'><b>He</b></font>)</div>He (<font color='blue'><b>Edward</b></font>) raised one eyebrow.
<div class="bookquote">``Thanks, but no thanks.''  (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div>I gathered my books, realizing I was stiff from sitting still so long. <div class="bookquote">``So is it my
turn tomorrow, then?''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``Certainly not!''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>His (<font color='blue'><b>Edward</b></font>) face was teasingly outraged. <div class="bookquote">``I told you I wasn't done, didn't I?''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``What more is there?''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``You'll find out tomorrow.''  (<font color='red'><b>He</b></font>)</div>He (<font color='blue'><b>Edward</b></font>) reached across to open my door for me, and his (<font color='blue'><b>Edward</b></font>) sudden proximity sent
my heart into frenzied palpitations.
But his (<font color='blue'><b>Edward</b></font>) hand froze on the handle.
<div class="bookquote">``Not good,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Edward</b></font>) muttered.
<div class="bookquote">``What is it?''  (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div>I was surprised to see that his (<font color='blue'><b>Edward</b></font>) jaw was clenched, his (<font color='blue'><b>Edward</b></font>) eyes disturbed.
He (<font color='blue'><b>Edward</b></font>) glanced at me for a brief second. <div class="bookquote">``Another complication,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Edward</b></font>) said glumly.
He (<font color='blue'><b>Edward</b></font>) flung the door open in one swift movement, and then moved, almost cringed, swiftly away from me.
The flash of headlights through the rain caught my attention as a dark car pulled up to the curb just a few
feet away, facing us.
<div class="bookquote">``Charlie's around the corner,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Edward</b></font>) warned, staring through the downpour at the other vehicle.
I hopped out at once, despite my confusion and curiosity. The rain was louder as it glanced off my
jacket.
I tried to make out the shapes in the front seat of the other car, but it was too dark. I could see Edward
illuminated in the glare of the new car's headlights; he (<font color='blue'><b>Edward</b></font>) was still staring ahead, his (<font color='blue'><b>Edward</b></font>) gaze locked on
something or someone I couldn't see. His (<font color='blue'><b>Edward</b></font>) expression was a strange mix of frustration and defiance.
Then he (<font color='blue'><b>Edward</b></font>) revved the engine, and the tires squealed against the wet pavement. The Volvo was out of sight
in seconds.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Hey, Bella,''  (<font color='red'><b>the driver</b></font>)</div>called a familiar, husky voice from the driver's side of the little black car.
<div class="bookquote">``Jacob?''  (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div>I asked, squinting through the rain. Just then, Charlie's cruiser swung around the corner, his (<font color='blue'><b>Charlie</b></font>)
lights shining on the occupants of the car in front of me.
Jacob was already climbing out, his (<font color='blue'><b>Jacob</b></font>) wide grin visible even through the darkness. In the passenger seat
was a much older man, a heavyset man with a memorable face  a face that overflowed, the cheeks
resting against his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) shoulders, with creases running through the russet skin like an old leather jacket. And
the surprisingly familiar eyes, black eyes that seemed at the same time both too young and too ancient for
the broad face they were set in. Jacob's father, Billy Black. I knew him (<font color='blue'><b>Black</b></font>) immediately, though in the more
than five years since I'd seen him (<font color='blue'><b>Black</b></font>) last I'd managed to forget his (<font color='blue'><b>Black</b></font>) name when Charlie had spoken of him (<font color='blue'><b>Charlie</b></font>) my
first day here. He (<font color='blue'><b>Charlie</b></font>) was staring at me, scrutinizing my face, so I smiled tentatively at him (<font color='blue'><b>Charlie</b></font>). His (<font color='blue'><b>Charlie</b></font>) eyes were
wide, as if in shock or fear, his (<font color='blue'><b>Charlie</b></font>) nostrils flared. My smile faded.
Another complication, Edward had said.
Billy still stared at me with intense, anxious eyes. I groaned internally. Had Billy recognized Edward so
easily? Could he (<font color='blue'><b>Billy</b></font>) really believe the impossible legends his (<font color='blue'><b>Billy</b></font>) son had scoffed at?
The answer was clear in Billy's eyes. Yes. Yes, he (<font color='blue'><b>Billy</b></font>) could.

<p/>12. BALANCING

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Billy!''  (<font color='red'><b>Charlie</b></font>)</div>Charlie called as soon as he (<font color='blue'><b>Charlie</b></font>) got out of the car.
I turned toward the house, beckoning to Jacob as I ducked under the porch. I heard Charlie greeting
them loudly behind me.
<div class="bookquote">``I'm going to pretend I didn't see you behind the wheel, Jake,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Charlie</b></font>) said disapprovingly.
<div class="bookquote">``We get permits early on the rez,''  (<font color='red'><b>Jacob/Jacob Black</b></font>)</div>Jacob said while I unlocked the door and flicked on the porch light.
<div class="bookquote">``Sure you do,''  (<font color='red'><b>Charlie</b></font>)</div>Charlie laughed.
<div class="bookquote">``I have to get around somehow.''  (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div>I recognized Billy's resonant voice easily, despite the years. The sound
of it made me feel suddenly younger, a child.
I went inside, leaving the door open behind me and turning on lights before I hung up my jacket. Then I
stood in the door, watching anxiously as Charlie and Jacob helped Billy out of the car and into his (<font color='blue'><b>Charlie</b></font>)
wheelchair.
I backed out of the way as the three of them hurried in, shaking off the rain.
<div class="bookquote">``This is a surprise,''  (<font color='red'><b>Charlie</b></font>)</div>Charlie was saying.
<div class="bookquote">``It's been too long,''  (<font color='red'><b>Billy/Billy Black</b></font>)</div>Billy answered. <div class="bookquote">``I hope it's not a bad time.''  (<font color='red'><b>me</b></font>)</div>His (<font color='blue'><b>Billy</b></font>) dark eyes flashed up to me again,
their expression unreadable.
<div class="bookquote">``No, it's great. I hope you can stay for the game.''
 (<font color='red'><b>Jacob/Jacob Black</b></font>)</div>Jacob grinned. <div class="bookquote">``I think that's the plan  our TV broke last week.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Billy/Billy Black</b></font>)</div><p/>Billy made a face at his (<font color='blue'><b>Billy</b></font>) son. <div class="bookquote">``And, of course, Jacob was anxious to see Bella again,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Billy</b></font>) added. Jacob
scowled and ducked his (<font color='blue'><b>Jacob</b></font>) head while I fought back a surge of remorse. Maybe I'd been too convincing on
the beach.
<div class="bookquote">``Are you hungry?''  (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div>I asked, turning toward the kitchen. I was eager to escape Billy's searching gaze.
<div class="bookquote">``Naw, we ate just before we came,''  (<font color='red'><b>Jacob/Jacob Black</b></font>)</div>Jacob answered.
<div class="bookquote">``How about you, Charlie?''  (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div>I called over my shoulder as I fled around the corner.
<div class="bookquote">``Sure,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Jacob</b></font>) replied, his (<font color='blue'><b>Jacob</b></font>) voice moving in the direction of the front room and the TV. I could hear Billy's
chair follow.
The grilled cheese sandwiches were in the frying pan and I was slicing up a tomato when I sensed
someone behind me.
<div class="bookquote">``So, how are things?''  (<font color='red'><b>Jacob/Jacob Black</b></font>)</div>Jacob asked.
<div class="bookquote">``Pretty good.''  (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div>I smiled. His (<font color='blue'><b>Jacob</b></font>) enthusiasm was hard to resist. <div class="bookquote">``How about you? Did you finish your car?''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``No.''  (<font color='red'><b>He</b></font>)</div>He (<font color='blue'><b>Jacob</b></font>) frowned. <div class="bookquote">``I still need parts. We borrowed that one.''  (<font color='red'><b>He</b></font>)</div>He (<font color='blue'><b>Jacob</b></font>) pointed with his (<font color='blue'><b>Jacob</b></font>) thumb in the direction
of the front yard.
<div class="bookquote">``Sorry. I haven't seen any what was it you were looking for?''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``Master cylinder.''  (<font color='red'><b>He</b></font>)</div>He (<font color='blue'><b>Jacob</b></font>) grinned. <div class="bookquote">``Is something wrong with the truck?''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Jacob</b></font>) added suddenly.
<div class="bookquote">``No.''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``Oh. I just wondered because you weren't driving it.''
 (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div>I stared down at the pan, pulling up the edge of a sandwich to check the bottom side. <div class="bookquote">``I got a ride with a
friend.''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``Nice ride.''  (<font color='red'><b>Jacob/Jacob Black</b></font>)</div>Jacob's voice was admiring. <div class="bookquote">``I didn't recognize the driver, though. I thought I knew most of
the kids around here.''
 (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div>I nodded noncommittally, keeping my eyes down as I flipped sandwiches.
<div class="bookquote">``My dad seemed to know him (<font color='blue'><b>dad</b></font>) from somewhere.''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``Jacob, could you hand me some plates? They're in the cupboard over the sink.''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``Sure.''
 (<font color='red'><b>He</b></font>)</div>He (<font color='blue'><b>Jacob</b></font>) got the plates in silence. I hoped he (<font color='blue'><b>Jacob</b></font>) would let it drop now.
<div class="bookquote">``So who was it?''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Jacob</b></font>) asked, setting two plates on the counter next to me.
I sighed in defeat. <div class="bookquote">``Edward Cullen.''
 (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>To my surprise, he (<font color='blue'><b>Jacob</b></font>) laughed. I glanced up at him (<font color='blue'><b>Jacob</b></font>). He (<font color='blue'><b>Jacob</b></font>) looked a little embarrassed.
<div class="bookquote">``Guess that explains it, then,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Jacob</b></font>) said. <div class="bookquote">``I wondered why my dad was acting so strange.''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``That's right.''  (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div>I faked an innocent expression. <div class="bookquote">``He (<font color='blue'><b>dad</b></font>) doesn't like the Cullens.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Superstitious old man,''  (<font color='red'><b>Jacob/Jacob Black</b></font>)</div>Jacob muttered under his (<font color='blue'><b>Jacob</b></font>) breath.
<div class="bookquote">``You don't think he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>)'d say anything to Charlie?''  (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div>I couldn't help asking, the words coming out in a low
rush.
Jacob stared at me for a moment, and I couldn't read the expression in his (<font color='blue'><b>Jacob</b></font>) dark eyes. <div class="bookquote">``I doubt it,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Jacob</b></font>)
finally answered. <div class="bookquote">``I think Charlie chewed him (<font color='blue'><b>Charlie</b></font>) out pretty good last time. They haven't spoken much since
 tonight is sort of a reunion, I think. I don't think he (<font color='blue'><b>Charlie</b></font>)'d bring it up again.''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``Oh,''  (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div>I said, trying to sound indifferent.
I stayed in the front room after I carried the food out to Charlie, pretending to watch the game while
Jacob chattered at me. I was really listening to the men's conversation, watching for any sign that Billy
was about to rat me out, trying to think of ways to stop him (<font color='blue'><b>Billy</b></font>) if he (<font color='blue'><b>Billy</b></font>) began.
It was a long night. I had a lot of homework that was going undone, but I was afraid to leave Billy alone
with Charlie. Finally, the game ended.
<div class="bookquote">``Are you and your friends coming back to the beach soon?''  (<font color='red'><b>Jacob/Jacob Black</b></font>)</div>Jacob asked as he (<font color='blue'><b>Jacob</b></font>) pushed his (<font color='blue'><b>Jacob</b></font>) father over
the lip of the threshold.
<div class="bookquote">``I'm not sure,''  (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div>I hedged.
<div class="bookquote">``That was fun, Charlie,''  (<font color='red'><b>Billy/Billy Black</b></font>)</div>Billy said.
<div class="bookquote">``Come up for the next game,''  (<font color='red'><b>Charlie</b></font>)</div>Charlie encouraged.
<div class="bookquote">``Sure, sure,''  (<font color='red'><b>Billy/Billy Black</b></font>)</div>Billy said. <div class="bookquote">``We'll be here. Have a good night.''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>His (<font color='blue'><b>Billy</b></font>) eyes shifted to mine, and his (<font color='blue'><b>Billy</b></font>) smile
disappeared. <div class="bookquote">``You take care, Bella,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Billy</b></font>) added seriously.
<div class="bookquote">``Thanks,''  (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div>I muttered, looking away.
I headed for the stairs while Charlie waved from the doorway.
<div class="bookquote">``Wait, Bella,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Charlie</b></font>) said.
I cringed. Had Billy gotten something in before I'd joined them in the living room?
But Charlie was relaxed, still grinning from the unexpected visit.
<div class="bookquote">``I didn't get a chance to talk to you tonight. How was your day?''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``Good.''  (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div>I hesitated with one foot on the first stair, searching for details I could safely share. <div class="bookquote">``My
badminton team won all four games.''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``Wow, I didn't know you could play badminton.''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``Well, actually I can't, but my partner is really good,''  (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div>I admitted.
<div class="bookquote">``Who is it?''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Charlie</b></font>) asked with token interest.
<div class="bookquote">``Um Mike Newton,''  (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div>I told him (<font color='blue'><b>Charlie</b></font>) reluctantly.
<div class="bookquote">``Oh yeah  you said you were friends with the Newton kid.''  (<font color='red'><b>He</b></font>)</div>He (<font color='blue'><b>Charlie</b></font>) perked up. <div class="bookquote">``Nice family.''  (<font color='red'><b>He</b></font>)</div>He (<font color='blue'><b>Charlie</b></font>) mused
for a minute. <div class="bookquote">``Why didn't you ask him (<font color='blue'><b>Newton</b></font>) to the dance this weekend?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Dad!''  (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div>I groaned. <div class="bookquote">``He (<font color='blue'><b>Dad</b></font>)'s kind of dating my friend Jessica. Besides, you know I can't dance.''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``Oh yeah,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Charlie</b></font>) muttered. Then he (<font color='blue'><b>Charlie</b></font>) smiled at me apologetically. <div class="bookquote">``So I guess it's good you'll be gone
Saturday I've made plans to go fishing with the guys from the station. The weather's supposed to be
real warm. But if you wanted to put your trip off till someone could go with you, I'd stay home. I know I
leave you here alone too much.''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``Dad, you're doing a great job.''  (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div>I smiled, hoping my relief didn't show. <div class="bookquote">``I've never minded being alone 
I'm too much like you.''  (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div>I winked at him (<font color='blue'><b>Charlie</b></font>), and he (<font color='blue'><b>Charlie</b></font>) smiled his (<font color='blue'><b>Charlie</b></font>) crinkly-eyed smile.

<p/>I slept better that night, too tired to dream again. When I woke to the pearl gray morning, my mood was
blissful. The tense evening with Billy and Jacob seemed harmless enough now; I decided to forget it
completely. I caught myself whistling while I was pulling the front part of my hair back into a barrette, and
later again as I skipped down the stairs. Charlie noticed.
<div class="bookquote">``You're cheerful this morning,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Charlie</b></font>) commented over breakfast.
I shrugged. <div class="bookquote">``It's Friday.''
 (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div>I hurried so I would be ready to go the second Charlie left. I had my bag ready, shoes on, teeth brushed,
but even though I rushed to the door as soon as I was sure Charlie would be out of sight, Edward was
faster. He (<font color='blue'><b>Edward</b></font>) was waiting in his (<font color='blue'><b>Edward</b></font>) shiny car, windows down, engine off.
I didn't hesitate this time, climbing in the passenger side quickly, the sooner to see his (<font color='blue'><b>passenger</b></font>) face. He (<font color='blue'><b>passenger</b></font>) grinned his (<font color='blue'><b>passenger</b></font>)
crooked smile at me, stopping my breath and my heart. I couldn't imagine how an angel could be any
more glorious. There was nothing about him (<font color='blue'><b>angel</b></font>) that could be improved upon.
<div class="bookquote">``How did you sleep?''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>angel</b></font>) asked. I wondered if he (<font color='blue'><b>angel</b></font>) had any idea how appealing his (<font color='blue'><b>angel</b></font>) voice was.
<div class="bookquote">``Fine. How was your night?''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``Pleasant.''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>His (<font color='blue'><b>angel</b></font>) smile was amused; I felt like I was missing an inside joke.
<div class="bookquote">``Can I ask what you did?''  (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div>I asked.
<div class="bookquote">``No.''  (<font color='red'><b>He</b></font>)</div>He (<font color='blue'><b>angel</b></font>) grinned. <div class="bookquote">``Today is still mine.''
 (<font color='red'><b>He</b></font>)</div>He (<font color='blue'><b>angel</b></font>) wanted to know about people today: more about Rene, her (<font color='blue'><b>angel</b></font>) hobbies, what we'd done in our free
time together. And then the one grandmother I'd known, my few school friends  embarrassing me
when he (<font color='blue'><b>Ren</b></font>) asked about boys I'd dated. I was relieved that I'd never really dated anyone, so that particular
conversation couldn't last long. He (<font color='blue'><b>Ren</b></font>) seemed as surprised as Jessica and Angela by my lack of romantic
history.
<div class="bookquote">``So you never met anyone you wanted?''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Ren</b></font>) asked in a serious tone that made me wonder what he (<font color='blue'><b>Ren</b></font>) was
thinking about.
I was grudgingly honest. <div class="bookquote">``Not in Phoenix.''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>His (<font color='blue'><b>Ren</b></font>) lips pressed together into a hard line.
We were in the cafeteria at this point. The day had sped by in the blur that was rapidly becoming routine.
I took advantage of his (<font color='blue'><b>Ren</b></font>) brief pause to take a bite of my bagel.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``I should have let you drive yourself today,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Ren</b></font>) announced, apropos of nothing, while I chewed.
<div class="bookquote">``Why?''  (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div>I demanded.
<div class="bookquote">``I'm leaving with Alice after lunch.''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``Oh.''  (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div>I blinked, bewildered and disappointed. <div class="bookquote">``That's okay, it's not that far of a walk.''
 (<font color='red'><b>He</b></font>)</div>He (<font color='blue'><b>Ren</b></font>) frowned at me impatiently. <div class="bookquote">``I'm not going to make you walk home. We'll go get your truck and leave
it here for you.''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``I don't have my key with me,''  (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div>I sighed. <div class="bookquote">``I really don't mind walking.''  (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div>What I minded was losing my time
with him (<font color='blue'><b>Ren</b></font>).
He (<font color='blue'><b>Ren</b></font>) shook his (<font color='blue'><b>Ren</b></font>) head. <div class="bookquote">``Your truck will be here, and the key will be in the ignition  unless you're afraid
someone might steal it.''  (<font color='red'><b>He</b></font>)</div>He (<font color='blue'><b>Ren</b></font>) laughed at the thought.
<div class="bookquote">``All right,''  (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div>I agreed, pursing my lips. I was pretty sure my key was in the pocket of a pair of jeans I wore
Wednesday, under a pile of clothes in the laundry room. Even if he (<font color='blue'><b>Ren</b></font>) broke into my house, or whatever he (<font color='blue'><b>Ren</b></font>)
was planning, he (<font color='blue'><b>Ren</b></font>)'d never find it. He (<font color='blue'><b>Ren</b></font>) seemed to feel the challenge in my consent. He (<font color='blue'><b>Ren</b></font>) smirked,
overconfident.
<div class="bookquote">``So where are you going?''  (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div>I asked as casually as I could manage.
<div class="bookquote">``Hunting,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Ren</b></font>) answered grimly. <div class="bookquote">``If I'm going to be alone with you tomorrow, I'm going to take whatever
precautions I can.''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>His (<font color='blue'><b>Ren</b></font>) face grew morose and pleading. <div class="bookquote">``You can always cancel, you know.''
 (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div>I looked down, afraid of the persuasive power of his (<font color='blue'><b>Ren</b></font>) eyes. I refused to be convinced to fear him (<font color='blue'><b>Ren</b></font>), no
matter how real the danger might be. It doesn't matter, I repeated in my head.
<div class="bookquote">``No,''  (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div>I whispered, glancing back at his (<font color='blue'><b>Ren</b></font>) face. <div class="bookquote">``I can't.''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``Perhaps you're right,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Ren</b></font>) murmured bleakly. His (<font color='blue'><b>Ren</b></font>) eyes seemed to darken in color as I watched.
I changed the subject. <div class="bookquote">``What time will I see you tomorrow?''  (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div>I asked, already depressed by the thought
of him (<font color='blue'><b>Ren</b></font>) leaving now.
<div class="bookquote">``That depends it's a Saturday, don't you want to sleep in?''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Ren</b></font>) offered.
<div class="bookquote">``No,''  (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div>I answered too fast. He (<font color='blue'><b>Ren</b></font>) restrained a smile.
<div class="bookquote">``The same time as usual, then,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Ren</b></font>) decided. <div class="bookquote">``Will Charlie be there?''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``No, he (<font color='blue'><b>Charlie</b></font>)'s fishing tomorrow.''  (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div>I beamed at the memory of how conveniently things had worked out.
His (<font color='blue'><b>Ren</b></font>) voice turned sharp. <div class="bookquote">``And if you don't come home, what will he (<font color='blue'><b>Charlie</b></font>) think?''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``I have no idea,''  (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div>I answered coolly. <div class="bookquote">``He (<font color='blue'><b>Charlie</b></font>) knows I've been meaning to do the laundry. Maybe he (<font color='blue'><b>Charlie</b></font>)'ll think I
fell in the washer.''
 (<font color='red'><b>He</b></font>)</div>He (<font color='blue'><b>Ren</b></font>) scowled at me and I scowled back. His (<font color='blue'><b>Ren</b></font>) anger was much more impressive than mine.
<div class="bookquote">``What are you hunting tonight?''  (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div>I asked when I was sure I had lost the glowering contest.
<div class="bookquote">``Whatever we find in the park. We aren't going far.''  (<font color='red'><b>He</b></font>)</div>He (<font color='blue'><b>Ren</b></font>) seemed bemused by my casual reference to his (<font color='blue'><b>Ren</b></font>)
secret realities.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Why are you going with Alice?''  (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div>I wondered.
<div class="bookquote">``Alice is the most supportive.''  (<font color='red'><b>He</b></font>)</div>He (<font color='blue'><b>Ren</b></font>) frowned as he (<font color='blue'><b>Ren</b></font>) spoke.
<div class="bookquote">``And the others?''  (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div>I asked timidly. <div class="bookquote">``What are they?''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>His (<font color='blue'><b>Ren</b></font>) brow puckered for a brief moment. <div class="bookquote">``Incredulous, for the most part.''
 (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div>I peeked quickly behind me at his (<font color='blue'><b>Ren</b></font>) family. They sat staring off in different directions, exactly the same as
the first time I'd seen them. Only now they were four; their beautiful, bronze-haired brother sat across
from me, his (<font color='blue'><b>brother</b></font>) golden eyes troubled.
<div class="bookquote">``They don't like me,''  (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div>I guessed.
<div class="bookquote">``That's not it,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>brother</b></font>) disagreed, but his (<font color='blue'><b>brother</b></font>) eyes were too innocent. <div class="bookquote">``They don't understand why I can't leave
you alone.''
 (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div>I grimaced. <div class="bookquote">``Neither do I, for that matter.''
 (<font color='red'><b>Edward/Edward Cullen/Cullen</b></font>)</div>Edward shook his (<font color='blue'><b>Edward</b></font>) head slowly, rolling his (<font color='blue'><b>Edward</b></font>) eyes toward the ceiling before he (<font color='blue'><b>Edward</b></font>) met my gaze again. <div class="bookquote">``I told
you  you don't see yourself clearly at all. You're not like anyone I've ever known. You fascinate me.''
 (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div>I glared at him (<font color='blue'><b>Edward</b></font>), sure he (<font color='blue'><b>Edward</b></font>) was teasing now.
He (<font color='blue'><b>Edward</b></font>) smiled as he (<font color='blue'><b>Edward</b></font>) deciphered my expression. <div class="bookquote">``Having the advantages I do,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Edward</b></font>) murmured, touching his (<font color='blue'><b>Edward</b></font>)
forehead discreetly, <div class="bookquote">``I have a better than average grasp of human nature. People are predictable. But
you you never do what I expect. You always take me by surprise.''
 (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>I looked away, my eyes wandering back to his (<font color='blue'><b>Edward</b></font>) family, embarrassed and dissatisfied. His (<font color='blue'><b>Edward</b></font>) words made me
feel like a science experiment. I wanted to laugh at myself for expecting anything else.
<div class="bookquote">``That part is easy enough to explain,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Edward</b></font>) continued. I felt his (<font color='blue'><b>Edward</b></font>) eyes on my face but I couldn't look at him (<font color='blue'><b>Edward</b></font>)
yet, afraid he (<font color='blue'><b>Edward</b></font>) might read the chagrin in my eyes. <div class="bookquote">``But there's more and it's not so easy to put into
words ''
 (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div>I was still staring at the Cullens while he (<font color='blue'><b>Edward</b></font>) spoke. Suddenly Rosalie, his (<font color='blue'><b>Edward</b></font>) blond and breathtaking sister,
turned to look at me. No, not to look  to glare, with dark, cold eyes. I wanted to look away, but her (<font color='blue'><b>Rosalie</b></font>)
gaze held me until Edward broke off mid-sentence and made an angry noise under his (<font color='blue'><b>Edward</b></font>) breath. It was
almost a hiss.
Rosalie turned her (<font color='blue'><b>Rosalie</b></font>) head, and I was relieved to be free. I looked back at Edward  and I knew he (<font color='blue'><b>Edward</b></font>) could
see the confusion and fear that widened my eyes.
His (<font color='blue'><b>Edward</b></font>) face was tight as he (<font color='blue'><b>Edward</b></font>) explained. <div class="bookquote">``I'm sorry about that. She (<font color='blue'><b>People</b></font>)'s just worried. You see it's dangerous for
more than just me if, after spending so much time with you so publicly''  (<font color='red'><b>He</b></font>)</div>He (<font color='blue'><b>Edward</b></font>) looked down.
<div class="bookquote">``If?''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``If this ends badly.''  (<font color='red'><b>He</b></font>)</div>He (<font color='blue'><b>Edward</b></font>) dropped his (<font color='blue'><b>Edward</b></font>) head into his (<font color='blue'><b>Edward</b></font>) hands, as he (<font color='blue'><b>Edward</b></font>) had that night in Port Angeles. His (<font color='blue'><b>Edward</b></font>)
anguish was plain; I yearned to comfort him (<font color='blue'><b>Edward</b></font>), but I was at a loss to know how. My hand reached toward
him (<font color='blue'><b>Edward</b></font>) involuntarily; quickly, though, I dropped it to the table, fearing that my touch would only make things
worse. I realized slowly that his (<font color='blue'><b>Edward</b></font>) words should frighten me. I waited for that fear to come, but all I could
seem to feel was an ache for his (<font color='blue'><b>Edward</b></font>) pain.
And frustration  frustration that Rosalie had interrupted whatever he (<font color='blue'><b>Edward</b></font>) was about to say. I didn't know

<p/>how to bring it up again. He (<font color='blue'><b>Edward</b></font>) still had his (<font color='blue'><b>Edward</b></font>) head in his (<font color='blue'><b>Edward</b></font>) hands.
I tried to speak in a normal voice. <div class="bookquote">``And you have to leave now?''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``Yes.''  (<font color='red'><b>He</b></font>)</div>He (<font color='blue'><b>Edward</b></font>) raised his (<font color='blue'><b>Edward</b></font>) face; it was serious for a moment, and then his (<font color='blue'><b>Edward</b></font>) mood shifted and he (<font color='blue'><b>Edward</b></font>) smiled. <div class="bookquote">``It's
probably for the best. We still have fifteen minutes of that wretched movie left to endure in Biology  I
don't think I could take any more.''
 (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div>I started. Alice  her (<font color='blue'><b>Alice</b></font>) short, inky hair in a halo of spiky disarray around her (<font color='blue'><b>Alice</b></font>) exquisite, elfin face  was
suddenly standing behind his (<font color='blue'><b>Edward</b></font>) shoulder. Her (<font color='blue'><b>Alice</b></font>) slight frame was willowy, graceful even in absolute stillness.
He (<font color='blue'><b>Edward</b></font>) greeted her (<font color='blue'><b>Alice</b></font>) without looking away from me. <div class="bookquote">``Alice.''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``Edward,''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Alice</b></font>) answered, her (<font color='blue'><b>Alice</b></font>) high soprano voice almost as attractive as his (<font color='blue'><b>Edward</b></font>).
<div class="bookquote">``Alice, Bella  Bella, Alice,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Edward</b></font>) introduced us, gesturing casually with his (<font color='blue'><b>Edward</b></font>) hand, a wry smile on his (<font color='blue'><b>Edward</b></font>) face.
<div class="bookquote">``Hello, Bella.''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>Her (<font color='blue'><b>Alice</b></font>) brilliant obsidian eyes were unreadable, but her (<font color='blue'><b>Alice</b></font>) smile was friendly. <div class="bookquote">``It's nice to finally
meet you.''
 (<font color='red'><b>Edward/Edward Cullen/Cullen</b></font>)</div>Edward flashed a dark look at her (<font color='blue'><b>Alice</b></font>).
<div class="bookquote">``Hi, Alice,''  (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div>I murmured shyly.
<div class="bookquote">``Are you ready?''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Alice</b></font>) asked him (<font color='blue'><b>Edward</b></font>).
His (<font color='blue'><b>Edward</b></font>) voice was aloof. <div class="bookquote">``Nearly. I'll meet you at the car.''
 (<font color='red'><b>She</b></font>)</div>She (<font color='blue'><b>Alice</b></font>) left without another word; her (<font color='blue'><b>Alice</b></font>) walk was so fluid, so sinuous that I felt a sharp pang of jealousy.
<div class="bookquote">``Should I say `have fun,''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>or is that the wrong sentiment?'' I asked, turning back to him (<font color='blue'><b>Edward</b></font>).
``No, `have fun' works as well as anything.'' He (<font color='blue'><b>Edward</b></font>) grinned.
``Have fun, then.'' I worked to sound wholehearted. Of course I didn't fool him (<font color='blue'><b>Edward</b></font>).
``I'll try.'' He (<font color='blue'><b>Edward</b></font>) still grinned. ``And you try to be safe, please.''
``Safe in Forks  what a challenge.''
``For you it is a challenge.'' His (<font color='blue'><b>Edward</b></font>) jaw hardened. ``Promise.''
``I promise to try to be safe,'' I recited. ``I'll do the laundry tonight  that ought to be fraught with peril.''
``Don't fall in,'' he (<font color='blue'><b>Edward</b></font>) mocked.
``I'll do my best.''
He (<font color='blue'><b>Edward</b></font>) stood then, and I rose, too.
``I'll see you tomorrow,'' I sighed.
``It seems like a long time to you, doesn't it?'' he (<font color='blue'><b>Edward</b></font>) mused.
I nodded glumly.
<div class="bookquote">``I'll be there in the morning,''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Edward</b></font>) promised, smiling his (<font color='blue'><b>Edward</b></font>) crooked smile. He (<font color='blue'><b>Edward</b></font>) reached across the table to

<p/>touch my face, lightly brushing along my cheekbone again. Then he (<font color='blue'><b>Edward</b></font>) turned and walked away. I stared
after him (<font color='blue'><b>Edward</b></font>) until he (<font color='blue'><b>Edward</b></font>) was gone.
I was sorely tempted to ditch the rest of the day, at the very least Gym, but a warning instinct stopped
me. I knew that if I disappeared now, Mike and others would assume I was with Edward. And Edward
was worried about the time we'd spent together publicly if things went wrong. I refused to dwell on the
last thought, concentrating instead on making things safer for him (<font color='blue'><b>Edward</b></font>).
I intuitively knew  and sensed he (<font color='blue'><b>Edward</b></font>) did, too  that tomorrow would be pivotal. Our relationship couldn't
continue to balance, as it did, on the point of a knife. We would fall off one edge or the other, depending
entirely upon his (<font color='blue'><b>Edward</b></font>) decision, or his (<font color='blue'><b>Edward</b></font>) instincts. My decision was made, made before I'd ever consciously
chosen, and I was committed to seeing it through. Because there was nothing more terrifying to me, more
excruciating, than the thought of turning away from him (<font color='blue'><b>Edward</b></font>). It was an impossibility.
I went to class, feeling dutiful. I couldn't honestly say what happened in Biology; my mind was too
preoccupied with thoughts of tomorrow. In Gym, Mike was speaking to me again; he (<font color='blue'><b>Mike</b></font>) wished me a good
time in Seattle. I carefully explained that I'd canceled my trip, worried about my truck.
<div class="bookquote">``Are you going to the dance with Cullen?''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Mike</b></font>) asked, suddenly sulky.
<div class="bookquote">``No, I'm not going to the dance at all.''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``What are you doing, then?''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Mike</b></font>) asked, too interested.
My natural urge was to tell him (<font color='blue'><b>Mike</b></font>) to butt out. Instead, I lied brightly.
<div class="bookquote">``Laundry, and then I have to study for the Trig test or I'm going to fail.''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``Is Cullen helping you study?''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``Edward,''  (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div>I emphasized, <div class="bookquote">``is not going to help me study. He (<font color='blue'><b>Edward</b></font>)'s gone away somewhere for the weekend.''
 (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div>The lies came more naturally than usual, I noted with surprise.
<div class="bookquote">``Oh.''  (<font color='red'><b>He</b></font>)</div>He (<font color='blue'><b>Mike</b></font>) perked up. <div class="bookquote">``You know, you could come to the dance with our group anyway  that would be
cool. We'd all dance with you,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Mike</b></font>) promised.
The mental image of Jessica's face made my tone sharper than necessary.
<div class="bookquote">``I'm not going to the dance, Mike, okay?''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``Fine.''  (<font color='red'><b>He</b></font>)</div>He (<font color='blue'><b>Mike</b></font>) sulked again. <div class="bookquote">``I was just offering.''
 (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div>When the school day had finally ended, I walked to the parking lot without enthusiasm. I did not
especially want to walk home, but I couldn't see how he (<font color='blue'><b>Mike</b></font>) would have retrieved my truck. Then again, I
was starting to believe that nothing was impossible for him (<font color='blue'><b>Mike</b></font>). The latter instinct proved correct  my truck
sat in the same space he (<font color='blue'><b>Mike</b></font>)'d parked his (<font color='blue'><b>Mike</b></font>) Volvo in this morning. I shook my head, incredulous, as I opened
the unlocked door and saw the key in the ignition.
There was a piece of white paper folded on my seat. I got in and closed the door before I unfolded it.
Two words were written in his (<font color='blue'><b>Mike</b></font>) elegant script.

<p/>Be safe.

<p/>The sound of the truck roaring to life frightened me. I laughed at myself.
When I got home, the handle of the door was locked, the dead bolt unlocked, just as I'd left it this
morning. Inside, I went straight to the laundry room. It looked just the same as I'd left it, too. I dug for
my jeans and, after finding them, checked the pockets. Empty. Maybe I'd hung my key up after all, I
thought, shaking my head.
Following the same instinct that had prompted me to lie to Mike, I called Jessica on the pretense of
wishing her (<font color='blue'><b>Jessica</b></font>) luck at the dance. When she (<font color='blue'><b>Jessica</b></font>) offered the same wish for my day with Edward, I told her (<font color='blue'><b>Jessica</b></font>) about
the cancellation. She (<font color='blue'><b>Jessica</b></font>) was more disappointed than really necessary for a third-party observer to be. I said
goodbye quickly after that.
Charlie was absentminded at dinner, worried over something at work, I guessed, or maybe a basketball
game, or maybe he (<font color='blue'><b>Charlie</b></font>) was just really enjoying the lasagna  it was hard to tell with Charlie.
<div class="bookquote">``You know, Dad''  (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div>I began, breaking into his (<font color='blue'><b>Charlie</b></font>) reverie.
<div class="bookquote">``What's that, Bell?''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``I think you're right about Seattle. I think I'll wait until Jessica or someone else can go with me.''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``Oh,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Charlie</b></font>) said, surprised. <div class="bookquote">``Oh, okay. So, do you want me to stay home?''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``No, Dad, don't change your plans. I've got a million things to do homework, laundry I need to go
to the library and the grocery store. I'll be in and out all day you go and have fun.''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``Are you sure?''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``Absolutely, Dad. Besides, the freezer is getting dangerously low on fish  we're down to a two, maybe
three years' supply.''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``You're sure easy to live with, Bella.''  (<font color='red'><b>He</b></font>)</div>He (<font color='blue'><b>Charlie</b></font>) smiled.
<div class="bookquote">``I could say the same thing about you,''  (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div>I said, laughing. The sound of my laughter was off, but he (<font color='blue'><b>Charlie</b></font>) didn't
seem to notice. I felt so guilty for deceiving him (<font color='blue'><b>Charlie</b></font>) that I almost took Edward's advice and told him (<font color='blue'><b>Edward</b></font>) where I
would be. Almost.
After dinner, I folded clothes and moved another load through the dryer. Unfortunately it was the kind of
job that only keeps hands busy. My mind definitely had too much free time, and it was getting out of
control. I fluctuated between anticipation so intense that it was very nearly pain, and an insidious fear that
picked at my resolve. I had to keep reminding myself that I'd made my choice, and I wasn't going back
on it. I pulled his (<font color='blue'><b>Edward</b></font>) note out of my pocket much more often than necessary to absorb the two small words
he (<font color='blue'><b>Edward</b></font>)'d written. He (<font color='blue'><b>Edward</b></font>) wants me to be safe, I told myself again and again. I would just hold on to the faith that,
in the end, that desire would win out over the others. And what was my other choice  to cut him (<font color='blue'><b>Edward</b></font>) out of
my life? Intolerable. Besides, since I'd come to Forks, it really seemed like my life was about him (<font color='blue'><b>Edward</b></font>).
But a tiny voice in the back of my mind worried, wondering if it would hurt very much if it ended
badly.
I was relieved when it was late enough to be acceptable for bedtime. I knew I was far too stressed to
sleep, so I did something I'd never done before. I deliberately took unnecessary cold medicine  the
kind that knocked me out for a good eight hours. I normally wouldn't condone that type of behavior in
myself, but tomorrow would be complicated enough without me being loopy from sleep deprivation on
top of everything else. While I waited for the drugs to kick in, I dried my clean hair till it was impeccably

<p/>straight, and fussed over what I would wear tomorrow. With everything ready for the morning, I finally
lay in my bed. I felt hyper; I couldn't stop twitching. I got up and rifled through my shoebox of CDs until I
found a collection of Chopin's nocturnes. I put that on very quietly and then lay down again,
concentrating on relaxing individual parts of my body. Somewhere in the middle of that exercise, the cold
pills took effect, and I gladly sank into unconsciousness.

<p/>I woke early, having slept soundly and dreamlessly thanks to my gratuitous drug use. Though I was well
rested, I slipped right back into the same hectic frenzy from the night before. I dressed in a rush,
smoothing my collar against my neck, fidgeting with the tan sweater till it hung right over my jeans. I
sneaked a swift look out the window to see that Charlie was already gone. A thin, cottony layer of
clouds veiled the sky. They didn't look very lasting.
I ate breakfast without tasting the food, hurrying to clean up when I was done. I peeked out the window
again, but nothing had changed. I had just finished brushing my teeth and was heading back downstairs
when a quiet knock sent my heart thudding against my rib cage.
I flew to the door; I had a little trouble with the simple dead bolt, but I yanked the door open at last, and
there he (<font color='blue'><b>I</b></font>) was. All the agitation dissolved as soon as I looked at his (<font color='blue'><b>I</b></font>) face, calm taking its place. I breathed
a sigh of relief  yesterday's fears seemed very foolish with him (<font color='blue'><b>I</b></font>) here.
He (<font color='blue'><b>I</b></font>) wasn't smiling at first  his (<font color='blue'><b>I</b></font>) face was somber. But then his (<font color='blue'><b>I</b></font>) expression lightened as he (<font color='blue'><b>I</b></font>) looked me
over, and he (<font color='blue'><b>I</b></font>) laughed.
<div class="bookquote">``Good morning,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>I</b></font>) chuckled.
<div class="bookquote">``What's wrong?''  (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div>I glanced down to make sure I hadn't forgotten anything important, like shoes, or pants.
<div class="bookquote">``We match.''  (<font color='red'><b>He</b></font>)</div>He (<font color='blue'><b>I</b></font>) laughed again. I realized he (<font color='blue'><b>I</b></font>) had a long, light tan sweater on, with a white collar showing
underneath, and blue jeans. I laughed with him (<font color='blue'><b>I</b></font>), hiding a secret twinge of regret  why did he (<font color='blue'><b>I</b></font>) have to
look like a runway model when I couldn't?
I locked the door behind me while he (<font color='blue'><b>I</b></font>) walked to the truck. He (<font color='blue'><b>I</b></font>) waited by the passenger door with a
martyred expression that was easy to understand.
<div class="bookquote">``We made a deal,''  (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div>I reminded him (<font color='blue'><b>I</b></font>) smugly, climbing into the driver's seat, and reaching over to unlock his (<font color='blue'><b>I</b></font>)
door.
<div class="bookquote">``Where to?''  (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div>I asked.
<div class="bookquote">``Put your seat belt on  I'm nervous already.''
 (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div>I gave him (<font color='blue'><b>I</b></font>) a dirty look as I complied.
<div class="bookquote">``Where to?''  (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div>I repeated with a sigh.
<div class="bookquote">``Take the one-oh-one north,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>I</b></font>) ordered.
It was surprisingly difficult to concentrate on the road while feeling his (<font color='blue'><b>I</b></font>) gaze on my face. I compensated
by driving more carefully than usual through the still-sleeping town.
<div class="bookquote">``Were you planning to make it out of Forks before nightfall?''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``This truck is old enough to be your car's grandfather  have some respect,''  (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div>I retorted.

<p/>We were soon out of the town limits, despite his (<font color='blue'><b>I</b></font>) negativity. Thick underbrush and green-swathed trunks
replaced the lawns and houses.
<div class="bookquote">``Turn right on the one-ten,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>I</b></font>) instructed just as I was about to ask. I obeyed silently.
<div class="bookquote">``Now we drive until the pavement ends.''
 (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div>I could hear a smile in his (<font color='blue'><b>I</b></font>) voice, but I was too afraid of driving off the road and proving him (<font color='blue'><b>I</b></font>) right to look
over and be sure.
<div class="bookquote">``And what's there, at the pavement's end?''  (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div>I wondered.
<div class="bookquote">``A trail.''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``We're hiking?''  (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div>Thank goodness I'd worn tennis shoes.
<div class="bookquote">``Is that a problem?''  (<font color='red'><b>He</b></font>)</div>He (<font color='blue'><b>I</b></font>) sounded as if he (<font color='blue'><b>I</b></font>)'d expected as much.
<div class="bookquote">``No.''  (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div>I tried to make the lie sound confident. But if he (<font color='blue'><b>I</b></font>) thought my truck was slow
<div class="bookquote">``Don't worry, it's only five miles or so, and we're in no hurry.''
 (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>Five miles. I didn't answer, so that he (<font color='blue'><b>I</b></font>) wouldn't hear my voice crack in panic. Five miles of treacherous
roots and loose stones, trying to twist my ankles or otherwise incapacitate me. This was going to be
humiliating.
We drove in silence for a while as I contemplated the coming horror.
<div class="bookquote">``What are you thinking?''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>I</b></font>) asked impatiently after a few moments.
I lied again. <div class="bookquote">``Just wondering where we're going.''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``It's a place I like to go when the weather is nice.''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>We both glanced out the windows at the thinning
clouds after he (<font color='blue'><b>I</b></font>) spoke.
<div class="bookquote">``Charlie said it would be warm today.''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``And did you tell Charlie what you were up to?''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>I</b></font>) asked.
<div class="bookquote">``Nope.''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``But Jessica thinks we're going to Seattle together?''  (<font color='red'><b>He</b></font>)</div>He (<font color='blue'><b>I</b></font>) seemed cheered by the idea.
<div class="bookquote">``No, I told her (<font color='blue'><b>Jessica</b></font>) you canceled on me  which is true.''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``No one knows you're with me?''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>Angrily, now.
<div class="bookquote">``That depends I assume you told Alice?''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``That's very helpful, Bella,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>I</b></font>) snapped.
I pretended I didn't hear that.
<div class="bookquote">``Are you so depressed by Forks that it's made you suicidal?''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>I</b></font>) demanded when I ignored him (<font color='blue'><b>I</b></font>).
<div class="bookquote">``You said it might cause trouble for you us being together publicly,''  (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div>I reminded him (<font color='blue'><b>I</b></font>).

<p/><div class="bookquote">``So you're worried about the trouble it might cause me if you don't come home?''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>His (<font color='blue'><b>I</b></font>) voice was still
angry, and bitingly sarcastic.
I nodded, keeping my eyes on the road.
He (<font color='blue'><b>I</b></font>) muttered something under his (<font color='blue'><b>I</b></font>) breath, speaking so quickly that I couldn't understand.
We were silent for the rest of the drive. I could feel the waves of infuriated disapproval rolling off of him (<font color='blue'><b>I</b></font>),
and I could think of nothing to say.
And then the road ended, constricting to a thin foot trail with a small wooden marker. I parked on the
narrow shoulder and stepped out, afraid because he (<font color='blue'><b>I</b></font>) was angry with me and I didn't have driving as an
excuse not to look at him (<font color='blue'><b>I</b></font>). It was warm now, warmer than it had been in Forks since the day I'd arrived,
almost muggy under the clouds. I pulled off my sweater and knotted it around my waist, glad that I'd
worn the light, sleeveless shirt  especially if I had five miles of hiking ahead of me.
I heard his (<font color='blue'><b>I</b></font>) door slam, and looked over to see that he (<font color='blue'><b>I</b></font>)'d removed his (<font color='blue'><b>I</b></font>) sweater, too. He (<font color='blue'><b>I</b></font>) was facing away
from me, into the unbroken forest beside my truck.
<div class="bookquote">``This way,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>I</b></font>) said, glancing over his (<font color='blue'><b>I</b></font>) shoulder at me, eyes still annoyed. He (<font color='blue'><b>I</b></font>) started into the dark forest.
<div class="bookquote">``The trail?''  (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div>Panic was clear in my voice as I hurried around the truck to catch up to him (<font color='blue'><b>I</b></font>).
<div class="bookquote">``I said there was a trail at the end of the road, not that we were taking it.''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``No trail?''  (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div>I asked desperately.
<div class="bookquote">``I won't let you get lost.''  (<font color='red'><b>He</b></font>)</div>He (<font color='blue'><b>I</b></font>) turned then, with a mocking smile, and I stifled a gasp. His (<font color='blue'><b>I</b></font>) white shirt was
sleeveless, and he (<font color='blue'><b>I</b></font>) wore it unbuttoned, so that the smooth white skin of his (<font color='blue'><b>I</b></font>) throat flowed uninterrupted
over the marble contours of his (<font color='blue'><b>I</b></font>) chest, his (<font color='blue'><b>I</b></font>) perfect musculature no longer merely hinted at behind
concealing clothes. He (<font color='blue'><b>I</b></font>) was too perfect, I realized with a piercing stab of despair. There was no way this
godlike creature could be meant for me.
He (<font color='blue'><b>I</b></font>) stared at me, bewildered by my tortured expression.
<div class="bookquote">``Do you want to go home?''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>I</b></font>) said quietly, a different pain than mine saturating his (<font color='blue'><b>I</b></font>) voice.
<div class="bookquote">``No.''  (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div>I walked forward till I was close beside him (<font color='blue'><b>I</b></font>), anxious not to waste one second of whatever time I
might have with him (<font color='blue'><b>I</b></font>).
<div class="bookquote">``What's wrong?''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>I</b></font>) asked, his (<font color='blue'><b>I</b></font>) voice gentle.
<div class="bookquote">``I'm not a good hiker,''  (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div>I answered dully. <div class="bookquote">``You'll have to be very patient.''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``I can be patient  if I make a great effort.''  (<font color='red'><b>He</b></font>)</div>He (<font color='blue'><b>I</b></font>) smiled, holding my glance, trying to lift me out of my
sudden, unexplained dejection.
I tried to smile back, but the smile was unconvincing. He (<font color='blue'><b>I</b></font>) scrutinized my face.
<div class="bookquote">``I'll take you home,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>I</b></font>) promised. I couldn't tell if the promise was unconditional, or restricted to an
immediate departure. I knew he (<font color='blue'><b>I</b></font>) thought it was fear that upset me, and I was grateful again that I was the
one person whose mind he (<font color='blue'><b>I</b></font>) couldn't hear.
<div class="bookquote">``If you want me to hack five miles through the jungle before sundown, you'd better start leading the way,''
 (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div>I said acidly. He (<font color='blue'><b>I</b></font>) frowned at me, struggling to understand my tone and expression.

<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>I</b></font>) gave up after a moment and led the way into the forest.
It wasn't as hard as I had feared. The way was mostly flat, and he (<font color='blue'><b>I</b></font>) held the damp ferns and webs of moss
aside for me. When his (<font color='blue'><b>I</b></font>) straight path took us over fallen trees or boulders, he (<font color='blue'><b>I</b></font>) would help me, lifting me by
the elbow, and then releasing me instantly when I was clear. His (<font color='blue'><b>I</b></font>) cold touch on my skin never failed to
make my heart thud erratically. Twice, when that happened, I caught a look on his (<font color='blue'><b>I</b></font>) face that made me
sure he (<font color='blue'><b>I</b></font>) could somehow hear it.
I tried to keep my eyes away from his (<font color='blue'><b>I</b></font>) perfection as much as possible, but I slipped often. Each time, his (<font color='blue'><b>I</b></font>)
beauty pierced me through with sadness.
For the most part, we walked in silence. Occasionally he (<font color='blue'><b>I</b></font>) would ask a random question that he (<font color='blue'><b>I</b></font>) hadn't
gotten to in the past two days of interrogation. He (<font color='blue'><b>I</b></font>) asked about my birthdays, my grade school teachers,
my childhood pets  and I had to admit that after killing three fish in a row, I'd given up on the whole
institution. He (<font color='blue'><b>I</b></font>) laughed at that, louder than I was used to  bell-like echoes bouncing back to us from the
empty woods.
The hike took me most of the morning, but he (<font color='blue'><b>I</b></font>) never showed any sign of impatience. The forest spread
out around us in a boundless labyrinth of ancient trees, and I began to be nervous that we would never
find our way out again. He (<font color='blue'><b>I</b></font>) was perfectly at ease, comfortable in the green maze, never seeming to feel
any doubt about our direction.
After several hours, the light that filtered through the canopy transformed, the murky olive tone shifting to
a brighter jade. The day had turned sunny, just as he (<font color='blue'><b>I</b></font>)'d foretold. For the first time since we'd entered the
woods, I felt a thrill of excitement  which quickly turned to impatience.
<div class="bookquote">``Are we there yet?''  (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div>I teased, pretending to scowl.
<div class="bookquote">``Nearly.''  (<font color='red'><b>He</b></font>)</div>He (<font color='blue'><b>I</b></font>) smiled at the change in my mood. <div class="bookquote">``Do you see the brightness ahead?''
 (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div>I peered into the thick forest. <div class="bookquote">``Um, should I?''
 (<font color='red'><b>He</b></font>)</div>He (<font color='blue'><b>I</b></font>) smirked. <div class="bookquote">``Maybe it's a bit soon for your eyes.''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``Time to visit the optometrist,''  (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div>I muttered. His (<font color='blue'><b>I</b></font>) smirk grew more pronounced.
But then, after another hundred yards, I could definitely see a lightening in the trees ahead, a glow that
was yellow instead of green. I picked up the pace, my eagerness growing with every step. He (<font color='blue'><b>I</b></font>) let me lead
now, following noiselessly.
I reached the edge of the pool of light and stepped through the last fringe of ferns into the loveliest place I
had ever seen. The meadow was small, perfectly round, and filled with wildflowers  violet, yellow, and
soft white. Somewhere nearby, I could hear the bubbling music of a stream. The sun was directly
overhead, filling the circle with a haze of buttery sunshine. I walked slowly, awestruck, through the soft
grass, swaying flowers, and warm, gilded air. I halfway turned, wanting to share this with him (<font color='blue'><b>I</b></font>), but he (<font color='blue'><b>I</b></font>)
wasn't behind me where I thought he (<font color='blue'><b>I</b></font>)'d be. I spun around, searching for him (<font color='blue'><b>I</b></font>) with sudden alarm. Finally I
spotted him (<font color='blue'><b>I</b></font>), still under the dense shade of the canopy at the edge of the hollow, watching me with
cautious eyes. Only then did I remember what the beauty of the meadow had driven from my mind 
the enigma of Edward and the sun, which he (<font color='blue'><b>Edward</b></font>)'d promised to illustrate for me today.
I took a step back toward him (<font color='blue'><b>Edward</b></font>), my eyes alight with curiosity. His (<font color='blue'><b>Edward</b></font>) eyes were wary, reluctant. I smiled
encouragingly and beckoned to him (<font color='blue'><b>Edward</b></font>) with my hand, taking another step back to him (<font color='blue'><b>Edward</b></font>). He (<font color='blue'><b>Edward</b></font>) held up a hand in
warning, and I hesitated, rocking back onto my heels.

<p/>Edward seemed to take a deep breath, and then he (<font color='blue'><b>Edward</b></font>) stepped out into the bright glow of the midday sun.

<p/>13. CONFESSIONS

<p/>Edward in the sunlight was shocking. I couldn't get used to it, though I'd been staring at him (<font color='blue'><b>Edward</b></font>) all afternoon.
His (<font color='blue'><b>Edward</b></font>) skin, white despite the faint flush from yesterday's hunting trip, literally sparkled, like thousands of tiny
diamonds were embedded in the surface. He (<font color='blue'><b>Edward</b></font>) lay perfectly still in the grass, his (<font color='blue'><b>Edward</b></font>) shirt open over his (<font color='blue'><b>Edward</b></font>)
sculpted, incandescent chest, his (<font color='blue'><b>Edward</b></font>) scintillating arms bare. His (<font color='blue'><b>Edward</b></font>) glistening, pale lavender lids were shut,
though of course he (<font color='blue'><b>Edward</b></font>) didn't sleep. A perfect statue, carved in some unknown stone, smooth like marble,
glittering like crystal.
Now and then, his (<font color='blue'><b>Edward</b></font>) lips would move, so fast it looked like they were trembling. But, when I asked, he (<font color='blue'><b>Edward</b></font>) told
me he (<font color='blue'><b>Edward</b></font>) was singing to himself; it was too low for me to hear.
I enjoyed the sun, too, though the air wasn't quite dry enough for my taste. I would have liked to lie back,
as he (<font color='blue'><b>Edward</b></font>) did, and let the sun warm my face. But I stayed curled up, my chin resting on my knees, unwilling to
take my eyes off him (<font color='blue'><b>Edward</b></font>). The wind was gentle; it tangled my hair and ruffled the grass that swayed around
his (<font color='blue'><b>Edward</b></font>) motionless form.
The meadow, so spectacular to me at first, paled next to his (<font color='blue'><b>Edward</b></font>) magnificence.
Hesitantly, always afraid, even now, that he (<font color='blue'><b>Edward</b></font>) would disappear like a mirage, too beautiful to be real
hesitantly, I reached out one finger and stroked the back of his (<font color='blue'><b>Edward</b></font>) shimmering hand, where it lay within my
reach. I marveled again at the perfect texture, satin smooth, cool as stone. When I looked up again, his (<font color='blue'><b>Edward</b></font>)
eyes were open, watching me. Butterscotch today, lighter, warmer after hunting. His (<font color='blue'><b>Edward</b></font>) quick smile turned
up the corners of his (<font color='blue'><b>Edward</b></font>) flawless lips.
<div class="bookquote">``I don't scare you?''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Edward</b></font>) asked playfully, but I could hear the real curiosity in his (<font color='blue'><b>Edward</b></font>) soft voice.
<div class="bookquote">``No more than usual.''
 (<font color='red'><b>He</b></font>)</div>He (<font color='blue'><b>Edward</b></font>) smiled wider; his (<font color='blue'><b>Edward</b></font>) teeth flashed in the sun.
I inched closer, stretched out my whole hand now to trace the contours of his (<font color='blue'><b>Edward</b></font>) forearm with my fingertips.
I saw that my fingers trembled, and knew it wouldn't escape his (<font color='blue'><b>Edward</b></font>) notice.
<div class="bookquote">``Do you mind?''  (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div>I asked, for he (<font color='blue'><b>Edward</b></font>) had closed his (<font color='blue'><b>Edward</b></font>) eyes again.
<div class="bookquote">``No,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Edward</b></font>) said without opening his (<font color='blue'><b>Edward</b></font>) eyes. <div class="bookquote">``You can't imagine how that feels.''  (<font color='red'><b>He</b></font>)</div>He (<font color='blue'><b>Edward</b></font>) sighed.
I lightly trailed my hand over the perfect muscles of his (<font color='blue'><b>Edward</b></font>) arm, followed the faint pattern of bluish veins
inside the crease at his (<font color='blue'><b>Edward</b></font>) elbow. With my other hand, I reached to turn his (<font color='blue'><b>Edward</b></font>) hand over. Realizing what I
wished, he (<font color='blue'><b>Edward</b></font>) flipped his (<font color='blue'><b>Edward</b></font>) palm up in one of those blindingly fast, disconcerting movements of his (<font color='blue'><b>Edward</b></font>). It startled
me; my fingers froze on his (<font color='blue'><b>Edward</b></font>) arm for a brief second.
<div class="bookquote">``Sorry,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Edward</b></font>) murmured. I looked up in time to see his (<font color='blue'><b>Edward</b></font>) golden eyes close again. <div class="bookquote">``It's too easy to be myself
with you.''
 (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div>I lifted his (<font color='blue'><b>Edward</b></font>) hand, turning it this way and that as I watched the sun glitter on his (<font color='blue'><b>Edward</b></font>) palm. I held it closer to my
face, trying to see the hidden facets in his (<font color='blue'><b>Edward</b></font>) skin.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Tell me what you're thinking,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Edward</b></font>) whispered. I looked to see his (<font color='blue'><b>Edward</b></font>) eyes watching me, suddenly intent. <div class="bookquote">``It's
still so strange for me, not knowing.''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``You know, the rest of us feel that way all the time.''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``It's a hard life.''  (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div>Did I imagine the hint of regret in his (<font color='blue'><b>Edward</b></font>) tone? <div class="bookquote">``But you didn't tell me.''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``I was wishing I could know what you were thinking''  (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div>I hesitated.
<div class="bookquote">``And?''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``I was wishing that I could believe that you were real. And I was wishing that I wasn't afraid.''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``I don't want you to be afraid.''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>His (<font color='blue'><b>Edward</b></font>) voice was just a soft murmur. I heard what he (<font color='blue'><b>Edward</b></font>) couldn't truthfully say,
that I didn't need to be afraid, that there was nothing to fear.
<div class="bookquote">``Well, that's not exactly the fear I meant, though that's certainly something to think about.''
 (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div>So quickly that I missed his (<font color='blue'><b>Edward</b></font>) movement, he (<font color='blue'><b>Edward</b></font>) was half sitting, propped up on his (<font color='blue'><b>Edward</b></font>) right arm, his (<font color='blue'><b>Edward</b></font>) left palm still
in my hands. His (<font color='blue'><b>Edward</b></font>) angel's face was only a few inches from mine. I might have  should have  flinched
away from his (<font color='blue'><b>Edward</b></font>) unexpected closeness, but I was unable to move. His (<font color='blue'><b>Edward</b></font>) golden eyes mesmerized me.
<div class="bookquote">``What are you afraid of, then?''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Edward</b></font>) whispered intently.
But I couldn't answer. As I had just that once before, I smelled his (<font color='blue'><b>Edward</b></font>) cool breath in my face. Sweet,
delicious, the scent made my mouth water. It was unlike anything else. Instinctively, unthinkingly, I leaned
closer, inhaling.
And he (<font color='blue'><b>Edward</b></font>) was gone, his (<font color='blue'><b>Edward</b></font>) hand ripped from mine. In the time it took my eyes to focus, he (<font color='blue'><b>Edward</b></font>) was twenty feet
away, standing at the edge of the small meadow, in the deep shade of a huge fir tree. He (<font color='blue'><b>Edward</b></font>) stared at me, his (<font color='blue'><b>Edward</b></font>)
eyes dark in the shadows, his (<font color='blue'><b>Edward</b></font>) expression unreadable.
I could feel the hurt and shock on my face. My empty hands stung.
<div class="bookquote">``I'm sorry Edward,''  (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div>I whispered. I knew he (<font color='blue'><b>Edward</b></font>) could hear.
<div class="bookquote">``Give me a moment,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Edward</b></font>) called, just loud enough for my less sensitive ears. I sat very still.
After ten incredibly long seconds, he (<font color='blue'><b>Edward</b></font>) walked back, slowly for him (<font color='blue'><b>Edward</b></font>). He (<font color='blue'><b>Edward</b></font>) stopped, still several feet away,
and sank gracefully to the ground, crossing his (<font color='blue'><b>Edward</b></font>) legs. His (<font color='blue'><b>Edward</b></font>) eyes never left mine. He (<font color='blue'><b>Edward</b></font>) took two deep breaths,
and then smiled in apology.
<div class="bookquote">``I am so very sorry.''  (<font color='red'><b>He</b></font>)</div>He (<font color='blue'><b>Edward</b></font>) hesitated. <div class="bookquote">``Would you understand what I meant if I said I was only human?''
 (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div>I nodded once, not quite able to smile at his (<font color='blue'><b>Edward</b></font>) joke. Adrenaline pulsed through my veins as the realization
of danger slowly sank in. He (<font color='blue'><b>Edward</b></font>) could smell that from where he (<font color='blue'><b>Edward</b></font>) sat. His (<font color='blue'><b>Edward</b></font>) smile turned mocking.
<div class="bookquote">``I'm the world's best predator, aren't I? Everything about me invites you in  my voice, my face, even
my smell. As if I need any of that!''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>Unexpectedly, he (<font color='blue'><b>Edward</b></font>) was on his (<font color='blue'><b>Edward</b></font>) feet, bounding away, instantly out of
sight, only to appear beneath the same tree as before, having circled the meadow in half a second.
<div class="bookquote">``As if you could outrun me,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Edward</b></font>) laughed bitterly.
He (<font color='blue'><b>Edward</b></font>) reached up with one hand and, with a deafening crack, effortlessly ripped a two-foot-thick branch
from the trunk of the spruce. He (<font color='blue'><b>Edward</b></font>) balanced it in that hand for a moment, and then threw it with blinding

<p/>speed, shattering it against another huge tree, which shook and trembled at the blow.
And he (<font color='blue'><b>Edward</b></font>) was in front of me again, standing two feet away, still as a stone.
<div class="bookquote">``As if you could fight me off,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Edward</b></font>) said gently.
I sat without moving, more frightened of him (<font color='blue'><b>Edward</b></font>) than I had ever been. I'd never seen him (<font color='blue'><b>Edward</b></font>) so completely freed
of that carefully cultivated facade. He (<font color='blue'><b>Edward</b></font>)'d never been less human or more beautiful. Face ashen, eyes
wide, I sat like a bird locked in the eyes of a snake.
His (<font color='blue'><b>Edward</b></font>) lovely eyes seem to glow with rash excitement. Then, as the seconds passed, they dimmed. His (<font color='blue'><b>Edward</b></font>)
expression slowly folded into a mask of ancient sadness.
<div class="bookquote">``Don't be afraid,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Edward</b></font>) murmured, his (<font color='blue'><b>Edward</b></font>) velvet voice unintentionally seductive. <div class="bookquote">``I promise''  (<font color='red'><b>He</b></font>)</div>He (<font color='blue'><b>Edward</b></font>) hesitated. <div class="bookquote">``I
swear not to hurt you.''  (<font color='red'><b>He</b></font>)</div>He (<font color='blue'><b>Edward</b></font>) seemed more concerned with convincing himself than me.
<div class="bookquote">``Don't be afraid,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Edward</b></font>) whispered again as he (<font color='blue'><b>Edward</b></font>) stepped closer, with exaggerated slowness. He (<font color='blue'><b>Edward</b></font>) sat sinuously,
with deliberately unhurried movements, till our faces were on the same level, just a foot apart.
<div class="bookquote">``Please forgive me,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Edward</b></font>) said formally. <div class="bookquote">``I can control myself. You caught me off guard. But I'm on my best
behavior now.''
 (<font color='red'><b>He</b></font>)</div>He (<font color='blue'><b>Edward</b></font>) waited, but I still couldn't speak.
<div class="bookquote">``I'm not thirsty today, honestly.''  (<font color='red'><b>He</b></font>)</div>He (<font color='blue'><b>Edward</b></font>) winked.
At that I had to laugh, though the sound was shaky and breathless.
<div class="bookquote">``Are you all right?''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Edward</b></font>) asked tenderly, reaching out slowly, carefully, to place his (<font color='blue'><b>Edward</b></font>) marble hand back in
mine.
I looked at his (<font color='blue'><b>Edward</b></font>) smooth, cold hand, and then at his (<font color='blue'><b>him</b></font>) eyes. They were soft, repentant. I looked back at his (<font color='blue'><b>His</b></font>)
hand, and then deliberately returned to tracing the lines in his (<font color='blue'><b>He</b></font>) hand with my fingertip. I looked up and
smiled timidly.
His (<font color='blue'><b>his</b></font>) answering smile was dazzling.
<div class="bookquote">``So where were we, before I behaved so rudely?''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>his</b></font>) asked in the gentle cadences of an earlier century.
<div class="bookquote">``I honestly can't remember.''
 (<font color='red'><b>He</b></font>)</div>He (<font color='blue'><b>his</b></font>) smiled, but his (<font color='blue'><b>His</b></font>) face was ashamed. <div class="bookquote">``I think we were talking about why you were afraid, besides the
obvious reason.''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``Oh, right.''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``Well?''
 (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div>I looked down at his (<font color='blue'><b>His</b></font>) hand and doodled aimlessly across his (<font color='blue'><b>he</b></font>) smooth, iridescent palm. The seconds ticked
by.
<div class="bookquote">``How easily frustrated I am,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>his</b></font>) sighed. I looked into his (<font color='blue'><b>he</b></font>) eyes, abruptly grasping that this was every bit as
new to him (<font color='blue'><b>he</b></font>) as it was to me. As many years of unfathomable experience as he (<font color='blue'><b>he</b></font>) had, this was hard for him (<font color='blue'><b>him</b></font>),
too. I took courage from that thought.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``I was afraid because, for, well, obvious reasons, I can't stay with you. And I'm afraid that I'd like to
stay with you, much more than I should.''  (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div>I looked down at his (<font color='blue'><b>his</b></font>) hands as I spoke. It was difficult for me to
say this aloud.
<div class="bookquote">``Yes,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>his</b></font>) agreed slowly. <div class="bookquote">``That is something to be afraid of, indeed. Wanting to be with me. That's really
not in your best interest.''
 (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div>I frowned.
<div class="bookquote">``I should have left long ago,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>he</b></font>) sighed. <div class="bookquote">``I should leave now. But I don't know if I can.''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``I don't want you to leave,''  (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div>I mumbled pathetically, staring down again.
<div class="bookquote">``Which is exactly why I should. But don't worry. I'm essentially a selfish creature. I crave your company
too much to do what I should.''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``I'm glad.''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``Don't be!''  (<font color='red'><b>He</b></font>)</div>He (<font color='blue'><b>his</b></font>) withdrew his (<font color='blue'><b>his</b></font>) hand, more gently this time; his (<font color='blue'><b>His</b></font>) voice was harsher than usual. Harsh for him (<font color='blue'><b>his</b></font>),
still more beautiful than any human voice. It was hard to keep up  his (<font color='blue'><b>he</b></font>) sudden mood changes left me
always a step behind, dazed.
<div class="bookquote">``It's not only your company I crave! Never forget that. Never forget I am more dangerous to you than I
am to anyone else.''  (<font color='red'><b>He</b></font>)</div>He (<font color='blue'><b>his</b></font>) stopped, and I looked to see him (<font color='blue'><b>He</b></font>) gazing unseeingly into the forest.
I thought for a moment.
<div class="bookquote">``I don't think I understand exactly what you mean  by that last part anyway,''  (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div>I said.
He (<font color='blue'><b>his</b></font>) looked back at me and smiled, his (<font color='blue'><b>his</b></font>) mood shifting yet again.
<div class="bookquote">``How do I explain?''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>his</b></font>) mused. <div class="bookquote">``And without frightening you again hmmmm.''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>Without seeming to think
about it, he (<font color='blue'><b>he</b></font>) placed his (<font color='blue'><b>his</b></font>) hand back in mine; I held it tightly in both of mine. He (<font color='blue'><b>he</b></font>) looked at our hands.
<div class="bookquote">``That's amazingly pleasant, the warmth.''  (<font color='red'><b>He</b></font>)</div>He (<font color='blue'><b>his</b></font>) sighed.
A moment passed as he (<font color='blue'><b>He</b></font>) assembled his (<font color='blue'><b>his</b></font>) thoughts.
<div class="bookquote">``You know how everyone enjoys different flavors?''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>his</b></font>) began. <div class="bookquote">``Some people love chocolate ice cream,
others prefer strawberry?''
 (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div>I nodded.
<div class="bookquote">``Sorry about the food analogy  I couldn't think of another way to explain.''
 (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div>I smiled. He (<font color='blue'><b>his</b></font>) smiled ruefully back.
<div class="bookquote">``You see, every person smells different, has a different essence. If you locked an alcoholic in a room full
of stale beer, he (<font color='blue'><b>you</b></font>)'d gladly drink it. But he (<font color='blue'><b>you</b></font>) could resist, if he (<font color='blue'><b>you</b></font>) wished to, if he (<font color='blue'><b>you</b></font>) were a recovering alcoholic.
Now let's say you placed in that room a glass of hundred-year-old brandy, the rarest, finest cognac 
and filled the room with its warm aroma  how do you think he (<font color='blue'><b>you</b></font>) would fare then?''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>We sat silently, looking into each other's eyes  trying to read each other's thoughts.
He (<font color='blue'><b>he</b></font>) broke the silence first.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Maybe that's not the right comparison. Maybe it would be too easy to turn down the brandy. Perhaps I
should have made our alcoholic a heroin addict instead.''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``So what you're saying is, I'm your brand of heroin?''  (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div>I teased, trying to lighten the mood.
He (<font color='blue'><b>his</b></font>) smiled swiftly, seeming to appreciate my effort. <div class="bookquote">``Yes, you are exactly my brand of heroin.''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``Does that happen often?''  (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div>I asked.
He (<font color='blue'><b>his</b></font>) looked across the treetops, thinking through his (<font color='blue'><b>his</b></font>) response.
<div class="bookquote">``I spoke to my brothers about it.''  (<font color='red'><b>He</b></font>)</div>He (<font color='blue'><b>he</b></font>) still stared into the distance. <div class="bookquote">``To Jasper, every one of you is much
the same. He (<font color='blue'><b>Jasper</b></font>)'s the most recent to join our family. It's a struggle for him (<font color='blue'><b>Jasper</b></font>) to abstain at all. He (<font color='blue'><b>Jasper</b></font>) hasn't had
time to grow sensitive to the differences in smell, in flavor.''  (<font color='red'><b>He</b></font>)</div>He (<font color='blue'><b>his</b></font>) glanced swiftly at me, his (<font color='blue'><b>his</b></font>) expression
apologetic.
<div class="bookquote">``Sorry,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>his</b></font>) said.
<div class="bookquote">``I don't mind. Please don't worry about offending me, or frightening me, or whichever. That's the way
you think. I can understand, or I can try to at least. Just explain however you can.''
 (<font color='red'><b>He</b></font>)</div>He (<font color='blue'><b>his</b></font>) took a deep breath and gazed at the sky again.
<div class="bookquote">``So Jasper wasn't sure if he (<font color='blue'><b>Jasper</b></font>)'d ever come across someone who was as''   (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>he</b></font>) hesitated, looking for the
right word  <div class="bookquote">``appealing as you are to me. Which makes me think not. Emmett has been on the wagon
longer, so to speak, and he (<font color='blue'><b>Emmett</b></font>) understood what I meant. He (<font color='blue'><b>Emmett</b></font>) says twice, for him (<font color='blue'><b>Emmett</b></font>), once stronger than the
other.''
 (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``And for you?''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``Never.''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>The word hung there for a moment in the warm breeze.
<div class="bookquote">``What did Emmett do?''  (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div>I asked to break the silence.
It was the wrong question to ask. His (<font color='blue'><b>his</b></font>) face grew dark, his (<font color='blue'><b>his</b></font>) hand clenched into a fist inside mine. He (<font color='blue'><b>His</b></font>)
looked away. I waited, but he (<font color='blue'><b>he</b></font>) wasn't going to answer.
<div class="bookquote">``I guess I know,''  (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div>I finally said.
He (<font color='blue'><b>his</b></font>) lifted his (<font color='blue'><b>he</b></font>) eyes; his (<font color='blue'><b>his</b></font>) expression was wistful, pleading.
<div class="bookquote">``Even the strongest of us fall off the wagon, don't we?''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``What are you asking? My permission?''  (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div>My voice was sharper than I'd intended. I tried to make my
tone kinder  I could guess what his (<font color='blue'><b>his</b></font>) honesty must cost him (<font color='blue'><b>His</b></font>). <div class="bookquote">``I mean, is there no hope, then?''  (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div>How
calmly I could discuss my own death!
<div class="bookquote">``No, no!''  (<font color='red'><b>He</b></font>)</div>He (<font color='blue'><b>His</b></font>) was instantly contrite. <div class="bookquote">``Of course there's hope! I mean, of course I won't''  (<font color='red'><b>He</b></font>)</div>He (<font color='blue'><b>his</b></font>) left the
sentence hanging. His (<font color='blue'><b>His</b></font>) eyes burned into mine. <div class="bookquote">``It's different for us. Emmett these were strangers he (<font color='blue'><b>Emmett</b></font>)
happened across. It was a long time ago, and he (<font color='blue'><b>Emmett</b></font>) wasn't as practiced, as careful, as he (<font color='blue'><b>Emmett</b></font>) is now.''
 (<font color='red'><b>He</b></font>)</div>He (<font color='blue'><b>he</b></font>) fell silent and watched me intently as I thought it through.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``So if we'd met oh, in a dark alley or something''  (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div>I trailed off.
<div class="bookquote">``It took everything I had not to jump up in the middle of that class full of children and ''  (<font color='red'><b>He</b></font>)</div>He (<font color='blue'><b>his</b></font>) stopped
abruptly, looking away. <div class="bookquote">``When you walked past me, I could have ruined everything Carlisle has built for
us, right then and there. If I hadn't been denying my thirst for the last, well, too many years, I wouldn't
have been able to stop myself.''  (<font color='red'><b>He</b></font>)</div>He (<font color='blue'><b>he</b></font>) paused, scowling at the trees.
He (<font color='blue'><b>his</b></font>) glanced at me grimly, both of us remembering. <div class="bookquote">``You must have thought I was possessed.''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``I couldn't understand why. How you could hate me so quickly''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``To me, it was like you were some kind of demon, summoned straight from my own personal hell to ruin
me. The fragrance coming off your skin I thought it would make me deranged that first day. In that one
hour, I thought of a hundred different ways to lure you from the room with me, to get you alone. And I
fought them each back, thinking of my family, what I could do to them. I had to run out, to get away
before I could speak the words that would make you follow''
 (<font color='red'><b>He</b></font>)</div>He (<font color='blue'><b>he</b></font>) looked up then at my staggered expression as I tried to absorb his (<font color='blue'><b>He</b></font>) bitter memories. His (<font color='blue'><b>his</b></font>) golden eyes
scorched from under his (<font color='blue'><b>his</b></font>) lashes, hypnotic and deadly.
<div class="bookquote">``You would have come,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>he</b></font>) promised.
I tried to speak calmly. <div class="bookquote">``Without a doubt.''
 (<font color='red'><b>He</b></font>)</div>He (<font color='blue'><b>he</b></font>) frowned down at my hands, releasing me from the force of his (<font color='blue'><b>he</b></font>) stare. <div class="bookquote">``And then, as I tried to
rearrange my schedule in a pointless attempt to avoid you, you were there  in that close, warm little
room, the scent was maddening. I so very nearly took you then. There was only one other frail human
there  so easily dealt with.''
 (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div>I shivered in the warm sun, seeing my memories anew through his (<font color='blue'><b>him</b></font>) eyes, only now grasping the danger.
Poor Ms. Cope; I shivered again at how close I'd come to being inadvertently responsible for her (<font color='blue'><b>Cope</b></font>) death.
<div class="bookquote">``But I resisted. I don't know how. I forced myself not to wait for you, not to follow you from the school.
It was easier outside, when I couldn't smell you anymore, to think clearly, to make the right decision. I
left the others near home  I was too ashamed to tell them how weak I was, they only knew something
was very wrong  and then I went straight to Carlisle, at the hospital, to tell him (<font color='blue'><b>I</b></font>) I was leaving.''
 (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div>I stared in surprise.
``I traded cars with him (<font color='blue'><b>I</b></font>)  he (<font color='blue'><b>I</b></font>) had a full tank of gas and I didn't want to stop. I didn't dare to go home, to
face Esme. She (<font color='blue'><b>I</b></font>) wouldn't have let me go without a scene. She (<font color='blue'><b>I</b></font>) would have tried to convince me that it
wasn't necessary
``By the next morning I was in Alaska.'' He (<font color='blue'><b>He</b></font>) sounded ashamed, as if admitting a great cowardice. ``I spent
two days there, with some old acquaintances but I was homesick. I hated knowing I'd upset Esme,
and the rest of them, my adopted family. In the pure air of the mountains it was hard to believe you were
so irresistible. I convinced myself it was weak to run away. I'd dealt with temptation before, not of this
magnitude, not even close, but I was strong. Who were you, an insignificant little girl''  he (<font color='blue'><b>his</b></font>) grinned
suddenly  ``to chase me from the place I wanted to be? So I came back'' He (<font color='blue'><b>His</b></font>) stared off into space.
I couldn't speak.
``I took precautions, hunting, feeding more than usual before seeing you again. I was sure that I was
strong enough to treat you like any other human. I was arrogant about it.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``It was unquestionably a complication that I couldn't simply read your thoughts to know what your
reaction was to me. I wasn't used to having to go to such circuitous measures, listening to your words in
Jessica's mind her (<font color='blue'><b>Jessica</b></font>) mind isn't very original, and it was annoying to have to stoop to that. And then I
couldn't know if you really meant what you said. It was all extremely irritating.''  (<font color='red'><b>He</b></font>)</div>He (<font color='blue'><b>He</b></font>) frowned at the
memory.
``I wanted you to forget my behavior that first day, if possible, so I tried to talk with you like I would with
any person. I was eager actually, hoping to decipher some of your thoughts. But you were too interesting,
I found myself caught up in your expressions and every now and then you would stir the air with your
hand or your hair, and the scent would stun me again
``Of course, then you were nearly crushed to death in front of my eyes. Later I thought of a perfectly
good excuse for why I acted at that moment  because if I hadn't saved you, if your blood had been
spilled there in front of me, I don't think I could have stopped myself from exposing us for what we are.
But I only thought of that excuse later. At the time, all I could think was, <div class="bookquote">``Not her (<font color='blue'><b>me</b></font>).'''
 (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div>He (<font color='blue'><b>He</b></font>) closed his (<font color='blue'><b>his</b></font>) eyes, lost in his (<font color='blue'><b>He</b></font>) agonized confession. I listened, more eager than rational. Common sense
told me I should be terrified. Instead, I was relieved to finally understand. And I was filled with
compassion for his (<font color='blue'><b>he</b></font>) suffering, even now, as he (<font color='blue'><b>His</b></font>) confessed his (<font color='blue'><b>he</b></font>) craving to take my life.
I finally was able to speak, though my voice was faint. <div class="bookquote">``In the hospital?''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>His (<font color='blue'><b>his</b></font>) eyes flashed up to mine. <div class="bookquote">``I was appalled. I couldn't believe I had put us in danger after all, put myself
in your power  you of all people. As if I needed another motive to kill you.''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>We both flinched as that
word slipped out. <div class="bookquote">``But it had the opposite effect,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>he</b></font>) continued quickly. <div class="bookquote">``I fought with Rosalie, Emmett,
and Jasper when they suggested that now was the time the worst fight we've ever had. Carlisle sided
with me, and Alice.''  (<font color='red'><b>He</b></font>)</div>He (<font color='blue'><b>He</b></font>) grimaced when he (<font color='blue'><b>He</b></font>) said her (<font color='blue'><b>me</b></font>) name. I couldn't imagine why. <div class="bookquote">``Esme told me to do
whatever I had to in order to stay.''  (<font color='red'><b>He</b></font>)</div>He (<font color='blue'><b>he</b></font>) shook his (<font color='blue'><b>he</b></font>) head indulgently.
<div class="bookquote">``All that next day I eavesdropped on the minds of everyone you spoke to, shocked that you kept your
word. I didn't understand you at all. But I knew that I couldn't become more involved with you. I did my
very best to stay as far from you as possible. And every day the perfume of your skin, your breath, your
hair it hit me as hard as the very first day.''
 (<font color='red'><b>He</b></font>)</div>He (<font color='blue'><b>him</b></font>) met my eyes again, and they were surprisingly tender.
<div class="bookquote">``And for all that,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>him</b></font>) continued, <div class="bookquote">``I'd have fared better if I had exposed us all at that first moment, than if
now, here  with no witnesses and nothing to stop me  I were to hurt you.''
 (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>I was human enough to have to ask. <div class="bookquote">``Why?''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``Isabella.''  (<font color='red'><b>He</b></font>)</div>He (<font color='blue'><b>He</b></font>) pronounced my full name carefully, then playfully ruffled my hair with his (<font color='blue'><b>His</b></font>) free hand. A
shock ran through my body at his (<font color='blue'><b>His</b></font>) casual touch. <div class="bookquote">``Bella, I couldn't live with myself if I ever hurt you. You
don't know how it's tortured me.''  (<font color='red'><b>He</b></font>)</div>He (<font color='blue'><b>he</b></font>) looked down, ashamed again. <div class="bookquote">``The thought of you, still, white,
cold to never see you blush scarlet again, to never see that flash of intuition in your eyes when you see
through my pretenses it would be unendurable.''  (<font color='red'><b>He</b></font>)</div>He (<font color='blue'><b>his</b></font>) lifted his (<font color='blue'><b>He</b></font>) glorious, agonized eyes to mine. <div class="bookquote">``You are
the most important thing to me now. The most important thing to me ever.''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>My head was spinning at the rapid change in direction our conversation had taken. From the cheerful
topic of my impending demise, we were suddenly declaring ourselves. He (<font color='blue'><b>He</b></font>) waited, and even though I
looked down to study our hands between us, I knew his (<font color='blue'><b>he</b></font>) golden eyes were on me. <div class="bookquote">``You already know
how I feel, of course,''  (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div>I finally said. <div class="bookquote">``I'm here which, roughly translated, means I would rather die than
stay away from you.''  (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div>I frowned. <div class="bookquote">``I'm an idiot.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``You are an idiot,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>he</b></font>) agreed with a laugh. Our eyes met, and I laughed, too. We laughed together at the
idiocy and sheer impossibility of such a moment.
<div class="bookquote">``And so the lion fell in love with the lamb''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>He</b></font>) murmured. I looked away, hiding my eyes as I thrilled to
the word.
<div class="bookquote">``What a stupid lamb,''  (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div>I sighed.
<div class="bookquote">``What a sick, masochistic lion.''  (<font color='red'><b>He</b></font>)</div>He (<font color='blue'><b>he</b></font>) stared into the shadowy forest for a long moment, and I wondered
where his (<font color='blue'><b>He</b></font>) thoughts had taken him (<font color='blue'><b>He</b></font>).
<div class="bookquote">``Why ?''  (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div>I began, and then paused, not sure how to continue.
He (<font color='blue'><b>He</b></font>) looked at me and smiled; sunlight glinted off his (<font color='blue'><b>he</b></font>) face, his (<font color='blue'><b>his</b></font>) teeth.
<div class="bookquote">``Yes?''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``Tell me why you ran from me before.''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>His (<font color='blue'><b>his</b></font>) smile faded. <div class="bookquote">``You know why.''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``No, I mean, exactly what did I do wrong? I'll have to be on my guard, you see, so I better start learning
what I shouldn't do. This, for example''   (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div>I stroked the back of his (<font color='blue'><b>his</b></font>) hand  <div class="bookquote">``seems to be all right.''
 (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div>He (<font color='blue'><b>his</b></font>) smiled again. <div class="bookquote">``You didn't do anything wrong, Bella. It was my fault.''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``But I want to help, if I can, to not make this harder for you.''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``Well''  (<font color='red'><b>He</b></font>)</div>He (<font color='blue'><b>his</b></font>) contemplated for a moment. <div class="bookquote">``It was just how close you were. Most humans instinctively shy
away from us, are repelled by our alienness I wasn't expecting you to come so close. And the smell of
your throat.''  (<font color='red'><b>He</b></font>)</div>He (<font color='blue'><b>His</b></font>) stopped short, looking to see if he (<font color='blue'><b>he</b></font>)'d upset me.
<div class="bookquote">``Okay, then,''  (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div>I said flippantly, trying to alleviate the suddenly tense atmosphere. I tucked my chin. <div class="bookquote">``No
throat exposure.''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>It worked; he (<font color='blue'><b>He</b></font>) laughed. <div class="bookquote">``No, really, it was more the surprise than anything else.''
 (<font color='red'><b>He</b></font>)</div>He (<font color='blue'><b>his</b></font>) raised his (<font color='blue'><b>his</b></font>) free hand and placed it gently on the side of my neck. I sat very still, the chill of his (<font color='blue'><b>he</b></font>) touch a
natural warning  a warning telling me to be terrified. But there was no feeling of fear in me. There were,
however, other feelings
<div class="bookquote">``You see,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>his</b></font>) said. <div class="bookquote">``Perfectly fine.''
 (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div>My blood was racing, and I wished I could slow it, sensing that this must make everything so much more
difficult  the thudding of my pulse in my veins. Surely he (<font color='blue'><b>him</b></font>) could hear it.
<div class="bookquote">``The blush on your cheeks is lovely,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>he</b></font>) murmured. He (<font color='blue'><b>him</b></font>) gently freed his (<font color='blue'><b>his</b></font>) other hand. My hands fell limply
into my lap. Softly he (<font color='blue'><b>he</b></font>) brushed my cheek, then held my face between his (<font color='blue'><b>he</b></font>) marble hands.
<div class="bookquote">``Be very still,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>He</b></font>) whispered, as if I wasn't already frozen.
Slowly, never moving his (<font color='blue'><b>his</b></font>) eyes from mine, he (<font color='blue'><b>his</b></font>) leaned toward me. Then abruptly, but very gently, he (<font color='blue'><b>him</b></font>) rested
his (<font color='blue'><b>his</b></font>) cold cheek against the hollow at the base of my throat. I was quite unable to move, even if I'd wanted
to. I listened to the sound of his (<font color='blue'><b>He</b></font>) even breathing, watching the sun and wind play in his (<font color='blue'><b>him</b></font>) bronze hair, more
human than any other part of him (<font color='blue'><b>He</b></font>).

<p/>With deliberate slowness, his (<font color='blue'><b>his</b></font>) hands slid down the sides of my neck. I shivered, and I heard him (<font color='blue'><b>he</b></font>) catch his (<font color='blue'><b>he</b></font>)
breath. But his (<font color='blue'><b>his</b></font>) hands didn't pause as they softly moved to my shoulders, and then stopped.
His (<font color='blue'><b>He</b></font>) face drifted to the side, his (<font color='blue'><b>He</b></font>) nose skimming across my collarbone. He (<font color='blue'><b>he</b></font>) came to rest with the side of his (<font color='blue'><b>his</b></font>)
face pressed tenderly against my chest.
Listening to my heart.
<div class="bookquote">``Ah,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>he</b></font>) sighed.
I don't know how long we sat without moving. It could have been hours. Eventually the throb of my pulse
quieted, but he (<font color='blue'><b>He</b></font>) didn't move or speak again as he (<font color='blue'><b>He</b></font>) held me. I knew at any moment it could be too much,
and my life could end  so quickly that I might not even notice. And I couldn't make myself be afraid. I
couldn't think of anything, except that he (<font color='blue'><b>He</b></font>) was touching me.
And then, too soon, he (<font color='blue'><b>He</b></font>) released me.
His (<font color='blue'><b>his</b></font>) eyes were peaceful.
<div class="bookquote">``It won't be so hard again,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>He</b></font>) said with satisfaction.
<div class="bookquote">``Was that very hard for you?''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``Not nearly as bad as I imagined it would be. And you?''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``No, it wasn't bad for me.''
 (<font color='red'><b>He</b></font>)</div>He (<font color='blue'><b>He</b></font>) smiled at my inflection. <div class="bookquote">``You know what I mean.''
 (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div>I smiled.
<div class="bookquote">``Here.''  (<font color='red'><b>He</b></font>)</div>He (<font color='blue'><b>his</b></font>) took my hand and placed it against his (<font color='blue'><b>he</b></font>) cheek. <div class="bookquote">``Do you feel how warm it is?''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>And it was almost warm, his (<font color='blue'><b>He</b></font>) usually icy skin. But I barely noticed, for I was touching his (<font color='blue'><b>he</b></font>) face, something
I'd dreamed of constantly since the first day I'd seen him (<font color='blue'><b>His</b></font>).
<div class="bookquote">``Don't move,''  (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div>I whispered.
No one could be still like Edward. He (<font color='blue'><b>Edward</b></font>) closed his (<font color='blue'><b>Edward</b></font>) eyes and became as immobile as stone, a carving under
my hand.
I moved even more slowly than he (<font color='blue'><b>Edward</b></font>) had, careful not to make one unexpected move. I caressed his (<font color='blue'><b>Edward</b></font>) cheek,
delicately stroked his (<font color='blue'><b>Edward</b></font>) eyelid, the purple shadow in the hollow under his (<font color='blue'><b>Edward</b></font>) eye. I traced the shape of his (<font color='blue'><b>Edward</b></font>)
perfect nose, and then, so carefully, his (<font color='blue'><b>Edward</b></font>) flawless lips. His (<font color='blue'><b>Edward</b></font>) lips parted under my hand, and I could feel his (<font color='blue'><b>Edward</b></font>)
cool breath on my fingertips. I wanted to lean in, to inhale the scent of him (<font color='blue'><b>Edward</b></font>). So I dropped my hand and
leaned away, not wanting to push him (<font color='blue'><b>Edward</b></font>) too far.
He (<font color='blue'><b>Edward</b></font>) opened his (<font color='blue'><b>Edward</b></font>) eyes, and they were hungry. Not in a way to make me fear, but rather to tighten the
muscles in the pit of my stomach and send my pulse hammering through my veins again.
<div class="bookquote">``I wish,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Edward</b></font>) whispered, <div class="bookquote">``I wish you could feel the complexity the confusion I feel. That you could
understand.''
 (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>He (<font color='blue'><b>Edward</b></font>) raised his (<font color='blue'><b>Edward</b></font>) hand to my hair, then carefully brushed it across my face.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Tell me,''  (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div>I breathed.
<div class="bookquote">``I don't think I can. I've told you, on the one hand, the hunger  the thirst  that, deplorable creature
that I am, I feel for you. And I think you can understand that, to an extent. Though''   (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Edward</b></font>) half-smiled 
``as you are not addicted to any illegal substances, you probably can't empathize completely.
``But'' His (<font color='blue'><b>Edward</b></font>) fingers touched my lips lightly, making me shiver again. ``There are other hungers. Hungers I
don't even understand, that are foreign to me.''
``I may understand that better than you think.''
``I'm not used to feeling so human. Is it always like this?''
``For me?'' I paused. ``No, never. Never before this.''
He (<font color='blue'><b>Edward</b></font>) held my hands between his (<font color='blue'><b>Edward</b></font>). They felt so feeble in his (<font color='blue'><b>Edward</b></font>) iron strength.
``I don't know how to be close to you,'' he (<font color='blue'><b>Edward</b></font>) admitted. ``I don't know if I can.''
I leaned forward very slowly, cautioning him (<font color='blue'><b>Edward</b></font>) with my eyes. I placed my cheek against his (<font color='blue'><b>Edward</b></font>) stone chest. I
could hear his (<font color='blue'><b>Edward</b></font>) breath, and nothing else.
``This is enough,'' I sighed, closing my eyes.
In a very human gesture, he (<font color='blue'><b>Edward</b></font>) put his (<font color='blue'><b>Edward</b></font>) arms around me and pressed his (<font color='blue'><b>Edward</b></font>) face against my hair.
``You're better at this than you give yourself credit for,'' I noted.
``I have human instincts  they may be buried deep, but they're there.''
We sat like that for another immeasurable moment; I wondered if he (<font color='blue'><b>Edward</b></font>) could be as unwilling to move as I
was. But I could see the light was fading, the shadows of the forest beginning to touch us, and I sighed.
``You have to go.''
``I thought you couldn't read my mind.''
``It's getting clearer.'' I could hear a smile in his (<font color='blue'><b>Edward</b></font>) voice.
He (<font color='blue'><b>Edward</b></font>) took my shoulders and I looked into his (<font color='blue'><b>Edward</b></font>) face.
``Can I show you something?'' he (<font color='blue'><b>Edward</b></font>) asked, sudden excitement flaring in his (<font color='blue'><b>Edward</b></font>) eyes.
``Show me what?''
``I'll show you how I travel in the forest.'' He (<font color='blue'><b>Edward</b></font>) saw my expression. ``Don't worry, you'll be very safe, and
we'll get to your truck much faster.'' His (<font color='blue'><b>Edward</b></font>) mouth twitched up into that crooked smile so beautiful my heart
nearly stopped.
``Will you turn into a bat?'' I asked warily.
He (<font color='blue'><b>Edward</b></font>) laughed, louder than I'd ever heard. ``Like I haven't heard that one before!''
``Right, I'm sure you get that all the time.''
<div class="bookquote">``Come on, little coward, climb on my back.''

 (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div><p/>I waited to see if he (<font color='blue'><b>Edward</b></font>) was kidding, but, apparently, he (<font color='blue'><b>Edward</b></font>) meant it. He (<font color='blue'><b>Edward</b></font>) smiled as he (<font color='blue'><b>Edward</b></font>) read my hesitation, and
reached for me. My heart reacted; even though he (<font color='blue'><b>Edward</b></font>) couldn't hear my thoughts, my pulse always gave me
away. He (<font color='blue'><b>Edward</b></font>) then proceeded to sling me onto his (<font color='blue'><b>Edward</b></font>) back, with very little effort on my part, besides, when in
place, clamping my legs and arms so tightly around him (<font color='blue'><b>Edward</b></font>) that it would choke a normal person. It was like
clinging to a stone.
<div class="bookquote">``I'm a bit heavier than your average backpack,''  (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div>I warned.
<div class="bookquote">``Hah!''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Edward</b></font>) snorted. I could almost hear his (<font color='blue'><b>Edward</b></font>) eyes rolling. I'd never seen him (<font color='blue'><b>Edward</b></font>) in such high spirits before.
He (<font color='blue'><b>Edward</b></font>) startled me, suddenly grabbing my hand, pressing my palm to his (<font color='blue'><b>Edward</b></font>) face, and inhaling deeply.
<div class="bookquote">``Easier all the time,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Edward</b></font>) muttered.
And then he (<font color='blue'><b>Edward</b></font>) was running.
If I'd ever feared death before in his (<font color='blue'><b>Edward</b></font>) presence, it was nothing compared to how I felt now.
He (<font color='blue'><b>Edward</b></font>) streaked through the dark, thick underbrush of the forest like a bullet, like a ghost. There was no
sound, no evidence that his (<font color='blue'><b>Edward</b></font>) feet touched the earth. His (<font color='blue'><b>Edward</b></font>) breathing never changed, never indicated any
effort. But the trees flew by at deadly speeds, always missing us by inches.
I was too terrified to close my eyes, though the cool forest air whipped against my face and burned them.
I felt as if I were stupidly sticking my head out the window of an airplane in flight. And, for the first time in
my life, I felt the dizzy faintness of motion sickness.
Then it was over. We'd hiked hours this morning to reach Edward's meadow, and now, in a matter of
minutes, we were back to the truck.
<div class="bookquote">``Exhilarating, isn't it?''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>His (<font color='blue'><b>Edward</b></font>) voice was high, excited.
He (<font color='blue'><b>Edward</b></font>) stood motionless, waiting for me to climb down. I tried, but my muscles wouldn't respond. My arms
and legs stayed locked around him (<font color='blue'><b>Edward</b></font>) while my head spun uncomfortably.
<div class="bookquote">``Bella?''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Edward</b></font>) asked, anxious now.
<div class="bookquote">``I think I need to lie down,''  (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div>I gasped.
<div class="bookquote">``Oh, sorry.''  (<font color='red'><b>He</b></font>)</div>He (<font color='blue'><b>Edward</b></font>) waited for me, but I still couldn't move.
<div class="bookquote">``I think I need help,''  (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div>I admitted.
He (<font color='blue'><b>Edward</b></font>) laughed quietly, and gently unloosened my stranglehold on his (<font color='blue'><b>Edward</b></font>) neck. There was no resisting the iron
strength of his (<font color='blue'><b>Edward</b></font>) hands. Then he (<font color='blue'><b>Edward</b></font>) pulled me around to face him (<font color='blue'><b>Edward</b></font>), cradling me in his (<font color='blue'><b>Edward</b></font>) arms like a small child. He (<font color='blue'><b>Edward</b></font>)
held me for a moment, then carefully placed me on the springy ferns.
<div class="bookquote">``How do you feel?''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Edward</b></font>) asked.
I couldn't be sure how I felt when my head was spinning so crazily. <div class="bookquote">``Dizzy, I think.''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``Put your head between your knees.''
 (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div>I tried that, and it helped a little. I breathed in and out slowly, keeping my head very still. I felt him (<font color='blue'><b>Edward</b></font>) sitting
beside me. The moments passed, and eventually I found that I could raise my head. There was a hollow
ringing sound in my ears.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``I guess that wasn't the best idea,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Edward</b></font>) mused.
I tried to be positive, but my voice was weak. <div class="bookquote">``No, it was very interesting.''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``Hah! You're as white as a ghost  no, you're as white as me!''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``I think I should have closed my eyes.''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``Remember that next time.''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``Next time!''  (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div>I groaned.
He (<font color='blue'><b>Edward</b></font>) laughed, his (<font color='blue'><b>Edward</b></font>) mood still radiant.
<div class="bookquote">``Show-off,''  (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div>I muttered.
<div class="bookquote">``Open your eyes, Bella,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Edward</b></font>) said quietly.
And he (<font color='blue'><b>Edward</b></font>) was right there, his (<font color='blue'><b>Edward</b></font>) face so close to mine. His (<font color='blue'><b>Edward</b></font>) beauty stunned my mind  it was too much, an
excess I couldn't grow accustomed to.
<div class="bookquote">``I was thinking, while I was running''  (<font color='red'><b>He</b></font>)</div>He (<font color='blue'><b>Edward</b></font>) paused.
<div class="bookquote">``About not hitting the trees, I hope.''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``Silly Bella,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Edward</b></font>) chuckled. <div class="bookquote">``Running is second nature to me, it's not something I have to think about.''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``Show-off,''  (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div>I muttered again.
He (<font color='blue'><b>Edward</b></font>) smiled.
<div class="bookquote">``No,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Edward</b></font>) continued, <div class="bookquote">``I was thinking there was something I wanted to try.''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>And he (<font color='blue'><b>Edward</b></font>) took my face in his (<font color='blue'><b>Edward</b></font>)
hands again.
I couldn't breathe.
He (<font color='blue'><b>Edward</b></font>) hesitated  not in the normal way, the human way.
Not the way a man might hesitate before he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) kissed a woman, to gauge her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) reaction, to see how he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) would
be received. Perhaps he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) would hesitate to prolong the moment, that ideal moment of anticipation,
sometimes better than the kiss itself.
Edward hesitated to test himself, to see if this was safe, to make sure he (<font color='blue'><b>Edward</b></font>) was still in control of his (<font color='blue'><b>Edward</b></font>) need.
And then his (<font color='blue'><b>Edward</b></font>) cold, marble lips pressed very softly against mine.
What neither of us was prepared for was my response.
Blood boiled under my skin, burned in my lips. My breath came in a wild gasp. My fingers knotted in his (<font color='blue'><b>Edward</b></font>)
hair, clutching him (<font color='blue'><b>Edward</b></font>) to me. My lips parted as I breathed in his (<font color='blue'><b>Edward</b></font>) heady scent.
Immediately I felt him (<font color='blue'><b>Edward</b></font>) turn to unresponsive stone beneath my lips. His (<font color='blue'><b>Edward</b></font>) hands gently, but with irresistible
force, pushed my face back. I opened my eyes and saw his (<font color='blue'><b>Edward</b></font>) guarded expression.
<div class="bookquote">``Oops,''  (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div>I breathed.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``That's an understatement.''
 (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>His (<font color='blue'><b>Edward</b></font>) eyes were wild, his (<font color='blue'><b>Edward</b></font>) jaw clenched in acute restraint, yet he (<font color='blue'><b>Edward</b></font>) didn't lapse from his (<font color='blue'><b>Edward</b></font>) perfect articulation.
He (<font color='blue'><b>Edward</b></font>) held my face just inches from his (<font color='blue'><b>Edward</b></font>). He (<font color='blue'><b>Edward</b></font>) dazzled my eyes.
<div class="bookquote">``Should I ?''  (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div>I tried to disengage myself, to give him (<font color='blue'><b>Edward</b></font>) some room.
His (<font color='blue'><b>Edward</b></font>) hands refused to let me move so much as an inch.
<div class="bookquote">``No, it's tolerable. Wait for a moment, please.''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>His (<font color='blue'><b>Edward</b></font>) voice was polite, controlled.
I kept my eyes on his (<font color='blue'><b>Edward</b></font>), watched as the excitement in them faded and gentled.
Then he (<font color='blue'><b>Edward</b></font>) smiled a surprisingly impish grin.
<div class="bookquote">``There,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Edward</b></font>) said, obviously pleased with himself.
<div class="bookquote">``Tolerable?''  (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div>I asked.
He (<font color='blue'><b>Edward</b></font>) laughed aloud. <div class="bookquote">``I'm stronger than I thought. It's nice to know.''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``I wish I could say the same. I'm sorry.''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``You are only human, after all.''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``Thanks so much,''  (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div>I said, my voice acerbic.
He (<font color='blue'><b>Edward</b></font>) was on his (<font color='blue'><b>Edward</b></font>) feet in one of his (<font color='blue'><b>Edward</b></font>) lithe, almost invisibly quick movements. He (<font color='blue'><b>Edward</b></font>) held out his (<font color='blue'><b>Edward</b></font>) hand to me, an
unexpected gesture. I was so used to our standard of careful non-contact. I took his (<font color='blue'><b>Edward</b></font>) icy hand, needing
the support more than I thought. My balance had not yet returned.
<div class="bookquote">``Are you still faint from the run? Or was it my kissing expertise?''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>How lighthearted, how human he (<font color='blue'><b>Edward</b></font>)
seemed as he (<font color='blue'><b>Edward</b></font>) laughed now, his (<font color='blue'><b>Edward</b></font>) seraphic face untroubled. He (<font color='blue'><b>Edward</b></font>) was a different Edward than the one I had
known. And I felt all the more besotted by him (<font color='blue'><b>Edward</b></font>). It would cause me physical pain to be separated from
him (<font color='blue'><b>Edward</b></font>) now.
<div class="bookquote">``I can't be sure, I'm still woozy,''  (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div>I managed to respond. <div class="bookquote">``I think it's some of both, though.''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``Maybe you should let me drive.''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``Are you insane?''  (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div>I protested.
<div class="bookquote">``I can drive better than you on your best day,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Edward</b></font>) teased. <div class="bookquote">``You have much slower reflexes.''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``I'm sure that's true, but I don't think my nerves, or my truck, could take it.''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``Some trust, please, Bella.''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>My hand was in my pocket, curled tightly around the key. I pursed my lips, deliberated, then shook my
head with a tight grin.
<div class="bookquote">``Nope. Not a chance.''
 (<font color='red'><b>He</b></font>)</div>He (<font color='blue'><b>Edward</b></font>) raised his (<font color='blue'><b>Edward</b></font>) eyebrows in disbelief.
I started to step around him (<font color='blue'><b>Edward</b></font>), heading for the driver's side. He (<font color='blue'><b>Edward</b></font>) might have let me pass if I hadn't wobbled

<p/>slightly. Then again, he (<font color='blue'><b>Edward</b></font>) might not have. His (<font color='blue'><b>Edward</b></font>) arm created an inescapable snare around my waist.
<div class="bookquote">``Bella, I've already expended a great deal of personal effort at this point to keep you alive. I'm not about
to let you behind the wheel of a vehicle when you can't even walk straight. Besides, friends don't let
friends drive drunk,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Edward</b></font>) quoted with a chuckle. I could smell the unbearably sweet fragrance coming off
his (<font color='blue'><b>Edward</b></font>) chest.
<div class="bookquote">``Drunk?''  (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div>I objected.
<div class="bookquote">``You're intoxicated by my very presence.''  (<font color='red'><b>He</b></font>)</div>He (<font color='blue'><b>Edward</b></font>) was grinning that playful smirk again.
<div class="bookquote">``I can't argue with that,''  (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div>I sighed. There was no way around it; I couldn't resist him (<font color='blue'><b>Edward</b></font>) in anything. I held the
key high and dropped it, watching his (<font color='blue'><b>Edward</b></font>) hand flash like lightning to catch it soundlessly. <div class="bookquote">``Take it easy  my
truck is a senior citizen.''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``Very sensible,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Edward</b></font>) approved.
<div class="bookquote">``And are you not affected at all?''  (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div>I asked, irked. <div class="bookquote">``By my presence?''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>Again his (<font color='blue'><b>Edward</b></font>) mobile features transformed, his (<font color='blue'><b>Edward</b></font>) expression became soft, warm. He (<font color='blue'><b>Edward</b></font>) didn't answer at first; he (<font color='blue'><b>Edward</b></font>)
simply bent his (<font color='blue'><b>Edward</b></font>) face to mine, and brushed his (<font color='blue'><b>Edward</b></font>) lips slowly along my jaw, from my ear to my chin, back and
forth. I trembled.
<div class="bookquote">``Regardless,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Edward</b></font>) finally murmured, <div class="bookquote">``I have better reflexes.''

 (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div><p/>14. MIND OVER MATTER

<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Edward</b></font>) could drive well, when he (<font color='blue'><b>Edward</b></font>) kept the speed reasonable, I had to admit. Like so many things, it seemed
to be effortless to him (<font color='blue'><b>Edward</b></font>). He (<font color='blue'><b>Edward</b></font>) barely looked at the road, yet the tires never deviated so much as a centimeter
from the center of the lane. He (<font color='blue'><b>Edward</b></font>) drove one-handed, holding my hand on the seat. Sometimes he (<font color='blue'><b>Edward</b></font>) gazed into
the setting sun, sometimes he (<font color='blue'><b>Edward</b></font>) glanced at me  my face, my hair blowing out the open window, our
hands twined together.
He (<font color='blue'><b>Edward</b></font>) had turned the radio to an oldies station, and he (<font color='blue'><b>Edward</b></font>) sang along with a song I'd never heard. He (<font color='blue'><b>Edward</b></font>) knew

<div class="bookquote">``You like fifties music?''  (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div>I asked.
<div class="bookquote">``Music in the fifties was good. Much better than the sixties, or the seventies, ugh!''  (<font color='red'><b>He</b></font>)</div>He (<font color='blue'><b>Edward</b></font>) shuddered. <div class="bookquote">``The
eighties were bearable.''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``Are you ever going to tell me how old you are?''  (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div>I asked, tentative, not wanting to upset his (<font color='blue'><b>Edward</b></font>) buoyant
humor.
<div class="bookquote">``Does it matter much?''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>His (<font color='blue'><b>Edward</b></font>) smile, to my relief, remained unclouded.
<div class="bookquote">``No, but I still wonder''  (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div>I grimaced. <div class="bookquote">``There's nothing like an unsolved mystery to keep you up at night.''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``I wonder if it will upset you,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Edward</b></font>) reflected to himself. He (<font color='blue'><b>Edward</b></font>) gazed into the sun; the minutes passed.
<div class="bookquote">``Try me,''  (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div>I finally said.

<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Edward</b></font>) sighed, and then looked into my eyes, seeming to forget the road completely for a time. Whatever he (<font color='blue'><b>Edward</b></font>)
saw there must have encouraged him (<font color='blue'><b>Edward</b></font>). He (<font color='blue'><b>Edward</b></font>) looked into the sun  the light of the setting orb glittered off
his (<font color='blue'><b>Edward</b></font>) skin in ruby-tinged sparkles  and spoke.
<div class="bookquote">``I was born in Chicago in 1901.''  (<font color='red'><b>He</b></font>)</div>He (<font color='blue'><b>Edward</b></font>) paused and glanced at me from the corner of his (<font color='blue'><b>Edward</b></font>) eyes. My face was
carefully unsurprised, patient for the rest. He (<font color='blue'><b>Edward</b></font>) smiled a tiny smile and continued. <div class="bookquote">``Carlisle found me in a
hospital in the summer of 1918. I was seventeen, and dying of the Spanish influenza.''
 (<font color='red'><b>He</b></font>)</div>He (<font color='blue'><b>Edward</b></font>) heard my intake of breath, though it was barely audible to my own ears. He (<font color='blue'><b>Edward</b></font>) looked down into my
eyes again.
<div class="bookquote">``I don't remember it well  it was a very long time ago, and human memories fade.''  (<font color='red'><b>He</b></font>)</div>He (<font color='blue'><b>Edward</b></font>) was lost in his (<font color='blue'><b>Edward</b></font>)
thoughts for a short time before he (<font color='blue'><b>Edward</b></font>) went on. <div class="bookquote">``I do remember how it felt, when Carlisle saved me. It's not
an easy thing, not something you could forget.''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``Your parents?''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``They had already died from the disease. I was alone. That was why he (<font color='blue'><b>Carlisle</b></font>) chose me. In all the chaos of the
epidemic, no one would ever realize I was gone.''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``How did he (<font color='blue'><b>Carlisle</b></font>) save you?''
 (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>A few seconds passed before he (<font color='blue'><b>Edward</b></font>) answered. He (<font color='blue'><b>Edward</b></font>) seemed to choose his (<font color='blue'><b>Edward</b></font>) words carefully.
<div class="bookquote">``It was difficult. Not many of us have the restraint necessary to accomplish it. But Carlisle has always
been the most humane, the most compassionate of us I don't think you could find his (<font color='blue'><b>Carlisle</b></font>) equal throughout
all of history.''  (<font color='red'><b>He</b></font>)</div>He (<font color='blue'><b>Edward</b></font>) paused. <div class="bookquote">``For me, it was merely very, very painful.''
 (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div>I could tell from the set of his (<font color='blue'><b>Edward</b></font>) lips, he (<font color='blue'><b>Edward</b></font>) would say no more on this subject. I suppressed my curiosity,
though it was far from idle. There were many things I needed to think through on this particular issue,
things that were only beginning to occur to me. No doubt his (<font color='blue'><b>Edward</b></font>) quick mind had already comprehended
every aspect that eluded me.
His (<font color='blue'><b>Edward</b></font>) soft voice interrupted my thoughts. <div class="bookquote">``He (<font color='blue'><b>Carlisle</b></font>) acted from loneliness. That's usually the reason behind the
choice. I was the first in Carlisle's family, though he (<font color='blue'><b>Carlisle</b></font>) found Esme soon after. She (<font color='blue'><b>family</b></font>) fell from a cliff. They
brought her (<font color='blue'><b>family</b></font>) straight to the hospital morgue, though, somehow, her (<font color='blue'><b>family</b></font>) heart was still beating.''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``So you must be dying, then, to become''  (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div>We never said the word, and I couldn't frame it now.
<div class="bookquote">``No, that's just Carlisle. He (<font color='blue'><b>Carlisle</b></font>) would never do that to someone who had another choice.''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>The respect in his (<font color='blue'><b>Edward</b></font>)
voice was profound whenever he (<font color='blue'><b>Edward</b></font>) spoke of his (<font color='blue'><b>Edward</b></font>) father figure. <div class="bookquote">``It is easier he (<font color='blue'><b>Carlisle</b></font>) says, though,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Edward</b></font>) continued, <div class="bookquote">``if
the blood is weak.''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>He (<font color='blue'><b>Edward</b></font>) looked at the now-dark road, and I could feel the subject closing again.
<div class="bookquote">``And Emmett and Rosalie?''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``Carlisle brought Rosalie to our family next. I didn't realize till much later that he (<font color='blue'><b>Emmett</b></font>) was hoping she (<font color='blue'><b>Rosalie</b></font>) would be
to me what Esme was to him (<font color='blue'><b>Emmett</b></font>)  he (<font color='blue'><b>Emmett</b></font>) was careful with his (<font color='blue'><b>Emmett</b></font>) thoughts around me.''  (<font color='red'><b>He</b></font>)</div>He (<font color='blue'><b>Edward</b></font>) rolled his (<font color='blue'><b>Edward</b></font>) eyes. <div class="bookquote">``But
she (<font color='blue'><b>Rosalie</b></font>) was never more than a sister. It was only two years later that she (<font color='blue'><b>Rosalie</b></font>) found Emmett. She (<font color='blue'><b>Rosalie</b></font>) was hunting 
we were in Appalachia at the time  and found a bear about to finish him (<font color='blue'><b>Emmett</b></font>) off. She (<font color='blue'><b>Rosalie</b></font>) carried him (<font color='blue'><b>Emmett</b></font>) back to
Carlisle, more than a hundred miles, afraid she (<font color='blue'><b>Rosalie</b></font>) wouldn't be able to do it herself. I'm only beginning to
guess how difficult that journey was for her (<font color='blue'><b>Rosalie</b></font>).''  (<font color='red'><b>He</b></font>)</div>He (<font color='blue'><b>Edward</b></font>) threw a pointed glance in my direction, and raised our
hands, still folded together, to brush my cheek with the back of his (<font color='blue'><b>Edward</b></font>) hand.
<div class="bookquote">``But she (<font color='blue'><b>Rosalie</b></font>) made it,''  (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div>I encouraged, looking away from the unbearable beauty of his (<font color='blue'><b>Edward</b></font>) eyes.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Yes,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Edward</b></font>) murmured. <div class="bookquote">``She (<font color='blue'><b>Rosalie</b></font>) saw something in his (<font color='blue'><b>Emmett</b></font>) face that made her (<font color='blue'><b>Rosalie</b></font>) strong enough. And they've been
together ever since. Sometimes they live separately from us, as a married couple. But the younger we
pretend to be, the longer we can stay in any given place. Forks seemed perfect, so we all enrolled in high
school.''  (<font color='red'><b>He</b></font>)</div>He (<font color='blue'><b>Edward</b></font>) laughed. <div class="bookquote">``I suppose we'll have to go to their wedding in a few years, again.''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``Alice and Jasper?''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``Alice and Jasper are two very rare creatures. They both developed a conscience, as we refer to it, with
no outside guidance. Jasper belonged to another family, a very different kind of family. He (<font color='blue'><b>Jasper</b></font>) became
depressed, and he (<font color='blue'><b>Jasper</b></font>) wandered on his (<font color='blue'><b>Jasper</b></font>) own. Alice found him (<font color='blue'><b>Jasper</b></font>). Like me, she (<font color='blue'><b>Alice</b></font>) has certain gifts above and
beyond the norm for our kind.''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``Really?''  (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div>I interrupted, fascinated. <div class="bookquote">``But you said you were the only one who could hear people's
thoughts.''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``That's true. She (<font color='blue'><b>Alice</b></font>) knows other things. She (<font color='blue'><b>Alice</b></font>) sees things  things that might happen, things that are coming.
But it's very subjective. The future isn't set in stone. Things change.''
 (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>His (<font color='blue'><b>Edward</b></font>) jaw set when he (<font color='blue'><b>Edward</b></font>) said that, and his (<font color='blue'><b>Edward</b></font>) eyes darted to my face and away so quickly that I wasn't sure if I
only imagined it.
<div class="bookquote">``What kinds of things does she (<font color='blue'><b>Alice</b></font>) see?''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``She (<font color='blue'><b>Alice</b></font>) saw Jasper and knew that he (<font color='blue'><b>Jasper</b></font>) was looking for her (<font color='blue'><b>Alice</b></font>) before he (<font color='blue'><b>Jasper</b></font>) knew it himself. She (<font color='blue'><b>Alice</b></font>) saw Carlisle and
our family, and they came together to find us. She (<font color='blue'><b>Alice</b></font>)'s most sensitive to non-humans. She (<font color='blue'><b>Alice</b></font>) always sees, for
example, when another group of our kind is coming near. And any threat they may pose.''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``Are there a lot of your kind?''  (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div>I was surprised. How many of them could walk among us undetected?
<div class="bookquote">``No, not many. But most won't settle in any one place. Only those like us, who've given up hunting you
people''   (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>a sly glance in my direction  <div class="bookquote">``can live together with humans for any length of time. We've
only found one other family like ours, in a small village in Alaska. We lived together for a time, but there
were so many of us that we became too noticeable. Those of us who live differently tend to band
together.''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``And the others?''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``Nomads, for the most part. We've all lived that way at times. It gets tedious, like anything else. But we
run across the others now and then, because most of us prefer the North.''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``Why is that?''
 (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>We were parked in front of my house now, and he (<font color='blue'><b>Edward</b></font>)'d turned off the truck. It was very quiet and dark;
there was no moon. The porch light was off so I knew my father wasn't home yet.
<div class="bookquote">``Did you have your eyes open this afternoon?''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) teased. <div class="bookquote">``Do you think I could walk down the street in
the sunlight without causing traffic accidents? There's a reason why we chose the Olympic Peninsula, one
of the most sunless places in the world. It's nice to be able to go outside in the day. You wouldn't believe
how tired you can get of nighttime in eighty-odd years.''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``So that's where the legends came from?''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``Probably.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``And Alice came from another family, like Jasper?''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``No, and that is a mystery. Alice doesn't remember her (<font color='blue'><b>Alice</b></font>) human life at all. And she (<font color='blue'><b>Alice</b></font>) doesn't know who
created her (<font color='blue'><b>Alice</b></font>). She (<font color='blue'><b>Alice</b></font>) awoke alone. Whoever made her (<font color='blue'><b>Alice</b></font>) walked away, and none of us understand why, or
how, he (<font color='blue'><b>Jasper</b></font>) could. If she (<font color='blue'><b>Alice</b></font>) hadn't had that other sense, if she (<font color='blue'><b>Alice</b></font>) hadn't seen Jasper and Carlisle and known that
she (<font color='blue'><b>Alice</b></font>) would someday become one of us, she (<font color='blue'><b>Alice</b></font>) probably would have turned into a total savage.''
 (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div>There was so much to think through, so much I still wanted to ask. But, to my great embarrassment, my
stomach growled. I'd been so intrigued, I hadn't even noticed I was hungry. I realized now that I was
ravenous.
<div class="bookquote">``I'm sorry, I'm keeping you from dinner.''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``I'm fine, really.''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``I've never spent much time around anyone who eats food. I forget.''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``I want to stay with you.''  (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div>It was easier to say in the darkness, knowing as I spoke how my voice would
betray me, my hopeless addiction to him (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>).
<div class="bookquote">``Can't I come in?''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) asked.
<div class="bookquote">``Would you like to?''  (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div>I couldn't picture it, this godlike creature sitting in my father's shabby kitchen chair.
<div class="bookquote">``Yes, if it's all right.''  (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div>I heard the door close quietly, and almost simultaneously he (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) was outside my door,
opening it for me.
<div class="bookquote">``Very human,''  (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div>I complimented him (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>).
<div class="bookquote">``It's definitely resurfacing.''
 (<font color='red'><b>He</b></font>)</div>He (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) walked beside me in the night, so quietly I had to peek at him (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) constantly to be sure he (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) was still there.
In the darkness he (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) looked much more normal. Still pale, still dreamlike in his (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) beauty, but no longer the
fantastic sparkling creature of our sunlit afternoon.
He (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) reached the door ahead of me and opened it for me. I paused halfway through the frame.
<div class="bookquote">``The door was unlocked?''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``No, I used the key from under the eave.''
 (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div>I stepped inside, flicked on the porch light, and turned to look at him (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) with my eyebrows raised. I was
sure I'd never used that key in front of him (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>).
<div class="bookquote">``I was curious about you.''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``You spied on me?''  (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div>But somehow I couldn't infuse my voice with the proper outrage. I was flattered.
He (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) was unrepentant. <div class="bookquote">``What else is there to do at night?''
 (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div>I let it go for the moment and went down the hall to the kitchen. He (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) was there before me, needing no
guide. He (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) sat in the very chair I'd tried to picture him (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) in. His (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) beauty lit up the kitchen. It was a moment
before I could look away.
I concentrated on getting my dinner, taking last night's lasagna from the fridge, placing a square on a

<p/>plate, heating it in the microwave. It revolved, filling the kitchen with the smell of tomatoes and oregano. I
didn't take my eyes from the plate of food as I spoke.
<div class="bookquote">``How often?''  (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div>I asked casually.
<div class="bookquote">``Hmmm?''  (<font color='red'><b>He</b></font>)</div>He (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) sounded as if I had pulled him (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) from some other train of thought.
I still didn't turn around. <div class="bookquote">``How often did you come here?''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``I come here almost every night.''
 (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div>I whirled, stunned. <div class="bookquote">``Why?''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``You're interesting when you sleep.''  (<font color='red'><b>He</b></font>)</div>He (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) spoke matter-of-factly. <div class="bookquote">``You talk.''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``No!''  (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div>I gasped, heat flooding my face all the way to my hairline. I gripped the kitchen counter for
support. I knew I talked in my sleep, of course; my mother teased me about it. I hadn't thought it was
something I needed to worry about here, though.
His (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) expression shifted instantly to chagrin. <div class="bookquote">``Are you very angry with me?''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``That depends!''  (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div>I felt and sounded like I'd had the breath knocked out of me.
He (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) waited.
<div class="bookquote">``On?''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) urged.
<div class="bookquote">``What you heard!''  (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div>I wailed.
Instantly, silently, he (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) was at my side, taking my hands carefully in his (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>).
<div class="bookquote">``Don't be upset!''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) pleaded. He (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) dropped his (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) face to the level of my eyes, holding my gaze. I was
embarrassed. I tried to look away.
<div class="bookquote">``You miss your mother,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) whispered. ``You worry about her (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>). And when it rains, the sound makes you
restless. You used to talk about home a lot, but it's less often now. Once you said, ``It's too green.''' He (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>)
laughed softly, hoping, I could see, not to offend me further.
``Anything else?'' I demanded.
He (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) knew what I was getting at. ``You did say my name,'' he (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) admitted.
I sighed in defeat. ``A lot?''
``How much do you mean by 'a lot,<div class="bookquote">'' exactly?''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``Oh no!''  (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div>I hung my head.
He (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) pulled me against his (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) chest, softly, naturally.
<div class="bookquote">``Don't be self-conscious,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) whispered in my ear. <div class="bookquote">``If I could dream at all, it would be about you. And
I'm not ashamed of it.''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>Then we both heard the sound of tires on the brick driveway, saw the headlights flash through the front
windows, down the hall to us. I stiffened in his (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) arms.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Should your father know I'm here?''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) asked.
<div class="bookquote">``I'm not sure''  (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div>I tried to think it through quickly.
<div class="bookquote">``Another time then''
 (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div>And I was alone.
<div class="bookquote">``Edward!''  (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div>I hissed.
I heard a ghostly chuckle, then nothing else.
My father's key turned in the door.
<div class="bookquote">``Bella?''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) called. It had bothered me before; who else would it be? Suddenly he (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) didn't seem so far off
base.
<div class="bookquote">``In here.''  (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div>I hoped he (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) couldn't hear the hysterical edge to my voice. I grabbed my dinner from the
microwave and sat at the table as he (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) walked in. His (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) footsteps sounded so noisy after my day with
Edward.
<div class="bookquote">``Can you get me some of that? I'm bushed.''  (<font color='red'><b>He</b></font>)</div>He (<font color='blue'><b>Edward</b></font>) stepped on the heels of his (<font color='blue'><b>Edward</b></font>) boots to take them off,
holding the back of Edward's chair for support.
I took my food with me, scarfing it down as I got his (<font color='blue'><b>Edward</b></font>) dinner. It burned my tongue. I filled two glasses with
milk while his (<font color='blue'><b>Edward</b></font>) lasagna was heating, and gulped mine to put out the fire. As I set the glass down, I noticed
the milk trembling and realized my hand was shaking. Charlie sat in the chair, and the contrast between
him (<font color='blue'><b>Charlie</b></font>) and its former occupant was comical.
<div class="bookquote">``Thanks,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Charlie</b></font>) said as I placed his (<font color='blue'><b>Charlie</b></font>) food on the table.
<div class="bookquote">``How was your day?''  (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div>I asked. The words were rushed; I was dying to escape to my room.
<div class="bookquote">``Good. The fish were biting how about you? Did you get everything done that you wanted to?''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``Not really  it was too nice out to stay indoors.''  (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div>I took another big bite.
<div class="bookquote">``It was a nice day,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Charlie</b></font>) agreed. What an understatement, I thought to myself.
Finished with the last bite of lasagna, I lifted my glass and chugged the remains of my milk.
Charlie surprised me by being observant. <div class="bookquote">``In a hurry?''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``Yeah, I'm tired. I'm going to bed early.''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``You look kinda keyed up,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Charlie</b></font>) noted. Why, oh why, did this have to be his (<font color='blue'><b>Charlie</b></font>) night to pay attention?
<div class="bookquote">``Do I?''  (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div>was all I could manage in response. I quickly scrubbed my dishes clean in the sink, and placed
them upside down on a dish towel to dry.
<div class="bookquote">``It's Saturday,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Charlie</b></font>) mused.
I didn't respond.
<div class="bookquote">``No plans tonight?''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Charlie</b></font>) asked suddenly.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``No, Dad, I just want to get some sleep.''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``None of the boys in town your type, eh?''  (<font color='red'><b>He</b></font>)</div>He (<font color='blue'><b>Charlie</b></font>) was suspicious, but trying to play it cool.
<div class="bookquote">``No, none of the boys have caught my eye yet.''  (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div>I was careful not to over-emphasize the word boys in
my quest to be truthful with Charlie.
<div class="bookquote">``I thought maybe that Mike Newton you said he (<font color='blue'><b>Newton</b></font>) was friendly.''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``He (<font color='blue'><b>Newton</b></font>)'s Just a friend, Dad.''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``Well, you're too good for them all, anyway. Wait till you get to college to start looking.''  (<font color='red'><b>Every father</b></font>)</div>Every father's
dream, that his (<font color='blue'><b>Charlie</b></font>) daughter will be out of the house before the hormones kick in.
<div class="bookquote">``Sounds like a good idea to me,''  (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div>I agreed as I headed up the stairs.
<div class="bookquote">''`Night, honey,''  (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Charlie</b></font>) called after me. No doubt he (<font color='blue'><b>Charlie</b></font>) would be listening carefully all evening, waiting for me to
try to sneak out.
<div class="bookquote">``See you in the morning, Dad.''  (<font color='red'><b>me</b></font>)</div>See you creeping into my room tonight at midnight to check on me.
I worked to make my tread sound slow and tired as I walked up the stairs to my room. I shut the door
loud enough for him (<font color='blue'><b>Charlie</b></font>) to hear, and then sprinted on my tiptoes to the window. I threw it open and leaned
out into the night. My eyes scanned the darkness, the impenetrable shadows of the trees.
<div class="bookquote">``Edward?''  (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div>I whispered, feeling completely idiotic.
The quiet, laughing response came from behind me. <div class="bookquote">``Yes?''
 (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div>I whirled, one hand flying to my throat in surprise.
He (<font color='blue'><b>Charlie</b></font>) lay, smiling hugely, across my bed, his (<font color='blue'><b>Charlie</b></font>) hands behind his (<font color='blue'><b>Charlie</b></font>) head, his (<font color='blue'><b>Charlie</b></font>) feet dangling off the end, the picture
of ease.
<div class="bookquote">``Oh!''  (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div>I breathed, sinking unsteadily to the floor.
<div class="bookquote">``I'm sorry.''  (<font color='red'><b>He</b></font>)</div>He (<font color='blue'><b>Charlie</b></font>) pressed his (<font color='blue'><b>Charlie</b></font>) lips together, trying to hide his (<font color='blue'><b>Charlie</b></font>) amusement.
<div class="bookquote">``Just give me a minute to restart my heart.''
 (<font color='red'><b>He</b></font>)</div>He (<font color='blue'><b>Charlie</b></font>) sat up slowly, so as not to startle me again. Then he (<font color='blue'><b>Charlie</b></font>) leaned forward and reached out with his (<font color='blue'><b>Charlie</b></font>) long
arms to pick me up, gripping the tops of my arms like I was a toddler. He (<font color='blue'><b>toddler</b></font>) sat me on the bed beside him (<font color='blue'><b>toddler</b></font>).
<div class="bookquote">``Why don't you sit with me,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>toddler</b></font>) suggested, putting a cold hand on mine. <div class="bookquote">``How's the heart?''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``You tell me  I'm sure you hear it better than I do.''
 (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div>I felt his (<font color='blue'><b>toddler</b></font>) quiet laughter shake the bed.
We sat there for a moment in silence, both listening to my heartbeat slow. I thought about having Edward
in my room, with my father in the house.
<div class="bookquote">``Can I have a minute to be human?''  (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div>I asked.
<div class="bookquote">``Certainly.''  (<font color='red'><b>He</b></font>)</div>He (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) gestured with one hand that I should proceed.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Stay,''  (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div>I said, trying to look severe.
<div class="bookquote">``Yes, ma'am.''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>And he (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) made a show of becoming a statue on the edge of my bed.
I hopped up, grabbing my pajamas from off the floor, my bag of toiletries off the desk. I left the light off
and slipped out, closing the door.
I could hear the sound from the TV rising up the stairs. I banged the bathroom door loudly, so Charlie
wouldn't come up to bother me.
I meant to hurry. I brushed my teeth fiercely, trying to be thorough and speedy, removing all traces of
lasagna. But the hot water of the shower couldn't be rushed. It unknotted the muscles in my back, calmed
my pulse. The familiar smell of my shampoo made me feel like I might be the same person I had been this
morning. I tried not to think of Edward, sitting in my room, waiting, because then I had to start all over
with the calming process. Finally, I couldn't delay anymore. I shut off the water, toweling hastily, rushing
again. I pulled on my holey t-shirt and gray sweatpants. Too late to regret not packing the Victoria's
Secret silk pajamas my mother got me two birthdays ago, which still had the tags on them in a drawer
somewhere back home.
I rubbed the towel through my hair again, and then yanked the brush through it quickly. I threw the towel
in the hamper, flung my brush and toothpaste into my bag. Then I dashed down the stairs so Charlie
could see that I was in my pajamas, with wet hair.
<div class="bookquote">''`Night, Dad.''
 (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">''`Night, Bella.''  (<font color='red'><b>He</b></font>)</div>He (<font color='blue'><b>Dad</b></font>) did look startled by my appearance. Maybe that would keep him (<font color='blue'><b>Dad</b></font>) from checking on
me tonight.
I took the stairs two at a time, trying to be quiet, and flew into my room, closing the door tightly behind
me.
Edward hadn't moved a fraction of an inch, a carving of Adonis perched on my faded quilt. I smiled, and
his (<font color='blue'><b>Adonis</b></font>) lips twitched, the statue coming to life.
His (<font color='blue'><b>Adonis</b></font>) eyes appraised me, taking in the damp hair, the tattered shirt. He (<font color='blue'><b>Adonis</b></font>) raised one eyebrow. <div class="bookquote">``Nice.''
 (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div>I grimaced.
<div class="bookquote">``No, it looks good on you.''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``Thanks,''  (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div>I whispered. I went back to his (<font color='blue'><b>Adonis</b></font>) side, sitting cross-legged beside him (<font color='blue'><b>Adonis</b></font>). I looked at the lines in the
wooden floor.
<div class="bookquote">``What was all that for?''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``Charlie thinks I'm sneaking out.''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``Oh.''  (<font color='red'><b>He</b></font>)</div>He (<font color='blue'><b>Adonis</b></font>) contemplated that. <div class="bookquote">``Why?''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>As if he (<font color='blue'><b>Adonis</b></font>) couldn't know Charlie's mind much more clearly than I
could guess.
<div class="bookquote">``Apparently, I look a little overexcited.''
 (<font color='red'><b>He</b></font>)</div>He (<font color='blue'><b>Charlie</b></font>) lifted my chin, examining my face.
<div class="bookquote">``You look very warm, actually.''

 (<font color='red'><b>He</b></font>)</div><p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Charlie</b></font>) bent his (<font color='blue'><b>Charlie</b></font>) face slowly to mine, laying his (<font color='blue'><b>Charlie</b></font>) cool cheek against my skin. I held perfectly still.
<div class="bookquote">``Mmmmmm''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Charlie</b></font>) breathed.
It was very difficult, while he (<font color='blue'><b>Charlie</b></font>) was touching me, to frame a coherent question. It took me a minute of
scattered concentration to begin.
<div class="bookquote">``It seems to be much easier for you, now, to be close to me.''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``Does it seem that way to you?''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Charlie</b></font>) murmured, his (<font color='blue'><b>Charlie</b></font>) nose gliding to the corner of my jaw. I felt his (<font color='blue'><b>Charlie</b></font>) hand,
lighter than a moth's wing, brushing my damp hair back, so that his (<font color='blue'><b>Charlie</b></font>) lips could touch the hollow beneath
my ear.
<div class="bookquote">``Much, much easier,''  (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div>I said, trying to exhale.
<div class="bookquote">``Hmm.''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``So I was wondering''  (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div>I began again, but his (<font color='blue'><b>Charlie</b></font>) fingers were slowly tracing my collarbone, and I lost my
train of thought.
<div class="bookquote">``Yes?''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Charlie</b></font>) breathed.
<div class="bookquote">``Why is that,''  (<font color='red'><b>me</b></font>)</div>my voice shook, embarrassing me, <div class="bookquote">``do you think?''
 (<font color='red'><b>me</b></font>)</div>I felt the tremor of his (<font color='blue'><b>Charlie</b></font>) breath on my neck as he (<font color='blue'><b>Charlie</b></font>) laughed. <div class="bookquote">``Mind over matter.''
 (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div>I pulled back; as I moved, he (<font color='blue'><b>Charlie</b></font>) froze  and I could no longer hear the sound of his (<font color='blue'><b>Charlie</b></font>) breathing.
We stared cautiously at each other for a moment, and then, as his (<font color='blue'><b>Charlie</b></font>) clenched jaw gradually relaxed, his (<font color='blue'><b>Charlie</b></font>)
expression became puzzled.
<div class="bookquote">``Did I do something wrong?''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``No  the opposite. You're driving me crazy,''  (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div>I explained.
He (<font color='blue'><b>Charlie</b></font>) considered that briefly, and when he (<font color='blue'><b>Charlie</b></font>) spoke, he (<font color='blue'><b>Charlie</b></font>) sounded pleased. <div class="bookquote">``Really?''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>A triumphant smile slowly
lit his (<font color='blue'><b>Charlie</b></font>) face.
<div class="bookquote">``Would you like a round of applause?''  (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div>I asked sarcastically.
He (<font color='blue'><b>Charlie</b></font>) grinned.
<div class="bookquote">``I'm just pleasantly surprised,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Charlie</b></font>) clarified. <div class="bookquote">``In the last hundred years or so,''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>his (<font color='blue'><b>Charlie</b></font>) voice was teasing, <div class="bookquote">``I
never imagined anything like this. I didn't believe I would ever find someone I wanted to be with in
another way than my brothers and sisters. And then to find, even though it's all new to me, that I'm good
at it at being with you''
 (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``You're good at everything,''  (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div>I pointed out.
He (<font color='blue'><b>Charlie</b></font>) shrugged, allowing that, and we both laughed in whispers.
<div class="bookquote">``But how can it be so easy now?''  (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div>I pressed. <div class="bookquote">``This afternoon''
 (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``It's not easy,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Charlie</b></font>) sighed. <div class="bookquote">``But this afternoon, I was still undecided. I am sorry about that, it was
unforgivable for me to behave so.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Not unforgivable,''  (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div>I disagreed.
<div class="bookquote">``Thank you.''  (<font color='red'><b>He</b></font>)</div>He (<font color='blue'><b>Charlie</b></font>) smiled. <div class="bookquote">``You see,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Charlie</b></font>) continued, looking down now, <div class="bookquote">``I wasn't sure if I was strong
enough''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>He (<font color='blue'><b>Charlie</b></font>) picked up one of my hands and pressed it lightly to his (<font color='blue'><b>Charlie</b></font>) face. <div class="bookquote">``And while there was still that
possibility that I might be overcome''   (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Charlie</b></font>) breathed in the scent at my wrist  <div class="bookquote">``I was susceptible.
Until I made up my mind that I was strong enough, that there was no possibility at all that I would that
I ever could''
 (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>I'd never seen him (<font color='blue'><b>Charlie</b></font>) struggle so hard for words. It was so human.
<div class="bookquote">``So there's no possibility now?''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``Mind over matter,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Charlie</b></font>) repeated, smiling, his (<font color='blue'><b>Charlie</b></font>) teeth bright even in the darkness.
<div class="bookquote">``Wow, that was easy,''  (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div>I said.
He (<font color='blue'><b>Charlie</b></font>) threw back his (<font color='blue'><b>Charlie</b></font>) head and laughed, quietly as a whisper, but still exuberantly.
<div class="bookquote">``Easy for you!''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Charlie</b></font>) amended, touching my nose with his (<font color='blue'><b>Charlie</b></font>) fingertip.
And then his (<font color='blue'><b>Charlie</b></font>) face was abruptly serious.
<div class="bookquote">``I'm trying,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Charlie</b></font>) whispered, his (<font color='blue'><b>Charlie</b></font>) voice pained. <div class="bookquote">``If it gets to be too much, I'm fairly sure I'll be able to
leave.''
 (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div>I scowled. I didn't like the talk of leaving.
<div class="bookquote">``And it will be harder tomorrow,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Charlie</b></font>) continued. <div class="bookquote">``I've had the scent of you in my head all day, and I've
grown amazingly desensitized. If I'm away from you for any length of time, I'll have to start over again.
Not quite from scratch, though, I think.''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``Don't go away, then,''  (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div>I responded, unable to hide the longing in my voice.
<div class="bookquote">``That suits me,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Charlie</b></font>) replied, his (<font color='blue'><b>Charlie</b></font>) face relaxing into a gentle smile. <div class="bookquote">``Bring on the shackles  I'm your
prisoner.''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>But his (<font color='blue'><b>Charlie</b></font>) long hands formed manacles around my wrists as he (<font color='blue'><b>Charlie</b></font>) spoke. He (<font color='blue'><b>Charlie</b></font>) laughed his (<font color='blue'><b>Charlie</b></font>) quiet,
musical laugh. He (<font color='blue'><b>Charlie</b></font>)'d laughed more tonight than I'd ever heard in all the time I'd spent with him (<font color='blue'><b>Charlie</b></font>).
<div class="bookquote">``You seem more optimistic than usual,''  (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div>I observed. <div class="bookquote">``I haven't seen you like this before.''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``Isn't it supposed to be like this?''  (<font color='red'><b>He</b></font>)</div>He (<font color='blue'><b>Charlie</b></font>) smiled. <div class="bookquote">``The glory of first love, and all that. It's incredible, isn't it,
the difference between reading about something, seeing it in the pictures, and experiencing it?''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``Very different,''  (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div>I agreed. <div class="bookquote">``More forceful than I'd imagined.''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``For example''   (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div>his (<font color='blue'><b>Charlie</b></font>) words flowed swiftly now, I had to concentrate to catch it all  <div class="bookquote">``the emotion of
jealousy. I've read about it a hundred thousand times, seen actors portray it in a thousand different plays
and movies. I believed I understood that one pretty clearly. But it shocked me''  (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div>He (<font color='blue'><b>Charlie</b></font>) grimaced. <div class="bookquote">``Do you
remember the day that Mike asked you to the dance?''
 (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div>I nodded, though I remembered that day for a different reason. <div class="bookquote">``The day you started talking to me again.''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>``I was surprised by the flare of resentment, almost fury, that I felt  I didn't recognize what it was at
first. I was even more aggravated than usual that I couldn't know what you were thinking, why you
refused him (<font color='blue'><b>Mike</b></font>). Was it simply for your friend's sake? Was there someone else? I knew I had no right to care
either way. I tried not to care.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``And then the line started forming,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Charlie</b></font>) chuckled. I scowled in the darkness.
``I waited, unreasonably anxious to hear what you would say to them, to watch your expressions. I
couldn't deny the relief I felt, watching the annoyance on your face. But I couldn't be sure.
``That was the first night I came here. I wrestled all night, while watching you sleep, with the chasm
between what I knew was right, moral, ethical, and what I wanted. I knew that if I continued to ignore
you as I should, or if I left for a few years, till you were gone, that someday you would say yes to Mike,
or someone like him (<font color='blue'><b>Mike</b></font>). It made me angry.
<div class="bookquote">``And then,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Charlie</b></font>) whispered, <div class="bookquote">``as you were sleeping, you said my name. You spoke so clearly, at first I
thought you'd woken. But you rolled over restlessly and mumbled my name once more, and sighed. The
feeling that coursed through me then was unnerving, staggering. And I knew I couldn't ignore you any
longer.''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>He (<font color='blue'><b>Charlie</b></font>) was silent for a moment, probably listening to the suddenly uneven pounding of my heart.
<div class="bookquote">``But jealousy it's a strange thing. So much more powerful than I would have thought. And irrational!
Just now, when Charlie asked you about that vile Mike Newton''  (<font color='red'><b>He</b></font>)</div>He (<font color='blue'><b>Charlie</b></font>) shook his (<font color='blue'><b>Charlie</b></font>) head angrily.
<div class="bookquote">``I should have known you'd be listening,''  (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div>I groaned.
<div class="bookquote">``Of course.''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``That made you feel jealous, though, really?''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``I'm new at this; you're resurrecting the human in me, and everything feels stronger because it's fresh.''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``But honestly,''  (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div>I teased, <div class="bookquote">``for that to bother you, after I have to hear that Rosalie  Rosalie, the
incarnation of pure beauty, Rosalie  was meant for you. Emmett or no Emmett, how can I compete
with that?''
 (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``There's no competition.''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>His (<font color='blue'><b>Charlie</b></font>) teeth gleamed. He (<font color='blue'><b>Charlie</b></font>) drew my trapped hands around his (<font color='blue'><b>Charlie</b></font>) back, holding me to
his (<font color='blue'><b>Charlie</b></font>) chest. I kept as still as I could, even breathing with caution.
<div class="bookquote">``I know there's no competition,''  (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div>I mumbled into his (<font color='blue'><b>Charlie</b></font>) cold skin. <div class="bookquote">``That's the problem.''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``Of course Rosalie is beautiful in her (<font color='blue'><b>Rosalie</b></font>) way, but even if she (<font color='blue'><b>Rosalie</b></font>) wasn't like a sister to me, even if Emmett didn't
belong with her (<font color='blue'><b>Rosalie</b></font>), she (<font color='blue'><b>Rosalie</b></font>) could never have one tenth, no, one hundredth of the attraction you hold for me.''  (<font color='red'><b>He</b></font>)</div>He (<font color='blue'><b>Charlie</b></font>)
was serious now, thoughtful. <div class="bookquote">``For almost ninety years I've walked among my kind, and yours all the
time thinking I was complete in myself, not realizing what I was seeking. And not finding anything,
because you weren't alive yet.''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``It hardly seems fair,''  (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div>I whispered, my face still resting on his (<font color='blue'><b>Charlie</b></font>) chest, listening to his (<font color='blue'><b>Charlie</b></font>) breath come and go. <div class="bookquote">``I
haven't had to wait at all. Why should I get off so easily?''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``You're right,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Charlie</b></font>) agreed with amusement. <div class="bookquote">``I should make this harder for you, definitely.''  (<font color='red'><b>He</b></font>)</div>He (<font color='blue'><b>Charlie</b></font>) freed one of
his (<font color='blue'><b>Charlie</b></font>) hands, released my wrist, only to gather it carefully into his (<font color='blue'><b>Charlie</b></font>) other hand. He (<font color='blue'><b>Charlie</b></font>) stroked my wet hair softly,
from the top of my head to my waist. <div class="bookquote">``You only have to risk your life every second you spend with me,
that's surely not much. You only have to turn your back on nature, on humanity what's that worth?''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``Very little  I don't feel deprived of anything.''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``Not yet.''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>And his (<font color='blue'><b>Charlie</b></font>) voice was abruptly full of ancient grief.
I tried to pull back, to look in his (<font color='blue'><b>Charlie</b></font>) face, but his (<font color='blue'><b>Charlie</b></font>) hand locked my wrists in an unbreakable hold.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``What ''  (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div>I started to ask, when his (<font color='blue'><b>Charlie</b></font>) body became alert. I froze, but he (<font color='blue'><b>Charlie</b></font>) suddenly released my hands, and
disappeared. I narrowly avoided falling on my face.
<div class="bookquote">``Lie down!''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Charlie</b></font>) hissed. I couldn't tell where he (<font color='blue'><b>Charlie</b></font>) spoke from in the darkness.
I rolled under my quilt, balling up on my side, the way I usually slept. I heard the door crack open, as
Charlie peeked in to make sure I was where I was supposed to be. I breathed evenly, exaggerating the
movement.
A long minute passed. I listened, not sure if I'd heard the door close. Then Edward's cool arm was
around me, under the covers, his (<font color='blue'><b>Edward</b></font>) lips at my ear.
<div class="bookquote">``You are a terrible actress  I'd say that career path is out for you.''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``Darn it,''  (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div>I muttered. My heart was crashing in my chest.
He (<font color='blue'><b>Edward</b></font>) hummed a melody I didn't recognize; it sounded like a lullaby.
He (<font color='blue'><b>Edward</b></font>) paused. <div class="bookquote">``Should I sing you to sleep?''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``Right,''  (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div>I laughed. <div class="bookquote">``Like I could sleep with you here!''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``You do it all the time,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Edward</b></font>) reminded me.
<div class="bookquote">``But I didn't know you were here,''  (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div>I replied icily.
<div class="bookquote">``So if you don't want to sleep''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Edward</b></font>) suggested, ignoring my tone. My breath caught.
<div class="bookquote">``If I don't want to sleep ?''
 (<font color='red'><b>He</b></font>)</div>He (<font color='blue'><b>Edward</b></font>) chuckled. <div class="bookquote">``What do you want to do then?''
 (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div>I couldn't answer at first.
<div class="bookquote">``I'm not sure,''  (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div>I finally said.
<div class="bookquote">``Tell me when you decide.''
 (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div>I could feel his (<font color='blue'><b>Edward</b></font>) cool breath on my neck, feel his (<font color='blue'><b>Edward</b></font>) nose sliding along my jaw, inhaling.
<div class="bookquote">``I thought you were desensitized.''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``Just because I'm resisting the wine doesn't mean I can't appreciate the bouquet,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Edward</b></font>) whispered. <div class="bookquote">``You
have a very floral smell, like lavender or freesia,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Edward</b></font>) noted. <div class="bookquote">``It's mouthwatering.''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``Yeah, it's an off day when I don't get somebody telling me how edible I smell.''
 (<font color='red'><b>He</b></font>)</div>He (<font color='blue'><b>Edward</b></font>) chuckled, and then sighed.
<div class="bookquote">``I've decided what I want to do,''  (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div>I told him (<font color='blue'><b>Edward</b></font>). <div class="bookquote">``I want to hear more about you.''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``Ask me anything.''
 (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div>I sifted through my questions for the most vital. <div class="bookquote">``Why do you do it?''  (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div>I said. <div class="bookquote">``I still don't understand how
you can work so hard to resist what you are. Please don't misunderstand, of course I'm glad that you
do. I just don't see why you would bother in the first place.''

 (<font color='red'><b>He</b></font>)</div><p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Edward</b></font>) hesitated before answering. <div class="bookquote">``That's a good question, and you are not the first one to ask it. The others
 the majority of our kind who are quite content with our lot  they, too, wonder at how we live. But
you see, just because we've been dealt a certain hand it doesn't mean that we can't choose to rise
above  to conquer the boundaries of a destiny that none of us wanted. To try to retain whatever
essential humanity we can.''
 (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div>I lay unmoving, locked in awed silence.
<div class="bookquote">``Did you fall asleep?''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Edward</b></font>) whispered after a few minutes.
<div class="bookquote">``No.''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``Is that all you were curious about?''
 (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div>I rolled my eyes. <div class="bookquote">``Not quite.''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``What else do you want to know?''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``Why can you read minds  why only you? And Alice, seeing the future why does that happen?''
 (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div>I felt him (<font color='blue'><b>Edward</b></font>) shrug in the darkness. <div class="bookquote">``We don't really know. Carlisle has a theory he (<font color='blue'><b>Carlisle</b></font>) believes that we all
bring something of our strongest human traits with us into the next life, where they are intensified  like
our minds, and our senses. He (<font color='blue'><b>Carlisle</b></font>) thinks that I must have already been very sensitive to the thoughts of those
around me. And that Alice had some precognition, wherever she (<font color='blue'><b>Alice</b></font>) was.''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``What did he (<font color='blue'><b>Carlisle</b></font>) bring into the next life, and the others?''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``Carlisle brought his (<font color='blue'><b>Carlisle</b></font>) compassion. Esme brought her (<font color='blue'><b>Alice</b></font>) ability to love passionately. Emmett brought his (<font color='blue'><b>Emmett</b></font>)
strength, Rosalie her (<font color='blue'><b>Rosalie</b></font>) tenacity. Or you could call it pigheadedness.''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Edward</b></font>) chuckled. <div class="bookquote">``Jasper is very
interesting. He (<font color='blue'><b>Jasper</b></font>) was quite charismatic in his (<font color='blue'><b>Jasper</b></font>) first life, able to influence those around him (<font color='blue'><b>Jasper</b></font>) to see things his (<font color='blue'><b>Jasper</b></font>)
way. Now he (<font color='blue'><b>Jasper</b></font>) is able to manipulate the emotions of those around him (<font color='blue'><b>Jasper</b></font>)  calm down a room of angry
people, for example, or excite a lethargic crowd, conversely. It's a very subtle gift.''
 (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div>I considered the impossibilities he (<font color='blue'><b>Edward</b></font>) described, trying to take it in. He (<font color='blue'><b>Edward</b></font>) waited patiently while I thought.
<div class="bookquote">``So where did it all start? I mean, Carlisle changed you, and then someone must have changed him (<font color='blue'><b>Carlisle</b></font>), and
so on''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``Well, where did you come from? Evolution? Creation? Couldn't we have evolved in the same way as
other species, predator and prey? Or, if you don't believe that all this world could have just happened on
its own, which is hard for me to accept myself, is it so hard to believe that the same force that created the
delicate angelfish with the shark, the baby seal and the killer whale, could create both our kinds
together?''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``Let me get this straight  I'm the baby seal, right?''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``Right.''  (<font color='red'><b>He</b></font>)</div>He (<font color='blue'><b>Edward</b></font>) laughed, and something touched my hair  his (<font color='blue'><b>Edward</b></font>) lips?
I wanted to turn toward him (<font color='blue'><b>Edward</b></font>), to see if it was really his (<font color='blue'><b>Edward</b></font>) lips against my hair. But I had to be good; I didn't
want to make this any harder for him (<font color='blue'><b>Edward</b></font>) than it already was.
<div class="bookquote">``Are you ready to sleep?''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Edward</b></font>) asked, interrupting the short silence. <div class="bookquote">``Or do you have any more questions?''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``Only a million or two.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``We have tomorrow, and the next day, and the next''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Edward</b></font>) reminded me. I smiled, euphoric at the
thought.
<div class="bookquote">``Are you sure you won't vanish in the morning?''  (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div>I wanted this to be certain. <div class="bookquote">``You are mythical, after all.''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``I won't leave you.''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>His (<font color='blue'><b>Edward</b></font>) voice had the seal of a promise in it.
<div class="bookquote">``One more, then, tonight''  (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div>And I blushed. The darkness was no help  I'm sure he (<font color='blue'><b>Edward</b></font>) could feel the
sudden warmth under my skin.
<div class="bookquote">``What is it?''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``No, forget it. I changed my mind.''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``Bella, you can ask me anything.''
 (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div>I didn't answer, and he (<font color='blue'><b>Edward</b></font>) groaned.
<div class="bookquote">``I keep thinking it will get less frustrating, not hearing your thoughts. But it just gets worse and worse.''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``I'm glad you can't read my thoughts. It's bad enough that you eavesdrop on my sleep-talking.''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``Please?''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>His (<font color='blue'><b>Edward</b></font>) voice was so persuasive, so impossible to resist.
I shook my head.
<div class="bookquote">``If you don't tell me, I'll just assume it's something much worse than it is,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Edward</b></font>) threatened darkly. <div class="bookquote">``Please?''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>Again, that pleading voice.
<div class="bookquote">``Well,''  (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div>I began, glad that he (<font color='blue'><b>Edward</b></font>) couldn't see my face.
<div class="bookquote">``Yes?''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``You said that Rosalie and Emmett will get married soon Is that marriage the same as it is for
humans?''
 (<font color='red'><b>He</b></font>)</div>He (<font color='blue'><b>Edward</b></font>) laughed in earnest now, understanding. <div class="bookquote">``Is that what you're getting at?''
 (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div>I fidgeted, unable to answer.
<div class="bookquote">``Yes, I suppose it is much the same,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Edward</b></font>) said. <div class="bookquote">``I told you, most of those human desires are there, just
hidden behind more powerful desires.''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``Oh,''  (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div>was all I could say.
<div class="bookquote">``Was there a purpose behind your curiosity?''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``Well, I did wonder about you and me someday''
 (<font color='red'><b>He</b></font>)</div>He (<font color='blue'><b>Edward</b></font>) was instantly serious, I could tell by the sudden stillness of his (<font color='blue'><b>Edward</b></font>) body. I froze, too, reacting
automatically.
<div class="bookquote">``I don't think that that would be possible for us.''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``Because it would be too hard for you, if I were that close?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``That's certainly a problem. But that's not what I was thinking of. It's just that you are so soft, so fragile. I
have to mind my actions every moment that we're together so that I don't hurt you. I could kill you quite
easily, Bella, simply by accident.''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>His (<font color='blue'><b>Edward</b></font>) voice had become just a soft murmur. He (<font color='blue'><b>Edward</b></font>) moved his (<font color='blue'><b>Edward</b></font>) icy palm to
rest it against my cheek. <div class="bookquote">``If I was too hasty if for one second I wasn't paying enough attention, I could
reach out, meaning to touch your face, and crush your skull by mistake. You don't realize how incredibly
breakable you are. I can never, never afford to lose any kind of control when I'm with you.''
 (<font color='red'><b>He</b></font>)</div>He (<font color='blue'><b>Edward</b></font>) waited for me to respond, growing anxious when I didn't. <div class="bookquote">``Are you scared?''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Edward</b></font>) asked.
I waited for a minute to answer, so the words would be true. <div class="bookquote">``No. I'm fine.''
 (<font color='red'><b>He</b></font>)</div>He (<font color='blue'><b>Edward</b></font>) seemed to deliberate for a moment. <div class="bookquote">``I'm curious now, though,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Edward</b></font>) said, his (<font color='blue'><b>Edward</b></font>) voice light again. <div class="bookquote">``Have
you ever ?''  (<font color='red'><b>He</b></font>)</div>He (<font color='blue'><b>Edward</b></font>) trailed off suggestively.
<div class="bookquote">``Of course not.''  (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div>I flushed. <div class="bookquote">``I told you I've never felt like this about anyone before, not even close.''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``I know. It's just that I know other people's thoughts. I know love and lust don't always keep the same
company.''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``They do for me. Now, anyway, that they exist for me at all,''  (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div>I sighed.
<div class="bookquote">``That's nice. We have that one thing in common, at least.''  (<font color='red'><b>He</b></font>)</div>He (<font color='blue'><b>Edward</b></font>) sounded satisfied.
<div class="bookquote">``Your human instincts''  (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div>I began. He (<font color='blue'><b>Edward</b></font>) waited. <div class="bookquote">``Well, do you find me attractive, in that way, at all?''
 (<font color='red'><b>He</b></font>)</div>He (<font color='blue'><b>Edward</b></font>) laughed and lightly rumpled my nearly dry hair.
<div class="bookquote">``I may not be a human, but I am a man,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Edward</b></font>) assured me.
I yawned involuntarily.
<div class="bookquote">``I've answered your questions, now you should sleep,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Edward</b></font>) insisted.
<div class="bookquote">``I'm not sure if I can.''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``Do you want me to leave?''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``No!''  (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div>I said too loudly.
He (<font color='blue'><b>Edward</b></font>) laughed, and then began to hum that same, unfamiliar lullaby; the voice of an archangel, soft in my ear.
More tired than I realized, exhausted from the long day of mental and emotional stress like I'd never felt
before, I drifted to sleep in his (<font color='blue'><b>Edward</b></font>) cold arms.

<p/>15. THE CULLENS

<p/>The muted light of yet another cloudy day eventually woke me. I lay with my arm across my eyes, groggy
and dazed. Something, a dream trying to be remembered, struggled to break into my consciousness. I
moaned and rolled on my side, hoping more sleep would come. And then the previous day flooded back
into my awareness.
<div class="bookquote">``Oh!''  (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div>I sat up so fast it made my head spin.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Your hair looks like a haystack but I like it.''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>His (<font color='blue'><b>Edward</b></font>) unruffled voice came from the rocking chair in the
corner.
<div class="bookquote">``Edward! You stayed!''  (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div>I rejoiced, and thoughtlessly threw myself across the room and into his (<font color='blue'><b>Edward</b></font>) lap. In the
instant that my thoughts caught up with my actions, I froze, shocked by my own uncontrolled enthusiasm.
I stared up at him (<font color='blue'><b>Edward</b></font>), afraid that I had crossed the wrong line.
But he (<font color='blue'><b>Edward</b></font>) laughed.
<div class="bookquote">``Of course,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Edward</b></font>) answered, startled, but seeming pleased by my reaction. His (<font color='blue'><b>Edward</b></font>) hands rubbed my back.
I laid my head cautiously against his (<font color='blue'><b>Edward</b></font>) shoulder, breathing in the smell of his (<font color='blue'><b>Edward</b></font>) skin.
<div class="bookquote">``I was sure it was a dream.''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``You're not that creative,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Edward</b></font>) scoffed.
<div class="bookquote">``Charlie!''  (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div>I remembered, thoughtlessly jumping up again and heading to the door.
<div class="bookquote">``He (<font color='blue'><b>Charlie</b></font>) left an hour ago  after reattaching your battery cables, I might add. I have to admit I was
disappointed. Is that really all it would take to stop you, if you were determined to go?''
 (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div>I deliberated where I stood, wanting to return to him (<font color='blue'><b>Edward</b></font>) badly, but afraid I might have morning breath.
<div class="bookquote">``You're not usually this confused in the morning,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Edward</b></font>) noted. He (<font color='blue'><b>Edward</b></font>) held his (<font color='blue'><b>Edward</b></font>) arms open for me to return. A
nearly irresistible invitation.
<div class="bookquote">``I need another human minute,''  (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div>I admitted.
<div class="bookquote">``I'll wait.''
 (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div>I skipped to the bathroom, my emotions unrecognizable. I didn't know myself, inside or out. The face in
the mirror was practically a stranger  eyes too bright, hectic spots of red across my cheekbones. After
I brushed my teeth, I worked to straighten out the tangled chaos that was my hair. I splashed my face
with cold water, and tried to breathe normally, with no noticeable success. I half-ran back to my room.
It seemed like a miracle that he (<font color='blue'><b>stranger</b></font>) was there, his (<font color='blue'><b>stranger</b></font>) arms still waiting for me. He (<font color='blue'><b>stranger</b></font>) reached out to me, and my
heart thumped unsteadily.
<div class="bookquote">``Welcome back,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>stranger</b></font>) murmured, taking me into his (<font color='blue'><b>stranger</b></font>) arms.
He (<font color='blue'><b>stranger</b></font>) rocked me for a while in silence, until I noticed that his (<font color='blue'><b>stranger</b></font>) clothes were changed, his (<font color='blue'><b>stranger</b></font>) hair smooth.
<div class="bookquote">``You left?''  (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div>I accused, touching the collar of his (<font color='blue'><b>stranger</b></font>) fresh shirt.
<div class="bookquote">``I could hardly leave in the clothes I came in  what would the neighbors think?''
 (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div>I pouted.
<div class="bookquote">``You were very deeply asleep; I didn't miss anything.''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>His (<font color='blue'><b>stranger</b></font>) eyes gleamed. <div class="bookquote">``The talking came earlier.''
 (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div>I groaned. <div class="bookquote">``What did you hear?''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>His (<font color='blue'><b>stranger</b></font>) gold eyes grew very soft. <div class="bookquote">``You said you loved me.''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``You knew that already,''  (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div>I reminded him (<font color='blue'><b>stranger</b></font>), ducking my head.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``It was nice to hear, just the same.''
 (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div>I hid my face against his (<font color='blue'><b>stranger</b></font>) shoulder.
<div class="bookquote">``I love you,''  (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div>I whispered.
<div class="bookquote">``You are my life now,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>stranger</b></font>) answered simply.
There was nothing more to say for the moment. He (<font color='blue'><b>stranger</b></font>) rocked us back and forth as the room grew lighter.
<div class="bookquote">``Breakfast time,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>stranger</b></font>) said eventually, casually  to prove, I'm sure, that he (<font color='blue'><b>stranger</b></font>) remembered all my human
frailties.
So I clutched my throat with both hands and stared at him (<font color='blue'><b>stranger</b></font>) with wide eyes. Shock crossed his (<font color='blue'><b>stranger</b></font>) face.
<div class="bookquote">``Kidding!''  (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div>I snickered. <div class="bookquote">``And you said I couldn't act!''
 (<font color='red'><b>He</b></font>)</div>He (<font color='blue'><b>stranger</b></font>) frowned in disgust. <div class="bookquote">``That wasn't funny.''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``It was very funny, and you know it.''  (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div>But I examined his (<font color='blue'><b>stranger</b></font>) gold eyes carefully, to make sure that I was
forgiven. Apparently, I was.
<div class="bookquote">``Shall I rephrase?''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>stranger</b></font>) asked. <div class="bookquote">``Breakfast time for the human.''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``Oh, okay.''
 (<font color='red'><b>He</b></font>)</div>He (<font color='blue'><b>stranger</b></font>) threw me over his (<font color='blue'><b>stranger</b></font>) stone shoulder, gently, but with a swiftness that left me breathless. I protested as he (<font color='blue'><b>stranger</b></font>)
carried me easily down the stairs, but he (<font color='blue'><b>stranger</b></font>) ignored me. He (<font color='blue'><b>stranger</b></font>) sat me right side up on a chair.
The kitchen was bright, happy, seeming to absorb my mood.
<div class="bookquote">``What's for breakfast?''  (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div>I asked pleasantly.
That threw him (<font color='blue'><b>stranger</b></font>) for a minute.
<div class="bookquote">``Er, I'm not sure. What would you like?''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>His (<font color='blue'><b>stranger</b></font>) marble brow puckered.
I grinned, hopping up.
<div class="bookquote">``That's all right, I fend for myself pretty well. Watch me hunt.''
 (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div>I found a bowl and a box of cereal. I could feel his (<font color='blue'><b>stranger</b></font>) eyes on me as I poured the milk and grabbed a
spoon. I sat my food on the table, and then paused.
<div class="bookquote">``Can I get you anything?''  (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div>I asked, not wanting to be rude.
He (<font color='blue'><b>stranger</b></font>) rolled his (<font color='blue'><b>stranger</b></font>) eyes. <div class="bookquote">``Just eat, Bella.''
 (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div>I sat at the table, watching him (<font color='blue'><b>stranger</b></font>) as I took a bite. He (<font color='blue'><b>stranger</b></font>) was gazing at me, studying my every movement. It
made me self-conscious. I cleared my mouth to speak, to distract him (<font color='blue'><b>stranger</b></font>).
<div class="bookquote">``What's on the agenda for today?''  (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div>I asked.
<div class="bookquote">``Hmmm''  (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div>I watched him (<font color='blue'><b>stranger</b></font>) frame his (<font color='blue'><b>stranger</b></font>) answer carefully. <div class="bookquote">``What would you say to meeting my family?''
 (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div>I gulped.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Are you afraid now?''  (<font color='red'><b>He</b></font>)</div>He (<font color='blue'><b>stranger</b></font>) sounded hopeful.
<div class="bookquote">``Yes,''  (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div>I admitted; how could I deny it  he (<font color='blue'><b>stranger</b></font>) could see my eyes.
<div class="bookquote">``Don't worry.''  (<font color='red'><b>He</b></font>)</div>He (<font color='blue'><b>stranger</b></font>) smirked. <div class="bookquote">``I'll protect you.''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``I'm not afraid of them,''  (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div>I explained. <div class="bookquote">``I'm afraid they won't like me. Won't they be, well, surprised that
you would bring someone like me home to meet them? Do they know that I know about them?''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``Oh, they already know everything. They'd taken bets yesterday, you know''   (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>stranger</b></font>) smiled, but his (<font color='blue'><b>stranger</b></font>) voice
was harsh  <div class="bookquote">``on whether I'd bring you back, though why anyone would bet against Alice, I can't
imagine. At any rate, we don't have secrets in the family. It's not really feasible, what with my mind
reading and Alice seeing the future and all that.''
 (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``And Jasper making you feel all warm and fuzzy about spilling your guts, don't forget that.''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``You paid attention,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>stranger</b></font>) smiled approvingly.
<div class="bookquote">``I've been known to do that every now and then.''  (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div>I grimaced. <div class="bookquote">``So did Alice see me coming?''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>His (<font color='blue'><b>stranger</b></font>) reaction was strange. <div class="bookquote">``Something like that,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>stranger</b></font>) said uncomfortably, turning away so I couldn't see his (<font color='blue'><b>stranger</b></font>)
eyes. I stared at him (<font color='blue'><b>stranger</b></font>) curiously.
<div class="bookquote">``Is that any good?''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>stranger</b></font>) asked, turning back to me abruptly and eyeing my breakfast with a teasing look on
his (<font color='blue'><b>stranger</b></font>) face. <div class="bookquote">``Honestly, it doesn't look very appetizing.''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``Well, it's no irritable grizzly''  (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div>I murmured, ignoring him (<font color='blue'><b>stranger</b></font>) when he (<font color='blue'><b>stranger</b></font>) glowered. I was still wondering why
he (<font color='blue'><b>stranger</b></font>) responded that way when I mentioned Alice. I hurried through my cereal, speculating.
He (<font color='blue'><b>stranger</b></font>) stood in the middle of the kitchen, the statue of Adonis again, staring abstractedly out the back
windows.
Then his (<font color='blue'><b>Adonis</b></font>) eyes were back on me, and he (<font color='blue'><b>Adonis</b></font>) smiled his (<font color='blue'><b>Adonis</b></font>) heartbreaking smile.
<div class="bookquote">``And you should introduce me to your father, too, I think.''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``He (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) already knows you,''  (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div>I reminded him (<font color='blue'><b>Adonis</b></font>).
<div class="bookquote">``As your boyfriend, I mean.''
 (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div>I stared at him (<font color='blue'><b>Adonis</b></font>) with suspicion. <div class="bookquote">``Why?''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``Isn't that customary?''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Adonis</b></font>) asked innocently.
<div class="bookquote">``I don't know,''  (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div>I admitted. My dating history gave me few reference points to work with. Not that any
normal rules of dating applied here. <div class="bookquote">``That's not necessary, you know. I don't expect you to I mean,
you don't have to pretend for me.''
 (<font color='red'><b>smile patient</b></font>)</div>His (<font color='blue'><b>Adonis</b></font>) smile was patient. <div class="bookquote">``I'm not pretending.''
 (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div>I pushed the remains of my cereal around the edges of the bowl, biting my lip.
<div class="bookquote">``Are you going to tell Charlie I'm your boyfriend or not?''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>lip</b></font>) demanded.
<div class="bookquote">``Is that what you are?''  (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div>I suppressed my internal cringing at the thought of Edward and Charlie and the
word boy friend all in the same room at the same time.

<p/>``It's a loose interpretation of the word ``boy,<div class="bookquote">'' I'll admit.''
 (<font color='red'><b>the word boy</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``I was under the impression that you were something more, actually,''  (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div>I confessed, looking at the table.
<div class="bookquote">``Well, I don't know if we need to give him (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>) all the gory details.''  (<font color='red'><b>He</b></font>)</div>He (<font color='blue'><b>Charlie</b></font>) reached across the table to lift my chin
with a cold, gentle finger. <div class="bookquote">``But he (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>) will need some explanation for why I'm around here so much. I don't
want Chief Swan getting a restraining order put on me.''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``Will you be?''  (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div>I asked, suddenly anxious. <div class="bookquote">``Will you really be here?''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``As long as you want me,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Charlie</b></font>) assured me.
<div class="bookquote">``I'll always want you,''  (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div>I warned him (<font color='blue'><b>Charlie</b></font>). <div class="bookquote">``Forever.''
 (<font color='red'><b>He</b></font>)</div>He (<font color='blue'><b>Charlie</b></font>) walked slowly around the table, and, pausing a few feet away, he (<font color='blue'><b>Charlie</b></font>) reached out to touch his (<font color='blue'><b>Charlie</b></font>) fingertips
to my cheek. His (<font color='blue'><b>Charlie</b></font>) expression was unfathomable.
<div class="bookquote">``Does that make you sad?''  (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div>I asked.
He (<font color='blue'><b>Charlie</b></font>) didn't answer. He (<font color='blue'><b>Charlie</b></font>) stared into my eyes for an immeasurable period of time.
<div class="bookquote">``Are you finished?''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Charlie</b></font>) finally asked.
I jumped up. <div class="bookquote">``Yes.''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``Get dressed  I'll wait here.''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>It was hard to decide what to wear. I doubted there were any etiquette books detailing how to dress
when your vampire sweetheart takes you home to meet his (<font color='blue'><b>vampire</b></font>) vampire family. It was a relief to think the
word to myself. I knew I shied away from it intentionally.
I ended up in my only skirt  long, khaki-colored, still casual. I put on the dark blue blouse he (<font color='blue'><b>vampire</b></font>)'d once
complimented. A quick glance in the mirror told me my hair was entirely impossible, so I pulled it back
into a pony tail.
<div class="bookquote">``Okay.''  (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div>I bounced down the stairs. <div class="bookquote">``I'm decent.''
 (<font color='red'><b>He</b></font>)</div>He (<font color='blue'><b>vampire</b></font>) was waiting at the foot of the stairs, closer than I'd thought, and I bounded right into him (<font color='blue'><b>vampire</b></font>). He (<font color='blue'><b>vampire</b></font>) steadied
me, holding me a careful distance away for a few seconds before suddenly pulling me closer.
<div class="bookquote">``Wrong again,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>vampire</b></font>) murmured in my ear. <div class="bookquote">``You are utterly indecent  no one should look so tempting, it's
not fair.''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``Tempting how?''  (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div>I asked. <div class="bookquote">``I can change''
 (<font color='red'><b>He</b></font>)</div>He (<font color='blue'><b>vampire</b></font>) sighed, shaking his (<font color='blue'><b>vampire</b></font>) head. <div class="bookquote">``You are so absurd.''  (<font color='red'><b>He</b></font>)</div>He (<font color='blue'><b>vampire</b></font>) pressed his (<font color='blue'><b>vampire</b></font>) cool lips delicately to my forehead,
and the room spun. The smell of his (<font color='blue'><b>vampire</b></font>) breath made it impossible to think.
<div class="bookquote">``Shall I explain how you are tempting me?''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>vampire</b></font>) said. It was clearly a rhetorical question. His (<font color='blue'><b>vampire</b></font>) fingers traced
slowly down my spine, his (<font color='blue'><b>vampire</b></font>) breath coming more quickly against my skin. My hands were limp on his (<font color='blue'><b>vampire</b></font>)
chest, and I felt lightheaded again. He (<font color='blue'><b>vampire</b></font>) tilted his (<font color='blue'><b>vampire</b></font>) head slowly and touched his (<font color='blue'><b>vampire</b></font>) cool lips to mine for the
second time, very carefully, parting them slightly.
And then I collapsed.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Bella?''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>His (<font color='blue'><b>vampire</b></font>) voice was alarmed as he (<font color='blue'><b>vampire</b></font>) caught me and held me up.
<div class="bookquote">``You made me faint,''  (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div>I accused him (<font color='blue'><b>vampire</b></font>) dizzily.
<div class="bookquote">``What am I going to do with you?''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>vampire</b></font>) groaned in exasperation. <div class="bookquote">``Yesterday I kiss you, and you attack
me! Today you pass out on me!''
 (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div>I laughed weakly, letting his (<font color='blue'><b>vampire</b></font>) arms support me while my head spun.
<div class="bookquote">``So much for being good at everything,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>vampire</b></font>) sighed.
<div class="bookquote">``That's the problem.''  (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div>I was still dizzy. <div class="bookquote">``You're too good. Far, far too good.''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``Do you feel sick?''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>vampire</b></font>) asked; he (<font color='blue'><b>vampire</b></font>)'d seen me like this before.
<div class="bookquote">``No  that wasn't the same kind of fainting at all. I don't know what happened.''  (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div>I shook my head
apologeticallv, <div class="bookquote">``I think I forgot to breathe.''
 (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``I can't take you anywhere like this.''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``I'm fine,''  (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div>I insisted. <div class="bookquote">``Your family is going to think I'm insane anyway, what's the difference?''
 (<font color='red'><b>He</b></font>)</div>He (<font color='blue'><b>vampire</b></font>) measured my expression for a moment. <div class="bookquote">``I'm very partial to that color with your skin,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>vampire</b></font>) offered
unexpectedly. I flushed with pleasure, and looked away.
<div class="bookquote">``Look, I'm trying really hard not to think about what I'm about to do, so can we go already?''  (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div>I asked.
<div class="bookquote">``And you're worried, not because you're headed to meet a houseful of vampires, but because you think
those vampires won't approve of you, correct?''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``That's right,''  (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div>I answered immediately, hiding my surprise at his (<font color='blue'><b>vampire</b></font>) casual use of the word.
He (<font color='blue'><b>vampire</b></font>) shook his (<font color='blue'><b>vampire</b></font>) head. <div class="bookquote">``You're incredible.''
 (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div>I realized, as he (<font color='blue'><b>vampire</b></font>) drove my truck out of the main part of town, that I had no idea where he (<font color='blue'><b>vampire</b></font>) lived. We
passed over the bridge at the Calawah River, the road winding northward, the houses flashing past us
growing farther apart, getting bigger. And then we were past the other houses altogether, driving through
misty forest. I was trying to decide whether to ask or be patient, when he (<font color='blue'><b>patient</b></font>) turned abruptly onto an
unpaved road. It was unmarked, barely visible among the ferns. The forest encroached on both sides,
leaving the road ahead only discernible for a few meters as it twisted, serpentlike, around the ancient
trees.
And then, after a few miles, there was some thinning of the woods, and we were suddenly in a small
meadow, or was it actually a lawn? The gloom of the forest didn't relent, though, for there were six
primordial cedars that shaded an entire acre with their vast sweep of branches. The trees held their
protecting shadow right up to the walls of the house that rose among them, making obsolete the deep
porch that wrapped around the first story.
I don't know what I had expected, but it definitely wasn't this. The house was timeless, graceful, and
probably a hundred years old. It was painted a soft, faded white, three stories tall, rectangular and well
proportioned. The windows and doors were either part of the original structure or a perfect restoration.
My truck was the only car in sight. I could hear the river close by, hidden in the obscurity of the forest.
<div class="bookquote">``Wow.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``You like it?''  (<font color='red'><b>He</b></font>)</div>He (<font color='blue'><b>I</b></font>) smiled.
<div class="bookquote">``It has a certain charm.''
 (<font color='red'><b>He</b></font>)</div>He (<font color='blue'><b>I</b></font>) pulled the end of my ponytail and chuckled.
<div class="bookquote">``Ready?''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>I</b></font>) asked, opening my door.
<div class="bookquote">``Not even a little bit  let's go.''  (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div>I tried to laugh, but it seemed to get stuck in my throat. I smoothed my
hair nervously.
<div class="bookquote">``You look lovely.''  (<font color='red'><b>He</b></font>)</div>He (<font color='blue'><b>I</b></font>) took my hand easily, without thinking about it.
We walked through the deep shade up to the porch. I knew he (<font color='blue'><b>I</b></font>) could feel my tension; his (<font color='blue'><b>I</b></font>) thumb rubbed
soothing circles into the back of my hand.
He (<font color='blue'><b>I</b></font>) opened the door for me.
The inside was even more surprising, less predictable, than the exterior. It was very bright, very open,
and very large. This must have originally been several rooms, but the walls had been removed from most
of the first floor to create one wide space. The back, south-facing wall had been entirely replaced with
glass, and, beyond the shade of the cedars, the lawn stretched bare to the wide river. A massive curving
staircase dominated the west side of the room. The walls, the high-beamed ceiling, the wooden floors,
and the thick carpets were all varying shades of white.
Waiting to greet us, standing just to the left of the door, on a raised portion of the floor by a spectacular
grand piano, were Edward's parents.
I'd seen Dr. Cullen before, of course, yet I couldn't help but be struck again by his (<font color='blue'><b>Cullen</b></font>) youth, his (<font color='blue'><b>Cullen</b></font>) outrageous
perfection. At his (<font color='blue'><b>Cullen</b></font>) side was Esme, I assumed, the only one of the family I'd never seen before. She (<font color='blue'><b>Cullen</b></font>) had
the same pale, beautiful features as the rest of them. Something about her (<font color='blue'><b>Cullen</b></font>) heart-shaped face, her (<font color='blue'><b>Cullen</b></font>) billows
of soft, caramel-colored hair, reminded me of the ingnues of the silent-movie era. She (<font color='blue'><b>Cullen</b></font>) was small,
slender, yet less angular, more rounded than the others. They were both dressed casually, in light colors
that matched the inside of the house. They smiled in welcome, but made no move to approach us. Trying
not to frighten me, I guessed.
<div class="bookquote">``Carlisle, Esme,''  (<font color='red'><b>Edward/Edward Cullen/Cullen</b></font>)</div>Edward's voice broke the short silence, <div class="bookquote">``this is Bella.''
 (<font color='red'><b>Edward/Edward Cullen/Cullen</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``You're very welcome, Bella.''  (<font color='red'><b>Carlisle</b></font>)</div>Carlisle's step was measured, careful as he (<font color='blue'><b>Carlisle</b></font>) approached me. He (<font color='blue'><b>Carlisle</b></font>) raised his (<font color='blue'><b>Carlisle</b></font>)
hand tentatively, and I stepped forward to shake hands with him (<font color='blue'><b>Carlisle</b></font>).
<div class="bookquote">``It's nice to see you again, Dr. Cullen.''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``Please, call me Carlisle.''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``Carlisle.''  (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div>I grinned at him (<font color='blue'><b>Carlisle</b></font>), my sudden confidence surprising me. I could feel Edward's relief at my side.
Esme smiled and stepped forward as well, reaching for my hand. Her (<font color='blue'><b>Carlisle</b></font>) cold, stone grasp was just as I
expected.
<div class="bookquote">``It's very nice to know you,''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Carlisle</b></font>) said sincerely.
<div class="bookquote">``Thank you. I'm glad to meet you, too.''  (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div>And I was. It was like meeting a fairy tale  Snow White, in the
flesh.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Where are Alice and Jasper?''  (<font color='red'><b>Edward/Edward Cullen/Cullen</b></font>)</div>Edward asked, but no one answered, as they had just appeared at the
top of the wide staircase.
<div class="bookquote">``Hey, Edward!''  (<font color='red'><b>Alice</b></font>)</div>Alice called enthusiastically. She (<font color='blue'><b>Alice</b></font>) ran down the stairs, a streak of black hair and white
skin, coming to a sudden and graceful stop in front of me. Carlisle and Esme shot warning glances at her (<font color='blue'><b>Alice</b></font>),
but I liked it. It was natural  for her (<font color='blue'><b>Alice</b></font>), anyway.
<div class="bookquote">``Hi, Bella!''  (<font color='red'><b>Alice</b></font>)</div>Alice said, and she (<font color='blue'><b>Alice</b></font>) bounced forward to kiss my cheek. If Carlisle and Esme had looked
cautious before, they now looked staggered. There was shock in my eyes, too, but I was also very
pleased that she (<font color='blue'><b>Alice</b></font>) seemed to approve of me so entirely. I was startled to feel Edward stiffen at my side. I
glanced at his (<font color='blue'><b>Edward</b></font>) face, but his (<font color='blue'><b>Edward</b></font>) expression was unreadable.
<div class="bookquote">``You do smell nice, I never noticed before,''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Alice</b></font>) commented, to my extreme embarrassment.
No one else seemed to know quite what to say, and then Jasper was there  tall and leonine. A feeling
of ease spread through me, and I was suddenly comfortable despite where I was. Edward stared at
Jasper, raising one eyebrow, and I remembered what Jasper could do.
<div class="bookquote">``Hello, Bella,''  (<font color='red'><b>Jasper</b></font>)</div>Jasper said. He (<font color='blue'><b>Jasper</b></font>) kept his (<font color='blue'><b>Jasper</b></font>) distance, not offering to shake my hand. But it was impossible to
feel awkward near him (<font color='blue'><b>Jasper</b></font>).
<div class="bookquote">``Hello, Jasper.''  (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div>I smiled at him (<font color='blue'><b>Jasper</b></font>) shyly, and then at the others. <div class="bookquote">``It's nice to meet you all  you have a very
beautiful home,''  (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div>I added conventionally.
<div class="bookquote">``Thank you,''  (<font color='red'><b>Esme</b></font>)</div>Esme said. <div class="bookquote">``We're so glad that you came.''  (<font color='red'><b>She</b></font>)</div>She (<font color='blue'><b>others</b></font>) spoke with feeling, and I realized that she (<font color='blue'><b>others</b></font>)
thought I was brave.
I also realized that Rosalie and Emmett were nowhere to be seen, and I remembered Edward's
too-innocent denial when I'd asked him (<font color='blue'><b>Edward</b></font>) if the others didn't like me.
Carlisle's expression distracted me from this train of thought; he (<font color='blue'><b>Carlisle</b></font>) was gazing meaningfully at Edward with
an intense expression. Out of the corner of my eye, I saw Edward nod once.
I looked away, trying to be polite. My eyes wandered again to the beautiful instrument on the platform by
the door. I suddenly remembered my childhood fantasy that, should I ever win a lottery, I would buy a
grand piano for my mother. She (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) wasn't really good  she (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) only played for herself on our secondhand
upright  but I loved to watch her (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) play. She (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) was happy, absorbed  she (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) seemed like a new,
mysterious being to me then, someone outside the <div class="bookquote">``mom''  (<font color='red'><b>someone</b></font>)</div>persona I took for granted. She (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>)'d put me
through lessons, of course, but like most kids, I whined until she (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) let me quit.
Esme noticed my preoccupation.
<div class="bookquote">``Do you play?''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) asked, inclining her (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) head toward the piano.
I shook my head. <div class="bookquote">``Not at all. But it's so beautiful. Is it yours?''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``No,''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) laughed. <div class="bookquote">``Edward didn't tell you he (<font color='blue'><b>Edward</b></font>) was musical?''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``No.''  (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div>I glared at his (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) suddenly innocent expression with narrowed eyes. <div class="bookquote">``I should have known, I guess.''
 (<font color='red'><b>Esme</b></font>)</div>Esme raised her (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) delicate eyebrows in confusion.
<div class="bookquote">``Edward can do everything, right?''  (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div>I explained.
Jasper snickered and Esme gave Edward a reproving look.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``I hope you haven't been showing off it's rude,''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) scolded.
<div class="bookquote">``Just a bit,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Edward</b></font>) laughed freely. Her (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) face softened at the sound, and they shared a brief look that I didn't
understand, though Esme's face seemed almost smug.
<div class="bookquote">``He (<font color='blue'><b>Edward</b></font>)'s been too modest, actually,''  (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div>I corrected.
<div class="bookquote">``Well, play for her (<font color='blue'><b>mom</b></font>),''  (<font color='red'><b>Esme</b></font>)</div>Esme encouraged.
<div class="bookquote">``You just said showing off was rude,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Edward</b></font>) objected.
<div class="bookquote">``There are exceptions to every rule,''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) replied.
<div class="bookquote">``I'd like to hear you play,''  (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div>I volunteered.
<div class="bookquote">``It's settled then.''  (<font color='red'><b>Esme</b></font>)</div>Esme pushed him (<font color='blue'><b>Edward</b></font>) toward the piano. He (<font color='blue'><b>Edward</b></font>) pulled me along, sitting me on the bench beside
him (<font color='blue'><b>Edward</b></font>).
He (<font color='blue'><b>Edward</b></font>) gave me a long, exasperated look before he (<font color='blue'><b>Edward</b></font>) turned to the keys.
And then his (<font color='blue'><b>Edward</b></font>) fingers flowed swiftly across the ivory, and the room was filled with a composition so
complex, so luxuriant, it was impossible to believe only one set of hands played. I felt my chin drop, my
mouth open in astonishment, and heard low chuckles behind me at my reaction.
Edward looked at me casually, the music still surging around us without a break, and winked. <div class="bookquote">``Do you
like it?''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``You wrote this?''  (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div>I gasped, understanding.
He (<font color='blue'><b>Edward</b></font>) nodded. <div class="bookquote">``It's Esme's favorite.''
 (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div>I closed my eyes, shaking my head.
<div class="bookquote">``What's wrong?''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``I'm feeling extremely insignificant.''
 (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div>The music slowed, transforming into something softer, and to my surprise I detected the melody of his (<font color='blue'><b>Edward</b></font>)
lullaby weaving through the profusion of notes.
<div class="bookquote">``You inspired this one,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Edward</b></font>) said softly. The music grew unbearably sweet.
I couldn't speak.
<div class="bookquote">``They like you, you know,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Edward</b></font>) said conversationally. <div class="bookquote">``Esme especially.''
 (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div>I glanced behind me, but the huge room was empty now.
<div class="bookquote">``Where did they go?''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``Very subtly giving us some privacy, I suppose.''
 (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div>I sighed. <div class="bookquote">``They like me. But Rosalie and Emmett''  (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div>I trailed off, not sure how to express my doubts.
He (<font color='blue'><b>Edward</b></font>) frowned. <div class="bookquote">``Don't worry about Rosalie,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Edward</b></font>) said, his (<font color='blue'><b>Edward</b></font>) eyes wide and persuasive. <div class="bookquote">``She (<font color='blue'><b>Rosalie</b></font>)'ll come around.''

 (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div><p/>I pursed my lips skeptically. <div class="bookquote">``Emmett?''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``Well, he (<font color='blue'><b>Emmett</b></font>) thinks I'm a lunatic, it's true, but he (<font color='blue'><b>Emmett</b></font>) doesn't have a problem with you. He (<font color='blue'><b>Emmett</b></font>)'s trying to reason with
Rosalie.''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``What is it that upsets her (<font color='blue'><b>Rosalie</b></font>)?''  (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div>I wasn't sure if I wanted to know the answer.
He (<font color='blue'><b>Edward</b></font>) sighed deeply. <div class="bookquote">``Rosalie struggles the most with with what we are. It's hard for her (<font color='blue'><b>Rosalie</b></font>) to have someone
on the outside know the truth. And she (<font color='blue'><b>Rosalie</b></font>)'s a little jealous.''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``Rosalie is jealous of me?''  (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div>I asked incredulously. I tried to imagine a universe in which someone as
breathtaking as Rosalie would have any possible reason to feel jealous of someone like me.
<div class="bookquote">``You're human.''  (<font color='red'><b>He</b></font>)</div>He (<font color='blue'><b>Edward</b></font>) shrugged. <div class="bookquote">``She (<font color='blue'><b>Rosalie</b></font>) wishes that she (<font color='blue'><b>Rosalie</b></font>) were, too.''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``Oh,''  (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div>I muttered, still stunned. <div class="bookquote">``Even Jasper, though''
 (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``That's really my fault,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Edward</b></font>) said. <div class="bookquote">``I told you he (<font color='blue'><b>Jasper</b></font>) was the most recent to try our way of life. I warned him (<font color='blue'><b>Jasper</b></font>) to
keep his (<font color='blue'><b>Jasper</b></font>) distance.''
 (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div>I thought about the reason for that, and shuddered.
<div class="bookquote">``Esme and Carlisle ?''  (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div>I continued quickly, to keep him (<font color='blue'><b>Edward</b></font>) from noticing.
<div class="bookquote">``Are happy to see me happy. Actually, Esme wouldn't care if you had a third eye and webbed feet. All
this time she (<font color='blue'><b>Rosalie</b></font>)'s been worried about me, afraid that there was something missing from my essential makeup,
that I was too young when Carlisle changed me She (<font color='blue'><b>Rosalie</b></font>)'s ecstatic. Every time I touch you, she (<font color='blue'><b>Rosalie</b></font>) just about
chokes with satisfaction.''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``Alice seems very enthusiastic.''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``Alice has her (<font color='blue'><b>Alice</b></font>) own way of looking at things,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Edward</b></font>) said through tight lips.
<div class="bookquote">``And you're not going to explain that, are you?''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>A moment of wordless communication passed between us. He (<font color='blue'><b>Edward</b></font>) realized that I knew he (<font color='blue'><b>Edward</b></font>) was keeping
something from me. I realized that he (<font color='blue'><b>Edward</b></font>) wasn't going to give anything away. Not now.
<div class="bookquote">``So what was Carlisle telling you before?''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>His (<font color='blue'><b>Edward</b></font>) eyebrows pulled together. <div class="bookquote">``You noticed that, did you?''
 (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div>I shrugged. <div class="bookquote">``Of course.''
 (<font color='red'><b>He</b></font>)</div>He (<font color='blue'><b>Edward</b></font>) looked at me thoughtfully for a few seconds before answering. <div class="bookquote">``He (<font color='blue'><b>Carlisle</b></font>) wanted to tell me some news 
he (<font color='blue'><b>Carlisle</b></font>) didn't know if it was something I would share with you.''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``Will you?''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``I have to, because I'm going to be a little overbearingly protective over the next few days  or
weeks  and I wouldn't want you to think I'm naturally a tyrant.''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``What's wrong?''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``Nothing's wrong, exactly. Alice just sees some visitors coming soon. They know we're here, and they're
curious.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Visitors?''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``Yes well, they aren't like us, of course  in their hunting habits, I mean. They probably won't come
into town at all, but I'm certainly not going to let you out of my sight till they're gone.''
 (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div>I shivered.
<div class="bookquote">``Finally, a rational response!''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Edward</b></font>) murmured. <div class="bookquote">``I was beginning to think you had no sense of
self-preservation at all.''
 (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div>I let that one pass, looking away, my eyes wandering again around the spacious room.
He (<font color='blue'><b>Edward</b></font>) followed my gaze. <div class="bookquote">``Not what you expected, is it?''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Edward</b></font>) asked, his (<font color='blue'><b>Edward</b></font>) voice smug.
<div class="bookquote">``No,''  (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div>I admitted.
<div class="bookquote">``No coffins, no piled skulls in the corners; I don't even think we have cobwebs what a disappointment
this must be for you,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Edward</b></font>) continued slyly.
I ignored his (<font color='blue'><b>Edward</b></font>) teasing. <div class="bookquote">``It's so light so open.''
 (<font color='red'><b>He</b></font>)</div>He (<font color='blue'><b>Edward</b></font>) was more serious when he (<font color='blue'><b>Edward</b></font>) answered. <div class="bookquote">``It's the one place we never have to hide.''
 (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>The song he (<font color='blue'><b>Edward</b></font>) was still playing, my song, drifted to an end, the final chords shifting to a more melancholy
key. The last note hovered poignantly in the silence.
<div class="bookquote">``Thank you,''  (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div>I murmured. I realized there were tears in my eyes. I dabbed at them, embarrassed.
He (<font color='blue'><b>Edward</b></font>) touched the corner of my eye, trapping one I missed. He (<font color='blue'><b>Edward</b></font>) lifted his (<font color='blue'><b>Edward</b></font>) finger, examining the drop of
moisture broodingly. Then, so quickly I couldn't be positive that he (<font color='blue'><b>Edward</b></font>) really did, he (<font color='blue'><b>Edward</b></font>) put his (<font color='blue'><b>Edward</b></font>) finger to his (<font color='blue'><b>Edward</b></font>)
mouth to taste it.
I looked at him (<font color='blue'><b>Edward</b></font>) questioningly, and he (<font color='blue'><b>Edward</b></font>) gazed back for a long moment before he (<font color='blue'><b>Edward</b></font>) finally smiled.
<div class="bookquote">``Do you want to see the rest of the house?''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``No coffins?''  (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div>I verified, the sarcasm in my voice not entirely masking the slight but genuine anxiety I felt.
He (<font color='blue'><b>Edward</b></font>) laughed, taking my hand, leading me away from the piano.
<div class="bookquote">``No coffins,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Edward</b></font>) promised.
We walked up the massive staircase, my hand trailing along the satin-smooth rail. The long hall at the top
of the stairs was paneled with a honey-colored wood, the same as the floorboards.
<div class="bookquote">``Rosalie and Emmett's room Carlisle's office Alice's room''  (<font color='red'><b>He</b></font>)</div>He (<font color='blue'><b>Edward</b></font>) gestured as he (<font color='blue'><b>Edward</b></font>) led me past the
doors.
He (<font color='blue'><b>Edward</b></font>) would have continued, but I stopped dead at the end of the hall, staring incredulously at the ornament
hanging on the wall above my head. Edward chuckled at my bewildered expression.
<div class="bookquote">``You can laugh,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Edward</b></font>) said. <div class="bookquote">``It is sort of ironic.''
 (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div>I didn't laugh. My hand raised automatically, one finger extended as if to touch the large wooden cross,
its dark patina contrasting with the lighter tone of the wall. I didn't touch it, though I was curious if the
aged wood would feel as silky as it looked.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``It must be very old,''  (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div>I guessed.
He (<font color='blue'><b>Edward</b></font>) shrugged. <div class="bookquote">``Early sixteen-thirties, more or less.''
 (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div>I looked away from the cross to stare at him (<font color='blue'><b>Edward</b></font>).
<div class="bookquote">``Why do you keep this here?''  (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div>I wondered.
<div class="bookquote">``Nostalgia. It belonged to Carlisle's father.''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``He (<font color='blue'><b>Carlisle</b></font>) collected antiques?''  (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div>I suggested doubtfully.
<div class="bookquote">``No. He (<font color='blue'><b>Carlisle</b></font>) carved this himself. It hung on the wall above the pulpit in the vicarage where he (<font color='blue'><b>Carlisle</b></font>) preached.''
 (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div>I wasn't sure if my face betrayed my shock, but I returned to gazing at the simple, ancient cross, just in
case. I quickly did the mental math; the cross was over three hundred and seventy years old. The silence
stretched on as I struggled to wrap my mind around the concept of so many years.
<div class="bookquote">``Are you all right?''  (<font color='red'><b>He</b></font>)</div>He (<font color='blue'><b>Edward</b></font>) sounded worried.
<div class="bookquote">``How old is Carlisle?''  (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div>I asked quietly, ignoring his (<font color='blue'><b>Edward</b></font>) question, still staring up.
<div class="bookquote">``He (<font color='blue'><b>Carlisle</b></font>) just celebrated his (<font color='blue'><b>Carlisle</b></font>) three hundred and sixty-second birthday,''  (<font color='red'><b>Edward/Edward Cullen/Cullen</b></font>)</div>Edward said. I looked back at him (<font color='blue'><b>Edward</b></font>), a
million questions in my eyes.
He (<font color='blue'><b>Edward</b></font>) watched me carefully as he (<font color='blue'><b>Edward</b></font>) spoke.
<div class="bookquote">``Carlisle was born in London, in the sixteen-forties, he (<font color='blue'><b>Carlisle</b></font>) believes. Time wasn't marked as accurately then,
for the common people anyway. It was just before Cromwell's rule, though.''
 (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div>I kept my face composed, aware of his (<font color='blue'><b>Edward</b></font>) scrutiny as I listened. It was easier if I didn't try to believe.
<div class="bookquote">``He (<font color='blue'><b>Carlisle</b></font>) was the only son of an Anglican pastor. His (<font color='blue'><b>Carlisle</b></font>) mother died giving birth to him (<font color='blue'><b>Carlisle</b></font>). His (<font color='blue'><b>Carlisle</b></font>) father was an
intolerant man. As the Protestants came into power, he (<font color='blue'><b>Carlisle</b></font>) was enthusiastic in his (<font color='blue'><b>Carlisle</b></font>) persecution of Roman
Catholics and other religions. He (<font color='blue'><b>Carlisle</b></font>) also believed very strongly in the reality of evil. He (<font color='blue'><b>Carlisle</b></font>) led hunts for
witches, werewolves and vampires.''  (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div>I grew very still at the word. I'm sure he (<font color='blue'><b>Edward</b></font>) noticed, but he (<font color='blue'><b>Edward</b></font>) went on
without pausing.
``They burned a lot of innocent people  of course the real creatures that he (<font color='blue'><b>Carlisle</b></font>) sought were not so easy to
catch.
``When the pastor grew old, he (<font color='blue'><b>pastor</b></font>) placed his (<font color='blue'><b>pastor</b></font>) obedient son in charge of the raids. At first Carlisle was a
disappointment; he (<font color='blue'><b>Carlisle</b></font>) was not quick to accuse, to see demons where they did not exist. But he (<font color='blue'><b>Carlisle</b></font>) was
persistent, and more clever than his (<font color='blue'><b>Carlisle</b></font>) father. He (<font color='blue'><b>Carlisle</b></font>) actually discovered a coven of true vampires that lived
hidden in the sewers of the city, only coming out by night to hunt. In those days, when monsters were not
just myths and legends, that was the way many lived.
<div class="bookquote">``The people gathered their pitchforks and torches, of course''   (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>his (<font color='blue'><b>Edward</b></font>) brief laugh was darker now  <div class="bookquote">``and
waited where Carlisle had seen the monsters exit into the street. Eventually one emerged.''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>His (<font color='blue'><b>Edward</b></font>) voice was very quiet; I strained to catch the words.
``He (<font color='blue'><b>Carlisle</b></font>) must have been ancient, and weak with hunger. Carlisle heard him (<font color='blue'><b>Carlisle</b></font>) call out in Latin to the others
when he (<font color='blue'><b>Carlisle</b></font>) caught the scent of the mob. He (<font color='blue'><b>Carlisle</b></font>) ran through the streets, and Carlisle  he (<font color='blue'><b>Carlisle</b></font>) was twenty-three
and very fast  was in the lead of the pursuit. The creature could have easily outrun them, but Carlisle

<p/>thinks he (<font color='blue'><b>Carlisle</b></font>) was too hungry, so he (<font color='blue'><b>Carlisle</b></font>) turned and attacked. He (<font color='blue'><b>Carlisle</b></font>) fell on Carlisle first, but the others were close
behind, and he (<font color='blue'><b>Carlisle</b></font>) turned to defend himself. He (<font color='blue'><b>Carlisle</b></font>) killed two men, and made off with a third, leaving Carlisle
bleeding in the street.''
He (<font color='blue'><b>Edward</b></font>) paused. I could sense he (<font color='blue'><b>Edward</b></font>) was editing something, keeping something from me.
``Carlisle knew what his (<font color='blue'><b>Carlisle</b></font>) father would do. The bodies would be burned  anything infected by the
monster must be destroyed. Carlisle acted instinctively to save his (<font color='blue'><b>Carlisle</b></font>) own life. He (<font color='blue'><b>Carlisle</b></font>) crawled away from the
alley while the mob followed the fiend and his (<font color='blue'><b>Carlisle</b></font>) victim. He (<font color='blue'><b>Carlisle</b></font>) hid in a cellar, buried himself in rotting potatoes
for three days. It's a miracle he (<font color='blue'><b>Carlisle</b></font>) was able to keep silent, to stay undiscovered.
<div class="bookquote">``It was over then, and he (<font color='blue'><b>Carlisle</b></font>) realized what he (<font color='blue'><b>Carlisle</b></font>) had become.''
 (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div>I'm not sure what my face was revealing, but he (<font color='blue'><b>Edward</b></font>) suddenly broke off.
<div class="bookquote">``How are you feeling?''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Edward</b></font>) asked.
<div class="bookquote">``I'm fine,''  (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div>I assured him (<font color='blue'><b>Edward</b></font>). And, though I bit my lip in hesitation, he (<font color='blue'><b>Edward</b></font>) must have seen the curiosity burning in
my eyes.
He (<font color='blue'><b>Edward</b></font>) smiled. <div class="bookquote">``I expect you have a few more questions for me.''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``A few.''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>His (<font color='blue'><b>Edward</b></font>) smile widened over his (<font color='blue'><b>Edward</b></font>) brilliant teeth. He (<font color='blue'><b>Edward</b></font>) started back down the hall, pulling me along by the hand.
<div class="bookquote">``Come on, then,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Edward</b></font>) encouraged. <div class="bookquote">``I'll show you.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/>16. CARLISLE

<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Edward</b></font>) led me back to the room that he (<font color='blue'><b>Edward</b></font>)'d pointed out as Carlisle's office. He (<font color='blue'><b>Carlisle</b></font>) paused outside the door for an
instant.
<div class="bookquote">``Come in,''  (<font color='red'><b>Carlisle</b></font>)</div>Carlisle's voice invited.
Edward opened the door to a high-ceilinged room with tall, west-facing windows. The walls were
paneled again, in a darker wood  where they were visible. Most of the wall space was taken up by
towering bookshelves that reached high above my head and held more books than I'd ever seen outside
a library.
Carlisle sat behind a huge mahogany desk in a leather chair. He (<font color='blue'><b>Carlisle</b></font>) was just placing a bookmark in the pages
of the thick volume he (<font color='blue'><b>Carlisle</b></font>) held. The room was how I'd always imagined a college dean's would look  only
Carlisle looked too young to fit the part.
<div class="bookquote">``What can I do for you?''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Carlisle</b></font>) asked us pleasantly, rising from his (<font color='blue'><b>Carlisle</b></font>) seat.
<div class="bookquote">``I wanted to show Bella some of our history,''  (<font color='red'><b>Edward/Edward Cullen/Cullen</b></font>)</div>Edward said. <div class="bookquote">``Well, your history, actually.''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``We didn't mean to disturb you,''  (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div>I apologized.
<div class="bookquote">``Not at all. Where are you going to start?''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``The Waggoner,''  (<font color='red'><b>Edward/Edward Cullen/Cullen</b></font>)</div>Edward replied, placing one hand lightly on my shoulder and spinning me around to

<p/>look back toward the door we'd just come through. Every time he (<font color='blue'><b>Edward</b></font>) touched me, in even the most casual
way, my heart had an audible reaction. It was more embarrassing with Carlisle there.
The wall we faced now was different from the others. Instead of bookshelves, this wall was crowded
with framed pictures of all sizes, some in vibrant colors, others dull monochromes. I searched for some
logic, some binding motif the collection had in common, but I found nothing in my hasty examination.
Edward pulled me toward the far left side, standing me in front of a small square oil painting in a plain
wooden frame. This one did not stand out among the bigger and brighter pieces; painted in varying tones
of sepia, it depicted a miniature city full of steeply slanted roofs, with thin spires atop a few scattered
towers. A wide river filled the foreground, crossed by a bridge covered with structures that looked like
tiny cathedrals.
<div class="bookquote">``London in the sixteen-fifties,''  (<font color='red'><b>Edward/Edward Cullen/Cullen</b></font>)</div>Edward said.
<div class="bookquote">``The London of my youth,''  (<font color='red'><b>Carlisle</b></font>)</div>Carlisle added, from a few feet behind us. I flinched; I hadn't heard him (<font color='blue'><b>Carlisle</b></font>)
approach. Edward squeezed my hand.
<div class="bookquote">``Will you tell the story?''  (<font color='red'><b>Edward/Edward Cullen/Cullen</b></font>)</div>Edward asked. I twisted a little to see Carlisle's reaction.
He (<font color='blue'><b>Carlisle</b></font>) met my glance and smiled. <div class="bookquote">``I would,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Carlisle</b></font>) replied. <div class="bookquote">``But I'm actually running a bit late. The hospital
called this morning  Dr. Snow is taking a sick day. Besides, you know the stories as well as I do,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Carlisle</b></font>)
added, grinning at Edward now.
It was a strange combination to absorb  the everyday concerns of the town doctor stuck in the middle
of a discussion of his (<font color='blue'><b>doctor</b></font>) early days in seventeenth-century London.
It was also unsettling to know that he (<font color='blue'><b>doctor</b></font>) spoke aloud only for my benefit.
After another warm smile for me, Carlisle left the room.
I stared at the little picture of Carlisle's hometown for a long moment.
<div class="bookquote">``What happened then?''  (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div>I finally asked, staring up at Edward, who was watching me. <div class="bookquote">``When he (<font color='blue'><b>Snow</b></font>) realized
what had happened to him (<font color='blue'><b>Snow</b></font>)?''
 (<font color='red'><b>He</b></font>)</div>He (<font color='blue'><b>Edward</b></font>) glanced back to the paintings, and I looked to see which image caught his (<font color='blue'><b>Edward</b></font>) interest now. It was a
larger landscape in dull fall colors  an empty, shadowed meadow in a forest, with a craggy peak in the
distance.
<div class="bookquote">``When he (<font color='blue'><b>Snow</b></font>) knew what he (<font color='blue'><b>Snow</b></font>) had become,''  (<font color='red'><b>Edward/Edward Cullen/Cullen</b></font>)</div>Edward said quietly, <div class="bookquote">``he (<font color='blue'><b>Snow</b></font>) rebelled against it. He (<font color='blue'><b>Snow</b></font>) tried to destroy
himself. But that's not easily done.''
 (<font color='red'><b>Edward/Edward Cullen/Cullen</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``How?''  (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div>I didn't mean to say it aloud, but the word broke through my shock.
<div class="bookquote">``He (<font color='blue'><b>Snow</b></font>) jumped from great heights,''  (<font color='red'><b>Edward/Edward Cullen/Cullen</b></font>)</div>Edward told me, his (<font color='blue'><b>Edward</b></font>) voice impassive. <div class="bookquote">``He (<font color='blue'><b>Snow</b></font>) tried to drown himself in the
ocean but he (<font color='blue'><b>Snow</b></font>) was young to the new life, and very strong. It is amazing that he (<font color='blue'><b>Snow</b></font>) was able to resist
feeding while he (<font color='blue'><b>Snow</b></font>) was still so new. The instinct is more powerful then, it takes over everything. But he (<font color='blue'><b>Snow</b></font>)
was so repelled by himself that he (<font color='blue'><b>Snow</b></font>) had the strength to try to kill himself with starvation.''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``Is that possible?''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>My voice was faint.
<div class="bookquote">``No, there are very few ways we can be killed.''
 (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div>I opened my mouth to ask, but he (<font color='blue'><b>Edward</b></font>) spoke before I could.

<p/>``So he (<font color='blue'><b>Snow</b></font>) grew very hungry, and eventually weak. He (<font color='blue'><b>Snow</b></font>) strayed as far as he (<font color='blue'><b>Snow</b></font>) could from the human populace,
recognizing that his (<font color='blue'><b>Snow</b></font>) willpower was weakening, too. For months he (<font color='blue'><b>Snow</b></font>) wandered by night, seeking the
loneliest places, loathing himself.
``One night, a herd of deer passed his (<font color='blue'><b>Snow</b></font>) hiding place. He (<font color='blue'><b>Snow</b></font>) was so wild with thirst that he (<font color='blue'><b>Snow</b></font>) attacked without a
thought. His (<font color='blue'><b>Snow</b></font>) strength returned and he (<font color='blue'><b>Snow</b></font>) realized there was an alternative to being the vile monster he (<font color='blue'><b>Snow</b></font>) feared.
Had he (<font color='blue'><b>Snow</b></font>) not eaten venison in his (<font color='blue'><b>Snow</b></font>) former life? Over the next months his (<font color='blue'><b>Snow</b></font>) new philosophy was born. He (<font color='blue'><b>Snow</b></font>)
could exist without being a demon. He (<font color='blue'><b>Snow</b></font>) found himself again.
<div class="bookquote">``He (<font color='blue'><b>Snow</b></font>) began to make better use of his (<font color='blue'><b>Snow</b></font>) time. He (<font color='blue'><b>Snow</b></font>)'d always been intelligent, eager to learn. Now he (<font color='blue'><b>Snow</b></font>) had
unlimited time before him (<font color='blue'><b>Snow</b></font>). He (<font color='blue'><b>Snow</b></font>) studied by night, planned by day. He (<font color='blue'><b>Snow</b></font>) swam to France and ''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``He (<font color='blue'><b>Snow</b></font>) swam to France?''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``People swim the Channel all the time, Bella,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Edward</b></font>) reminded me patiently.
<div class="bookquote">``That's true, I guess. It just sounded funny in that context. Go on.''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``Swimming is easy for us ''
 (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``Everything is easy for you,''  (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div>I griped.
He (<font color='blue'><b>Edward</b></font>) waited, his (<font color='blue'><b>Edward</b></font>) expression amused.
<div class="bookquote">``I won't interrupt again, I promise.''
 (<font color='red'><b>He</b></font>)</div>He (<font color='blue'><b>Edward</b></font>) chuckled darkly, and finished his (<font color='blue'><b>Edward</b></font>) sentence. <div class="bookquote">``Because, technically, we don't need to breathe.''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``You ''
 (<font color='red'><b>He</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``No, no, you promised.''  (<font color='red'><b>He</b></font>)</div>He (<font color='blue'><b>Edward</b></font>) laughed, putting his (<font color='blue'><b>Edward</b></font>) cold finger lightly to my lips. <div class="bookquote">``Do you want to hear the
story or not?''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``You can't spring something like that on me, and then expect me not to say anything,''  (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div>I mumbled against
his (<font color='blue'><b>Edward</b></font>) finger.
He (<font color='blue'><b>Edward</b></font>) lifted his (<font color='blue'><b>Edward</b></font>) hand, moving it to rest against my neck. The speed of my heart reacted to that, but I
persisted.
<div class="bookquote">``You don't have to breathe?''  (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div>I demanded.
<div class="bookquote">``No, it's not necessary. Just a habit.''  (<font color='red'><b>He</b></font>)</div>He (<font color='blue'><b>Edward</b></font>) shrugged.
<div class="bookquote">``How long can you go without breathing?''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``Indefinitely, I suppose; I don't know. It gets a bit uncomfortable  being without a sense of smell.''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``A bit uncomfortable,''  (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div>I echoed.
I wasn't paying attention to my own expression, but something in it made him (<font color='blue'><b>Edward</b></font>) grow somber. His (<font color='blue'><b>Edward</b></font>) hand
dropped to his (<font color='blue'><b>Edward</b></font>) side and he (<font color='blue'><b>Edward</b></font>) stood very still, his (<font color='blue'><b>Edward</b></font>) eyes intent on my face. The silence lengthened. His (<font color='blue'><b>Edward</b></font>)
features were immobile as stone.
<div class="bookquote">``What is it?''  (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div>I whispered, touching his (<font color='blue'><b>Edward</b></font>) frozen face.
His (<font color='blue'><b>Edward</b></font>) face softened under my hand, and he (<font color='blue'><b>Edward</b></font>) sighed. <div class="bookquote">``I keep waiting for it to happen.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``For what to happen?''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``I know that at some point, something I tell you or something you see is going to be too much. And then
you'll run away from me, screaming as you go.''  (<font color='red'><b>He</b></font>)</div>He (<font color='blue'><b>Edward</b></font>) smiled half a smile, but his (<font color='blue'><b>Edward</b></font>) eyes were serious. <div class="bookquote">``I won't
stop you. I want this to happen, because I want you to be safe. And yet, I want to be with you. The two
desires are impossible to reconcile''  (<font color='red'><b>He</b></font>)</div>He (<font color='blue'><b>Edward</b></font>) trailed off, staring at my face. Waiting.
<div class="bookquote">``I'm not running anywhere,''  (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div>I promised.
<div class="bookquote">``We'll see,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Edward</b></font>) said, smiling again.
I frowned at him (<font color='blue'><b>Edward</b></font>). <div class="bookquote">``So, go on  Carlisle was swimming to France.''
 (<font color='red'><b>He</b></font>)</div>He (<font color='blue'><b>Edward</b></font>) paused, getting back into his (<font color='blue'><b>Edward</b></font>) story. Reflexively, his (<font color='blue'><b>Edward</b></font>) eyes flickered to another picture  the most
colorful of them all, the most ornately framed, and the largest; it was twice as wide as the door it hung
next to. The canvas overflowed with bright figures in swirling robes, writhing around long pillars and off
marbled balconies. I couldn't tell if it represented Greek mythology, or if the characters floating in the
clouds above were meant to be biblical.
<div class="bookquote">``Carlisle swam to France, and continued on through Europe, to the universities there. By night he (<font color='blue'><b>Carlisle</b></font>) studied
music, science, medicine  and found his (<font color='blue'><b>Carlisle</b></font>) calling, his (<font color='blue'><b>Carlisle</b></font>) penance, in that, in saving human lives.''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>His (<font color='blue'><b>Edward</b></font>)
expression became awed, almost reverent. <div class="bookquote">``I can't adequately describe the struggle; it took Carlisle two
centuries of torturous effort to perfect his (<font color='blue'><b>Carlisle</b></font>) self-control. Now he (<font color='blue'><b>Carlisle</b></font>) is all but immune to the scent of human
blood, and he (<font color='blue'><b>Carlisle</b></font>) is able to do the work he (<font color='blue'><b>Carlisle</b></font>) loves without agony. He (<font color='blue'><b>Carlisle</b></font>) finds a great deal of peace there, at the
hospital''  (<font color='red'><b>Edward/Edward Cullen/Cullen</b></font>)</div>Edward stared off into space for a long moment. Suddenly he (<font color='blue'><b>Edward</b></font>) seemed to recall his (<font color='blue'><b>Edward</b></font>) purpose.
He (<font color='blue'><b>Edward</b></font>) tapped his (<font color='blue'><b>Edward</b></font>) finger against the huge painting in front of us.
<div class="bookquote">``He (<font color='blue'><b>Carlisle</b></font>) was studying in Italy when he (<font color='blue'><b>Carlisle</b></font>) discovered the others there. They were much more civilized and
educated than the wraiths of the London sewers.''
 (<font color='red'><b>He</b></font>)</div>He (<font color='blue'><b>Edward</b></font>) touched a comparatively sedate quartet of figures painted on the highest balcony, looking down
calmly on the mayhem below them. I examined the grouping carefully and realized, with a startled laugh,
that I recognized the golden-haired man.
<div class="bookquote">``Solimena was greatly inspired by Carlisle's friends. He (<font color='blue'><b>Carlisle</b></font>) often painted them as gods,''  (<font color='red'><b>Edward/Edward Cullen/Cullen</b></font>)</div>Edward chuckled.
<div class="bookquote">``Aro, Marcus, Caius,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Edward</b></font>) said, indicating the other three, two black-haired, one snowy-white. <div class="bookquote">``Nighttime
patrons of the arts.''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``What happened to them?''  (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div>I wondered aloud, my fingertip hovering a centimeter from the figures on the
canvas.
<div class="bookquote">``They're still there.''  (<font color='red'><b>He</b></font>)</div>He (<font color='blue'><b>Edward</b></font>) shrugged. <div class="bookquote">``As they have been for who knows how many millennia. Carlisle
stayed with them only for a short time, just a few decades. He (<font color='blue'><b>Carlisle</b></font>) greatly admired their civility, their
refinement, but they persisted in trying to cure his (<font color='blue'><b>Carlisle</b></font>) aversion to `his (<font color='blue'><b>Carlisle</b></font>) natural food source,''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>as they called it.
They tried to persuade him (<font color='blue'><b>Edward</b></font>), and he (<font color='blue'><b>Edward</b></font>) tried to persuade them, to no avail. At that point, Carlisle decided to
try the New World. He (<font color='blue'><b>Carlisle</b></font>) dreamed of finding others like himself. He (<font color='blue'><b>Carlisle</b></font>) was very lonely, you see.
``He (<font color='blue'><b>Carlisle</b></font>) didn't find anyone for a long time. But, as monsters became the stuff of fairy tales, he (<font color='blue'><b>Carlisle</b></font>) found he (<font color='blue'><b>Carlisle</b></font>) could
interact with unsuspecting humans as if he (<font color='blue'><b>Carlisle</b></font>) were one of them. He (<font color='blue'><b>Carlisle</b></font>) began practicing medicine. But the
companionship he (<font color='blue'><b>Carlisle</b></font>) craved evaded him (<font color='blue'><b>Carlisle</b></font>); he (<font color='blue'><b>Carlisle</b></font>) couldn't risk familiarity.
``When the influenza epidemic hit, he (<font color='blue'><b>Carlisle</b></font>) was working nights in a hospital in Chicago. He (<font color='blue'><b>Carlisle</b></font>)'d been turning over
an idea in his (<font color='blue'><b>Carlisle</b></font>) mind for several years, and he (<font color='blue'><b>Carlisle</b></font>) had almost decided to act  since he (<font color='blue'><b>Carlisle</b></font>) couldn't find a

so he (<font color='blue'><b>Carlisle</b></font>) was hesitant. And he (<font color='blue'><b>Carlisle</b></font>) was loath to steal anyone's life the way his (<font color='blue'><b>Carlisle</b></font>) had been stolen. It was in that
frame of mind that he (<font color='blue'><b>Carlisle</b></font>) found me. There was no hope for me; I was left in a ward with the dying. He (<font color='blue'><b>Carlisle</b></font>) had
nursed my parents, and knew I was alone. He (<font color='blue'><b>Carlisle</b></font>) decided to try''
His (<font color='blue'><b>Carlisle</b></font>) voice, nearly a whisper now, trailed off. He (<font color='blue'><b>Carlisle</b></font>) stared unseeingly through the west windows. I wondered
which images filled his (<font color='blue'><b>Carlisle</b></font>) mind now, Carlisle's memories or his (<font color='blue'><b>Carlisle</b></font>) own. I waited quietly.
When he (<font color='blue'><b>Carlisle</b></font>) turned back to me, a gentle angel's smile lit his (<font color='blue'><b>Carlisle</b></font>) expression.
``And so we've come full circle,'' he (<font color='blue'><b>Carlisle</b></font>) concluded.
``Have you always stayed with Carlisle, then?'' I wondered.
``Almost always.'' He (<font color='blue'><b>Carlisle</b></font>) put his (<font color='blue'><b>Carlisle</b></font>) hand lightly on my waist and pulled me with him (<font color='blue'><b>Carlisle</b></font>) as he (<font color='blue'><b>Carlisle</b></font>) walked through the
door. I stared back at the wall of pictures, wondering if I would ever get to hear the other stories.
Edward didn't say any more as we walked down the hall, so I asked, ``Almost?''
He (<font color='blue'><b>Edward</b></font>) sighed, seeming reluctant to answer. ``Well, I had a typical bout of rebellious adolescence  about
ten years after I was born created, whatever you want to call it. I wasn't sold on his (<font color='blue'><b>Carlisle</b></font>) life of
abstinence, and I resented him (<font color='blue'><b>Carlisle</b></font>) for curbing my appetite. So I went off on my own for a time.''
``Really?'' I was intrigued, rather than frightened, as I perhaps should have been.
He (<font color='blue'><b>Edward</b></font>) could tell. I vaguely realized that we were headed up the next flight of stairs, but I wasn't paying much
attention to my surroundings.
``That doesn't repulse you?''
``No.''
``Why not?''
``I guess it sounds reasonable.''
He (<font color='blue'><b>Edward</b></font>) barked a laugh, more loudly than before. We were at the top of the stairs now, in another paneled
hallway.
``From the time of my new birth,'' he (<font color='blue'><b>Edward</b></font>) murmured, ``I had the advantage of knowing what everyone around
me was thinking, both human and non-human alike. That's why it took me ten years to defy Carlisle  I
could read his (<font color='blue'><b>Carlisle</b></font>) perfect sincerity, understand exactly why he (<font color='blue'><b>Carlisle</b></font>) lived the way he (<font color='blue'><b>Carlisle</b></font>) did.
<div class="bookquote">``It took me only a few years to return to Carlisle and recommit to his (<font color='blue'><b>Carlisle</b></font>) vision. I thought I would be exempt
from the depression that accompanies a conscience. Because I knew the thoughts of my prey, I
could pass over the innocent and pursue only the evil. If I followed a murderer down a dark alley where
he (<font color='blue'><b>murderer</b></font>) stalked a young girl  if I saved her (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>), then surely I wasn't so terrible.''
 (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div>I shivered, imagining only too clearly what he (<font color='blue'><b>Edward</b></font>) described  the alley at night, the frightened girl, the dark
man behind her (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>). And Edward, Edward as he (<font color='blue'><b>Edward</b></font>) hunted, terrible and glorious as a young god, unstoppable.
Would she (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) have been grateful, that girl, or more frightened than before?
<div class="bookquote">``But as time went on, I began to see the monster in my eyes. I couldn't escape the debt of so much
human life taken, no matter how justified. And I went back to Carlisle and Esme. They welcomed me
back like the prodigal. It was more than I deserved.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/>We'd come to a stop in front of the last door in the hall.
<div class="bookquote">``My room,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>god</b></font>) informed me, opening it and pulling me through.
His (<font color='blue'><b>god</b></font>) room faced south, with a wall-sized window like the great room below. The whole back side of the
house must be glass. His (<font color='blue'><b>god</b></font>) view looked down on the winding Sol Duc River, across the untouched forest
to the Olympic Mountain range. The mountains were much closer than I would have believed.
The western wall was completely covered with shelf after shelf of CDs. His (<font color='blue'><b>Duc</b></font>) room was better stocked
than a music store. In the corner was a sophisticated-looking sound system, the kind I was afraid to
touch because I'd be sure to break something. There was no bed, only a wide and inviting black leather
sofa. The floor was covered with a thick golden carpet, and the walls were hung with heavy fabric in a
slightly darker shade.
<div class="bookquote">``Good acoustics?''  (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div>I guessed.
He (<font color='blue'><b>Duc</b></font>) chuckled and nodded.
He (<font color='blue'><b>Duc</b></font>) picked up a remote and turned the stereo on. It was quiet, but the soft jazz number sounded like the
band was in the room with us. I went to look at his (<font color='blue'><b>Duc</b></font>) mind-boggling music collection.
<div class="bookquote">``How do you have these organized?''  (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div>I asked, unable to find any rhyme or reason to the titles.
He (<font color='blue'><b>Duc</b></font>) wasn't paying attention.
<div class="bookquote">``Ummm, by year, and then by personal preference within that frame,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Duc</b></font>) said absently.
I turned, and he (<font color='blue'><b>Duc</b></font>) was looking at me with a peculiar expression in his (<font color='blue'><b>Duc</b></font>) eyes.
<div class="bookquote">``What?''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``I was prepared to feel relieved. Having you know about everything, not needing to keep secrets from
you. But I didn't expect to feel more than that. I like it. It makes me happy.''  (<font color='red'><b>He</b></font>)</div>He (<font color='blue'><b>Duc</b></font>) shrugged, smiling
slightly.
<div class="bookquote">``I'm glad,''  (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div>I said, smiling back. I'd worried that he (<font color='blue'><b>Duc</b></font>) might regret telling me these things. It was good to
know that wasn't the case.
But then, as his (<font color='blue'><b>Duc</b></font>) eyes dissected my expression, his (<font color='blue'><b>Duc</b></font>) smile faded and his (<font color='blue'><b>Duc</b></font>) forehead creased.
<div class="bookquote">``You're still waiting for the running and the screaming, aren't you?''  (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div>I guessed.
A faint smile touched his (<font color='blue'><b>Duc</b></font>) lips, and he (<font color='blue'><b>Duc</b></font>) nodded.
<div class="bookquote">``I hate to burst your bubble, but you're really not as scary as you think you are. I don't find you scary at
all, actually,''  (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div>I lied casually.
He (<font color='blue'><b>Duc</b></font>) stopped, raising his (<font color='blue'><b>Duc</b></font>) eyebrows in blatant disbelief. Then he (<font color='blue'><b>Duc</b></font>) flashed a wide, wicked smile.
<div class="bookquote">``You really shouldn't have said that,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Duc</b></font>) chuckled.
He (<font color='blue'><b>Duc</b></font>) growled, a low sound in the back of his (<font color='blue'><b>Duc</b></font>) throat; his (<font color='blue'><b>Duc</b></font>) lips curled back over his (<font color='blue'><b>Duc</b></font>) perfect teeth. His (<font color='blue'><b>Duc</b></font>) body
shifted suddenly, half-crouched, tensed like a lion about to pounce.
I backed away from him (<font color='blue'><b>Duc</b></font>), glaring.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``You wouldn't.''
 (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div>I didn't see him (<font color='blue'><b>Duc</b></font>) leap at me  it was much too fast. I only found myself suddenly airborne, and then we
crashed onto the sofa, knocking it into the wall. All the while, his (<font color='blue'><b>Duc</b></font>) arms formed an iron cage of protection
around me  I was barely jostled. But I still was gasping as I tried to right myself.
He (<font color='blue'><b>Duc</b></font>) wasn't having that. He (<font color='blue'><b>Duc</b></font>) curled me into a ball against his (<font color='blue'><b>Duc</b></font>) chest, holding me more securely than iron
chains. I glared at him (<font color='blue'><b>Duc</b></font>) in alarm, but he (<font color='blue'><b>Duc</b></font>) seemed well in control, his (<font color='blue'><b>Duc</b></font>) jaw relaxed as he (<font color='blue'><b>Duc</b></font>) grinned, his (<font color='blue'><b>Duc</b></font>) eyes
bright only with humor.
<div class="bookquote">``You were saying?''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Duc</b></font>) growled playfully.
<div class="bookquote">``That you are a very, very terrifying monster,''  (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div>I said, my sarcasm marred a bit by my breathless voice.
<div class="bookquote">``Much better,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Duc</b></font>) approved.
<div class="bookquote">``Um.''  (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div>I struggled. <div class="bookquote">``Can I get up now?''
 (<font color='red'><b>He</b></font>)</div>He (<font color='blue'><b>Duc</b></font>) just laughed.
<div class="bookquote">``Can we come in?''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>a soft voice sounded from the hall.
I struggled to free myself, but Edward merely readjusted me so that I was somewhat more conventionally
seated on his (<font color='blue'><b>Edward</b></font>) lap. I could see it was Alice, then, and Jasper behind her (<font color='blue'><b>Alice</b></font>) in the doorway. My cheeks
burned, but Edward seemed at ease.
<div class="bookquote">``Go ahead.''  (<font color='red'><b>Edward/Edward Cullen/Cullen</b></font>)</div>Edward was still chuckling quietly.
Alice seemed to find nothing unusual in our embrace; she (<font color='blue'><b>Alice</b></font>) walked  almost danced, her (<font color='blue'><b>Alice</b></font>) movements
were so graceful  to the center of the room, where she (<font color='blue'><b>Alice</b></font>) folded herself sinuously onto the floor. Jasper,
however, paused at the door, his (<font color='blue'><b>Jasper</b></font>) expression a trifle shocked. He (<font color='blue'><b>Jasper</b></font>) stared at Edward's face, and I
wondered if he (<font color='blue'><b>Jasper</b></font>) was tasting the atmosphere with his (<font color='blue'><b>Jasper</b></font>) unusual sensitivity.
<div class="bookquote">``It sounded like you were having Bella for lunch, and we came to see if you would share,''  (<font color='red'><b>Alice</b></font>)</div>Alice
announced.
I stiffened for an instant, until I realized Edward was grinning  whether at her (<font color='blue'><b>Alice</b></font>) comment or my response,
I couldn't tell.
<div class="bookquote">``Sorry, I don't believe I have enough to spare,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Edward</b></font>) replied, his (<font color='blue'><b>Edward</b></font>) arms holding me recklessly close.
<div class="bookquote">``Actually,''  (<font color='red'><b>Jasper</b></font>)</div>Jasper said, smiling despite himself as he (<font color='blue'><b>Jasper</b></font>) walked into the room, <div class="bookquote">``Alice says there's going to be
a real storm tonight, and Emmett wants to play ball. Are you game?''
 (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>The words were all common enough, but the context confused me. I gathered that Alice was a bit more
reliable than the weatherman, though.
Edward's eyes lit up, but he (<font color='blue'><b>Edward</b></font>) hesitated.
<div class="bookquote">``Of course you should bring Bella,''  (<font color='red'><b>Alice</b></font>)</div>Alice chirped. I thought I saw Jasper throw a quick glance at her (<font color='blue'><b>Alice</b></font>).
<div class="bookquote">``Do you want to go?''  (<font color='red'><b>Edward/Edward Cullen/Cullen</b></font>)</div>Edward asked me, excited, his (<font color='blue'><b>Edward</b></font>) expression vivid.
<div class="bookquote">``Sure.''  (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div>I couldn't disappoint such a face. <div class="bookquote">``Um, where are we going?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``We have to wait for thunder to play ball  you'll see why,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Edward</b></font>) promised.
<div class="bookquote">``Will I need an umbrella?''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>They all three laughed aloud.
<div class="bookquote">``Will she (<font color='blue'><b>Bella</b></font>)?''  (<font color='red'><b>Jasper</b></font>)</div>Jasper asked Alice.
<div class="bookquote">``No.''  (<font color='red'><b>She</b></font>)</div>She (<font color='blue'><b>Alice</b></font>) was positive. <div class="bookquote">``The storm will hit over town. It should be dry enough in the clearing.''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``Good, then.''  (<font color='red'><b>Jasper</b></font>)</div>The enthusiasm in Jasper's voice was catching, naturally. I found myself eager, rather than
scared stiff.
<div class="bookquote">``Let's go see if Carlisle will come.''  (<font color='red'><b>Alice</b></font>)</div>Alice bounded up and to the door in a fashion that would break any
ballerina's heart.
<div class="bookquote">``Like you don't know,''  (<font color='red'><b>Jasper</b></font>)</div>Jasper teased, and they were swiftly on their way. Jasper managed to
inconspicuously close the door behind them.
<div class="bookquote">``What will we be playing?''  (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div>I demanded.
<div class="bookquote">``You will be watching,''  (<font color='red'><b>Edward/Edward Cullen/Cullen</b></font>)</div>Edward clarified. <div class="bookquote">``We will be playing baseball.''
 (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div>I rolled my eyes. <div class="bookquote">``Vampires like baseball?''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``It's the American pastime,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Edward</b></font>) said with mock solemnity.

<p/>17. THE GAME

<p/>It was just beginning to drizzle when Edward turned onto my street. Up until that moment, I'd had no
doubt that he (<font color='blue'><b>Edward</b></font>)'d be staying with me while I spent a few interim hours in the real world.
And then I saw the black car, a weathered Ford, parked in Charlie's driveway  and heard Edward
mutter something unintelligible in a low, harsh voice.
Leaning away from the rain under the shallow front porch, Jacob Black stood behind his (<font color='blue'><b>Black</b></font>) father's
wheelchair. Billy's face was impassive as stone as Edward parked my truck against the curb. Jacob
stared down, his (<font color='blue'><b>Jacob</b></font>) expression mortified.
Edward's low voice was furious. <div class="bookquote">``This is crossing the line.''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``He (<font color='blue'><b>Carlisle</b></font>) came to warn Charlie?''  (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div>I guessed, more horrified than angry.
Edward just nodded, answering Billy's gaze through the rain with narrowed eyes.
I felt weak with relief that Charlie wasn't home yet.
<div class="bookquote">``Let me deal with this,''  (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div>I suggested. Edward's black glare made me anxious.
To my surprise, he (<font color='blue'><b>Edward</b></font>) agreed. <div class="bookquote">``That's probably best. Be careful, though. The child has no idea.''
 (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div>I bridled a little at the word child. <div class="bookquote">``Jacob is not that much younger than I am,''  (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div>I reminded him (<font color='blue'><b>Edward</b></font>).

<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Edward</b></font>) looked at me then, his (<font color='blue'><b>Edward</b></font>) anger abruptly fading. <div class="bookquote">``Oh, I know,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Edward</b></font>) assured me with a grin.
I sighed and put my hand on the door handle.
<div class="bookquote">``Get them inside,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Edward</b></font>) instructed, <div class="bookquote">``so I can leave. I'll be back around dusk.''
 (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``Do you want my truck?''  (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div>I offered, meanwhile wondering how I would explain its absence to Charlie.
He (<font color='blue'><b>Charlie</b></font>) rolled his (<font color='blue'><b>Charlie</b></font>) eyes. <div class="bookquote">``I could walk home faster than this truck moves.''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``You don't have to leave,''  (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div>I said wistfully.
He (<font color='blue'><b>Charlie</b></font>) smiled at my glum expression. <div class="bookquote">``Actually, I do. After you get rid of them''   (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Charlie</b></font>) threw a dark glance in
the Blacks' direction  <div class="bookquote">``you still have to prepare Charlie to meet your new boyfriend.''  (<font color='red'><b>the Blacks</b></font>)</div>He (<font color='blue'><b>Charlie</b></font>) grinned
widely, showing all of his (<font color='blue'><b>Charlie</b></font>) teeth.
I groaned. <div class="bookquote">``Thanks a lot.''
 (<font color='red'><b>He</b></font>)</div>He (<font color='blue'><b>Charlie</b></font>) smiled the crooked smile that I loved. <div class="bookquote">``I'll be back soon,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Charlie</b></font>) promised. His (<font color='blue'><b>Charlie</b></font>) eyes flickered back to the
porch, and then he (<font color='blue'><b>Charlie</b></font>) leaned in to swiftly kiss me just under the edge of my jaw. My heart lurched
frantically, and I, too, glanced toward the porch. Billy's face was no longer impassive, and his (<font color='blue'><b>Billy</b></font>) hands
clutched at the armrests of his (<font color='blue'><b>Billy</b></font>) chair.
<div class="bookquote">``Soon,''  (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div>I stressed as I opened the door and stepped out into the rain.
I could feel his (<font color='blue'><b>Billy</b></font>) eyes on my back as I half-ran through the light sprinkle toward the porch.
<div class="bookquote">``Hey, Billy. Hi, Jacob.''  (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div>I greeted them as cheerfully as I could manage. <div class="bookquote">``Charlie's gone for the day  I
hope you haven't been waiting long.''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``Not long,''  (<font color='red'><b>Billy/Billy Black</b></font>)</div>Billy said in a subdued tone. His (<font color='blue'><b>Billy</b></font>) black eyes were piercing. <div class="bookquote">``I just wanted to bring this up.''  (<font color='red'><b>He</b></font>)</div>He (<font color='blue'><b>Billy</b></font>)
indicated a brown paper sack resting in his (<font color='blue'><b>Billy</b></font>) lap.
<div class="bookquote">``Thanks,''  (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div>I said, though I had no idea what it could be. <div class="bookquote">``Why don't you come in for a minute and dry
off?''
 (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div>I pretended to be oblivious to his (<font color='blue'><b>Billy</b></font>) intense scrutiny as I unlocked the door, and waved them in ahead of
me.
<div class="bookquote">``Here, let me take that,''  (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div>I offered, turning to shut the door. I allowed myself one last glance at Edward.
He (<font color='blue'><b>Edward</b></font>) was waiting, perfectly still, his (<font color='blue'><b>Edward</b></font>) eyes solemn.
<div class="bookquote">``You'll want to put it in the fridge,''  (<font color='red'><b>Billy/Billy Black</b></font>)</div>Billy noted as he (<font color='blue'><b>Billy</b></font>) handed me the package. <div class="bookquote">``It's some of Harry
Clearwater's homemade fish fry  Charlie's favorite. The fridge keeps it drier.''  (<font color='red'><b>He</b></font>)</div>He (<font color='blue'><b>Billy</b></font>) shrugged.
<div class="bookquote">``Thanks,''  (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div>I repeated, but with feeling this time. <div class="bookquote">``I was running out of new ways to fix fish, and he (<font color='blue'><b>Charlie</b></font>)'s bound
to bring home more tonight.''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``Fishing again?''  (<font color='red'><b>Billy/Billy Black</b></font>)</div>Billy asked with a subtle gleam in his (<font color='blue'><b>Billy</b></font>) eye. <div class="bookquote">``Down at the usual spot? Maybe I'll run by
and see him (<font color='blue'><b>Charlie</b></font>).''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``No,''  (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div>I quickly lied, my face going hard. <div class="bookquote">``He (<font color='blue'><b>Charlie</b></font>) was headed someplace new but I have no idea where.''
 (<font color='red'><b>He</b></font>)</div>He (<font color='blue'><b>Billy</b></font>) took in my changed expression, and it made him (<font color='blue'><b>Billy</b></font>) thoughtful.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Jake,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Billy</b></font>) said, still appraising me. <div class="bookquote">``Why don't you go get that new picture of Rebecca out of the car? I'll
leave that for Charlie, too.''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``Where is it?''  (<font color='red'><b>Jacob/Jacob Black</b></font>)</div>Jacob asked, his (<font color='blue'><b>Jacob</b></font>) voice morose. I glanced at him (<font color='blue'><b>Jacob</b></font>), but he (<font color='blue'><b>Jacob</b></font>) was staring at the floor, his (<font color='blue'><b>Jacob</b></font>)
eyebrows pulling together.
<div class="bookquote">``I think I saw it in the trunk,''  (<font color='red'><b>Billy/Billy Black</b></font>)</div>Billy said. <div class="bookquote">``You may have to dig for it.''
 (<font color='red'><b>Jacob/Jacob Black</b></font>)</div>Jacob slouched back out into the rain.
Billy and I faced each other in silence. After a few seconds, the quiet started to feel awkward, so I turned
and headed to the kitchen. I could hear his (<font color='blue'><b>Billy</b></font>) wet wheels squeak against the linoleum as he (<font color='blue'><b>Billy</b></font>) followed.
I shoved the bag onto the crowded top shelf of the fridge, and spun around to confront him (<font color='blue'><b>Billy</b></font>). His (<font color='blue'><b>Billy</b></font>) deeply
lined face was unreadable.
<div class="bookquote">``Charlie won't be back for a long time.''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>My voice was almost rude.
He (<font color='blue'><b>Billy</b></font>) nodded in agreement, but said nothing.
<div class="bookquote">``Thanks again for the fish fry,''  (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div>I hinted.
He (<font color='blue'><b>Billy</b></font>) continued nodding. I sighed and folded my arms across my chest.
He (<font color='blue'><b>Billy</b></font>) seemed to sense that I had given up on small talk. <div class="bookquote">``Bella,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Billy</b></font>) said, and then he (<font color='blue'><b>Billy</b></font>) hesitated.
I waited.
<div class="bookquote">``Bella,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Billy</b></font>) said again, <div class="bookquote">``Charlie is one of my best friends.''
 (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``Yes.''
 (<font color='red'><b>He</b></font>)</div>He (<font color='blue'><b>Billy</b></font>) spoke each word carefully in his (<font color='blue'><b>Billy</b></font>) rumbling voice. <div class="bookquote">``I noticed you've been spending time with one of the
Cullens.''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``Yes,''  (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div>I repeated curtly.
His (<font color='blue'><b>Billy</b></font>) eyes narrowed. <div class="bookquote">``Maybe it's none of my business, but I don't think that is such a good idea.''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``You're right,''  (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div>I agreed. <div class="bookquote">``It is none of your business.''
 (<font color='red'><b>He</b></font>)</div>He (<font color='blue'><b>Billy</b></font>) raised his (<font color='blue'><b>Billy</b></font>) graying eyebrows at my tone. <div class="bookquote">``You probably don't know this, but the Cullen family has an
unpleasant reputation on the reservation.''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``Actually, I did know that,''  (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div>I informed him (<font color='blue'><b>Billy</b></font>) in a hard voice. This surprised him (<font color='blue'><b>Billy</b></font>). <div class="bookquote">``But that reputation
couldn't be deserved, could it? Because the Cullens never set foot on the reservation, do they?''  (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div>I could
see that my less than subtle reminder of the agreement that both bound and protected his (<font color='blue'><b>Billy</b></font>) tribe pulled him (<font color='blue'><b>Billy</b></font>)
up short.
<div class="bookquote">``That's true,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Billy</b></font>) acceded, his (<font color='blue'><b>Billy</b></font>) eyes guarded. <div class="bookquote">``You seem well informed about the Cullens. More
informed than I expected.''
 (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div>I stared him (<font color='blue'><b>Billy</b></font>) down. <div class="bookquote">``Maybe even better informed than you are.''
 (<font color='red'><b>He</b></font>)</div>He (<font color='blue'><b>Billy</b></font>) pursed his (<font color='blue'><b>Billy</b></font>) thick lips as he (<font color='blue'><b>Billy</b></font>) considered that. <div class="bookquote">``Maybe.''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Billy</b></font>) allowed, but his (<font color='blue'><b>Billy</b></font>) eyes were shrewd. <div class="bookquote">``Is
Charlie as well informed?''

 (<font color='red'><b>He</b></font>)</div><p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Billy</b></font>) had found the weak chink in my armor.
<div class="bookquote">``Charlie likes the Cullens a lot,''  (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div>I hedged. He (<font color='blue'><b>Billy</b></font>) clearly understood my evasion. His (<font color='blue'><b>Billy</b></font>) expression was
unhappy, but unsurprised.
<div class="bookquote">``It's not my business,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Billy</b></font>) said. <div class="bookquote">``But it may be Charlie's.''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``Though it would be my business, again, whether or not I think that it's Charlie's business, right?''
 (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div>I wondered if he (<font color='blue'><b>Billy</b></font>) even understood my confused question as I struggled not to say anything compromising.
But he (<font color='blue'><b>Billy</b></font>) seemed to. He (<font color='blue'><b>Billy</b></font>) thought about it while the rain picked up against the roof, the only sound breaking
the silence.
<div class="bookquote">``Yes,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Billy</b></font>) finally surrendered. <div class="bookquote">``I guess that's your business, too.''
 (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div>I sighed with relief. <div class="bookquote">``Thanks, Billy.''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``Just think about what you're doing, Bella,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Billy</b></font>) urged.
<div class="bookquote">``Okay,''  (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div>I agreed quickly.
He (<font color='blue'><b>Billy</b></font>) frowned. <div class="bookquote">``What I meant to say was, don't do what you're doing.''
 (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div>I looked into his (<font color='blue'><b>Billy</b></font>) eyes, filled with nothing but concern for me, and there was nothing I could say.
Just then the front door banged loudly, and I jumped at the sound.
<div class="bookquote">``There's no picture anywhere in that car.''  (<font color='red'><b>Jacob/Jacob Black</b></font>)</div>Jacob's complaining voice reached us before he (<font color='blue'><b>Jacob</b></font>) did. The
shoulders of his (<font color='blue'><b>Jacob</b></font>) shirt were stained with the rain, his (<font color='blue'><b>Jacob</b></font>) hair dripping, when he (<font color='blue'><b>Jacob</b></font>) rounded the corner.
<div class="bookquote">``Hmm,''  (<font color='red'><b>Billy/Billy Black</b></font>)</div>Billy grunted, suddenly detached, spinning his (<font color='blue'><b>Billy</b></font>) chair around to face his (<font color='blue'><b>Billy</b></font>) son. <div class="bookquote">``I guess I left it at
home.''
 (<font color='red'><b>Jacob/Jacob Black</b></font>)</div>Jacob rolled his (<font color='blue'><b>Jacob</b></font>) eyes dramatically. <div class="bookquote">``Great.''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``Well, Bella, tell Charlie''   (<font color='red'><b>Billy/Billy Black</b></font>)</div>Billy paused before continuing  <div class="bookquote">``that we stopped by, I mean.''
 (<font color='red'><b>Billy/Billy Black</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``I will,''  (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div>I muttered.
Jacob was surprised. <div class="bookquote">``Are we leaving already?''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``Charlie's gonna be out late,''  (<font color='red'><b>Billy/Billy Black</b></font>)</div>Billy explained as he (<font color='blue'><b>Billy</b></font>) rolled himself past Jacob.
<div class="bookquote">``Oh.''  (<font color='red'><b>Jacob/Jacob Black</b></font>)</div>Jacob looked disappointed. <div class="bookquote">``Well, I guess I'll see you later, then, Bella.''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``Sure,''  (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div>I agreed.
<div class="bookquote">``Take care,''  (<font color='red'><b>Billy/Billy Black</b></font>)</div>Billy warned me. I didn't answer.
Jacob helped his (<font color='blue'><b>Jacob</b></font>) father out the door. I waved briefly, glancing swiftly toward my now-empty truck, and
then shut the door before they were gone.
I stood in the hallway for a minute, listening to the sound of their car as it backed out and drove away. I
stayed where I was, waiting for the irritation and anxiety to subside. When the tension eventually faded a
bit, I headed upstairs to change out of my dressy clothes.

<p/>I tried on a couple of different tops, not sure what to expect tonight. As I concentrated on what was
coming, what had just passed became insignificant. Now that I was removed from Jasper's and Edward's
influence, I began to make up for not being terrified before. I gave up quickly on choosing an outfit 
throwing on an old flannel shirt and jeans  knowing I would be in my raincoat all night anyway.
The phone rang and I sprinted downstairs to get it. There was only one voice I wanted to hear; anything
else would be a disappointment. But I knew that if he (<font color='blue'><b>Edward</b></font>) wanted to talk to me, he (<font color='blue'><b>Edward</b></font>)'d probably just
materialize in my room.
<div class="bookquote">``Hello?''  (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div>I asked, breathless.
<div class="bookquote">``Bella? It's me,''  (<font color='red'><b>Jessica</b></font>)</div>Jessica said.
<div class="bookquote">``Oh, hey, Jess.''  (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div>I scrambled for a moment to come back down to reality. It felt like months rather than
days since I'd spoken to Jess. <div class="bookquote">``How was the dance?''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``It was so much fun!''  (<font color='red'><b>Jessica</b></font>)</div>Jessica gushed. Needing no more invitation than that, she (<font color='blue'><b>Jessica</b></font>) launched into a
minute-by-minute account of the previous night. I mmm'd and ahh'd at the right places, but it wasn't easy
to concentrate. Jessica, Mike, the dance, the school  they all seemed strangely irrelevant at the
moment. My eyes kept flashing to the window, trying to judge the degree of light behind the heavy
clouds.
<div class="bookquote">``Did you hear what I said, Bella?''  (<font color='red'><b>Jess</b></font>)</div>Jess asked, irritated.
<div class="bookquote">``I'm sorry, what?''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``I said, Mike kissed me! Can you believe it?''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``That's wonderful, Jess,''  (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div>I said.
<div class="bookquote">``So what did you do yesterday?''  (<font color='red'><b>Jessica</b></font>)</div>Jessica challenged, still sounding bothered by my lack of attention. Or
maybe she (<font color='blue'><b>Jessica</b></font>) was upset because I hadn't asked for details.
<div class="bookquote">``Nothing, really. I just hung around outside to enjoy the sun.''
 (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div>I heard Charlie's car in the garage.
<div class="bookquote">``Did you ever hear anything more from Edward Cullen?''
 (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div>The front door slammed and I could hear Charlie banging around under the stairs, putting his (<font color='blue'><b>Charlie</b></font>) tackle
away.
<div class="bookquote">``Um.''  (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div>I hesitated, not sure what my story was anymore.
<div class="bookquote">``Hi there, kiddo!''  (<font color='red'><b>Charlie</b></font>)</div>Charlie called as he (<font color='blue'><b>Charlie</b></font>) walked into the kitchen. I waved at him (<font color='blue'><b>Charlie</b></font>).
Jess heard his (<font color='blue'><b>Charlie</b></font>) voice. <div class="bookquote">``Oh, your dad's there. Never mind  we'll talk tomorrow. See you in Trig.''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``See ya, Jess.''  (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div>I hung up the phone.
<div class="bookquote">``Hey, Dad,''  (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div>I said. He (<font color='blue'><b>Charlie</b></font>) was scrubbing his (<font color='blue'><b>Charlie</b></font>) hands in the sink. <div class="bookquote">``Where's the fish?''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``I put it out in the freezer.''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>``I'll go grab a few pieces before they freeze  Billy dropped off some of Harry Clearwater's fish fry this

<p/>afternoon.'' I worked to sound enthusiastic.
``He (<font color='blue'><b>Billy</b></font>) did?'' Charlie's eyes lit up. ``That's my favorite.''
Charlie cleaned up while I got dinner ready. It didn't take long till we were sitting at the table, eating in
silence. Charlie was enjoying his (<font color='blue'><b>Charlie</b></font>) food. I was wondering desperately how to fulfill my assignment,
struggling to think of a way to broach the subject.
``What did you do with yourself today?'' he (<font color='blue'><b>Charlie</b></font>) asked, snapping me out of my reverie.
``Well, this afternoon I just hung out around the house'' Only the very recent part of this afternoon,
actually. I tried to keep my voice upbeat, but my stomach was hollow. ``And this morning I was over at
the Cullens'.''
Charlie dropped his (<font color='blue'><b>Charlie</b></font>) fork.
``Dr. Cullen's place?'' he (<font color='blue'><b>Charlie</b></font>) asked in astonishment.
I pretended not to notice his (<font color='blue'><b>Charlie</b></font>) reaction. ``Yeah.''
``What were you doing there?'' He (<font color='blue'><b>Charlie</b></font>) hadn't picked his (<font color='blue'><b>Charlie</b></font>) fork back up.
``Well, I sort of have a date with Edward Cullen tonight, and he (<font color='blue'><b>Cullen</b></font>) wanted to introduce me to his (<font color='blue'><b>Cullen</b></font>) parents
Dad?''
It appeared that Charlie was having an aneurysm.
``Dad, are you all right?''
``You are going out with Edward Cullen?'' he (<font color='blue'><b>Charlie</b></font>) thundered.
Uh-oh. ``I thought you liked the Cullens.''
``He (<font color='blue'><b>Cullen</b></font>)'s too old for you,'' he (<font color='blue'><b>Charlie</b></font>) ranted.
``We're both juniors,'' I corrected, though he (<font color='blue'><b>Charlie</b></font>) was more right than he (<font color='blue'><b>Charlie</b></font>) dreamed.
``Wait'' He (<font color='blue'><b>Charlie</b></font>) paused. ``Which one is Edwin?''
``Edward is the youngest, the one with the reddish brown hair.'' The beautiful one, the godlike one
``Oh, well, that's''  he (<font color='blue'><b>Charlie</b></font>) struggled  ``better, I guess. I don't like the look of that big one. I'm sure he (<font color='blue'><b>Edward</b></font>)'s a
nice boy and all, but he (<font color='blue'><b>Edward</b></font>) looks too mature for you. Is this Edwin your boyfriend?''
``It's Edward, Dad.''
``Is he (<font color='blue'><b>Dad</b></font>)?''
``Sort of, I guess.''
``You said last night that you weren't interested in any of the boys in town.'' But he (<font color='blue'><b>Charlie</b></font>) picked up his (<font color='blue'><b>Charlie</b></font>) fork
again, so I could see the worst was over.
<div class="bookquote">``Well, Edward doesn't live in town, Dad.''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>He (<font color='blue'><b>Charlie</b></font>) gave me a disparaging look as he (<font color='blue'><b>Charlie</b></font>) chewed.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``And, anyways,''  (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div>I continued, <div class="bookquote">``it's kind of at an early stage, you know. Don't embarrass me with all the
boyfriend talk, okay?''
 (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``When is he (<font color='blue'><b>boyfriend</b></font>) coming over?''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``He (<font color='blue'><b>boyfriend</b></font>)'ll be here in a few minutes.''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``Where is he (<font color='blue'><b>boyfriend</b></font>) taking you?''
 (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div>I groaned loudly. <div class="bookquote">``I hope you're getting the Spanish Inquisition out of your system now. We're going to
play baseball with his (<font color='blue'><b>boyfriend</b></font>) family.''
 (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>His (<font color='blue'><b>Charlie</b></font>) face puckered, and then he (<font color='blue'><b>Charlie</b></font>) finally chuckled. <div class="bookquote">``You're playing baseball?''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``Well, I'll probably watch most of the time.''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``You must really like this guy,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Charlie</b></font>) observed suspiciously.
I sighed and rolled my eyes for his (<font color='blue'><b>Charlie</b></font>) benefit.
I heard the roar of an engine pull up in front of the house. I jumped up and started cleaning my dishes.
<div class="bookquote">``Leave the dishes, I can do them tonight. You baby me too much.''
 (<font color='red'><b>Charlie</b></font>)</div>The doorbell rang, and Charlie stalked off to answer it. I was half a step behind him (<font color='blue'><b>Charlie</b></font>).
I hadn't realized how hard it was pouring outside. Edward stood in the halo of the porch light, looking
like a male model in an advertisement for raincoats.
<div class="bookquote">``Come on in, Edward.''
 (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div>I breathed a sigh of relief when Charlie got his (<font color='blue'><b>Charlie</b></font>) name right.
<div class="bookquote">``Thanks, Chief Swan,''  (<font color='red'><b>Edward/Edward Cullen/Cullen</b></font>)</div>Edward said in a respectful voice.
<div class="bookquote">``Go ahead and call me Charlie. Here, I'll take your jacket.''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``Thanks, sir.''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``Have a seat there, Edward.''
 (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div>I grimaced.
Edward sat down fluidly in the only chair, forcing me to sit next to Chief Swan on the sofa. I quickly shot
him (<font color='blue'><b>Edward</b></font>) a dirty look. He (<font color='blue'><b>Edward</b></font>) winked behind Charlie's back.
<div class="bookquote">``So I hear you're getting my girl to watch baseball.''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>Only in Washington would the fact that it was raining
buckets have no bearing at all on the playing of outdoor sports.
<div class="bookquote">``Yes, sir, that's the plan.''  (<font color='red'><b>He</b></font>)</div>He (<font color='blue'><b>Edward</b></font>) didn't look surprised that I'd told my father the truth. He (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) might have been
listening, though.
<div class="bookquote">``Well, more power to you, I guess.''
 (<font color='red'><b>Charlie</b></font>)</div>Charlie laughed, and Edward joined in.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Okay.''  (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div>I stood up. <div class="bookquote">``Enough humor at my expense. Let's go.''  (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div>I walked back to the hall and pulled on my
jacket. They followed.
<div class="bookquote">``Not too late, Bell.''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``Don't worry, Charlie, I'll have her (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) home early,''  (<font color='red'><b>Edward/Edward Cullen/Cullen</b></font>)</div>Edward promised.
<div class="bookquote">``You take care of my girl, all right?''
 (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div>I groaned, but they ignored me.
<div class="bookquote">``She (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>)'ll be safe with me, I promise, sir.''
 (<font color='red'><b>Charlie</b></font>)</div>Charlie couldn't doubt Edward's sincerity, it rang in every word.
I stalked out. They both laughed, and Edward followed me.
I stopped dead on the porch. There, behind my truck, was a monster Jeep. Its tires were higher than my
waist. There were metal guards over the headlights and tail-lights, and four large spotlights attached to the
crash bar. The hardtop was shiny red.
Charlie let out a low whistle.
<div class="bookquote">``Wear your seat belts,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Charlie</b></font>) choked out.
Edward followed me around to my side and opened the door. I gauged the distance to the seat and
prepared to jump for it. He (<font color='blue'><b>Edward</b></font>) sighed, and then lifted me in with one hand. I hoped Charlie didn't notice.
As he (<font color='blue'><b>Charlie</b></font>) went around to the driver's side, at a normal, human pace, I tried to put on my seat belt. But there
were too many buckles.
<div class="bookquote">``What's all this?''  (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div>I asked when he (<font color='blue'><b>Charlie</b></font>) opened the door.
<div class="bookquote">``It's an off-roading harness.''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``Uh-oh.''
 (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div>I tried to find the right places for all the buckles to fit, but it wasn't going too quickly. He (<font color='blue'><b>Charlie</b></font>) sighed again and
reached over to help me. I was glad that the rain was too heavy to see Charlie clearly on the porch. That
meant he (<font color='blue'><b>Charlie</b></font>) couldn't see how Edward's hands lingered at my neck, brushed along my collarbones. I gave up
trying to help him (<font color='blue'><b>Edward</b></font>) and focused on not hyperventilating.
Edward turned the key and the engine roared to life. We pulled away from the house.
<div class="bookquote">``This is a um big Jeep you have.''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``It's Emmett's. I didn't think you'd want to run the whole way.''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``Where do you keep this thing?''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``We remodeled one of the outbuildings into a garage.''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``Aren't you going to put on your seat belt?''
 (<font color='red'><b>He</b></font>)</div>He (<font color='blue'><b>Edward</b></font>) threw me a disbelieving look.

<p/>Then something sunk in.
<div class="bookquote">``Run the whole way? As in, we're still going to run part of the way?''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>My voice edged up a few octaves.
He (<font color='blue'><b>Edward</b></font>) grinned tightly. <div class="bookquote">``You're not going to run.''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``I'm going to be sick.''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``Keep your eyes closed, you'll be fine.''
 (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div>I bit my lip, fighting the panic.
He (<font color='blue'><b>Edward</b></font>) leaned over to kiss the top of my head, and then groaned. I looked at him (<font color='blue'><b>Edward</b></font>), puzzled.
<div class="bookquote">``You smell so good in the rain,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Edward</b></font>) explained.
<div class="bookquote">``In a good way, or in a bad way?''  (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div>I asked cautiously.
He (<font color='blue'><b>Edward</b></font>) sighed. <div class="bookquote">``Both, always both.''
 (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div>I don't know how he (<font color='blue'><b>Edward</b></font>) found his (<font color='blue'><b>Edward</b></font>) way in the gloom and downpour, but he (<font color='blue'><b>Edward</b></font>) somehow found a side road that
was less of a road and more of a mountain path. For a long while conversation was impossible, because I
was bouncing up and down on the seat like a jackhammer. He (<font color='blue'><b>Edward</b></font>) seemed to enjoy the ride, though, smiling
hugely the whole way.
And then we came to the end of the road; the trees formed green walls on three sides of the Jeep. The
rain was a mere drizzle, slowing every second, the sky brighter through the clouds.
<div class="bookquote">``Sorry, Bella, we have to go on foot from here.''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``You know what? I'll just wait here.''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``What happened to all your courage? You were extraordinary this morning.''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``I haven't forgotten the last time yet.''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>Could it have been only yesterday?
He (<font color='blue'><b>Edward</b></font>) was around to my side of the car in a blur. He (<font color='blue'><b>Edward</b></font>) started unbuckling me.
<div class="bookquote">``I'll get those, you go on ahead,''  (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div>I protested.
<div class="bookquote">``Hmmm''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Edward</b></font>) mused as he (<font color='blue'><b>Edward</b></font>) quickly finished. <div class="bookquote">``It seems I'm going to have to tamper with your memory.''
 (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div>Before I could react, he (<font color='blue'><b>Edward</b></font>) pulled me from the Jeep and set my feet on the ground. It was barely misting
now; Alice was going to be right.
<div class="bookquote">``Tamper with my memory?''  (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div>I asked nervously.
<div class="bookquote">``Something like that.''  (<font color='red'><b>He</b></font>)</div>He (<font color='blue'><b>Edward</b></font>) was watching me intently, carefully, but there was humor deep in his (<font color='blue'><b>Edward</b></font>) eyes. He (<font color='blue'><b>Edward</b></font>)
placed his (<font color='blue'><b>Edward</b></font>) hands against the Jeep on either side of my head and leaned forward, forcing me to press back
against the door. He (<font color='blue'><b>Edward</b></font>) leaned in even closer, his (<font color='blue'><b>Edward</b></font>) face inches from mine. I had no room to escape.
<div class="bookquote">``Now,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Edward</b></font>) breathed, and just his (<font color='blue'><b>Edward</b></font>) smell disturbed my thought processes, <div class="bookquote">``what exactly are you worrying
about?''
 (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``Well, um, hitting a tree ''  (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div>I gulped <div class="bookquote">'' and dying. And then getting sick.''

 (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div><p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Edward</b></font>) fought back a smile. Then he (<font color='blue'><b>Edward</b></font>) bent his (<font color='blue'><b>Edward</b></font>) head down and touched his (<font color='blue'><b>Edward</b></font>) cold lips softly to the hollow at the
base of my throat.
<div class="bookquote">``Are you still worried now?''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Edward</b></font>) murmured against my skin.
<div class="bookquote">``Yes.''  (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div>I struggled to concentrate. <div class="bookquote">``About hitting trees and getting sick.''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>His (<font color='blue'><b>Edward</b></font>) nose drew a line up the skin of my throat to the point of my chin. His (<font color='blue'><b>Edward</b></font>) cold breath tickled my skin.
<div class="bookquote">``And now?''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>His (<font color='blue'><b>Edward</b></font>) lips whispered against my jaw.
<div class="bookquote">``Trees,''  (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div>I gasped. <div class="bookquote">``Motion sickness.''
 (<font color='red'><b>He</b></font>)</div>He (<font color='blue'><b>Edward</b></font>) lifted his (<font color='blue'><b>Edward</b></font>) face to kiss my eyelids. <div class="bookquote">``Bella, you don't really think I would hit a tree, do you?''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``No, but I might.''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>There was no confidence in my voice. He (<font color='blue'><b>Edward</b></font>) smelled an easy victory.
He (<font color='blue'><b>Edward</b></font>) kissed slowly down my cheek, stopping just at the corner of my mouth.
<div class="bookquote">``Would I let a tree hurt you?''  (<font color='red'><b>lip</b></font>)</div>His (<font color='blue'><b>Edward</b></font>) lips barely brushed against my trembling lower lip.
<div class="bookquote">``No,''  (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div>I breathed. I knew there was a second part to my brilliant defense, but I couldn't quite call it back.
<div class="bookquote">``You see,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Edward</b></font>) said, his (<font color='blue'><b>Edward</b></font>) lips moving against mine. <div class="bookquote">``There's nothing to be afraid of, is there?''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``No,''  (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div>I sighed, giving up.
Then he (<font color='blue'><b>Edward</b></font>) took my face in his (<font color='blue'><b>Edward</b></font>) hands almost roughly, and kissed me in earnest, his (<font color='blue'><b>Edward</b></font>) unyielding lips moving
against mine.
There really was no excuse for my behavior. Obviously I knew better by now. And yet I couldn't seem
to stop from reacting exactly as I had the first time. Instead of keeping safely motionless, my arms
reached up to twine tightly around his (<font color='blue'><b>Edward</b></font>) neck, and I was suddenly welded to his (<font color='blue'><b>Edward</b></font>) stone figure. I sighed, and
my lips parted.
He (<font color='blue'><b>Edward</b></font>) staggered back, breaking my grip effortlessly.
<div class="bookquote">``Damn it, Bella!''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Edward</b></font>) broke off, gasping. <div class="bookquote">``You'll be the death of me, I swear you will.''
 (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div>I leaned over, bracing my hands against my knees for support.
<div class="bookquote">``You're indestructible,''  (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div>I mumbled, trying to catch my breath.
<div class="bookquote">``I might have believed that before I met you. Now let's get out of here before I do something really
stupid,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Edward</b></font>) growled.
He (<font color='blue'><b>Edward</b></font>) threw me across his (<font color='blue'><b>Edward</b></font>) back as he (<font color='blue'><b>Edward</b></font>) had before, and I could see the extra effort it took for him (<font color='blue'><b>Edward</b></font>) to be as
gentle as he (<font color='blue'><b>Edward</b></font>) was. I locked my legs around his (<font color='blue'><b>Edward</b></font>) waist and secured my arms in a choke hold around his (<font color='blue'><b>Edward</b></font>)
neck.
<div class="bookquote">``Don't forget to close your eyes,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Edward</b></font>) warned severely.
I quickly tucked my face into his (<font color='blue'><b>Edward</b></font>) shoulder blade, under my own arm, and squeezed my eyes shut.
And I could hardly tell we were moving. I could feel him (<font color='blue'><b>Edward</b></font>) gliding along beneath me, but he (<font color='blue'><b>Edward</b></font>) could have
been strolling down the sidewalk, the movement was so smooth. I was tempted to peek, just to see if he (<font color='blue'><b>Edward</b></font>)

<p/>was really flying through the forest like before, but I resisted. It wasn't worth that awful dizziness. I
contented myself with listening to his (<font color='blue'><b>Edward</b></font>) breath come and go evenly.
I wasn't quite sure we had stopped until he (<font color='blue'><b>Edward</b></font>) reached back and touched my hair.
<div class="bookquote">``It's over, Bella.''
 (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div>I dared to open my eyes, and, sure enough, we were at a standstill. I stiffly unlocked my stranglehold on
his (<font color='blue'><b>Edward</b></font>) body and slipped to the ground, landing on my backside.
<div class="bookquote">``Oh!''  (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div>I huffed as I hit the wet ground.
He (<font color='blue'><b>Edward</b></font>) stared at me incredulously, evidently not sure whether he (<font color='blue'><b>Edward</b></font>) was still too mad to find me funny. But my
bewildered expression pushed him (<font color='blue'><b>Edward</b></font>) over the edge, and he (<font color='blue'><b>Edward</b></font>) broke into a roar of laughter.
I picked myself up, ignoring him (<font color='blue'><b>Edward</b></font>) as I brushed the mud and bracken off the back of my jacket. That only
made him (<font color='blue'><b>Edward</b></font>) laugh harder. Annoyed, I began to stride off into the forest.
I felt his (<font color='blue'><b>Edward</b></font>) arm around my waist.
<div class="bookquote">``Where are you going, Bella?''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``To watch a baseball game. You don't seem to be interested in playing anymore, but I'm sure the others
will have fun without you.''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``You're going the wrong way.''
 (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div>I turned around without looking at him (<font color='blue'><b>Edward</b></font>), and stalked off in the opposite direction. He (<font color='blue'><b>Edward</b></font>) caught me again.
<div class="bookquote">``Don't be mad, I couldn't help myself. You should have seen your face.''  (<font color='red'><b>He</b></font>)</div>He (<font color='blue'><b>Edward</b></font>) chuckled before he (<font color='blue'><b>Edward</b></font>) could
stop himself.
<div class="bookquote">``Oh, you're the only one who's allowed to get mad?''  (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div>I asked, raising my eyebrows.
<div class="bookquote">``I wasn't mad at you.''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">''`Bella, you'll be the death of me'?''  (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div>I quoted sourly.
<div class="bookquote">``That was simply a statement of fact.''
 (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div>I tried to turn away from him (<font color='blue'><b>Edward</b></font>) again, but he (<font color='blue'><b>Edward</b></font>) held me fast.
<div class="bookquote">``You were mad,''  (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div>I insisted.
<div class="bookquote">``Yes.''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``But you just said ''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``That I wasn't mad at you. Can't you see that, Bella?''  (<font color='red'><b>He</b></font>)</div>He (<font color='blue'><b>Edward</b></font>) was suddenly intense, all trace of teasing gone.
<div class="bookquote">``Don't you understand?''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``See what?''  (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div>I demanded, confused by his (<font color='blue'><b>Edward</b></font>) sudden mood swing as much as his (<font color='blue'><b>Edward</b></font>) words.
<div class="bookquote">``I'm never angry with you  how could I be? Brave, trusting warm as you are.''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``Then why?''  (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div>I whispered, remembering the black moods that pulled him (<font color='blue'><b>Edward</b></font>) away from me, that I'd always

<p/>interpreted as well-justified frustration  frustration at my weakness, my slowness, my unruly human
reactions
He (<font color='blue'><b>Edward</b></font>) put his (<font color='blue'><b>Edward</b></font>) hands carefully on both sides of my face. <div class="bookquote">``I infuriate myself,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Edward</b></font>) said gently. <div class="bookquote">``The way I can't
seem to keep from putting you in danger. My very existence puts you at risk. Sometimes I truly hate
myself. I should be stronger, I should be able to ''
 (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div>I placed my hand over his (<font color='blue'><b>Edward</b></font>) mouth. <div class="bookquote">``Don't.''
 (<font color='red'><b>He</b></font>)</div>He (<font color='blue'><b>Edward</b></font>) took my hand, moving it from his (<font color='blue'><b>Edward</b></font>) lips, but holding it to his (<font color='blue'><b>Edward</b></font>) face.
<div class="bookquote">``I love you,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Edward</b></font>) said. <div class="bookquote">``It's a poor excuse for what I'm doing, but it's still true.''
 (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>It was the first time he (<font color='blue'><b>Edward</b></font>)'d said he (<font color='blue'><b>Edward</b></font>) loved me  in so many words. He (<font color='blue'><b>Edward</b></font>) might not realize it, but I certainly
did.
<div class="bookquote">``Now, please try to behave yourself,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Edward</b></font>) continued, and he (<font color='blue'><b>Edward</b></font>) bent to softly brush his (<font color='blue'><b>Edward</b></font>) lips against mine.
I held properly still. Then I sighed.
<div class="bookquote">``You promised Chief Swan that you would have me home early, remember? We'd better get going.''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``Yes, ma'am.''
 (<font color='red'><b>He</b></font>)</div>He (<font color='blue'><b>Edward</b></font>) smiled wistfully and released all of me but one hand. He (<font color='blue'><b>Edward</b></font>) led me a few feet through the tall, wet ferns
and draping moss, around a massive hemlock tree, and we were there, on the edge of an enormous open
field in the lap of the Olympic peaks. It was twice the size of any baseball stadium.
I could see the others all there; Esme, Emmett, and Rosalie, sitting on a bare outcropping of rock, were
the closest to us, maybe a hundred yards away. Much farther out I could see Jasper and Alice, at least a
quarter of a mile apart, appearing to throw something back and forth, but I never saw any ball. It looked
like Carlisle was marking bases, but could they really be that far apart?
When we came into view, the three on the rocks rose.
Esme started toward us. Emmett followed after a long look at Rosalie's back; Rosalie had risen gracefully
and strode off toward the field without a glance in our direction. My stomach quivered uneasily in
response.
<div class="bookquote">``Was that you we heard, Edward?''  (<font color='red'><b>Esme</b></font>)</div>Esme asked as she (<font color='blue'><b>Rosalie</b></font>) approached.
<div class="bookquote">``It sounded like a bear choking,''  (<font color='red'><b>Emmett</b></font>)</div>Emmett clarified.
I smiled hesitantly at Esme. <div class="bookquote">``That was him (<font color='blue'><b>Edward</b></font>).''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``Bella was being unintentionally funny,''  (<font color='red'><b>Edward/Edward Cullen/Cullen</b></font>)</div>Edward explained, quickly settling the score.
Alice had left her (<font color='blue'><b>Alice</b></font>) position and was running, or dancing, toward us. She (<font color='blue'><b>Alice</b></font>) hurtled to a fluid stop at our feet.
<div class="bookquote">``It's time,''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Alice</b></font>) announced.
As soon as she (<font color='blue'><b>Alice</b></font>) spoke, a deep rumble of thunder shook the forest beyond us, and then crashed westward
toward town.
<div class="bookquote">``Eerie, isn't it?''  (<font color='red'><b>Emmett</b></font>)</div>Emmett said with easy familiarity, winking at me.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Let's go.''  (<font color='red'><b>Alice</b></font>)</div>Alice reached for Emmett's hand and they darted toward the oversized field; she (<font color='blue'><b>Alice</b></font>) ran like a
gazelle. He (<font color='blue'><b>Emmett</b></font>) was nearly as graceful and just as fast  yet Emmett could never be compared to a gazelle.
<div class="bookquote">``Are you ready for some ball?''  (<font color='red'><b>Edward/Edward Cullen/Cullen</b></font>)</div>Edward asked, his (<font color='blue'><b>Edward</b></font>) eyes eager, bright.
I tried to sound appropriately enthusiastic. <div class="bookquote">``Go team!''
 (<font color='red'><b>He</b></font>)</div>He (<font color='blue'><b>Edward</b></font>) snickered and, after mussing my hair, bounded off after the other two. His (<font color='blue'><b>Edward</b></font>) run was more aggressive, a
cheetah rather than a gazelle, and he (<font color='blue'><b>Edward</b></font>) quickly overtook them. The grace and power took my breath away.
<div class="bookquote">``Shall we go down?''  (<font color='red'><b>Esme</b></font>)</div>Esme asked in her (<font color='blue'><b>Alice</b></font>) soft, melodic voice, and I realized I was staring openmouthed
after him (<font color='blue'><b>Edward</b></font>). I quickly reassembled my expression and nodded. Esme kept a few feet between us, and I
wondered if she (<font color='blue'><b>Alice</b></font>) was still being careful not to frighten me. She (<font color='blue'><b>Alice</b></font>) matched her (<font color='blue'><b>Alice</b></font>) stride to mine without seeming
impatient at the pace.
<div class="bookquote">``You don't play with them?''  (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div>I asked shyly.
<div class="bookquote">``No, I prefer to referee  I like keeping them honest,''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Alice</b></font>) explained.
<div class="bookquote">``Do they like to cheat, then?''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``Oh yes  you should hear the arguments they get into! Actually, I hope you don't, you would think they
were raised by a pack of wolves.''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``You sound like my mom,''  (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div>I laughed, surprised.
She (<font color='blue'><b>Alice</b></font>) laughed, too. <div class="bookquote">``Well, I do think of them as my children in most ways. I never could get over my
mothering instincts  did Edward tell you I had lost a child?''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``No,''  (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div>I murmured, stunned, scrambling to understand what lifetime she (<font color='blue'><b>Alice</b></font>) was remembering.
<div class="bookquote">``Yes, my first and only baby. He (<font color='blue'><b>Edward</b></font>) died just a few days after he (<font color='blue'><b>Edward</b></font>) was born, the poor tiny thing,''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Alice</b></font>) sighed.
<div class="bookquote">``It broke my heart  that's why I jumped off the cliff, you know,''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Alice</b></font>) added matter-of-factly.
<div class="bookquote">``Edward just said you f-fell,''  (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div>I stammered.
<div class="bookquote">``Always the gentleman.''  (<font color='red'><b>She</b></font>)</div>She (<font color='blue'><b>Alice</b></font>) smiled. <div class="bookquote">``Edward was the first of my new sons. I've always thought of him (<font color='blue'><b>Edward</b></font>)
that way, even though he (<font color='blue'><b>Edward</b></font>)'s older than I, in one way at least.''  (<font color='red'><b>She</b></font>)</div>She (<font color='blue'><b>Alice</b></font>) smiled at me warmly. <div class="bookquote">``That's why I'm
so happy that he (<font color='blue'><b>Edward</b></font>)'s found you, dear.''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>The endearment sounded very natural on her (<font color='blue'><b>Alice</b></font>) lips. <div class="bookquote">``He (<font color='blue'><b>Edward</b></font>)'s been the
odd man out for far too long; it's hurt me to see him (<font color='blue'><b>Edward</b></font>) alone.''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``You don't mind, then?''  (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div>I asked, hesitant again. <div class="bookquote">``That I'm all wrong for him (<font color='blue'><b>Edward</b></font>)?''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``No.''  (<font color='red'><b>She</b></font>)</div>She (<font color='blue'><b>Alice</b></font>) was thoughtful. <div class="bookquote">``You're what he (<font color='blue'><b>Edward</b></font>) wants. It will work out, somehow,''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Alice</b></font>) said, though her (<font color='blue'><b>Alice</b></font>)
forehead creased with worry. Another peal of thunder began.
Esme stopped then; apparently, we'd reached the edge of the field. It looked as if they had formed
teams. Edward was far out in left field, Carlisle stood between the first and second bases, and Alice held
the ball, positioned on the spot that must be the pitcher's mound.
Emmett was swinging an aluminum bat; it whistled almost untraceably through the air. I waited for him (<font color='blue'><b>Emmett</b></font>) to
approach home plate, but then I realized, as he (<font color='blue'><b>Emmett</b></font>) took his (<font color='blue'><b>Emmett</b></font>) stance, that he (<font color='blue'><b>Emmett</b></font>) was already there  farther from
the pitcher's mound than I would have thought possible. Jasper stood several feet behind him (<font color='blue'><b>Jasper</b></font>), catching
for the other team. Of course, none of them had gloves.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``All right,''  (<font color='red'><b>Esme</b></font>)</div>Esme called in a clear voice, which I knew even Edward would hear, as far out as he (<font color='blue'><b>Edward</b></font>) was.
<div class="bookquote">``Batter up.''
 (<font color='red'><b>Alice</b></font>)</div>Alice stood straight, deceptively motionless. Her (<font color='blue'><b>Alice</b></font>) style seemed to be stealth rather than an intimidating
windup. She (<font color='blue'><b>Alice</b></font>) held the ball in both hands at her (<font color='blue'><b>Alice</b></font>) waist, and then, like the strike of a cobra, her (<font color='blue'><b>Alice</b></font>) right hand
flicked out and the ball smacked into Jasper's hand.
<div class="bookquote">``Was that a strike?''  (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div>I whispered to Esme.
<div class="bookquote">``If they don't hit it, it's a strike,''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Alice</b></font>) told me.
Jasper hurled the ball back to Alice's waiting hand. She (<font color='blue'><b>Alice</b></font>) permitted herself a brief grin. And then her (<font color='blue'><b>Alice</b></font>) hand
spun out again.
This time the bat somehow made it around in time to smash into the invisible ball. The crack of impact
was shattering, thunderous; it echoed off the mountains  I immediately understood the necessity of the
thunderstorm.
The ball shot like a meteor above the field, flying deep into the surrounding forest.
<div class="bookquote">``Home run,''  (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div>I murmured.
<div class="bookquote">``Wait,''  (<font color='red'><b>Esme</b></font>)</div>Esme cautioned, listening intently, one hand raised. Emmett was a blur around the bases, Carlisle
shadowing him (<font color='blue'><b>Carlisle</b></font>). I realized Edward was missing.
<div class="bookquote">``Out!''  (<font color='red'><b>Esme</b></font>)</div>Esme cried in a clear voice. I stared in disbelief as Edward sprang from the fringe of the trees, ball
in his (<font color='blue'><b>Edward</b></font>) upraised hand, his (<font color='blue'><b>Edward</b></font>) wide grin visible even to me.
<div class="bookquote">``Emmett hits the hardest,''  (<font color='red'><b>Esme</b></font>)</div>Esme explained, <div class="bookquote">``but Edward runs the fastest.''
 (<font color='red'><b>Esme</b></font>)</div>The inning continued before my incredulous eyes. It was impossible to keep up with the speed at which
the ball flew, the rate at which their bodies raced around the field.
I learned the other reason they waited for a thunderstorm to play when Jasper, trying to avoid Edward's
infallible fielding, hit a ground ball toward Carlisle. Carlisle ran into the ball, and then raced Jasper to first
base. When they collided, the sound was like the crash of two massive falling boulders. I jumped up in
concern, but they were somehow unscathed.
<div class="bookquote">``Safe,''  (<font color='red'><b>Esme</b></font>)</div>Esme called in a calm voice.
Emmett's team was up by one  Rosalie managed to flit around the bases after tagging up on one of
Emmett's long flies  when Edward caught the third out. He (<font color='blue'><b>Edward</b></font>) sprinted to my side, sparkling with
excitement.
<div class="bookquote">``What do you think?''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Edward</b></font>) asked.
<div class="bookquote">``One thing's for sure, I'll never be able to sit through dull old Major League Baseball again.''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``And it sounds like you did so much of that before,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Edward</b></font>) laughed.
<div class="bookquote">``I am a little disappointed,''  (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div>I teased.
<div class="bookquote">``Why?''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Edward</b></font>) asked, puzzled.
<div class="bookquote">``Well, it would be nice if I could find just one thing you didn't do better than everyone else on the planet.''

 (<font color='red'><b>He</b></font>)</div><p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Edward</b></font>) flashed his (<font color='blue'><b>Edward</b></font>) special crooked smile, leaving me breathless.
<div class="bookquote">``I'm up,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Edward</b></font>) said, heading for the plate.
He (<font color='blue'><b>Edward</b></font>) played intelligently, keeping the ball low, out of the reach of Rosalie's always-ready hand in the
outfield, gaining two bases like lightning before Emmett could get the ball back in play. Carlisle knocked
one so far out of the field  with a boom that hurt my ears  that he (<font color='blue'><b>Carlisle</b></font>) and Edward both made it in. Alice
slapped them dainty high fives.
The score constantly changed as the game continued, and they razzed each other like any street
ballplayers as they took turns with the lead. Occasionally Esme would call them to order. The thunder
rumbled on, but we stayed dry, as Alice had predicted.
Carlisle was up to bat, Edward catching, when Alice suddenly gasped. My eyes were on Edward, as
usual, and I saw his (<font color='blue'><b>Edward</b></font>) head snap up to look at her (<font color='blue'><b>Alice</b></font>). Their eyes met and something flowed between them in
an instant. He (<font color='blue'><b>Edward</b></font>) was at my side before the others could ask Alice what was wrong.
<div class="bookquote">``Alice?''  (<font color='red'><b>Esme</b></font>)</div>Esme's voice was tense.
<div class="bookquote">``I didn't see  I couldn't tell,''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Alice</b></font>) whispered.
All the others were gathered by this time.
<div class="bookquote">``What is it, Alice?''  (<font color='red'><b>Carlisle</b></font>)</div>Carlisle asked with the calm voice of authority.
<div class="bookquote">``They were traveling much quicker than I thought. I can see I had the perspective wrong before,''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Alice</b></font>)
murmured.
Jasper leaned over her (<font color='blue'><b>Alice</b></font>), his (<font color='blue'><b>Jasper</b></font>) posture protective. <div class="bookquote">``What changed?''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Jasper</b></font>) asked.
<div class="bookquote">``They heard us playing, and it changed their path,''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Alice</b></font>) said, contrite, as if she (<font color='blue'><b>Alice</b></font>) felt responsible for
whatever had frightened her (<font color='blue'><b>Alice</b></font>).
Seven pairs of quick eyes flashed to my face and away.
<div class="bookquote">``How soon?''  (<font color='red'><b>Carlisle</b></font>)</div>Carlisle said, turning toward Edward.
A look of intense concentration crossed his (<font color='blue'><b>Edward</b></font>) face.
<div class="bookquote">``Less than five minutes. They're running  they want to play.''  (<font color='red'><b>He</b></font>)</div>He (<font color='blue'><b>Edward</b></font>) scowled.
<div class="bookquote">``Can you make it?''  (<font color='red'><b>Carlisle</b></font>)</div>Carlisle asked him (<font color='blue'><b>Carlisle</b></font>), his (<font color='blue'><b>Carlisle</b></font>) eyes flicking toward me again.
<div class="bookquote">``No, not carrying ''  (<font color='red'><b>He</b></font>)</div>He (<font color='blue'><b>Carlisle</b></font>) cut short. <div class="bookquote">``Besides, the last thing we need is for them to catch the scent and
start hunting.''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``How many?''  (<font color='red'><b>Emmett</b></font>)</div>Emmett asked Alice.
<div class="bookquote">``Three,''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Alice</b></font>) answered tersely.
<div class="bookquote">``Three!''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Emmett</b></font>) scoffed. <div class="bookquote">``Let them come.''  (<font color='red'><b>The steel bands</b></font>)</div>The steel bands of muscle flexed along his (<font color='blue'><b>Emmett</b></font>) massive arms.
For a split second that seemed much longer than it really was, Carlisle deliberated. Only Emmett seemed
unperturbed; the rest stared at Carlisle's face with anxious eyes.
<div class="bookquote">``Let's just continue the game,''  (<font color='red'><b>Carlisle</b></font>)</div>Carlisle finally decided. His (<font color='blue'><b>Carlisle</b></font>) voice was cool and level. ``Alice said they

<p/>were simply curious.''
All this was said in a flurry of words that lasted only a few seconds. I had listened carefully and caught
most of it, though I couldn't hear what Esme now asked Edward with a silent vibration of her (<font color='blue'><b>Alice</b></font>) lips. I only
saw the slight shake of his (<font color='blue'><b>Edward</b></font>) head and the look of relief on her (<font color='blue'><b>Alice</b></font>) face.
``You catch, Esme,'' he (<font color='blue'><b>Edward</b></font>) said. ``I'll call it now.'' And he (<font color='blue'><b>Edward</b></font>) planted himself in front of me.
The others returned to the field, warily sweeping the dark forest with their sharp eyes. Alice and Esme
seemed to orient themselves around where I stood.
``Take your hair down,'' Edward said in a low, even voice.
I obediently slid the rubber band out of my hair and shook it out around me.
I stated the obvious. ``The others are coming now.''
``Yes, stay very still, keep quiet, and don't move from my side, please.'' He (<font color='blue'><b>Edward</b></font>) hid the stress in his (<font color='blue'><b>Edward</b></font>) voice well,
but I could hear it. He (<font color='blue'><b>Edward</b></font>) pulled my long hair forward, around my face.
``That won't help,'' Alice said softly. ``I could smell her (<font color='blue'><b>Alice</b></font>) across the field.''
``I know.'' A hint of frustration colored his (<font color='blue'><b>Edward</b></font>) tone.
Carlisle stood at the plate, and the others joined the game halfheartedly.
``What did Esme ask you?'' I whispered.
He (<font color='blue'><b>Carlisle</b></font>) hesitated for a second before he (<font color='blue'><b>Carlisle</b></font>) answered. ``Whether they were thirsty,'' he (<font color='blue'><b>Carlisle</b></font>) muttered unwillingly.
The seconds ticked by; the game progressed with apathy now. No one dared to hit harder than a bunt,
and Emmett, Rosalie, and Jasper hovered in the infield. Now and again, despite the fear that numbed my
brain, I was aware of Rosalie's eyes on me. They were expressionless, but something about the way she (<font color='blue'><b>Rosalie</b></font>)
held her (<font color='blue'><b>Rosalie</b></font>) mouth made me think she (<font color='blue'><b>Rosalie</b></font>) was angry.
Edward paid no attention to the game at all, eyes and mind ranging the forest.
``I'm sorry, Bella,'' he (<font color='blue'><b>Edward</b></font>) muttered fiercely. <div class="bookquote">``It was stupid, irresponsible, to expose you like this. I'm so
sorry.''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>I heard his (<font color='blue'><b>Edward</b></font>) breath stop, and his (<font color='blue'><b>Edward</b></font>) eyes zeroed in on right field. He (<font color='blue'><b>Edward</b></font>) took a half step, angling himself between
me and what was coming.
Carlisle, Emmett, and the others turned in the same direction, hearing sounds of passage much too faint
for my ears.

<p/>18. THE HUNT

<p/>They emerged one by one from the forest edge, ranging a dozen meters apart. The first male into the
clearing fell back immediately, allowing the other male to take the front, orienting himself around the tall,
dark-haired man in a manner that clearly displayed who led the pack. The third was a woman; from this
distance, all I could see of her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) was that her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) hair was a startling shade of red.

<p/>They closed ranks before they continued cautiously toward Edward's family, exhibiting the natural
respect of a troop of predators as it encounters a larger, unfamiliar group of its own kind.
As they approached, I could see how different they were from the Cullens. Their walk was catlike, a gait
that seemed constantly on the edge of shifting into a crouch. They dressed in the ordinary gear of
backpackers: jeans and casual button-down shirts in heavy, weatherproof fabrics. The clothes were
frayed, though, with wear, and they were barefoot. Both men had cropped hair, but the woman's brilliant
orange hair was filled with leaves and debris from the woods.
Their sharp eyes carefully took in the more polished, urbane stance of Carlisle, who, flanked by Emmett
and Jasper, stepped guardedly forward to meet them. Without any seeming communication between
them, they each straightened into a more casual, erect bearing.
The man in front was easily the most beautiful, his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) skin olive-toned beneath the typical pallor, his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) hair a
glossy black. He (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) was of a medium build, hard-muscled, of course, but nothing next to Emmett's brawn.
He (<font color='blue'><b>Emmett</b></font>) smiled an easy smile, exposing a flash of gleaming white teeth.
The woman was wilder, her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) eyes shifting restlessly between the men facing her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>), and the loose grouping
around me, her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) chaotic hair quivering in the slight breeze. Her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) posture was distinctly feline. The second
male hovered unobtrusively behind them, slighter than the leader, his (<font color='blue'><b>leader</b></font>) light brown hair and regular features
both nondescript. His (<font color='blue'><b>leader</b></font>) eyes, though completely still, somehow seemed the most vigilant.
Their eyes were different, too. Not the gold or black I had come to expect, but a deep burgundy color
that was disturbing and sinister.
The dark-haired man, still smiling, stepped toward Carlisle.
<div class="bookquote">``We thought we heard a game,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) said in a relaxed voice with the slightest of French accents. <div class="bookquote">``I'm
Laurent, these are Victoria and James.''  (<font color='red'><b>He</b></font>)</div>He (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) gestured to the vampires beside him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>).
<div class="bookquote">``I'm Carlisle. This is my family, Emmett and Jasper, Rosalie, Esme and Alice, Edward and Bella.''  (<font color='red'><b>He</b></font>)</div>He (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>)
pointed us out in groups, deliberately not calling attention to individuals. I felt a shock when he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) said my
name.
<div class="bookquote">``Do you have room for a few more players?''  (<font color='red'><b>Laurent</b></font>)</div>Laurent asked sociably.
Carlisle matched Laurent's friendly tone. <div class="bookquote">``Actually, we were just finishing up. But we'd certainly be
interested another time. Are you planning to stay in the area for long?''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``We're headed north, in fact, but we were curious to see who was in the neighborhood. We haven't run
into any company in a long time.''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``No, this region is usually empty except for us and the occasional visitor, like yourselves.''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>The tense atmosphere had slowly subsided into a casual conversation; I guessed that Jasper was using his (<font color='blue'><b>Jasper</b></font>)
peculiar gift to control the situation.
<div class="bookquote">``What's your hunting range?''  (<font color='red'><b>Laurent</b></font>)</div>Laurent casually inquired.
Carlisle ignored the assumption behind the inquiry. <div class="bookquote">``The Olympic Range here, up and down the Coast
Ranges on occasion. We keep a permanent residence nearby. There's another permanent settlement like
ours up near Denali.''
 (<font color='red'><b>Laurent</b></font>)</div>Laurent rocked back on his (<font color='blue'><b>Laurent</b></font>) heels slightly.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Permanent? How do you manage that?''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>There was honest curiosity in his (<font color='blue'><b>Laurent</b></font>) voice.
<div class="bookquote">``Why don't you come back to our home with us and we can talk comfortably?''  (<font color='red'><b>Carlisle</b></font>)</div>Carlisle invited. <div class="bookquote">``It's a
rather long story.''
 (<font color='red'><b>James</b></font>)</div>James and Victoria exchanged a surprised look at the mention of the word <div class="bookquote">``home,''  (<font color='red'><b>Victoria</b></font>)</div>but Laurent
controlled his (<font color='blue'><b>Laurent</b></font>) expression better.
<div class="bookquote">``That sounds very interesting, and welcome.''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>His (<font color='blue'><b>Laurent</b></font>) smile was genial. <div class="bookquote">``We've been on the hunt all the way
down from Ontario, and we haven't had the chance to clean up in a while.''  (<font color='red'><b>Carlisle</b></font>)</div>His (<font color='blue'><b>Laurent</b></font>) eyes moved
appreciatively over Carlisle's refined appearance.
<div class="bookquote">``Please don't take offense, but we'd appreciate it if you'd refrain from hunting in this immediate area. We
have to stay inconspicuous, you understand,''  (<font color='red'><b>Carlisle</b></font>)</div>Carlisle explained.
<div class="bookquote">``Of course.''  (<font color='red'><b>Laurent</b></font>)</div>Laurent nodded. <div class="bookquote">``We certainly won't encroach on your territory. We just ate outside of
Seattle, anyway,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Laurent</b></font>) laughed. A shiver ran up my spine.
<div class="bookquote">``We'll show you the way if you'd like to run with us  Emmett and Alice, you can go with Edward and
Bella to get the Jeep,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Laurent</b></font>) casually added.
Three things seemed to happen simultaneously while Carlisle was speaking. My hair ruffled with the light
breeze, Edward stiffened, and the second male, James, suddenly whipped his (<font color='blue'><b>James</b></font>) head around, scrutinizing
me, his (<font color='blue'><b>James</b></font>) nostrils flaring.
A swift rigidity fell on all of them as James lurched one step forward into a crouch. Edward bared his (<font color='blue'><b>Edward</b></font>)
teeth, crouching in defense, a feral snarl ripping from his (<font color='blue'><b>Edward</b></font>) throat.
It was nothing like the playful sounds I'd heard from him (<font color='blue'><b>Edward</b></font>) this morning; it was the single most menacing
thing I had ever heard, and chills ran from the crown of my head to the back of my heels.
<div class="bookquote">``What's this?''  (<font color='red'><b>Laurent</b></font>)</div>Laurent exclaimed in open surprise. Neither James nor Edward relaxed their aggressive
poses. James feinted slightly to the side, and Edward shifted in response.
<div class="bookquote">``She (<font color='blue'><b>Bella</b></font>)'s with us.''  (<font color='red'><b>Carlisle</b></font>)</div>Carlisle's firm rebuff was directed toward James. Laurent seemed to catch my scent less
powerfully than James, but awareness now dawned on his (<font color='blue'><b>James</b></font>) face.
<div class="bookquote">``You brought a snack?''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>James</b></font>) asked, his (<font color='blue'><b>James</b></font>) expression incredulous as he (<font color='blue'><b>James</b></font>) took an involuntary step forward.
Edward snarled even more ferociously, harshly, his (<font color='blue'><b>Edward</b></font>) lip curling high above his (<font color='blue'><b>Edward</b></font>) glistening, bared teeth.
Laurent stepped back again.
<div class="bookquote">``I said she (<font color='blue'><b>Bella</b></font>)'s with us,''  (<font color='red'><b>Carlisle</b></font>)</div>Carlisle corrected in a hard voice.
<div class="bookquote">``But she (<font color='blue'><b>Bella</b></font>)'s human,''  (<font color='red'><b>Laurent</b></font>)</div>Laurent protested. The words were not at all aggressive, merely astounded.
<div class="bookquote">``Yes.''  (<font color='red'><b>Emmett</b></font>)</div>Emmett was very much in evidence at Carlisle's side, his (<font color='blue'><b>Carlisle</b></font>) eyes on James. James slowly
straightened out of his (<font color='blue'><b>James</b></font>) crouch, but his (<font color='blue'><b>James</b></font>) eyes never left me, his (<font color='blue'><b>James</b></font>) nostrils still wide. Edward stayed tensed like
a lion in front of me.
When Laurent spoke, his (<font color='blue'><b>Laurent</b></font>) tone was soothing  trying to defuse the sudden hostility. <div class="bookquote">``It appears we have
a lot to learn about each other.''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``Indeed.''  (<font color='red'><b>Carlisle</b></font>)</div>Carlisle's voice was still cool.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``But we'd like to accept your invitation.''  (<font color='red'><b>me</b></font>)</div>His (<font color='blue'><b>Carlisle</b></font>) eyes flicked toward me and back to Carlisle. <div class="bookquote">``And, of
course, we will not harm the human girl. We won't hunt in your range, as I said.''
 (<font color='red'><b>James</b></font>)</div>James glanced in disbelief and aggravation at Laurent and exchanged another brief look with Victoria,
whose eyes still flickered edgily from face to face.
Carlisle measured Laurent's open expression for a moment before he (<font color='blue'><b>Carlisle</b></font>) spoke. <div class="bookquote">``We'll show you the way.
Jasper, Rosalie, Esme?''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Carlisle</b></font>) called. They gathered together, blocking me from view as they converged.
Alice was instantly at my side, and Emmett fell back slowly, his (<font color='blue'><b>Emmett</b></font>) eyes locked on James as he (<font color='blue'><b>James</b></font>) backed
toward us.
<div class="bookquote">``Let's go, Bella.''  (<font color='red'><b>Edward/Edward Cullen/Cullen</b></font>)</div>Edward's voice was low and bleak.
This whole time I'd been rooted in place, terrified into absolute immobility. Edward had to grip my elbow
and pull sharply to break my trance. Alice and Emmett were close behind us, hiding me. I stumbled
alongside Edward, still stunned with fear. I couldn't hear if the main group had left yet. Edward's
impatience was almost tangible as we moved at human speed to the forest edge.
Once we were into the trees, Edward slung me over his (<font color='blue'><b>Edward</b></font>) back without breaking stride. I gripped as tightly
as possible as he (<font color='blue'><b>Edward</b></font>) took off, the others close on his (<font color='blue'><b>Edward</b></font>) heels. I kept my head down, but my eyes, wide with
fright, wouldn't close. They plunged through the now-black forest like wraiths. The sense of exhilaration
that usually seemed to possess Edward as he (<font color='blue'><b>Edward</b></font>) ran was completely absent, replaced by a fury that
consumed him (<font color='blue'><b>Edward</b></font>) and drove him (<font color='blue'><b>Edward</b></font>) still faster. Even with me on his (<font color='blue'><b>Edward</b></font>) back, the others trailed behind.
We reached the Jeep in an impossibly short time, and Edward barely slowed as he (<font color='blue'><b>Edward</b></font>) flung me in the
backseat.
<div class="bookquote">``Strap her (<font color='blue'><b>Bella</b></font>) in,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Edward</b></font>) ordered Emmett, who slid in beside me.
Alice was already in the front seat, and Edward was starting the engine. It roared to life and we swerved
backward, spinning around to face the winding road.
Edward was growling something too fast for me to understand, but it sounded a lot like a string of
profanities.
The jolting trip was much worse this time, and the darkness only made it more frightening. Emmett and
Alice both glared out the side windows.
We hit the main road, and though our speed increased, I could see much better where we were going.
And we were headed south, away from Forks.
<div class="bookquote">``Where are we going?''  (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div>I asked.
No one answered. No one even looked at me.
<div class="bookquote">``Dammit, Edward! Where are you taking me?''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``We have to get you away from here  far away  now.''  (<font color='red'><b>He</b></font>)</div>He (<font color='blue'><b>Emmett</b></font>) didn't look back, his (<font color='blue'><b>Emmett</b></font>) eyes on the road.
The speedometer read a hundred and five miles an hour.
<div class="bookquote">``Turn around! You have to take me home!''  (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div>I shouted. I struggled with the stupid harness, tearing at the
straps.
<div class="bookquote">``Emmett,''  (<font color='red'><b>Edward/Edward Cullen/Cullen</b></font>)</div>Edward said grimly.

<p/>And Emmett secured my hands in his (<font color='blue'><b>Emmett</b></font>) steely grasp.
<div class="bookquote">``No! Edward! No, you can't do this.''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``I have to, Bella, now please be quiet.''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``I won't! You have to take me back  Charlie will call the FBI! They'll be all over your family 
Carlisle and Esme! They'll have to leave, to hide forever!''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``Calm down, Bella.''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>His (<font color='blue'><b>Emmett</b></font>) voice was cold. <div class="bookquote">``We've been there before.''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``Not over me, you don't! You're not ruining everything over me!''  (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div>I struggled violently, with total futility.
Alice spoke for the first time. <div class="bookquote">``Edward, pull over.''
 (<font color='red'><b>He</b></font>)</div>He (<font color='blue'><b>Emmett</b></font>) flashed her (<font color='blue'><b>Alice</b></font>) a hard look, and then sped up.
<div class="bookquote">``Edward, let's just talk this through.''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``You don't understand,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Emmett</b></font>) roared in frustration. I'd never heard his (<font color='blue'><b>Emmett</b></font>) voice so loud; it was deafening in the
confines of the Jeep. The speedometer neared one hundred and fifteen. <div class="bookquote">``He (<font color='blue'><b>Edward</b></font>)'s a tracker, Alice, did you
see that? He (<font color='blue'><b>Edward</b></font>)'s a tracker!''
 (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div>I felt Emmett stiffen next to me, and I wondered at his (<font color='blue'><b>Emmett</b></font>) reaction to the word. It meant something more to
the three of them than it did to me; I wanted to understand, but there was no opening for me to ask.
<div class="bookquote">``Pull over, Edward.''  (<font color='red'><b>Alice</b></font>)</div>Alice's tone was reasonable, but there was a ring of authority in it I'd never heard
before.
The speedometer inched passed one-twenty.
<div class="bookquote">``Do it, Edward.''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``Listen to me, Alice. I saw his (<font color='blue'><b>Edward</b></font>) mind. Tracking is his (<font color='blue'><b>Edward</b></font>) passion, his (<font color='blue'><b>Edward</b></font>) obsession  and he (<font color='blue'><b>Edward</b></font>) wants her (<font color='blue'><b>Alice</b></font>), Alice 
her (<font color='blue'><b>Alice</b></font>), specifically. He (<font color='blue'><b>Edward</b></font>) begins the hunt tonight.''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``He (<font color='blue'><b>Edward</b></font>) doesn't know where ''
 (<font color='red'><b>He</b></font>)</div>He (<font color='blue'><b>Emmett</b></font>) interrupted her (<font color='blue'><b>Alice</b></font>). <div class="bookquote">``How long do you think it will take him (<font color='blue'><b>Edward</b></font>) to cross her (<font color='blue'><b>Alice</b></font>) scent in town? His (<font color='blue'><b>Edward</b></font>) plan was
already set before the words were out of Laurent's mouth.''
 (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div>I gasped, knowing where my scent would lead. <div class="bookquote">``Charlie! You can't leave him (<font color='blue'><b>Charlie</b></font>) there! You can't leave
him (<font color='blue'><b>Charlie</b></font>)!''  (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div>I thrashed against the harness.
<div class="bookquote">``She (<font color='blue'><b>Alice</b></font>)'s right,''  (<font color='red'><b>Alice</b></font>)</div>Alice said.
The car slowed slightly.
<div class="bookquote">``Let's just look at our options for a minute,''  (<font color='red'><b>Alice</b></font>)</div>Alice coaxed.
The car slowed again, more noticeably, and then suddenly we screeched to a stop on the shoulder of the
highway. I flew against the harness, and then slammed back into the seat.
<div class="bookquote">``There are no options,''  (<font color='red'><b>Edward/Edward Cullen/Cullen</b></font>)</div>Edward hissed.
<div class="bookquote">``I'm not leaving Charlie!''  (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div>I yelled.

<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Edward</b></font>) ignored me completely.
<div class="bookquote">``We have to take her (<font color='blue'><b>Alice</b></font>) back,''  (<font color='red'><b>Emmett</b></font>)</div>Emmett finally spoke.
<div class="bookquote">``No.''  (<font color='red'><b>Edward/Edward Cullen/Cullen</b></font>)</div>Edward was absolute.
<div class="bookquote">``He (<font color='blue'><b>Charlie</b></font>)'s no match for us, Edward. He (<font color='blue'><b>Edward</b></font>) won't be able to touch her (<font color='blue'><b>Alice</b></font>).''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``He (<font color='blue'><b>Edward</b></font>)'ll wait.''
 (<font color='red'><b>Emmett</b></font>)</div>Emmett smiled. <div class="bookquote">``I can wait, too.''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``You didn't see  you don't understand. Once he (<font color='blue'><b>Edward</b></font>) commits to a hunt, he (<font color='blue'><b>Edward</b></font>)'s unshakable. We'd have to kill
him (<font color='blue'><b>Edward</b></font>).''
 (<font color='red'><b>Emmett</b></font>)</div>Emmett didn't seem upset by the idea. <div class="bookquote">``That's an option.''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``And the female. She (<font color='blue'><b>female</b></font>)'s with him (<font color='blue'><b>Edward</b></font>). If it turns into a fight, the leader will go with them, too.''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``There are enough of us.''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``There's another option,''  (<font color='red'><b>Alice</b></font>)</div>Alice said quietly.
Edward turned on her (<font color='blue'><b>Alice</b></font>) in fury, his (<font color='blue'><b>Edward</b></font>) voice a blistering snarl. <div class="bookquote">``There  is  no  other  option!''
 (<font color='red'><b>Emmett</b></font>)</div>Emmett and I both stared at him (<font color='blue'><b>Emmett</b></font>) in shock, but Alice seemed unsurprised. The silence lasted for a long
minute as Edward and Alice stared each other down.
I broke it. <div class="bookquote">``Does anyone want to hear my plan?''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``No,''  (<font color='red'><b>Edward/Edward Cullen/Cullen</b></font>)</div>Edward growled. Alice glared at him (<font color='blue'><b>Edward</b></font>), finally provoked.
<div class="bookquote">``Listen,''  (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div>I pleaded. <div class="bookquote">``You take me back.''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``No,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Edward</b></font>) interrupted.
I glared at him (<font color='blue'><b>Edward</b></font>) and continued. <div class="bookquote">``You take me back. I tell my dad I want to go home to Phoenix. I pack
my bags. We wait till this tracker is watching, and then we run. He (<font color='blue'><b>dad</b></font>)'ll follow us and leave Charlie alone.
Charlie won't call the FBI on your family. Then you can take me any damned place you want.''
 (<font color='red'><b>me</b></font>)</div>They stared at me, stunned.
<div class="bookquote">``It's not a bad idea, really.''  (<font color='red'><b>Emmett</b></font>)</div>Emmett's surprise was definitely an insult.
<div class="bookquote">``It might work  and we simply can't leave her (<font color='blue'><b>me</b></font>) father unprotected. You know that,''  (<font color='red'><b>Alice</b></font>)</div>Alice said.
Everyone looked at Edward.
<div class="bookquote">``It's too dangerous  I don't want him (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) within a hundred miles of her (<font color='blue'><b>me</b></font>).''
 (<font color='red'><b>Emmett</b></font>)</div>Emmett was supremely confident. <div class="bookquote">``Edward, he (<font color='blue'><b>Edward</b></font>)'s not getting through us.''
 (<font color='red'><b>Alice</b></font>)</div>Alice thought for a minute. <div class="bookquote">``I don't see him (<font color='blue'><b>Edward</b></font>) attacking. He (<font color='blue'><b>Edward</b></font>)'ll try to wait for us to leave her (<font color='blue'><b>me</b></font>) alone.''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``It won't take long for him (<font color='blue'><b>Edward</b></font>) to realize that's not going to happen.''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``I demand that you take me home.''  (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div>I tried to sound firm.

<p/>Edward pressed his (<font color='blue'><b>Edward</b></font>) fingers to his (<font color='blue'><b>Edward</b></font>) temples and squeezed his (<font color='blue'><b>Edward</b></font>) eyes shut.
<div class="bookquote">``Please,''  (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div>I said in a much smaller voice.
He (<font color='blue'><b>Edward</b></font>) didn't look up. When he (<font color='blue'><b>Edward</b></font>) spoke, his (<font color='blue'><b>Edward</b></font>) voice sounded worn.
<div class="bookquote">``You're leaving tonight, whether the tracker sees or not. You tell Charlie that you can't stand another
minute in Forks. Tell him (<font color='blue'><b>Charlie</b></font>) whatever story works. Pack the first things your hands touch, and then get in
your truck. I don't care what he (<font color='blue'><b>Charlie</b></font>) says to you. You have fifteen minutes. Do you hear me? Fifteen minutes
from the time you cross the doorstep.''
 (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>The Jeep rumbled to life, and he (<font color='blue'><b>Edward</b></font>) spun us around, the tires squealing. The needle on the speedometer
started to race up the dial.
<div class="bookquote">``Emmett?''  (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div>I asked, looking pointedly at my hands.
<div class="bookquote">``Oh, sorry.''  (<font color='red'><b>He</b></font>)</div>He (<font color='blue'><b>Edward</b></font>) let me loose.
A few minutes passed in silence, other than the roar of the engine. Then Edward spoke again.
<div class="bookquote">``This is how it's going to happen. When we get to the house, if the tracker is not there, I will walk her (<font color='blue'><b>me</b></font>) to
the door. Then she (<font color='blue'><b>me</b></font>) has fifteen minutes.''  (<font color='red'><b>He</b></font>)</div>He (<font color='blue'><b>Edward</b></font>) glared at me in the rearview mirror. <div class="bookquote">``Emmett, you take the
outside of the house. Alice, you get the truck. I'll be inside as long as she (<font color='blue'><b>Alice</b></font>) is. After she (<font color='blue'><b>Alice</b></font>)'s out, you two can
take the Jeep home and tell Carlisle.''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``No way,''  (<font color='red'><b>Emmett</b></font>)</div>Emmett broke in. <div class="bookquote">``I'm with you.''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``Think it through, Emmett. I don't know how long I'll be gone.''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``Until we know how far this is going to go, I'm with you.''
 (<font color='red'><b>Edward/Edward Cullen/Cullen</b></font>)</div>Edward sighed. <div class="bookquote">``If the tracker is there,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Edward</b></font>) continued grimly, <div class="bookquote">``we keep driving.''
 (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``We're going to make it there before him (<font color='blue'><b>Emmett</b></font>),''  (<font color='red'><b>Alice</b></font>)</div>Alice said confidently.
Edward seemed to accept that. Whatever his (<font color='blue'><b>Edward</b></font>) problem with Alice was, he (<font color='blue'><b>Edward</b></font>) didn't doubt her (<font color='blue'><b>Alice</b></font>) now.
<div class="bookquote">``What are we going to do with the Jeep?''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Alice</b></font>) asked.
His (<font color='blue'><b>Edward</b></font>) voice had a hard edge. <div class="bookquote">``You're driving it home.''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``No, I'm not,''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Alice</b></font>) said calmly.
The unintelligible stream of profanities started again.
<div class="bookquote">``We can't all fit in my truck,''  (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div>I whispered.
Edward didn't appear to hear me.
<div class="bookquote">``I think you should let me go alone,''  (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div>I said even more quietly.
He (<font color='blue'><b>Edward</b></font>) heard that.
<div class="bookquote">``Bella, please just do this my way, just this once,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Edward</b></font>) said between clenched teeth.
<div class="bookquote">``Listen, Charlie's not an imbecile,''  (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div>I protested. ``If you're not in town tomorrow, he (<font color='blue'><b>imbecile</b></font>)'s going to get

<p/>suspicious.''
``That's irrelevant. We'll make sure he (<font color='blue'><b>imbecile</b></font>)'s safe, and that's all that matters.''
``Then what about this tracker? He (<font color='blue'><b>imbecile</b></font>) saw the way you acted tonight. He (<font color='blue'><b>imbecile</b></font>)'s going to think you're with me,
wherever you are.''
Emmett looked at me, insultingly surprised again. ``Edward, listen to her (<font color='blue'><b>Bella</b></font>),'' he (<font color='blue'><b>Emmett</b></font>) urged. ``I think she (<font color='blue'><b>Bella</b></font>)'s right.''
``Yes, she (<font color='blue'><b>Bella</b></font>) is,'' Alice agreed.
``I can't do that.'' Edward's voice was icy.
``Emmett should stay, too,'' I continued. ``He (<font color='blue'><b>Emmett</b></font>) definitely got an eyeful of Emmett.''
``What?'' Emmett turned on me.
``You'll get a better crack at him (<font color='blue'><b>Emmett</b></font>) if you stay,'' Alice agreed.
Edward stared at her (<font color='blue'><b>Alice</b></font>) incredulously. ``You think I should let her (<font color='blue'><b>Bella</b></font>) go alone?''
``Of course not,'' Alice said. ``Jasper and I will take her (<font color='blue'><b>Bella</b></font>).''
``I can't do that,'' Edward repeated, but this time there was a trace of defeat in his (<font color='blue'><b>Edward</b></font>) voice. The logic was
working on him (<font color='blue'><b>Edward</b></font>).
I tried to be persuasive. ``Hang out here for a week <div class="bookquote">'' I saw his (<font color='blue'><b>Edward</b></font>) expression in the mirror and amended
''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>a few days. Let Charlie see you haven't kidnapped me, and lead this James on a wild-goose chase.
Make sure he (<font color='blue'><b>James</b></font>)'s completely off my trail. Then come and meet me. Take a roundabout route, of course,
and then Jasper and Alice can go home.''
I could see him (<font color='blue'><b>Jasper</b></font>) beginning to consider it.
``Meet you where?''
``Phoenix.'' Of course.
``No. He (<font color='blue'><b>Jasper</b></font>)'ll hear that's where you're going,'' he (<font color='blue'><b>Jasper</b></font>) said impatiently.
``And you'll make it look like that's a ruse, obviously. He (<font color='blue'><b>Jasper</b></font>)'ll know that we'll know that he (<font color='blue'><b>Jasper</b></font>)'s listening. He (<font color='blue'><b>Jasper</b></font>)'ll
never believe I'm actually going where I say I am going.''
``She (<font color='blue'><b>Bella</b></font>)'s diabolical,'' Emmett chuckled.
``And if that doesn't work?''
``There are several million people in Phoenix,'' I informed him (<font color='blue'><b>Emmett</b></font>).
``It's not that hard to find a phone book.''
``I won't go home.''
``Oh?'' he (<font color='blue'><b>Emmett</b></font>) inquired, a dangerous note in his (<font color='blue'><b>Emmett</b></font>) voice.
<div class="bookquote">``I'm quite old enough to get my own place.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Edward, we'll be with her (<font color='blue'><b>Bella</b></font>),''  (<font color='red'><b>Alice</b></font>)</div>Alice reminded him (<font color='blue'><b>Emmett</b></font>).
<div class="bookquote">``What are you going to do in Phoenix?''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Emmett</b></font>) asked her (<font color='blue'><b>Alice</b></font>) scathingly.
<div class="bookquote">``Stay indoors.''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``I kind of like it.''  (<font color='red'><b>Emmett</b></font>)</div>Emmett was thinking about cornering James, no doubt.
<div class="bookquote">``Shut up, Emmett.''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``Look, if we try to take him (<font color='blue'><b>Emmett</b></font>) down while she (<font color='blue'><b>Bella</b></font>)'s still around, there's a much better chance that someone
will get hurt  she (<font color='blue'><b>Bella</b></font>)'ll get hurt, or you will, trying to protect her (<font color='blue'><b>Bella</b></font>). Now, if we get him (<font color='blue'><b>Emmett</b></font>) alone''  (<font color='red'><b>He</b></font>)</div>He (<font color='blue'><b>Emmett</b></font>) trailed
off with a slow smile. I was right.
The Jeep was crawling slowly along now as we drove into town. Despite my brave talk, I could feel the
hairs on my arms standing up. I thought about Charlie, alone in the house, and tried to be courageous.
<div class="bookquote">``Bella.''  (<font color='red'><b>Edward/Edward Cullen/Cullen</b></font>)</div>Edward's voice was very soft. Alice and Emmett looked out their windows. <div class="bookquote">``If you let anything
happen to yourself anything at all  I'm holding you personally responsible. Do you understand that?''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``Yes,''  (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div>I gulped.
He (<font color='blue'><b>Emmett</b></font>) turned to Alice.
<div class="bookquote">``Can Jasper handle this?''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``Give him (<font color='blue'><b>Jasper</b></font>) some credit, Edward. He (<font color='blue'><b>Edward</b></font>)'s been doing very, very well, all things considered.''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``Can you handle this?''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Emmett</b></font>) asked.
And graceful little Alice pulled back her (<font color='blue'><b>Alice</b></font>) lips in a horrific grimace and let loose with a guttural snarl that
had me cowering against the seat in terror.
Edward smiled at her (<font color='blue'><b>Alice</b></font>). <div class="bookquote">``But keep your opinions to yourself,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Edward</b></font>) muttered suddenly.

<p/>19. GOODBYES

<p/>Charlie was waiting up for me. All the house lights were on. My mind was blank as I tried to think of a
way to make him (<font color='blue'><b>Charlie</b></font>) let me go. This wasn't going to be pleasant.
Edward pulled up slowly, staying well back from my truck. All three of them were acutely alert, ramrod
straight in their seats, listening to every sound of the wood, looking through every shadow, catching every
scent, searching for something out of place. The engine cut off, and I sat, motionless, as they continued to
listen.
<div class="bookquote">``He (<font color='blue'><b>Edward</b></font>)'s not here,''  (<font color='red'><b>Edward/Edward Cullen/Cullen</b></font>)</div>Edward said tensely. <div class="bookquote">``Let's go.''  (<font color='red'><b>Emmett</b></font>)</div>Emmett reached over to help me get out of the harness.
<div class="bookquote">``Don't worry, Bella,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Emmett</b></font>) said in a low but cheerful voice, <div class="bookquote">``we'll take care of things here quickly.''
 (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>I felt moisture filling up my eyes as I looked at Emmett. I barely knew him (<font color='blue'><b>Emmett</b></font>), and yet, somehow, not
knowing when I would see him (<font color='blue'><b>Emmett</b></font>) again after tonight was anguishing. I knew this was just a faint taste of the
goodbyes I would have to survive in the next hour, and the thought made the tears begin to spill.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Alice, Emmett.''  (<font color='red'><b>Edward/Edward Cullen/Cullen</b></font>)</div>Edward's voice was a command. They slithered soundlessly into the darkness, instantly
disappearing. Edward opened my door and took my hand, then drew me into the protecting enclosure of
his (<font color='blue'><b>Edward</b></font>) arm. He (<font color='blue'><b>Edward</b></font>) walked me swiftly toward the house, eyes always roving through the night.
<div class="bookquote">``Fifteen minutes,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Edward</b></font>) warned under his (<font color='blue'><b>Edward</b></font>) breath.
<div class="bookquote">``I can do this.''  (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div>I sniffled. My tears had given me an inspiration.
I stopped on the porch and took hold of his (<font color='blue'><b>Edward</b></font>) face in my hands. I looked fiercely into his (<font color='blue'><b>Edward</b></font>) eyes.
<div class="bookquote">``I love you,''  (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div>I said in a low, intense voice. <div class="bookquote">``I will always love you, no matter what happens now.''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``Nothing is going to happen to you, Bella,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Edward</b></font>) said just as fiercely.
<div class="bookquote">``Just follow the plan, okay? Keep Charlie safe for me. He (<font color='blue'><b>Charlie</b></font>)'s not going to like me very much after this, and
I want to have the chance to apologize later.''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``Get inside, Bella. We have to hurry.''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>His (<font color='blue'><b>Edward</b></font>) voice was urgent.
<div class="bookquote">``One more thing,''  (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div>I whispered passionately. <div class="bookquote">``Don't listen to another word I say tonight!''  (<font color='red'><b>He</b></font>)</div>He (<font color='blue'><b>Edward</b></font>) was leaning
in, and so all I had to do was stretch up on my toes to kiss his (<font color='blue'><b>Edward</b></font>) surprised, frozen lips with as much force
as I was capable of. Then I turned and kicked the door open.
<div class="bookquote">``Go away, Edward!''  (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div>I yelled at him (<font color='blue'><b>Edward</b></font>), running inside and slamming the door shut in his (<font color='blue'><b>Edward</b></font>) still-shocked face.
<div class="bookquote">``Bella?''  (<font color='red'><b>Charlie</b></font>)</div>Charlie had been hovering in the living room, and he (<font color='blue'><b>Charlie</b></font>) was already on his (<font color='blue'><b>Charlie</b></font>) feet.
<div class="bookquote">``Leave me alone!''  (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div>I screamed at him (<font color='blue'><b>Charlie</b></font>) through my tears, which were flowing relentlessly now. I ran up the
stairs to my room, throwing the door shut and locking it. I ran to my bed, flinging myself on the floor to
retrieve my duffel bag. I reached swiftly between the mattress and box spring to grab the knotted old
sock that contained my secret cash hoard.
Charlie was pounding on my door.
<div class="bookquote">``Bella, are you okay? What's going on?''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>His (<font color='blue'><b>Charlie</b></font>) voice was frightened.
<div class="bookquote">``I'm going borne,''  (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div>I shouted, my voice breaking in the perfect spot.
<div class="bookquote">``Did he (<font color='blue'><b>Edward</b></font>) hurt you?''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>His (<font color='blue'><b>Charlie</b></font>) tone edged toward anger.
<div class="bookquote">``No!''  (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div>I shrieked a few octaves higher. I turned to my dresser, and Edward was already there, silently
yanking out armfuls of random clothes, which he (<font color='blue'><b>Edward</b></font>) proceeded to throw to me.
<div class="bookquote">``Did he (<font color='blue'><b>Edward</b></font>) break up with you?''  (<font color='red'><b>Charlie</b></font>)</div>Charlie was perplexed.
<div class="bookquote">``No!''  (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div>I yelled, slightly more breathless as I shoved everything into the bag. Edward threw another
drawer's contents at me. The bag was pretty much full now.
<div class="bookquote">``What happened, Bella?''  (<font color='red'><b>Charlie</b></font>)</div>Charlie shouted through the door, pounding again.
<div class="bookquote">``I broke up with him (<font color='blue'><b>Edward</b></font>)!''  (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div>I shouted back, jerking on the zipper of my bag. Edward's capable hands pushed
mine away and zipped it smoothly. He (<font color='blue'><b>Edward</b></font>) put the strap carefully over my arm.
<div class="bookquote">``I'll be in the truck  go!''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Edward</b></font>) whispered, and pushed me toward the door. He (<font color='blue'><b>Edward</b></font>) vanished out the window.
I unlocked the door and pushed past Charlie roughly, struggling with my heavy bag as I ran down the

<p/>stairs.
<div class="bookquote">``What happened?''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Charlie</b></font>) yelled. He (<font color='blue'><b>Charlie</b></font>) was right behind me. <div class="bookquote">``I thought you liked him (<font color='blue'><b>Edward</b></font>).''
 (<font color='red'><b>He</b></font>)</div>He (<font color='blue'><b>Charlie</b></font>) caught my elbow in the kitchen. Though he (<font color='blue'><b>Charlie</b></font>) was still bewildered, his (<font color='blue'><b>Charlie</b></font>) grip was firm.
He (<font color='blue'><b>Charlie</b></font>) spun me around to look at him (<font color='blue'><b>Charlie</b></font>), and I could see in his (<font color='blue'><b>Charlie</b></font>) face that he (<font color='blue'><b>Charlie</b></font>) had no intention of letting me leave.
I could think of only one way to escape, and it involved hurting him (<font color='blue'><b>Charlie</b></font>) so much that I hated myself for even
considering it. But I had no time, and I had to keep him (<font color='blue'><b>Charlie</b></font>) safe.
I glared up at my father, fresh tears in my eyes for what I was about to do.
<div class="bookquote">``I do like him (<font color='blue'><b>Edward</b></font>)  that's the problem. I can't do this anymore! I can't put down any more roots here! I
don't want to end up trapped in this stupid, boring town like Mom! I'm not going to make the same dumb
mistake she (<font color='blue'><b>Mom</b></font>) did. I hate it  I can't stay here another minute!''
 (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div>His (<font color='blue'><b>Charlie</b></font>) hand dropped from my arm like I'd electrocuted him (<font color='blue'><b>Charlie</b></font>). I turned away from his (<font color='blue'><b>Charlie</b></font>) shocked, wounded face
and headed for the door.
<div class="bookquote">``Bells, you can't leave now. It's nighttime,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Charlie</b></font>) whispered behind me.
I didn't turn around. <div class="bookquote">``I'll sleep in the truck if I get tired.''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``Just wait another week,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Charlie</b></font>) pled, still shell-shocked. <div class="bookquote">``Rene will be back by then.''
 (<font color='red'><b>me</b></font>)</div>This completely derailed me. <div class="bookquote">``What?''
 (<font color='red'><b>Charlie</b></font>)</div>Charlie continued eagerly, almost babbling with relief as I hesitated. <div class="bookquote">``She (<font color='blue'><b>Mom</b></font>) called while you were out.
Things aren't going so well in Florida, and if Phil doesn't get signed by the end of the week, they're going
back to Arizona. The assistant coach of the Sidewinders said they might have a spot for another
shortstop.''
 (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div>I shook my head, trying to reassemble my now-confused thoughts. Every passing second put Charlie in
more danger.
<div class="bookquote">``I have a key,''  (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div>I muttered, turning the knob. He (<font color='blue'><b>Charlie</b></font>) was too close, one hand extended toward me, his (<font color='blue'><b>Charlie</b></font>) face
dazed. I couldn't lose any more time arguing with him (<font color='blue'><b>Charlie</b></font>). I was going to have to hurt him (<font color='blue'><b>Charlie</b></font>) further.
<div class="bookquote">``Just let me go, Charlie.''  (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div>I repeated my mother's last words as she (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>)'d walked out this same door so many
years ago. I said them as angrily as I could manage, and I threw the door open. <div class="bookquote">``It didn't work out,
okay? I really, really hate Forks!''
 (<font color='red'><b>Charlie</b></font>)</div>My cruel words did their job  Charlie stayed frozen on the doorstep, stunned, while I ran into the
night. I was hideously frightened of the empty yard. I ran wildly for the truck, visualizing a dark shadow
behind me. I threw my bag in the bed and wrenched the door open. The key was waiting in the ignition.
<div class="bookquote">``I'll call you tomorrow!''  (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div>I yelled, wishing more than anything that I could explain everything to him (<font color='blue'><b>Charlie</b></font>) right
then, knowing I would never be able to. I gunned the engine and peeled out.
Edward reached for my hand.
<div class="bookquote">``Pull over,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Edward</b></font>) said as the house, and Charlie, disappeared behind us.
<div class="bookquote">``I can drive,''  (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div>I said through the tears pouring down my cheeks.

<p/>His (<font color='blue'><b>Charlie</b></font>) long hands unexpectedly gripped my waist, and his (<font color='blue'><b>Charlie</b></font>) foot pushed mine off the gas pedal. He (<font color='blue'><b>Charlie</b></font>) pulled me
across his (<font color='blue'><b>Charlie</b></font>) lap, wrenching my hands free of the wheel, and suddenly he (<font color='blue'><b>Charlie</b></font>) was in the driver's seat. The truck
didn't swerve an inch.
<div class="bookquote">``You wouldn't be able to find the house,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Charlie</b></font>) explained.
Lights flared suddenly behind us. I stared out the back window, eyes wide with horror.
<div class="bookquote">``It's just Alice,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Charlie</b></font>) reassured me. He (<font color='blue'><b>Charlie</b></font>) took my hand again.
My mind was filled with the image of Charlie in the doorway. <div class="bookquote">``The tracker?''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``He (<font color='blue'><b>Charlie</b></font>) heard the end of your performance,''  (<font color='red'><b>Edward/Edward Cullen/Cullen</b></font>)</div>Edward said grimly.
<div class="bookquote">``Charlie?''  (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div>I asked in dread.
<div class="bookquote">``The tracker followed us. He (<font color='blue'><b>Charlie</b></font>)'s running behind us now.''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>My body went cold.
<div class="bookquote">``Can we outrun him (<font color='blue'><b>Charlie</b></font>)?''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``No.''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>But he (<font color='blue'><b>Edward</b></font>) sped up as he (<font color='blue'><b>Edward</b></font>) spoke. The truck's engine whined in protest.
My plan suddenly didn't feel so brilliant anymore.
I was staring back at Alice's headlights when the truck shuddered and a dark shadow sprung up outside
the window.
My bloodcurdling scream lasted a fraction of a second before Edward's hand clamped down on my
mouth.
<div class="bookquote">``It's Emmett!''
 (<font color='red'><b>He</b></font>)</div>He (<font color='blue'><b>Edward</b></font>) released my mouth, and wound his (<font color='blue'><b>Edward</b></font>) arm around my waist.
<div class="bookquote">``It's okay, Bella,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Edward</b></font>) promised. <div class="bookquote">``You're going to be safe.''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>We raced through the quiet town toward the north highway.
<div class="bookquote">``I didn't realize you were still so bored with small-town life,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Edward</b></font>) said conversationally, and I knew he (<font color='blue'><b>Edward</b></font>) was
trying to distract me. <div class="bookquote">``It seemed like you were adjusting fairly well  especially recently. Maybe I was
just flattering myself that I was making life more interesting for you.''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``I wasn't being nice,''  (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div>I confessed, ignoring his (<font color='blue'><b>Edward</b></font>) attempt at diversion, looking down at my knees. <div class="bookquote">``That was
the same thing my mom said when she (<font color='blue'><b>mom</b></font>) left him (<font color='blue'><b>Emmett</b></font>). You could say I was hitting below the belt.''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``Don't worry. He (<font color='blue'><b>Emmett</b></font>)'ll forgive you.''  (<font color='red'><b>He</b></font>)</div>He (<font color='blue'><b>Edward</b></font>) smiled a little, though it didn't touch his (<font color='blue'><b>Edward</b></font>) eyes.
I stared at him (<font color='blue'><b>Edward</b></font>) desperately, and he (<font color='blue'><b>Edward</b></font>) saw the naked panic in my eyes.
<div class="bookquote">``Bella, it's going to be all right.''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``But it won't be all right when I'm not with you,''  (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div>I whispered.
<div class="bookquote">``We'll be together again in a few days,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Edward</b></font>) said, tightening his (<font color='blue'><b>Edward</b></font>) arm around me. ``Don't forget that this was

<p/>your idea.''
``It was the best idea  of course it was mine.''
His (<font color='blue'><b>Edward</b></font>) answering smile was bleak and disappeared immediately.
``Why did this happen?'' I asked, my voice catching. ``Why me?''
He (<font color='blue'><b>Edward</b></font>) stared blackly at the road ahead. ``It's my fault  I was a fool to expose you like that.'' The rage in
his (<font color='blue'><b>Edward</b></font>) voice was directed internally.
``That's not what I meant,'' I insisted. ``I was there, big deal. It didn't bother the other two. Why did this
James decide to kill met There're people all over the place, why me?''
He (<font color='blue'><b>Edward</b></font>) hesitated, thinking before he (<font color='blue'><b>Edward</b></font>) answered.
``I got a good look at his (<font color='blue'><b>James</b></font>) mind tonight,'' he (<font color='blue'><b>Edward</b></font>) began in a low voice. ``I'm not sure if there's anything I could
have done to avoid this, once he (<font color='blue'><b>James</b></font>) saw you. It is partially your fault.'' His (<font color='blue'><b>Edward</b></font>) voice was wry. ``If you didn't
smell so appallingly luscious, he (<font color='blue'><b>James</b></font>) might not have bothered. But when I defended you well, that made it a
lot worse. He (<font color='blue'><b>James</b></font>)'s not used to being thwarted, no matter how insignificant the object. He (<font color='blue'><b>James</b></font>) thinks of himself as
a hunter and nothing else. His (<font color='blue'><b>James</b></font>) existence is consumed with tracking, and a challenge is all he (<font color='blue'><b>James</b></font>) asks of life.
Suddenly we've presented him (<font color='blue'><b>James</b></font>) with a beautiful challenge  a large clan of strong fighters all bent on
protecting the one vulnerable element. You wouldn't believe how euphoric he (<font color='blue'><b>James</b></font>) is now. It's his (<font color='blue'><b>James</b></font>) favorite
game, and we've just made it his (<font color='blue'><b>James</b></font>) most exciting game ever.'' His (<font color='blue'><b>Edward</b></font>) tone was full of disgust.
He (<font color='blue'><b>Edward</b></font>) paused a moment.
``But if I had stood by, he (<font color='blue'><b>James</b></font>) would have killed you right then,'' he (<font color='blue'><b>Edward</b></font>) said with hopeless frustration.
``I thought I didn't smell the same to the others as I do to you,'' I said hesitantly.
``You don't. But that doesn't mean that you aren't still a temptation to every one of them. If you had
appealed to the tracker  or any of them  the same way you appeal to me, it would have meant a
fight right there.''
I shuddered.
``I don't think I have any choice but to kill him (<font color='blue'><b>James</b></font>) now,'' he (<font color='blue'><b>Edward</b></font>) muttered. ``Carlisle won't like it.''
I could hear the tires cross the bridge, though I couldn't see the river in the dark. I knew we were getting
close. I had to ask him (<font color='blue'><b>Edward</b></font>) now.
``How can you kill a vampire?''
He (<font color='blue'><b>Edward</b></font>) glanced at me with unreadable eyes and his (<font color='blue'><b>Edward</b></font>) voice was suddenly harsh. ``The only way to be sure is to
tear him (<font color='blue'><b>vampire</b></font>) to shreds, and then burn the pieces.''
``And the other two will fight with him (<font color='blue'><b>vampire</b></font>)?''
``The woman will. I'm not sure about Laurent. They don't have a very strong bond  he (<font color='blue'><b>Laurent</b></font>)'s only with them
for convenience. He (<font color='blue'><b>Laurent</b></font>) was embarrassed by James in the meadow''
``But James and the woman  they'll try to kill you?'' I asked, my voice raw.
``Bella, don't you dare waste time worrying about me. Your only concern is keeping yourself safe and 

please, please  trying not to be reckless.''
``Is he (<font color='blue'><b>James</b></font>) still following?''
``Yes. He (<font color='blue'><b>James</b></font>) won't attack the house, though. Not tonight.''
He (<font color='blue'><b>Edward</b></font>) turned off onto the invisible drive, with Alice following behind.
We drove right up to the house. The lights inside were bright, but they did little to alleviate the blackness
of the encroaching forest. Emmett had my door open before the truck was stopped; he (<font color='blue'><b>Emmett</b></font>) pulled me out of
the seat, tucked me like a football into his (<font color='blue'><b>Emmett</b></font>) vast chest, and ran me through the door.
We burst into the large white room, Edward and Alice at our sides. All of them were there; they were
already on their feet at the sound of our approach. Laurent stood in their midst. I could hear low growls
rumble deep in Emmett's throat as he (<font color='blue'><b>Emmett</b></font>) set me down next to Edward.
``He (<font color='blue'><b>James</b></font>)'s tracking us,'' Edward announced, glaring balefully at Laurent.
Laurent's face was unhappy. ``I was afraid of that.''
Alice danced to Jasper's side and whispered in his (<font color='blue'><b>Jasper</b></font>) ear; her (<font color='blue'><b>Alice</b></font>) lips quivered with the speed of her (<font color='blue'><b>Alice</b></font>) silent
speech. They flew up the stairs together. Rosalie watched them, and then moved quickly to Emmett's
side. Her (<font color='blue'><b>Rosalie</b></font>) beautiful eyes were intense and  when they flickered unwillingly to my face  furious.
``What will he (<font color='blue'><b>James</b></font>) do?'' Carlisle asked Laurent in chilling tones.
``I'm sorry,'' he (<font color='blue'><b>Carlisle</b></font>) answered. ``I was afraid, when your boy there defended her (<font color='blue'><b>Bella</b></font>), that it would set him (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>) off.''
``Can you stop him (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>)?''
Laurent shook his (<font color='blue'><b>Laurent</b></font>) head. ``Nothing stops James when he (<font color='blue'><b>James</b></font>) gets started.''
``We'll stop him (<font color='blue'><b>James</b></font>),'' Emmett promised. There was no doubt what he (<font color='blue'><b>Emmett</b></font>) meant.
``You can't bring him (<font color='blue'><b>James</b></font>) down. I've never seen anything like him (<font color='blue'><b>James</b></font>) in my three hundred years. He (<font color='blue'><b>James</b></font>)'s absolutely
lethal. That's why I joined his (<font color='blue'><b>James</b></font>) coven.''
His (<font color='blue'><b>Emmett</b></font>) coven, I thought, of course. The show of leadership in the clearing was merely that, a show.
Laurent was shaking his (<font color='blue'><b>Laurent</b></font>) head. He (<font color='blue'><b>Laurent</b></font>) glanced at me, perplexed, and back to Carlisle. ``Are you sure it's
worth it?''
Edward's enraged roar filled the room; Laurent cringed back.
Carlisle looked gravely at Laurent. ``I'm afraid you're going to have to make a choice.''
Laurent understood. He (<font color='blue'><b>Laurent</b></font>) deliberated for a moment. His (<font color='blue'><b>Laurent</b></font>) eyes took in every face, and finally swept the
bright room.
``I'm intrigued by the life you've created here. But I won't get in the middle of this. I bear none of you any
enmity, but I won't go up against James. I think I will head north  to that clan in Denali.'' He (<font color='blue'><b>Laurent</b></font>) hesitated.
<div class="bookquote">``Don't underestimate James. He (<font color='blue'><b>James</b></font>)'s got a brilliant mind and unparalleled senses. He (<font color='blue'><b>James</b></font>)'s every bit as
comfortable in the human world as you seem to be, and he (<font color='blue'><b>James</b></font>) won't come at you head on I'm sorry for
what's been unleashed here. Truly sorry.''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>He (<font color='blue'><b>Laurent</b></font>) bowed his (<font color='blue'><b>Laurent</b></font>) head, but I saw him (<font color='blue'><b>Laurent</b></font>) flicker another puzzled look
at me.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Go in peace,''  (<font color='red'><b>Carlisle</b></font>)</div>was Carlisle's formal answer.
Laurent took another long look around himself, and then he (<font color='blue'><b>Laurent</b></font>) hurried out the door.
The silence lasted less than a second.
<div class="bookquote">``How close?''  (<font color='red'><b>Carlisle</b></font>)</div>Carlisle looked to Edward.
Esme was already moving; her (<font color='blue'><b>Laurent</b></font>) hand touched an inconspicuous keypad on the wall, and with a groan,
huge metal shutters began sealing up the glass wall. I gaped.
<div class="bookquote">``About three miles out past the river; he (<font color='blue'><b>James</b></font>)'s circling around to meet up with the female.''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``What's the plan?''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``We'll lead him (<font color='blue'><b>James</b></font>) off, and then Jasper and Alice will run her (<font color='blue'><b>Alice</b></font>) south.''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``And then?''
 (<font color='red'><b>Edward/Edward Cullen/Cullen</b></font>)</div>Edward's tone was deadly. <div class="bookquote">``As soon as Bella is clear, we hunt him (<font color='blue'><b>Jasper</b></font>).''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``I guess there's no other choice,''  (<font color='red'><b>Carlisle</b></font>)</div>Carlisle agreed, his (<font color='blue'><b>Carlisle</b></font>) face grim.
Edward turned to Rosalie.
<div class="bookquote">``Get her (<font color='blue'><b>Bella</b></font>) upstairs and trade clothes,''  (<font color='red'><b>Edward/Edward Cullen/Cullen</b></font>)</div>Edward commanded. She (<font color='blue'><b>Rosalie</b></font>) stared back at him (<font color='blue'><b>Edward</b></font>) with livid disbelief.
<div class="bookquote">``Why should I?''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Rosalie</b></font>) hissed. <div class="bookquote">``What is she (<font color='blue'><b>Bella</b></font>) to me? Except a menace  a danger you've chosen to inflict
on all of us.''
 (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div>I flinched back from the venom in her (<font color='blue'><b>Rosalie</b></font>) voice.
<div class="bookquote">``Rose''  (<font color='red'><b>Emmett</b></font>)</div>Emmett murmured, putting one hand on her (<font color='blue'><b>Rosalie</b></font>) shoulder. She (<font color='blue'><b>Rosalie</b></font>) shook it off.
But I was watching Edward carefully, knowing his (<font color='blue'><b>Edward</b></font>) temper, worried about his (<font color='blue'><b>Edward</b></font>) reaction.
He (<font color='blue'><b>Edward</b></font>) surprised me. He (<font color='blue'><b>Edward</b></font>) looked away from Rosalie as if she (<font color='blue'><b>Rosalie</b></font>) hadn't spoken, as if she (<font color='blue'><b>Rosalie</b></font>) didn't exist.
<div class="bookquote">``Esme?''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Edward</b></font>) asked calmly.
<div class="bookquote">``Of course,''  (<font color='red'><b>Esme</b></font>)</div>Esme murmured.
Esme was at my side in half a heartbeat, swinging me up easily into her (<font color='blue'><b>Rosalie</b></font>) arms, and dashing up the stairs
before I could gasp in shock.
<div class="bookquote">``What are we doing?''  (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div>I asked breathlessly as she (<font color='blue'><b>Rosalie</b></font>) set me down in a dark room somewhere off the
second-story hall.
<div class="bookquote">``Trying to confuse the smell. It won't work for long, but it might help get you out.''  (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div>I could hear her (<font color='blue'><b>Rosalie</b></font>)
clothes falling to the floor.
<div class="bookquote">``I don't think I'll fit''  (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div>I hesitated, but her (<font color='blue'><b>Rosalie</b></font>) hands were abruptly pulling my shirt over my head. I quickly
stripped my jeans off myself. She (<font color='blue'><b>Rosalie</b></font>) handed me something, it felt like a shirt. I struggled to get my arms
through the right holes. As soon as I was done she (<font color='blue'><b>Rosalie</b></font>) handed me her (<font color='blue'><b>Rosalie</b></font>) slacks. I yanked them on, but I
couldn't get my feet out; they were too long. She (<font color='blue'><b>Rosalie</b></font>) deftly rolled the hems a few times so I could stand.
Somehow she (<font color='blue'><b>Rosalie</b></font>) was already in my clothes. She (<font color='blue'><b>Rosalie</b></font>) pulled me back to the stairs, where Alice stood, a small

<p/>leather bag in one hand. They each grabbed one of my elbows and half-carried me as they flew down the
stairs.
It appeared that everything had been settled downstairs in our absence. Edward and Emmett were ready
to leave, Emmett carrying a heavy-looking backpack over his (<font color='blue'><b>Emmett</b></font>) shoulder. Carlisle was handing something
small to Esme. He (<font color='blue'><b>Carlisle</b></font>) turned and handed Alice the same thing  it was a tiny silver cell phone.
<div class="bookquote">``Esme and Rosalie will be taking your truck, Bella,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Carlisle</b></font>) told me as he (<font color='blue'><b>Carlisle</b></font>) passed. I nodded, glancing warily at
Rosalie. She (<font color='blue'><b>Rosalie</b></font>) was glowering at Carlisle with a resentful expression.
<div class="bookquote">``Alice, Jasper  take the Mercedes. You'll need the dark tint in the south.''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>They nodded as well.
<div class="bookquote">``We're taking the Jeep.''
 (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div>I was surprised to see that Carlisle intended to go with Edward. I realized suddenly, with a stab of fear,
that they made up the hunting party.
<div class="bookquote">``Alice,''  (<font color='red'><b>Carlisle</b></font>)</div>Carlisle asked, <div class="bookquote">``will they take the bait?''
 (<font color='red'><b>Carlisle</b></font>)</div>Everyone watched Alice as she (<font color='blue'><b>Alice</b></font>) closed her (<font color='blue'><b>Alice</b></font>) eyes and became incredibly still.
Finally her (<font color='blue'><b>Alice</b></font>) eyes opened. <div class="bookquote">``He (<font color='blue'><b>Jasper</b></font>)'ll track you. The woman will follow the truck. We should be able to leave
after that.''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>Her (<font color='blue'><b>Alice</b></font>) voice was certain.
<div class="bookquote">``Let's go.''  (<font color='red'><b>Carlisle</b></font>)</div>Carlisle began to walk toward the kitchen.
But Edward was at my side at once. He (<font color='blue'><b>Edward</b></font>) caught me up in his (<font color='blue'><b>Edward</b></font>) iron grip, crushing me to him (<font color='blue'><b>Edward</b></font>). He (<font color='blue'><b>Edward</b></font>) seemed
unaware of his (<font color='blue'><b>Edward</b></font>) watching family as he (<font color='blue'><b>Edward</b></font>) pulled my face to his (<font color='blue'><b>Edward</b></font>), lifting my feet off the floor. For the shortest
second, his (<font color='blue'><b>Edward</b></font>) lips were icy and hard against mine. Then it was over. He (<font color='blue'><b>Edward</b></font>) set me down, still holding my face,
his (<font color='blue'><b>Edward</b></font>) glorious eyes burning into mine.
His (<font color='blue'><b>Edward</b></font>) eyes went blank, curiously dead, as he (<font color='blue'><b>Edward</b></font>) turned away.
And they were gone.
We stood there, the others looking away from me as the tears streaked noiselessly down my face.
The silent moment dragged on, and then Esme's phone vibrated in her (<font color='blue'><b>We</b></font>) hand. It flashed to her (<font color='blue'><b>We</b></font>) ear.
<div class="bookquote">``Now,''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>We</b></font>) said. Rosalie stalked out the front door without another glance in my direction, but Esme
touched my cheek as she (<font color='blue'><b>Rosalie</b></font>) passed.
<div class="bookquote">``Be safe.''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>Her (<font color='blue'><b>Rosalie</b></font>) whisper lingered behind them as they slipped out the door. I heard my truck start
thunderously, and then fade away.
Jasper and Alice waited. Alice's phone seemed to be at her (<font color='blue'><b>Alice</b></font>) ear before it buzzed.
<div class="bookquote">``Edward says the woman is on Esme's trail. I'll get the car.''  (<font color='red'><b>She</b></font>)</div>She (<font color='blue'><b>Alice</b></font>) vanished into the shadows the way
Edward had gone.
Jasper and I looked at each other. He (<font color='blue'><b>Jasper</b></font>) stood across the length of the entryway from me being careful.
<div class="bookquote">``You're wrong, you know,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Jasper</b></font>) said quietly.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``What?''  (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div>I gasped.
<div class="bookquote">``I can feel what you're feeling now  and you are worth it.''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``I'm not,''  (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div>I mumbled. <div class="bookquote">``If anything happens to them, it will be for nothing.''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``You're wrong,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Jasper</b></font>) repeated, smiling kindly at me.
I heard nothing, but then Alice stepped through the front door and came toward me with her (<font color='blue'><b>Alice</b></font>) arms held
out.
<div class="bookquote">``May I?''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Alice</b></font>) asked.
<div class="bookquote">``You're the first one to ask permission.''  (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div>I smiled wryly.
She (<font color='blue'><b>Alice</b></font>) lifted me in her (<font color='blue'><b>Alice</b></font>) slender arms as easily as Emmett had, shielding me protectively, and then we flew out
the door, leaving the lights bright behind us.

<p/>20. IMPATIENCE

<p/>When I woke up I was confused. My thoughts were hazy, still twisted up in dreams and nightmares; it
took me longer than it should have to realize where I was.
This room was too bland to belong anywhere but in a hotel. The bedside lamps, bolted to the tables,
were a dead giveaway, as were the long drapes made from the same fabric as the bedspread, and the
generic watercolor prints on the walls.
I tried to remember how I got here, but nothing came at first.
I did remember the sleek black car, the glass in the windows darker than that on a limousine. The engine
was almost silent, though we'd raced across the black freeways at more than twice the legal speed.
And I remembered Alice sitting with me on the dark leather backseat. Somehow, during the long night,
my head had ended up against her (<font color='blue'><b>Alice</b></font>) granite neck. My closeness didn't seem to bother her (<font color='blue'><b>Alice</b></font>) at all, and her (<font color='blue'><b>Alice</b></font>)
cool, hard skin was oddly comforting to me. The front of her (<font color='blue'><b>Alice</b></font>) thin cotton shirt was cold, damp with the
tears that streamed from my eyes until, red and sore, they ran dry.
Sleep had evaded me; my aching eyes strained open even though the night finally ended and dawn broke
over a low peak somewhere in California. The gray light, streaking across the cloudless sky, stung my
eyes. But I couldn't close them; when I did, the images that flashed all too vividly, like still slides behind
my lids, were unbearable. Charlie's broken expression  Edward's brutal snarl, teeth bared  Rosalie's
resentful glare  the keen-eyed scrutiny of the tracker  the dead look in Edward's eyes after he (<font color='blue'><b>Edward</b></font>)
kissed me the last time I couldn't stand to see them. So I fought against my weariness and the sun rose
higher.
I was still awake when we came through a shallow mountain pass and the sun, behind us now, reflected
off the tiled rooftops of the Valley of the Sun. I didn't have enough emotion left to be surprised that we'd
made a three-day journey in one. I stared blankly at the wide, flat expanse laid out in front of me.
Phoenix  the palm trees, the scrubby creosote, the haphazard lines of the intersecting freeways, the
green swaths of golf courses and turquoise splotches of swimming pools, all submerged in a thin smog
and embraced by the short, rocky ridges that weren't really big enough to be called mountains.

<p/>The shadows of the palm trees slanted across the freeway  defined, sharper than I remembered, paler
than they should be. Nothing could hide in these shadows. The bright, open freeway seemed benign
enough. But I felt no relief, no sense of homecoming.
<div class="bookquote">``Which way to the airport, Bella?''  (<font color='red'><b>Jasper</b></font>)</div>Jasper had asked, and I flinched, though his (<font color='blue'><b>Jasper</b></font>) voice was quite soft and
un-alarming. It was the first sound, besides the purr of the car, to break the long night's silence.
<div class="bookquote">``Stay on the I-ten,''  (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div>I'd answered automatically. <div class="bookquote">``We'll pass right by it.''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>My brain had worked slowly through the fog of sleep deprivation.
<div class="bookquote">``Are we flying somewhere?''  (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div>I'd asked Alice.
<div class="bookquote">``No, but it's better to be close, just in case.''
 (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div>I remembered beginning the loop around Sky Harbor International but not ending it. I suppose that
must have been when I'd fallen asleep.
Though, now that I'd chased the memories down, I did have a vague impression of leaving the car  the
sun was just falling behind the horizon  my arm draped over Alice's shoulder and her (<font color='blue'><b>Alice</b></font>) arm firm around
my waist, dragging me along as I stumbled through the warm, dry shadows.
I had no memory of this room.
I looked at the digital clock on the nightstand. The red numbers claimed it was three o'clock, but they
gave no indication if it was night or day. No edge of light escaped the thick curtains, but the room was
bright with the light from the lamps.
I rose stiffly and staggered to the window, pulling back the drapes.
It was dark outside. Three in the morning, then. My room looked out on a deserted section of the
freeway and the new long-term parking garage for the airport. It was slightly comforting to be able to
pinpoint time and place.
I looked down at myself. I was still wearing Esme's clothes, and they didn't fit very well at all. I looked
around the room, glad when I discovered my duffel bag on top of the low dresser.
I was on my way to find new clothes when a light tap on the door made me jump.
<div class="bookquote">``Can I come in?''  (<font color='red'><b>Alice</b></font>)</div>Alice asked.
I took a deep breath. <div class="bookquote">``Sure.''
 (<font color='red'><b>She</b></font>)</div>She (<font color='blue'><b>Alice</b></font>) walked in, and looked me over cautiously. <div class="bookquote">``You look like you could sleep longer,''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Alice</b></font>) said.
I just shook my head.
She (<font color='blue'><b>Alice</b></font>) drifted silently to the curtains and closed them securely before turning back to me.
<div class="bookquote">``We'll need to stay inside,''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Alice</b></font>) told me.
<div class="bookquote">``Okay.''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>My voice was hoarse; it cracked.
<div class="bookquote">``Thirsty?''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Alice</b></font>) asked.
I shrugged. <div class="bookquote">``I'm okay. How about you?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Nothing unmanageable.''  (<font color='red'><b>She</b></font>)</div>She (<font color='blue'><b>Alice</b></font>) smiled. <div class="bookquote">``I ordered some food for you, it's in the front room. Edward
reminded me that you have to eat a lot more frequently than we do.''
 (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div>I was instantly more alert. <div class="bookquote">``He (<font color='blue'><b>Edward</b></font>) called?''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``No,''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Alice</b></font>) said, and watched as my face fell. <div class="bookquote">``It was before we left.''
 (<font color='red'><b>She</b></font>)</div>She (<font color='blue'><b>Alice</b></font>) took my hand carefully and led me through the door into the living room of the hotel suite. I could
hear a low buzz of voices coming from the TV. Jasper sat motionlessly at the desk in the corner, his (<font color='blue'><b>Jasper</b></font>) eyes
watching the news with no glimmer of interest.
I sat on the floor next to the coffee table, where a tray of food waited, and began picking at it without
noticing what I was eating.
Alice perched on the arm of the sofa and stared blankly at the TV like Jasper.
I ate slowly, watching her (<font color='blue'><b>Alice</b></font>), turning now and then to glance quickly at Jasper. It began to dawn on me that
they were too still. They never looked away from the screen, though commercials were playing now. I
pushed the tray away, my stomach abruptly uneasy. Alice looked down at me.
<div class="bookquote">``What's wrong, Alice?''  (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div>I asked.
<div class="bookquote">``Nothing's wrong.''  (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div>Her (<font color='blue'><b>Alice</b></font>) eyes were wide, honest and I didn't trust them.
<div class="bookquote">``What do we do now?''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``We wait for Carlisle to call.''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``And should he (<font color='blue'><b>Carlisle</b></font>) have called by now?''  (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div>I could see that I was near the mark. Alice's eyes flitted from mine
to the phone on top of her (<font color='blue'><b>Alice</b></font>) leather bag and back.
<div class="bookquote">``What does that mean?''  (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div>My voice quavered, and I fought to control it. <div class="bookquote">``That he (<font color='blue'><b>Carlisle</b></font>) hasn't called yet?''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``It just means that they don't have anything to tell us.''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>But her (<font color='blue'><b>Alice</b></font>) voice was too even, and the air was harder to breathe.
Jasper was suddenly beside Alice, closer to me than usual.
<div class="bookquote">``Bella,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Jasper</b></font>) said in a suspiciously soothing voice. <div class="bookquote">``You have nothing to worry about. You are completely
safe here.''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``I know that.''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``Then why are you frightened?''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Jasper</b></font>) asked, confused. He (<font color='blue'><b>Jasper</b></font>) might feel the tenor of my emotions, but he (<font color='blue'><b>Jasper</b></font>)
couldn't read the reasons behind them.
<div class="bookquote">``You heard what Laurent said.''  (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div>My voice was just a whisper, but I was sure they could hear me. <div class="bookquote">``He (<font color='blue'><b>Laurent</b></font>)
said James was lethal. What if something goes wrong, and they get separated? If something happens to
any of them, Carlisle, Emmett Edward''  (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div>I gulped. <div class="bookquote">``If that wild female hurts Esme''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>My voice had
grown higher, a note of hysteria beginning to rise in it. <div class="bookquote">``How could I live with myself when it's my fault?
None of you should be risking yourselves for me ''
 (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``Bella, Bella, stop,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Jasper</b></font>) interrupted me, his (<font color='blue'><b>Jasper</b></font>) words pouring out so quickly they were hard to understand.
``You're worrying about all the wrong things, Bella. Trust me on this  none of us are in jeopardy. You

<p/>are under too much strain as it is; don't add to it with wholly unnecessary worries. Listen to me!'' he (<font color='blue'><b>Jasper</b></font>)
ordered, for I had looked away. ``Our family is strong. Our only fear is losing you.''
``But why should you ''
Alice interrupted this time, touching my cheek with her (<font color='blue'><b>Alice</b></font>) cold fingers. ``It's been almost a century that
Edward's been alone. Now he (<font color='blue'><b>Edward</b></font>)'s found you. You can't see the changes that we see, we who have been
with him (<font color='blue'><b>Edward</b></font>) for so long. Do you think any of us want to look into his (<font color='blue'><b>Edward</b></font>) eyes for the next hundred years if he (<font color='blue'><b>Edward</b></font>)
loses you?''
My guilt slowly subsided as I looked into her (<font color='blue'><b>Alice</b></font>) dark eyes. But, even as the calm spread over me, I knew I
couldn't trust my feelings with Jasper there.
It was a very long day.
We stayed in the room. Alice called down to the front desk and asked them to ignore our maid service
for now. The windows stayed shut, the TV on, though no one watched it. At regular intervals, food was
delivered for me. The silver phone resting on Alice's bag seemed to grow bigger as the hours passed.
My babysitters handled the suspense better than I did. As I fidgeted and paced, they simply grew more
still, two statues whose eyes followed me imperceptibly as I moved. I occupied myself with memorizing
the room; the striped pattern of the couches, tan, peach, cream, dull gold, and tan again. Sometimes I
stared at the abstract prints, randomly finding pictures in the shapes, like I'd found pictures in the clouds
as a child. I traced a blue hand, a woman combing her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) hair, a cat stretching. But when the pale red circle
became a staring eye, I looked away.
As the afternoon wore on, I went back to bed, simply for something to do. I hoped that by myself in the
dark, I could give in to the terrible fears that hovered on the edge of my consciousness, unable to break
through under Jasper's careful supervision.
But Alice followed me casually, as if by some coincidence she (<font color='blue'><b>Alice</b></font>) had grown tired of the front room at the
same time. I was beginning to wonder exactly what sort of instructions Edward had given her (<font color='blue'><b>Alice</b></font>). I lay
across the bed, and she (<font color='blue'><b>Alice</b></font>) sat, legs folded, next to me. I ignored her (<font color='blue'><b>Alice</b></font>) at first, suddenly tired enough to sleep.
But after a few minutes, the panic that had held off in Jasper's presence began to make itself known. I
gave up on the idea of sleep quickly then, curling up into a small ball, wrapping my arms around my legs.
``Alice?'' I asked.
``Yes?''
I kept my voice very calm. ``What do you think they're doing?''
``Carlisle wanted to lead the tracker as far north as possible, wait for him (<font color='blue'><b>Carlisle</b></font>) to get close, and then turn and
ambush him (<font color='blue'><b>Carlisle</b></font>). Esme and Rosalie were supposed to head west as long as they could keep the female
behind them. If she (<font color='blue'><b>female</b></font>) turned around, they were to head back to Forks and keep an eye on your dad. So I
imagine things are going well if they can't call. It means the tracker is close enough that they don't want
him (<font color='blue'><b>dad</b></font>) to overhear.''
``And Esme?''
``I think she (<font color='blue'><b>female</b></font>) must be back in Forks. She (<font color='blue'><b>female</b></font>) won't call if there's any chance the female will overhear. I expect
they're all just being very careful.''
<div class="bookquote">``Do you think they're safe, really?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Bella, how many times do we have to tell you that there's no danger to us?''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``Would you tell me the truth, though?''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``Yes. I will always tell you the truth.''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>Her (<font color='blue'><b>Alice</b></font>) voice was earnest.
I deliberated for a moment, and decided she (<font color='blue'><b>Alice</b></font>) meant it.
<div class="bookquote">``Tell me then how do you become a vampire?''
 (<font color='red'><b>her</b></font>)</div>My question caught her (<font color='blue'><b>Alice</b></font>) off guard. She (<font color='blue'><b>Alice</b></font>) was quiet. I rolled over to look at her (<font color='blue'><b>Alice</b></font>), and her (<font color='blue'><b>Alice</b></font>) expression seemed
ambivalent.
<div class="bookquote">``Edward doesn't want me to tell you that,''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Alice</b></font>) said firmly, but I sensed she (<font color='blue'><b>Alice</b></font>) didn't agree.
<div class="bookquote">``That's not fair. I think I have a right to know.''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``I know.''
 (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div>I looked at her (<font color='blue'><b>Alice</b></font>), waiting.
She (<font color='blue'><b>Alice</b></font>) sighed. <div class="bookquote">``He (<font color='blue'><b>Edward</b></font>)'ll be extremely angry.''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``It's none of his (<font color='blue'><b>Edward</b></font>) business. This is between you and me. Alice, as a friend, I'm begging you.''  (<font color='red'><b>friends</b></font>)</div>And we were
friends now, somehow  as she (<font color='blue'><b>Alice</b></font>) must have known we would be all along.
She (<font color='blue'><b>Alice</b></font>) looked at me with her (<font color='blue'><b>Alice</b></font>) splendid, wise eyes choosing.
<div class="bookquote">``I'll tell you the mechanics of it,''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Alice</b></font>) said finally, <div class="bookquote">``but I don't remember it myself, and I've never done it or
seen it done, so keep in mind that I can only tell you the theory.''
 (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>I waited.
<div class="bookquote">``As predators, we have a glut of weapons in our physical arsenal  much, much more than really
necessary. The strength, the speed, the acute senses, not to mention those of us like Edward, Jasper, and
I, who have extra senses as well. And then, like a carnivorous flower, we are physically attractive to our
prey.''
 (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div>I was very still, remembering how pointedly Edward had demonstrated the same concept for me in the
meadow.
She (<font color='blue'><b>Alice</b></font>) smiled a wide, ominous smile. <div class="bookquote">``We have another fairly superfluous weapon. We're also venomous,''
 (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Alice</b></font>) said, her (<font color='blue'><b>Alice</b></font>) teeth glistening. <div class="bookquote">``The venom doesn't kill  it's merely incapacitating. It works slowly,
spreading through the bloodstream, so that, once bitten, our prey is in too much physical pain to escape
us. Mostly superfluous, as I said. If we're that close, the prey doesn't escape. Of course, there are
always exceptions. Carlisle, for example.''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``So if the venom is left to spread''  (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div>I murmured.
<div class="bookquote">``It takes a few days for the transformation to be complete, depending on how much venom is in the
bloodstream, how close the venom enters to the heart. As long as the heart keeps beating, the poison
spreads, healing, changing the body as it moves through it. Eventually the heart stops, and the conversion
is finished. But all that time, every minute of it, a victim would be wishing for death.''
 (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div>I shivered.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``It's not pleasant, you see.''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``Edward said that it was very hard to do I don't quite understand,''  (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div>I said.
<div class="bookquote">``We're also like sharks in a way. Once we taste the blood, or even smell it for that matter, it becomes
very hard to keep from feeding. Sometimes impossible. So you see, to actually bite someone, to taste the
blood, it would begin the frenzy. It's difficult on both sides  the blood-lust on the one hand, the awful
pain on the other.''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``Why do you think you don't remember?''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``I don't know. For everyone else, the pain of transformation is the sharpest memory they have of their
human life. I remember nothing of being human.''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>Her (<font color='blue'><b>Alice</b></font>) voice was wistful.
We lay silently, wrapped in our individual meditations.
The seconds ticked by, and I had almost forgotten her (<font color='blue'><b>Alice</b></font>) presence, I was so enveloped in my thoughts.
Then, without any warning, Alice leaped from the bed, landing lightly on her (<font color='blue'><b>Alice</b></font>) feet. My head jerked up as I
stared at her (<font color='blue'><b>Alice</b></font>), startled.
<div class="bookquote">``Something's changed.''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>Her (<font color='blue'><b>Alice</b></font>) voice was urgent, and she (<font color='blue'><b>Alice</b></font>) wasn't talking to me anymore.
She (<font color='blue'><b>Alice</b></font>) reached the door at the same time Jasper did. He (<font color='blue'><b>Jasper</b></font>) had obviously heard our conversation and her (<font color='blue'><b>Alice</b></font>)
sudden exclamation. He (<font color='blue'><b>Jasper</b></font>) put his (<font color='blue'><b>Jasper</b></font>) hands on her (<font color='blue'><b>Alice</b></font>) shoulders and guided her (<font color='blue'><b>Alice</b></font>) back to the bed, sitting her (<font color='blue'><b>Alice</b></font>) on the
edge.
<div class="bookquote">``What do you see?''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Jasper</b></font>) asked intently, staring into her (<font color='blue'><b>Alice</b></font>) eyes. Her (<font color='blue'><b>Alice</b></font>) eyes were focused on something very far
away. I sat close to her (<font color='blue'><b>Alice</b></font>), leaning in to catch her (<font color='blue'><b>Alice</b></font>) low, quick voice.
<div class="bookquote">``I see a room. It's long, and there are mirrors everywhere. The floor is wooden. He (<font color='blue'><b>everyone</b></font>)'s in the room, and
he (<font color='blue'><b>everyone</b></font>)'s waiting. There's gold a gold stripe across the mirrors.''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``Where is the room?''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``I don't know. Something is missing  another decision hasn't been made yet.''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``How much time?''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``It's soon. He (<font color='blue'><b>everyone</b></font>)'ll be in the mirror room today, or maybe tomorrow. It all depends. He (<font color='blue'><b>everyone</b></font>)'s waiting for
something. And he (<font color='blue'><b>everyone</b></font>)'s in the dark now.''
 (<font color='red'><b>Jasper</b></font>)</div>Jasper's voice was calm, methodical, as he (<font color='blue'><b>Jasper</b></font>) questioned her (<font color='blue'><b>Alice</b></font>) in a practiced way. <div class="bookquote">``What is he (<font color='blue'><b>everyone</b></font>) doing?''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``He (<font color='blue'><b>everyone</b></font>)'s watching TV no, he (<font color='blue'><b>everyone</b></font>)'s running a VCR, in the dark, in another place.''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``Can you see where he (<font color='blue'><b>everyone</b></font>) is?''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``No, it's too dark.''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``And the mirror room, what else is there?''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``Just the mirrors, and the gold. It's a band, around the room. And there's a black table with a big stereo,
and a TV. He (<font color='blue'><b>everyone</b></font>)'s touching the VCR there, but he (<font color='blue'><b>everyone</b></font>) doesn't watch the way he (<font color='blue'><b>everyone</b></font>) does in the dark room. This is
the room where he (<font color='blue'><b>everyone</b></font>) waits.''  (<font color='red'><b>Jasper</b></font>)</div>Her (<font color='blue'><b>Alice</b></font>) eyes drifted, then focused on Jasper's face.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``There's nothing else?''
 (<font color='red'><b>She</b></font>)</div>She (<font color='blue'><b>Alice</b></font>) shook her (<font color='blue'><b>Alice</b></font>) head. They looked at each other, motionless.
<div class="bookquote">``What does it mean?''  (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div>I asked.
Neither of them answered for a moment, then Jasper looked at me.
<div class="bookquote">``It means the tracker's plans have changed. He (<font color='blue'><b>everyone</b></font>)'s made a decision that will lead him (<font color='blue'><b>everyone</b></font>) to the mirror room,
and the dark room.''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``But we don't know where those rooms are?''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``No.''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``But we do know that he (<font color='blue'><b>everyone</b></font>) won't be in the mountains north of Washington, being hunted. He (<font color='blue'><b>everyone</b></font>)'ll elude them.''
 (<font color='red'><b>Alice</b></font>)</div>Alice's voice was bleak.
<div class="bookquote">``Should we call?''  (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div>I asked. They traded a serious look, undecided.
And the phone rang.
Alice was across the room before I could lift my head to look at it.
She (<font color='blue'><b>Alice</b></font>) pushed a button and held the phone to her (<font color='blue'><b>Alice</b></font>) ear, but she (<font color='blue'><b>Alice</b></font>) didn't speak first.
<div class="bookquote">``Carlisle,''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Alice</b></font>) breathed. She (<font color='blue'><b>Alice</b></font>) didn't seem surprised or relieved, the way I felt.
<div class="bookquote">``Yes,''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Alice</b></font>) said, glancing at me. She (<font color='blue'><b>Alice</b></font>) listened for a long moment.
<div class="bookquote">``I just saw him (<font color='blue'><b>everyone</b></font>).''  (<font color='red'><b>She</b></font>)</div>She (<font color='blue'><b>Alice</b></font>) described again the vision she (<font color='blue'><b>Alice</b></font>)'d seen. <div class="bookquote">``Whatever made him (<font color='blue'><b>everyone</b></font>) get on that plane it
was leading him (<font color='blue'><b>everyone</b></font>) to those rooms.''  (<font color='red'><b>She</b></font>)</div>She (<font color='blue'><b>Alice</b></font>) paused. <div class="bookquote">``Yes,''  (<font color='red'><b>Alice</b></font>)</div>Alice said into the phone, and then she (<font color='blue'><b>Alice</b></font>) spoke to
me. <div class="bookquote">``Bella?''
 (<font color='red'><b>She</b></font>)</div>She (<font color='blue'><b>Alice</b></font>) held the phone out toward me. I ran to it.
<div class="bookquote">``Hello?''  (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div>I breathed.
<div class="bookquote">``Bella,''  (<font color='red'><b>Edward/Edward Cullen/Cullen</b></font>)</div>Edward said.
<div class="bookquote">``Oh, Edward! I was so worried.''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``Bella,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Edward</b></font>) sighed in frustration, <div class="bookquote">``I told you not to worry about anything but yourself.''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>It was so
unbelievably good to hear his (<font color='blue'><b>Edward</b></font>) voice. I felt the hovering cloud of despair lighten and drift back as he (<font color='blue'><b>Edward</b></font>)
spoke.
<div class="bookquote">``Where are you?''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``We're outside of Vancouver. Bella, I'm sorry  we lost him (<font color='blue'><b>Edward</b></font>). He (<font color='blue'><b>Edward</b></font>) seems suspicious of us  he (<font color='blue'><b>Edward</b></font>)'s careful
to stay just far enough away that I can't hear what he (<font color='blue'><b>Edward</b></font>)'s thinking. But he (<font color='blue'><b>Edward</b></font>)'s gone now  it looks like he (<font color='blue'><b>Edward</b></font>) got
on a plane. We think he (<font color='blue'><b>Edward</b></font>)'s heading back to Forks to start over.''  (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div>I could hear Alice filling in Jasper behind
me, her (<font color='blue'><b>Alice</b></font>) quick words blurring together into a humming noise.
<div class="bookquote">``I know. Alice saw that he (<font color='blue'><b>Edward</b></font>) got away.''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>``You don't have to worry, though. He (<font color='blue'><b>Edward</b></font>) won't find anything to lead him (<font color='blue'><b>Edward</b></font>) to you. You just have to stay there

<p/>and wait till we find him (<font color='blue'><b>Edward</b></font>) again.''
``I'll be fine. Is Esme with Charlie?''
``Yes  the female has been in town. She (<font color='blue'><b>female</b></font>) went to the house, but while Charlie was at work. She (<font color='blue'><b>female</b></font>) hasn't
gone near him (<font color='blue'><b>Charlie</b></font>), so don't be afraid. He (<font color='blue'><b>Charlie</b></font>)'s safe with Esme and Rosalie watching.''
``What is she (<font color='blue'><b>Rosalie</b></font>) doing?''
``Probably trying to pick up the trail. She (<font color='blue'><b>Rosalie</b></font>)'s been all through the town during the night. Rosalie traced her (<font color='blue'><b>Rosalie</b></font>)
through the airport, all the roads around town, the school she (<font color='blue'><b>Rosalie</b></font>)'s digging, Bella, but there's nothing to
find.''
``And you're sure Charlie's safe?''
``Yes, Esme won't let him (<font color='blue'><b>Charlie</b></font>) out of her (<font color='blue'><b>Bella</b></font>) sight. And we'll be there soon. If the tracker gets anywhere near
Forks, we'll have him (<font color='blue'><b>Charlie</b></font>).''
``I miss you,'' I whispered.
``I know, Bella. Believe me, I know. It's like you've taken half my self away with you.''
``Come and get it, then,'' I challenged.
``Soon, as soon as I possibly can. I will make you safe first.'' His (<font color='blue'><b>Jasper</b></font>) voice was hard.
``I love you,'' I reminded him (<font color='blue'><b>Jasper</b></font>).
``Could you believe that, despite everything I've put you through, I love you, too?''
``Yes, I can, actually.''
``I'll come for you soon.''
``I'll be waiting.''
As soon as the phone went dead, the cloud of depression began to creep over me again.
I turned to give the phone back to Alice and found her (<font color='blue'><b>Alice</b></font>) and Jasper bent over the table, where Alice was
sketching on a piece of hotel stationery. I leaned on the back of the couch, looking over her (<font color='blue'><b>Alice</b></font>) shoulder.
She (<font color='blue'><b>Alice</b></font>) drew a room: long, rectangular, with a thinner, square section at the back. The wooden planks that
made up the floor stretched lengthwise across the room. Down the walls were lines denoting the breaks
in the mirrors. And then, wrapping around the walls, waist high, a long band. The band Alice said was
gold.
``It's a ballet studio,'' I said, suddenly recognizing the familiar shapes.
They looked at me, surprised.
``Do you know this room?'' Jasper's voice sounded calm, but there was an undercurrent of something I
couldn't identify. Alice bent her (<font color='blue'><b>Alice</b></font>) head to her (<font color='blue'><b>Alice</b></font>) work, her (<font color='blue'><b>Alice</b></font>) hand flying across the page now, the shape of an
emergency exit taking shape against the back wall, the stereo and TV on a low table by the front right
corner.
``It looks like a place I used to go for dance lessons  when I was eight or nine. It was shaped just the

<p/>same.'' I touched the page where the square section jutted out, narrowing the back part of the room.
``That's where the bathrooms were  the doors were through the other dance floor. But the stereo was
here''  I pointed to the left corner  ``it was older, and there wasn't a TV. There was a window in the
waiting room  you would see the room from this perspective if you looked through it.''
Alice and Jasper were staring at me.
``Are you sure it's the same room?'' Jasper asked, still calm.
``No, not at all  I suppose most dance studios would look the same  the mirrors, the bar.'' I traced
my finger along the ballet bar set against the mirrors. ``It's just the shape that looked familiar.'' I touched
the door, set in exactly the same place as the one I remembered.
``Would you have any reason to go there now?'' Alice asked, breaking my reverie.
``No, I haven't been there in almost ten years. I was a terrible dancer  they always put me in the back
for recitals,'' I admitted.
``So there's no way it could be connected with you?'' Alice asked intently.
``No, I don't even think the same person owns it. I'm sure it's just another dance studio, somewhere.''
``Where was the studio you went to?'' Jasper asked in a casual voice.
``It was just around the corner from my mom's house. I used to walk there after school'' I said, my
voice trailing off. I didn't miss the look they exchanged.
``Here in Phoenix, then?'' His (<font color='blue'><b>Jasper</b></font>) voice was still casual.
``Yes,'' I whispered. ``Fifty-eighth Street and Cactus.''
We all sat in silence, staring at the drawing.
``Alice, is that phone safe?''
``Yes,'' she (<font color='blue'><b>Alice</b></font>) reassured me. ``The number would just trace back to Washington.''
``Then I can use it to call my mom.''
``I thought she (<font color='blue'><b>mom</b></font>) was in Florida.''
``She (<font color='blue'><b>mom</b></font>) is  but she (<font color='blue'><b>mom</b></font>)'s coming home soon, and she (<font color='blue'><b>mom</b></font>) can't come back to that house while'' My voice
trembled. I was thinking about something Edward had said, about the red-haired female at Charlie's
house, at the school, where my records would be.
``How will you reach her (<font color='blue'><b>mom</b></font>)?''
``They don't have a permanent number except at the house  she (<font color='blue'><b>mom</b></font>)'s supposed to check her (<font color='blue'><b>mom</b></font>) messages
regularly.''
``Jasper?'' Alice asked.
He (<font color='blue'><b>Charlie</b></font>) thought about it. <div class="bookquote">``I don't think there's any way it could hurt  be sure you don't say where you are,
of course.''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>I reached eagerly for the phone and dialed the familiar number. It rang four times, and then I heard my

<p/>mom's breezy voice telling me to leave a message.
<div class="bookquote">``Mom,''  (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div>I said after the beep, <div class="bookquote">``it's me. Listen, I need you to do something. It's important. As soon as you
get this message, call me at this number.''  (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div>Alice was already at my side, writing the number for me on the
bottom of her (<font color='blue'><b>Alice</b></font>) picture. I read it carefully, twice. <div class="bookquote">``Please don't go anywhere until you talk to me. Don't
worry, I'm okay, but I have to talk to you right away, no matter how late you get this call, all right? I love
you, Mom. Bye.''  (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div>I closed my eyes and prayed with all my might that no unforeseen change of plans
would bring her (<font color='blue'><b>Alice</b></font>) home before she (<font color='blue'><b>Alice</b></font>) got my message.
I settled into the sofa, nibbling on a plate of leftover fruit, anticipating a long evening. I thought about
calling Charlie, but I wasn't sure if I should be home by now or not. I concentrated on the news, watching
out for stories about Florida, or about spring training  strikes or hurricanes or terrorist attacks 
anything that might send them home early.
Immortality must grant endless patience. Neither Jasper nor Alice seemed to feel the need to do anything
at all. For a while, Alice sketched the vague outline of the dark room from her (<font color='blue'><b>Alice</b></font>) vision, as much as she (<font color='blue'><b>Alice</b></font>)
could see in the light from the TV. But when she (<font color='blue'><b>Alice</b></font>) was done, she (<font color='blue'><b>Alice</b></font>) simply sat, looking at the blank walls with
her (<font color='blue'><b>Alice</b></font>) timeless eyes. Jasper, too, seemed to have no urge to pace, or peek through the curtains, or run
screaming out the door, the way I did.
I must have fallen asleep on the couch, waiting for the phone to ring again. The touch of Alice's cold
hands woke me briefly as she (<font color='blue'><b>Alice</b></font>) carried me to the bed, but I was unconscious again before my head hit the
pillow.

<p/>21. PHONE CALL

<p/>I could feel it was too early again when I woke, and I knew I was getting the schedule of my days and
nights slowly reversed. I lay in my bed and listened to the quiet voices of Alice and Jasper in the other
room. That they were loud enough for me to hear at all was strange. I rolled till my feet touched the floor
and then staggered to the living room.
The clock on the TV said it was just after two in the morning. Alice and Jasper were sitting together on
the sofa, Alice sketching again while Jasper looked over her (<font color='blue'><b>Alice</b></font>) shoulder. They didn't look up when I
entered, too engrossed in Alice's work.
I crept to Jasper's side to peek.
<div class="bookquote">``Did she (<font color='blue'><b>Mom</b></font>) see something more?''  (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div>I asked him (<font color='blue'><b>Jasper</b></font>) quietly.
<div class="bookquote">``Yes. Something's brought him (<font color='blue'><b>I</b></font>) back to the room with the VCR, but it's light now.''
 (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div>I watched as Alice drew a square room with dark beams across its low ceiling. The walls were paneled
in wood, a little too dark, out of date. The floor had a dark carpet with a pattern in it. There was a large
window against the south wall, and an opening through the west wall led to the living room. One side of
that entrance was stone  a large tan stone fireplace that was open to both rooms. The focus of the
room from this perspective, the TV and VCR, balanced on a too-small wooden stand, were in the
southwest corner of the room. An aged sectional sofa curved around in front of the TV, a round coffee
table in front of it.
<div class="bookquote">``The phone goes there,''  (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div>I whispered, pointing.

<p/>Two pairs of eternal eyes stared at me.
<div class="bookquote">``That's my mother's house.''
 (<font color='red'><b>Alice</b></font>)</div>Alice was already off the couch, phone in hand, dialing. I stared at the precise rendering of my mother's
family room. Uncharacteristically, Jasper slid closer to me. He (<font color='blue'><b>Jasper</b></font>) lightly touched his (<font color='blue'><b>Jasper</b></font>) hand to my shoulder,
and the physical contact seemed to make his (<font color='blue'><b>Jasper</b></font>) calming influence stronger. The panic stayed dull,
unfocused.
Alice's lips were trembling with the speed of her (<font color='blue'><b>Alice</b></font>) words, the low buzzing impossible to decipher. I
couldn't concentrate.
<div class="bookquote">``Bella,''  (<font color='red'><b>Alice</b></font>)</div>Alice said. I looked at her (<font color='blue'><b>Alice</b></font>) numbly.
<div class="bookquote">``Bella, Edward is coming to get you. He (<font color='blue'><b>Edward</b></font>) and Emmett and Carlisle are going to take you somewhere, to
hide you for a while.''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``Edward is coming?''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>The words were like a life vest, holding my head above the flood.
<div class="bookquote">``Yes, he (<font color='blue'><b>Edward</b></font>)'s catching the first flight out of Seattle. We'll meet him (<font color='blue'><b>Edward</b></font>) at the airport, and you'll leave with him (<font color='blue'><b>Edward</b></font>).''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``But, my mother he (<font color='blue'><b>Edward</b></font>) came here for my mother, Alice!''  (<font color='red'><b>Jasper</b></font>)</div>Despite Jasper, the hysteria bubbled up in my
voice.
<div class="bookquote">``Jasper and I will stay till she (<font color='blue'><b>Alice</b></font>)'s safe.''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``I can't win, Alice. You can't guard everyone I know forever. Don't you see what he (<font color='blue'><b>Jasper</b></font>)'s doing? He (<font color='blue'><b>Jasper</b></font>)'s not
tracking me at all. He (<font color='blue'><b>Jasper</b></font>)'ll find someone, he (<font color='blue'><b>Jasper</b></font>)'ll hurt someone I love Alice, I can't ''
 (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``We'll catch him (<font color='blue'><b>Jasper</b></font>), Bella,''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Alice</b></font>) assured me.
<div class="bookquote">``And what if you get hurt, Alice? Do you think that's okay with me? Do you think it's only my human
family he (<font color='blue'><b>Jasper</b></font>) can hurt me with?''
 (<font color='red'><b>Alice</b></font>)</div>Alice looked meaningfully at Jasper. A deep, heavy fog of lethargy washed over me, and my eyes closed
without my permission. My mind struggled against the fog, realizing what was happening. I forced my
eyes open and stood up, stepping away from Jasper's hand.
<div class="bookquote">``I don't want to go back to sleep,''  (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div>I snapped.
I walked to my room and shut the door, slammed it really, so I could be free to go to pieces privately.
This time Alice didn't follow me. For three and a half hours I stared at the wall, curled in a ball, rocking.
My mind went around in circles, trying to come up with some way out of this nightmare. There was no
escape, no reprieve. I could see only one possible end looming darkly in my future. The only question
was how many other people would be hurt before I reached it.
The only solace, the only hope I had left, was knowing that I would see Edward soon. Maybe, if I could
just see his (<font color='blue'><b>Edward</b></font>) face again, I would also be able to see the solution that eluded me now.
When the phone rang, I returned to the front room, a little ashamed of my behavior. I hoped I hadn't
offended either of them, that they would know how grateful I was for the sacrifices they were making on
my account.
Alice was talking as rapidly as ever, but what caught my attention was that, for the first time, Jasper was
not in the room. I looked at the clock  it was five-thirty in the morning.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``They're just boarding their plane,''  (<font color='red'><b>Alice</b></font>)</div>Alice told me. <div class="bookquote">``They'll land at nine-forty-five.''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>Just a few more hours
to keep breathing till he (<font color='blue'><b>Jasper</b></font>) was here.
<div class="bookquote">``Where's Jasper?''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``He (<font color='blue'><b>Jasper</b></font>) went to check out.''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``You aren't staying here?''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``No, we're relocating closer to your mother's house.''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>My stomach twisted uneasily at her (<font color='blue'><b>Alice</b></font>) words.
But the phone rang again, distracting me. She (<font color='blue'><b>Alice</b></font>) looked surprised, but I was already walking forward,
reaching hopefully for the phone.
<div class="bookquote">``Hello?''  (<font color='red'><b>Alice</b></font>)</div>Alice asked. <div class="bookquote">``No, she (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>)'s right here.''  (<font color='red'><b>She</b></font>)</div>She (<font color='blue'><b>Alice</b></font>) held the phone out to me. Your mother, she (<font color='blue'><b>Alice</b></font>) mouthed.
<div class="bookquote">``Hello?''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``Bella? Bella?''  (<font color='red'><b>mother</b></font>)</div>It was my mother's voice, in a familiar tone I had heard a thousand times in my childhood,
anytime I'd gotten too close to the edge of the sidewalk or strayed out of her (<font color='blue'><b>Alice</b></font>) sight in a crowded place. It
was the sound of panic.
I sighed. I'd been expecting this, though I'd tried to make my message as unalarming as possible without
lessening the urgency of it.
<div class="bookquote">``Calm down, Mom,''  (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div>I said in my most soothing voice, walking slowly away from Alice. I wasn't sure if I
could lie as convincingly with her (<font color='blue'><b>Alice</b></font>) eyes on me. <div class="bookquote">``Everything is fine, okay? Just give me a minute and I'll
explain everything, I promise.''
 (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div>I paused, surprised that she (<font color='blue'><b>Alice</b></font>) hadn't interrupted me yet.
<div class="bookquote">``Mom?''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``Be very careful not to say anything until I tell you to.''  (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div>The voice I heard now was as unfamiliar as it was
unexpected. It was a man's tenor voice, a very pleasant, generic voice  the kind of voice that you
heard in the background of luxury car commercials. He (<font color='blue'><b>tenor</b></font>) spoke very quickly.
<div class="bookquote">``Now, I don't need to hurt your mother, so please do exactly as I say, and she (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>)'ll be fine.''  (<font color='red'><b>He</b></font>)</div>He (<font color='blue'><b>tenor</b></font>) paused for
a minute while I listened in mute horror. <div class="bookquote">``That's very good,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>tenor</b></font>) congratulated. ``Now repeat after me, and
do try to sound natural. Please say, ``No, Mom, stay where you are.'''
``No, Mom, stay where you are.'' My voice was barely more than a whisper.
``I can see this is going to be difficult.'' The voice was amused, still light and friendly. ``Why don't you walk
into another room now so your face doesn't ruin everything? There's no reason for your mother to suffer.
As you're walking, please say, <div class="bookquote">``Mom, please listen to me.''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>Say it now.''
``Mom, please listen to me,'' my voice pleaded. I walked very slowly to the bedroom, feeling Alice's
worried stare on my back. I shut the door behind me, trying to think clearly through the terror that
gripped my brain.
<div class="bookquote">``There now, are you alone? Just answer yes or no.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Yes.''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``But they can still hear you, I'm sure.''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``Yes.''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``All right, then,''  (<font color='red'><b>Mom</b></font>)</div>the agreeable voice continued, ``say, ``Mom, trust me.'''
``Mom, trust me.''
``This worked out rather better than I expected. I was prepared to wait, but your mother arrived ahead of
schedule. It's easier this way, isn't it? Less suspense, less anxiety for you.''
I waited.
``Now I want you to listen very carefully. I'm going to need you to get away from your friends; do you
think you can do that? Answer yes or no.''
``No.''
``I'm sorry to hear that. I was hoping you would be a little more creative than that. Do you think you could
get away from them if your mother's life depended on it? Answer yes or no.''
Somehow, there had to be a way. I remembered that we were going to the airport. Sky Harbor
International Airport: crowded, confusingly laid out
``Yes.''
``That's better. I'm sure it won't be easy, but if I get the slightest hint that you have any company, well, that
would be very bad for your mother,'' the friendly voice promised. ``You must know enough about us by
now to realize how quickly I would know if you tried to bring anyone along with you. And how little time
I would need to deal with your mother if that was the case. Do you understand? Answer yes or no.''
``Yes.'' My voice broke.
``Very good, Bella. Now this is what you have to do. I want you to go to your mother's house. Next to
the phone there will be a number. Call it, and I'll tell you where to go from there.'' I already knew where I
would go, and where this would end. But I would follow his (<font color='blue'><b>I</b></font>) instructions exactly. ``Can you do that?
Answer yes or no.''
``Yes.''
``Before noon, please, Bella. I haven't got all day,'' he (<font color='blue'><b>I</b></font>) said politely.
``Where's Phil?'' I asked tersely.
``Ah, be careful now, Bella. Wait until I ask you to speak, please.''
I waited.
``It's important, now, that you don't make your friends suspicious when you go back to them. Tell them
that your mother called, and that you talked her (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) out of coming home for the time being. Now repeat after
me, <div class="bookquote">``Thank you, Mom.''  (<font color='red'><b>me</b></font>)</div>Say it now.''
<div class="bookquote">``Thank you, Mom.''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>The tears were coming. I tried to fight them back.

<p/>``Say, ``I love you, Mom, I'll see you soon.<div class="bookquote">'' Say it now.''
 (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``I love you, Mom.''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>My voice was thick. <div class="bookquote">``I'll see you soon,''  (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div>I promised.
<div class="bookquote">``Goodbye, Bella. I look forward to seeing you again.''  (<font color='red'><b>He</b></font>)</div>He (<font color='blue'><b>I</b></font>) hung up.
I held the phone to my ear. My joints were frozen with terror  I couldn't unbend my fingers to drop it.
I knew I had to think, but my head was filled with the sound of my mother's panic. Seconds ticked by
while I fought for control.
Slowly, slowly, my thoughts started to break past that brick wall of pain. To plan. For I had no choices
now but one: to go to the mirrored room and die. I had no guarantees, nothing to give to keep my mother
alive. I could only hope that James would be satisfied with winning the game, that beating Edward would
be enough. Despair gripped me; there was no way to bargain, nothing I could offer or withhold that could
influence him (<font color='blue'><b>Edward</b></font>). But I still had no choice. I had to try.
I pushed the terror back as well as I could. My decision was made. It did no good to waste time
agonizing over the outcome. I had to think clearly, because Alice and Jasper were waiting for me, and
evading them was absolutely essential, and absolutely impossible.
I was suddenly grateful that Jasper was gone. If he (<font color='blue'><b>Jasper</b></font>) had been here to feel my anguish in the last five
minutes, how could I have kept them from being suspicious? I choked back the dread, the anxiety, tried
to stifle it. I couldn't afford it now. I didn't know when he (<font color='blue'><b>Jasper</b></font>) would return.
I concentrated on my escape. I had to hope that my familiarity with the airport would turn the odds in my
favor. Somehow, I had to keep Alice away
I knew Alice was in the other room waiting for me, curious. But I had to deal with one more thing in
private, before Jasper was back.
I had to accept that I wouldn't see Edward again, not even one last glimpse of his (<font color='blue'><b>Edward</b></font>) face to carry with me
to the mirror room. I was going to hurt him (<font color='blue'><b>Edward</b></font>), and I couldn't say goodbye. I let the waves of torture wash
over me, have their way for a time. Then I pushed them back, too, and went to face Alice.
The only expression I could manage was a dull, dead look. I saw her (<font color='blue'><b>Alice</b></font>) alarm and I didn't wait for her (<font color='blue'><b>Alice</b></font>) to
ask. I had just one script and I'd never manage improvisation now.
<div class="bookquote">``My mom was worried, she (<font color='blue'><b>mom</b></font>) wanted to come home. But it's okay, I convinced her (<font color='blue'><b>mom</b></font>) to stay away.''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>My
voice was lifeless.
<div class="bookquote">``We'll make sure she (<font color='blue'><b>mom</b></font>)'s fine, Bella, don't worry.''
 (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div>I turned away; I couldn't let her (<font color='blue'><b>Alice</b></font>) see my face.
My eye fell on a blank page of the hotel stationery on the desk. I went to it slowly, a plan forming. There
was an envelope there, too. That was good.
<div class="bookquote">``Alice,''  (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div>I asked slowly, without turning, keeping my voice level. <div class="bookquote">``If I write a letter for my mother, would
you give it to her (<font color='blue'><b>Alice</b></font>)? Leave it at the house, I mean.''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``Sure, Bella.''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>Her (<font color='blue'><b>Alice</b></font>) voice was careful. She (<font color='blue'><b>Alice</b></font>) could see me coming apart at the seams. I had to keep my
emotions under better control.
I went into the bedroom again, and knelt next to the little bedside table to write.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Edward,''  (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div>I wrote. My hand was shaking, the letters were hardly legible.

<p/>I love you. I am so sorry. He (<font color='blue'><b>I</b></font>) has my mom, and I have to try. I know it may not work. I am so very,
very sorry.
Don't be angry with Alice and Jasper. If I get away from them it will be a miracle. Tell them thank
you for me. Alice especially, please.
And please, please, don't come after him (<font color='blue'><b>Jasper</b></font>). That's what he (<font color='blue'><b>Jasper</b></font>) wants. I think. I can't bear it if anyone
has to be hurt because of me, especially you. Please, this is the only thing I can ask you now. For
me.
I love you. Forgive me.
Bella

<p/>I folded the letter carefully, and sealed it in the envelope. Eventually he (<font color='blue'><b>Jasper</b></font>) would find it. I only hoped he (<font color='blue'><b>Jasper</b></font>)
would understand, and listen to me just this once.
And then I carefully sealed away my heart.

<p/>22. HIDE-AND-SEEK

<p/>It had taken much less time than I'd thought  all the terror, the despair, the shattering of my heart. The
minutes were ticking by more slowly than usual. Jasper still hadn't come back when I returned to Alice. I
was afraid to be in the same room with her (<font color='blue'><b>Alice</b></font>), afraid that she (<font color='blue'><b>Alice</b></font>) would guess and afraid to hide from her (<font color='blue'><b>Alice</b></font>) for
the same reason.
I would have thought I was far beyond the ability to be surprised, my thoughts tortured and unstable, but
I was surprised when I saw Alice bent over the desk, gripping the edge with two hands.
<div class="bookquote">``Alice?''
 (<font color='red'><b>She</b></font>)</div>She (<font color='blue'><b>Alice</b></font>) didn't react when I called her (<font color='blue'><b>Alice</b></font>) name, but her (<font color='blue'><b>Alice</b></font>) head was slowly rocking side to side, and I saw her (<font color='blue'><b>Alice</b></font>)
face. Her (<font color='blue'><b>Alice</b></font>) eyes were blank, dazed My thoughts flew to my mother. Was I already too late?
I hurried to her (<font color='blue'><b>Alice</b></font>) side, reaching out automatically to touch her (<font color='blue'><b>Alice</b></font>) hand.
<div class="bookquote">``Alice!''  (<font color='red'><b>Jasper</b></font>)</div>Jasper's voice whipped, and then he (<font color='blue'><b>Jasper</b></font>) was right behind her (<font color='blue'><b>Alice</b></font>), his (<font color='blue'><b>Jasper</b></font>) hands curling over hers, loosening
them from their grip on the table. Across the room, the door swung shut with a low click.
<div class="bookquote">``What is it?''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Jasper</b></font>) demanded.
She (<font color='blue'><b>Alice</b></font>) turned her (<font color='blue'><b>Alice</b></font>) face away from me, into his (<font color='blue'><b>Jasper</b></font>) chest. <div class="bookquote">``Bella,''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Alice</b></font>) said.
<div class="bookquote">``I'm right here,''  (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div>I replied.
Her (<font color='blue'><b>Alice</b></font>) head twisted around, her (<font color='blue'><b>Alice</b></font>) eyes locking on mine, their expression still strangely blank. I realized at

<p/>once that she (<font color='blue'><b>Alice</b></font>) hadn't been speaking to me, she (<font color='blue'><b>Alice</b></font>)'d been answering Jasper's question.
<div class="bookquote">``What did you see?''  (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div>I said  and there was no question in my flat, uncaring voice.
Jasper looked at me sharply. I kept my expression vacant and waited. His (<font color='blue'><b>Jasper</b></font>) eyes were confused as they
flickered swiftly between Alice's face and mine, feeling the chaos for I could guess what Alice had
seen now.
I felt a tranquil atmosphere settle around me. I welcomed it, using it to keep my emotions disciplined,
under control.
Alice, too, recovered herself.
<div class="bookquote">``Nothing, really,''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Alice</b></font>) answered finally, her (<font color='blue'><b>Alice</b></font>) voice remarkably calm and convincing. <div class="bookquote">``Just the same room
as before.''
 (<font color='red'><b>She</b></font>)</div>She (<font color='blue'><b>Alice</b></font>) finally looked at me, her (<font color='blue'><b>Alice</b></font>) expression smooth and withdrawn. <div class="bookquote">``Did you want breakfast?''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``No, I'll eat at the airport.''  (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div>I was very calm, too. I went to the bathroom to shower. Almost as if I were
borrowing Jasper's strange extra sense, I could feel Alice's wild  though well-concealed 
desperation to have me out of the room, to be alone with Jasper. So she (<font color='blue'><b>Alice</b></font>) could tell him (<font color='blue'><b>Jasper</b></font>) that they were
doing something wrong, that they were going to fail
I got ready methodically, concentrating on each little task. I left my hair down, swirling around me,
covering my face. The peaceful mood Jasper created worked its way through me and helped me think
clearly. Helped me plan. I dug through my bag until I found my sock full of money. I emptied it into my
pocket.
I was anxious to get to the airport, and glad when we left by seven. I sat alone this time in the back of the
dark car. Alice leaned against the door, her (<font color='blue'><b>Alice</b></font>) face toward Jasper but, behind her (<font color='blue'><b>Alice</b></font>) sunglasses, shooting
glances in my direction every few seconds.
<div class="bookquote">``Alice?''  (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div>I asked indifferently.
She (<font color='blue'><b>Alice</b></font>) was wary. <div class="bookquote">``Yes?''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``How does it work? The things that you see?''  (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div>I stared out the side window, and my voice sounded
bored. <div class="bookquote">``Edward said it wasn't definite that things change?''  (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div>It was harder than I would have thought to
say his (<font color='blue'><b>Jasper</b></font>) name. That must have been what alerted Jasper, why a fresh wave of serenity filled the car.
<div class="bookquote">``Yes, things change''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Alice</b></font>) murmured  hopefully, I thought. <div class="bookquote">``Some things are more certain than
others like the weather. People are harder. I only see the course they're on while they're on it. Once
they change their minds  make a new decision, no matter how small  the whole future shifts.''
 (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div>I nodded thoughtfully. <div class="bookquote">``So you couldn't see James in Phoenix until he (<font color='blue'><b>James</b></font>) decided to come here.''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``Yes,''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Alice</b></font>) agreed, wary again.
And she (<font color='blue'><b>Alice</b></font>) hadn't seen me in the mirror room with James until I'd made the decision to meet him (<font color='blue'><b>James</b></font>) there. I
tried not to think about what else she (<font color='blue'><b>Alice</b></font>) might have seen. I didn't want my panic to make Jasper more
suspicious. They would be watching me twice as carefully now, anyway, after Alice's vision. This was
going to be impossible.
We got to the airport. Luck was with me, or maybe it was just good odds. Edward's plane was landing

<p/>in terminal four, the largest terminal, where most flights landed  so it wasn't surprising that his (<font color='blue'><b>Edward</b></font>) was. But
it was the terminal I needed: the biggest, the most confusing. And there was a door on level three that
might be the only chance.
We parked on the fourth floor of the huge garage. I led the way, for once more knowledgeable about my
surroundings than they were. We took the elevator down to level three, where the passengers unloaded.
Alice and Jasper spent a long time looking at the departing flights board. I could hear them discussing the
pros and cons of New York, Atlanta, Chicago. Places I'd never seen. And would never see.
I waited for my opportunity, impatient, unable to stop my toe from tapping. We sat in the long rows of
chairs by the metal detectors, Jasper and Alice pretending to people-watch but really watching me. Every
inch I shifted in my seat was followed by a quick glance out of the corner of their eyes. It was hopeless.
Should I run? Would they dare to stop me physically in this public place? Or would they simply follow?
I pulled the unmarked envelope out of my pocket and set it on top of Alice's black leather bag. She (<font color='blue'><b>Alice</b></font>)
looked at me.
<div class="bookquote">``My letter,''  (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div>I said. She (<font color='blue'><b>Alice</b></font>) nodded, tucking it under the top flap. He (<font color='blue'><b>Jasper</b></font>) would find it soon enough.
The minutes passed and Edward's arrival grew closer. It was amazing how every cell in my body seemed
to know he (<font color='blue'><b>Edward</b></font>) was coming, to long for his (<font color='blue'><b>Edward</b></font>) coming. That made it very hard. I found myself trying to think of
excuses to stay, to see him (<font color='blue'><b>Edward</b></font>) first and then make my escape. But I knew that was impossible if I was going
to have any chance to get away.
Several times Alice offered to go get breakfast with me. Later, I told her (<font color='blue'><b>Alice</b></font>), not yet.
I stared at the arrival board, watching as flight after flight arrived on time. The flight from Seattle crept
closer to the top of the board.
And then, when I had only thirty minutes to make my escape, the numbers changed. His (<font color='blue'><b>Edward</b></font>) plane was ten
minutes early. I had no more time.
<div class="bookquote">``I think I'll eat now,''  (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div>I said quickly.
Alice stood. <div class="bookquote">``I'll come with you.''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``Do you mind if Jasper comes instead?''  (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div>I asked. <div class="bookquote">``I'm feeling a little''  (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div>I didn't finish the sentence. My
eyes were wild enough to convey what I didn't say.
Jasper stood up. Alice's eyes were confused, but  I saw to my relief not suspicious. She (<font color='blue'><b>Alice</b></font>) must be
attributing the change in her (<font color='blue'><b>Alice</b></font>) vision to some maneuver of the tracker's rather than a betrayal by me.
Jasper walked silently beside me, his (<font color='blue'><b>Jasper</b></font>) hand on the small of my back, as if he (<font color='blue'><b>Jasper</b></font>) were guiding me. I pretended
a lack of interest in the first few airport cafes, my head scanning for what I really wanted. And there it
was, around the corner, out of Alice's sharp sight: the level-three ladies' room.
<div class="bookquote">``Do you mind?''  (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div>I asked Jasper as we passed. <div class="bookquote">``I'll just be a moment.''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``I'll be right here,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Jasper</b></font>) said.
As soon as the door shut behind me, I was running. I remembered the time I had gotten lost from this
bathroom, because it had two exits.
Outside the far door it was only a short sprint to the elevators, and if Jasper stayed where he (<font color='blue'><b>Jasper</b></font>) said he (<font color='blue'><b>Jasper</b></font>)

<p/>would, I'd never be in his (<font color='blue'><b>Jasper</b></font>) line of sight. I didn't look behind me as I ran. This was my only chance, and
even if he (<font color='blue'><b>Jasper</b></font>) saw me, I had to keep going. People stared, but I ignored them. Around the corner the
elevators were waiting, and I dashed forward, throwing my hand between the closing doors of a full
elevator headed down. I squeezed in beside the irritated passengers, and checked to make sure that the
button for level one had been pushed. It was already lit, and the doors closed.
As soon as the door opened I was off again, to the sound of annoyed murmurs behind me. I slowed
myself as I passed the security guards by the luggage carousels, only to break into a run again as the exit
doors came into view. I had no way of knowing if Jasper was looking for me yet.
I would have only seconds if he (<font color='blue'><b>Jasper</b></font>) was following my scent. I jumped out the automatic doors, nearly
smacking into the glass when they opened too slowly.
Along the crowded curb there wasn't a cab in sight.
I had no time. Alice and Jasper were either about to realize I was gone, or they already had. They would
find me in a heartbeat.
A shuttle to the Hyatt was just closing its doors a few feet behind me.
<div class="bookquote">``Wait!''  (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div>I called, running, waving at the driver.
<div class="bookquote">``This is the shuttle to the Hyatt,''  (<font color='red'><b>the driver</b></font>)</div>the driver said in confusion as he (<font color='blue'><b>driver</b></font>) opened the doors.
<div class="bookquote">``Yes,''  (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div>I huffed, <div class="bookquote">``that's where I'm going.''  (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div>I hurried up the steps.
He (<font color='blue'><b>driver</b></font>) looked askance at my luggage-less state, but then shrugged, not caring enough to ask.
Most of the seats were empty. I sat as far from the other travelers as possible, and watched out the
window as first the sidewalk, and then the airport, drifted away. I couldn't help imagining Edward, where
he (<font color='blue'><b>Edward</b></font>) would stand at the edge of the road when he (<font color='blue'><b>Edward</b></font>) found the end of my trail. I couldn't cry yet, I told myself.
I still had a long way to go.
My luck held. In front of the Hyatt, a tired-looking couple was getting their last suitcase out of the trunk
of a cab. I jumped out of the shuttle and ran to the cab, sliding into the seat behind the driver. The tired
couple and the shuttle driver stared at me.
I told the surprised cabbie my mother's address. <div class="bookquote">``I need to get there as soon as possible.''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``That's in Scottsdale,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>driver</b></font>) complained.
I threw four twenties over the seat.
<div class="bookquote">``Will that be enough?''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``Sure, kid, no problem.''
 (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div>I sat back against the seat, folding my arms across my lap. The familiar city began to rush around me, but
I didn't look out the windows. I exerted myself to maintain control. I was determined not to lose myself at
this point, now that my plan was successfully completed. There was no point in indulging in more terror,
more anxiety. My path was set. I just had to follow it now.
So, instead of panicking, I closed my eyes and spent the twenty minutes' drive with Edward.
I imagined that I had stayed at the airport to meet Edward. I visualized how I would stand on my toes,

<p/>the sooner to see his (<font color='blue'><b>Edward</b></font>) face. How quickly, how gracefully he (<font color='blue'><b>Edward</b></font>) would move through the crowds of people
separating us. And then I would run to close those last few feet between us  reckless as always  and
I would be in his (<font color='blue'><b>Edward</b></font>) marble arms, finally safe.
I wondered where we would have gone. North somewhere, so he (<font color='blue'><b>Edward</b></font>) could be outside in the day. Or maybe
somewhere very remote, so we could lay in the sun together again. I imagined him (<font color='blue'><b>Edward</b></font>) by the shore, his (<font color='blue'><b>Edward</b></font>) skin
sparkling like the sea. It wouldn't matter how long we had to hide. To be trapped in a hotel room with
him (<font color='blue'><b>Edward</b></font>) would be a kind of heaven. So many questions I still had for him (<font color='blue'><b>Edward</b></font>). I could talk to him (<font color='blue'><b>Edward</b></font>) forever, never
sleeping, never leaving his (<font color='blue'><b>Edward</b></font>) side.
I could see his (<font color='blue'><b>Edward</b></font>) face so clearly now almost hear his (<font color='blue'><b>Edward</b></font>) voice. And, despite all the horror and hopelessness,
I was fleetingly happy. So involved was I in my escapist daydreams, I lost all track of the seconds racing
by.
<div class="bookquote">``Hey, what was the number?''
 (<font color='red'><b>The cabbie</b></font>)</div>The cabbie's question punctured my fantasy, letting all the colors run out of my lovely delusions. Fear,
bleak and hard, was waiting to fill the empty space they left behind.
<div class="bookquote">``Fifty-eight twenty-one.''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>My voice sounded strangled. The cabbie looked at me, nervous that I was
having an episode or something.
<div class="bookquote">``Here we are, then.''  (<font color='red'><b>He</b></font>)</div>He (<font color='blue'><b>cabbie</b></font>) was anxious to get me out of his (<font color='blue'><b>cabbie</b></font>) car, probably hoping I wouldn't ask for my
change.
<div class="bookquote">``Thank you,''  (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div>I whispered. There was no need to be afraid, I reminded myself. The house was empty. I
had to hurry; my mom was waiting for me, frightened, depending on me.
I ran to the door, reaching up automatically to grab the key under the eave. I unlocked the door. It was
dark inside, empty, normal. I ran to the phone, turning on the kitchen light on my way. There, on the
whiteboard, was a ten-digit number written in a small, neat hand. My fingers stumbled over the keypad,
making mistakes. I had to hang up and start again. I concentrated only on the buttons this time, carefully
pressing each one in turn. I was successful. I held the phone to my ear with a shaking hand. It rang only
once.
<div class="bookquote">``Hello, Bella,''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>that easy voice answered. <div class="bookquote">``That was very quick. I'm impressed.''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``Is my mom all right?''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``She (<font color='blue'><b>mom</b></font>)'s perfectly fine. Don't worry, Bella, I have no quarrel with her (<font color='blue'><b>Bella</b></font>). Unless you didn't come alone, of
course.''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>Light, amused.
<div class="bookquote">``I'm alone.''  (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div>I'd never been more alone in my entire life.
<div class="bookquote">``Very good. Now, do you know the ballet studio just around the corner from your home?''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``Yes. I know how to get there.''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``Well, then, I'll see you very soon.''
 (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div>I hung up.
I ran from the room, through the door, out into the baking heat.
There was no time to look back at my house, and I didn't want to see it as it was now  empty, a

<p/>symbol of fear instead of sanctuary. The last person to walk through those familiar rooms was my enemy.
From the corner of my eye, I could almost see my mother standing in the shade of the big eucalyptus tree
where I'd played as a child. Or kneeling by the little plot of dirt around the mailbox, the cemetery of all
the flowers she (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>)'d tried to grow. The memories were better than any reality I would see today. But I raced
away from them, toward the corner, leaving everything behind me.
I felt so slow, like I was running through wet sand  I couldn't seem to get enough purchase from the
concrete. I tripped several times, once falling, catching myself with my hands, scraping them on the
sidewalk, and then lurching up to plunge forward again. But at last I made it to the corner. Just another
street now; I ran, sweat pouring down my face, gasping. The sun was hot on my skin, too bright as it
bounced off the white concrete and blinded me. I felt dangerously exposed. More fiercely than I would
have dreamed I was capable of, I wished for the green, protective forests of Forks of home.
When I rounded the last corner, onto Cactus, I could see the studio, looking just as I remembered it. The
parking lot in front was empty, the vertical blinds in all the windows drawn. I couldn't run anymore  I
couldn't breathe; exertion and fear had gotten the best of me. I thought of my mother to keep my feet
moving, one in front of the other.
As I got closer, I could see the sign inside the door. It was handwritten on hot pink paper; it said the
dance studio was closed for spring break. I touched the handle, tugged on it cautiously. It was unlocked.
I fought to catch my breath, and opened the door.
The lobby was dark and empty, cool, the air conditioner thrumming. The plastic molded chairs were
stacked along the walls, and the carpet smelled like shampoo. The west dance floor was dark, I could
see through the open viewing window. The east dance floor, the bigger room, was lit. But the blinds were
closed on the window.
Terror seized me so strongly that I was literally trapped by it. I couldn't make my feet move forward.
And then my mother's voice called.
<div class="bookquote">``Bella? Bella?''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>That same tone of hysterical panic. I sprinted to the door, to the sound of her (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) voice.
<div class="bookquote">``Bella, you scared me! Don't you ever do that to me again!''  (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div>Her (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) voice continued as I ran into the long,
high-ceilinged room.
I stared around me, trying to find where her (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) voice was coming from. I heard her (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) laugh, and I whirled to
the sound.
There she (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) was, on the TV screen, tousling my hair in relief. It was Thanksgiving, and I was twelve. We'd
gone to see my grandmother in California, the last year before she (<font color='blue'><b>grandmother</b></font>) died. We went to the beach one day,
and I'd leaned too far over the edge of the pier. She (<font color='blue'><b>grandmother</b></font>)'d seen my feet flailing, trying to reclaim my balance.
<div class="bookquote">``Bella? Bella?''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>grandmother</b></font>)'d called to me in fear.
And then the TV screen was blue.
I turned slowly. He (<font color='blue'><b>grandmother</b></font>) was standing very still by the back exit, so still I hadn't noticed him (<font color='blue'><b>grandmother</b></font>) at first. In his (<font color='blue'><b>grandmother</b></font>) hand
was a remote control. We stared at each other for a long moment, and then he (<font color='blue'><b>grandmother</b></font>) smiled.
He (<font color='blue'><b>grandmother</b></font>) walked toward me, quite close, and then passed me to put the remote down next to the VCR. I
turned carefully to watch him (<font color='blue'><b>grandmother</b></font>).
<div class="bookquote">``Sorry about that, Bella, but isn't it better that your mother didn't really have to be involved in all this?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/>His (<font color='blue'><b>grandmother</b></font>) voice was courteous, kind.
And suddenly it hit me. My mother was safe. She (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) was still in Florida. She (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>)'d never gotten my message.
She (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>)'d never been terrified by the dark red eyes in the abnormally pale face before me. She (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) was safe.
<div class="bookquote">``Yes,''  (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div>I answered, my voice saturated with relief.
<div class="bookquote">``You don't sound angry that I tricked you.''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``I'm not.''  (<font color='red'><b>me</b></font>)</div>My sudden high made me brave. What did it matter now? It would soon be over. Charlie and
Mom would never be harmed, would never have to fear. I felt almost giddy. Some analytical part of my
mind warned me that I was dangerously close to snapping from the stress.
<div class="bookquote">``How odd. You really mean it.''  (<font color='red'><b>me</b></font>)</div>His (<font color='blue'><b>Charlie</b></font>) dark eyes assessed me with interest. The irises were nearly black,
just a hint of ruby around the edges. Thirsty. <div class="bookquote">``I will give your strange coven this much, you humans can be
quite interesting. I guess I can see the draw of observing you. It's amazing  some of you seem to have
no sense of your own self-interest at all.''
 (<font color='red'><b>He</b></font>)</div>He (<font color='blue'><b>Charlie</b></font>) was standing a few feet away from me, arms folded, looking at me curiously. There was no menace in
his (<font color='blue'><b>Charlie</b></font>) face or stance. He (<font color='blue'><b>Charlie</b></font>) was so very average-looking, nothing remarkable about his (<font color='blue'><b>Charlie</b></font>) face or body at all.
Just the white skin, the circled eyes I'd grown so used to. He (<font color='blue'><b>Charlie</b></font>) wore a pale blue, long-sleeved shirt and
faded blue jeans.
<div class="bookquote">``I suppose you're going to tell me that your boyfriend will avenge you?''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Charlie</b></font>) asked, hopefully it seemed to
me.
<div class="bookquote">``No, I don't think so. At least, I asked him (<font color='blue'><b>boyfriend</b></font>) not to.''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``And what was his (<font color='blue'><b>boyfriend</b></font>) reply to that?''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``I don't know.''  (<font color='red'><b>this hunter</b></font>)</div>It was strangely easy to converse with this genteel hunter. <div class="bookquote">``I left him (<font color='blue'><b>boyfriend</b></font>) a letter.''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``How romantic, a last letter. And do you think he (<font color='blue'><b>boyfriend</b></font>) will honor it?''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>His (<font color='blue'><b>hunter</b></font>) voice was just a little harder now, a
hint of sarcasm marring his (<font color='blue'><b>hunter</b></font>) polite tone.
<div class="bookquote">``I hope so.''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``Hmmm. Well, our hopes differ then. You see, this was all just a little too easy, too quick. To be quite
honest, I'm disappointed. I expected a much greater challenge. And, after all, I only needed a little luck.''
 (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div>I waited in silence.
``When Victoria couldn't get to your father, I had her (<font color='blue'><b>Victoria</b></font>) find out more about you. There was no sense in
running all over the planet chasing you down when I could comfortably wait for you in a place of my
choosing. So, after I talked to Victoria, I decided to come to Phoenix to pay your mother a visit. I'd
heard you say you were going home. At first, I never dreamed you meant it. But then I wondered.
Humans can be very predictable; they like to be somewhere familiar, somewhere safe. And wouldn't it be
the perfect ploy, to go to the last place you should be when you're hiding  the place that you said you'd
be.
``But of course I wasn't sure, it was just a hunch. I usually get a feeling about the prey that I'm hunting, a
sixth sense, if you will. I listened to your message when I got to your mother's house, but of course I
couldn't be sure where you'd called from. It was very useful to have your number, but you could have
been in Antarctica for all I knew, and the game wouldn't work unless you were close by.

<p/>``Then your boyfriend got on a plane to Phoenix. Victoria was monitoring them for me, naturally; in a
game with this many players, I couldn't be working alone. And so they told me what I'd hoped, that you
were here after all. I was prepared; I'd already been through your charming home movies. And then it
was simply a matter of the bluff.
``Very easy, you know, not really up to my standards. So, you see, I'm hoping you're wrong about your
boyfriend. Edward, isn't it?''
I didn't answer. The bravado was wearing off. I sensed that he (<font color='blue'><b>hunter</b></font>) was coming to the end of his (<font color='blue'><b>hunter</b></font>) gloat. It
wasn't meant for me anyway. There was no glory in beating me, a weak human.
``Would you mind, very much, if I left a little letter of my own for your Edward?''
He (<font color='blue'><b>hunter</b></font>) took a step back and touched a palm-sized digital video camera balanced carefully on top of the
stereo. A small red light indicated that it was already running. He (<font color='blue'><b>hunter</b></font>) adjusted it a few times, widened the
frame. I stared at him (<font color='blue'><b>hunter</b></font>) in horror.
``I'm sorry, but I just don't think he (<font color='blue'><b>Edward</b></font>)'ll be able to resist hunting me after he (<font color='blue'><b>Edward</b></font>) watches this. And I wouldn't
want him (<font color='blue'><b>Edward</b></font>) to miss anything. It was all for him (<font color='blue'><b>Edward</b></font>), of course. You're simply a human, who unfortunately was in
the wrong place, at the wrong time, and indisputably running with the wrong crowd, I might add.''
He (<font color='blue'><b>hunter</b></font>) stepped toward me, smiling. ``Before we begin''
I felt a curl of nausea in the pit of my stomach as he (<font color='blue'><b>hunter</b></font>) spoke. This was something I had not anticipated.
``I would just like to rub it in, just a little bit. The answer was there all along, and I was so afraid Edward
would see that and ruin my fun. It happened once, oh, ages ago. The one and only time my prey escaped
me.
<div class="bookquote">``You see, the vampire who was so stupidly fond of this little victim made the choice that your Edward
was too weak to make. When the old one knew I was after his (<font color='blue'><b>Edward</b></font>) little friend, he (<font color='blue'><b>Edward</b></font>) stole her (<font color='blue'><b>we</b></font>) from the asylum
where he (<font color='blue'><b>Edward</b></font>) worked  I never will understand the obsession some vampires seem to form with you
humans  and as soon as he (<font color='blue'><b>Edward</b></font>) freed her (<font color='blue'><b>we</b></font>) he (<font color='blue'><b>Edward</b></font>) made her (<font color='blue'><b>we</b></font>) safe. She (<font color='blue'><b>we</b></font>) didn't even seem to notice the pain, poor
little creature. She (<font color='blue'><b>we</b></font>)'d been stuck in that black hole of a cell for so long. A hundred years earlier and she (<font color='blue'><b>we</b></font>)
would have been burned at the stake for her (<font color='blue'><b>we</b></font>) visions. In the nineteen-twenties it was the asylum and the
shock treatments. When she (<font color='blue'><b>we</b></font>) opened her (<font color='blue'><b>we</b></font>) eyes, strong with her (<font color='blue'><b>we</b></font>) fresh youth, it was like she (<font color='blue'><b>we</b></font>)'d never seen
the sun before. The old vampire made her (<font color='blue'><b>we</b></font>) a strong new vampire, and there was no reason for me to
touch her (<font color='blue'><b>we</b></font>) then.''  (<font color='red'><b>He</b></font>)</div>He (<font color='blue'><b>hunter</b></font>) sighed. <div class="bookquote">``I destroyed the old one in vengeance.''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``Alice,''  (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div>I breathed, astonished.
``Yes, your little friend. I was surprised to see her (<font color='blue'><b>Alice</b></font>) in the clearing. So I guess her (<font color='blue'><b>Alice</b></font>) coven ought to be able to
derive some comfort from this experience. I get you, but they get her (<font color='blue'><b>Alice</b></font>). The one victim who escaped me,
quite an honor, actually.
``And she (<font color='blue'><b>Alice</b></font>) did smell so delicious. I still regret that I never got to taste She (<font color='blue'><b>Alice</b></font>) smelled even better than you
do. Sorry  I don't mean to be offensive. You have a very nice smell. Floral, somehow''
He (<font color='blue'><b>hunter</b></font>) took another step toward me, till he (<font color='blue'><b>hunter</b></font>) was just inches away. He (<font color='blue'><b>hunter</b></font>) lifted a lock of my hair and sniffed at it
delicately. Then he (<font color='blue'><b>hunter</b></font>) gently patted the strand back into place, and I felt his (<font color='blue'><b>hunter</b></font>) cool fingertips against my throat.
He (<font color='blue'><b>hunter</b></font>) reached up to stroke my cheek once quickly with his (<font color='blue'><b>hunter</b></font>) thumb, his (<font color='blue'><b>hunter</b></font>) face curious. I wanted so badly to
run, but I was frozen. I couldn't even flinch away.
``No,'' he (<font color='blue'><b>hunter</b></font>) murmured to himself as he (<font color='blue'><b>hunter</b></font>) dropped his (<font color='blue'><b>hunter</b></font>) hand, ``I don't understand.'' He (<font color='blue'><b>hunter</b></font>) sighed. ``Well, I suppose

<p/>we should get on with it. And then I can call your friends and tell them where to find you, and my little
message.''
I was definitely sick now. There was pain coming, I could see it in his (<font color='blue'><b>hunter</b></font>) eyes. It wouldn't be enough for him (<font color='blue'><b>hunter</b></font>)
to win, to feed and go. There would be no quick end like I'd been counting on. My knees began to
shake, and I was afraid I was going to fall.
He (<font color='blue'><b>hunter</b></font>) stepped back, and began to circle, casually, as if he (<font color='blue'><b>hunter</b></font>) were trying to get a better view of a statue in a
museum. His (<font color='blue'><b>hunter</b></font>) face was still open and friendly as he (<font color='blue'><b>hunter</b></font>) decided where to start.
Then he (<font color='blue'><b>hunter</b></font>) slumped forward, into a crouch I recognized, and his (<font color='blue'><b>hunter</b></font>) pleasant smile slowly widened, grew, till it
wasn't a smile at all but a contortion of teeth, exposed and glistening.
I couldn't help myself I tried to run. As useless as I knew it would be, as weak as my knees already
were, panic took over and I bolted for the emergency door.
He (<font color='blue'><b>hunter</b></font>) was in front of me in a flash. I didn't see if he (<font color='blue'><b>hunter</b></font>) used his (<font color='blue'><b>hunter</b></font>) hand or his (<font color='blue'><b>hunter</b></font>) foot, it was too fast. A crushing
blow struck my chest  I felt myself flying backward, and then heard the crunch as my head bashed into
the mirrors. The glass buckled, some of the pieces shattering and splintering on the floor beside me.
I was too stunned to feel the pain. I couldn't breathe yet.
He (<font color='blue'><b>hunter</b></font>) walked toward me slowly.
``That's a very nice effect,'' he (<font color='blue'><b>hunter</b></font>) said, examining the mess of glass, his (<font color='blue'><b>hunter</b></font>) voice friendly again. ``I thought this
room would be visually dramatic for my little film. That's why I picked this place to meet you. It's perfect,
isn't it?''
I ignored him (<font color='blue'><b>hunter</b></font>), scrambling on my hands and knees, crawling toward the other door.
He (<font color='blue'><b>hunter</b></font>) was over me at once, his (<font color='blue'><b>hunter</b></font>) foot stepping down hard on my leg. I heard the sickening snap before I felt
it. But then I did feel it, and I couldn't hold back my scream of agony. I twisted up to reach for my leg,
and he (<font color='blue'><b>hunter</b></font>) was standing over me, smiling.
``Would you like to rethink your last request?'' he (<font color='blue'><b>hunter</b></font>) asked pleasantly. His (<font color='blue'><b>hunter</b></font>) toe nudged my broken leg and I
heard a piercing scream. With a shock, I realized it was mine.
``Wouldn't you rather have Edward try to find me?'' he (<font color='blue'><b>hunter</b></font>) prompted.
``No!'' I croaked. <div class="bookquote">``No, Edward, don't''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>And then something smashed into my face, throwing me back
into the broken mirrors.
Over the pain of my leg, I felt the sharp rip across my scalp where the glass cut into it. And then the
warm wetness began to spread through my hair with alarming speed. I could feel it soaking the shoulder
of my shirt, hear it dripping on the wood below. The smell of it twisted my stomach.
Through the nausea and dizziness I saw something that gave me a sudden, final shred of hope. His (<font color='blue'><b>I</b></font>) eyes,
merely intent before, now burned with an uncontrollable need. The blood  spreading crimson across
my white shirt, pooling rapidly on the floor  was driving him (<font color='blue'><b>I</b></font>) mad with thirst. No matter his (<font color='blue'><b>I</b></font>) original
intentions, he (<font color='blue'><b>I</b></font>) couldn't draw this out much longer.
Let it be quick now, was all I could hope as the flow of blood from my head sucked my consciousness
away with it. My eyes were closing.

<p/>I heard, as if from underwater, the final growl of the hunter. I could see, through the long tunnels my eyes
had become, his (<font color='blue'><b>hunter</b></font>) dark shape coming toward me. With my last effort, my hand instinctively raised to
protect my face. My eyes closed, and I drifted.

<p/>23. THE ANGEL

<p/>As I drifted, I dreamed.
Where I floated, under the dark water, I heard the happiest sound my mind could conjure up  as
beautiful, as uplifting, as it was ghastly. It was another snarl; a deeper, wilder roar that rang with fury.
I was brought back, almost to the surface, by a sharp pain slashing my upraised hand, but I couldn't find
my way back far enough to open my eyes.
And then I knew I was dead.
Because, through the heavy water, I heard the sound of an angel calling my name, calling me to the only
heaven I wanted.
<div class="bookquote">``Oh no, Bella, no!''  (<font color='red'><b>the angel</b></font>)</div>the angel's voice cried in horror.
Behind that longed-for sound was another noise  an awful tumult that my mind shied away from. A
vicious bass growling, a shocking snapping sound, and a high keening, suddenly breaking off
I tried to concentrate on the angel's voice instead.
<div class="bookquote">``Bella, please! Bella, listen to me, please, please, Bella, please!''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>angel</b></font>) begged.
Yes, I wanted to say. Anything. But I couldn't find my lips.
<div class="bookquote">``Carlisle!''  (<font color='red'><b>the angel</b></font>)</div>the angel called, agony in his (<font color='blue'><b>angel</b></font>) perfect voice. <div class="bookquote">``Bella, Bella, no, oh please, no, no!''  (<font color='red'><b>the angel</b></font>)</div>And the angel
was sobbing tearless, broken sobs.
The angel shouldn't weep, it was wrong. I tried to find him (<font color='blue'><b>angel</b></font>), to tell him (<font color='blue'><b>angel</b></font>) everything was fine, but the water
was so deep, it was pressing on me, and I couldn't breathe.
There was a point of pressure against my head. It hurt. Then, as that pain broke through the darkness to
me, other pains came, stronger pains. I cried out, gasping, breaking through the dark pool.
<div class="bookquote">``Bella!''  (<font color='red'><b>the angel</b></font>)</div>the angel cried.
<div class="bookquote">``She (<font color='blue'><b>Bella</b></font>)'s lost some blood, but the head wound isn't deep,''  (<font color='red'><b>me</b></font>)</div>a calm voice informed me. <div class="bookquote">``Watch out for her (<font color='blue'><b>Bella</b></font>)
leg, it's broken.''
 (<font color='red'><b>the angel</b></font>)</div>A howl of rage strangled on the angel's lips.
I felt a sharp stab in my side. This couldn't be heaven, could it? There was too much pain for that.
<div class="bookquote">``Some ribs, too, I think,''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>the methodical voice continued.
But the sharp pains were fading. There was a new pain, a scalding pain in my hand that was
overshadowing everything else.

<p/>Someone was burning me.
<div class="bookquote">``Edward.''  (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div>I tried to tell him (<font color='blue'><b>angel</b></font>), but my voice was so heavy and slow. I couldn't understand myself.
<div class="bookquote">``Bella, you're going to be fine. Can you hear me, Bella? I love you.''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``Edward,''  (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div>I tried again. My voice was a little clearer.
<div class="bookquote">``Yes, I'm here.''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``It hurts,''  (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div>I whimpered.
<div class="bookquote">``I know, Bella, I know''   (<font color='red'><b>me</b></font>)</div>and then, away from me, anguished  <div class="bookquote">``can't you do anything?''
 (<font color='red'><b>me</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``My bag, please Hold your breath, Alice, it will help,''  (<font color='red'><b>Carlisle</b></font>)</div>Carlisle promised.
<div class="bookquote">``Alice?''  (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div>I groaned.
<div class="bookquote">``She (<font color='blue'><b>Alice</b></font>)'s here, she (<font color='blue'><b>Alice</b></font>) knew where to find you.''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``My hand hurts,''  (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div>I tried to tell him (<font color='blue'><b>Carlisle</b></font>).
<div class="bookquote">``I know, Bella. Carlisle will give you something, it will stop.''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``My hand is burning!''  (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div>I screamed, finally breaking through the last of the darkness, my eyes fluttering
open. I couldn't see his (<font color='blue'><b>Carlisle</b></font>) face, something dark and warm was clouding my eyes. Why couldn't they see the
fire and put it out?
His (<font color='blue'><b>Carlisle</b></font>) voice was frightened. <div class="bookquote">``Bella?''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``The fire! Someone stop the fire!''  (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div>I screamed as it burned me.
<div class="bookquote">``Carlisle! Her (<font color='blue'><b>Bella</b></font>) hand!''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``He (<font color='blue'><b>Carlisle</b></font>) bit her (<font color='blue'><b>Bella</b></font>).''  (<font color='red'><b>Carlisle</b></font>)</div>Carlisle's voice was no longer calm, it was appalled.
I heard Edward catch his (<font color='blue'><b>Edward</b></font>) breath in horror.
<div class="bookquote">``Edward, you have to do it.''  (<font color='red'><b>Alice</b></font>)</div>It was Alice's voice, close by my head. Cool fingers brushed at the wetness
in my eyes.
<div class="bookquote">``No!''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Edward</b></font>) bellowed.
<div class="bookquote">``Alice,''  (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div>I moaned.
<div class="bookquote">``There may be a chance,''  (<font color='red'><b>Carlisle</b></font>)</div>Carlisle said.
<div class="bookquote">``What?''  (<font color='red'><b>Edward/Edward Cullen/Cullen</b></font>)</div>Edward begged.
<div class="bookquote">``See if you can suck the venom back out. The wound is fairly clean.''  (<font color='red'><b>Carlisle</b></font>)</div>As Carlisle spoke, I could feel
more pressure on my head, something poking and pulling at my scalp. The pain of it was lost in the pain
of the fire.
<div class="bookquote">``Will that work?''  (<font color='red'><b>Alice</b></font>)</div>Alice's voice was strained.
<div class="bookquote">``I don't know,''  (<font color='red'><b>Carlisle</b></font>)</div>Carlisle said. <div class="bookquote">``But we have to hurry.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Carlisle, I''  (<font color='red'><b>Edward/Edward Cullen/Cullen</b></font>)</div>Edward hesitated. <div class="bookquote">``I don't know if I can do that.''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>There was agony in his (<font color='blue'><b>Edward</b></font>) beautiful voice
again.
<div class="bookquote">``It's your decision, Edward, either way. I can't help you. I have to get this bleeding stopped here if you're
going to be taking blood from her (<font color='blue'><b>I</b></font>) hand.''
 (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div>I writhed in the grip of the fiery torture, the movement making the pain in my leg flare sickeningly.
<div class="bookquote">``Edward!''  (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div>I screamed. I realized my eyes were closed again. I opened them, desperate to find his (<font color='blue'><b>Edward</b></font>) face.
And I found him (<font color='blue'><b>Edward</b></font>). Finally, I could see his (<font color='blue'><b>Edward</b></font>) perfect face, staring at me, twisted into a mask of indecision and
pain.
<div class="bookquote">``Alice, get me something to brace her (<font color='blue'><b>Alice</b></font>) leg!''  (<font color='red'><b>Carlisle</b></font>)</div>Carlisle was bent over me, working on my head. <div class="bookquote">``Edward,
you must do it now, or it will be too late.''
 (<font color='red'><b>Edward/Edward Cullen/Cullen</b></font>)</div>Edward's face was drawn. I watched his (<font color='blue'><b>Edward</b></font>) eyes as the doubt was suddenly replaced with a blazing
determination. His (<font color='blue'><b>Edward</b></font>) jaw tightened. I felt his (<font color='blue'><b>Edward</b></font>) cool, strong fingers on my burning hand, locking it in place.
Then his (<font color='blue'><b>Edward</b></font>) head bent over it, and his (<font color='blue'><b>Edward</b></font>) cold lips pressed against my skin.
At first the pain was worse. I screamed and thrashed against the cool hands that held me back. I heard
Alice's voice, trying to calm me. Something heavy held my leg to the floor, and Carlisle had my head
locked in the vise of his (<font color='blue'><b>Carlisle</b></font>) stone arms.
Then, slowly, my writhing calmed as my hand grew more and more numb. The fire was dulling, focusing
into an ever-smaller point.
I felt my consciousness slipping as the pain subsided. I was afraid to fall into the black waters again,
afraid I would lose him (<font color='blue'><b>Carlisle</b></font>) in the darkness.
<div class="bookquote">``Edward,''  (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div>I tried to say, but I couldn't hear my voice. They could hear me.
<div class="bookquote">``He (<font color='blue'><b>Edward</b></font>)'s right here, Bella.''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``Stay, Edward, stay with me''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``I will.''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>His (<font color='blue'><b>Carlisle</b></font>) voice was strained, but somehow triumphant.
I sighed contentedly. The fire was gone, the other pains dulled by a sleepiness seeping through my body.
<div class="bookquote">``Is it all out?''  (<font color='red'><b>Carlisle</b></font>)</div>Carlisle asked from somewhere far away.
<div class="bookquote">``Her (<font color='blue'><b>Bella</b></font>) blood tastes clean,''  (<font color='red'><b>Edward/Edward Cullen/Cullen</b></font>)</div>Edward said quietly. <div class="bookquote">``I can taste the morphine.''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``Bella?''  (<font color='red'><b>Carlisle</b></font>)</div>Carlisle called to me.
I tried to answer. <div class="bookquote">``Mmmmm?''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``Is the fire gone?''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``Yes,''  (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div>I sighed. <div class="bookquote">``Thank you, Edward.''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``I love you,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Carlisle</b></font>) answered.
<div class="bookquote">``I know,''  (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div>I breathed, so tired.
I heard my favorite sound in the world: Edward's quiet laugh, weak with relief.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Bella?''  (<font color='red'><b>Carlisle</b></font>)</div>Carlisle asked again.
I frowned; I wanted to sleep. <div class="bookquote">``What?''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``Where is your mother?''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``In Florida,''  (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div>I sighed. <div class="bookquote">``He (<font color='blue'><b>Edward</b></font>) tricked me, Edward. He (<font color='blue'><b>Edward</b></font>) watched our videos.''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>The outrage in my voice was
pitifully frail.
But that reminded me.
<div class="bookquote">``Alice.''  (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div>I tried to open my eyes. <div class="bookquote">``Alice, the video  he (<font color='blue'><b>Edward</b></font>) knew you, Alice, he (<font color='blue'><b>Edward</b></font>) knew where you came
from.''  (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div>I meant to speak urgently, but my voice was feeble. <div class="bookquote">``I smell gasoline,''  (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div>I added, surprised through
the haze in my brain.
<div class="bookquote">``It's time to move her (<font color='blue'><b>Alice</b></font>),''  (<font color='red'><b>Carlisle</b></font>)</div>Carlisle said.
<div class="bookquote">``No, I want to sleep,''  (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div>I complained.
<div class="bookquote">``You can sleep, sweetheart, I'll carry you,''  (<font color='red'><b>Edward/Edward Cullen/Cullen</b></font>)</div>Edward soothed me.
And I was in his (<font color='blue'><b>Edward</b></font>) arms, cradled against his (<font color='blue'><b>Edward</b></font>) chest  floating, all the pain gone.
<div class="bookquote">``Sleep now, Bella''  (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div>were the last words I heard.

<p/>24. AN IMPASSE

<p/>My eyes opened to a bright, white light. I was in an unfamiliar room, a white room. The wall beside me
was covered in long vertical blinds; over my head, the glaring lights blinded me. I was propped up on a
hard, uneven bed  a bed with rails. The pillows were flat and lumpy. There was an annoying beeping
sound somewhere close by. I hoped that meant I was still alive. Death shouldn't be this uncomfortable.
My hands were all twisted up with clear tubes, and something was taped across my face, under my nose.
I lifted my hand to rip it off.
<div class="bookquote">``No, you don't.''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>And cool fingers caught my hand.
<div class="bookquote">``Edward?''  (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div>I turned my head slightly, and his (<font color='blue'><b>My</b></font>) exquisite face was just inches from mine, his (<font color='blue'><b>My</b></font>) chin resting on
the edge of my pillow. I realized again that I was alive, this time with gratitude and elation. <div class="bookquote">``Oh, Edward,
I'm so sorry!''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``Shhhh,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>My</b></font>) shushed me. <div class="bookquote">``Everything's all right now.''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``What happened?''  (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div>I couldn't remember clearly, and my mind rebelled against me as I tried to recall.
<div class="bookquote">``I was almost too late. I could have been too late,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>My</b></font>) whispered, his (<font color='blue'><b>My</b></font>) voice tormented.
<div class="bookquote">``I was so stupid, Edward. I thought he (<font color='blue'><b>Edward</b></font>) had my mom.''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``He (<font color='blue'><b>Edward</b></font>) tricked us all.''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``I need to call Charlie and my mom,''  (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div>I realized through the haze.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Alice called them. Rene is here  well, here in the hospital. She (<font color='blue'><b>Alice</b></font>)'s getting something to eat right now.''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``She (<font color='blue'><b>Alice</b></font>)'s here?''  (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div>I tried to sit up, but the spinning in my head accelerated, and his (<font color='blue'><b>My</b></font>) hand pushed me gently
down onto the pillows.
<div class="bookquote">``She (<font color='blue'><b>Alice</b></font>)'ll be back soon,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>My</b></font>) promised. <div class="bookquote">``And you need to stay still.''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``But what did you tell her (<font color='blue'><b>Alice</b></font>)?''  (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div>I panicked. I had no interest in being soothed. My mom was here and I was
recovering from a vampire attack. <div class="bookquote">``Why did you tell her (<font color='blue'><b>Alice</b></font>) I'm here?''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``You fell down two flights of stairs and through a window.''  (<font color='red'><b>He</b></font>)</div>He (<font color='blue'><b>vampire</b></font>) paused. <div class="bookquote">``You have to admit, it could
happen.''
 (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div>I sighed, and it hurt. I stared down at my body under the sheet, the huge lump that was my leg.
<div class="bookquote">``How bad am I?''  (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div>I asked.
<div class="bookquote">``You have a broken leg, four broken ribs, some cracks in your skull, bruises covering every inch of your
skin, and you've lost a lot of blood. They gave you a few transfusions. I didn't like it  it made you smell
all wrong for a while.''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``That must have been a nice change for you.''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``No, I like how you smell.''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``How did you do it?''  (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div>I asked quietly. He (<font color='blue'><b>vampire</b></font>) knew what I meant at once.
<div class="bookquote">``I'm not sure.''  (<font color='red'><b>He</b></font>)</div>He (<font color='blue'><b>vampire</b></font>) looked away from my wondering eyes, lifting my gauze-wrapped hand from the bed
and holding it gently in his (<font color='blue'><b>vampire</b></font>), careful not to disrupt the wire connecting me to one of the monitors.
I waited patiently for the rest.
He (<font color='blue'><b>vampire</b></font>) sighed without returning my gaze. <div class="bookquote">``It was impossible to stop,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>vampire</b></font>) whispered. <div class="bookquote">``Impossible. But I
did.''  (<font color='red'><b>He</b></font>)</div>He (<font color='blue'><b>vampire</b></font>) looked up finally, with half a smile. <div class="bookquote">``I must love you.''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``Don't I taste as good as I smell?''  (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div>I smiled in response. That hurt my face.
<div class="bookquote">``Even better  better than I'd imagined.''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``I'm sorry,''  (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div>I apologized.
He (<font color='blue'><b>vampire</b></font>) raised his (<font color='blue'><b>vampire</b></font>) eyes to the ceiling. <div class="bookquote">``Of all the things to apologize for.''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``What should I apologize for?''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``For very nearly taking yourself away from me forever.''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``I'm sorry,''  (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div>I apologized again.
<div class="bookquote">``I know why you did it.''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>His (<font color='blue'><b>vampire</b></font>) voice was comforting. <div class="bookquote">``It was still irrational, of course. You should have
waited for me, you should have told me.''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``You wouldn't have let me go.''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``No,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>vampire</b></font>) agreed in a grim tone, <div class="bookquote">``I wouldn't.''

 (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div><p/>Some very unpleasant memories were beginning to come back to me. I shuddered, and then winced.
He (<font color='blue'><b>vampire</b></font>) was instantly anxious. <div class="bookquote">``Bella, what's wrong?''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``What happened to James?''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``After I pulled him (<font color='blue'><b>James</b></font>) off you, Emmett and Jasper took care of him (<font color='blue'><b>Emmett</b></font>).''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>There was a fierce note of regret in his (<font color='blue'><b>vampire</b></font>)
voice.
This confused me. <div class="bookquote">``I didn't see Emmett and Jasper there.''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``They had to leave the room there was a lot of blood.''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``But you stayed.''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``Yes, I stayed.''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``And Alice, and Carlisle''  (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div>I said in wonder.
<div class="bookquote">``They love you, too, you know.''
 (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div>A flash of painful images from the last time I'd seen Alice reminded me of something. <div class="bookquote">``Did Alice see the
tape?''  (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div>I asked anxiously.
<div class="bookquote">``Yes.''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>A new sound darkened his (<font color='blue'><b>vampire</b></font>) voice, a tone of sheer hatred.
<div class="bookquote">``She (<font color='blue'><b>Alice</b></font>) was always in the dark, that's why she (<font color='blue'><b>Alice</b></font>) didn't remember.''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``I know. She (<font color='blue'><b>Alice</b></font>) understands now.''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>His (<font color='blue'><b>vampire</b></font>) voice was even, but his (<font color='blue'><b>vampire</b></font>) face was black with fury.
I tried to reach his (<font color='blue'><b>vampire</b></font>) face with my free hand, but something stopped me. I glanced down to see the IV
pulling at my hand.
<div class="bookquote">``Ugh.''  (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div>I winced.
<div class="bookquote">``What is it?''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>vampire</b></font>) asked anxiously  distracted, but not enough. The bleakness did not entirely leave his (<font color='blue'><b>vampire</b></font>)
eyes.
<div class="bookquote">``Needles,''  (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div>I explained, looking away from the one in my hand. I concentrated on a warped ceiling tile
and tried to breathe deeply despite the ache in my ribs.
<div class="bookquote">``Afraid of a needle,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>vampire</b></font>) muttered to himself under his (<font color='blue'><b>vampire</b></font>) breath, shaking his (<font color='blue'><b>vampire</b></font>) head. <div class="bookquote">``Oh, a sadistic vampire,
intent on torturing her (<font color='blue'><b>Alice</b></font>) to death, sure, no problem, she (<font color='blue'><b>Alice</b></font>) runs off to meet him (<font color='blue'><b>vampire</b></font>). An IV, on the other hand''
 (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div>I rolled my eyes. I was pleased to discover that this reaction, at least, was pain-free. I decided to change
the subject.
<div class="bookquote">``Why are you here?''  (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div>I asked.
He (<font color='blue'><b>vampire</b></font>) stared at me, first confusion and then hurt touching his (<font color='blue'><b>vampire</b></font>) eyes. His (<font color='blue'><b>vampire</b></font>) brows pulled together as he (<font color='blue'><b>vampire</b></font>) frowned.
<div class="bookquote">``Do you want me to leave?''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``No!''  (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div>I protested, horrified by the thought. <div class="bookquote">``No, I meant, why does my mother think you're here? I need
to have my story straight before she (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) gets back.''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``Oh,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>vampire</b></font>) said, and his (<font color='blue'><b>vampire</b></font>) forehead smoothed back into marble. ``I came to Phoenix to talk some sense into

<p/>you, to convince you to come back to Forks.'' His (<font color='blue'><b>vampire</b></font>) wide eyes were so earnest and sincere, I almost
believed him (<font color='blue'><b>vampire</b></font>) myself. ``You agreed to see me, and you drove out to the hotel where I was staying with
Carlisle and Alice  of course I was here with parental supervision,'' he (<font color='blue'><b>vampire</b></font>) inserted virtuously, ``but you
tripped on the stairs on the way to my room and well, you know the rest. You don't need to remember
any details, though; you have a good excuse to be a little muddled about the finer points.''
I thought about it for a moment. ``There are a few flaws with that story. Like no broken windows.''
``Not really,'' he (<font color='blue'><b>vampire</b></font>) said. ``Alice had a little bit too much fun fabricating evidence. It's all been taken care of
very convincingly  you could probably sue the hotel if you wanted to. You have nothing to worry
about,'' he (<font color='blue'><b>vampire</b></font>) promised, stroking my cheek with the lightest of touches. ``Your only job now is to heal.''
I wasn't so lost to the soreness or the fog of medication that I didn't respond to his (<font color='blue'><b>vampire</b></font>) touch. The beeping of
the monitor jumped around erratically  now he (<font color='blue'><b>vampire</b></font>) wasn't the only one who could hear my heart
misbehave.
``That's going to be embarrassing,'' I muttered to myself.
He (<font color='blue'><b>vampire</b></font>) chuckled, and a speculative look came into his (<font color='blue'><b>vampire</b></font>) eye. ``Hmm, I wonder''
He (<font color='blue'><b>vampire</b></font>) leaned in slowly; the beeping noise accelerated wildly before his (<font color='blue'><b>vampire</b></font>) lips even touched me. But when they
did, though with the most gentle of pressure, the beeping stopped altogether.
He (<font color='blue'><b>vampire</b></font>) pulled back abruptly, his (<font color='blue'><b>vampire</b></font>) anxious expression turning to relief as the monitor reported the restarting of
my heart.
``It seems that I'm going to have to be even more careful with you than usual.'' He (<font color='blue'><b>vampire</b></font>) frowned.
``I was not finished kissing you,'' I complained. ``Don't make me come over there.''
He (<font color='blue'><b>vampire</b></font>) grinned, and bent to press his (<font color='blue'><b>vampire</b></font>) lips lightly to mine. The monitor went wild.
But then his (<font color='blue'><b>vampire</b></font>) lips were taut. He (<font color='blue'><b>vampire</b></font>) pulled away.
``I think I hear your mother,'' he (<font color='blue'><b>vampire</b></font>) said, grinning again.
``Don't leave me,'' I cried, an irrational surge of panic flooding through me. I couldn't let him (<font color='blue'><b>vampire</b></font>) go  he (<font color='blue'><b>vampire</b></font>)
might disappear from me again.
He (<font color='blue'><b>vampire</b></font>) read the terror in my eyes for a short second. ``I won't,'' he (<font color='blue'><b>vampire</b></font>) promised solemnly, and then he (<font color='blue'><b>vampire</b></font>) smiled.
``I'll take a nap.''
He (<font color='blue'><b>vampire</b></font>) moved from the hard plastic chair by my side to the turquoise faux-leather recliner at the foot of my
bed, leaning it all the way back, and closing his (<font color='blue'><b>vampire</b></font>) eyes. He (<font color='blue'><b>vampire</b></font>) was perfectly still.
``Don't forget to breathe,'' I whispered sarcastically. He (<font color='blue'><b>vampire</b></font>) took a deep breath, his (<font color='blue'><b>vampire</b></font>) eyes still closed.
I could hear my mother now. She (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) was talking to someone, maybe a nurse, and she (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) sounded tired and
upset. I wanted to jump out of the bed and run to her (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>), to calm her (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>), promise that everything was fine. But
I wasn't in any sort of shape for jumping, so I waited impatiently.
The door opened a crack, and she (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) peeked through.
<div class="bookquote">``Mom!''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>I whispered, my voice full of love and relief.

<p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) took in Edward's still form on the recliner, and tiptoed to my bedside.
<div class="bookquote">``He (<font color='blue'><b>me</b></font>) never leaves, does he (<font color='blue'><b>me</b></font>)?''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) mumbled to herself.
<div class="bookquote">``Mom, I'm so glad to see you!''
 (<font color='red'><b>She</b></font>)</div>She (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) bent down to hug me gently, and I felt warm tears falling on my cheeks.
<div class="bookquote">``Bella, I was so upset!''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``I'm sorry, Mom. But everything's fine now, it's okay,''  (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div>I comforted her (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>).
<div class="bookquote">``I'm just glad to finally see your eyes open.''  (<font color='red'><b>She</b></font>)</div>She (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) sat on the edge of my bed.
I suddenly realized I didn't have any idea when it was. <div class="bookquote">``How long have they been closed?''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``It's Friday, hon, you've been out for a while.''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``Friday?''  (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div>I was shocked. I tried to remember what day it had been when but I didn't want to think
about that.
<div class="bookquote">``They had to keep you sedated for a while, honey  you've got a lot of injuries.''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``I know.''  (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div>I could feel them.
<div class="bookquote">``You're lucky Dr. Cullen was there. He (<font color='blue'><b>Cullen</b></font>)'s such a nice man very young, though. And he (<font color='blue'><b>Cullen</b></font>) looks more like
a model than a doctor''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``You met Carlisle?''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``And Edward's sister Alice. She (<font color='blue'><b>Alice</b></font>)'s a lovely girl.''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``She (<font color='blue'><b>Alice</b></font>) is,''  (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div>I agreed wholeheartedly.
She (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) glanced over her (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) shoulder at Edward, lying with his (<font color='blue'><b>Edward</b></font>) eyes closed in the chair. <div class="bookquote">``You didn't tell me you
had such good friends in Forks.''
 (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div>I cringed, and then moaned.
<div class="bookquote">``What hurts?''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) demanded anxiously, turning back to me. Edward's eyes flashed to my face.
<div class="bookquote">``It's fine,''  (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div>I assured them. <div class="bookquote">``I just have to remember not to move.''  (<font color='red'><b>He</b></font>)</div>He (<font color='blue'><b>Edward</b></font>) lapsed back into his (<font color='blue'><b>Edward</b></font>) phony slumber.
I took advantage of my mother's momentary distraction to keep the subject from returning to my
less-than-candid behavior. <div class="bookquote">``Where's Phil?''  (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div>I asked quickly.
<div class="bookquote">``Florida  oh, Bella! You'll never guess! Just when we were about to leave, the best news!''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``Phil got signed?''  (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div>I guessed.
<div class="bookquote">``Yes! How did you guess! The Suns, can you believe it?''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``That's great, Mom,''  (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div>I said as enthusiastically as I could manage, though I had little idea what that meant.
<div class="bookquote">``And you'll like Jacksonville so much,''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) gushed while I stared at her (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) vacantly. ``I was a little bit worried
when Phil started talking about Akron, what with the snow and everything, because you know how I hate

<p/>the cold, but now Jacksonville! It's always sunny, and the humidity really isn't that bad. We found the
cutest house, yellow, with white trim, and a porch just like in an old movie, and this huge oak tree, and
it's just a few minutes from the ocean, and you'll have your own bathroom ''
``Wait, Mom!'' I interrupted. Edward still had his (<font color='blue'><b>Edward</b></font>) eyes closed, but he (<font color='blue'><b>Edward</b></font>) looked too tense to pass as asleep.
``What are you talking about? I'm not going to Florida. I live in Forks.''
``But you don't have to anymore, silly,'' she (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) laughed. ``Phil will be able to be around so much more now
we've talked about it a lot, and what I'm going to do is trade off on the away games, half the time with
you, half the time with him (<font color='blue'><b>Phil</b></font>).''
``Mom.'' I hesitated, wondering how best to be diplomatic about this. ``I want to live in Forks. I'm already
settled in at school, and I have a couple of girlfriends''  she (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) glanced toward Edward again when I
reminded her (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) of friends, so I tried another direction  ``and Charlie needs me. He (<font color='blue'><b>Charlie</b></font>)'s just all alone up
there, and he (<font color='blue'><b>Charlie</b></font>) can't cook at all.''
``You want to stay in Forks?'' she (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) asked, bewildered. The idea was inconceivable to her (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>). And then her (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>)
eyes flickered back toward Edward. ``Why?''
``I told you  school, Charlie  ouch!'' I'd shrugged. Not a good idea.
Her (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) hands fluttered helplessly over me, trying to find a safe place to pat. She (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) made do with my forehead;
it was unbandaged.
``Bella, honey, you hate Forks,'' she (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) reminded me.
``It's not so bad.''
She (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) frowned and looked back and forth between Edward and me, this time very deliberately.
``Is it this boy?'' she (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) whispered.
I opened my mouth to lie, but her (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) eyes were scrutinizing my face, and I knew she (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) would see through that.
``He (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>)'s part of it,'' I admitted. No need to confess how big a part. ``So, have you had a chance to talk with
Edward?'' I asked.
``Yes.'' She (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) hesitated, looking at his (<font color='blue'><b>Edward</b></font>) perfectly still form. ``And I want to talk to you about that.''
Uh-oh. ``What about?'' I asked.
``I think that boy is in love with you,'' she (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) accused, keeping her (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) voice low.
``I think so, too,'' I confided.
``And how do you feel about him (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>)?'' She (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) only poorly concealed the raging curiosity in her (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) voice.
I sighed, looking away. As much as I loved my mom, this was not a conversation I wanted to have with
her (<font color='blue'><b>mom</b></font>). ``I'm pretty crazy about him (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>).'' There  that sounded like something a teenager with her (<font color='blue'><b>mom</b></font>) first
boyfriend might say.
<div class="bookquote">``Well, he (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>) seems very nice, and, my goodness, he (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>)'s incredibly good-looking, but you're so young,
Bella''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>Her (<font color='blue'><b>mom</b></font>) voice was unsure; as far as I could remember, this was the first time since I was eight that
she (<font color='blue'><b>mom</b></font>)'d come close to trying to sound like a parental authority. I recognized the reasonable-but-firm tone of
voice from talks I'd had with her (<font color='blue'><b>mom</b></font>) about men.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``I know that, Mom. Don't worry about it. It's just a crush,''  (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div>I soothed her (<font color='blue'><b>mom</b></font>).
<div class="bookquote">``That's right,''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>mom</b></font>) agreed, easily pleased.
Then she (<font color='blue'><b>mom</b></font>) sighed and glanced guiltily over her (<font color='blue'><b>mom</b></font>) shoulder at the big, round clock on the wall.
<div class="bookquote">``Do you need to go?''
 (<font color='red'><b>She</b></font>)</div>She (<font color='blue'><b>mom</b></font>) bit her (<font color='blue'><b>mom</b></font>) lip. <div class="bookquote">``Phil's supposed to call in a little while I didn't know you were going to wake up''
 (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``No problem, Mom.''  (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div>I tried to tone down the relief so she (<font color='blue'><b>mom</b></font>) wouldn't get her (<font color='blue'><b>mom</b></font>) feelings hurt. <div class="bookquote">``I won't be
alone.''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``I'll be back soon. I've been sleeping here, you know,''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>mom</b></font>) announced, proud of herself.
<div class="bookquote">``Oh, Mom, you don't have to do that! You can sleep at home  I'll never notice.''  (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div>The swirl of
painkillers in my brain was making it hard to concentrate even now, though, apparently, I'd been sleeping
for days.
<div class="bookquote">``I was too nervous,''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>mom</b></font>) admitted sheepishly. <div class="bookquote">``There's been some crime in the neighborhood, and I don't
like being there alone.''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``Crime?''  (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div>I asked in alarm.
<div class="bookquote">``Someone broke into that dance studio around the corner from the house and burned it to the ground 
there's nothing left at all! And they left a stolen car right out front. Do you remember when you used to
dance there, honey?''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``I remember.''  (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div>I shivered, and winced.
<div class="bookquote">``I can stay, baby, if you need me.''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``No, Mom, I'll be fine. Edward will be with me.''
 (<font color='red'><b>She</b></font>)</div>She (<font color='blue'><b>mom</b></font>) looked like that might be why she (<font color='blue'><b>mom</b></font>) wanted to stay. <div class="bookquote">``I'll be back tonight.''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>It sounded as much like a
warning as it sounded like a promise, and she (<font color='blue'><b>mom</b></font>) glanced at Edward again as she (<font color='blue'><b>mom</b></font>) said it.
<div class="bookquote">``I love you, Mom.''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``I love you, too, Bella. Try to be more careful when you walk, honey, I don't want to lose you.''
 (<font color='red'><b>Edward/Edward Cullen/Cullen</b></font>)</div>Edward's eyes stayed closed, but a wide grin flashed across his (<font color='blue'><b>Edward</b></font>) face.
A nurse came bustling in then to check all my tubes and wires. My mother kissed my forehead, patted
my gauze-wrapped hand, and left.
The nurse was checking the paper readout on my heart monitor.
<div class="bookquote">``Are you feeling anxious, honey? Your heart rate got a little high there.''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``I'm fine,''  (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div>I assured her (<font color='blue'><b>nurse</b></font>).
<div class="bookquote">``I'll tell your RN that you're awake. She (<font color='blue'><b>RN</b></font>)'ll be in to see you in a minute.''
 (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>As soon as she (<font color='blue'><b>nurse</b></font>) closed the door, Edward was at my side.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``You stole a car?''  (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div>I raised my eyebrows.
He (<font color='blue'><b>Edward</b></font>) smiled, unrepentant. <div class="bookquote">``It was a good car, very fast.''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``How was your nap?''  (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div>I asked.
<div class="bookquote">``Interesting.''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>His (<font color='blue'><b>Edward</b></font>) eyes narrowed.
<div class="bookquote">``What?''
 (<font color='red'><b>He</b></font>)</div>He (<font color='blue'><b>Edward</b></font>) looked down while he (<font color='blue'><b>Edward</b></font>) answered. <div class="bookquote">``I'm surprised. I thought Florida and your mother well, I
thought that's what you would want.''
 (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div>I stared at him (<font color='blue'><b>Edward</b></font>) uncomprehendingly. <div class="bookquote">``But you'd be stuck inside all day in Florida. You'd only be able to
come out at night, just like a real vampire.''
 (<font color='red'><b>He</b></font>)</div>He (<font color='blue'><b>Edward</b></font>) almost smiled, but not quite. And then his (<font color='blue'><b>Edward</b></font>) face was grave. <div class="bookquote">``I would stay in Forks, Bella. Or
somewhere like it,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Edward</b></font>) explained. <div class="bookquote">``Someplace where I couldn't hurt you anymore.''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>It didn't sink in at first. I continued to stare at him (<font color='blue'><b>Edward</b></font>) blankly as the words one by one clicked into place in
my head like a ghastly puzzle. I was barely conscious of the sound of my heart accelerating, though, as
my breathing became hyperventilation, I was aware of the sharp aching in my protesting ribs.
He (<font color='blue'><b>Edward</b></font>) didn't say anything; he (<font color='blue'><b>Edward</b></font>) watched my face warily as the pain that had nothing to do with broken bones,
pain that was infinitely worse, threatened to crush me.
And then another nurse walked purposefully into the room. Edward sat still as stone as she (<font color='blue'><b>nurse</b></font>) took in my
expression with a practiced eye before turning to the monitors.
<div class="bookquote">``Time for more pain meds, sweetheart?''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>nurse</b></font>) asked kindly, tapping the IV feed.
<div class="bookquote">``No, no,''  (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div>I mumbled, trying to keep the agony out of my voice. <div class="bookquote">``I don't need anything.''  (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div>I couldn't afford
to close my eyes now.
<div class="bookquote">``No need to be brave, honey. It's better if you don't get too stressed out; you need to rest.''  (<font color='red'><b>She</b></font>)</div>She (<font color='blue'><b>nurse</b></font>) waited,
but I just shook my head.
<div class="bookquote">``Okay,''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>nurse</b></font>) sighed. <div class="bookquote">``Hit the call button when you're ready.''
 (<font color='red'><b>She</b></font>)</div>She (<font color='blue'><b>nurse</b></font>) gave Edward a stern look, and threw one more anxious glance at the machinery, before leaving.
His (<font color='blue'><b>Edward</b></font>) cool hands were on my face; I stared at him (<font color='blue'><b>Edward</b></font>) with wild eyes.
<div class="bookquote">``Shhh, Bella, calm down.''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``Don't leave me,''  (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div>I begged in a broken voice.
<div class="bookquote">``I won't,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Edward</b></font>) promised. <div class="bookquote">``Now relax before I call the nurse back to sedate you.''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>But my heart couldn't slow.
<div class="bookquote">``Bella.''  (<font color='red'><b>He</b></font>)</div>He (<font color='blue'><b>Edward</b></font>) stroked my face anxiously. <div class="bookquote">``I'm not going anywhere. I'll be right here as long as you need
me.''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``Do you swear you won't leave me?''  (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div>I whispered. I tried to control the gasping, at least. My ribs were
throbbing.

<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Edward</b></font>) put his (<font color='blue'><b>Edward</b></font>) hands on either side of my face and brought his (<font color='blue'><b>Edward</b></font>) face close to mine. His (<font color='blue'><b>Edward</b></font>) eyes were wide and
serious. <div class="bookquote">``I swear.''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>The smell of his (<font color='blue'><b>Edward</b></font>) breath was soothing. It seemed to ease the ache of my breathing. He (<font color='blue'><b>Edward</b></font>) continued to hold
my gaze while my body slowly relaxed and the beeping returned to a normal pace. His (<font color='blue'><b>Edward</b></font>) eyes were dark,
closer to black than gold today.
<div class="bookquote">``Better?''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Edward</b></font>) asked.
<div class="bookquote">``Yes,''  (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div>I said cautiously.
He (<font color='blue'><b>Edward</b></font>) shook his (<font color='blue'><b>Edward</b></font>) head and muttered something unintelligible. I thought I picked out the word <div class="bookquote">``overreaction.''
 (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``Why did you say that?''  (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div>I whispered, trying to keep my voice from shaking. <div class="bookquote">``Are you tired of having to
save me all the time? Do you want me to go away?''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``No, I don't want to be without you, Bella, of course not. Be rational. And I have no problem with saving
you, either  if it weren't for the fact that I was the one putting you in danger that I'm the reason that
you're here.''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``Yes, you are the reason.''  (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div>I frowned. <div class="bookquote">``The reason I'm here  alive.''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``Barely.''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>His (<font color='blue'><b>Edward</b></font>) voice was just a whisper. <div class="bookquote">``Covered in gauze and plaster and hardly able to move.''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``I wasn't referring to my most recent near-death experience,''  (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div>I said, growing irritated. <div class="bookquote">``I was thinking of
the others  you can take your pick. If it weren't for you, I would be rotting away in the Forks
cemetery.''
 (<font color='red'><b>He</b></font>)</div>He (<font color='blue'><b>Edward</b></font>) winced at my words, but the haunted look didn't leave his (<font color='blue'><b>Edward</b></font>) eyes.
<div class="bookquote">``That's not the worst part, though,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Edward</b></font>) continued to whisper. He (<font color='blue'><b>Edward</b></font>) acted as if I hadn't spoken. <div class="bookquote">``Not seeing
you there on the floor crumpled and broken.''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>His (<font color='blue'><b>Edward</b></font>) voice was choked. <div class="bookquote">``Not thinking I was too late. Not
even hearing you scream in pain  all those unbearable memories that I'll carry with me for the rest of
eternity. No, the very worst was feeling knowing that I couldn't stop. Believing that I was going to kill
you myself.''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``But you didn't.''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``I could have. So easily.''
 (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div>I knew I needed to stay calm but he (<font color='blue'><b>Edward</b></font>) was trying to talk himself into leaving me, and the panic fluttered
in my lungs, trying to get out.
<div class="bookquote">``Promise me,''  (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div>I whispered.
<div class="bookquote">``What?''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``You know what.''  (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div>I was starting to get angry now. He (<font color='blue'><b>Edward</b></font>) was so stubbornly determined to dwell on the
negative.
He (<font color='blue'><b>Edward</b></font>) heard the change in my tone. His (<font color='blue'><b>Edward</b></font>) eyes tightened. <div class="bookquote">``I don't seem to be strong enough to stay away from
you, so I suppose that you'll get your way whether it kills you or not,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Edward</b></font>) added roughly.
<div class="bookquote">``Good.''  (<font color='red'><b>He</b></font>)</div>He (<font color='blue'><b>Edward</b></font>) hadn't promised, though  a fact that I had not missed. The panic was only barely
contained; I had no strength left to control the anger. ``You told me how you stopped now I want to

<p/>know why,'' I demanded.
``Why?'' he (<font color='blue'><b>Edward</b></font>) repeated warily.
``Why you did it. Why didn't you just let the venom spread? By now I would be just like you.''
Edward's eyes seemed to turn flat black, and I remembered that this was something he (<font color='blue'><b>Edward</b></font>)'d never intended
me to know. Alice must have been preoccupied by the things she (<font color='blue'><b>Alice</b></font>)'d learned about herself or she (<font color='blue'><b>Alice</b></font>)'d been
very careful with her (<font color='blue'><b>Alice</b></font>) thoughts around him (<font color='blue'><b>Edward</b></font>)  clearly, he (<font color='blue'><b>Edward</b></font>)'d had no idea that she (<font color='blue'><b>Alice</b></font>)'d filled me in on the
mechanics of vampire conversions. He (<font color='blue'><b>vampire</b></font>) was surprised, and infuriated. His (<font color='blue'><b>vampire</b></font>) nostrils flared, his (<font color='blue'><b>vampire</b></font>) mouth looked
as if it was chiseled from stone.
He (<font color='blue'><b>vampire</b></font>) wasn't going to answer, that much was clear.
``I'll be the first to admit that I have no experience with relationships,'' I said. ``But it just seems logical a
man and woman have to be somewhat equal as in, one of them can't always be swooping in and
saving the other one. They have to save each other equally.''
He (<font color='blue'><b>vampire</b></font>) folded his (<font color='blue'><b>vampire</b></font>) arms on the side of my bed and rested his (<font color='blue'><b>vampire</b></font>) chin on his (<font color='blue'><b>vampire</b></font>) arms. His (<font color='blue'><b>vampire</b></font>) expression was smooth,
the anger reined in. Evidently he (<font color='blue'><b>vampire</b></font>)'d decided he (<font color='blue'><b>vampire</b></font>) wasn't angry with me. I hoped I'd get a chance to warn
Alice before he (<font color='blue'><b>vampire</b></font>) caught up with her (<font color='blue'><b>Alice</b></font>).
``You have saved me,'' he (<font color='blue'><b>vampire</b></font>) said quietly.
``I can't always be Lois Lane,'' I insisted. ``I want to be Superman, too.''
``You don't know what you're asking.'' His (<font color='blue'><b>vampire</b></font>) voice was soft; he (<font color='blue'><b>vampire</b></font>) stared intently at the edge of the pillowcase.
``I think I do.''
``Bella, you don't know. I've had almost ninety years to think about this, and I'm still not sure.''
``Do you wish that Carlisle hadn't saved you?''
``No, I don't wish that.'' He (<font color='blue'><b>vampire</b></font>) paused before continuing. ``But my life was over. I wasn't giving anything up.''
``You are my life. You're the only thing it would hurt me to lose.'' I was getting better at this. It was easy
to admit how much I needed him (<font color='blue'><b>vampire</b></font>).
He (<font color='blue'><b>vampire</b></font>) was very calm, though. Decided.
``I can't do it, Bella. I won't do that to you.''
``Why not?'' My throat rasped and the words weren't as loud as I'd meant them to be. ``Don't tell me it's
too hard! After today, or I guess it was a few days ago anyway, after that, it should be nothing.''
He (<font color='blue'><b>vampire</b></font>) glared at me.
``And the pain?'' he (<font color='blue'><b>vampire</b></font>) asked.
I blanched. I couldn't help it. But I tried to keep my expression from showing how clearly I remembered
the feeling the fire in my veins.
``That's my problem,'' I said. ``I can handle it.''
<div class="bookquote">``It's possible to take bravery to the point where it becomes insanity.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``It's not an issue. Three days. Big deal.''
 (<font color='red'><b>Edward/Edward Cullen/Cullen</b></font>)</div>Edward grimaced again as my words reminded him (<font color='blue'><b>Edward</b></font>) that I was more informed than he (<font color='blue'><b>Edward</b></font>) had ever intended
me to be. I watched him (<font color='blue'><b>Edward</b></font>) repress the anger, watched as his (<font color='blue'><b>Edward</b></font>) eyes grew speculative.
<div class="bookquote">``Charlie?''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Edward</b></font>) asked curtly. <div class="bookquote">``Rene?''
 (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div>Minutes passed in silence as I struggled to answer his (<font color='blue'><b>Edward</b></font>) question. I opened my mouth, but no sound came
out. I closed it again. He (<font color='blue'><b>Edward</b></font>) waited, and his (<font color='blue'><b>Edward</b></font>) expression became triumphant because he (<font color='blue'><b>Edward</b></font>) knew I had no true
answer.
<div class="bookquote">``Look, that's not an issue either,''  (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div>I finally muttered; my voice was as unconvincing as it always was when
I lied. <div class="bookquote">``Rene has always made the choices that work for her (<font color='blue'><b>It</b></font>)  she (<font color='blue'><b>It</b></font>)'d want me to do the same. And
Charlie's resilient, he (<font color='blue'><b>Charlie</b></font>)'s used to being on his (<font color='blue'><b>Charlie</b></font>) own. I can't take care of them forever. I have my own life to
live.''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``Exactly,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Edward</b></font>) snapped. <div class="bookquote">``And I won't end it for you.''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``If you're waiting for me to be on my deathbed, I've got news for you! I was just there!''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``You're going to recover,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Edward</b></font>) reminded me.
I took a deep breath to calm myself, ignoring the spasm of pain it triggered. I stared at him (<font color='blue'><b>Edward</b></font>), and he (<font color='blue'><b>Edward</b></font>) stared
back. There was no compromise in his (<font color='blue'><b>Edward</b></font>) face.
<div class="bookquote">``No,''  (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div>I said slowly. <div class="bookquote">``I'm not.''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>His (<font color='blue'><b>Edward</b></font>) forehead creased. <div class="bookquote">``Of course you are. You may have a scar or two''
 (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``You're wrong,''  (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div>I insisted. <div class="bookquote">``I'm going to die.''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``Really, Bella.''  (<font color='red'><b>He</b></font>)</div>He (<font color='blue'><b>Edward</b></font>) was anxious now. <div class="bookquote">``You'll be out of here in a few days. Two week at most.''
 (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div>I glared at him (<font color='blue'><b>Edward</b></font>). <div class="bookquote">``I may not die now but I'm going to die sometime. Every minute of the day, I get
closer. And I'm going to get old.''
 (<font color='red'><b>He</b></font>)</div>He (<font color='blue'><b>Edward</b></font>) frowned as what I was saying sunk in, pressing his (<font color='blue'><b>Edward</b></font>) long fingers to his (<font color='blue'><b>Edward</b></font>) temples and closing his (<font color='blue'><b>Edward</b></font>) eyes.
<div class="bookquote">``That's how it's supposed to happen. How it should happen. How it would have happened if I didn't exist
 and I shouldn't exist.''
 (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div>I snorted. He (<font color='blue'><b>Edward</b></font>) opened his (<font color='blue'><b>Edward</b></font>) eyes in surprise. ``That's stupid. That's like going to someone who's just won the
lottery, taking their money, and saying, ``Look, let's just go back to how things should be. It's better that
way.<div class="bookquote">'' And I'm not buying it.''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``I'm hardly a lottery prize,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Edward</b></font>) growled.
<div class="bookquote">``That's right. You're much better.''
 (<font color='red'><b>He</b></font>)</div>He (<font color='blue'><b>Edward</b></font>) rolled his (<font color='blue'><b>Edward</b></font>) eyes and set his (<font color='blue'><b>Edward</b></font>) lips. <div class="bookquote">``Bella, we're not having this discussion anymore. I refuse to damn you
to an eternity of night and that's the end of it.''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``If you think that's the end, then you don't know me very well,''  (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div>I warned him (<font color='blue'><b>Edward</b></font>). <div class="bookquote">``You're not the only
vampire I know.''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>His (<font color='blue'><b>Edward</b></font>) eyes went black again. <div class="bookquote">``Alice wouldn't dare.''

 (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div><p/>And for a moment he (<font color='blue'><b>Edward</b></font>) looked so frightening that I couldn't help but believe it  I couldn't imagine
someone brave enough to cross him (<font color='blue'><b>Edward</b></font>).
<div class="bookquote">``Alice already saw it, didn't she (<font color='blue'><b>Alice</b></font>)?''  (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div>I guessed. <div class="bookquote">``That's why the things she (<font color='blue'><b>Alice</b></font>) says upset you. She (<font color='blue'><b>Alice</b></font>) knows I'm
going to be like you someday.''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``She (<font color='blue'><b>Alice</b></font>)'s wrong. She (<font color='blue'><b>Alice</b></font>) also saw you dead, but that didn't happen, either.''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``You'll never catch me betting against Alice.''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>We stared at each other for a very long time. It was quiet except for the whirring of the machines, the
beeping, the dripping, the ticking of the big clock on the wall. Finally, his (<font color='blue'><b>Edward</b></font>) expression softened.
<div class="bookquote">``So where does that leave us?''  (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div>I wondered.
He (<font color='blue'><b>Edward</b></font>) chuckled humorlessly. <div class="bookquote">``I believe it's called an impasse.''
 (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div>I sighed. <div class="bookquote">``Ouch,''  (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div>I muttered.
<div class="bookquote">``How are you feeling?''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Edward</b></font>) asked, eyeing the button for the nurse.
<div class="bookquote">``I'm fine,''  (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div>I lied.
<div class="bookquote">``I don't believe you,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Edward</b></font>) said gently.
<div class="bookquote">``I'm not going back to sleep.''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``You need rest. All this arguing isn't good for you.''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``So give in,''  (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div>I hinted.
<div class="bookquote">``Nice try.''  (<font color='red'><b>He</b></font>)</div>He (<font color='blue'><b>Edward</b></font>) reached for the button.
<div class="bookquote">``No!''
 (<font color='red'><b>He</b></font>)</div>He (<font color='blue'><b>Edward</b></font>) ignored me.
<div class="bookquote">``Yes?''  (<font color='red'><b>the speaker</b></font>)</div>the speaker on the wall squawked.
<div class="bookquote">``I think we're ready for more pain medication,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Edward</b></font>) said calmly, ignoring my furious expression.
<div class="bookquote">``I'll send in the nurse.''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>The voice sounded very bored.
<div class="bookquote">``I won't take it,''  (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div>I promised.
He (<font color='blue'><b>Edward</b></font>) looked toward the sack of fluids hanging beside my bed. <div class="bookquote">``I don't think they're going to ask you to
swallow anything.''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>My heart rate started to climb. He (<font color='blue'><b>Edward</b></font>) read the fear in my eyes, and sighed in frustration.
<div class="bookquote">``Bella, you're in pain. You need to relax so you can heal. Why are you being so difficult? They're not
going to put any more needles in you now.''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``I'm not afraid of the needles,''  (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div>I mumbled. <div class="bookquote">``I'm afraid to close my eyes.''
 (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>Then he (<font color='blue'><b>Edward</b></font>) smiled his (<font color='blue'><b>Edward</b></font>) crooked smile, and took my face between his (<font color='blue'><b>Edward</b></font>) hands. ``I told you I'm not going

<p/>anywhere. Don't be afraid. As long as it makes you happy, I'll be here.''
I smiled back, ignoring the ache in my cheeks. ``You're talking about forever, you know.''
``Oh, you'll get over it  it's just a crush.''
I shook my head in disbelief it made me dizzy. ``I was shocked when Rene swallowed that one. I
know you know better.''
``That's the beautiful thing about being human,'' he (<font color='blue'><b>Edward</b></font>) told me. ``Things change.''
My eyes narrowed. ``Don't hold your breath.''
He (<font color='blue'><b>Edward</b></font>) was laughing when the nurse came in, brandishing a syringe.
``Excuse me,'' she (<font color='blue'><b>nurse</b></font>) said brusquely to Edward.
He (<font color='blue'><b>Edward</b></font>) got up and crossed to the end of the small room, leaning against the wall. He (<font color='blue'><b>Edward</b></font>) folded his (<font color='blue'><b>Edward</b></font>) arms and
waited. I kept my eyes on him (<font color='blue'><b>Edward</b></font>), still apprehensive. He (<font color='blue'><b>Edward</b></font>) met my gaze calmly.
``Here you go, honey.'' The nurse smiled as she (<font color='blue'><b>nurse</b></font>) injected the medicine into my tube. ``You'll feel better
now.''
``Thanks,'' I mumbled, unenthusiastic. It didn't take long. I could feel the drowsiness trickling through my
bloodstream almost immediately.
``That ought to do it,'' she (<font color='blue'><b>nurse</b></font>) muttered as my eyelids drooped.
She (<font color='blue'><b>nurse</b></font>) must have left the room, because something cold and smooth touched my face.
``Stay.'' The word was slurred.
``I will,'' he (<font color='blue'><b>Edward</b></font>) promised. His (<font color='blue'><b>Edward</b></font>) voice was beautiful, like a lullaby. ``Like I said, as long as it makes you happy
as long as it's what's best for you.<div class="bookquote">''
I tried to shake my head, but it was too heavy. '' (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div>'S not the same thing,'' I mumbled.
He (<font color='blue'><b>Edward</b></font>) laughed. ``Don't worry about that now, Bella. You can argue with me when you wake up.''
I think I smiled. '``Kay.''
I could feel his (<font color='blue'><b>Edward</b></font>) lips at my ear.
``I love you,'' he (<font color='blue'><b>Edward</b></font>) whispered.
``Me, too.''
``I know,'' he (<font color='blue'><b>Edward</b></font>) laughed quietly.
I turned my head slightly searching. He (<font color='blue'><b>Edward</b></font>) knew what I was after. His (<font color='blue'><b>Edward</b></font>) lips touched mine gently.
``Thanks,'' I sighed.
<div class="bookquote">``Anytime.''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>I wasn't really there at all anymore. But I fought against the stupor weakly. There was just one more thing

<p/>I wanted to tell him (<font color='blue'><b>Edward</b></font>).
<div class="bookquote">``Edward?''  (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div>I struggled to pronounce his (<font color='blue'><b>Edward</b></font>) name clearly.
<div class="bookquote">``Yes?''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``I'm betting on Alice,''  (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div>I mumbled.
And then the night closed over me.

<p/>EPILOGUE:AN OCCASION

<p/>Edward helped me into his (<font color='blue'><b>Edward</b></font>) car, being very careful of the wisps of silk and chiffon, the flowers he (<font color='blue'><b>Edward</b></font>)'d just
pinned into my elaborately styled curls, and my bulky walking cast. He (<font color='blue'><b>Edward</b></font>) ignored the angry set of my
mouth.
When he (<font color='blue'><b>Edward</b></font>) had me settled, he (<font color='blue'><b>Edward</b></font>) got in the driver's seat and headed back out the long, narrow drive.
<div class="bookquote">``At what point exactly are you going to tell me what's going on?''  (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div>I asked grumpily. I really hated
surprises. And he (<font color='blue'><b>Edward</b></font>) knew that.
<div class="bookquote">``I'm shocked that you haven't figured it out yet.''  (<font color='red'><b>He</b></font>)</div>He (<font color='blue'><b>Edward</b></font>) threw a mocking smile in my direction, and my
breath caught in my throat. Would I ever get used to his (<font color='blue'><b>Edward</b></font>) perfection?
<div class="bookquote">``I did mention that you looked very nice, didn't I?''  (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div>I verified.
<div class="bookquote">``Yes.''  (<font color='red'><b>He</b></font>)</div>He (<font color='blue'><b>Edward</b></font>) grinned again. I'd never seen him (<font color='blue'><b>Edward</b></font>) dress in black before, and, with the contrast against his (<font color='blue'><b>Edward</b></font>) pale
skin, his (<font color='blue'><b>Edward</b></font>) beauty was absolutely surreal. That much I couldn't deny, even if the fact that he (<font color='blue'><b>Edward</b></font>) was wearing a
tuxedo made me very nervous.
Not quite as nervous as the dress. Or the shoe. Only one shoe, as my other foot was still securely
encased in plaster. But the stiletto heel, held on only by satin ribbons, certainly wasn't going to help me as
I tried to hobble around.
<div class="bookquote">``I'm not coming over anymore if Alice is going to treat me like Guinea Pig Barbie when I do,''  (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div>I griped.
I'd spent the better part of the day in Alice's staggeringly vast bathroom, a helpless victim as she (<font color='blue'><b>Alice</b></font>) played
hairdresser and cosmetician. Whenever I fidgeted or complained, she (<font color='blue'><b>Alice</b></font>) reminded me that she (<font color='blue'><b>Alice</b></font>) didn't have
any memories of being human, and asked me not to ruin her (<font color='blue'><b>Alice</b></font>) vicarious fun. Then she (<font color='blue'><b>Alice</b></font>)'d dressed me in the
most ridiculous dress  deep blue, frilly and off the shoulders, with French tags I couldn't read  a
dress more suitable for a runway than Forks. Nothing good could come of our formal attire, of that I was
sure. Unless but I was afraid to put my suspicions into words, even in my own head.
I was distracted then by the sound of a phone ringing. Edward pulled his (<font color='blue'><b>Edward</b></font>) cell phone from a pocket inside
his (<font color='blue'><b>Edward</b></font>) jacket, looking briefly at the caller ID before answering.
<div class="bookquote">``Hello, Charlie,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Edward</b></font>) said warily.
<div class="bookquote">``Charlie?''  (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div>I frowned.
Charlie had been difficult since my return to Forks. He (<font color='blue'><b>Charlie</b></font>) had compartmentalized my bad experience into
two defined reactions. Toward Carlisle he (<font color='blue'><b>Charlie</b></font>) was almost worshipfully grateful. On the other hand, he (<font color='blue'><b>Charlie</b></font>) was

<p/>stubbornly convinced that Edward was at fault  because, if not for him (<font color='blue'><b>Edward</b></font>), I wouldn't have left home in the
first place. And Edward was far from disagreeing with him (<font color='blue'><b>Edward</b></font>). These days I had rules that hadn't existed
before: curfews visiting hours.
Something Charlie was saying made Edward's eyes widen in disbelief, and then a grin spread across his (<font color='blue'><b>Charlie</b></font>)
face.
<div class="bookquote">``You're kidding!''  (<font color='red'><b>He</b></font>)</div>He (<font color='blue'><b>Charlie</b></font>) laughed.
<div class="bookquote">``What is it?''  (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div>I demanded.
He (<font color='blue'><b>Charlie</b></font>) ignored me. <div class="bookquote">``Why don't you let me talk to him (<font color='blue'><b>Charlie</b></font>)?''  (<font color='red'><b>Edward/Edward Cullen/Cullen</b></font>)</div>Edward suggested with evident pleasure. He (<font color='blue'><b>Edward</b></font>) waited
for a few seconds.
<div class="bookquote">``Hello, Tyler, this is Edward Cullen.''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>His (<font color='blue'><b>Edward</b></font>) voice was very friendly, on the surface. I knew it well enough to
catch the soft edge of menace. What was Tyler doing at my house? The awful truth began to dawn on
me. I looked again at the inappropriate dress Alice had forced me into.
<div class="bookquote">``I'm sorry if there's been some kind of miscommunication, but Bella is unavailable tonight.''  (<font color='red'><b>Edward/Edward Cullen/Cullen</b></font>)</div>Edward's tone
changed, and the threat in his (<font color='blue'><b>Edward</b></font>) voice was suddenly much more evident as he (<font color='blue'><b>Edward</b></font>) continued. <div class="bookquote">``To be perfectly
honest, she (<font color='blue'><b>Bella</b></font>)'ll be unavailable every night, as far as anyone besides myself is concerned. No offense. And
I'm sorry about your evening.''  (<font color='red'><b>He</b></font>)</div>He (<font color='blue'><b>Edward</b></font>) didn't sound sorry at all. And then he (<font color='blue'><b>Edward</b></font>) snapped the phone shut, a huge
smirk on his (<font color='blue'><b>Edward</b></font>) face.
My face and neck flushed crimson with anger. I could feel the rage-induced tears starting to fill my eyes.
He (<font color='blue'><b>Edward</b></font>) looked at me in surprise. <div class="bookquote">``Was that last part a bit too much? I didn't mean to offend you.''
 (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div>I ignored that.
<div class="bookquote">``You're taking me to the prom!''  (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div>I yelled.
It was embarrassingly obvious now. If I'd been paying any attention at all, I'm sure I would have noticed
the date on the posters that decorated the school buildings. But I'd never dreamed he (<font color='blue'><b>Edward</b></font>) was thinking of
subjecting me to this. Didn't he (<font color='blue'><b>Edward</b></font>) know me at all?
He (<font color='blue'><b>Edward</b></font>) wasn't expecting the force of my reaction, that was clear. He (<font color='blue'><b>Edward</b></font>) pressed his (<font color='blue'><b>Edward</b></font>) lips together and his (<font color='blue'><b>Edward</b></font>) eyes
narrowed. <div class="bookquote">``Don't be difficult, Bella.''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>My eyes flashed to the window; we were halfway to the school already.
<div class="bookquote">``Why are you doing this to me?''  (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div>I demanded in horror.
He (<font color='blue'><b>Edward</b></font>) gestured to his (<font color='blue'><b>Edward</b></font>) tuxedo. <div class="bookquote">``Honestly, Bella, what did you think we were doing?''
 (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div>I was mortified. First, because I'd missed the obvious. And also because the vague suspicions 
expectations, really  that I'd been forming all day, as Alice tried to transform me into a beauty queen,
were so far wide of the mark. My half-fearful hopes seemed very silly now.
I'd guessed there was some kind of occasion brewing. But prom! That was the furthest thing from my
mind.
The angry tears rolled over my cheeks. I remembered with dismay that I was very uncharacteristically
wearing mascara. I wiped quickly under my eyes to prevent any smudges. My hand was unblackened
when I pulled it away; maybe Alice had known I would need waterproof makeup.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``This is completely ridiculous. Why are you crying?''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>I</b></font>) demanded in frustration.
<div class="bookquote">``Because I'm mad!''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``Bella.''  (<font color='red'><b>He</b></font>)</div>He (<font color='blue'><b>I</b></font>) turned the full force of his (<font color='blue'><b>I</b></font>) scorching golden eyes on me.
<div class="bookquote">``What?''  (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div>I muttered, distracted.
<div class="bookquote">``Humor me,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>I</b></font>) insisted.
His (<font color='blue'><b>I</b></font>) eyes were melting all my fury. It was impossible to fight with him (<font color='blue'><b>I</b></font>) when he (<font color='blue'><b>I</b></font>) cheated like that. I gave in
with poor grace.
<div class="bookquote">``Fine,''  (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div>I pouted, unable to glare as effectively as I would have liked. <div class="bookquote">``I'll go quietly. But you'll see. I'm
way overdue for more bad luck. I'll probably break my other leg. Look at this shoe! It's a death trap!''  (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div>I
held out my good leg as evidence.
<div class="bookquote">``Hmmm.''  (<font color='red'><b>He</b></font>)</div>He (<font color='blue'><b>I</b></font>) stared at my leg longer than was necessary. <div class="bookquote">``Remind me to thank Alice for that tonight.''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``Alice is going to be there?''  (<font color='red'><b>me</b></font>)</div>That comforted me slightly.
<div class="bookquote">``With Jasper, and Emmett and Rosalie,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>I</b></font>) admitted.
The feeling of comfort disappeared. There had been no progress with Rosalie, though I was on quite
good terms with her (<font color='blue'><b>Rosalie</b></font>) sometimes-husband. Emmett enjoyed having me around  he (<font color='blue'><b>Emmett</b></font>) thought my bizarre
human reactions were hilarious or maybe it was just the fact that I fell down a lot that he (<font color='blue'><b>Emmett</b></font>) found so
funny. Rosalie acted as if I didn't exist. While I shook my head to dispel the direction my thoughts had
taken, I thought of something else.
<div class="bookquote">``Is Charlie in on this?''  (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div>I asked, suddenly suspicious.
<div class="bookquote">``Of course.''  (<font color='red'><b>He</b></font>)</div>He (<font color='blue'><b>Emmett</b></font>) grinned, and then chuckled. <div class="bookquote">``Apparently Tyler wasn't, though.''
 (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div>I gritted my teeth. How Tyler could be so delusional, I couldn't imagine. At school, where Charlie
couldn't interfere, Edward and I were inseparable  except for those rare sunny days.
We were at the school now; Rosalie's red convertible was conspicuous in the parking lot. The clouds
were thin today, a few streaks of sunlight escaping through far away in the west.
He (<font color='blue'><b>Edward</b></font>) got out and walked around the car to open my door. He (<font color='blue'><b>Edward</b></font>) held out his (<font color='blue'><b>Edward</b></font>) hand.
I sat stubbornly in my seat, arms folded, feeling a secret twinge of smugness. The lot was crowded with
people in formal dress: witnesses. He (<font color='blue'><b>Edward</b></font>) couldn't remove me forcibly from the car as he (<font color='blue'><b>Edward</b></font>) might have if we'd
been alone.
He (<font color='blue'><b>Edward</b></font>) sighed. <div class="bookquote">``When someone wants to kill you, you're brave as a lion  and then when someone mentions
dancing''  (<font color='red'><b>He</b></font>)</div>He (<font color='blue'><b>Edward</b></font>) shook his (<font color='blue'><b>Edward</b></font>) head.
I gulped. Dancing.
<div class="bookquote">``Bella, I won't let anything hurt you  not even yourself. I won't let go of you once, I promise.''
 (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div>I thought about that and suddenly felt much better. He (<font color='blue'><b>Edward</b></font>) could see that in my face.
<div class="bookquote">``There, now,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Edward</b></font>) said gently, <div class="bookquote">``it won't be so bad.''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>He (<font color='blue'><b>Edward</b></font>) leaned down and wrapped one arm around my

<p/>waist. I took his (<font color='blue'><b>Edward</b></font>) other hand and let him (<font color='blue'><b>Edward</b></font>) lift me from the car.
He (<font color='blue'><b>Edward</b></font>) kept his (<font color='blue'><b>Edward</b></font>) arm tightly around me, supporting me as I limped toward the school.
In Phoenix, they held proms in hotel ballrooms. This dance was in the gym, of course. It was probably
the only room in town big enough for a dance. When we got inside, I giggled. There were actual balloon
arches and twisted garlands of pastel crepe paper festooning the walls.
<div class="bookquote">``This looks like a horror movie waiting to happen,''  (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div>I snickered.
<div class="bookquote">``Well,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Edward</b></font>) muttered as we slowly approached the ticket table  he (<font color='blue'><b>Edward</b></font>) was carrying most of my weight, but
I still had to shuffle and wobble my feet forward  <div class="bookquote">``there are more than enough vampires present.''
 (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div>I looked at the dance floor; a wide gap had formed in the center of the floor, where two couples whirled
gracefully. The other dancers pressed to the sides of the room to give them space  no one wanted to
stand in contrast with such radiance. Emmett and Jasper were intimidating and flawless in classic tuxedos.
Alice was striking in a black satin dress with geometric cutouts that bared large triangles of her (<font color='blue'><b>Alice</b></font>) snowy
white skin. And Rosalie was well, Rosalie. She (<font color='blue'><b>Rosalie</b></font>) was beyond belief. Her (<font color='blue'><b>Rosalie</b></font>) vivid scarlet dress was
backless, tight to her (<font color='blue'><b>Rosalie</b></font>) calves where it flared into a wide ruffled train, with a neckline that plunged to her (<font color='blue'><b>Rosalie</b></font>)
waist. I pitied every girl in the room, myself included.
<div class="bookquote">``Do you want me to bolt the doors so you can massacre the unsuspecting townsfolk?''  (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div>I whispered
conspiratorially.
<div class="bookquote">``And where do you fit into that scheme?''  (<font color='red'><b>He</b></font>)</div>He (<font color='blue'><b>Emmett</b></font>) glared.
<div class="bookquote">``Oh, I'm with the vampires, of course.''
 (<font color='red'><b>He</b></font>)</div>He (<font color='blue'><b>Emmett</b></font>) smiled reluctantly. <div class="bookquote">``Anything to get out of dancing.''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``Anything.''
 (<font color='red'><b>He</b></font>)</div>He (<font color='blue'><b>Emmett</b></font>) bought our tickets, then turned me toward the dance floor. I cringed against his (<font color='blue'><b>Emmett</b></font>) arm and dragged my
feet.
<div class="bookquote">``I've got all night,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Emmett</b></font>) warned.
Eventually he (<font color='blue'><b>Emmett</b></font>) towed me out to where his (<font color='blue'><b>Emmett</b></font>) family was twirling elegantly  if in a style totally unsuitable to
the present time and music. I watched in horror.
<div class="bookquote">``Edward.''  (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div>My throat was so dry I could only manage a whisper. <div class="bookquote">``I honestly can't dance!''  (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div>I could feel
the panic bubbling up inside my chest.
<div class="bookquote">``Don't worry, silly,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Emmett</b></font>) whispered back. <div class="bookquote">``I can.''  (<font color='red'><b>He</b></font>)</div>He (<font color='blue'><b>Emmett</b></font>) put my arms around his (<font color='blue'><b>Emmett</b></font>) neck and lifted me to slide
his (<font color='blue'><b>Emmett</b></font>) feet under mine.
And then we were whirling, too.
<div class="bookquote">``I feel like I'm five years old,''  (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div>I laughed after a few minutes of effortless waltzing.
<div class="bookquote">``You don't look five,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Emmett</b></font>) murmured, pulling me closer for a second, so that my feet were briefly a foot
from the ground.
Alice caught my eye on a turn and smiled in encouragement  I smiled back. I was surprised to realize
that I was actually enjoying myself a little.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Okay, this isn't half bad,''  (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div>I admitted.
But Edward was staring toward the doors, and his (<font color='blue'><b>Edward</b></font>) face was angry.
<div class="bookquote">``What is it?''  (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div>I wondered aloud. I followed his (<font color='blue'><b>Edward</b></font>) gaze, disoriented by the spinning, but finally I could see
what was bothering him (<font color='blue'><b>Edward</b></font>). Jacob Black, not in a tux, but in a long-sleeved white shirt and tie, his (<font color='blue'><b>Black</b></font>) hair
smoothed back into his (<font color='blue'><b>Black</b></font>) usual ponytail, was crossing the floor toward us.
After the first shock of recognition, I couldn't help but feel bad for Jacob. He (<font color='blue'><b>Jacob</b></font>) was clearly uncomfortable
 excruciatingly so. His (<font color='blue'><b>Jacob</b></font>) face was apologetic as his (<font color='blue'><b>Jacob</b></font>) eyes met mine.
Edward snarled very quietly.
<div class="bookquote">``Behave!''  (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div>I hissed.
Edward's voice was scathing. <div class="bookquote">``He (<font color='blue'><b>Edward</b></font>) wants to chat with you.''
 (<font color='red'><b>Jacob/Jacob Black</b></font>)</div>Jacob reached us then, the embarrassment and apology even more evident on his (<font color='blue'><b>Jacob</b></font>) face.
<div class="bookquote">``Hey, Bella, I was hoping you would be here.''  (<font color='red'><b>Jacob/Jacob Black</b></font>)</div>Jacob sounded like he (<font color='blue'><b>Jacob</b></font>)'d been hoping the exact opposite.
But his (<font color='blue'><b>Jacob</b></font>) smile was just as warm as ever.
<div class="bookquote">``Hi, Jacob.''  (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div>I smiled back. <div class="bookquote">``What's up?''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``Can I cut in?''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Jacob</b></font>) asked tentatively, glancing at Edward for the first time. I was shocked to notice that
Jacob didn't have to look up. He (<font color='blue'><b>Jacob</b></font>) must have grown half a foot since the first time I'd seen him (<font color='blue'><b>Jacob</b></font>).
Edward's face was composed, his (<font color='blue'><b>Edward</b></font>) expression blank. His (<font color='blue'><b>Edward</b></font>) only answer was to set me carefully on my feet,
and take a step back.
<div class="bookquote">``Thanks,''  (<font color='red'><b>Jacob/Jacob Black</b></font>)</div>Jacob said amiably.
Edward just nodded, looking at me intently before he (<font color='blue'><b>Edward</b></font>) turned to walk away.
Jacob put his (<font color='blue'><b>Jacob</b></font>) hands on my waist, and I reached up to put my hands on his (<font color='blue'><b>Jacob</b></font>) shoulders.
<div class="bookquote">``Wow, Jake, how tall are you now?''
 (<font color='red'><b>He</b></font>)</div>He (<font color='blue'><b>Jacob</b></font>) was smug. <div class="bookquote">``Six-two.''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>We weren't really dancing  my leg made that impossible. Instead we swayed awkwardly from side to
side without moving our feet. It was just as well; the recent growth spurt had left him (<font color='blue'><b>Jacob</b></font>) looking gangly and
uncoordinated, he (<font color='blue'><b>Jacob</b></font>) was probably no better a dancer than I was.
<div class="bookquote">``So, how did you end up here tonight?''  (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div>I asked without true curiosity. Considering Edward's reaction, I
could guess.
<div class="bookquote">``Can you believe my dad paid me twenty bucks to come to your prom?''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Edward</b></font>) admitted, slightly ashamed.
<div class="bookquote">``Yes, I can,''  (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div>I muttered. <div class="bookquote">``Well, I hope you're enjoying yourself, at least. Seen anything you like?''  (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div>I
teased, nodding toward a group of girls lined up against the wall like pastel confections.
<div class="bookquote">``Yeah,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Edward</b></font>) sighed. <div class="bookquote">``But she (<font color='blue'><b>you</b></font>)'s taken.''
 (<font color='red'><b>He</b></font>)</div>He (<font color='blue'><b>Edward</b></font>) glanced down to meet my curious gaze for just a second  then we both looked away,
embarrassed.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``You look really pretty, by the way,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Edward</b></font>) added shyly.
<div class="bookquote">``Um, thanks. So why did Billy pay you to come here?''  (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div>I asked quickly, though I knew the answer.
Jacob didn't seem grateful for the subject change; he (<font color='blue'><b>Jacob</b></font>) looked away, uncomfortable again. <div class="bookquote">``He (<font color='blue'><b>Billy</b></font>) said it was
a `safe' place to talk to you. I swear the old man is losing his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) mind.''
 (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div>I joined in his (<font color='blue'><b>Jacob</b></font>) laughter weakly.
<div class="bookquote">``Anyway, he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) said that if I told you something, he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) would get me that master cylinder I need,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Jacob</b></font>) confessed
with a sheepish grin.
<div class="bookquote">``Tell me, then. I want you to get your car finished.''  (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div>I grinned back. At least Jacob didn't believe any of
this. It made the situation a bit easier. Against the wall, Edward was watching my face, his (<font color='blue'><b>Edward</b></font>) own face
expressionless. I saw a sophomore in a pink dress eyeing him (<font color='blue'><b>Edward</b></font>) with timid speculation, but he (<font color='blue'><b>Edward</b></font>) didn't seem
to be aware of her (<font color='blue'><b>Jacob</b></font>).
Jacob looked away again, ashamed. <div class="bookquote">``Don't get mad, okay?''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``There's no way I'll be mad at you, Jacob,''  (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div>I assured him (<font color='blue'><b>Jacob</b></font>). <div class="bookquote">``I won't even be mad at Billy. Just say what
you have to.''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``Well  this is so stupid, I'm sorry, Bella  he (<font color='blue'><b>Jacob</b></font>) wants you to break up with your boyfriend. He (<font color='blue'><b>Jacob</b></font>) asked
me to tell you `please.'''  (<font color='red'><b>He</b></font>)</div>He (<font color='blue'><b>Jacob</b></font>) shook his (<font color='blue'><b>Jacob</b></font>) head in disgust.
<div class="bookquote">``He (<font color='blue'><b>Jacob</b></font>)'s still superstitious, eh?''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>``Yeah. He (<font color='blue'><b>Jacob</b></font>) was kind of over the top when you got hurt down in Phoenix. He (<font color='blue'><b>Jacob</b></font>) didn't believe``Jacob
trailed off self-consciously.
My eyes narrowed. <div class="bookquote">``I fell.''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``I know that,''  (<font color='red'><b>Jacob/Jacob Black</b></font>)</div>Jacob said quickly.
<div class="bookquote">``He (<font color='blue'><b>Jacob</b></font>) thinks Edward had something to do with me getting hurt.''  (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div>It wasn't a question, and despite my
promise, I was angry.
Jacob wouldn't meet my eyes. We weren't even bothering to sway to the music, though his (<font color='blue'><b>Jacob</b></font>) hands were
still on my waist, and mine around his (<font color='blue'><b>Jacob</b></font>) neck.
<div class="bookquote">``Look, Jacob, I know Billy probably won't believe this, but just so you know''   (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Jacob</b></font>) looked at me now,
responding to the new earnestness in my voice  <div class="bookquote">``Edward really did save my life. If it weren't for
Edward and his (<font color='blue'><b>Edward</b></font>) father, I'd be dead.''
 (<font color='red'><b>me</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``I know,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Jacob</b></font>) claimed, but he (<font color='blue'><b>Jacob</b></font>) sounded like my sincere words had affected him (<font color='blue'><b>Jacob</b></font>) some. Maybe he (<font color='blue'><b>Jacob</b></font>)'d be able
to convince Billy of this much, at least.
<div class="bookquote">``Hey, I'm sorry you had to come do this, Jacob,''  (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div>I apologized. <div class="bookquote">``At any rate, you get your parts, right?''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``Yeah,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Billy</b></font>) muttered. He (<font color='blue'><b>Billy</b></font>) was still looking awkward upset.
<div class="bookquote">``There's more?''  (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div>I asked in disbelief.
<div class="bookquote">``Forget it,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Billy</b></font>) mumbled, <div class="bookquote">``I'll get a job and save the money myself.''

 (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div><p/>I glared at him (<font color='blue'><b>Billy</b></font>) until he (<font color='blue'><b>Billy</b></font>) met my gaze. <div class="bookquote">``Just spit it out, Jacob.''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``It's so bad.''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``I don't care. Tell me,''  (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div>I insisted.
<div class="bookquote">``Okay but, geez, this sounds bad.''  (<font color='red'><b>He</b></font>)</div>He (<font color='blue'><b>Billy</b></font>) shook his (<font color='blue'><b>Billy</b></font>) head. <div class="bookquote">``He (<font color='blue'><b>Jacob</b></font>) said to tell you, no, to warn you, that 
and this is his (<font color='blue'><b>Jacob</b></font>) plural, not mine''   (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Billy</b></font>) lifted one hand from my waist and made little quotations marks in
the air  '<div class="bookquote">``We'll be watching.'''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>He (<font color='blue'><b>Billy</b></font>) watched warily for my reaction.
It sounded like something from a mafia movie. I laughed out loud.
<div class="bookquote">``Sorry you had to do this, Jake,''  (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div>I snickered.
<div class="bookquote">``I don't mind that much.''  (<font color='red'><b>He</b></font>)</div>He (<font color='blue'><b>Billy</b></font>) grinned in relief. His (<font color='blue'><b>Billy</b></font>) eyes were appraising as they raked quickly over my
dress. <div class="bookquote">``So, should I tell him (<font color='blue'><b>Jake</b></font>) you said to butt the hell out?''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Billy</b></font>) asked hopefully.
<div class="bookquote">``No,''  (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div>I sighed. <div class="bookquote">``Tell him (<font color='blue'><b>Jake</b></font>) I said thanks. I know he (<font color='blue'><b>Jake</b></font>) means well.''
 (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div>The song ended, and I dropped my arms.
His (<font color='blue'><b>Billy</b></font>) hands hesitated at my waist, and he (<font color='blue'><b>Billy</b></font>) glanced at my bum leg. <div class="bookquote">``Do you want to dance again? Or can I
help you get somewhere?''
 (<font color='red'><b>Edward/Edward Cullen/Cullen</b></font>)</div>Edward answered for me. <div class="bookquote">``That's all right, Jacob. I'll take it from here.''
 (<font color='red'><b>Jacob/Jacob Black</b></font>)</div>Jacob flinched, and stared wide-eyed at Edward, who stood just beside us.
<div class="bookquote">``Hey, I didn't see you there,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Jacob</b></font>) mumbled. <div class="bookquote">``I guess I'll see you around, Bella.''  (<font color='red'><b>He</b></font>)</div>He (<font color='blue'><b>Jacob</b></font>) stepped back, waving
halfheartedly.
I smiled. <div class="bookquote">``Yeah, I'll see you later.''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``Sorry,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Jacob</b></font>) said again before he (<font color='blue'><b>Jacob</b></font>) turned for the door.
Edward's arms wound around me as the next song started. It was a little up-tempo for slow dancing, but
that didn't seem to concern him (<font color='blue'><b>Edward</b></font>). I leaned my head against his (<font color='blue'><b>Edward</b></font>) chest, content.
<div class="bookquote">``Feeling better?''  (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div>I teased.
<div class="bookquote">``Not really,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Edward</b></font>) said tersely.
<div class="bookquote">``Don't be mad at Billy,''  (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div>I sighed. <div class="bookquote">``He (<font color='blue'><b>Billy</b></font>) just worries about me for Charlie's sake. It's nothing personal.''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``I'm not mad at Billy,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Edward</b></font>) corrected in a clipped voice. <div class="bookquote">``But his (<font color='blue'><b>Billy</b></font>) son is irritating me.''
 (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div>I pulled back to look at him (<font color='blue'><b>Edward</b></font>). His (<font color='blue'><b>Edward</b></font>) face was very serious.
<div class="bookquote">``Why?''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``First of all, he (<font color='blue'><b>Billy</b></font>) made me break my promise.''
 (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div>I stared at him (<font color='blue'><b>Edward</b></font>) in confusion.
He (<font color='blue'><b>Edward</b></font>) half-smiled. <div class="bookquote">``I promised I wouldn't let go of you tonight,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Edward</b></font>) explained.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Oh. Well, I forgive you.''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``Thanks. But there's something else.''  (<font color='red'><b>Edward/Edward Cullen/Cullen</b></font>)</div>Edward frowned.
I waited patiently.
<div class="bookquote">``He (<font color='blue'><b>Billy</b></font>) called you pretty,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Edward</b></font>) finally continued, his (<font color='blue'><b>Edward</b></font>) frown deepening. <div class="bookquote">``That's practically an insult, the way
you look right now. You're much more than beautiful.''
 (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div>I laughed. <div class="bookquote">``You might be a little biased.''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``I don't think that's it. Besides, I have excellent eyesight.''
 (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>We were twirling again, my feet on his (<font color='blue'><b>Edward</b></font>) as he (<font color='blue'><b>Edward</b></font>) held me close.
<div class="bookquote">``So are you going to explain the reason for all of this?''  (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div>I wondered.
He (<font color='blue'><b>Edward</b></font>) looked down at me, confused, and I glared meaningfully at the crepe paper.
He (<font color='blue'><b>Edward</b></font>) considered for a moment, and then changed direction, spinning me through the crowd to the back
door of the gym. I caught a glimpse of Jessica and Mike dancing, staring at me curiously. Jessica waved,
and I smiled back quickly. Angela was there, too, looking blissfully happy in the arms of little Ben
Cheney; she (<font color='blue'><b>Angela</b></font>) didn't look up from his (<font color='blue'><b>Cheney</b></font>) eyes, a head lower than hers. Lee and Samantha, Lauren, glaring
toward us, with Conner; I could name every face that spiraled past me. And then we were outdoors, in
the cool, dim light of a fading sunset.
As soon as we were alone, he (<font color='blue'><b>Conner</b></font>) swung me up into his (<font color='blue'><b>Conner</b></font>) arms, and carried me across the dark grounds till he (<font color='blue'><b>Conner</b></font>)
reached the bench beneath the shadow of the madrone trees. He (<font color='blue'><b>Conner</b></font>) sat there, keeping me cradled against
his (<font color='blue'><b>Conner</b></font>) chest. The moon was already up, visible through the gauzy clouds, and his (<font color='blue'><b>Conner</b></font>) face glowed pale in the
white light. His (<font color='blue'><b>Conner</b></font>) mouth was hard, his (<font color='blue'><b>Conner</b></font>) eyes troubled.
<div class="bookquote">``The point?''  (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div>I prompted softly.
He (<font color='blue'><b>Conner</b></font>) ignored me, staring up at the moon.
<div class="bookquote">``Twilight, again,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Conner</b></font>) murmured. <div class="bookquote">``Another ending. No matter how perfect the day is, it always has to end.''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``Some things don't have to end,''  (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div>I muttered through my teeth, instantly tense.
He (<font color='blue'><b>Conner</b></font>) sighed.
<div class="bookquote">``I brought you to the prom,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Conner</b></font>) said slowly, finally answering my question, <div class="bookquote">``because I don't want you to
miss anything. I don't want my presence to take anything away from you, if I can help it. I want you to
be human. I want your life to continue as it would have if I'd died in nineteen-eighteen like I should
have.''
 (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>I shuddered at his (<font color='blue'><b>Conner</b></font>) words, and then shook my head angrily. <div class="bookquote">``In what strange parallel dimension would I
ever have gone to prom of my own free will? If you weren't a thousand times stronger than me, I would
never have let you get away with this.''
 (<font color='red'><b>He</b></font>)</div>He (<font color='blue'><b>Conner</b></font>) smiled briefly, but it didn't touch his (<font color='blue'><b>Conner</b></font>) eyes. <div class="bookquote">``It wasn't so bad, you said so yourself.''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``That's because I was with you.''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>We were quiet for a minute; he (<font color='blue'><b>Conner</b></font>) stared at the moon and I stared at him (<font color='blue'><b>Conner</b></font>). I wished there was some way to

<p/>explain how very uninterested I was in a normal human life.
<div class="bookquote">``Will you tell me something?''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Conner</b></font>) asked, glancing down at me with a slight smile.
<div class="bookquote">``Don't I always?''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``Just promise you'll tell me,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Conner</b></font>) insisted, grinning.
I knew I was going to regret this almost instantly. <div class="bookquote">``Fine.''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``You seemed honestly surprised when you figured out that I was taking you here,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Conner</b></font>) began.
<div class="bookquote">``I was,''  (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div>I interjected.
<div class="bookquote">``Exactly,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Conner</b></font>) agreed. <div class="bookquote">``But you must have had some other theory I'm curious  what did you think I
was dressing you up for?''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>Yes, instant regret. I pursed my lips, hesitating. <div class="bookquote">``I don't want to tell you.''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``You promised,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Conner</b></font>) objected.
<div class="bookquote">``I know.''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``What's the problem?''
 (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div>I knew he (<font color='blue'><b>Conner</b></font>) thought it was mere embarrassment holding me back. <div class="bookquote">``I think it will make you mad  or sad.''
 (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>His (<font color='blue'><b>Conner</b></font>) brows pulled together over his (<font color='blue'><b>Conner</b></font>) eyes as he (<font color='blue'><b>Conner</b></font>) thought that through. <div class="bookquote">``I still want to know. Please?''
 (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div>I sighed. He (<font color='blue'><b>Conner</b></font>) waited.
<div class="bookquote">``Well I assumed it was some kind of occasion. But I didn't think it would be some trite human
thing prom!''  (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div>I scoffed.
<div class="bookquote">``Human?''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Conner</b></font>) asked flatly. He (<font color='blue'><b>Conner</b></font>)'d picked up on the key word.
I looked down at my dress, fidgeting with a stray piece of chiffon. He (<font color='blue'><b>Conner</b></font>) waited in silence.
<div class="bookquote">``Okay,''  (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div>I confessed in a rush. <div class="bookquote">``So I was hoping that you might have changed your mind that you were
going to change me, after all.''
 (<font color='red'><b>dozen</b></font>)</div>A dozen emotions played across his (<font color='blue'><b>Conner</b></font>) face. Some I recognized: anger pain and then he (<font color='blue'><b>Conner</b></font>) seemed to
collect himself and his (<font color='blue'><b>Conner</b></font>) expression became amused.
<div class="bookquote">``You thought that would be a black tie occasion, did you?''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Conner</b></font>) teased, touching the lapel of his (<font color='blue'><b>Conner</b></font>) tuxedo
jacket.
I scowled to hide my embarrassment. <div class="bookquote">``I don't know how these things work. To me, at least, it seems
more rational than prom does.''  (<font color='red'><b>He</b></font>)</div>He (<font color='blue'><b>Conner</b></font>) was still grinning. <div class="bookquote">``It's not funny,''  (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div>I said.
<div class="bookquote">``No, you're right, it's not,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Conner</b></font>) agreed, his (<font color='blue'><b>Conner</b></font>) smile fading. <div class="bookquote">``I'd rather treat it like a joke, though, than believe
you're serious.''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``But I am serious.''
 (<font color='red'><b>He</b></font>)</div>He (<font color='blue'><b>Conner</b></font>) sighed deeply. <div class="bookquote">``I know. And you're really that willing?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/>The pain was back in his (<font color='blue'><b>Conner</b></font>) eyes. I bit my lip and nodded.
<div class="bookquote">``So ready for this to be the end,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Conner</b></font>) murmured, almost to himself, <div class="bookquote">``for this to be the twilight of your life,
though your life has barely started. You're ready to give up everything.''
 (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``It's not the end, it's the beginning,''  (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div>I disagreed under my breath.
<div class="bookquote">``I'm not worth it,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Conner</b></font>) said sadly.
<div class="bookquote">``Do you remember when you told me that I didn't see myself very clearly?''  (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div>I asked, raising my
eyebrows. <div class="bookquote">``You obviously have the same blindness.''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``I know what I am.''
 (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div>I sighed.
But his (<font color='blue'><b>Conner</b></font>) mercurial mood shifted on me. He (<font color='blue'><b>Conner</b></font>) pursed his (<font color='blue'><b>Conner</b></font>) lips, and his (<font color='blue'><b>Conner</b></font>) eyes were probing. He (<font color='blue'><b>Conner</b></font>) examined my
face for a long moment.
<div class="bookquote">``You're ready now, then?''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Conner</b></font>) asked.
<div class="bookquote">``Um.''  (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div>I gulped. <div class="bookquote">``Yes?''
 (<font color='red'><b>He</b></font>)</div>He (<font color='blue'><b>Conner</b></font>) smiled, and inclined his (<font color='blue'><b>Conner</b></font>) head slowly until his (<font color='blue'><b>Conner</b></font>) cold lips brushed against the skin just under the corner of
my jaw.
<div class="bookquote">``Right now?''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Conner</b></font>) whispered, his (<font color='blue'><b>Conner</b></font>) breath blowing cool on my neck. I shivered involuntarily.
<div class="bookquote">``Yes,''  (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div>I whispered, so my voice wouldn't have a chance to break. If he (<font color='blue'><b>Conner</b></font>) thought I was bluffing, he (<font color='blue'><b>Conner</b></font>) was
going to be disappointed. I'd already made this decision, and I was sure. It didn't matter that my body
was rigid as a plank, my hands balled into fists, my breathing erratic
He (<font color='blue'><b>Conner</b></font>) chuckled darkly, and leaned away. His (<font color='blue'><b>Conner</b></font>) face did look disappointed.
<div class="bookquote">``You can't really believe that I would give in so easily,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Conner</b></font>) said with a sour edge to his (<font color='blue'><b>Conner</b></font>) mocking tone.
<div class="bookquote">``A girl can dream.''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>His (<font color='blue'><b>Conner</b></font>) eyebrows rose. <div class="bookquote">``Is that what you dream about? Being a monster?''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``Not exactly,''  (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div>I said, frowning at his (<font color='blue'><b>Conner</b></font>) word choice. Monster, indeed. <div class="bookquote">``Mostly I dream about being with
you forever.''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>His (<font color='blue'><b>Conner</b></font>) expression changed, softened and saddened by the subtle ache in my voice.
<div class="bookquote">``Bella.''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>His (<font color='blue'><b>Conner</b></font>) fingers lightly traced the shape of my lips. <div class="bookquote">``I will stay with you  isn't that enough?''
 (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div>I smiled under his (<font color='blue'><b>Conner</b></font>) fingertips. <div class="bookquote">``Enough for now.''
 (<font color='red'><b>He</b></font>)</div>He (<font color='blue'><b>Conner</b></font>) frowned at my tenacity. No one was going to surrender tonight. He (<font color='blue'><b>Conner</b></font>) exhaled, and the sound was
practically a growl.
I touched his (<font color='blue'><b>Conner</b></font>) face. <div class="bookquote">``Look,''  (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div>I said. <div class="bookquote">``I love you more than everything else in the world combined. Isn't that
enough?''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``Yes, it is enough,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Conner</b></font>) answered, smiling. <div class="bookquote">``Enough for forever.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/>And he (<font color='blue'><b>Conner</b></font>) leaned down to press his (<font color='blue'><b>Conner</b></font>) cold lips once more to my throat.
