<p/>by J.K. Rowling

<p/>CHAPTER ONE

<p/>OWL POST

<p/>Harry Potter was a highly unusual boy in many ways. For one thing, he (<font color='blue'><b>Potter</b></font>)
hated the summer holidays more than any other time of year. For another,
he (<font color='blue'><b>Potter</b></font>) really wanted to do his (<font color='blue'><b>Potter</b></font>) homework but was forced to do it in secret,
in the dead of night. And he (<font color='blue'><b>Potter</b></font>) also happened to be a wizard.

<p/>It was nearly midnight, and he (<font color='blue'><b>Potter</b></font>) was lying on his (<font color='blue'><b>Potter</b></font>) stomach in bed, the
blankets drawn right over his (<font color='blue'><b>Potter</b></font>) head like a tent, a flashlight in one hand
and a large leather-bound book -LRB-A History of Magic by Bathilda Bagshot-RRB-
propped open against the pillow. Harry moved the tip of his (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>)
eagle-feather quill down the page, frowning as he (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) looked for something
that would help him (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) write his (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) essay, <div class="bookquote">``Witch Burning in the Fourteenth
Century Was Completely Pointless discuss.''

 (<font color='red'><b>him</b></font>)</div><p/>The quill paused at the top of a likely-looking paragraph. Harry Pushed
his (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) round glasses up the bridge of his (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) nose, moved his (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) flashlight closer
to the book, and read:

<p/>Non-magic people -LRB-more commonly known as Muggles-RRB- were particularly
afraid of magic in medieval times, but not very good at recognizing it.
On the rare occasion that they did catch a real witch or wizard, burning
had no effect whatsoever. The witch or wizard would perform a basic
Flame Freezing Charm and then pretend to shriek with pain while enjoying
a gentle, tickling sensation. Indeed, Wendelin the Weird enjoyed being
burned so much that she (<font color='blue'><b>witch</b></font>) allowed herself to be caught no less than
fortyseven times in various disguises.

<p/>Harry put his (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) quill between his (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) teeth and reached underneath his (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) pillow
for his (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) ink bottle and a roll of parchment. Slowly and very carefully he (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>)
unscrewed the ink bottle, dipped his (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) quill into it, and began to write,
pausing every now and then to listen, because if any of the Dursleys
heard the scratching of his (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) quill on their way to the bathroom, he (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>)'d
probably find himself locked in the cupboard under the stairs for the
rest of the summer.

<p/>The Dursley family of number four, Privet Drive, was the reason that
Harry never enjoyed his (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) summer holidays. Uncle Vernon, Aunt Petunia, and
their son, Dudley, were Harry's only living relatives. They were
Muggles, and they had a very medieval attitude toward magic. Harry's
dead parents, who had been a witch and wizard themselves, were never
mentioned under the Dursleys' roof For years, Aunt Petunia and Uncle
Vernon had hoped that if they kept Harry as downtrodden as possible,
they would be able to squash the magic out of him (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>). To their fury, they
had been unsuccessful. These days they lived in terror of anyone finding
out that Harry had spent most of the last two years at Hogwarts School
of Witchcraft and Wizardry. The most they could do, however, was to lock
away Harry's spellbooks, wand, cauldron, and broomstick at the start of
the summer break, and forbid him (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) to talk to the neighbors.

<p/>This separation from his (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) spellbooks had been a real problem for Harry,
because his (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) teachers at Hogwarts had given him (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) a lot of holiday work.
One of the essays, a particularly nasty one about shrinking potions, was
for Harry's least favorite teacher, Professor Snape, who would be
delighted to have an excuse to give Harry detention for a month. Harry
had therefore seized his (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) chance in the first week of the holidays. While
Uncle Vernon, Aunt Petunia, and Dudley had gone out into the front
garden to admire Uncle Vernon's new company car -LRB-in very loud voices, so
that the rest of the street would notice it too-RRB-, Harry had crept
downstairs, picked the lock on the cupboard under the stairs, grabbed
some of his (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) books, and hidden them in his (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) bedroom. As long as he (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) didn't
leave spots of ink on the sheets, the Dursleys need never know that he (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>)
was studying magic by night.

<p/>Harry was particularly keen to avoid trouble with his (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) aunt and uncle at
the moment, as they were already in an especially bad mood with him (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>), all
because he (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>)'d received a telephone call from a fellow wizard one week
into the school vacation.

<p/>Ron Weasley, who was one of Harry's best friends at Hogwarts, came from
a whole family of wizards. This meant that he (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) knew a lot of things Harry
didn't, but had never used a telephone before. Most unluckily, it had
been Uncle Vernon who had answered the call.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Vernon Dursley speaking.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Harry/Potter/Harry Potter</b></font>)</div><p/>Harry, who happened to be in the room at the time, froze as he (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) heard
Ron's voice answer.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``HELLO? HELLO? CAN YOU HEAR ME? I -- WANT -- TO -- TALK -- TO -- HARRY
-- POTTER!''

 (<font color='red'><b>Ron</b></font>)</div><p/>Ron was yelling so loudly that Uncle Vernon jumped and held the receiver
a foot away from his (<font color='blue'><b>Vernon</b></font>) ear, staring at it with an expression of mingled
fury and alarm.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``WHO IS THIS?''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Vernon</b></font>) roared in the direction of the mouthpiece. <div class="bookquote">``WHO ARE
YOU?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``RON -- WEASLEY!''  (<font color='red'><b>Ron</b></font>)</div>Ron bellowed back, as though he (<font color='blue'><b>Ron</b></font>) and Uncle Vernon were
speaking from opposite ends of a football field. ``I'M -- A -- FRIEND --
OF -- HARRY<div class="bookquote">``S -- FROM -- SCHOOL --''

 (<font color='red'><b>Uncle</b></font>)</div><p/>Uncle Vernon's small eyes swiveled around to Harry, who was rooted to
the spot.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``THERE IS NO HARRY POTTER HERE!''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) roared, now holding the receiver at
arm's length, as though frightened it might explode. ``I DON``T KNOW WHAT
SCHOOL YOURE TALKING ABOUT! NEVER CONTACT ME AGAIN! DON<div class="bookquote">``T YOU COME NEAR
MY FAMILY!''

 (<font color='red'><b>Don/DON</b></font>)</div><p/>And he (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) threw the receiver back onto the telephone as if dropping a
poisonous spider.

<p/>The fight that had followed had been one of the worst ever.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``HOW DARE YOU GIVE THIS NUMBER TO PEOPLE LIKE -- PEOPLE LIKE YOU!''  (<font color='red'><b>Uncle</b></font>)</div>Uncle
Vernon had roared, spraying Harry with spit.

<p/>Ron obviously realized that he (<font color='blue'><b>Ron</b></font>)'d gotten Harry into trouble, because he (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>)
hadn't called again. Harry's other best friend from Hogwarts, Hermione
Granger, hadn't been in touch either. Harry suspected that Ron had
warned Hermione not to call, which was a pity, because Hermione, the
cleverest witch in Harry's year, had Muggle parents, knew perfectly well
how to use a telephone, and would probably have had enough sense not to
say that she (<font color='blue'><b>Hermione</b></font>) went to Hogwarts.

<p/>So Harry had had no word from any of his (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) wizarding friends for five long
weeks, and this summer was turning out to be almost as bad as the last
one. There was just one very small improvement -- after swearing that he (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>)
wouldn't use her (<font color='blue'><b>Hermione</b></font>) to send letters to any of his (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) friends, Harry had been
allowed to let his (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) owl, Hedwig, out at night. Uncle Vernon had given in
because of the racket Hedwig made if she (<font color='blue'><b>Hedwig</b></font>) was locked in her (<font color='blue'><b>Hedwig</b></font>) cage all the
time.

<p/>Harry finished writing about Wendelin the Weird and paused to listen
again. The silence in the dark house was broken only by the distant,
grunting snores of his (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) enormous cousin, Dudley. It must be very late,
Harry thought. His (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) eyes were itching with tiredness. Perhaps he (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>)'d finish
this essay tomorrow night...

<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) replaced the top of the ink bottle; pulled an old pillowcase from
under his (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) bed; put the flashlight, A History of Magic, his (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) essay, quill,
and ink inside it; got out of bed; and hid the lot under a loose
floorboard under his (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) bed. Then he (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) stood up, stretched, and checked the
time on the luminous alarm clock on his (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) bedside table.

<p/>It was one o'clock in the morning. Harry's stomach gave a funny jolt. He (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>)
had been thirteen years old, without realizing it, for a whole hour.

<p/>Yet another unusual thing about Harry was how little he (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) looked forward
to his (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) birthdays. He (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) had never received a birthday card in his (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) life. The
Dursleys had completely ignored his (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) last two birthdays, and he (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) had no
reason to suppose they would remember this one.

<p/>Harry walked across the dark room, past Hedwig's large, empty cage, to
the open window. He (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) leaned on the sill, the cool night air pleasant on
his (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) face after a long time under the blankets. Hedwig had been absent
for two nights now. Harry wasn't worried about her (<font color='blue'><b>Hedwig</b></font>): she (<font color='blue'><b>Hedwig</b></font>)'d been gone this
long before. But he (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) hoped she (<font color='blue'><b>Hedwig</b></font>)'d be back soon -- she (<font color='blue'><b>Hedwig</b></font>) was the only living
creature in this house who didn't flinch at the sight of him (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>).

<p/>Harry, though still rather small and skinny for his (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) age, had grown a few
inches over the last year. His (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) jet-black hair, however, was just as it
always had been -- stubbornly untidy, whatever he (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) did to it. The eyes
behind his (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) glasses were bright green, and on his (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) forehead, clearly
visible through his (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) hair, was a thin scar, shaped like a bolt of
lightning.

<p/>Of all the unusual things about Harry, this scar was the most
extraordinary of all. It was not, as the Dursleys had pretended for ten
years, a souvenir of the car crash that had killed Harry's parents,
because Lily and James Potter had not died in a car crash. They had been
murdered, murdered by the most feared Dark wizard for a hundred years,
Lord Voldemort. Harry had escaped from the same attack with nothing more
than a scar on his (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) forehead, where Voldemort's curse, instead of killing
him (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>), had rebounded upon its originator. Barely alive, Voldemort had
fled...

<p/>But Harry had come face-to-face with him (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) at Hogwarts. Remembering their
last meeting as he (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) stood at the dark window, Harry had to admit he (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) was
lucky even to have reached his (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) thirteenth birthday.

<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) scanned the starry sky for a sign of Hedwig, perhaps soaring

<p/>back to him (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) with a dead mouse dangling from her (<font color='blue'><b>Hedwig</b></font>) beak, expecting praise.
Gazing absently over the rooftops, it was a few seconds before Harry
realized what he (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) was seeing.

<p/>Silhouetted against the golden moon, and growing larger every moment,
was a large, strangely lopsided creature, and it was flapping in Harry's
direction. He (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) stood quite still, watching it sink lower and lower. For a
split second he (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) hesitated, his (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) hand on the window latch, wondering
whether to slam it shut. But then the bizarre creature soared over one
of the street lamps of Privet Drive, and Harry, realizing what it was,
leapt aside.

<p/>Through the window soared three owls, two of them holding up the third,
which appeared to be unconscious. They landed with a soft flump on
Harry's bed, and the middle owl, which was large and gray, keeled right
over and lay motionless. There was a large package tied to its legs.

<p/>Harry recognized the unconscious owl at once -- his (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) name was Errol, and
he (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) belonged to the Weasley family. Harry dashed to the bed, untied the
cords around Errol's legs, took off the parcel, and then carried Errol
to Hedwig's cage. Errol opened one bleary eye, gave a feeble hoot of
thanks, and began to gulp some water.

<p/>Harry turned back to the remaining owls. One of them, the large snowy
female, was his (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) own Hedwig. She (<font color='blue'><b>Hedwig</b></font>), too, was carrying a parcel and looked
extremely pleased with herself. She (<font color='blue'><b>Hedwig</b></font>) gave Harry an affectionate nip with
her (<font color='blue'><b>Hedwig</b></font>) beak as he (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) removed her (<font color='blue'><b>Hedwig</b></font>) burden, then flew across the room to join
Errol.

<p/>Harry didn't recognize the third owl, a handsome tawny one, but he (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) knew
at once where it had come from, because in addition to a third package,
it was carrying a letter bearing the Hogwarts crest. When Harry relieved
this owl of its burden, it ruffled its feathers importantly, stretched
its wings, and took off through the window into the night.

<p/>Harry sat down on his (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) bed and grabbed Errol's package, ripped off the
brown paper, and discovered a present wrapped in gold, and his (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) first
ever birthday card. Fingers trembling slightly, he (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) opened the envelope.
Two pieces of paper fell out -- a letter and a newspaper clipping.

<p/>The clipping had clearly come out of the wizarding newspaper, the Daily
Prophet, because the people in the black-and-white picture were moving.
Harry picked up the clipping, smoothed it out, and read:

<p/>MINISTRY OF MAGIC EMPLOYEE SCOOPS GRAND PRIZE

<p/>Arthur Weasley, Head of the Misuse of Muggle Artifacts Office at the
Ministry of Magic, has won the annual Daily Prophet Grand Prize Galleon
Draw.

<p/>A delighted Mr. Weasley told the Daily Prophet, <div class="bookquote">``We will be spending the
gold on a summer holiday in Egypt, where our eldest son, Bill, works as
a curse breaker for Gringotts Wizarding Bank.''

 (<font color='red'><b>the Daily Prophet</b></font>)</div><p/>The Weasley family will be spending a month in Egypt, returning for the
start of the new school year at Hogwarts, which five of the Weasley
children currently attend.

<p/>Harry scanned the moving photograph, and a grin spread across his (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) face
as he (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) saw all nine of the Weasleys waving furiously at him (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>), standing in
front of a large pyramid. Plump little Mrs. Weasley; tail, balding Mr.
Weasley; six sons; and one daughter, all -LRB-though the black-and-white
picture didn't show it-RRB- with flaming-red hair. Right in the middle of
the picture was Ron, tall and gangling, with his (<font color='blue'><b>Ron</b></font>) pet rat, Scabbers, on
his (<font color='blue'><b>Ron</b></font>) shoulder and his (<font color='blue'><b>Ron</b></font>) arm around his (<font color='blue'><b>Ron</b></font>) little sister, Ginny.

<p/>Harry couldn't think of anyone who deserved to win a large pile of gold
more than the Weasleys, who were very nice and extremely poor. He (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) picked
up Ron's letter and unfolded it.

<p/>Dear Harry,

<p/>Happy birthday!

<p/>Look, I' really sorry about that telephone call. I hope the Muggles
didn't give you a hard time. I asked Dad, and he (<font color='blue'><b>Dad</b></font>) reckons I shouldn't
have shouted.

<p/>It's amazing here in Egypt. Bill's taken us around all the tombs and you
wouldn't believe the curses those old Egyptian wizards put on them. Mum
wouldn't let Ginny come in the last one. There were all these mutant
skeletons in there, of Muggles who'd broken in and grown extra heads and
stuff.

<p/>I couldn't believe it when Dad won the Daily Prophet Draw. Seven hundred
galleons! Most of it's gone on this trip, but they're going to buy me a
new wand for next year.

<p/>Harry remembered only too well the occasion when Ron's old wand had
snapped. It had happened when the car the two of them had been flying to
Hogwarts had crashed into a tree on the school grounds.

<p/>We'll be back about a week before term starts and we'll be going up to
London to get my wand and our new books. Any chance of meeting you
there?

<p/>Don't let the Muggles get you down!

<p/>Try and come to London,

<p/>Ron

<p/>P.S. Percy's Head Boy. He (<font color='blue'><b>Ron</b></font>) got the letter last week.

<p/>Harry glanced back at the photograph. Percy, who was in his (<font color='blue'><b>Percy</b></font>) seventh and
final year at Hogwarts, was looking particularly smug. He (<font color='blue'><b>Hogwarts</b></font>) had pinned his (<font color='blue'><b>Hogwarts</b></font>)
Head Boy badge to the fez perched jauntily on top of his (<font color='blue'><b>Hogwarts</b></font>) neat hair, his (<font color='blue'><b>Hogwarts</b></font>)
horn-rimmed glasses flashing in the Egyptian sun.

<p/>Harry now turned to his (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) present and unwrapped it. Inside was what looked
like a miniature glass spinning top. There was another note from Ron
beneath it.

<p/>Harry -- this is a Pocket Sneakoscope. If there's someone untrustworthy
around, it's supposed to light up and spin. Bill says it's rubbish sold
for wizard tourists and isn't reliable, because it kept lighting up at
dinner last night. But he (<font color='blue'><b>Bill</b></font>) didn't realize Fred and George had put beetles
in his (<font color='blue'><b>Fred</b></font>) soup.

<p/>Bye --

<p/>Ron

<p/>Harry put the Pocket Sneakoscope on his (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) bedside table, where it stood
quite still, balanced on its point, reflecting the luminous hands of his (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>)
clock. He (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) looked at it happily for a few seconds, then picked up the
parcel Hedwig had brought.

<p/>Inside this, too, there was a wrapped present, a card, and a letter,
this time from Hermione.

<p/>Dear Harry,

<p/>Ron wrote to me and told me about his (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) phone call to your Uncle Vernon. I
do hope you're all right.

<p/>I'm on holiday in France at the moment and I didn't know how I was going
to send this to you -- what if they'd opened it at customs? -- but then
Hedwig turned up! I think she (<font color='blue'><b>Hedwig</b></font>) wanted to make sure you got something for
your birthday for a change. I bought your present by owl-order; there
was an advertisement in the Daily Prophet -LRB-I've been getting it
delivered; it's so good to keep up with what's going on in the wizarding
world-RRB-, Did you see that picture of Ron and his (<font color='blue'><b>Ron</b></font>) family a week ago? I bet
he (<font color='blue'><b>Ron</b></font>)'s learning loads. I'm really jealous -- the ancient Egyptian wizards
were fascinating.

<p/>There's some interesting local history of witchcraft here, too. I've
rewritten my whole History of Magic essay to include some of the things
I've found out, I hope it's not too long -- it's two rolls of parchment
more than Professor Binns asked for.

<p/>Ron says he (<font color='blue'><b>Ron</b></font>)'s going to be in London in the last week of the holidays.
Can you make it? Will your aunt and uncle let you come? I really hope
you can. If not, I'll see you on the Hogwarts Express on September
first!

<p/>Love from Hermione

<p/>P.S. Ron says Percy's Head Boy. I'll bet Percy's really pleased Ron
doesn't seem too happy about it

<p/>Harry laughed as he (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) put Herrmone's letter aside and picked up her (<font color='blue'><b>Hermione</b></font>)
present. It was very heavy. Knowing Hermione, he (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) was sure it would be a
large book full of very difficult spells -- but it wasn't. His (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) heart
gave a huge bound as he (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) ripped back the paper and saw a sleek black
leather case, with silver words stamped across it, reading Broomstick
Servicing Kit.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Wow, Hermione!''  (<font color='red'><b>Harry/Potter/Harry Potter</b></font>)</div>Harry whispered, unzipping the case to look inside.

<p/>There was a large jar of Fleetwood's High-Finish Handle Polish, a pair
of gleaming silver Tall-Twig Clippers, a tiny brass compass to clip on
your broom for long journeys, and a Handbook of Do-It-Yourself
Broomcare.

<p/>Apart from his (<font color='blue'><b>Fleetwood</b></font>) friends, the thing that Harry missed most about Hogwarts
was Quidditch, the most popular sport in the magical world -- highly
dangerous, very exciting, and played on broomsticks. Harry happened to
be a very good Quidditch player; he (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) had been the youngest person in a
century to be picked for one of the Hogwarts House teams. One of Harry's
most prized possessions was his (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) Nimbus Two Thousand racing broom.

<p/>Harry put the leather case aside and picked up his (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) last parcel. He (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>)
recognized the untidy scrawl on the brown paper at once: this was from
Hagrid, the Hogwarts gamekeeper. He (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) tore off the top layer of paper and
glimpsed something green and leathery, but before he (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) could unwrap it
properly, the parcel gave a strange quiver, and whatever was inside it
snapped loudly -- as though it had jaws.

<p/>Harry froze. He (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) knew that Hagrid would never send him (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) anything dangerous
on purpose, but then, Hagrid didn't have a normal person's view of what
was dangerous. Hagrid had been known to befriend giant spiders, buy
vicious, three-headed dogs from men in pubs, and sneak illegal dragon
eggs into his (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) cabin.

<p/>Harry poked the parcel nervously. It snapped loudly again. Harry reached
for the lamp on his (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) bedside table, gripped it firmly in one hand, and
raised it over his (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) head, ready to strike. Then he (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) seized the rest of the
wrapping paper in his (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) other hand and pulled.

<p/>And out fell -- a book. Harry just had time to register its handsome
green cover, emblazoned with the golden title The Monster Book of
Monsters, before it flipped onto its edge and scuttled sideways along
the bed like some weird crab.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Uh-oh,''  (<font color='red'><b>Harry/Potter/Harry Potter</b></font>)</div>Harry muttered.

<p/>The book toppled off the bed with a loud clunk and shuffled rapidly
across the room. Harry followed it stealthily. The book was hiding in
the dark space under his (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) desk. Praying that the Dursleys were still fast
asleep, Harry got down on his (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) hands and knees and reached toward it.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Ouch!''

 (<font color='red'><b>him</b></font>)</div><p/>The book snapped shut on his (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) hand and then flapped past him (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>), still
scuttling on its covers. Harry scrambled around, threw himself forward,
and managed to flatten it. Uncle Vernon gave a loud, sleepy grunt in the
room next door.

<p/>Hedwig and Errol watched interestedly as Harry clamped the struggling
book tightly in his (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) arms, hurried to his (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) chest of drawers, and pulled
out a belt, which he (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) buckled tightly around it. The Monster Book
shuddered angrily, but could no longer flap and snap, so Harry threw it
down on the bed and reached for Hagrid's card.

<p/>Dear Harry,

<p/>Happy Birthday!

<p/>Think you might find this useful for next year. Won't say no more here.
Tell you when I see you. Hope the Muggles are treating you right.

<p/>All the best,

<p/>Hagrid

<p/>It struck Harry as ominous that Hagrid thought a biting book would come
in useful, but he (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) put Hagrid's card up next to Ron's and Hermione's,
grinning more broadly than ever. Now there was only the letter from
Hogwarts left.

<p/>Noticing that it was rather thicker than usual, Harry slit open the
envelope, pulled out the first page of parchment within, and read:

<p/>Dear Mr. Potter,

<p/>Please note that the new school year will begin on September the first.
The Hogwarts Express will leave ftom King's Cross station, platform nine
and three-quarters, at eleven o'clock.

<p/>Third years are permitted to visit the village of Hogsmeade on certain
weekends. Please give the enclosed permission form to your parent or
guardian to sign.

<p/>A list of books for next year is enclosed. Yours sincerely,

<p/>Professor M. McGonagall

<p/>Deputy Headmistress

<p/>Harry pulled out the Hogsmeade permission form and looked at it, no
longer grinning. It would be wonderful to visit Hogsmeade on weekends;
he (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) knew it was an entirely wizarding village, and he (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) had never set foot
there. But how on earth was he (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) going to persuade Uncle Vernon or Aunt
Petunia to sign the form?

<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) looked over at the alarm clock. It was now two o'clock in the
morning.

<p/>Deciding that he (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>)'d worry about the Hogsmeade form when he (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) woke up, Harry
got back into bed and reached up to cross off another day on the chart
he (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>)'d made for himself, counting down the days left until his (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) return to
Hogwarts. Then he (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) took off his (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) glasses and lay down, eyes open, facing
his (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) three birthday cards.

<p/>Extremely unusual though he (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) was, at that moment Harry Potter felt just
like everyone else -- glad, for the first time in his (<font color='blue'><b>Potter</b></font>) life, that it was
his (<font color='blue'><b>Potter</b></font>) birthday.

<p/>CHAPTER TWO

<p/>AUNT MARGE``S BIG MISTAKE

<p/>Harry went down to breakfast the next morning to find the three Dursleys
already sitting around the kitchen table. They were watching a brand-new
television, a welcome-home-for-the-summer present for Dudley, who had
been complaining loudly about the long walk between the fridge and the
television in the living room. Dudley had spent most of the summer in
the kitchen, his (<font color='blue'><b>Dudley</b></font>) piggy little eyes fixed on the screen and his (<font color='blue'><b>Dudley</b></font>) five
chins wobbling as he (<font color='blue'><b>Dudley</b></font>) ate continually.

<p/>Harry sat down between Dudley and Uncle Vernon, a large, beefy man with
very little neck and a lot of mustache. Far from wishing Harry a happy
birthday, none of the Dursleys made any sign that they had noticed Harry
enter the room, but Harry was far too used to this to care. He (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) helped
himself to a piece of toast and then looked up at the reporter on the
television, who was halfway through a report on an escaped convict:

<p/><div class="bookquote">''... The public is warned that Black is armed and extremely dangerous. A
special hot line has been set up, and any sighting of Black should be
reported immediately.''

 (<font color='red'><b>the reporter</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``No need to tell us he (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>)'s no good,''  (<font color='red'><b>Vernon/Uncle Vernon</b></font>)</div>snorted Uncle Vernon, staring over
the top of his (<font color='blue'><b>Vernon</b></font>) newspaper at the prisoner. <div class="bookquote">``Look at the state of him (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>), the
filthy layabout! Look at his (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) hair!''

 (<font color='red'><b>He</b></font>)</div><p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Vernon</b></font>) shot a nasty look sideways at Harry, whose untidy hair had always
been a source of great annoyance to Uncle Vernon. Compared to the man on
the television, however, whose gaunt face was surrounded by a matted,
elbow-length tangle, Harry felt very well groomed indeed.

<p/>The reporter had reappeared.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``The Ministry of Agriculture and Fisheries will announce today --''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Hang on!''  (<font color='red'><b>Uncle</b></font>)</div>barked Uncle Vernon, staring furiously at the reporter. <div class="bookquote">``You
didn't tell us where that maniac's escaped from! \What use is that?
Lunatic could be coming up the street right now!''

 (<font color='red'><b>Aunt</b></font>)</div><p/>Aunt Petunia, who was bony and horse-faced, whipped around and peered
intently out of the kitchen window. Harry knew Aunt Petunia would simply
love to be the one to call the hot line number. She (<font color='blue'><b>Aunt</b></font>) was the nosiest
woman in the world and spent most of her (<font color='blue'><b>Aunt</b></font>) life spying on the boring,
law-abiding neighbors.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``When will they learn,''  (<font color='red'><b>Uncle</b></font>)</div>said Uncle Vernon, pounding the table with his (<font color='blue'><b>Vernon</b></font>)
large purple fist, <div class="bookquote">``that hanging's the only way to deal with these
people?''

 (<font color='red'><b>Vernon/Uncle Vernon</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Very true,''  (<font color='red'><b>Petunia/Aunt Petunia</b></font>)</div>said Aunt Petunia, who was still squinting into next door's
runner beans.

<p/>Uncle Vernon drained his (<font color='blue'><b>Vernon</b></font>) teacup, glanced at his (<font color='blue'><b>Vernon</b></font>) watch, and added, <div class="bookquote">``I'd
better be off in a minute, Petunia. Marge's train gets in at ten.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Vernon/Uncle Vernon</b></font>)</div><p/>Harry, whose thoughts had been upstairs with the Broomstick Servicing
Kit, was brought back to earth with an unpleasant bump.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Aunt Marge?''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) blurted out. <div class="bookquote">``Sh -- she (<font color='blue'><b>Aunt</b></font>)'s not coming here, is she (<font color='blue'><b>Aunt</b></font>)?''

 (<font color='red'><b>Aunt</b></font>)</div><p/>Aunt Marge was Uncle Vernon's sister. Even though she (<font color='blue'><b>Marge</b></font>) was not a blood
relative of Harry's -LRB-whose mother had been Aunt Petunia's sister-RRB-, he (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>)
had been forced to call her (<font color='blue'><b>Aunt</b></font>) <div class="bookquote">``Aunt''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>all his (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) life. Aunt Marge lived in the
country, in a house with a large garden, where she (<font color='blue'><b>Marge</b></font>) bred bulldogs. She (<font color='blue'><b>Marge</b></font>)
didn't often stay at Privet Drive, because she (<font color='blue'><b>Marge</b></font>) couldn't bear to leave
her (<font color='blue'><b>Marge</b></font>) precious dogs, but each of her (<font color='blue'><b>Marge</b></font>) visits stood out horribly vividly in
Harry's mind.

<p/>At Dudley's fifth birthday party, Aunt Margo had whacked Harry around
the shins with her (<font color='blue'><b>Aunt</b></font>) walking stick to stop him (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) from beating Dudley at
musical statues. A few years later, she (<font color='blue'><b>Aunt</b></font>) had turned up at Christmas with
a computerized robot for Dudley and a box of dog biscuits for Harry. On
her (<font color='blue'><b>Aunt</b></font>) last visit, the year before Harry started at Hogwarts, Harry had
accidentally trodden on the tail of her (<font color='blue'><b>Aunt</b></font>) favorite dog. Ripper had chased
Harry out into the garden and up a tree, and Aunt Marge had refused to
call him (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) off until past midnight. The memory of this incident still
brought tears of laughter to Dudley's eyes.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Marge'll be here for a week,''  (<font color='red'><b>Uncle</b></font>)</div>Uncle Vernon snarled, 11 and while we're
on the subject'' -- he (<font color='blue'><b>Vernon</b></font>) pointed a fat finger threateningly at Harry -- <div class="bookquote">``we
need to get a few things straight before I go and collect her (<font color='blue'><b>Marge</b></font>).''

 (<font color='red'><b>Uncle Vernon</b></font>)</div><p/>Dudley smirked and withdrew his (<font color='blue'><b>Dudley</b></font>) gaze from the television. Watching Harry
being bullied by Uncle Vernon was Dudley's favorite form of
entertainment.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Firstly,''  (<font color='red'><b>Vernon/Uncle Vernon</b></font>)</div>growled Uncle Vernon, <div class="bookquote">``you'll keep a civil tongue in your
head when you're talking to Marge.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Vernon/Uncle Vernon</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``All right,''  (<font color='red'><b>Harry/Potter/Harry Potter</b></font>)</div>said Harry bitterly, ``if she (<font color='blue'><b>Marge</b></font>) does when she (<font color='blue'><b>Marge</b></font>)'s talking to me.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Secondly,''  (<font color='red'><b>Vernon/Uncle Vernon</b></font>)</div>said Uncle Vernon, acting as though he (<font color='blue'><b>Vernon</b></font>) had not heard Harry's
reply, <div class="bookquote">``as Marge doesn't know anything about your abnormality, I don't
want any -- any funny stuff while she (<font color='blue'><b>Marge</b></font>)'s here.

<p/>You behave yourself, got me?''

 (<font color='red'><b>Harry/Potter/Harry Potter</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I will if she (<font color='blue'><b>Marge</b></font>) does,''  (<font color='red'><b>Harry/Potter/Harry Potter</b></font>)</div>said Harry through gritted teeth.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``And thirdly,''  (<font color='red'><b>Vernon/Uncle Vernon</b></font>)</div>said Uncle Vernon, his (<font color='blue'><b>Vernon</b></font>) mean little eyes now slits in his (<font color='blue'><b>Vernon</b></font>)
great purple face, <div class="bookquote">``we've told Marge you attend St. Brutus's Secure
Center for Incurably Criminal Boys.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Vernon/Uncle Vernon</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``What?''  (<font color='red'><b>Harry/Potter/Harry Potter</b></font>)</div>Harry yelled.

<p/>``And you'll be sticking to that story, boy, or there'll be trouble, spat
Uncle Vernon.

<p/>Harry sat there, white-faced and furious, staring at Uncle Vernon,
hardly able to believe it. Aunt Marge coming for a weeklong visit -- it
was the worst birthday present the Dursleys had ever given him (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>),
including that pair of Uncle Vernon's old socks.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Well, Petunia,''  (<font color='red'><b>Vernon/Uncle Vernon</b></font>)</div>said Uncle Vernon, getting heavily to his (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) feet, <div class="bookquote">``I'll
be off to the station, then. Want to come along for the ride, Dudders?''

 (<font color='red'><b>Vernon/Uncle Vernon</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``No,''  (<font color='red'><b>Dudley</b></font>)</div>said Dudley, whose attention had returned to the television now
that Uncle Vernon had finished threatening Harry.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Duddy's got to make himself smart for his (<font color='blue'><b>Vernon</b></font>) auntie,''  (<font color='red'><b>Petunia/Aunt Petunia</b></font>)</div>said Aunt Petunia,
smoothing Dudley's thick blond hair. <div class="bookquote">``Mummy's bought him (<font color='blue'><b>Vernon</b></font>) a lovely new
bow tie.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Uncle</b></font>)</div><p/>Uncle Vernon clapped Dudley on his (<font color='blue'><b>Vernon</b></font>) porky shoulder. <div class="bookquote">``See you in a bit,
then,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Vernon</b></font>) said, and he (<font color='blue'><b>Vernon</b></font>) left the kitchen.

<p/>Harry, who had been sitting in a kind of horrified trance, had a sudden
idea. Abandoning his (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) toast, he (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) got quickly to his (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) feet and followed
Uncle Vernon to the front door.

<p/>Uncle Vernon was pulling on his (<font color='blue'><b>Vernon</b></font>) car coat.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``I'm not taking you,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Vernon</b></font>) snarled as he (<font color='blue'><b>Vernon</b></font>) turned to see Harry watching him (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>).

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Like I wanted to come,''  (<font color='red'><b>Harry/Potter/Harry Potter</b></font>)</div>said Harry coldly. <div class="bookquote">``I want to ask you
something.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Uncle</b></font>)</div><p/>Uncle Vernon eyed him (<font color='blue'><b>Vernon</b></font>) suspiciously.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Third years at Hog -- at my school are allowed to visit the village
sometimes,''  (<font color='red'><b>Harry/Potter/Harry Potter</b></font>)</div>said Harry.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``So?''  (<font color='red'><b>Vernon/Uncle Vernon</b></font>)</div>snapped Uncle Vernon, taking his (<font color='blue'><b>Vernon</b></font>) car keys from a hook next to the
door.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``I need you to sign the permission form,''  (<font color='red'><b>Harry/Potter/Harry Potter</b></font>)</div>said Harry in a rush.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``And why should I do that?''  (<font color='red'><b>Uncle</b></font>)</div>sneered Uncle Vernon.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Well,''  (<font color='red'><b>Harry/Potter/Harry Potter</b></font>)</div>said Harry, choosing his (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) words carefully, <div class="bookquote">``it'll be hard work,
pretending to Aunt Marge I go to that St. Whatsits --''

 (<font color='red'><b>Harry/Potter/Harry Potter</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``St. Brutus's Secure Center for Incurably Criminal Boys!''  (<font color='red'><b>Harry/Potter/Harry Potter</b></font>)</div>bellowed Uncle
Vernon, and Harry was pleased to hear a definite note of panic in Uncle
Vernon's voice.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Exactly,''  (<font color='red'><b>Harry/Potter/Harry Potter</b></font>)</div>said Harry, looking calmly up into Uncle Vernon's large,
purple face. <div class="bookquote">``It's a lot to remember. I'll have to make it sound
convincing, won't I? What if I accidentally let something slip?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``You'll get the stuffing knocked out of you, won't you?''  (<font color='red'><b>Vernon/Uncle Vernon</b></font>)</div>roared Uncle
Vernon, advancing on Harry with his (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) fist raised. But Harry stood his (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>)
ground.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Knocking the stuffing out of me won't make Aunt Marge forget what I
could tell her (<font color='blue'><b>Marge</b></font>),''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) said grimly.

<p/>Uncle Vernon stopped, his (<font color='blue'><b>Vernon</b></font>) fist still raised, his (<font color='blue'><b>Vernon</b></font>) face an ugly puce.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``But if you sign my permission form,''  (<font color='red'><b>Harry/Potter/Harry Potter</b></font>)</div>Harry went on quickly, <div class="bookquote">``I swear
I'll remember where I'm supposed to go to school, and I'll act like a
Mug -- like I'm normal and everything.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Harry/Potter/Harry Potter</b></font>)</div><p/>Harry could tell that Uncle Vernon was thinking it over, even if his (<font color='blue'><b>Vernon</b></font>)
teeth were bared and a vein was throbbing in his (<font color='blue'><b>Vernon</b></font>) temple.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Right,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Vernon</b></font>) snapped finally. <div class="bookquote">``I shall monitor your behavior carefully
during Marge's visit. If, at the end of it, you've toed the line and
kept to the story, I'll sign your ruddy form.''

 (<font color='red'><b>He</b></font>)</div><p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Vernon</b></font>) wheeled around, pulled open the front door, and slammed it so hard
that one of the little panes of glass at the top fell out.

<p/>Harry didn't return to the kitchen. He (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) went back upstairs to his (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>)
bedroom. If he (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) was going to act like a real Muggle, he (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>)'d better start
now. Slowly and sadly he (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) gathered up all his (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) presents and his (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) birthday
cards and hid them under the loose floorboard with his (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) homework. Then he (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>)
went to Hedwig's cage. Errol seemed to have recovered; he (<font color='blue'><b>Errol</b></font>) and Hedwig
were both asleep, heads under their wings. Harry sighed, then poked them
both awake.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Hedwig,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) said gloomily, <div class="bookquote">``you're going to have to clear off for a
week. Go with Errol. Ron'll look after you. I'll write him (<font color='blue'><b>Ron</b></font>) a note,
explaining. And don't look at me like that''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>-- Hedwig's large amber eyes
were reproachful -- <div class="bookquote">``it's not my fault. It's the only way I'll be
allowed to visit Hogsmeade with Ron and Hermione.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Hedwig</b></font>)</div><p/>Ten minutes later, Errol and Hedwig -LRB-who had a note to Ron bound to her (<font color='blue'><b>Hedwig</b></font>)
leg-RRB- soared out of the window and out of sight. Harry, now feeling
thoroughly miserable, put the empty cage away inside the wardrobe.

<p/>But Harry didn't have long to brood. In next to no time, Aunt Petunia
was shrieking up the stairs for Harry to come down and get ready to
welcome their guest.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Do something about your hair!''  (<font color='red'><b>Aunt</b></font>)</div>Aunt Petunia snapped as he (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) reached the
hall.

<p/>Harry couldn't see the point of trying to make his (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) hair lie flat. Aunt
Marge loved criticizing him (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>), so the untidier he (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) looked, the happier she (<font color='blue'><b>Marge</b></font>)
would be.

<p/>All too soon, there was a crunch of gravel outside as Uncle Vernon's car
pulled back into the driveway, then the clunk of the car doors and
footsteps on the garden path.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Get the door!''  (<font color='red'><b>Aunt</b></font>)</div>Aunt Petunia hissed at Harry.

<p/>A feeling of great gloom in his (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) stomach, Harry pulled the door open.

<p/>On the threshold stood Aunt Marge. She (<font color='blue'><b>Aunt</b></font>) was very like Uncle Vernon:
large, beefy, and purple- faced, she (<font color='blue'><b>Aunt</b></font>) even had a mustache, though not as
bushy as his (<font color='blue'><b>Vernon</b></font>). In one hand she (<font color='blue'><b>Aunt</b></font>) held an enormous suitcase, and tucked
under the other was an old and evil-tempered bulldog.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Where's my Dudders?''  (<font color='red'><b>Aunt</b></font>)</div>roared Aunt Marge. <div class="bookquote">``Where's my neffy-poo?''

 (<font color='red'><b>Dudley</b></font>)</div><p/>Dudley came waddling down the hall, his (<font color='blue'><b>Dudley</b></font>) blond hair plastered flat to his (<font color='blue'><b>Dudley</b></font>)
fat head, a bow tie just visible under his (<font color='blue'><b>Dudley</b></font>) many chins. Aunt Marge thrust
the suitcase into Harry's stomach, knocking the wind out of him (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>), seized
Dudley in a tight one-armed hug, and planted a large kiss on his (<font color='blue'><b>Dudley</b></font>) cheek.

<p/>Harry knew perfectly well that Dudley only put up with Aunt Marge's hugs
because he (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) was well paid for it, and sure enough, when they broke apart,
Dudley had a crisp twenty-pound note clutched in his (<font color='blue'><b>Dudley</b></font>) fat fist.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Petunia!''  (<font color='red'><b>Aunt</b></font>)</div>shouted Aunt Marge, striding past Harry as though he (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) was a
hat stand. Aunt Marge and Aunt Petunia kissed, or rather, Aunt Marge
bumped her (<font color='blue'><b>Marge</b></font>) large jaw against Aunt Petunia's bony cheekbone.

<p/>Uncle Vernon now came in, smiling jovially as he (<font color='blue'><b>Vernon</b></font>) shut the door.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Tea, Marge?''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Vernon</b></font>) said. <div class="bookquote">``And what will Ripper take?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Ripper can have some tea out of my saucer,''  (<font color='red'><b>Marge/Aunt Marge/MARGE</b></font>)</div>said Aunt Marge as they all
proceeded into the kitchen, leaving Harry alone in the hall with the
suitcase. But Harry wasn't complaining; any excuse not to be with Aunt
Marge was fine by him (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>), so he (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) began to heave the case upstairs into the
spare bedroom, taking as long as he (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) could.

<p/>By the time he (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) got back to the kitchen, Aunt Marge had been supplied
with tea and fruitcake, and Ripper was lapping noisily in the corner.
Harry saw Aunt Petunia wince slightly as specks of tea and drool flecked
her (<font color='blue'><b>Aunt</b></font>) clean floor. Aunt Petunia hated animals.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Who's looking after the other dogs, Marge?''  (<font color='red'><b>Uncle</b></font>)</div>Uncle Vernon asked.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Oh, I've got Colonel Fubster managing them,''  (<font color='red'><b>Aunt</b></font>)</div>boomed Aunt Marge. <div class="bookquote">``He (<font color='blue'><b>Colonel</b></font>)'s
retired now, good for him (<font color='blue'><b>Colonel</b></font>) to have something to do. But I couldn't leave
poor old Ripper. He (<font color='blue'><b>Ripper</b></font>) pines if he (<font color='blue'><b>Ripper</b></font>)'s away from me.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Ripper</b></font>)</div><p/>Ripper began to growl again as Harry sat down. This directed Aunt
Marge's attention to Harry for the first time.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``So!''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Aunt</b></font>) barked. <div class="bookquote">``Still here, are you?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Yes,''  (<font color='red'><b>Harry/Potter/Harry Potter</b></font>)</div>said Harry.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Don't you say yes' in that ungrateful tone,''  (<font color='red'><b>Aunt</b></font>)</div>Aunt Marge growled. <div class="bookquote">``It's
damn good of Vernon and Petunia to keep you. Wouldn't have done it
myself. You'd have gone straight to an orphanage if you'd been dumped on
my doorstep.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Harry/Potter/Harry Potter</b></font>)</div><p/>Harry was bursting to say that he (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>)'d rather live in an orphanage than
with the Dursleys, but the thought of the Hogsmeade form stopped him (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>). He (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>)
forced his (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) face into a painful smile.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Don't you smirk at me!''  (<font color='red'><b>Aunt</b></font>)</div>boomed Aunt Marge. <div class="bookquote">``I can see you haven't
improved since I last saw you. I hoped school would knock some manners
into you.''  (<font color='red'><b>She</b></font>)</div>She (<font color='blue'><b>Aunt</b></font>) took a large gulp of tea, wiped her (<font color='blue'><b>Aunt</b></font>) mustache, and said,
<div class="bookquote">``Where is it that you send him (<font color='blue'><b>Vernon</b></font>), again, Vernon?''

 (<font color='red'><b>She</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``St. Brutus's,''  (<font color='red'><b>Uncle</b></font>)</div>said Uncle Vernon promptly. <div class="bookquote">``It's a first-rate
institution for hopeless cases.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I see,''  (<font color='red'><b>Aunt</b></font>)</div>said Aunt Marge. <div class="bookquote">``Do they use the cane at St. Brutus's, boy?''
 (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Marge</b></font>) barked across the table.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Er --''

 (<font color='red'><b>Uncle</b></font>)</div><p/>Uncle Vernon nodded curtly behind Aunt Marge's back.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Yes,''  (<font color='red'><b>Harry/Potter/Harry Potter</b></font>)</div>said Harry. Then, feeling he (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) might as well do the thing properly,
he (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) added, <div class="bookquote">``all the time.''

 (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Excellent,''  (<font color='red'><b>Aunt</b></font>)</div>said Aunt Marge. <div class="bookquote">``I won't have this namby-pamby,
wishy-washy nonsense about not hitting people who deserve it. A good
thrashing is what's needed in ninety-nine cases out of a hundred. Have
you been beaten often?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Oh, yeah,''  (<font color='red'><b>Harry/Potter/Harry Potter</b></font>)</div>said Harry, <div class="bookquote">``loads of times.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Harry/Potter/Harry Potter</b></font>)</div><p/>Aunt Marge narrowed her (<font color='blue'><b>Marge</b></font>) eyes.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``I still don't like your tone, boy,''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Marge</b></font>) said. <div class="bookquote">``If you can speak of your
beatings in that casual way, they clearly aren't hitting you hard
enough. Petunia, I'd write if I were you. Make it clear that you approve
the use of extreme force in this boy's case.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Uncle</b></font>)</div><p/>Perhaps Uncle Vernon was worried that Harry might forget their bargain;
in any case, he (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) changed the subject abruptly.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Heard the news this morning, Marge? What about that escaped prisoner,
eh?''

 (<font color='red'><b>Aunt</b></font>)</div><p/>As Aunt Marge started to make herself at home, Harry caught himself
thinking almost longingly of life at number four without her (<font color='blue'><b>Marge</b></font>). Uncle
Vernon and Aunt Petunia usually encouraged Harry to stay out of their
way, which Harry was only too happy to do. Aunt Marge, on the other
hand, wanted Harry under her (<font color='blue'><b>Marge</b></font>) eye at all times, so that she (<font color='blue'><b>Marge</b></font>) could boom
out suggestions for his (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) improvement. She (<font color='blue'><b>Marge</b></font>) delighted in comparing Harry
with Dudley, and took huge pleasure in buying Dudley expensive presents
while glaring at Harry, as though daring him (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) to ask why he (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) hadn't got a
present too. She (<font color='blue'><b>Marge</b></font>) also kept throwing out dark hints about what made Harry
such an unsatisfactory person.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``You mustn't blame yourself for the way the boy's turned out, Vernon,''
 (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Marge</b></font>) said over lunch on the third day. <div class="bookquote">``If there's something rotten on
the inside, there's nothing anyone can do about it.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Harry/Potter/Harry Potter</b></font>)</div><p/>Harry tried to concentrate on his (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) food, but his (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) hands shook and his (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) face
was starting to burn with anger. Remember the form, he (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) told himself
Think about Hogsmeade. Don't say anything. Don't rise

<p/>Aunt Marge reached for her (<font color='blue'><b>Marge</b></font>) glass of wine.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``It's one of the basic rules of breeding,''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Marge</b></font>) said. <div class="bookquote">``You see it all the
time with dogs. If there's something wrong with the bitch, there'll be
something wrong with the pup --''

 (<font color='red'><b>Aunt</b></font>)</div><p/>At that moment, the wineglass Aunt Marge was holding exploded in her (<font color='blue'><b>Marge</b></font>)
hand. Shards of glass flew in every direction and Aunt Marge sputtered
and blinked, her (<font color='blue'><b>Marge</b></font>) great ruddy face dripping.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Marge!''  (<font color='red'><b>Aunt</b></font>)</div>squealed Aunt Petunia. <div class="bookquote">``Marge, are you all right?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Not to worry,''  (<font color='red'><b>Aunt</b></font>)</div>grunted Aunt Marge, mopping her (<font color='blue'><b>Marge</b></font>) face with her (<font color='blue'><b>Marge</b></font>) napkin.
<div class="bookquote">``Must have squeezed it too hard. Did the same thing at Colonel Fubster's
the other day. No need to fuss, Petunia, I have a very firm grip...''

 (<font color='red'><b>Aunt</b></font>)</div><p/>But Aunt Petunia and Uncle Vernon were both looking at Harry
suspiciously, so he (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) decided he (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>)'d better skip dessert and escape from the
table as soon as he (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) could.

<p/>Outside in the hall, he (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) leaned against the wall, breathing deeply It had
been a long time since he (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>)'d lost control and made something explode. He (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>)
couldn't afford to let it happen again. The Hogsmeade form wasn't the
only thing at stake -- if he (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) carried on like that, he (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>)'d be in trouble
with the Ministry of Magic.

<p/>Harry was still an underage wizard, and he (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) was forbidden by wizard law
to do magic outside school. His (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) record wasn't exactly clean either. Only
last summer he (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>)'d gotten an official warning that had stated quite
clearly that if the Ministry got wind of any more magic in Privet Drive,
Harry would face expulsion from Hogwarts.

<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) heard the Dursleys leaving the table and hurried upstairs out of the
way.

<p/>Harry got through the next three days by forcing himself to think about
his (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) Handbook of Do-It-Yourself Broomcare whenever Aunt Marge started on
him (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>). This worked quite well, though it seemed to give him (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) a glazed look,
because Aunt Marge started voicing the opinion that he (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) was mentally
subnormal.

<p/>At last, at long last, the final evening of Marge's stay arrived. Aunt
Petunia cooked a fancy dinner and Uncle Vernon uncorked several bottles
of wine. They got all the way through the soup and the salmon without a
single mention of Harry's faults; during the lemon meringue pie, Uncle
Vernon bored them A with a long talk about Grunnings, his (<font color='blue'><b>Vernon</b></font>) drill-making
company; then Aunt Petunia made coffee and Uncle Vernon brought out a
bottle of brandy.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Can I tempt you, Marge?''

 (<font color='red'><b>Aunt</b></font>)</div><p/>Aunt Marge had already had quite a lot of wine. Her (<font color='blue'><b>Marge</b></font>) huge face was very
red.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Just a small one, then,''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Marge</b></font>) chuckled. <div class="bookquote">``A bit more than that... and a
bit more... that's the ticket.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Dudley</b></font>)</div><p/>Dudley was eating his (<font color='blue'><b>Dudley</b></font>) fourth slice of pie. Aunt Petunia was sipping
coffee with her (<font color='blue'><b>Petunia</b></font>) little finger sticking out. Harry really wanted to
disappear into his (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) bedroom, but he (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) met Uncle Vernon's angry little eyes
and knew he (<font color='blue'><b>Vernon</b></font>) would have to sit it out.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Aah,''  (<font color='red'><b>Marge/Aunt Marge/MARGE</b></font>)</div>said Aunt Marge, smacking her (<font color='blue'><b>Marge</b></font>) lips and putting the empty brandy
glass back down. <div class="bookquote">``Excellent nosh, Petunia. It's normally just a fry-up
for me of an evening, with twelve dogs to look after...''  (<font color='red'><b>She</b></font>)</div>She (<font color='blue'><b>Marge</b></font>) burped
richly and patted her (<font color='blue'><b>Marge</b></font>) great tweed stomach. <div class="bookquote">``Pardon me. But I do like to
see a healthy-sized boy,''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Marge</b></font>) went on, winking at Dudley. <div class="bookquote">``You'll be a
proper-sized man, Dudders, like your father. Yes, I'll have a spot more
brandy, Vernon...''

 (<font color='red'><b>She</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Now, this one here --''

 (<font color='red'><b>She</b></font>)</div><p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>Marge</b></font>) jerked her (<font color='blue'><b>Marge</b></font>) head at Harry, who felt his (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) stomach clench. The Handbook,
he (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) thought quickly.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``This one's got a mean, runty look about him (<font color='blue'><b>Vernon</b></font>). You get that with dogs. I
had Colonel Fubster drown one last year. Ratty little thing it was-
Weak. Underbred.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Harry/Potter/Harry Potter</b></font>)</div><p/>Harry was trying to remember page twelve of his (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) book: A Charm to Cure
Reluctant Reversers. ``It all comes down to blood, as I was saying the
other day.

<p/>Bad blood will out. Now, I'm saying nothing against your family,
Petunia'' she (<font color='blue'><b>Marge</b></font>) patted Aunt Petunia's bony hand with her (<font color='blue'><b>Petunia</b></font>) shovellike one
<div class="bookquote">``but your sister was a bad egg. They turn up in the best families. Then
she (<font color='blue'><b>sister</b></font>) ran off with a wastrel and here's the result right in front of us.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Petunia</b></font>)</div><p/>Harry was staring at his (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) plate, a funny ringing in his (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) ears. Grasp your
broom firmly by the tail, he (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) thought. But he (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) couldn't remember what came
next. Aunt Marge's voice seemed to be boring into him (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) like one of Uncle
Vernon's drills.

<p/>``This Potter, 5-RRB- said Aunt Marge loudly, seizing the brandy bottle and
splashing more into her (<font color='blue'><b>Marge</b></font>) glass and over the tablecloth, <div class="bookquote">``you never told
me what he (<font color='blue'><b>Potter</b></font>) did?''

 (<font color='red'><b>Uncle</b></font>)</div><p/>Uncle Vernon and Aunt Petunia were looking extremely tense. Dudley had
even looked up from his (<font color='blue'><b>Dudley</b></font>) pie to gape at his (<font color='blue'><b>Dudley</b></font>) parents.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``He (<font color='blue'><b>Potter</b></font>) -- didn't work,''  (<font color='red'><b>Vernon/Uncle Vernon</b></font>)</div>said Uncle Vernon, with half a glance at Harry.
<div class="bookquote">``Unemployed.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``As I expected!''  (<font color='red'><b>Marge/Aunt Marge/MARGE</b></font>)</div>said Aunt Marge, taking a huge swig of brandy and
wiping her (<font color='blue'><b>Marge</b></font>) chin on her (<font color='blue'><b>Marge</b></font>) sleeve. <div class="bookquote">``A no-account, good-for-nothing, lazy
scrounger who --''

 (<font color='red'><b>Harry/Potter/Harry Potter</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``He (<font color='blue'><b>Potter</b></font>) was not,''  (<font color='red'><b>Harry/Potter/Harry Potter</b></font>)</div>said Harry suddenly. The table went very quiet. Harry was
shaking all over. He (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) had never felt so angry in his (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) life.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``MORE BRANDY!''  (<font color='red'><b>Uncle</b></font>)</div>yelled Uncle Vernon, who had gone very white. He (<font color='blue'><b>Vernon</b></font>) emptied
the bottle into Aunt Marge's glass. <div class="bookquote">``You, boy,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Vernon</b></font>) snarled at Harry. <div class="bookquote">``Go
to bed, go on --''

 (<font color='red'><b>Aunt</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``No, Vernon,''  (<font color='red'><b>Aunt</b></font>)</div>hiccuped Aunt Marge, holding up a hand, her (<font color='blue'><b>Marge</b></font>) tiny bloodshot
eyes fixed on Harry's. <div class="bookquote">``Go on, boy, go on. Proud of your parents, are
you? They go and get themselves killed in a car crash -LRB-drunk, I expect-RRB-
--''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``They didn't die in a car crash!''  (<font color='red'><b>Harry/Potter/Harry Potter</b></font>)</div>said Harry, who found himself on his (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>)
feet.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``They died in a car crash, you nasty little liar, and left you to be a
burden on their decent, hardworking relatives!''  (<font color='red'><b>Aunt</b></font>)</div>screamed Aunt Marge,
swelling with fury. <div class="bookquote">``You are an insolent, ungrateful little --''

 (<font color='red'><b>Aunt</b></font>)</div><p/>But Aunt Marge suddenly stopped speaking. For a moment, it looked as
though words had failed her (<font color='blue'><b>Marge</b></font>). She (<font color='blue'><b>Marge</b></font>) seemed to be swelling with
inexpressible anger -- but the swelling didn't stop. Her (<font color='blue'><b>Marge</b></font>) great red face
started to expand, her (<font color='blue'><b>Marge</b></font>) tiny eyes bulged, and her (<font color='blue'><b>Marge</b></font>) mouth stretched too
tightly for speech -- next second, several buttons had just burst from
her (<font color='blue'><b>Marge</b></font>) tweed jacket and pinged off the walls -- she (<font color='blue'><b>Marge</b></font>) was inflating like a
monstrous balloon, her (<font color='blue'><b>Marge</b></font>) stomach bursting free of her (<font color='blue'><b>Marge</b></font>) tweed waistband,
each of her (<font color='blue'><b>Marge</b></font>) fingers blowing up like a salami --

<p/><div class="bookquote">``MARGE!''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>yelled Uncle Vernon and Aunt Petunia together as Aunt Marge's
whole body began to rise off her (<font color='blue'><b>Aunt</b></font>) chair toward the ceiling. She (<font color='blue'><b>Aunt</b></font>) was
entirely round, now, like a vast life buoy with piggy eyes, and her (<font color='blue'><b>Aunt</b></font>)
hands and feet stuck out weirdly as she (<font color='blue'><b>Aunt</b></font>) drifted up into the air, making
apoplectic popping noises. Ripper came skidding into the room, barking
madly.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``NOOOOOOO!''

 (<font color='red'><b>Uncle</b></font>)</div><p/>Uncle Vernon seized one of Marge's feet and tried to pull her (<font color='blue'><b>Marge</b></font>) down
again, but was almost lifted from the floor himself. A second later,
Ripper leapt forward and sank his (<font color='blue'><b>Ripper</b></font>) teeth into Uncle Vernon's leg.

<p/>Harry tore from the dining room before anyone could stop him (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>), heading
for the cupboard under the stairs. The cupboard door burst magically
open as he (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) reached it. In seconds, he (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) had heaved his (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) trunk to the front
door. He (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) sprinted upstairs and threw himself under the bed, wrenching up
the loose floorboard, and grabbed the pillowcase full of his (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) books and
birthday presents. He (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) wriggled out, seized Hedwig's empty cage, and
dashed back downstairs to his (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) trunk, just as Uncle Vernon burst out of
the dining room, his (<font color='blue'><b>Vernon</b></font>) trouser leg in bloody tatters.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``COME BACK IN HERE!''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Vernon</b></font>) bellowed. <div class="bookquote">``COME BACK AND PUT HER RIGHT!''

 (<font color='red'><b>Harry/Potter/Harry Potter</b></font>)</div><p/>But a reckless rage had come over Harry. He (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) kicked his (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) trunk open,
pulled out his (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) wand, and pointed it at Uncle Vernon.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``She (<font color='blue'><b>They</b></font>) deserved it,''  (<font color='red'><b>Harry/Potter/Harry Potter</b></font>)</div>Harry said, breathing very fast. <div class="bookquote">``She (<font color='blue'><b>They</b></font>) deserved what
she (<font color='blue'><b>They</b></font>) got. You keep away from me.''

 (<font color='red'><b>He</b></font>)</div><p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) fumbled behind him (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) for the latch on the door.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``I'm going,''  (<font color='red'><b>Harry/Potter/Harry Potter</b></font>)</div>Harry said. <div class="bookquote">``I've had enough.''

 (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div><p/>And in the next moment, he (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) was out in the dark, quiet street, heaving
his (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) heavy trunk behind him (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>), Hedwig's cage under his (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) arm.

<p/>CHAPTER THREE

<p/>THE KNIGHT BUS

<p/>Harry was several streets away before he (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) collapsed onto a low wall in
Magnolia Crescent, panting from the effort of dragging his (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) trunk. He (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) sat
quite still, anger still surging through him (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>), listening to the frantic
thumping of his (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) heart.

<p/>But after ten minutes alone in the dark street, a new emotion overtook
him (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>): panic. Whichever way he (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) looked at it, he (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) had never been in a worse
fix. He (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) was stranded, quite alone, in the dark Muggle world, with
absolutely nowhere to go. And the worst of it was, he (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) had just done
serious magic, which meant that he (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) was almost certainly expelled from
Hogwarts. He (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) had broken the Decree for the Restriction of Underage
Wizardry so badly, he (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) was surprised Ministry of Magic representatives
weren't swooping down on him (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) where he (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) sat.

<p/>Harry shivered and looked up and down Magnolia Crescent.

<p/>What, was going to happen to him (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>)? Would he (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) be arrested, or would he (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>)
simply be outlawed from the wizarding world? He (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) thought of Ron and
Hermione, and his (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) heart sank even lower. Harry was sure that, criminal
or not, Ron and Hermione would want to help him (<font color='blue'><b>Ron</b></font>) now, but they were both
abroad, and with Hedwig gone, he (<font color='blue'><b>Ron</b></font>) had no means of contacting them.

<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Ron</b></font>) didn't have any Muggle money, either. There was a little wizard gold
in the money bag at the bottom of his (<font color='blue'><b>wizard</b></font>) trunk, but the rest of the fortune
his (<font color='blue'><b>wizard</b></font>) parents had left him (<font color='blue'><b>wizard</b></font>) was stored in a vault at Gringotts Wizarding
Bank in London. He (<font color='blue'><b>wizard</b></font>)'d never be able to drag his (<font color='blue'><b>wizard</b></font>) trunk all the way to
London. Unless...

<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>wizard</b></font>) looked down at his (<font color='blue'><b>wizard</b></font>) wand, which he (<font color='blue'><b>wizard</b></font>) was still clutching in his (<font color='blue'><b>wizard</b></font>) hand. If
he (<font color='blue'><b>wizard</b></font>) was already expelled -LRB-his (<font color='blue'><b>wizard</b></font>) heart was. now thumping painfully fast-RRB-, a
bit more magic couldn't hurt. He (<font color='blue'><b>wizard</b></font>) had the Invisibility Cloak he (<font color='blue'><b>wizard</b></font>) had
inherited from his (<font color='blue'><b>wizard</b></font>) father -- what if he (<font color='blue'><b>wizard</b></font>) bewitched the trunk to make it
feather-light, tied it to his (<font color='blue'><b>wizard</b></font>) broomstick, covered himself in the cloak,
and flew to London? Then he (<font color='blue'><b>wizard</b></font>) could get the rest of his (<font color='blue'><b>wizard</b></font>) money out of his (<font color='blue'><b>wizard</b></font>)
vault and... begin his (<font color='blue'><b>wizard</b></font>) life as an outcast. It was a horrible prospect,
but he (<font color='blue'><b>wizard</b></font>) couldn't sit on this wall forever, or he (<font color='blue'><b>wizard</b></font>)'d find himself trying to
explain to Muggle police why he (<font color='blue'><b>wizard</b></font>) was out in the dead of night with a
trunkful of spellbooks and a broomstick.

<p/>Harry opened his (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) trunk again and pushed the contents aside, looking for
the Invisibility Cloak - but before he (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) had found it, he (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) straightened up
suddenly, looking around him (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) once more.

<p/>A funny prickling on the back of his (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) neck had made Harry feel he (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) was
being watched, but the street appeared to be deserted, and no lights
shone from any of the large square houses.

<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) bent over his (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) trunk again, but almost immediately stood up once more,
his (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) hand clenched on his (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) wand. He (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) had sensed rather than heard it:
someone or something was standing in the narrow gap between the garage
and the fence behind him (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>). Harry squinted at the black alleyway. If only
it would move, then he (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>)'d know whether it was just a stray cat or --
something else.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Lumos,''  (<font color='red'><b>Harry/Potter/Harry Potter</b></font>)</div>Harry muttered, and a light appeared at the end of his (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) wand,
almost dazzling him (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>). He (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) held it high over his (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) head, and the
pebble-dashed walls of number two suddenly sparkled; the garage door
gleamed, and between them Harry saw, quite distinctly, the hulking
outline of something very big, with wide, gleaming eyes.

<p/>Harry stepped backward. His (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) legs hit his (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) trunk and he (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) tripped. His (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) wand
flew out of his (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) hand as he (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) flung out an arm to break his (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) fall, and he (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>)
landed, hard, in the gutter --

<p/>There was a deafening BANG, and Harry threw up his (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) hands to shield his (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>)
eyes against a sudden blinding light --

<p/>With a yell, he (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) rolled back onto the pavement, just in time. A second
later, a gigantic pair of wheels and headlights screeched to a halt
exactly where Harry had just been lying. They belonged, as Harry saw
when he (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) raised his (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) head, to a triple-decker, violently purple bus, which
had appeared out of thin air. Gold lettering over the windshield spelled
The Knight Bus.

<p/>For a Split second, Harry wondered if he (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) had been knocked silly by his (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>)
fall. Then a conductor in a purple uniform leapt out of the bus and
began to speak loudly to the night.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Welcome to the Knight Bus, emergency transport for the stranded witch
or wizard. just stick out your wand hand, step on board-RRB- and we can take
you anywhere you want to go. My name is Stan Shunpike, and I will be
your conductor this eve --''

 (<font color='red'><b>The conductor</b></font>)</div><p/>The conductor stopped abruptly. He (<font color='blue'><b>conductor</b></font>) had just caught sight of ``Harry, who
was still sitting on the ground. Harry snatched up his (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) wand again and
scrambled to his (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) feet. Close up, he (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) saw that Stan Shunpike was only a
few years older than he (<font color='blue'><b>Shunpike</b></font>) was, eighteen or nineteen at most, with large,
protruding ears and quite a few pimples.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``What were you doin' down there?''  (<font color='red'><b>Stan/Stan Shunpike</b></font>)</div>said Stan, dropping his (<font color='blue'><b>Stan</b></font>) professional
manner.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Fell over,''  (<font color='red'><b>Harry/Potter/Harry Potter</b></font>)</div>said Harry.

<p/><div class="bookquote">''`Choo fall over for?''  (<font color='red'><b>Harry/Potter/Harry Potter</b></font>)</div>sniggered Stan.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``I didn't do it on purpose,''  (<font color='red'><b>Harry/Potter/Harry Potter</b></font>)</div>said Harry, annoyed. One of the knees in
his (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) jeans was torn, and the hand he (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) had thrown out to break his (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) fall was
bleeding. He (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) suddenly remembered why he (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) had fallen over and turned
around quickly to stare at the alleyway between the garage and fence.
The Knight Bus's headlamps were flooding it with light, and it was
empty.

<p/><div class="bookquote">''`Choo lookin' at?''  (<font color='red'><b>Knight</b></font>)</div>said Stan.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``There was a big black thing,''  (<font color='red'><b>Harry/Potter/Harry Potter</b></font>)</div>said Harry, pointing uncertainly into the
gap. <div class="bookquote">``Like a dog... but massive...''

 (<font color='red'><b>He</b></font>)</div><p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) looked a-round at Stan, whose mouth was slightly open. With a feeling
of unease, Harry saw Stan's eyes move to the scar on Harry's forehead.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Woss that on your `ead?''  (<font color='red'><b>Stan/Stan Shunpike</b></font>)</div>said Stan abruptly.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Nothing,''  (<font color='red'><b>Harry/Potter/Harry Potter</b></font>)</div>said Harry quickly, flattening his (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) hair over his (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) scar. If the
Ministry of Magic was looking for him (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>), he (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) didn't want to make it too
easy for them.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Woss your name?''  (<font color='red'><b>Stan/Stan Shunpike</b></font>)</div>Stan persisted.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Neville Longbottom,''  (<font color='red'><b>Harry/Potter/Harry Potter</b></font>)</div>said Harry, saying the first name that came into
his (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) head. <div class="bookquote">``So -- so this bus,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) went on quickly, hoping to distract
Stan, <div class="bookquote">``did you say it goes anywhere?''

 (<font color='red'><b>Stan/Stan Shunpike</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Yep,''  (<font color='red'><b>Stan/Stan Shunpike</b></font>)</div>said Stan proudly, <div class="bookquote">``anywhere you like, long's it's on land. Can't
do nuffink underwater. `Ere,''  (<font color='red'><b>Stan/Stan Shunpike</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Stan</b></font>) said, looking suspicious again, ,You
did flag us down, dincha? Stuck out your wand `and, dincha?''

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Yes,''  (<font color='red'><b>Harry/Potter/Harry Potter</b></font>)</div>said Harry quickly. <div class="bookquote">``Listen, how much would it be to get to
London?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Eleven Sickles,''  (<font color='red'><b>Stan/Stan Shunpike</b></font>)</div>said Stan, <div class="bookquote">``but for fifteen you get `or chocolate, and
for fifteen you get an `ot water bottle an' a toofbrush in the color of
your choice.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Stan/Stan Shunpike</b></font>)</div><p/>Harry rummaged once more in his (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) trunk, extracted his (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) money bag, and
shoved some gold into Stan's hand. He (<font color='blue'><b>Stan</b></font>) and Stan then lifted his (<font color='blue'><b>Stan</b></font>) trunk,
with Hedwig's cage balanced on top, up the steps of the bus.

<p/>There were no seats; instead, half a dozen brass bedsteads stood beside
the curtained windows. Candles were burning in brackets beside each bed,
illuminating the wood-paneled walls. A tiny wizard in a nightcap at the
rear of the bus muttered, <div class="bookquote">``Not now, thanks, I'm pickling some slugs''  (<font color='red'><b>A wizard</b></font>)</div>and
rolled over in his (<font color='blue'><b>wizard</b></font>) sleep.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``You `ave this one,''  (<font color='red'><b>Stan/Stan Shunpike</b></font>)</div>Stan whispered, shoving Harry's trunk under the bed
right behind the driver, who was sitting in an armchair in front of the
steering wheel. <div class="bookquote">``This is our driver, Ernie Prang. This ,is Neville
Longbottom, Ern. ''

 (<font color='red'><b>Ernie/Ernie Prang</b></font>)</div><p/>Ernie Prang, an elderly wizard wearing very thick glasses, nodded to
Harry, who nervously flattened his (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) bangs again and sat down on his (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) bed.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Take `er away, Ern,''  (<font color='red'><b>Stan/Stan Shunpike</b></font>)</div>said Stan, sitting down in the armchair next to
Ernie's.

<p/>There was another tremendous BANG, and the next moment Harry found
himself flat on his (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) bed, thrown backward by the speed of the Knight Bus.
Pulling himself up, Harry stared out of the dark window and saw that
they were now bowling along a completely different street. Stan was
watching Harry's stunned face with great enjoyment.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``This is where we was before you flagged us down,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Stan</b></font>) said. <div class="bookquote">``Where are
we, Ern? Somewhere in Wales?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Ar,''  (<font color='red'><b>Ernie/Ernie Prang</b></font>)</div>said Ernie.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``How come the Muggles don't hear the bus?''  (<font color='red'><b>Harry/Potter/Harry Potter</b></font>)</div>said Harry.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Them!''  (<font color='red'><b>Stan/Stan Shunpike</b></font>)</div>said Stan contemptuously. <div class="bookquote">``Don' listen properly, do they? Don'
look properly either. Never notice nuffink, they don'.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Best go wake up Madam Marsh, Stan,''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>said Ern. <div class="bookquote">``We'll be in Abergavenny
in a minute.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Stan/Stan Shunpike</b></font>)</div><p/>Stan passed Harry's bed and disappeared up a narrow wooden staircase.
Harry was still looking out of the window, feeling increasingly nervous.
Ernie didn't seem to have mastered the use of a steering wheel. The
Knight Bus kept mounting the pavement, but it didn't hit anything; lines
of lampposts, mailboxes, and trash cans jumped out of its way as it
approached and back into position once it had passed.

<p/>Stan came back downstairs, followed by a faintly green witch wrapped in
a traveling cloak.

<p/><div class="bookquote">''`Ere you go, Madam Marsh,''  (<font color='red'><b>a witch</b></font>)</div>said Stan happily as Ern stamped on the
brake and the beds slid a foot or so toward the front of the bus. Madam
Marsh clamped a handkerchief to her (<font color='blue'><b>Marsh</b></font>) mouth and tottered down the steps.
Stan threw her (<font color='blue'><b>Marsh</b></font>) bag out after her (<font color='blue'><b>Marsh</b></font>) and rammed the doors shut; there was
another loud BANG, and they were thundering down a narrow country lane,
trees leaping out of the way.

<p/>Harry wouldn't have been able to sleep even if he (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) had been traveling on
a bus that didn't keep banging loudly and jumping a hundred miles at a
time. His (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) stomach churned as he (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) fell back to wondering what was going to
happen to him (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>), and whether the Dursleys had managed to get Aunt Marge
off the ceiling yet.

<p/>Stan had unfurled a copy of the Daily Prophet and was now reading with
his (<font color='blue'><b>Stan</b></font>) tongue between his (<font color='blue'><b>Stan</b></font>) teeth. A large photograph of a sunken-faced man
with long, matted hair blinked slowly at Harry from the front page. He (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>)
looked strangely familiar.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``That man!''  (<font color='red'><b>Harry/Potter/Harry Potter</b></font>)</div>Harry said, forgetting his (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) troubles for a moment. <div class="bookquote">``He (<font color='blue'><b>Stan</b></font>) was on
the Muggle news!''

 (<font color='red'><b>Stanley</b></font>)</div><p/>Stanley turned to the front page and chuckled.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Sirius Black,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) said, nodding. <div class="bookquote">''`Course 'e was on the Muggle news,
Neville, where you been?''

 (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div><p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Neville</b></font>) gave a superior sort of chuckle at the blank look on Harry's face,
removed the front page, and handed it to Harry.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``You oughta read the papers more, Neville.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Harry/Potter/Harry Potter</b></font>)</div><p/>Harry held the paper up to the candlelight and read:

<p/>BLACK STILL AT LARGE

<p/>Sirius Black, possibly the most infamous prisoner ever to be held in
Azkaban fortress, is still eluding capture, the Ministry of Magic
confirmed today.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``We are doing all we can to recapture Black,''  (<font color='red'><b>the Minister Fudge morning</b></font>)</div>said the Minister of
Magic, Cornelius Fudge, this morning, <div class="bookquote">``and we beg the magical community
to remain calm.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Cornelius Fudge/Fudge/Cornelius</b></font>)</div><p/>Fudge has been criticized by some members of the International
Federation of Warlocks for informing the Muggle Prime Minister of the
crisis.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Well, really, I had to, don't you know,''  (<font color='red'><b>an Fudge</b></font>)</div>said an irritable Fudge.
<div class="bookquote">``Black is mad. He (<font color='blue'><b>Black</b></font>)'s a danger to anyone who crosses him (<font color='blue'><b>Black</b></font>), magic or Muggle.
I have the Prime Minister's assurance that he (<font color='blue'><b>Minister</b></font>) will not breathe a word of
Black's true identity to anyone. And let's face it-who'd believe him (<font color='blue'><b>Black</b></font>) if
he (<font color='blue'><b>Black</b></font>) did?''

 (<font color='red'><b>Muggles</b></font>)</div><p/>While Muggles have been told that Black is carrying a gun -LRB-a kind of
metal wand that Muggles use to kill each other-RRB-, the magical community
lives in fear of a massacre like that of twelve years ago, when Black
murdered thirteen people with a single curse.

<p/>Harry looked into the shadowed eyes of Sirius Black, the only part of
the sunken face that seemed alive. Harry had never met a vampire, but he (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>)
had seen pictures of them in his (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) Defense Against the Dark Arts classes,
and Black, with his (<font color='blue'><b>Black</b></font>) waxy white skin, looked just like one.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Scary-lookin' fing, inee?''  (<font color='red'><b>Stan/Stan Shunpike</b></font>)</div>said Stan, who had been watching Harry read.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``He (<font color='blue'><b>Black</b></font>) murdered thirteen people?''  (<font color='red'><b>Harry/Potter/Harry Potter</b></font>)</div>said Harry, handing the page back to
Stan, <div class="bookquote">``with one curse?''

 (<font color='red'><b>Stan/Stan Shunpike</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Yep,''  (<font color='red'><b>Stan/Stan Shunpike</b></font>)</div>said Stan, <div class="bookquote">``in front of witnesses an' all. Broad daylight. Big
trouble it caused, dinnit, Ern?''

 (<font color='red'><b>Stan/Stan Shunpike</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Ar,''  (<font color='red'><b>Stan/Stan Shunpike</b></font>)</div>said Ern darkly.

<p/>Stan swiveled in his (<font color='blue'><b>Stan</b></font>) armchair, his (<font color='blue'><b>Stan</b></font>) hands on the back, the better to look
at Harry.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Black woz a big supporter of You-Know-`Oo,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) said.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``What, Voldemort?''  (<font color='red'><b>Harry/Potter/Harry Potter</b></font>)</div>said Harry, without thinking.

<p/>Even Stan's pimples went white; Ern jerked the steering wheel so hard
that a whole farmhouse had to jump aside to avoid the bus.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``You outta your tree?''  (<font color='red'><b>Stan/Stan Shunpike</b></font>)</div>yelped Stan. <div class="bookquote">''`Choo say `is name for?''

 (<font color='red'><b>Stan/Stan Shunpike</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Sorry,''  (<font color='red'><b>Harry/Potter/Harry Potter</b></font>)</div>said Harry hastily. <div class="bookquote">``Sorry, I -- I forgot --''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Forgot!''  (<font color='red'><b>Stan/Stan Shunpike</b></font>)</div>said Stan weakly. <div class="bookquote">``Blimey, my `eart's goin' that fast ...''

 (<font color='red'><b>Harry/Potter/Harry Potter</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``So -- so Black was a supporter of You-Know-Who?''  (<font color='red'><b>Harry/Potter/Harry Potter</b></font>)</div>Harry prompted
apologetically.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Yeah,''  (<font color='red'><b>Stan/Stan Shunpike</b></font>)</div>said Stan, still rubbing his (<font color='blue'><b>Stan</b></font>) chest. ``Yeah, that's right. Very
close to You-Know-``Oo, they say. Anyway, when little ``Arry Potter got
the better of You-Know-<div class="bookquote">``Oo --''

 (<font color='red'><b>Harry/Potter/Harry Potter</b></font>)</div><p/>Harry nervously flattened his (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) bangs down again.

<p/>''-- all You-Know-``Oo's supporters was tracked down, wasn't they, Ern?
Most of 'em knew it was all over, wiv You-Know-``Oo gone, and they came
quiet. But not Sirius Black. I `eard he (<font color='blue'><b>Black</b></font>) thought `e'd be
second-in-command once You-Know-``Oo `ad taken over.

<p/>``Anyway, they cornered Black in the middle of a street full of Muggles
an' Black took out `is wand and 'e blasted `alf the street apart, an' a
wizard got it, an' so did a dozen Muggles what got in the way. <div class="bookquote">``Orrible,
eh? An' you know what Black did then?''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>Stan continued in a dramatic
whisper.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``What?''  (<font color='red'><b>Harry/Potter/Harry Potter</b></font>)</div>said Harry.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Laughed,''  (<font color='red'><b>Stan/Stan Shunpike</b></font>)</div>said Stan. ``Jus' stood there an' laughed. An' when
reinforcements from the Ministry of Magic got there, I 'e went wiv em
quiet as anyfink, still laughing `is `ead off. <div class="bookquote">``Cos `e's mad, inee, Ern?
Inee mad?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``If he (<font color='blue'><b>Black</b></font>) weren't when he (<font color='blue'><b>Black</b></font>) went to Azkaban, he (<font color='blue'><b>Black</b></font>) will be now,''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>said Ern in his (<font color='blue'><b>Stan</b></font>)
slow voice. <div class="bookquote">``I'd blow meself up before I set foot in that place. Serves
him (<font color='blue'><b>Black</b></font>) right, mind you ... after what he (<font color='blue'><b>Black</b></font>) did...''

 (<font color='red'><b>Stan/Stan Shunpike</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``They `ad a job coverin' it up, din' they, Ern?''  (<font color='red'><b>Stan/Stan Shunpike</b></font>)</div>Stan said. <div class="bookquote">''`Ole street
blown up an' all them Muggles dead. What was it they said ad `appened,
Ern?''

 (<font color='red'><b>Stan/Stan Shunpike</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Gas explosion,''  (<font color='red'><b>Ernie/Ernie Prang</b></font>)</div>grunted Ernie.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``An' now `e's out,''  (<font color='red'><b>Stan/Stan Shunpike</b></font>)</div>said Stan, examining the newspaper picture of
Black's gaunt face again. <div class="bookquote">``Never been a breakout from Azkaban before,
`as there, Ern? Beats me `ow 'e did it. Frightenin', eh? Mind, I don't
fancy `is chances against them Azkaban guards, eh, Ern?''

 (<font color='red'><b>Ernie/Ernie Prang</b></font>)</div><p/>Ernie suddenly shivered.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Talk about summat else, Stan, there's a good lad. Them Azkaban guards
give me the collywobbles.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Stan/Stan Shunpike</b></font>)</div><p/>Stan put the paper away reluctantly, and Harry leaned against the window
of the Knight Bus, feeling worse than ever. He (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) couldn't help imagining
what Stan might be telling his (<font color='blue'><b>Stan</b></font>) passengers in a few nights' time.

<p/>''`Ear about that ``Arry Potter? Blew up `is aunt! We `ad `im `ere on the
Knight Bus, di'n't we, Ern? <div class="bookquote">``E was tryin' I to run for it...''

 (<font color='red'><b>He</b></font>)</div><p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Stan</b></font>), Harry, had broken wizard law just like Sirius Black. Was inflating
Aunt Marge bad enough to land him (<font color='blue'><b>Black</b></font>) in Azkaban? Harry didn't know anything
about the wizard prison, though everyone he (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>)'d ever heard speak of it did
so in the same fearful tone. Hagrid, the Hogwarts gamekeeper, had spent
two months there only last year. Harry wouldn't soon forget the look of
terror on Hagrid's face when he (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) had been told where he (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) was going, and
Hagrid was one of the bravest people Harry knew.

<p/>The Knight Bus rolled through the darkness, scattering bushes and
wastebaskets, telephone booths and trees, and Harry lay, restless and
miserable, on his (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) feather bed. After a while, Stan remembered that Harry
had paid for hot chocolate, but poured it all over Harry's pillow when
the bus moved abruptly from Anglesea to Aberdeen. One by one, wizards
and witches in dressing gowns and slippers descended from the upper
floors to leave the bus. They all looked very pleased to go.

<p/>Finally, Harry was the only passenger left.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Right then, Neville,''  (<font color='red'><b>Stan/Stan Shunpike</b></font>)</div>said Stan, clapping his (<font color='blue'><b>Stan</b></font>) hands, where abouts in
London?''

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Diagon Alley,''  (<font color='red'><b>Harry/Potter/Harry Potter</b></font>)</div>said Harry.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Righto,''  (<font color='red'><b>Stan/Stan Shunpike</b></font>)</div>said Stan. <div class="bookquote">''`Old tight, then.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Stan/Stan Shunpike</b></font>)</div><p/>BANG.

<p/>They were thundering along Charing Cross Road. Harry sat up and watched
buildings and benches squeezing themselves out of the Knight Bus's way.
The sky was getting a little lighter. He (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) would lie low for a couple of
hours, go to Gringotts the. moment it opened, then set off -- where, he (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>)
didn't know.

<p/>Ern slammed on the brakes and the Knight Bus skidded to a halt in front
of a small and shabby- looking pub, the Leaky Cauldron, behind which lay
the magical entrance to Diagon Alley.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Thanks,''  (<font color='red'><b>Harry/Potter/Harry Potter</b></font>)</div>Harry said to Ern.

<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) jumped down the steps and helped Stan lower his (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) trunk and Hedwig's
cage onto the pavement.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Well,''  (<font color='red'><b>Harry/Potter/Harry Potter</b></font>)</div>said Harry. <div class="bookquote">''`Bye then!''

 (<font color='red'><b>Harry/Potter/Harry Potter</b></font>)</div><p/>But Stan wasn't paying attention. Still standing in the doorway to the
bus-RRB- he (<font color='blue'><b>Stan</b></font>) was goggling at the shadowy entrance to the Leaky Cauldron.
<div class="bookquote">``There you are, Harry,''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>said a voice.

<p/>Before Harry could turn, he (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) felt a hand on his (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) shoulder. At the same
time, Stan shouted, <div class="bookquote">``Blimey! Ern, come `ere! Come `ere I''

 (<font color='red'><b>Stan/Stan Shunpike</b></font>)</div><p/>Harry looked up at the owner of the hand on his (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) shoulder and felt a
bucketful of ice cascade into his (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) stomach -- he (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) had walked right into
Cornelius Fudge, the Minister of Magic himself.

<p/>Stan leapt onto the pavement beside them.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``What didja call Neville, Minister?''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Stan</b></font>) said excitedly.

<p/>Fudge, a portly little man in a long, pinstriped cloak, looked cold and
exhausted.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Neville?''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Stan</b></font>) repeated, frowning. <div class="bookquote">``This is Harry Potter.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I knew it!''  (<font color='red'><b>Stan/Stan Shunpike</b></font>)</div>Stan shouted gleefully. ``Ern! Ern! Guess `oo Neville is,
Ern! ``E's <div class="bookquote">``Arry Potter! I can see `is scar!''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Yes,''  (<font color='red'><b>Fudge</b></font>)</div>said Fudge testily, <div class="bookquote">``well, I'm very glad the Knight Bus picked
Harry up, but he (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) and I need to step inside the Leaky Cauldron now...''

 (<font color='red'><b>Fudge</b></font>)</div><p/>Fudge increased the pressure on Harry's shoulder, and Harry found
himself being steered inside the pub. A stooping figure bearing a
lantern appeared through the door behind the bar. It was Tom, the
wizened, toothless landlord.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``You've got him (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>), Minister!''  (<font color='red'><b>Tom</b></font>)</div>said Tom. <div class="bookquote">``Will you be wanting anything?
Beer? Brandy?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Perhaps a pot of tea,''  (<font color='red'><b>Fudge</b></font>)</div>said Fudge, who still hadn't let go of Harry.

<p/>There was a loud scraping and puffing from behind them, and Stan and Ern
appeared, carrying Harry's trunk and Hedwig's cage and looking around
excitedly.

<p/><div class="bookquote">''`Ow come you di'n't tell us `oo you are, eh, Neville?''  (<font color='red'><b>Hedwig</b></font>)</div>said Stan,
beaming at Harry, while Ernie's owlish face peered interestedly over
Stan's shoulder.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``And a private parlor, please, Tom,''  (<font color='red'><b>Fudge</b></font>)</div>said Fudge pointedly.

<p/>`Bye,'' Harry said miserably to Stan and Ern as Tom beckoned Fudge toward
the passage that led from the bar.

<p/><div class="bookquote">''`Bye, Neville!''  (<font color='red'><b>Bye</b></font>)</div>called Stan.

<p/>Fudge marched Harry along the narrow passage after Tom's lantern, and
then into a small parlor. Tom clicked his (<font color='blue'><b>Tom</b></font>) fingers, a fire burst into
life in the grate, and he (<font color='blue'><b>Tom</b></font>) bowed himself out of the room.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Sit down, Harry,''  (<font color='red'><b>Fudge</b></font>)</div>said Fudge, indicating a chair by the fire.

<p/>Harry sat down, feeling goose bumps rising up his (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) arms despite the glow
of the fire. Fudge took off his (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) pinstriped cloak and tossed it aside,
then hitched up the trousers of his (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) bottle-green suit and sat down
opposite Harry.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``I am Cornelius Fudge, Harry. The Minister of Magic.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Harry/Potter/Harry Potter</b></font>)</div><p/>Harry already knew this, of course; he (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) had seen Fudge once before, but
as he (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) had been wearing his (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) father's Invisibility Cloak at the time,
Fudge wasn't to know that.

<p/>Tom the innkeeper reappeared, wearing an apron over his (<font color='blue'><b>Tom</b></font>) nightshirt and
bearing a tray of tea and crumpets. He (<font color='blue'><b>Tom</b></font>) placed the tray on a table
between Fudge and Harry and left the parlor, closing the door behind
him (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>).

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Well, Harry,''  (<font color='red'><b>Fudge</b></font>)</div>said Fudge, pouring out tea, <div class="bookquote">``you've had us all in a
right flap, I don't mind telling you. Running away from your aunt and
uncle's house like that! I'd started to think... but you're safe, and
that's what matters.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Fudge</b></font>)</div><p/>Fudge buttered himself a crumpet and pushed the plate toward Harry.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Eat, Harry, you look dead on your feet. Now then... You will be pleased
to hear that we have dealt with the unfortunate blowing-up of Miss
Marjorie Dursley. Two members of the Accidental Magic Reversal
Department were dispatched to Privet Drive a few hours ago. Miss Dursley
has been punctured and her (<font color='blue'><b>Marjorie</b></font>) memory has been modified. She (<font color='blue'><b>Marjorie</b></font>) has no
recollection of the incident at all. So that's that, and no harm done.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Fudge</b></font>)</div><p/>Fudge smiled at Harry over the rim of his (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) teacup, rather like an uncle
surveying a favorite nephew. Harry, who couldn't believe his (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) ears,
opened his (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) mouth to speak, couldn't think of anything to say, and closed
it again.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Ah, you're worrying about the reaction of your aunt and uncle?''  (<font color='red'><b>Fudge</b></font>)</div>said
Fudge. <div class="bookquote">``Well, I won't deny that they are extremely angry, Harry, but
they are prepared to take you back next summer as long as you stay at
Hogwarts for the Christmas and Easter holidays.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Harry/Potter/Harry Potter</b></font>)</div><p/>Harry unstuck his (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) throat.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``I always stay at Hogwarts for the Christmas and Easter holidays,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>)
said, <div class="bookquote">``and I don't ever want to go back to Privet Drive.''

 (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Now, now, I'm sure you'll feel differently once you've calmed down,''
 (<font color='red'><b>Fudge</b></font>)</div>said Fudge in a worried tone. <div class="bookquote">``They are your family, after all, and I'm
sure you are fond of each other -- er -- very deep down.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Harry/Potter/Harry Potter</b></font>)</div><p/>It didn't occur to Harry to put Fudge right. He (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) was still waiting to
hear what was going to happen to him (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) now.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``So all that remains,''  (<font color='red'><b>Cornelius Fudge/Fudge/Cornelius</b></font>)</div>said Fudge, now buttering himself a second
crumpet, ``is to decide where you're going to spend the last two weeks of
your vacation. I suggest you take a room here at the Leaky Cauldron and

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Hang on,''  (<font color='red'><b>Harry/Potter/Harry Potter</b></font>)</div>blurted Harry. <div class="bookquote">``What about my punishment?''

 (<font color='red'><b>Fudge</b></font>)</div><p/>Fudge blinked. <div class="bookquote">``Punishment?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I broke the law!''  (<font color='red'><b>Harry/Potter/Harry Potter</b></font>)</div>Harry said. <div class="bookquote">``The Decree for the Restriction of
Underage Wizardry!''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Oh, my dear boy, we're not going to punish you for a little thing like
that!''  (<font color='red'><b>Fudge</b></font>)</div>cried Fudge, waving his (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) crumpet impatiently. <div class="bookquote">``It was an accident!
We don't send people to Azkaban just for blowing up their aunts!''

 (<font color='red'><b>Harry/Potter/Harry Potter</b></font>)</div><p/>But this didn't tally at all with Harry's past dealings with the
Ministry of Magic.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Last year, I got an official warning just because a house-elf smashed a
pudding in my uncle's house!''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) told Fudge, frowning. <div class="bookquote">``The Ministry of
Magic said I'd be expelled from Hogwarts if there was any more magic
there!''

 (<font color='red'><b>Harry/Potter/Harry Potter</b></font>)</div><p/>Unless Harry's eyes were deceiving him (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>), Fudge was suddenly looking
awkward.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Circumstances change, Harry... We have to take into account... in the
present climate... Surely you don't want to be expelled?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Of course I don't,''  (<font color='red'><b>Harry/Potter/Harry Potter</b></font>)</div>said Harry.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Well then, what's A the fuss about?''  (<font color='red'><b>Fudge</b></font>)</div>laughed Fudge. <div class="bookquote">``Now, have a
crumpet, Harry, while I go and see if Tom's got a room for you.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Fudge</b></font>)</div><p/>Fudge strode out of the parlor and Harry stared after him (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>). There was
something extremely odd going on. Why had Fudge been waiting for him (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) at
the Leaky Cauldron, if not to punish him (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) for what he (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>)'d done? And now
Harry came to think of it, surely it wasn't usual for the Minister of
Magic himself to get involved in matters of underage magic?

<p/>Fudge came back, accompanied by Tom the innkeeper.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Room eleven's free, Harry,''  (<font color='red'><b>Fudge</b></font>)</div>said Fudge. <div class="bookquote">``I think you'll be very
comfortable. just one thing, and I'm sure you'll understand... I don't
want you wandering off into Muggle London, all right? Keep to Diagon
Alley. And you're to be back here before dark each night. Sure you'll
understand. Tom will be keeping an eye on you for me.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Okay,''  (<font color='red'><b>Harry/Potter/Harry Potter</b></font>)</div>said Harry slowly, <div class="bookquote">``but why?''

 (<font color='red'><b>Harry/Potter/Harry Potter</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Don't want to lose you again, do we?''  (<font color='red'><b>Fudge</b></font>)</div>said Fudge with a hearty laugh.
<div class="bookquote">``No, no... best we know where you are... I mean...''

 (<font color='red'><b>Fudge</b></font>)</div><p/>Fudge cleared his (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) throat loudly and picked up his (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) pinstriped cloak.

<p/>``Well, I'll be off, plenty to do, you know...

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Have you had any luck with Black yet?''  (<font color='red'><b>Harry/Potter/Harry Potter</b></font>)</div>Harry asked.

<p/>Fudge's finger slipped on the silver fastenings of his (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) cloak.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``What's that? Oh, you've heard -- well, no, not yet, but it's only a
matter of time. The Azkaban guards have never yet failed... and they are
angrier than I've ever seen them.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Fudge</b></font>)</div><p/>Fudge shuddered slightly.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``So, I'll say good-bye.''

 (<font color='red'><b>He</b></font>)</div><p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) held out his (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) hand and Harry, shaking it, had a sudden idea.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Er -- Minister? Can I ask you something?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Certainly,''  (<font color='red'><b>Fudge</b></font>)</div>said Fudge with a smile.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Well, third years at Hogwarts are allowed to visit Hogsmeade, but my
aunt and uncle didn't sign the permission form. D'you think you could
--?''

 (<font color='red'><b>Fudge</b></font>)</div><p/>Fudge was looking uncomfortable.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Ah,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) said. <div class="bookquote">``No, no, I'm very sorry, Harry, but as I'm not your
parent or guardian --''

 (<font color='red'><b>Harry/Potter/Harry Potter</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``But you I re the Minister of Magic,''  (<font color='red'><b>Harry/Potter/Harry Potter</b></font>)</div>said Harry eagerly. ``If you gave
me permission

<p/><div class="bookquote">``No, I'm sorry, Harry, but rules are rules,''  (<font color='red'><b>Fudge</b></font>)</div>said Fudge flatly.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Perhaps You'll be able to visit Hogsmeade next year. In fact, I think
it's best if you don't... yes... well, I'll be off Enjoy your stay,
Harry.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Harry/Potter/Harry Potter</b></font>)</div><p/>And with a last smile and shake of Harry's hand, Fudge left the room.
Tom now moved forward, beaming at Harry.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``If you'll follow me, Mr. Potter,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) said, <div class="bookquote">``I've already taken your
things up...''

 (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div><p/>Harry followed Tom up a handsome wooden staircase to a door with a brass
number eleven on it, which Tom unlocked and opened for him (<font color='blue'><b>Tom</b></font>).

<p/>Inside was a very comfortable-looking bed, some highly polished oak
furniture, a cheerfully crackling fire and, perched on top of the
wardrobe -

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Hedwig!''  (<font color='red'><b>Harry/Potter/Harry Potter</b></font>)</div>Harry gasped.

<p/>The snowy owl clicked her (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) beak and fluttered down onto Harry's arm.

<p/>``Very smart owl you've got there, chuckled Tom. <div class="bookquote">``Arrived about five
minutes after you did. If there's anything you need, Mr. Potter, don't
hesitate to ask.''

 (<font color='red'><b>He</b></font>)</div><p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) gave another bow and left.

<p/>Harry sat on his (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) bed for a long time, absentmindedly stroking Hedwig.
The sky outside the window was changing rapidly from deep, velvety blue
to cold, steely gray and then, slowly, to pink shot with gold. Harry
could hardly believe that he (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>)'d left Privet Drive only a few hours ago,
that he (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) wasn't expelled, and that he (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) was now facing two completely
Dursley-free weeks.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``It's been a very weird night, Hedwig,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) yawned.

<p/>And without even removing his (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) glasses, he (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) slumped back onto his (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) pillows
and fell asleep.

<p/>CHAPTER FOUR

<p/>THE LEAKY CAULDRON

<p/>It took Harry several days to get used to his (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) strange new freedom. Never
before had he (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) been able to get up whenever he (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) wanted or eat whatever he (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>)
fancied. He (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) could even go wherever he (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) pleased, as long as it was in
Diagon Alley, and as this long cobbled street was packed with the most
fascinating wizarding shops in the world, Harry felt no desire to break
his (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) word to Fudge and stray back into the Muggle world.

<p/>Harry ate breakfast each morning in the Leaky Cauldron, where he (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) liked
watching the other guests: funny little witches from the country, up for
a day's shopping; venerable-looking wizards arguing over the latest
article in Transfiguration Today; wild-looking warlocks; raucous dwarfs;
and once, what looked suspiciously like a hag, who ordered a plate of
raw liver from behind a thick woollen balaclava.

<p/>After breakfast Harry would go out into the backyard, take out his (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) wand,
tap the third brick from the left above the trash bit,, and stand back
as the archway into Diagon Alley opened in the wall.

<p/>Harry spent the long sunny days exploring the shops and eating under the
brightly colored umbrellas outside cafes, where his (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) fellow diners were
showing one another their purchases -LRB- <div class="bookquote">'' it , s a lunascope, old boy --
no more messing around with moon charts, see?'' (<font color='red'><b>fellow diners</b></font>)</div>-RRB- or else discussing the
case of Sirius Black -LRB-<div class="bookquote">``personalty, I won't let any of the children out
alone until he (<font color='blue'><b>Potter</b></font>)'s back in Azkaban'' (<font color='red'><b>Black/Sirius/Sirius Black</b></font>)</div>-RRB-. Harry didn't have to do his (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) homework
under the blankets by flashlight anymore; now he (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) could sit in the bright
sunshine outside Florean Fortescue's Ice Cream Parlor, finishing all his (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>)
essays with occasional help from Florean Fortescue himself, who, apart
from knowing a great deal about medieval witch burnings, gave Harry free
sundaes every half an hour.

<p/>Once Harry had refilled his (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) money bag with gold Galleons, silver
Sickles, and bronze Knuts from his (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) vault at Gringotts, he (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) had to
exercise a lot of self-control not to spend the whole lot at once. He (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>)
had to keep reminding himself that he (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) had five years to go at Hogwarts,
and how it would feel to ask the Dursleys for money for spellbooks, to
stop himself from buying a handsome set of solid gold Gobstones -LRB-a
wizarding game rather like marbles, in which the stones squirt a
nasty-smelling liquid into the other player's face when they lose a
point-RRB-. He (<font color='blue'><b>player</b></font>) was sorely tempted, too, by the perfect, moving model of the
galaxy in a large glass ball, which would have meant he (<font color='blue'><b>player</b></font>) never had to
take another Astronomy lesson. But the thing that tested Harry's
resolution most appeared in his (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) favorite shop, Quality Quidditch
Supplies, a week after he (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>)'d arrived at the Leaky Cauldron.

<p/>Curious to know what the crowd in the shop was staring at, Harry edged
his (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) way inside and squeezed in among the excited witches and wizards
until he (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) glimpsed a newly erected podium, on which was mounted the most
magnificent broom he (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) had ever seen in his (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) life.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Just come out -- prototype --''  (<font color='red'><b>a wizard</b></font>)</div>a square-jawed wizard was telling his (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>)
companion.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``It's the fastest broom in the world, isn't it, Dad?''  (<font color='red'><b>a boy</b></font>)</div>squeaked a boy
younger than Harry, who was swinging off his (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) father's arm.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Irish International Side's Just put in an order for seven of these
beauties!''  (<font color='red'><b>the proprietor</b></font>)</div>the proprietor of the shop told the crowd. <div class="bookquote">``And they're
favorites for the World Cup!''

 (<font color='red'><b>A witch</b></font>)</div><p/>A large witch in front of Harry moved, and he (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) was able to read the sign
next to the broom:

<p/>** THE FIREBOLT **

<p/>THIS STATE-OF-THE-ART PACING BROOM SPORTS A STREAM-LINED, SUPERFINE
HANDLE OF ASH, TREATED WITH A DIAMOND-HARD POLISH AND HAND- NUMBERED
WITH ITS OWN REGISTRATION NUMBER. EACH INDIVIDUALLY SELECTED BIRCH TWIG
IN THE BROOMTAIL HAS BEEN HONED TO AERODYNAMIC PERFECTION, GIVING THE
FIREBOLT UNSURPASSABLE BALANCE AND PINPOINT PRECISION. THE FIREBOLT HAS
AN ACCELERATION OF 150 MILES AN HOUR IN TEN SECONDS AND INCORPORATES AN
UNBREAKABLE BRAKING CHARM. PRICE ON REQUEST.

<p/>Price on request... Harry didn't like to think how much gold the
Firebolt would cost. He (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) had never wanted anything as much in his (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) whole
life -- but he (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) had never lost a Quidditch match on his (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) Nim bus Two
Thousand, and what was the point in emptying his (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) Gringotts vault for the
Firebolt, when he (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) had a very good broom already? Harry didn't ask for
the price, but he (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) returned, almost every day after that, just to look at
the Firebolt.

<p/>There were, however, things that Harry needed to buy. He (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) went to the
Apothecary to replenish his (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) store of potions ingredients, and as his (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>)
school robes were now several inches too short in the arm and leg, he (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>)
visited Madam Malkin's Robes for All Occasions and bought new ones. Most
important of all, he (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) had to buy his (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) new schoolbooks, which would include
those for his (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) two new subjects, Care of Magical Creatures and
Divination.

<p/>Harry got a surprise as he (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) looked in at the bookshop window. Instead of
the usual display of gold- embossed spellbooks the size of paving slabs,
there was a large iron cage behind the glass that held about a hundred
copies of The Monster Book of Monsters. Torn pages were flying
everywhere as the books grappled with each other, locked together in
furious wrestling matches and snapping aggressively.

<p/>Harry pulled his (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) booklist out of his (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) pocket and consulted it for the
first time. The Monster Book of Monsters was listed as the required book
for Care of Magical Creatures. Now Harry understood why Hagrid had said
it would come in useful. He (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) felt relieved; he (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) had been wondering whether
Hagrid wanted help with some terrifying new pet.

<p/>As Harry entered Flourish and Blotts, the manager came hurrying toward
him (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>).

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Hogwarts?''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) said abruptly. <div class="bookquote">``Come to get your new books?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Yes,''  (<font color='red'><b>Harry/Potter/Harry Potter</b></font>)</div>said Harry, <div class="bookquote">``I need --''

 (<font color='red'><b>Harry/Potter/Harry Potter</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Get out of the way,''  (<font color='red'><b>Harry/Potter/Harry Potter</b></font>)</div>said the manager impatiently, brushing Harry
aside. He (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) drew on a pair of very thick gloves, picked up a large,
knobbly walking stick, and proceeded toward the door of the Monster
Books' cage.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Hang on,''  (<font color='red'><b>Harry/Potter/Harry Potter</b></font>)</div>said Harry quickly, <div class="bookquote">``I've already got one of those.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Harry/Potter/Harry Potter</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Have you?''  (<font color='red'><b>the manager</b></font>)</div>A look of enormous relief spread over the manager's face.
<div class="bookquote">``Thank heavens for that. I've been bitten five times already this
morning --''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/>A loud ripping noise rent the air; two of the Monster Books had seized a
third and were pulling it apart.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Stop it! Stop it!''  (<font color='red'><b>the manager</b></font>)</div>cried the manager, poking the walking stick through
the bars and knocking the books apart. <div class="bookquote">``I'm never stocking them again,
never! It's been bedlam! I thought we'd seen the worst when we bought
two hundred copies of the Invisible Book of Invisibility -cost a
fortune, and we never found them... Well... is there anything else I
can help you with?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Yes,''  (<font color='red'><b>Harry/Potter/Harry Potter</b></font>)</div>said Harry, looking down his (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) booklist, <div class="bookquote">``I need Unfogging the
Future by Cassandra Vablatsky.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Harry/Potter/Harry Potter</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Ah, starting Divination, are you?''  (<font color='red'><b>the manager</b></font>)</div>said the manager, stripping off his (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>)
gloves and leading Harry into the back of the shop, where there was a
corner devoted to fortune-telling. A small table was stacked with
volumes such as Predicting the Unpredictable: Insulate Yourself Against
Shocks and Broken Balls: When Fortunes Turn Foul.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Here you are,,''  (<font color='red'><b>the manager</b></font>)</div>said the manager, who had climbed a set of steps to
take down a thick, black- bound book. ``Unfogging the Future. Very good
guide to all your basic fortune-telling methods - palmistry, crystal
balls, bird entrails.

<p/>But Harry wasn't listening. His (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) eyes had fallen on another book, which
was among a display on a small table: Death Omens.- What to Do When You
Know the Worst Is Coming.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Oh, I wouldn't read that if I were you,''  (<font color='red'><b>the manager</b></font>)</div>said the manager lightly,
looking to see what Harry was staring at. <div class="bookquote">``You'll start seeing death
omens everywhere. It's enough to frighten anyone to death. ''

 (<font color='red'><b>Harry/Potter/Harry Potter</b></font>)</div><p/>But Harry continued to stare at the front cover of the book; it showed a
black dog large as a bear, with gleaming eyes. It looked oddly
familiar...

<p/>The manager pressed Unfogging the Future into Harry's hands.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Anything else?''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) said.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Yes,''  (<font color='red'><b>Harry/Potter/Harry Potter</b></font>)</div>said Harry, tearing his (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) eyes away from the dog's and dazedly
consulting his (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) booklist. <div class="bookquote">``Er -- I need Intermediate Transfiguration and
The Standard Book of Spells, Grade Three.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Harry/Potter/Harry Potter</b></font>)</div><p/>Harry emerged from Flourish and Blotts ten minutes later with his (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) new
books under his (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) arms and made his (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) way back to the Leaky Cauldron, hardly
noticing where he (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) was going and bumping into several people.

<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) tramped up the stairs to his (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) room, went inside, and tipped his (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) books
onto his (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) bed. Somebody had been in to tidy; the windows were open and
sun was pouring inside. Harry could hear the buses rolling by in the
unseen Muggle street behind him (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) and the sound of the invisible crowd
below in Diagon Alley. He (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) caught sight of himself in the mirror over the
basin.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``It can't have been a death omen,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) told his (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) reflection defiantly. <div class="bookquote">``I
was panicking when I saw that thing in Magnolia Crescent... It was
probably just a stray dog...''

 (<font color='red'><b>He</b></font>)</div><p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) raised his (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) hand automatically and tried to make his (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) hair lie flat

<p/><div class="bookquote">``You're fighting a losing battle there, dear,''  (<font color='red'><b>He</b></font>)</div>said his (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) mirror in a
vvheezy voice.

<p/>As the days slipped by, Harry started looking wherever he (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) went for a
sign of Ron or Hermione. Plenty of Hogwarts students were arriving in
Diagon Alley now, with the start of term so near. Harry met Seamus
Finnigan and Dean Thomas, his (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) fellow Gryffindors, in Quality Quidditch
Supplies, where they too were ogling the Firebolt; he (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) also ran into the
real Neville Longbottom, a round-faced, forgetful boy, outside Flourish
and Blotts. Harry didn't stop to chat; Neville appeared to have mislaid
his (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) booklist and was being told off by his (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) very formidable-looking
grandmother. Harry hoped she (<font color='blue'><b>grandmother</b></font>) never found out that he (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>)'d pretended to be
Neville while on the run from the Ministry of Magic.

<p/>Harry woke on the last day of the holidays, thinking that he (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) would at
least meet Ron and Hermione tomorrow, on the Hogwarts Express. He (<font color='blue'><b>Express</b></font>) got
up, dressed, went for a last look at the Firebolt, and was just
wondering where he (<font color='blue'><b>Express</b></font>)'d have lunch, when someone yelled his (<font color='blue'><b>Express</b></font>) name and he (<font color='blue'><b>Express</b></font>)
turned.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Harry! HARRY!''

 (<font color='red'><b>Florean Fortescue/Fortescue</b></font>)</div><p/>They were there, both of them, sitting outside Florean Fortescue's Ice
Cream Parlor -- Ron looking incredibly freckly, Her (<font color='blue'><b>Hermione</b></font>),,one very brown,
both waving frantically at him (<font color='blue'><b>Ron</b></font>).

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Finally!''  (<font color='red'><b>Ron</b></font>)</div>said Ron, grinning at Harry as he (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) sat down. <div class="bookquote">``We went to the
Leaky Cauldron, but they said you'd left, and we went to Flourish and
Blotts, and Madam Malkin's, and --''

 (<font color='red'><b>Harry/Potter/Harry Potter</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I got all my school stuff last week,''  (<font color='red'><b>Harry/Potter/Harry Potter</b></font>)</div>Harry explained. <div class="bookquote">``And how come
You knew I'm staying at the Leaky Cauldron?''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``Dad,''  (<font color='red'><b>Ron</b></font>)</div>said Ron simply.

<p/>Mr. Weasley, who worked at the Ministry of Magic, would of course have
heard the whole story of what had happened to Aunt Marge.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Did you really blow up your aunt, Harry?''  (<font color='red'><b>Hermione/HERMIONE</b></font>)</div>said Hermione in a very
serious voice.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``I didn't mean to,''  (<font color='red'><b>Harry/Potter/Harry Potter</b></font>)</div>said Harry, while Ron roared with laughter. <div class="bookquote">``I just
-- lost control.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``It's not funny, Ron,''  (<font color='red'><b>Hermione/HERMIONE</b></font>)</div>said Hermione sharply. <div class="bookquote">``Honestly, I'm amazed
Harry wasn't expelled.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``So am I,''  (<font color='red'><b>Harry/Potter/Harry Potter</b></font>)</div>admitted Harry. <div class="bookquote">``Forget expelled, I thought I was going to be
arrested.''  (<font color='red'><b>He</b></font>)</div>He (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) looked at Ron. <div class="bookquote">``Your dad doesn't know why Fudge let me
off, does he (<font color='blue'><b>dad</b></font>)?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Probably 'cause it's you, isn't it?''  (<font color='red'><b>Ron</b></font>)</div>shrugged Ron, still chuckling.
<div class="bookquote">``Famous Harry Potter and all that. I'd hate to see what the Ministry'd
do to me if I blew up an aunt. Mind you, they'd have to dig me up first,
because Mum would've killed me. Anyway, you can ask Dad yourself this
evening. We're staying at the Leaky Cauldron tonight too! So you can
come to King's Cross with us tomorrow! Hermione's there as well!''

 (<font color='red'><b>Hermione/HERMIONE</b></font>)</div><p/>Hermione nodded, beaming. <div class="bookquote">``Mum and Dad dropped me off this morning with
all my Hogwarts things.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Excellent!''  (<font color='red'><b>Harry/Potter/Harry Potter</b></font>)</div>said Harry happily. <div class="bookquote">``So, have you got all your new books
and stuff?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Look at this,''  (<font color='red'><b>Ron</b></font>)</div>said Ron, pulling a long thin box out of a bag and
opening it. <div class="bookquote">``Brand-new wand. Fourteen inches, willow, containing one
unicorn tail-hair. And we've got all our books --''  (<font color='red'><b>He</b></font>)</div>He (<font color='blue'><b>Ron</b></font>) pointed at a large
bag under his (<font color='blue'><b>Ron</b></font>) chair. <div class="bookquote">``What about those Monster Books, eh? The assistant
nearly cried when we said we wanted two.''


 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``What's all that, Hermione?''  (<font color='red'><b>Harry/Potter/Harry Potter</b></font>)</div>Harry asked, pointing at not one but three
bulging bags in the chair next to her (<font color='blue'><b>Hermione</b></font>).

<p/>,,Well, I'm taking more new subjects than you, aren't IF' said Hermione.
<div class="bookquote">``Those are my books for Arithmancy, Care of Magical Creatures,
Divination, the Study of Ancient Runes, Muggle Studies --''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``What are you doing Muggle Studies for?''  (<font color='red'><b>Ron</b></font>)</div>said Ron, rolling his (<font color='blue'><b>Ron</b></font>) eyes at
Harry. <div class="bookquote">``You're Muggle- born! Your mum and dad are Muggles! You already
know all about Muggles!''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``But it'll be fascinating to study them from the wizarding point of
view,''  (<font color='red'><b>Hermione/HERMIONE</b></font>)</div>said Hermione earnestly.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Are you planning to eat or sleep at all this year, Hermione?''  (<font color='red'><b>Harry/Potter/Harry Potter</b></font>)</div>asked
Harry, while Ron sniggered. Hermione ignored them.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``I've still got ten Galleons,''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Hermione</b></font>) said, checking her (<font color='blue'><b>Hermione</b></font>) purse. <div class="bookquote">``It's my
birthday in September, and Mum and Dad gave me some money to get myself
an early birthday present.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/>``How about a nice book? said Ron innocently.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``No, I don't think so,''  (<font color='red'><b>Hermione/HERMIONE</b></font>)</div>said Hermione composedly. <div class="bookquote">``I really want an owl.
I mean, Harry's got Hedwig and you've got Errol --''

 (<font color='red'><b>Ron</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I haven't,''  (<font color='red'><b>Ron</b></font>)</div>said Ron. <div class="bookquote">``Errol's a family owl. All I've got is Scabbers.''
 (<font color='red'><b>He</b></font>)</div>He (<font color='blue'><b>Ron</b></font>) pulled his (<font color='blue'><b>Ron</b></font>) pet rat out of his (<font color='blue'><b>Ron</b></font>) pocket. <div class="bookquote">``And I want to get him (<font color='blue'><b>Errol</b></font>) checked
over,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Ron</b></font>) added, placing Scabbers on the table in front of them. <div class="bookquote">``I
don't think Egypt agreed with him (<font color='blue'><b>Errol</b></font>).''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/>Scabbers was looking thinner than usual, and there was a definite droop
to his (<font color='blue'><b>Ron</b></font>) whiskers.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``There's a magical creature shop just over there,''  (<font color='red'><b>Harry/Potter/Harry Potter</b></font>)</div>said Harry, who knew
Diagon Alley very well by now. <div class="bookquote">``You could see if they've got anything
for Scabbers, and Hermione can get her (<font color='blue'><b>Hermione</b></font>) owl,''

 (<font color='red'><b>ice cream</b></font>)</div><p/>So they paid for their ice cream and crossed the street to the Magical
Menagerie.

<p/>There wasn't much room inside. Every inch of wall was hidden by cages.
It was smelly and very noisy because the occupants Of these cages were
all squeaking, squawking, jabbering, or hissing. The witch behind the
counter was already advising a wizard on the care of double-ended newts,
so Harry, Ron, and Hermione waited, examining the cages.

<p/>A pair of enormous purple toads sat gulping wetly and feasting on dead
blowflies. A gigantic tortoise with a jewel-encrusted shell was
glittering near the window. Poisonous orange snails were oozing slowly
up the side of their glass tank, and a fat white rabbit kept changing
into a silk top hat and back again with a loud popping noise. Then there
were cats of every color, a noisy cage of ravens, a basket of funny
custard-colored furballs that were humming loudly, and on the counter, a
vast cage of sleek black rats that were playing some sort of skipping
game using their long, bald tails.

<p/>The double-ended newt wizard left, and Ron approached the counter.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``It's my rat,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Ron</b></font>) told the witch. <div class="bookquote">``He (<font color='blue'><b>Errol</b></font>) been a bit off-color ever since I
brought him (<font color='blue'><b>Errol</b></font>) back from Egypt.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Bang him (<font color='blue'><b>Errol</b></font>) on the counter,''  (<font color='red'><b>the witch</b></font>)</div>said the witch, pulling a pair of heavy black
spectacles out of her (<font color='blue'><b>witch</b></font>) pocket.

<p/>Ron lifted Scabbers out of his (<font color='blue'><b>Ron</b></font>) inside pocket and placed him (<font color='blue'><b>Ron</b></font>) next to the
cage of his (<font color='blue'><b>Ron</b></font>) fellow rats, who stopped their skipping tricks and scuffled
to the wire for a better took.

<p/>Like nearly everything Ron owned, Scabbers the rat was secondhand -LRB-he (<font color='blue'><b>Ron</b></font>)
had once belonged to Ron's brother Percy-RRB- and a bit battered. Next to
the glossy rats in the cage, he (<font color='blue'><b>Ron</b></font>) looked especially woebegone.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Hm,''  (<font color='red'><b>the witch</b></font>)</div>said the witch, picking up Scabbers. <div class="bookquote">``How old is this rat?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Dunno,''  (<font color='red'><b>Ron</b></font>)</div>said Ron. <div class="bookquote">``Quite old. He (<font color='blue'><b>Errol</b></font>) used to belong to my brother.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``What powers does he (<font color='blue'><b>Errol</b></font>) have?''  (<font color='red'><b>the witch</b></font>)</div>said the witch, examining Scabbers closely.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Er --''  (<font color='red'><b>Scabbers</b></font>)</div>The truth was that Scabbers had never shown the faintest trace
of interesting powers. The witchs eyes moved from Scabbers's tattered
left ear to his (<font color='blue'><b>Ron</b></font>) front paw, which had a toe missing, and tutted loudly.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``He (<font color='blue'><b>Errol</b></font>)'s been through the mill, this one,''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>witch</b></font>) said.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``He (<font color='blue'><b>Errol</b></font>) was like that when Percy gave him (<font color='blue'><b>Percy</b></font>) to me,''  (<font color='red'><b>Ron</b></font>)</div>said Ron defensively.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``An ordinary common or garden rat like this can't be expected to live
longer than three years or so,''  (<font color='red'><b>the witch</b></font>)</div>said the witch. <div class="bookquote">``Now, if you were
looking for something a bit more hard-wearing, you might like one of
these --''

 (<font color='red'><b>She</b></font>)</div><p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>witch</b></font>) indicated the black rats, who promptly started skipping again. Ron
muttered, <div class="bookquote">``Show-offs.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Ron</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Well, if you Don't want a replacement, you can try this rat tonic,''
 (<font color='red'><b>the witch</b></font>)</div>said the witch, reaching under the counter and bringing out a small red
bottle.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Okay,''  (<font color='red'><b>Ron</b></font>)</div>said Ron. <div class="bookquote">``How much -- OUCH!''

 (<font color='red'><b>Ron</b></font>)</div><p/>Ron buckled as something huge and orange came soaring from the top of
the highest cage, landed on his (<font color='blue'><b>Ron</b></font>) head, and then propelled itself,
spitting madly, at Scabbers.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``NO, CROOKSHANKS, NO!''  (<font color='red'><b>the witch</b></font>)</div>cried the witch, but Scabbers, shot from between
her (<font color='blue'><b>witch</b></font>) hands like a bar of soap, landed splay-legged on the floor, and then
scampered for the door.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Scabbers!''  (<font color='red'><b>Ron</b></font>)</div>Ron shouted, racing out of the shop after him (<font color='blue'><b>Ron</b></font>); Harry
followed.

<p/>It took them nearly ten minutes to catch Scabbers, who had taken refuge
under a wastepaper bin outside Quality Quidditch Supplies. Ron stuffed
the trembling rat back into his (<font color='blue'><b>Ron</b></font>) pocket and straightened up, massaging
his (<font color='blue'><b>Ron</b></font>) head.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``What was that?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``It was either a very big cat or quite a small tiger,''  (<font color='red'><b>Harry/Potter/Harry Potter</b></font>)</div>said Harry.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Where's Hermione?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/>``Probably getting her (<font color='blue'><b>Hermione</b></font>) owl

<p/>They made their way back up the crowded street to the Magical Menagerie.
As they reached it, Hermione came out, but she (<font color='blue'><b>Hermione</b></font>) wasn't carrying an owl.
Her (<font color='blue'><b>Hermione</b></font>) arms were clamped tightly around the enormous ginger cat.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``You bought that monster?''  (<font color='red'><b>Ron</b></font>)</div>said Ron, his (<font color='blue'><b>Ron</b></font>) mouth hanging open.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``He (<font color='blue'><b>they</b></font>)'s gorgeous, isn't he (<font color='blue'><b>they</b></font>)?''  (<font color='red'><b>Hermione/HERMIONE</b></font>)</div>said Hermione, glowing.

<p/>That was a matter of opinion, thought Harry. The cat's ginger fur was
thick and fluffy, but it was definitely a bit bowlegged and its face
looked grumpy and oddly squashed, as though it had run headlong into a
brick wall. Now that Scabbers was out of sight, however, the cat was
purring contentedly in Hermione's arms.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Herinione, that thing nearly scalped me!''  (<font color='red'><b>Ron</b></font>)</div>said Ron.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``He (<font color='blue'><b>they</b></font>) didn't mean to, did you, Crookshanks?''  (<font color='red'><b>Hermione/HERMIONE</b></font>)</div>said Hermione.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``And what about Scabbers?''  (<font color='red'><b>Ron</b></font>)</div>said Ron, pointing at the lump in his (<font color='blue'><b>Ron</b></font>) chest
pocket. <div class="bookquote">``He (<font color='blue'><b>they</b></font>) needs rest and relaxation! How's he (<font color='blue'><b>they</b></font>) going to get it with
that thing around?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``That reminds me, you forgot your rat tonic,''  (<font color='red'><b>Hermione/HERMIONE</b></font>)</div>said Hermione, slapping
the small red bottle into Ron's hand. <div class="bookquote">``And stop worrying, Crookshanks
will be sleeping in my dormitory and Scabbers in yours, what's the
problem? Poor Crookshanks, that witch said he (<font color='blue'><b>they</b></font>)'d been in there for ages;
no one wanted him (<font color='blue'><b>they</b></font>).''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Wonder why,''  (<font color='red'><b>Ron</b></font>)</div>said Ron sarcastically as they set off toward the Leaky
Cauldron.

<p/>They found Mr. Weasley sitting in the bar, reading the Daily prophet.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Harry!''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Weasley</b></font>) said, smiling as he (<font color='blue'><b>Weasley</b></font>) looked up. <div class="bookquote">``How are you?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Fine, thanks,''  (<font color='red'><b>Harry/Potter/Harry Potter</b></font>)</div>said Harry as he (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>), Ron, and Hermione joined Mr. Weasley
with A their shopping.

<p/>Mr. Weasley put down his (<font color='blue'><b>Weasley</b></font>) paper, and Harry saw the now familiar picture
of Sirius Black staring up at him (<font color='blue'><b>Black</b></font>).

<p/><div class="bookquote">``They still haven't caught him (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>), then?''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Black</b></font>) asked.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``No,''  (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Weasley</b></font>)</div>said Mr. Weasley, looking extremely grave. <div class="bookquote">``They've pulled us all
off our regular jobs at the Ministry to try and find him (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>), but no luck so
far.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Would we get a reward if we caught him (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>)?''  (<font color='red'><b>Ron</b></font>)</div>asked Ron. <div class="bookquote">``It'd be good to
get some more money --''

 (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Weasley</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Don't be ridiculous, Ron,''  (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Weasley</b></font>)</div>said Mr. Weasley, who on closer inspection
looked very strained. <div class="bookquote">``Black's not going to be caught by a
thirteen-year-old wizard. It's the Azkaban guards who'll get him (<font color='blue'><b>Black</b></font>) back,
You mark my words.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Mrs. Weasley</b></font>)</div><p/>At that moment Mrs. Weasley entered the bar, laden with shopping bags
and followed by the twins, Fred and George, who were about to start
their fifth year at Hogwarts; the newly elected Head Boy, Percy; and the
Weasleys' youngest child and only girl, Ginny.

<p/>Ginny, who had always been very taken with Harry, seemed even more
heartily embarrassed than usual when she (<font color='blue'><b>Ginny</b></font>) saw him (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>), perhaps because he (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) had
saved her (<font color='blue'><b>Ginny</b></font>) life during their previous year at Hogwarts. She (<font color='blue'><b>Ginny</b></font>) went very red
and muttered <div class="bookquote">``hello''  (<font color='red'><b>She</b></font>)</div>without looking at him (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>). Percy, however, held out
his (<font color='blue'><b>Percy</b></font>) hand solemnly as though he (<font color='blue'><b>Percy</b></font>) and Harry had never met and said, ``Harry.
How nice to see you.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Hello, Percy,''  (<font color='red'><b>Harry/Potter/Harry Potter</b></font>)</div>said Harry, trying not to laugh.

<p/>I hope you're well?'' said Percy pompously, shaking hands. It was rather
like being introduced to the mayor.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Very well, thanks --''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Harry!''  (<font color='red'><b>Fred/Fred Weasley</b></font>)</div>said Fred, elbowing Percy out of the way and bowing deeply.
<div class="bookquote">``Simply splendid to see you, old boy --''

 (<font color='red'><b>George/George Weasley/Weasley</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Marvelous,''  (<font color='red'><b>George/George Weasley/Weasley</b></font>)</div>said George, pushing Fred aside and seizing Harry's hand in
turn. <div class="bookquote">``Absolutely spiffing.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Percy/Weasley/Percy Weasley</b></font>)</div><p/>Percy scowled.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``That's enough, now,''  (<font color='red'><b>Mrs. Weasley</b></font>)</div>said Mrs. Weasley.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Mum!''  (<font color='red'><b>Fred/Fred Weasley</b></font>)</div>said Fred as though he (<font color='blue'><b>Percy</b></font>)'d only just spotted her (<font color='blue'><b>Weasley</b></font>) and seizing her (<font color='blue'><b>Weasley</b></font>)
hand too. <div class="bookquote">``How really corking to see you --''

 (<font color='red'><b>Mrs. Weasley</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I said, that's enough,''  (<font color='red'><b>Mrs. Weasley</b></font>)</div>said Mrs. Weasley, depositing her (<font color='blue'><b>Weasley</b></font>) shopping in
an empty chair. <div class="bookquote">``Hello, Harry, dear. I suppose you've heard our exciting
news?''  (<font color='red'><b>She</b></font>)</div>She (<font color='blue'><b>Weasley</b></font>) pointed to the brand-new silver badge on Percy's chest.
<div class="bookquote">``Second Head Boy in the family!''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Weasley</b></font>) said, swelling with pride.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``And last,''  (<font color='red'><b>Fred/Fred Weasley</b></font>)</div>Fred muttered under his (<font color='blue'><b>Fred</b></font>) breath.

<p/>I don't doubt that,'' said Mrs. Weasley, frowning suddenly. <div class="bookquote">``I notice
they haven't made you two prefects.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``What do we want to be prefects for?''  (<font color='red'><b>George/George Weasley/Weasley</b></font>)</div>said George, looking revolted at
the very idea. <div class="bookquote">``It'd take all the fun out of life.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Ginny</b></font>)</div><p/>Ginny giggled.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Yo u want to set a better example for your sister!''  (<font color='red'><b>Mrs. Weasley</b></font>)</div>snapped Mrs.
Weasley.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Ginny's got other brothers to set her (<font color='blue'><b>Ginny</b></font>) an example, Mother,''  (<font color='red'><b>Percy/Weasley/Percy Weasley</b></font>)</div>said Percy
loftily. <div class="bookquote">``I'm going up to change for dinner...''

 (<font color='red'><b>He</b></font>)</div><p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Percy</b></font>) disappeared and George heaved a sigh.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``We tried to shut him (<font color='blue'><b>Boy</b></font>) in a pyramid,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>George</b></font>) told Harry. <div class="bookquote">``But Mum spotted
us.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/>Dinner that night was a very enjoyable affair. Tom the innkeeper put
three tables together in the parlor, and the seven Weasleys, Harry, and
Hermione ate their way through five delicious courses.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``How're we getting to King's Cross tomorrow, Dad?''  (<font color='red'><b>Fred/Fred Weasley</b></font>)</div>asked Fred as they
dug into a sumptuous chocolate pudding.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``The Ministry's providing a couple of cars,''  (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Weasley</b></font>)</div>said Mr. Weasley.

<p/>Everyone looked up at him (<font color='blue'><b>Weasley</b></font>).

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Why?''  (<font color='red'><b>Percy/Weasley/Percy Weasley</b></font>)</div>said Percy curiously.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``It's because of you, Perce,''  (<font color='red'><b>George/George Weasley/Weasley</b></font>)</div>said George seriously. <div class="bookquote">``And there'll be
little flags on the hoods, with HB on them''

 (<font color='red'><b>Fred/Fred Weasley</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">''-- for Humongous Bighead,''  (<font color='red'><b>Fred/Fred Weasley</b></font>)</div>said Fred.

<p/>Everyone except Percy and Mrs. Weasley snorted into their pudding.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Why are the Ministry providing cars, Father?''  (<font color='red'><b>Percy/Weasley/Percy Weasley</b></font>)</div>Percy asked again, in a
dignified voice.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Well, as we haven't got one anymore,''  (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Weasley</b></font>)</div>said Mr. Weasley,

<p/><div class="bookquote">''-- and as I work there, they're doing me a favor --''

 (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Weasley</b></font>)</div><p/>His (<font color='blue'><b>Weasley</b></font>) voice was casual, but Harry couldn't help noticing that Mr.
Weasley's ears had gone red, just like Ron's did when he (<font color='blue'><b>Ron</b></font>) was under
Pressure.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Good thing, too,''  (<font color='red'><b>Mrs. Weasley</b></font>)</div>said Mrs. Weasley briskly. <div class="bookquote">``Do you realize how much
luggage you've all got between you? A nice sight you'd be on the Muggle
Underground... You are all packed, aren't you?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Ron hasn't put all his (<font color='blue'><b>Ron</b></font>) new things in his (<font color='blue'><b>Ron</b></font>) trunk yet,''  (<font color='red'><b>Percy/Weasley/Percy Weasley</b></font>)</div>said Percy, in a
long-suffering voice. <div class="bookquote">``He (<font color='blue'><b>Ron</b></font>)'s dumped them on my bed.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``You'd better go and pack properly, Ron, because we won't have much time
in the morning,''  (<font color='red'><b>Mrs. Weasley</b></font>)</div>Mrs. Weasley called down the table. Ron scowled at
Percy.

<p/>After dinner everyone felt very full and sleepy. One by one they made
their way upstairs to their rooms to check their things for the next
day. Ron and Percy were next door to Harry. He (<font color='blue'><b>Ron</b></font>) had just closed and
locked his (<font color='blue'><b>Ron</b></font>) own trunk when he (<font color='blue'><b>Ron</b></font>) heard angry voices through the wall, and
went to see what was going on.

<p/>The door of number twelve was ajar and Percy was shouting.

<p/>``It was here, on the bedside table, I took it off for polishing

<p/><div class="bookquote">``I haven't touched it, all right?''  (<font color='red'><b>Ron</b></font>)</div>Ron roared back.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``What's up?''  (<font color='red'><b>Harry/Potter/Harry Potter</b></font>)</div>said Harry.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``My Head Boy badge is gone,''  (<font color='red'><b>Percy/Weasley/Percy Weasley</b></font>)</div>said Percy, rounding on Harry.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``So's Scabbers's rat tonic,''  (<font color='red'><b>Ron</b></font>)</div>said Ron, throwing things out of his (<font color='blue'><b>Ron</b></font>) trunk
to look. <div class="bookquote">``I think I might've left it in the bar --''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``You're not going anywhere till you've found my badge!''  (<font color='red'><b>Percy/Weasley/Percy Weasley</b></font>)</div>yelled Percy.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``I'll get Scabbers's stuff, I'm packed,''  (<font color='red'><b>Harry/Potter/Harry Potter</b></font>)</div>Harry said to Ron, and he (<font color='blue'><b>Ron</b></font>) went
downstairs.

<p/>Harry was halfway along the passage to the bar, which was now very dark,
when he (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) heard another pair of angry voices coming from the parlor. A
second later, he (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) recognized them as Mr. and Mrs.

<p/>Weasleys'. He (<font color='blue'><b>Weasleys</b></font>) hesitated, not wanting them to know he (<font color='blue'><b>Weasleys</b></font>)'d heard them
arguing, when the sound of his (<font color='blue'><b>Weasleys</b></font>) own name made him (<font color='blue'><b>Weasleys</b></font>) stop, then move closer
to the parlor door.

<p/><div class="bookquote">''--makes no sense not to tell him (<font color='blue'><b>Weasleys</b></font>),''  (<font color='red'><b>him</b></font>)</div>Mr. Weasley was saying heatedly.
<div class="bookquote">``Harry's got a right to know. I've tried to tell Fudge, but he (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) insists
on treating Harry like a child. He (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>)'s thirteen years old and --''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Arthur, the truth would terrify him (<font color='blue'><b>Arthur</b></font>)!''  (<font color='red'><b>Mrs. Weasley</b></font>)</div>said Mrs. Weasley shrilly. <div class="bookquote">``Do

For heaven's sake, he (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>)'s happy not knowing!''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I don't want to make him (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) miserable, I want to put him (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) on his (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) guard!''
 (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Weasley</b></font>)</div>retorted Mr. Weasley. <div class="bookquote">``You know what Harry and Ron are like, wandering

<p/>There was a thud on wood, and Harry was sure Mr. Weasley had banged his (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>)
fist on the table.

<p/>``Molly, how many times do I have to tell you? They didn't report it in
the press because Fudge wanted it kept quiet, but Fudge went out to
Azkaban the night Black escaped. The guards told Fudge that Blacks been
talking in his (<font color='blue'><b>Fudge</b></font>) sleep for a while now. Always the same words: ``He (<font color='blue'><b>Fudge</b></font>)'s at
Hogwarts... he (<font color='blue'><b>Fudge</b></font>)'s at Hogwarts.<div class="bookquote">'' Black is deranged, Molly, and he (<font color='blue'><b>Black</b></font>) wants
Harry dead. If you ask me, he (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) thinks murdering Harry will bring
You-Know-Who back to pow er. Black lost everything the night Harry
stopped You- Know-Who, and he (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>)'s had twelve years alone in Azkaban to
brood on that...''

 (<font color='red'><b>Hogwarts/Hogwarts Express</b></font>)</div><p/>There was a silence. Harry leaned still closer to the door, desperate to
hear more.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Well, Arthur, you must do what you think is right. But you're
forgetting Albus Dumbledore. I don't think anything could hurt Harry at
Hogwarts while Dumbledore's headmaster. I suppose he (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) knows about all
this?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Of course he (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) knows. We had to ask him (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) if he (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) minds the Azkaban guards
stationing themselves around the entrances to the school grounds. He (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>)
wasn't happy about it, but he (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) agreed.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Not happy? Why shouldn't he (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) be happy, if they're there to catch Black?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Dumbledore isn't fond of the Azkaban guards,''  (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Weasley</b></font>)</div>said Mr. Weasley heavily.
<div class="bookquote">``Nor am 1, if it comes to that... but when you're dealing with a wizard
like Black, you sometimes have to join forces with those you'd rather
avoid.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/>``If they save Harry then I will never say another word against them,
said Mr. Weasley wearily. <div class="bookquote">``It's late, Molly, we'd better go up...''

 (<font color='red'><b>Harry/Potter/Harry Potter</b></font>)</div><p/>Harry heard chairs move. As quietly as he (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) could, he (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) hurried down the
passage to the bar and out of sight. The parlor door opened, and a few
seconds later footsteps told him (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) that Mr. and Mrs. Weasley were climbing
the stairs.

<p/>The bottle of rat tonic was lying under the table they had sat at
earlier. Harry waited until he (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) heard Mr. and Mrs. Weasley's bedroom door
close, then headed back upstairs with the bottle.

<p/>Fred and George were crouching in the shadows on the landing, heaving
with laughter as they listened to Percy dismantling his (<font color='blue'><b>Percy</b></font>) and Ron's room
in search of his (<font color='blue'><b>Percy</b></font>) badge.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``We've got it,''  (<font color='red'><b>Fred/Fred Weasley</b></font>)</div>Fred whispered to Harry. <div class="bookquote">``We've been improving it.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Bighead Boy</b></font>)</div><p/>The badge now read Bighead Boy.

<p/>Harry forced a laugh, went to give Ron the rat tonic, then shut himself
in his (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) room and lay down on his (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) bed.

<p/>So Sirius Black was after him (<font color='blue'><b>Black</b></font>). This explained everything. Fudge had been
lenient with him (<font color='blue'><b>Black</b></font>) because he (<font color='blue'><b>Black</b></font>) was so relieved to find him (<font color='blue'><b>Black</b></font>) alive. He (<font color='blue'><b>Black</b></font>)'d made
Harry promise to stay in Diagon Alley where there were plenty of wizards
to keep an eye on him (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>). And he (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) was sending two Ministry cars to take them
all to the station tomorrow, so that the Weasleys could look after Harry
until he (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) was on the train.

<p/>Harry lay listening to the muffled shouting next door and wondered why
he (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) didn't feel more scared. Sirius Black had murdered thirteen people
with one curse; Mr. and Mrs, Weasley obviously thought Harry would be
panic-stricken if he (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) knew the truth. But Harry happened to agree
wholeheartedly with Mrs. Weasley that the safest place on earth was
wherever Albus Dumbledore happened to be. Didn't people always say that
Dumbledore was the only person Lord Voldemort had ever been afraid of?
Surely Black, as Voldemort's right-hand man, would be just as frightened
of him (<font color='blue'><b>Voldemort</b></font>)?

<p/>And then there were these Azkaban guards everyone kept talking about.
They seemed to scare most people senseless, and if they were stationed
all around the school, Black's chances of getting inside seemed very
remote.

<p/>No, all in all, the thing that bothered Harry most was the fact that his (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>)
chances of visiting Hogsmeade now looked like zero. Nobody would want
Harry to leave the safety of the castle until Black was caught; in fact,
Harry suspected his (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) every move would be carefully watched until the
danger had passed.

<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) scowled at the dark ceiling. Did they think he (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) couldn't look after
himself? He (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>)'d escaped Lord Voldemort three times; he (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) wasn't completely
useless...

<p/>Unbidden, the image of the beast in the shadows of Magnolia Crescent
crossed his (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) mind. What to do when you know the worst is coming...

<p/><div class="bookquote">``I'm not going to be murdered,''  (<font color='red'><b>Harry/Potter/Harry Potter</b></font>)</div>Harry said out loud.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``That's the spirit, dear,''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>said his (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) mirror sleepily.

<p/>CHAPTER FIVE

<p/>THE DEMENTOR

<p/>Tom woke Harry the next morning with his (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) usual toothless grin and a cup
of tea. Harry got dressed and was just persuading a disgruntled Hedwig
to get back into her (<font color='blue'><b>Hedwig</b></font>) cage when Ron banged his (<font color='blue'><b>Ron</b></font>) way into the room, pulling
a sweatshirt over his (<font color='blue'><b>Ron</b></font>) head and looking irritable.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``The sooner we get on the train, the better,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Ron</b></font>) said. <div class="bookquote">``At least I can
get away from Percy at Hogwarts. Now he (<font color='blue'><b>Percy</b></font>)'s accusing me of dripping tea on
his (<font color='blue'><b>Percy</b></font>) photo of Penelope Clearwater. You know,''  (<font color='red'><b>Ron</b></font>)</div>Ron grimaced, <div class="bookquote">``his (<font color='blue'><b>Percy</b></font>)
girlfriend. She (<font color='blue'><b>girlfriend</b></font>)'s hidden her (<font color='blue'><b>girlfriend</b></font>) face under the frame because her (<font color='blue'><b>girlfriend</b></font>) nose has
gone all blotchy...''

 (<font color='red'><b>Ron</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I've got something to tell you,''  (<font color='red'><b>Harry/Potter/Harry Potter</b></font>)</div>Harry began, but they were interrupted
by Fred and George, who had looked in to congratulate Ron on infuriating
Percy again.

<p/>They headed down to breakfast, where Mr. Weasley was reading the front
page of the Daily Prophet with a furrowed brow and Mrs. Weasley was
telling Hermione and Ginny about a love potion she (<font color='blue'><b>Ginny</b></font>)'d made as a young
girl. All three of them were rather giggly.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``What were you saying?''  (<font color='red'><b>Ron</b></font>)</div>Ron asked Harry as they sat down.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Later,''  (<font color='red'><b>Harry/Potter/Harry Potter</b></font>)</div>Harry muttered as Percy stormed in.

<p/>Harry had no chance to speak to Ron or Hermione in the chaos of leaving;
they were too busy heaving all their trunks down the Leaky Cauldron's
narrow staircase and piling them up near the door, with Hedwig and
Hermes, Percy's screech owl, perched on top in their cages. A small
wickerwork basket stood beside the heap of trunks, spitting loudly.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``It's all right, Crookshanks,''  (<font color='red'><b>Hermione/HERMIONE</b></font>)</div>Hermione cooed through the wickerwork.
<div class="bookquote">``I'll let you out on the train.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``You won't,''  (<font color='red'><b>Ron</b></font>)</div>snapped Ron. <div class="bookquote">``What about poor Scabbers, eh?''

 (<font color='red'><b>He</b></font>)</div><p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Ron</b></font>) pointed at his (<font color='blue'><b>Ron</b></font>) chest, where a large lump indicated that Scabbers was
curled up in his (<font color='blue'><b>Ron</b></font>) pocket.

<p/>Mr. Weasley, who had been outside waiting for the Ministry cars, stuck
his (<font color='blue'><b>Weasley</b></font>) head inside.

<p/>``They're here, he (<font color='blue'><b>Percy</b></font>) said. <div class="bookquote">``Harry, come on.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Weasley</b></font>)</div><p/>Mr. Weasley marched Harry across the short stretch of pavement toward
the first of two old- fashioned dark green cars, each of which was
driven by a furtive-looking wizard wearing a suit of emerald velvet.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``In you get, Harry,''  (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Weasley</b></font>)</div>said Mr. Weasley, glancing up and down the crowded
street.

<p/>Harry got into the back of the car and was shortly joined by Hermione,
Ron, and, to Ron's disgust, Percy.

<p/>The journey to King's Cross was very uneventful compared with Harry's
trip on the Knight Bus. The Ministry of Magic cars seemed almost
ordinary. though Harry noticed that they could slide through gaps that
Uncle Vernon's new company car certainly couldn't have managed. They
reached King's Cross with twenty minutes to spare; the Ministry drivers
found them trolleys, unloaded their trunks, touched their hats in salute
to Mr. Weasley, and drove away, somehow managing to jump to the head of
an unmoving line at the traffic lights.

<p/>Mr. Weasley kept close to Harry's elbow all the way into the station.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Right then,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) said, glancing around them. <div class="bookquote">``Let's do this in pairs, as
there are so many of us. I'll go through first with Harry.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Weasley</b></font>)</div><p/>Mr. Weasley strolled toward the barrier between platforms nine and ten,
pushing Harry's trolley and apparently very interested in the InterCity
125 that had just arrived at platform nine. With a meaningful look at
Harry, he (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) leaned casually against the barrier. Harry imitated him (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>).

<p/>In a moment, they had fallen sideways through the solid metal onto
platform nine and three- quarters and looked up to see the Hogwarts
Express, a scarlet steam engine, puffing smoke over a platform packed
with witches and wizards seeing their children onto the train.

<p/>Percy and Ginny suddenly appeared behind Harry. They were panting and
had apparently taken the barrier at a run.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Ah, there's Penelope!''  (<font color='red'><b>Percy/Weasley/Percy Weasley</b></font>)</div>said Percy, smoothing his (<font color='blue'><b>Percy</b></font>) hair and going Pink
again. Ginny caught Harry's eye, and they both turned away to hide their
laughter as Percy strode over to a girl with long, curly hair, walking
with his (<font color='blue'><b>Percy</b></font>) chest thrown out so that she (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) couldn't miss his (<font color='blue'><b>Percy</b></font>) shiny badge.
stood back to let him (<font color='blue'><b>Percy</b></font>) on. They leaned out of the window and waved at Mr.
and Mrs. Weasley until the train turned a corner and blocked them from
view.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``I need to talk to you in private,''  (<font color='red'><b>Harry/Potter/Harry Potter</b></font>)</div>Harry muttered to Ron and Hermione
as the train picked up speed.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Go away, Ginny,''  (<font color='red'><b>Ron</b></font>)</div>said Ron.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Oh, that's nice,''  (<font color='red'><b>Ginny</b></font>)</div>said Ginny huffily, and she (<font color='blue'><b>Ginny</b></font>) stalked off.

<p/>Harry, Ron, and Hermione set off down the corridor, looking for an empty
compartment, but all were full except for the one at the very end of the
train.

<p/>This had only one occupant, a man sitting fast asleep next to the
window. Harry, Ron, and Hermione checked on the threshold. The Hogwarts
Express was usually reserved for students and they had never seen an
adult there before, except for the witch who pushed the food cart.

<p/>The stranger was wearing an extremely shabby set of wizard's robes that
had been darned in several places. He (<font color='blue'><b>stranger</b></font>) looked ill and exhausted. Though
quite young, his (<font color='blue'><b>stranger</b></font>) light brown hair was flecked with gray.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Who d'you reckon he (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) is?''  (<font color='red'><b>Ron</b></font>)</div>Ron hissed as they sat down and slid the door
shut, taking the seats farthest away from the window.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Professor R. J. Lupin,''  (<font color='red'><b>Hermione/HERMIONE</b></font>)</div>whispered Hermione at once.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``How d'you know that?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``It's on his (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) case,''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Hermione</b></font>) replied, pointing at the luggage rack over the
man's head, where there was a small, battered case held together with a
large quantity of neatly knotted string. The name Professor R. J. Lupin
was stamped across one corner in peeling letters.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Wonder what he (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) teaches?''  (<font color='red'><b>Ron</b></font>)</div>said Ron, frowning at Professor Lupin's pallid
profile.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``That's obvious,''  (<font color='red'><b>Hermione/HERMIONE</b></font>)</div>whispered Hermione. <div class="bookquote">``There's only one vacancy, isn't
there? Defense Against the Dark Arts.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Harry/Potter/Harry Potter</b></font>)</div><p/>Harry, Ron, and Hermione had already had two Defense Against the Dark
Arts teachers, both of whom had lasted only one year. There were rumors
that the job was jinxed.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``well, I hope he (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>)'s up to it,''  (<font color='red'><b>Ron</b></font>)</div>said Ron doubtfully. <div class="bookquote">``He (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) looks like on,
good hex would finish him (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) off, doesn't he (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>)? Anyway...''  (<font color='red'><b>He</b></font>)</div>He (<font color='blue'><b>Ron</b></font>) turned to
Harry. <div class="bookquote">``What were you going to tell us?''

 (<font color='red'><b>Harry/Potter/Harry Potter</b></font>)</div><p/>Harry explained all about Mr. and Mrs. Weasley's argument and the
warning Mr. Weasley had just given him (<font color='blue'><b>Weasley</b></font>). \When he (<font color='blue'><b>Weasley</b></font>)'d finished, Ron looked
thunderstruck, and Hermione had her (<font color='blue'><b>Hermione</b></font>) hands over her (<font color='blue'><b>Hermione</b></font>) mouth. She (<font color='blue'><b>Hermione</b></font>) finally
lowered them to say, <div class="bookquote">``Sirius Black escaped to come after you? Oh,
Harry... you'll have to be really, really careful. don't go looking for
trouble, Harry --''

 (<font color='red'><b>She</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I Don't go looking for trouble,''  (<font color='red'><b>Harry/Potter/Harry Potter</b></font>)</div>said Harry, nettled. <div class="bookquote">``Trouble usually
finds me.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``How thick would Harry have to be, to go looking for a nutter who wants
to kill him (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>)?''  (<font color='red'><b>Ron</b></font>)</div>said Ron shakily.

<p/>They were taking the news worse than Harry had expected. Both Ron and
Hermione seemed to be much more frightened of Black than he (<font color='blue'><b>Ron</b></font>) was.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``No one knows how he (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) got out of Azkaban,''  (<font color='red'><b>Ron</b></font>)</div>said Ron uncomfortably. <div class="bookquote">``No
one's ever done it before. And he (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) was a top-security prisoner too.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``But they'll catch him (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>), won't they?''  (<font color='red'><b>Hermione/HERMIONE</b></font>)</div>said Hermione earnestly. <div class="bookquote">``I Mean,
they've got all the Muggles looking out for him (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) too...''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``What's that
noise?''  (<font color='red'><b>Ron</b></font>)</div>said Ron suddenly.

<p/>A faint, tinny sort of whistle was coming from somewhere. The, looked
all around the compartment.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``It's coming from your trunk, Harry,''  (<font color='red'><b>Ron</b></font>)</div>said Ron, standing UP and reaching
into the luggage rack. A moment later he (<font color='blue'><b>Ron</b></font>) had pulled the Pocket
Sneakoscope out from between Harry's robes. It was spinning very fast in
the palm of Ron's hand and glowing brilliantly.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Is that a Sneakoscope?''  (<font color='red'><b>Hermione/HERMIONE</b></font>)</div>said Hermione interestedly, standing up for a
better look.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Yeah... mind you, it's a very cheap one,''  (<font color='red'><b>Ron</b></font>)</div>Ron said. <div class="bookquote">``It went haywire
just as I was tying it to Errol's leg to send it to Harry.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Were you doing anything untrustworthy at the time?''  (<font color='red'><b>Hermione/HERMIONE</b></font>)</div>said Hermione
shrewdly.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``No! Well... I wasn't supposed to be using Errol. You know he (<font color='blue'><b>Errol</b></font>)'s not
really up to long journeys... but how else was I supposed to get Harry's
present to him (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>)?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Stick it back in the trunk,''  (<font color='red'><b>Harry/Potter/Harry Potter</b></font>)</div>Harry advised as the Sneakoscope whistled
piercingly, <div class="bookquote">``or it'll wake him (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) up.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Sneakoscope</b></font>)</div><p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) nodded toward Professor Lupin. Ron stuffed the Sneakoscope into a
particularly horrible pair of Uncle Vernon's old socks, which deadened
the sound, then closed the lid of the trunk on it.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``We could get it checked in Hogsmeade,''  (<font color='red'><b>Ron</b></font>)</div>said Ron, sitting back down.
<div class="bookquote">``They sell that sort of thing in Dervish and Banges, magical instruments
and stuff. Fred and George told me.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Do you know much about Hogsmeade?''  (<font color='red'><b>Hermione/HERMIONE</b></font>)</div>asked Hermione keenly. <div class="bookquote">``I've read
it's the only entirely non-Muggle settlement in Britain --''

 (<font color='red'><b>Ron</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Yeah, I think it is,''  (<font color='red'><b>Ron</b></font>)</div>said Ron in an offhand sort of way.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``But that's not Why I want to go. I just want to get inside Honey
Dukes.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``What's that?''  (<font color='red'><b>Hermione/HERMIONE</b></font>)</div>said Hermione.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``It's this sweetshop,''  (<font color='red'><b>Ron</b></font>)</div>said Ron, a dreamy look coming over his (<font color='blue'><b>Ron</b></font>) face,
<div class="bookquote">``where they've got everything... Pepper Imps -- they make you smoke at
the mouth -- and great fat Chocoballs full of strawberry mousse and
clotted cream, and really excellent sugar quills, which you can suck in
class and just look like you're thinking what to write next --''

 (<font color='red'><b>Ron</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``But Hogsmeade's a very interesting place, isn't it?''  (<font color='red'><b>Ron</b></font>)</div>Hermione pressed
on eagerly. <div class="bookquote">``In Sites of Historical Sorcery it says the inn was the
headquarters for the 1612 goblin rebellion, and the Shrieking Shades
supposed to be the most severely haunted building in Britain --''

 (<font color='red'><b>Ron</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">''-- and massive sherbert balls that make you levitate a few inches off
the ground while you're sucking them,''  (<font color='red'><b>Ron</b></font>)</div>said Ron, who was plainly not
listening to a word Hermione was saying.

<p/>Hermione looked around at Harry.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Won't it be nice to get out of school for a bit and explore Hogsmeade?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">''`Spect it will,''  (<font color='red'><b>Harry/Potter/Harry Potter</b></font>)</div>said Harry heavily. <div class="bookquote">``You'll have to tell me when
You've found out.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``What d'you mean?''  (<font color='red'><b>Ron</b></font>)</div>said Ron.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``I can't go. The Dursleys didn't sign my permission form, and Fudge
wouldn't either.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Ron</b></font>)</div><p/>Ron looked horrified.

<p/>''<div class="bookquote">``You're not allowed to come? But -- no way -- McGonagall or someone
will give you permission -- ''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>musclely; Crabbe was taller, with a
pudding-bowl haircut and a very thick neck; Goyle had short, bristly
hair and long, gorilla-ish arms.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Well, look who it is,''  (<font color='red'><b>Malfoy/Draco Malfoy/Draco</b></font>)</div>said Malfoy in his (<font color='blue'><b>Malfoy</b></font>) usual lazy drawl, pulling
open the compartment door. <div class="bookquote">``Potty and the Weasel.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Crabbe</b></font>)</div><p/>Crabbe and Goyle chuckled trollishly.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``I heard your father finally got his (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) hands on some gold this summer,
Weasley,''  (<font color='red'><b>Malfoy/Draco Malfoy/Draco</b></font>)</div>said Malfoy. <div class="bookquote">``Did your mother die of shock?''

 (<font color='red'><b>Ron</b></font>)</div><p/>Ron stood up so quickly he (<font color='blue'><b>Ron</b></font>) knocked Crookshanks's basket to the floor.
Professor Lupin gave a snort.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Who's that?''  (<font color='red'><b>Malfoy/Draco Malfoy/Draco</b></font>)</div>said Malfoy, taking an automatic step backward as he (<font color='blue'><b>Malfoy</b></font>)
spotted Lupin.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``New teacher,''  (<font color='red'><b>Harry/Potter/Harry Potter</b></font>)</div>said Harry, who got to his (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) feet, too, in case he (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) needed
to hold Ron back. <div class="bookquote">``What were you saying, Malfoy?''

 (<font color='red'><b>Malfoy/Draco Malfoy/Draco</b></font>)</div><p/>Malfoy's pale eyes narrowed; he (<font color='blue'><b>Malfoy</b></font>) wasn't fool enough to pick a fight right
under a teacher's nose.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``C'mon,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Malfoy</b></font>) muttered resentfully to Crabbe and Goyle, and they
disappeared.

<p/>Harry and Ron sat down again, Ron massaging his (<font color='blue'><b>Ron</b></font>) knuckles.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``I'm not going to take any crap from Malfoy this year,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Ron</b></font>) said angrily.
<div class="bookquote">``I mean it. If he (<font color='blue'><b>Malfoy</b></font>) makes one more crack about my family, I'm going to get
hold of his (<font color='blue'><b>Malfoy</b></font>) head and --''

 (<font color='red'><b>Ron</b></font>)</div><p/>Ron made a violent gesture in midair.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Ron,''  (<font color='red'><b>Hermione/HERMIONE</b></font>)</div>hissed Hermione, pointing at Professor Lupin, <div class="bookquote">``be careful...''

 (<font color='red'><b>Lupin/R. J. Lupin</b></font>)</div><p/>But Professor Lupin was still fast asleep.

<p/>The rain thickened as the train sped yet farther north; the windows were
now a solid, shimmering gray, which graduily darkened until lanterns
flickered into life all along the corridors and over the luggage racks.
The train rattled, the rain hammered, the ind roared, but still,
Professor Lupin slept.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``We must be nearly there,''  (<font color='red'><b>Ron</b></font>)</div>said Ron, leaning forward to look past
Professor Lupin at the now completely black window.

<p/>The words had hardly left him (<font color='blue'><b>Ron</b></font>) when the train started to slow down.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Great,''  (<font color='red'><b>Ron</b></font>)</div>said Ron, getting up and walking carefully past Professor Lupin
to try and see outside. ``I'm starving. I want to get to the feast...

<p/><div class="bookquote">``We can't be there yet,''  (<font color='red'><b>Hermione/HERMIONE</b></font>)</div>said Hermione, checking her (<font color='blue'><b>Hermione</b></font>) watch.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``So why're we stopping?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/>The train was getting slower and slower. As the noise of the pistons
fell away, the wind and rain sounded louder than ever against the
windows.

<p/>Harry, who was nearest the door, got up to look into the corridor. All
along the carriage, heads were sticking curiously out of their
compartments.

<p/>The train came to a stop with a jolt, and distant thuds and bangs told
them that luggage had fallen out of the racks. Then, without warning,
all the lamps went out and they were plunged into total darkness.

<p/><div class="bookquote">''`What's going on?''  (<font color='red'><b>Ron</b></font>)</div>said Ron's voice from behind Harry.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Ouch!''  (<font color='red'><b>Hermione/HERMIONE</b></font>)</div>gasped Hermione. <div class="bookquote">``Ron, that was my foot!''

 (<font color='red'><b>Harry/Potter/Harry Potter</b></font>)</div><p/>Harry felt his (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) way back to his (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) seat.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``D'you think we've broken down?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Dunno...''

 (<font color='red'><b>Harry/Potter/Harry Potter</b></font>)</div><p/>There was a squeaking sound, and Harry saw the dim black outline of Ron,
wiping a patch clean on the window and peering out.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``There's something moving out there,''  (<font color='red'><b>Ron</b></font>)</div>Ron said. <div class="bookquote">``I think people are
coming aboard...''

 (<font color='red'><b>someone</b></font>)</div><p/>The compartment door suddenly opened and someone fell painfully over
Harry's legs.

<p/>``Sorry -- d'you know what's going on? -- Ouch -- sorry

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Hullo, Neville,''  (<font color='red'><b>Harry/Potter/Harry Potter</b></font>)</div>said Harry, feeling around in the dark and pulling
Neville up by his (<font color='blue'><b>Neville</b></font>) cloak.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Harry? Is that you? What's happening?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``No idea -- sit down --''

 (<font color='red'><b>Neville/Neville Longbottom/Longbottom</b></font>)</div><p/>There was a loud hissing and a yelp of pain; Neville had tried to sit on
Crookshanks.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``I'm going to go and ask the driver what's going on,''  (<font color='red'><b>Hermione/HERMIONE</b></font>)</div>came Hermione's
voice. Harry felt her (<font color='blue'><b>Hermione</b></font>) pass him (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>), heard the door slide open again, and
then a thud and two loud squeals of pain.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Who's that?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Who's that?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Ginny?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Hermione?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``What are you doing?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I was looking for Ron --''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``Come in and sit down --''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Not here!''  (<font color='red'><b>Harry/Potter/Harry Potter</b></font>)</div>said Harry hurriedly. <div class="bookquote">``I'm here!''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Ouch!''  (<font color='red'><b>Neville/Neville Longbottom/Longbottom</b></font>)</div>said Neville.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Quiet!''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>said a hoarse voice suddenly.

<p/>Professor Lupin appeared to have woken up at last. Harry could hear
movements in his (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) corner.

<p/>None of them spoke.

<p/>There was a soft, crackling noise, and a shivering light filled the
compartment. Professor Lupin appeared to be holding a handful of flames.
They illuminated his (<font color='blue'><b>Professor</b></font>) tired, gray face, but his (<font color='blue'><b>Professor</b></font>) eyes looked alert and
wary.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Stay where you are,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Professor</b></font>) said in the same hoarse voice, and he (<font color='blue'><b>Professor</b></font>) got
slowly to his (<font color='blue'><b>Professor</b></font>) feet with his (<font color='blue'><b>Professor</b></font>) handful of fire held out in front of him (<font color='blue'><b>Professor</b></font>).

<p/>But the door slid slowly open before Lupin could reach it.

<p/>Standing in the doorway, illuminated by the shivering flames in Lupin's
hand, was a cloaked figure that towered to the ceiling. Its face was
completely hidden beneath its hood. Harry's eyes darted downward, and
what he (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) saw made his (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) stomach contract. There was a hand protruding from
the cloak and it was glistening, grayish, slimy-looking, and scabbed,
like something dead that had decayed in water...

<p/>But it was visible only for a split second. As though the creature
beneath the cloak sensed Harry's gaze, the hand was suddenly withdrawn
into the folds of its black cloak.

<p/>And then the thing beneath the hood, whatever it was, drew a long, slow,
rattling breath, as though it were trying to suck something more than
air from its surroundings.

<p/>An intense cold swept over them all. Harry felt his (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) own breath catch in
his (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) chest. The cold went deeper than his (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) skin. It was inside his (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) chest,
it was inside his (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) very heart...

<p/>Harry's eyes rolled up into his (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) head. He (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) couldn't see. He (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) was drowning
in cold. There was a rushing in his (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) ears as though of water. He (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) was
being dragged downward, the roaring growing louder. .

<p/>And then, from far away, he (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) heard screaming, terrible, terrified,
pleading screams. He (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) wanted to help whoever it was, he (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) tried to move his (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>)
arms, but couldn't... a thick white fog was swirling around him (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>), inside
him (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) -

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Harry! Harry! Are you all right?''

 (<font color='red'><b>him</b></font>)</div><p/>Someone was slapping his (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) face.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``W -- what?''

 (<font color='red'><b>Harry/Potter/Harry Potter</b></font>)</div><p/>Harry opened his (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) eyes; there were lanterns above him (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>), and the floor was
shaking -- the Hogwarts Express was moving again and the lights had come
back on. He (<font color='blue'><b>Express</b></font>) seemed to have slid out of his (<font color='blue'><b>Express</b></font>) seat onto the floor. Ron and
Hermione were kneeling next to him (<font color='blue'><b>Ron</b></font>), and above them he (<font color='blue'><b>Ron</b></font>) could see Neville
and Professor Lupin watching. Harry felt very sick; when he (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) put up his (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>)
hand to push his (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) glasses back on, he (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) felt cold sweat on his (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) face.

<p/>Ron and Hermione heaved him (<font color='blue'><b>Ron</b></font>) back onto his (<font color='blue'><b>Ron</b></font>) seat.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Are you okay?''  (<font color='red'><b>Ron</b></font>)</div>Ron asked nervously.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Yeah,''  (<font color='red'><b>Harry/Potter/Harry Potter</b></font>)</div>said Harry, looking quickly toward the door. The hooded creature
had vanished. <div class="bookquote">``What happened? Where's that -- that thing? Who screamed?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``No one screamed,''  (<font color='red'><b>Ron</b></font>)</div>said Ron, more nervously still.

<p/>Harry looked around the bright compartment. Ginny and Neville looked
back at him (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>), both very pale.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``But I heard screaming --''

 (<font color='red'><b>Professor</b></font>)</div><p/>A loud snap made them all jump. Professor Lupin was breaking an enormous
slab of chocolate into pieces.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Here,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Professor</b></font>) said to Harry, handing him (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) a particularly large piece. <div class="bookquote">``Eat
it. It'll help.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Harry/Potter/Harry Potter</b></font>)</div><p/>Harry took the chocolate but didn't eat it.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``What was that thing?''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) asked Lupin.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``A dementor,''  (<font color='red'><b>Lupin/R. J. Lupin</b></font>)</div>said Lupin, who was now giving chocolate to everyone else.
<div class="bookquote">``One of the dementors of Azkaban.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Everyone</b></font>)</div><p/>Everyone stared at him (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>). Professor Lupin crumpled up the empty chocolate
wrapper and put it in his (<font color='blue'><b>Professor</b></font>) pocket.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Eat,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Professor</b></font>) repeated. ``It'll help. I need to speak to the driver, excuse
me...

<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>driver</b></font>) strolled past Harry and disappeared into the corridor.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Are you sure you're okay, Harry?''  (<font color='red'><b>Hermione/HERMIONE</b></font>)</div>said Hermione, watching Harry
anxiously.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``I Don't get it... What happened?''  (<font color='red'><b>Harry/Potter/Harry Potter</b></font>)</div>said Harry, wiping more sweat off
his (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) face.

<p/>``Well -- that thing -- the dementor -- stood there and looked around -LRB-I
mean, I think it did, I couldn't see its face-RRB- -- and you -- you

<p/><div class="bookquote">``I thought you were having a fit or something,''  (<font color='red'><b>Ron</b></font>)</div>said Ron, who still
looked scared. ``You went sort of rigid and fell out of your seat and
started twitching -- 11

<p/><div class="bookquote">``And Professor Lupin stepped over you, and walked toward the dementor,
and pulled out his (<font color='blue'><b>Professor</b></font>) wand,''  (<font color='red'><b>Hermione/HERMIONE</b></font>)</div>said Hermione, ``and he (<font color='blue'><b>Professor</b></font>) said, ``None of us is
hiding Sirius Black under our cloaks. Go.<div class="bookquote">'' But the dementor didn't move,
so Lupin muttered something, and a silvery thing shot out of his (<font color='blue'><b>Ron</b></font>) wand at
it, and it turned around and sort of glided away... ''

 (<font color='red'><b>Neville/Neville Longbottom/Longbottom</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``It was horrible,''  (<font color='red'><b>Neville/Neville Longbottom/Longbottom</b></font>)</div>said Neville, in a higher voice than usual. <div class="bookquote">``Did YOU
feel how cold it got when it came in?''

 (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div><p/>I felt weird,'' said Ron, shifting his (<font color='blue'><b>Ron</b></font>) shoulders uncomfortably. <div class="bookquote">``Like I'd
never be cheerful again...''

 (<font color='red'><b>Ginny</b></font>)</div><p/>Ginny, who was huddled in her (<font color='blue'><b>Ginny</b></font>) corner looking nearly as bad as Harry
felt, gave a small sob; Hermione went over and put a comforting arm
around her (<font color='blue'><b>Hermione</b></font>).

<p/><div class="bookquote">``But didn't any of you -- fall off your seats?''  (<font color='red'><b>Harry/Potter/Harry Potter</b></font>)</div>said Harry awkwardly.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``No,''  (<font color='red'><b>Ron</b></font>)</div>said Ron, looking anxiously at Harry again. <div class="bookquote">``Ginny was shaking
like mad, though...''

 (<font color='red'><b>Harry/Potter/Harry Potter</b></font>)</div><p/>Harry didn't understand. He (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) felt weak and shivery, as though he (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) were
recovering from a bad bout of flu; he (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) also felt the beginnings of shame.
Why had he (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) gone to pieces like that, when no one else had?

<p/>Professor Lupin had come back. He (<font color='blue'><b>Professor</b></font>) paused as he (<font color='blue'><b>Professor</b></font>) entered, looked around,
and said, with a small smile, <div class="bookquote">``I haven't poisoned that chocolate, you
know...''

 (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div><p/>Harry took a bite and to his (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) great surprise felt warmth spread suddenly
to the tips of his (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) fingers and toes.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``We'll be at Hogwarts in ten minutes,''  (<font color='red'><b>Professor</b></font>)</div>said Professor Lupin. <div class="bookquote">``Are you
all right, Harry?''

 (<font color='red'><b>Harry/Potter/Harry Potter</b></font>)</div><p/>Harry didn't ask how Professor Lupin knew his (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) name.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Fine,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) muttered, embarrassed.

<p/>They didn't talk much during the remainder of the journey. At long last,
the train stopped at Hogsmeade station, and there was a great scramble
to get outside; owls hooted, cats meowed, and Neville's pet toad croaked
loudly from under his (<font color='blue'><b>Neville</b></font>) hat. It was freezing on the tiny platform; rain
was driving down in icy sheets.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Firs' years this way!''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>called a familiar voice. Harry, Ron, and
Hermione turned and saw the gigantic outline of Hagrid at the other end
of the platform, beckoning the terrified-looking new students forward
for their traditional journey across the lake.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``All right, you three?''  (<font color='red'><b>Hagrid</b></font>)</div>Hagrid yelled over the heads of the crowd. They
waved at him (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>), but had no chance to speak to him (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) because the mass of
people around them was shunting them away along the platform. Harry,
Ron, and Hermione followed the rest of the school along the platform and
out onto a rough mud track, where at least a hundred stagecoaches
awaited the remaining students, each pulled, Harry could only assume, by
an invisible horse, because when they climbed inside and shut the door,
the coach set off all by itself, bumping and swaying in procession.

<p/>The coach smelled faintly of mold and straw. Harry felt better since the
chocolate, but still weak. Ron and Hermione kept looking at him (<font color='blue'><b>Ron</b></font>)
sideways, as though frightened he (<font color='blue'><b>Ron</b></font>) might collapse again.

<p/>As the carriage trundled toward a pair of magnificent wrought iron
gates, flanked with stone columns topped with winged boars,

<p/>Harry saw two more towering, hooded dementors, standing guard on either
side. A wave of cold sickness threatened to engulf him (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) again; he (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) leaned
back into the lumpy seat and closed his (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) eyes until they had passed the
gates. The carriage picked up speed on the long, sloping drive up to the
castle; Hermione was leaning out of the tiny window, watching the many
turrets and towers draw nearer. At last, the carriage swayed to a halt,
and Hermione and Ron got out.

<p/>As Harry stepped down, a drawling, delighted voice sounded in his (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) ear.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``You fainted, Potter? Is Longbottorn telling the truth? You actualy
fainted?''

 (<font color='red'><b>Malfoy/Draco Malfoy/Draco</b></font>)</div><p/>Malfoy elbowed past Hermione to block Harry's way up the stone steps to
the castle, his (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) face gleeful and his (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) pale eyes glinting maliciously.
<div class="bookquote">``Shove off, Malfoy,''  (<font color='red'><b>Ron</b></font>)</div>said Ron, whose jaw was clenched.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Did you faint as well, Weasley?''  (<font color='red'><b>Malfoy/Draco Malfoy/Draco</b></font>)</div>said Malfoy loudly. <div class="bookquote">``Did the scary old
dementor frighten you too, Weasley?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Is there a problem?''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>said a mild voice. Professor Lupin had just gotten
out of the next carriage.

<p/>Malfoy gave Professor Lupin an insolent stare, which took in the patches
on his (<font color='blue'><b>Malfoy</b></font>) robes and the delapidated suitcase. With a tiny hint of sarcasm
in his (<font color='blue'><b>Malfoy</b></font>) voice, he (<font color='blue'><b>Malfoy</b></font>) said, <div class="bookquote">``Oh, no -- er -- Professor,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>then he (<font color='blue'><b>Malfoy</b></font>) smirked at
Crabbe and Goyle and led them up the steps into the castle.

<p/>Hermione prodded Ron in the back to make him (<font color='blue'><b>Ron</b></font>) hurry, and the three of
them joined the crowd swarming up the steps, through the giant oak front
doors, into the cavernous entrance hall, which was lit with flaming
torches, and housed a magnificent marble staircase that led to the upper
floors.

<p/>The door into the Great Hall stood open at the right; Harry followed the
crowd toward it, but had barely glimpsed the enchanted ceiling, which
was black and cloudy tonight, when a voice called, <div class="bookquote">``Potter! Granger! I
want to see you both!''

 (<font color='red'><b>Harry/Potter/Harry Potter</b></font>)</div><p/>Harry and Hermione turned around, surprised. Professor McGonagall,
Transfiguration teacher and head of Gryffindor House, was calling over
the heads of the crowd. She (<font color='blue'><b>Hermione</b></font>) was a sternlooking witch who wore her (<font color='blue'><b>Hermione</b></font>) hair
in a tight bun; her (<font color='blue'><b>Hermione</b></font>) sharp eyes were framed with square spectacles. Harry
fought his (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) way over to her (<font color='blue'><b>Hermione</b></font>) with a feeling of foreboding: Professor
McGonagall had a way of making him (<font color='blue'><b>Professor</b></font>) feel he (<font color='blue'><b>Professor</b></font>) must have done something
wrong.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``There's no need to look so worried -- I just want a word in MY office,''
 (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Hermione</b></font>) told them. <div class="bookquote">``Move along there, Weasley.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Ron</b></font>)</div><p/>Ron stared as Professor McGonagall ushered Harry and Hermione away from
the chattering crowd; they accompanied her (<font color='blue'><b>Hermione</b></font>) across the entrance hall, up
the marble staircase, and along a corridor.

<p/>Once they were in her (<font color='blue'><b>Hermione</b></font>) office, a small room with a large, welcoming fire,
Professor McGonagall motioned Harry and Hermione to sit down. She (<font color='blue'><b>Hermione</b></font>)
settled herself behind her (<font color='blue'><b>Hermione</b></font>) desk and said abruptly, <div class="bookquote">``Professor Lupin sent
an owl ahead to say that you were taken ill on the train, Potter.''

 (<font color='red'><b>She</b></font>)</div><p/>Before Harry could reply, there was a soft knock on the door and Madam
Pomfrey, the nurse, came bustling in.

<p/>Harry felt himself going red in the face. It was bad enough that he (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>)'d
passed out, or whatever he (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) had done, without everyone making all this
fuss.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``I'm fine,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) said, ``I don't need anything

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Oh, it's you, is it?''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>said Madam Pomfrey, ignoring this and bending
down to stare closely at him (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>). <div class="bookquote">``I suppose you've been doing something
dangerous again?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``It was a dementor, Poppy,''  (<font color='red'><b>Professor</b></font>)</div>said Professor McGonagall.

<p/>They exchanged a dark look, and Madam Pomfrey clucked disapprovingly.

<p/>``Setting dementors around a school, she (<font color='blue'><b>MY</b></font>) muttered, pushing back Harry's
hair and feeling his (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) forehead. ``He (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) won't be the last one who collapses.
Yes, he (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>)'s all clammy. Terrible things, they are, and the effect they
have on people who are already delicate

<p/><div class="bookquote">``I'm not delicate!''  (<font color='red'><b>people</b></font>)</div>said Harry crossly.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Of course you're not,''  (<font color='red'><b>Madam Pomfrey</b></font>)</div>said Madam Pomfrey absentmindedly, now taking
his (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) pulse.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``What does he (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) need?''  (<font color='red'><b>Professor</b></font>)</div>said Professor McGonagall crisply. <div class="bookquote">``Bed rest?
Should he (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) perhaps spend tonight in the hospital wing?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I'm fine!''  (<font color='red'><b>Harry/Potter/Harry Potter</b></font>)</div>said Harry, jumping up. The thought of what Draco Malfoy
would say if he (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) had to go to the hospital wing was torture.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Well, he (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) should have some chocolate, at the very least,''  (<font color='red'><b>Madam Pomfrey</b></font>)</div>said Madam
Pomfrey, who was now trying to peer into Harry's eyes.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``I've already had some,''  (<font color='red'><b>Harry/Potter/Harry Potter</b></font>)</div>said Harry. <div class="bookquote">``Professor Lupin gave me some. He (<font color='blue'><b>Professor</b></font>)
gave it to all of us.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Did he (<font color='blue'><b>Professor</b></font>), now?''  (<font color='red'><b>Madam Pomfrey</b></font>)</div>said Madam Pomfrey approvingly. <div class="bookquote">``So we've finally got a
Defense Against the Dark Arts teacher who knows his (<font color='blue'><b>Professor</b></font>) remedies?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Are you sure you feel all right, Potter?''  (<font color='red'><b>Professor</b></font>)</div>Professor McGonagall said
sharply.

<p/>``Yes, ``said Harry.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Very well. Kindly wait outside while I have a quick word with Miss
Granger about her (<font color='blue'><b>Granger</b></font>) course schedule, then we can go down to the feast
together.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Harry/Potter/Harry Potter</b></font>)</div><p/>Harry went back into the corridor with Madam Pomfrey, who left for the
hospital wing, muttering to herself He (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) had to wait only a few minutes;
then Hermione emerged looking very happy about something, followed by
Professor McGonagall, and the three of them made their way back down the
marble staircase to the Great Hall.

<p/>It was a sea of pointed black hats; each of the long House tables was
lined with students, their faces glimmering by the light of thousands of
candles, which were floating over the tables in midair. Professor
Flitwick, who was a tiny little wizard with a shock of white hair, was
carrying an ancient hat and a three-legged stool out of the hall.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Oh,''  (<font color='red'><b>Hermione/HERMIONE</b></font>)</div>said Hermione softly, <div class="bookquote">``we've missed the Sorting!''

 (<font color='red'><b>Hermione/HERMIONE</b></font>)</div><p/>New students at Hogwarts were sorted into Houses by trying on the
sorting Hat, which shouted out the House they were best suited to
-LRB-Gryffindor, Ravenclaw, Hufflepuff, or Slytherin-RRB-. Professor McGonagall
strode off toward her (<font color='blue'><b>Hermione</b></font>) empty seat at the staff table, and Harry and
Hermione set off in the other direction, as quietly as possible, toward
the Gryffindor table. People looked around at them as they passed along
the back of the hall, and a few of them pointed at Harry. Had the story
of his (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) collapsing in front of the dementor traveled that fast?

<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) and Hermione sat down on either side of Ron, who had saved them
seats.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``What was all that about?''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Ron</b></font>) muttered to Harry.

<p/>Harry started to explain in a whisper, but at that moment the headmaster
stood up to speak, and he (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) broke off.

<p/>Professor Dumbledore, though very old, always gave an impression of
great energy. He (<font color='blue'><b>Dumbledore</b></font>) had several feet of long silver hair and beard,
half-moon spectacles, and an extremely crooked nose. He (<font color='blue'><b>Dumbledore</b></font>) was often
described as the greatest wizard of the age, but that wasn't why Harry
respected him (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>). You couldn't help trusting Albus Dumbledore, and as Harry
watched him (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) beaming around at the students, he (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) felt really calm for the
first time since the dementor had entered the train compartment.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Welcome!''  (<font color='red'><b>Dumbledore/Albus Dumbledore</b></font>)</div>said Dumbledore, the candlelight shimmering on his (<font color='blue'><b>Dumbledore</b></font>) beard.
<div class="bookquote">``Welcome to another year at Hogwarts! I have a few things to say to you
all, and as one of them is very serious, I think it best to get it out
of the way before you become befuddled by our excellent feast...''

 (<font color='red'><b>Dumbledore/Albus Dumbledore</b></font>)</div><p/>Dumbledore cleared his (<font color='blue'><b>Dumbledore</b></font>) throat and continued, <div class="bookquote">``As you will all be aware
after their search of the Hogwarts Express, our school is presently
playing host to some of the dementors of Azkaban, who are here on
Ministry of Magic business.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Dumbledore/Albus Dumbledore</b></font>)</div><p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Dumbledore</b></font>) paused, and Harry remembered what Mr. Weasley had said about
Dumbledore not being happy with the dementors guarding the school.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``They are stationed at every entrance to the grounds,''  (<font color='red'><b>Dumbledore/Albus Dumbledore</b></font>)</div>Dumbledore
continued, <div class="bookquote">``and while they are with us, I must make it plain that nobody
is to leave school without permission. Dementors are not to be fooled by
tricks or disguises -- or even Invisibility Cloaks,''  (<font color='red'><b>Dumbledore/Albus Dumbledore</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Dumbledore</b></font>) added blandly,
and Harry and Ron glanced at each other. <div class="bookquote">``It is not in the nature of a
dementor to understand pleading or excuses. I therefore warn each and
every one of you to give them no reason to harm you. I look to the
prefects, and our new Head Boy and Girl, to make sure that no student
runs afoul of the dementors,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) said.

<p/>Percy, who was sitting a few seats down from Harry, puffed out his (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) chest
again and stared around impressively. Dumbledore paused again; he (<font color='blue'><b>Dumbledore</b></font>) looked
very seriously around the hall, and nobody moved or made a sound.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``On a happier note,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Dumbledore</b></font>) continued, I am pleased to welcome two new
teachers to our ranks this year.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``First, Professor Lupin, who has kindly consented to fill the post of
Defense Against the Dark Arts teacher.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/>There was some scattered, rather unenthusiastic applause. Only those who
had been in the compartment on the train with Professor Lupin clapped
hard, Harry among them. Professor Lupin looked particularly shabby next
to all the other teachers in their best robes.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Look at Snape!''  (<font color='red'><b>Ron</b></font>)</div>Ron hissed in Harry's ear.

<p/>Professor Snape, the Potions master, was staring along the staff table
at Professor Lupin. It was common knowledge that Snape ,anted the
Defense Against the Dark Arts job, but even Harry, who hated Snape, was
startled at the expression twisting his (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) thin, sallow face. it was beyond
anger: it was loathing. Harry knew that expression only too well; it was
the look Snape wore every time he (<font color='blue'><b>Snape</b></font>) set eyes on Harry.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``As to our second new appointment,''  (<font color='red'><b>Dumbledore/Albus Dumbledore</b></font>)</div>Dumbledore continued as the lukewarm
applause for Professor Lupin died away. <div class="bookquote">``Well, I am sorry to tell you
that Professor Kettleburn, our Care of Magical Creatures teacher,
retired at the end of last year in order to enjoy more time with his (<font color='blue'><b>Professor</b></font>)
remaining limbs. However, I am delighted to say that his (<font color='blue'><b>Professor</b></font>) place will be
filled by none other than Rubeus Hagrid, who has agreed to take on this
teaching job in addition to his (<font color='blue'><b>Professor</b></font>) gamekeeping duties.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Harry/Potter/Harry Potter</b></font>)</div><p/>Harry, Ron, and Hermione stared at one another, stunned. Then they
joined in with the applause, which was tumultuous at the Gryffindor
table in particular. Harry leaned forward to see Hagrid, who was
ruby-red in the face and staring down at his (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) enormous hands, his (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) wide
grin hidden in the tangle of his (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) black beard.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``We should've known!''  (<font color='red'><b>Ron</b></font>)</div>Ron roared, pounding the table. <div class="bookquote">``Who else would
have assigned us a biting book?''

 (<font color='red'><b>Harry/Potter/Harry Potter</b></font>)</div><p/>Harry, Ron, and Hermione were the last to stop clapping, and as
Professor Dumbledore started speaking again, they saw that Hagrid was
wiping his (<font color='blue'><b>Dumbledore</b></font>) eyes on the tablecloth.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Well, I think that's everything of importance,''  (<font color='red'><b>Dumbledore/Albus Dumbledore</b></font>)</div>said Dumbledore. <div class="bookquote">``Let
the feast begin!''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/>The golden plates and goblets before them filled suddenly with food and
drink. Harry, suddenly ravenous, helped himself to everything he (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) could
reach and began to eat.

<p/>It was a delicious feast; the hall echoed with talk, laughter, and the
clatter of knives and forks. Harry, Ron, and Hermione, however, were
eager for it to finish so that they could talk to Hagrid. They knew how
much being made a teacher would mean to him (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>). Hagrid wasn't a fully
qualified wizard; he (<font color='blue'><b>wizard</b></font>) had been expelled from Hogwarts in his (<font color='blue'><b>wizard</b></font>) third year
for a crime he (<font color='blue'><b>wizard</b></font>) had not committed. It had been Harry, Ron, and Hermione
who had cleared Hagrid's name last year.

<p/>At long last, when the last morsels of pumpkin tart had melted from the
golden platters, Dumbledore gave the word that it was time for them all
to go to bed, and they got their chance.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Congratulations, Hagrid!''  (<font color='red'><b>Hermione/HERMIONE</b></font>)</div>Hermione squealed as they reached the
teachers' table.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``All down ter you three,''  (<font color='red'><b>Hagrid</b></font>)</div>said Hagrid, wiping his (<font color='blue'><b>Dumbledore</b></font>) shining face on his (<font color='blue'><b>Dumbledore</b></font>)
napkin as he (<font color='blue'><b>Dumbledore</b></font>) looked up at them., <div class="bookquote">``Can' believe it... great man,
Dumbledore... came straight down to me hut after Professor Kettleburn
said he (<font color='blue'><b>Professor</b></font>)'d had enough... It's what I always wanted. --''

 (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div><p/>Overcome with emotion, he (<font color='blue'><b>Dumbledore</b></font>) buried his (<font color='blue'><b>Dumbledore</b></font>) face in his (<font color='blue'><b>Dumbledore</b></font>) napkin, and Professor
McGonagall shooed them away.

<p/>Harry, Ron, and Hermione joined the Gryffindors streaming up the marble
staircase and, very tired now, along more corridors, UP more and more
stairs, to the hidden entrance to Gryffindor Tower's large portrait of a
fat lady in a pink dress asked them, <div class="bookquote">``Password?''

 (<font color='red'><b>a lady</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Coming through, coming through!''  (<font color='red'><b>Percy/Weasley/Percy Weasley</b></font>)</div>Percy called from behind the crowd.
``The new password's <div class="bookquote">``Fortuna Major'!''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Oh no,''  (<font color='red'><b>Neville/Neville Longbottom/Longbottom</b></font>)</div>said Neville Longbottom sadly. He (<font color='blue'><b>Longbottom</b></font>) always had trouble
remembering the passwords.

<p/>Through the portrait hole and across the common room, the girls and boys
divided toward their separate staircases. Harry climbed the spiral stair
with no thought in his (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) head except how glad he (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) was to be back. They
reached their familiar, circular dormitory with its five four-poster
beds, and Harry, looking around, felt he (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) was home at last.

<p/>CHAPTER SIX

<p/>TALONS AND TEA LEAVES

<p/>When Harry, Ron, and Hermione entered the Great Hall for breakfast the
next day, the first thing they saw was Draco Malfoy, who seemed to be
entertaining a large group of Slytherins with a very funny story. As
they passed, Malfoy did a ridiculous impression of a swooning fit and
there was a roar of laughter.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Ignore him (<font color='blue'><b>Major</b></font>),''  (<font color='red'><b>Hermione/HERMIONE</b></font>)</div>said Hermione, who was right behind Harry. <div class="bookquote">``Just ignore
him (<font color='blue'><b>Major</b></font>), it's not worth it...''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Hey, Potter!''  (<font color='red'><b>Pansy/Pansy Parkinson</b></font>)</div>shrieked Pansy Parkinson, a Slytherin girl with a face
like a pug. <div class="bookquote">``Potter! The dementors are coming, Potter! Woooooooooo!''

 (<font color='red'><b>Harry/Potter/Harry Potter</b></font>)</div><p/>Harry dropped into a seat at the Gryffindor table, next to George
Weasley.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``New third-year course schedules,''  (<font color='red'><b>George/George Weasley/Weasley</b></font>)</div>said George, passing then, over.
<div class="bookquote">``What's up with you, Harry?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Malfoy,''  (<font color='red'><b>Ron</b></font>)</div>said Ron, sitting down on George's other side and glaring over
at the Slytherin table.

<p/>George looked up in time to see Malfoy pretending to faint with terror
again.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``That little git,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Malfoy</b></font>) said calmly. <div class="bookquote">``He (<font color='blue'><b>Malfoy</b></font>) wasn't so cocky last night when
the dementors were down at our end of the train. Came runing into our
compartment, didn't he (<font color='blue'><b>Malfoy</b></font>), Fred?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Nearly wet himself,''  (<font color='red'><b>Fred/Fred Weasley</b></font>)</div>said Fred, with a contemptuous glance at Malfoy.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``I wasn't too happy myself,''  (<font color='red'><b>George/George Weasley/Weasley</b></font>)</div>said George. <div class="bookquote">``They're horrible things,
those dementors...''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Sort of freeze your insides, don't they?''  (<font color='red'><b>Fred/Fred Weasley</b></font>)</div>said Fred.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``You didn't pass out, though, did you?''  (<font color='red'><b>Harry/Potter/Harry Potter</b></font>)</div>said Harry in a low voice.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Forget it, Harry,''  (<font color='red'><b>George/George Weasley/Weasley</b></font>)</div>said George bracingly. <div class="bookquote">``Dad had to go out to Azkaban
one time, remember, Fred? And he (<font color='blue'><b>Fred</b></font>) said it was the worst place he (<font color='blue'><b>Fred</b></font>)'d ever
been, he (<font color='blue'><b>Fred</b></font>) came back all weak and shaking... They suck the happiness out
of a place, dementors. Most of the prisoners go mad in there.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Anyway, we'll see how happy Malfoy looks after our first Quidditch
match,''  (<font color='red'><b>Fred/Fred Weasley</b></font>)</div>said Fred. <div class="bookquote">``Gryffindor versus Slytherin, first game of the
season, remember?''

 (<font color='red'><b>Harry/Potter/Harry Potter</b></font>)</div><p/>The only time Harry and Malfoy had faced each other in a Quidditch
match, Malfoy had definitely come off worse. Feeling slightly more
cheerful, Harry helped himself to sausages and fried tomatoes.

<p/>Hermione was examining her (<font color='blue'><b>Hermione</b></font>) new schedule.

<p/><div class="bookquote">'' Ooh, good, we're starting some new subjects today,''  (<font color='red'><b>Hermione/HERMIONE</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Hermione</b></font>) said happily.
villains are these, that trespass upon my private lands! Come I. scorn
at my fall, perchance? Draw, you knaves, you dogs!''

<p/>They watched in astonishment as the little knight tugged his (<font color='blue'><b>knight</b></font>) sword out
of its scabbard and began brandishing it violently, hopping up and down
in rage. But the sword was too long for him (<font color='blue'><b>knight</b></font>); a particularly wild swing
made him (<font color='blue'><b>knight</b></font>) overbalance, and he (<font color='blue'><b>knight</b></font>) landed facedown in the grass.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Are you all right?''  (<font color='red'><b>Harry/Potter/Harry Potter</b></font>)</div>said Harry, moving closer to the picture.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Get back, you scurvy braggart! Back, you rogue!''

 (<font color='red'><b>The knight</b></font>)</div><p/>The knight seized his (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) sword again and used it to push himself back up,
but the blade sank deeply into the grass and, though he (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) pulled with all
his (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) might, he (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) couldn't get it out again. Finally, he (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) had to flop back
down onto the grass and push up his (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) visor to mop his (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) sweating face.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Listen,''  (<font color='red'><b>Harry/Potter/Harry Potter</b></font>)</div>said Harry, taking advantage of the knight's exhaustion,
<div class="bookquote">``we're looking for the North Tower. You don't know the way, do you?''

 (<font color='red'><b>the knight</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``A quest!''  (<font color='red'><b>The knight</b></font>)</div>The knight's rage seemed to vanish instantly. He (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) clanked to
his (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) feet and shouted, <div class="bookquote">``Come follow me, dear friends, and we shall find
our goal, or else shall perish bravely in the charge!''

 (<font color='red'><b>He</b></font>)</div><p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) gave the sword another fruitless tug, tried and failed to mount the
fat pony, gave up, and cried, <div class="bookquote">``On foot then, good sirs and gentle lady!
On! On!''

 (<font color='red'><b>He</b></font>)</div><p/>And he (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) ran, clanking loudly, into the left side of the frame and out of
sight.

<p/>They hurried after him (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) along the corridor, following the sound of his (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>)
armor. Every now and then they spotted him (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) running through a picture
ahead.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Be of stout heart, the worst is yet to come!''  (<font color='red'><b>the knight</b></font>)</div>yelled the knight, and
they saw him (<font color='blue'><b>knight</b></font>) reappear in front of an alarmed group of women in
crinolines, whose picture hung on the wall of a narrow spiral staircase.

<p/>Puffing loudly, Harry, Ron, and Hermione climbed the tightly spiraling
steps, getting dizzier and dizzier, until at last they heard the murmur
of voices above them and knew they had reached the classroom.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Farewell!''  (<font color='red'><b>the knight</b></font>)</div>cried the knight, popping his (<font color='blue'><b>knight</b></font>) head into a painting of some
sinister-looking monks. <div class="bookquote">``Farewell, my comrades-in-arms! If ever you have
need of noble heart and steely sinew, call upon Sir Cadogan!''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Yeah, we'll call you,''  (<font color='red'><b>Ron</b></font>)</div>muttered Ron as the knight disappeared, <div class="bookquote">``if we
ever need someone mental.''

 (<font color='red'><b>the knight</b></font>)</div><p/>They climbed the last few steps and emerged onto a tiny landing, where
most of the class was already assembled. There were no doors off this
landing, but Ron nudged Harry and pointed at the ceiling, where there
was a circular trapdoor with a brass plaque on it.

<p/><div class="bookquote">''`Sibyll Trelawney, Divination teacher,'' (<font color='red'><b>Harry/Potter/Harry Potter</b></font>)</div>' Harry read. <div class="bookquote">``How're we
supposed to get up there?''

 (<font color='red'><b>Harry/Potter/Harry Potter</b></font>)</div><p/>As though in answer to his (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) question, the trapdoor suddenly opened, and a
silvery ladder descended right at Harry's feet. Everyone got quiet.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``After you,''  (<font color='red'><b>Ron</b></font>)</div>said Ron, grinning, so Harry climbed the ladder first.

<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) emerged into the strangest-looking classroom he (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) had ever seen. In
fact, it didn't look like a classroom at all, more like a cross between
someone's attic and an old-fashioned tea shop. At leasttwenty small,
circular tables were crammed inside it, all surrounded by chintz
armchairs and fat little poufs. Everything was lit with a dim, crimson
light; the curtains at the windows were all closed, and the many lamps
were draped with dark red scarves. it was stiflingly warm, and the fire
that was burning under the crowded mantelpiece was giving off a heavy,
sickly sort of perfume as it heated a large copper kettle. The shelves
running around the circular walls were crammed with dusty-looking
feathers, stubs of candles, many packs of tattered playing cards,
countless silvery crystal balls, and a huge array of teacups.

<p/>Ron appeared at Harry's shoulder as the class assembled around them, all
talking in whispers.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Where is she (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>)?''  (<font color='red'><b>Ron</b></font>)</div>Ron said.

<p/>A voice came suddenly out of the shadows, a soft, misty sort of voice.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Welcome,''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>it said. <div class="bookquote">``How nice to see you in the physical world at last.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Harry/Potter/Harry Potter</b></font>)</div><p/>Harry's immediate impression was of a large, glittering insect.
Professor Trelawney moved into the firelight, and they saw that she (<font color='blue'><b>Professor</b></font>) was
very thin; her (<font color='blue'><b>Professor</b></font>) large glasses magnified her (<font color='blue'><b>Professor</b></font>) eyes to several times their
natural size, and she (<font color='blue'><b>Professor</b></font>) was draped in a gauzy spangled shawl. Innumerable
chains and beads hung around her (<font color='blue'><b>Professor</b></font>) spindly neck, and her (<font color='blue'><b>Professor</b></font>) arms and hands
were encrusted with bangles and rings.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Sit, my children, sit,''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Professor</b></font>) said, and they all climbed awkwardly into
armchairs or sank onto poufs. Harry, Ron, and Hermione sat themselves
around the same round table.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Welcome to Divination,''  (<font color='red'><b>Professor</b></font>)</div>said Professor Trelawney, who had seated
herself in a winged armchair in front of the fire. <div class="bookquote">``My name is professor
Trelawney. You may not have seen me before. I find that descending too
often into the hustle and bustle of the main school clouds my Inner
Eye.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Nobody</b></font>)</div><p/>Nobody said anything to this extraordinary pronouncement. Professor
Trelawney delicately rearranged her (<font color='blue'><b>Hermione</b></font>) shawl and continued, <div class="bookquote">``So you have
chosen to study Divination, the most difficult of all magical arts. I
must warn you at the outset that if you do not have the Sight, there is
very little I will be able to teach you.. Books can take you only so far
in this field...''

 (<font color='red'><b>Trelawney/Sibyll/Sibyll Trelawney</b></font>)</div><p/>At these words, both Harry and Ron glanced, grinning, at Hermione, who
looked startled at the news that books wouldn't be much help in this
subject.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Many witches and wizards, talented though they are in the area of loud
bangs and smells and sudden disappearings, are yet unable to penetrate
the veiled mysteries of the future,''  (<font color='red'><b>Professor</b></font>)</div>Professor Trelawney went on, her (<font color='blue'><b>Hermione</b></font>)
enormous, gleaming eyes moving from face to nervous face. <div class="bookquote">``It is a Gift
granted to few. You, boy,''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Hermione</b></font>) said suddenly to Neville, who almost
toppled off his (<font color='blue'><b>Neville</b></font>) pouf. <div class="bookquote">``Is your grandmother well?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I think so,''  (<font color='red'><b>Neville/Neville Longbottom/Longbottom</b></font>)</div>said Neville tremulously.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``I wouldn't be so sure if I were you, dear,''  (<font color='red'><b>Professor</b></font>)</div>said Professor Trelawney,
the firelight glinting on her (<font color='blue'><b>Hermione</b></font>) long emerald earrings. Neville gulped.
Professor Trelawney continued placidly. <div class="bookquote">``We will be covering the basic
methods of Divination this year. The first term will be devoted to
reading the tea leaves. Next term we shall progress to palmistry. By the
way, my dear,''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Hermione</b></font>) shot suddenly at Parvati Patil, <div class="bookquote">``beware a red-haired
man.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Parvati/Parvati Patil</b></font>)</div><p/>Parvati gave a startled look at Ron, who was right behind her (<font color='blue'><b>Parvati</b></font>) and edged
her (<font color='blue'><b>Parvati</b></font>) chair away from him (<font color='blue'><b>Ron</b></font>).

<p/><div class="bookquote">``In the second term,''  (<font color='red'><b>Professor</b></font>)</div>Professor Trelawney went on, <div class="bookquote">``we shall progress to
the crystal ball -- if we have finished with fire omens, that is.
Unfortunately, classes will be disrupted in February by a nasty bout of
flu. I myself will lose my voice. And around Easter, one of our number
will leave us forever.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Trelawney/Sibyll/Sibyll Trelawney</b></font>)</div><p/>A very tense silence followed this pronouncement, but Professor
Trelawney seemed unaware of it.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``I wonder, dear,''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Parvati</b></font>) said to Lavender Brown, who was nearest and shrank
back in her (<font color='blue'><b>Parvati</b></font>) chair, <div class="bookquote">``if you could pass me the largest silver teapot?''

 (<font color='red'><b>Lavender Brown</b></font>)</div><p/>Lavender, looking relieved, stood up, took an enormous teapot from the
shelf, and put it down on the table in front of Professor Trelawney.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Thank you, my dear. Incidentally, that thing you are dreading -- it
will happen on Friday the sixteenth of October.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/>Lavender trembled.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Now, I want you all to divide into pairs. Collect a teacup from the
shelf, come to me, and I will fill it. Then sit down and drink, drink
until only the dregs remain. Swill these around the cup three times with
the left hand, then turn the cup upside down on its saucer, wait for the
last of the tea to drain away, then give your cup to your partner to
read. You will interpret the patterns using pages five and six of
Unfogging the Future. I shall move among you, helping and instructing.
Oh, and dear''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>-- she (<font color='blue'><b>Parvati</b></font>) caught Neville by the arm as he (<font color='blue'><b>Neville</b></font>) made to stand up --
<div class="bookquote">``after you've broken your first cup, would you be so kind as to select
one of the blue patterned ones? I'm rather attached to the pink.''

 (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div><p/>Sure enough, Neville had no sooner reached the shelf of teacups when
there was a tinkle of breaking china. Professor Trelawney swept over to
him (<font color='blue'><b>Professor</b></font>) holding a dustpan and brush and said, <div class="bookquote">``One of the blue ones, then,
dear, if you wouldn't mind... thank you. ... ''

 (<font color='red'><b>him</b></font>)</div><p/>When Harry and Ron had had their teacups filled, they went back to their
table and tried to drink the scalding tea quickly. They swilled the
dregs around as Professor Trelawney had instructed, then drained the
cups and swapped over.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Right,''  (<font color='red'><b>Ron</b></font>)</div>said Ron as they both opened their books at pages five and six.
<div class="bookquote">``What can you see in mine?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``A load of soggy brown stuff,''  (<font color='red'><b>Harry/Potter/Harry Potter</b></font>)</div>said Harry. The heavily perfumed smoke in
the room was making him (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) feel sleepy and stupid.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Broaden your minds, my dears, and allow your eyes to see past the
mundane!''  (<font color='red'><b>Professor</b></font>)</div>Professor Trelawney cried through the gloom.

<p/>Harry tried to pull himself together.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Right, you've got a crooked sort of cross... ''  (<font color='red'><b>He</b></font>)</div>He (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) consulted Unfogging
the Future. <div class="bookquote">``That means you're going to have `trials and suffering' --
sorry about that -- but there's a thing that could be the sun... hang
on... that means `great happiness'... so you're going to suffer but be
very happy...''

 (<font color='red'><b>Ron</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``You need your Inner Eye tested, if you ask me,''  (<font color='red'><b>Ron</b></font>)</div>said Ron, and they both
had to stifle their laughs as Professor Trelawney gazed in their
direction.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``My turn...''  (<font color='red'><b>Ron</b></font>)</div>Ron peered into Harry's teacup, his (<font color='blue'><b>Ron</b></font>) forehead wrinkled with
effort. <div class="bookquote">``There's a blob a bit like a bowler hat,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Ron</b></font>) said. ``Maybe you're
going to work for the Ministry of Magic...

<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>bowler</b></font>) turned the teacup the other way up.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``But this way it looks more like an acorn... What's that?''  (<font color='red'><b>He</b></font>)</div>He (<font color='blue'><b>Ron</b></font>) scanned
his (<font color='blue'><b>Ron</b></font>) copy of Unfogging the Future. <div class="bookquote">'''A windfall, unexpected gold.''
 (<font color='red'><b>He</b></font>)</div>Excellent, you can lend me some... and there's a thin, here,'' he (<font color='blue'><b>Ron</b></font>) turned
the cup again, <div class="bookquote">``that looks like an animal... yeah, if that was its
head... it looks like a hippo... no, a sheep...''

 (<font color='red'><b>me</b></font>)</div><p/>Professor Trelawney whirled around as Harry let out a snort of laughter.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Let me see that, my dear,''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) said reprovingly to Ron, sweeping over
and snatching Harry's cup from him (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>). Everyone went quiet to watch.

<p/>Professor Trelawney was staring into the teacup, rotating it
counterclockwise.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``The falcon... my dear, you have a deadly enemy.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``But everyone knows that, ''  (<font color='red'><b>Hermione/HERMIONE</b></font>)</div>said Hermione in a loud whisper. Professor
Trelawney stared at her (<font color='blue'><b>Hermione</b></font>).

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Well, they do,''  (<font color='red'><b>Hermione/HERMIONE</b></font>)</div>said Hermione. <div class="bookquote">``Everybody knows about Harry and
You-Know-Who.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Harry/Potter/Harry Potter</b></font>)</div><p/>Harry and Ron stared at her (<font color='blue'><b>Hermione</b></font>) with a mixture of amazement and admiration.
They had never heard Hermione speak to a teacher like that before.
Professor Trelawney chose not to reply. She (<font color='blue'><b>Hermione</b></font>) lowered her (<font color='blue'><b>Hermione</b></font>) huge eyes to
Harry's cup again and continued to turn it.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``The club... an attack. Dear, dear, this is not a happy cup...

<p/>I thought that was a bowler hat,''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>said Ron sheepishly.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``The skull... danger in your path, my dear...''

 (<font color='red'><b>Everyone</b></font>)</div><p/>Everyone was staring, transfixed, at Professor Trelawney, who gave the
cup a final turn, gasped, and then screamed.

<p/>There was another tinkle of breaking china; Neville had smashed his (<font color='blue'><b>Neville</b></font>)
second cup. Professor Trelawney sank into a vacant armchair, her (<font color='blue'><b>Hermione</b></font>)
glittering hand at her (<font color='blue'><b>Hermione</b></font>) heart and her (<font color='blue'><b>Hermione</b></font>) eyes closed.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``My dear boy... my poor, dear boy no it is kinder not to say.. . no...
don't ask me...''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``What is it, Professor?''  (<font color='red'><b>Dean Thomas/Dean</b></font>)</div>said Dean Thomas at once. Everyone had got to
their feet, and slowly they crowded around Harry and Ron's table,
pressing close to Professor Trelawney's chair to get a

<p/>good look at Harry's cup.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``My dear,''  (<font color='red'><b>Professor</b></font>)</div>Professor Trelawney's huge eyes opened dramatically,

<p/><div class="bookquote">``You have the Grim.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Trelawney/Sibyll/Sibyll Trelawney</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``The what?''  (<font color='red'><b>Harry/Potter/Harry Potter</b></font>)</div>said Harry.

<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) could tell that he (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) wasn't the only one who didn't understand; Dean
Thomas shrugged at him (<font color='blue'><b>Thomas</b></font>) and Lavender Brown looked puzzled, but nearly
everybody else clapped their hands to their mouths in horror.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``The Grim, my dear, the Grim!''  (<font color='red'><b>Professor</b></font>)</div>cried Professor Trelawney, who looked
shocked that Harry hadn't understood. <div class="bookquote">``The giant, spectral dog that
haunts churchyards! My dear boy, it is an omen -- the worst omen -- of
death!''

 (<font color='red'><b>Harry/Potter/Harry Potter</b></font>)</div><p/>Harry's stomach lurched. That dog on the cover of Death Omens in
Flourish and Blotts -the dog in the shadows of Magnolia Crescent...
Lavender Brown clapped her (<font color='blue'><b>Crescent</b></font>) hands to her (<font color='blue'><b>Crescent</b></font>) mouth too. Everyone was looking
at Harry, everyone except Hermione, who had gotten up and moved around
to the back of Professor Trelawney's chair.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``I don't think it looks like a Grim,''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Hermione</b></font>) said flatly.

<p/>Professor Trelawney surveyed Hermione with mounting dislike.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``You'll forgive me for saying so, my dear, but I perceive very little
aura around you. Very little receptivity to the resonances of the
future.''  (<font color='red'><b>Seamus Finnigan/Seamus</b></font>)</div>Seamus Finnigan was tilting his (<font color='blue'><b>Finnigan</b></font>) head from side to side.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``It looks like a Grim if you do this,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Finnigan</b></font>) said, with his (<font color='blue'><b>Finnigan</b></font>) eyes almost
shut, <div class="bookquote">``but it looks more like a donkey from here,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Finnigan</b></font>) said, leaning to
the left.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``When you've all finished deciding whether I'm going to die Or not!''
 (<font color='red'><b>Harry/Potter/Harry Potter</b></font>)</div>said Harry, taking even himself by surprise. Now nobody seemed to want
to look at him (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>).

<p/><div class="bookquote">``I think we will leave the lesson here for today,''  (<font color='red'><b>Professor</b></font>)</div>said Professor
Trelawney in her (<font color='blue'><b>Hermione</b></font>) mistiest voice. <div class="bookquote">``Yes... please pack away your
things...''

 (<font color='red'><b>Professor</b></font>)</div><p/>Silently the class took their teacups back to Professor Trelawney,
packed away their books, and closed their bags. Even Ron was avoiding
Harry's eyes.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Until we meet again,''  (<font color='red'><b>Professor</b></font>)</div>said Professor Trelawney faintly, <div class="bookquote">``fair fortune
be yours. Oh, and dear''  (<font color='red'><b>Trelawney/Sibyll/Sibyll Trelawney</b></font>)</div>-- she (<font color='blue'><b>Hermione</b></font>) pointed at Neville -- <div class="bookquote">``you'll be late
next time, so mind you work extra-hard to catch up.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Neville</b></font>)</div><p/>Harry, Ron, and Hermione descended Professor Trelawney's ladder and the
winding stair in silence, then set off for Professor McGonagall's
Transfiguration lesson. It took them so long to find her (<font color='blue'><b>Hermione</b></font>) classroom that,
early as they had left Divination, they were only just in time.

<p/>Harry chose a seat right at the back of the room, feeling as though he (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>)
were sitting in a very bright spotlight; the rest of the class kept
shooting furtive glances at him (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>), as though he (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) were about to drop dead at
any moment. He (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) hardly heard what Professor McGonagall was telling them
about Animagi -LRB-wizards who could transform at will into animals-RRB-, and
wasn't even watching when she (<font color='blue'><b>Hermione</b></font>) transformed herself in front of their eyes
into a tabby cat with spectacle markings around her (<font color='blue'><b>Hermione</b></font>) eyes.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Really, what has got into you all today?''  (<font color='red'><b>Professor</b></font>)</div>said Professor McGonagall,
turning back into herself with a faint pop, and staring around at them
all. <div class="bookquote">``Not that it matters, but that's the first time my transformation's
not got applause from a class.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Everybody</b></font>)</div><p/>Everybody's heads turned toward Harry again, but nobody spoke. Then
Hermione raised her (<font color='blue'><b>Hermione</b></font>) hand.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Please, Professor, we've just had our first Divination class, and we
were reading the tea leaves, and --''

 (<font color='red'><b>Professor</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Ah, of course,''  (<font color='red'><b>Professor</b></font>)</div>said Professor McGonagall, suddenly frowning.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``There is no need to say any more, Miss Granger. Tell me, which of you
will be dying this year?''

 (<font color='red'><b>Everyone</b></font>)</div><p/>Everyone stared at her (<font color='blue'><b>Hermione</b></font>).

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Me,''  (<font color='red'><b>Harry/Potter/Harry Potter</b></font>)</div>said Harry, finally.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``I see,''  (<font color='red'><b>Professor</b></font>)</div>said Professor McGonagall, fixing Harry with her (<font color='blue'><b>Hermione</b></font>) beady eyes.
<div class="bookquote">``Then you should know, Potter, that Sibyll Trelawney has predicted the
death of one student a year since she (<font color='blue'><b>Granger</b></font>) arrived at this school. None of
them has died yet. Seeing death omens is her (<font color='blue'><b>Granger</b></font>) favorite way of greeting a
new class. If it were not for the fact that I never speak ill of my
colleagues --''

 (<font color='red'><b>Professor</b></font>)</div><p/>Professor McGonagall broke off, and they saw that her (<font color='blue'><b>Hermione</b></font>) nostrils had gone
white. She (<font color='blue'><b>Hermione</b></font>) went on, more calmly, <div class="bookquote">``Divination is one of the most
imprecise branches of magic. I shall not conceal from you that I have
very little patience with it. True Seers are very rare, and Professor
Trelawney --''

 (<font color='red'><b>She</b></font>)</div><p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>Hermione</b></font>) stopped again, and then said, in a very matter-of-fact tone, <div class="bookquote">``You
look in excellent health to me, Potter, so you will excuse me if I don't
let you off homework today. I assure you that if you die, you need not
hand it in.''

 (<font color='red'><b>She</b></font>)</div><p/>Hermione laughed. Harry felt a bit better. It was harder to feel scared
of a lump of tea leaves away from the dim red light and befuddling
perfume of Professor Trelawney's classroom. Not everyone was convinced,
however. Ron still looked worried, and Lavender whispered, <div class="bookquote">``But what
about Neville's cup?''

 (<font color='red'><b>Ron</b></font>)</div><p/>When the Transfiguration class had finished, they joined the crowd
thundering toward the Great Hall for lunch.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Ron, cheer up,''  (<font color='red'><b>Hermione/HERMIONE</b></font>)</div>said Hermione, pushing a dish of stew toward him (<font color='blue'><b>Great</b></font>). <div class="bookquote">``You
heard what Professor McGonagall said.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Ron</b></font>)</div><p/>Ron spooned stew onto his (<font color='blue'><b>Ron</b></font>) plate and picked up his (<font color='blue'><b>Ron</b></font>) fork but didn't start.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Harry,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Ron</b></font>) said, in a low, serious voice, <div class="bookquote">``You haven't seen a great
black dog anywhere, have you?''

 (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Yeah, I have,''  (<font color='red'><b>Harry/Potter/Harry Potter</b></font>)</div>said Harry. <div class="bookquote">``I saw one the night I left the Dursleys'. ''

 (<font color='red'><b>Ron</b></font>)</div><p/>Ron let his (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) fork fall with a clatter.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Probably a stray,''  (<font color='red'><b>Hermione/HERMIONE</b></font>)</div>said Hermione calmly.

<p/>Ron looked at Hermione as though she (<font color='blue'><b>Hermione</b></font>) had gone mad.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Hermione, if Harry's seen a Grim, that's -- that's bad,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Ron</b></font>) said. <div class="bookquote">``My
-- my uncle Bilius saw one and -- and he (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) died twenty-four hours later!''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Coincidence,''  (<font color='red'><b>Hermione/HERMIONE</b></font>)</div>said Hermione airily, pouring herself some pumpkin juice.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``You don't know what you're talking about!''  (<font color='red'><b>Ron</b></font>)</div>said Ron, starting to get
angry. <div class="bookquote">``Grims scare the living daylights out of most wizards!''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``There you are, then,''  (<font color='red'><b>Hermione/HERMIONE</b></font>)</div>said Hermione in a superior tone. <div class="bookquote">``They see the
Grim and die of fright. The Grim's not an omen, it's the cause of death!
And Harry's still with us because he (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>)'s not stupid enough to see one and
think, right, well, I'd better kick the bucket then!''

 (<font color='red'><b>Ron</b></font>)</div><p/>Ron mouthed wordlessly at Hermione, who opened her (<font color='blue'><b>Hermione</b></font>) bag, took out her (<font color='blue'><b>Hermione</b></font>) new
Arithmancy book, and propped it open against the juice jug.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``I think Divination seems very woolly,''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Hermione</b></font>) said, searching for her (<font color='blue'><b>Hermione</b></font>)
page. <div class="bookquote">``A lot of guesswork, if you ask me.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``There was nothing woolly about the Grim in that cup!''  (<font color='red'><b>Ron</b></font>)</div>said Ron hotly.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``You didn't seem quite so confident when you were telling Harry it was a
sheep,''  (<font color='red'><b>Hermione/HERMIONE</b></font>)</div>said Hermione coolly.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Professor Trelawney said you didn't have the right aura! You just don't
like being bad at something for a change!''

 (<font color='red'><b>He</b></font>)</div><p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Ron</b></font>) had touched a nerve. Hermione slammed her (<font color='blue'><b>Hermione</b></font>) Arithmancy book down on the
table so hard that bits of meat and carrot flew everywhere.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``If being good at Divination means I have to pretend to see death omens
in a lump of tea leaves, I'm not sure I'll be studying it much longer!
That lesson was absolute rubbish compared with my Arithmancy class!''

 (<font color='red'><b>She</b></font>)</div><p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>Hermione</b></font>) snatched up her (<font color='blue'><b>Hermione</b></font>) bag and stalked away.

<p/>Ron frowned after her (<font color='blue'><b>Hermione</b></font>).

<p/><div class="bookquote">``What's she (<font color='blue'><b>You</b></font>) talking about?''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Ron</b></font>) said to Harry. <div class="bookquote">``She (<font color='blue'><b>You</b></font>) hasn't been to an
Arithmancy class yet.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Harry/Potter/Harry Potter</b></font>)</div><p/>Harry was pleased to get out of the castle after lunch. Yesterday's rain
had cleared; the sky was a clear, pale gray, and the grass was springy
and damp underfoot as they set off for their first ever Care of Magical
Creatures class.

<p/>Ron and Hermione weren't speaking to each other. Harry walked beside
them in silence as they went down the sloping lawns to Hagrid's hut on
the edge of the Forbidden Forest. It was only when he (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) spotted three
only-too- familiar backs ahead of them that he (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) realized they must be
having these lessons with the Slytherins. Malfoy was talking animatedly
to Crabbe and Goyle, who were chortling. Harry was quite sure he (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) knew
what they were talking about.

<p/>Hagrid was waiting for his (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) class at the door of his (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) hut. He (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) stood in his (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>)
moleskin overcoat, with Fang the boarhound at his (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) heels, looking
impatient to start.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``C'mon, now, get a move on!''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) called as the class approached. <div class="bookquote">``Got a
real treat for yeh today! Great lesson comin' up! Everyone here? Right,
follow me!''

 (<font color='red'><b>Harry/Potter/Harry Potter</b></font>)</div><p/>For one nasty moment, Harry thought that Hagrid was going to lead them
into the forest; Harry had had enough unpleasant experiences in there to
last him (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) a lifetime. However, Hagrid strolled off around the edge of the
trees, and five minutes later, they found themselves outside a kind of
paddock. There was nothing in there.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Everyone gather `round the fence here!''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) called. <div class="bookquote">``That's it -- make
sure yeh can see -- now, firs' thing yeh'll want ter do is open yer
books --''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``How?''  (<font color='red'><b>Draco</b></font>)</div>said the cold, drawling voice of Draco Malfoy.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Eh?''  (<font color='red'><b>Hagrid</b></font>)</div>said Hagrid.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``How do we open our books?''  (<font color='red'><b>Malfoy/Draco Malfoy/Draco</b></font>)</div>Malfoy repeated. He (<font color='blue'><b>Malfoy</b></font>) took out his (<font color='blue'><b>Malfoy</b></font>) copy of The
Monster Book of Monsters, which he (<font color='blue'><b>Malfoy</b></font>) had bound shut with a length of rope.
Other people took theirs out too; some, like Harry, had belted their
book shut; others had crammed them inside tight bags or clamped them
together with binder clips.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Hasn' -- hasn' anyone bin able ter open their books?''  (<font color='red'><b>Hagrid</b></font>)</div>said Hagrid,
looking crestfallen.

<p/>The class all shook their heads.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Yeh've got ter stroke 'em,''  (<font color='red'><b>Hagrid</b></font>)</div>said Hagrid, as though this was the most
obvious thing in the world. <div class="bookquote">``Look --''

 (<font color='red'><b>He</b></font>)</div><p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) took Hermione's copy and ripped off the Spellotape that bound it. The
book tried to bite, but Hagrid ran a giant forefinger down its spine,
and the book shivered, and then fell open and lay quiet in his (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) hand.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Oh, how silly we've all been!''  (<font color='red'><b>Malfoy/Draco Malfoy/Draco</b></font>)</div>Malfoy sneered. <div class="bookquote">``We should have stroked
them! why didn't we guess!''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I -- I thought they were funny,''  (<font color='red'><b>Hagrid</b></font>)</div>Hagrid said uncertainly to Hermione.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Oh, tremendously funny!''  (<font color='red'><b>Malfoy/Draco Malfoy/Draco</b></font>)</div>said Malfoy. <div class="bookquote">``Really witty, giving us books
that try and rip our hands off!''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Shut up, Malfoy,''  (<font color='red'><b>Harry/Potter/Harry Potter</b></font>)</div>said Harry quietly. Hagrid was looking downcast and
Harry wanted Hagrid's first lesson to be a success.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Righ' then,''  (<font color='red'><b>Hagrid</b></font>)</div>said Hagrid, who seemed to have lost his (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) thread, <div class="bookquote">``so -- so
yeh've got yer books an' -- an' - - now yeh need the Magical Creatures.
Yeah. So I'll go an' get 'em. Hang on... ''

 (<font color='red'><b>Hagrid</b></font>)</div><p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) strode away from them into the forest and out of sight.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``God, this place is going to the dogs,''  (<font color='red'><b>Malfoy/Draco Malfoy/Draco</b></font>)</div>said Malfoy loudly. ``That oaf
teaching classes, my father'll have a fit when I tell him (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>)

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Shut up, Malfoy,''  (<font color='red'><b>Harry/Potter/Harry Potter</b></font>)</div>Harry repeated.

<p/>``Careful, Potter, there's a dementor behind you

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Oooooooh!''  (<font color='red'><b>Lavender Brown</b></font>)</div>squealed Lavender Brown, pointing toward the opposite side
of the paddock.

<p/>Trotting toward them were a dozen of the most bizarre creatures Harry
had ever seen. They had the bodies, hind legs, and tails of horses, but
the front legs, wings, and heads of what seemed to be giant eagles, with
cruel, steel-colored beaks and large, brilliantly, orange eyes. The
talons on their front legs were half a foot long and deadly looking.
Each of the beasts had a thick leather collar around its neck, which was
attached to a long chain, and the ends of all of these were held in the
vast hands of Hagrid, who came jogging into the paddock behind the
creatures.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Gee up, there!''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>their</b></font>) roared, shaking the chains and urging the creatures
toward the fence where the class stood. Everyone drew back slightly as
Hagrid reached them and tethered the creatures to the fence.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Hippogriffs!''  (<font color='red'><b>Hagrid</b></font>)</div>Hagrid roared happily, waving a hand at them. <div class="bookquote">``Beau'iful,
aren' they?''

 (<font color='red'><b>Harry/Potter/Harry Potter</b></font>)</div><p/>Harry could sort of see what Hagrid meant. Once you got over the first
shock of seeing something that was, half horse, half bird, you started
to appreciate the hippogriffs' gleaming coats, changing smoothly from
feather to hair, each of them a different color: stormy gray, bronze,
pinkish roan, gleaming chestnut, and inky black.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``So,''  (<font color='red'><b>Hagrid</b></font>)</div>said Hagrid, rubbing his (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) hands together and beaming around, <div class="bookquote">``if
yeh wan' ter come a bit nearer --''

 (<font color='red'><b>Hagrid</b></font>)</div><p/>No one seemed to want to. Harry, Ron, and Hermione, however, approached
the fence cautiously.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Now, firs' thing yeh gotta know abou' hippogriffs is, they're proud,''
 (<font color='red'><b>Hagrid</b></font>)</div>said Hagrid. <div class="bookquote">``Easily offended, hippogriffs are. Don't never insult one,
'cause it might be the last thing yeh do.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Malfoy/Draco Malfoy/Draco</b></font>)</div><p/>Malfoy, Crabbe, and Goyle weren't listening; they were talking in an
undertone and Harry had a nasty feeling they were plotting how best to
disrupt the lesson.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Yeh always wait fer the hippogriff ter make the firs' move,''  (<font color='red'><b>Hagrid</b></font>)</div>Hagrid
continued. ``It's polite, see? Yeh walk toward him (<font color='blue'><b>they</b></font>), and yeh bow, an' yeh
wait. If he (<font color='blue'><b>they</b></font>) bows back, yeh're allowed ter touch him (<font color='blue'><b>they</b></font>). If he (<font color='blue'><b>they</b></font>) doesn' bow,
then get away from him (<font color='blue'><b>they</b></font>) sharpish, 'cause those talons hurt.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Right -- who wants ter go first?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/>Most of the class backed farther away in answer. Even Harry, Ron, and
Hermione had misgivings. The hippogriffs were tossing their fierce heads
and flexing their powerful wings; they didn't seem to like being
tethered like this.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``No one?''  (<font color='red'><b>Hagrid</b></font>)</div>said Hagrid, with a pleading look.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``I'll do it,''  (<font color='red'><b>Harry/Potter/Harry Potter</b></font>)</div>said Harry.

<p/>There was an intake of breath from behind him (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>), and both Lavender and
Parvati whispered, <div class="bookquote">``Oooh, no, Harry, remember your tea leaves!''

 (<font color='red'><b>Parvati/Parvati Patil</b></font>)</div><p/>Harry ignored them. He (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) climbed over the paddock fence.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Good man, Harry!''  (<font color='red'><b>Hagrid</b></font>)</div>roared Hagrid. <div class="bookquote">``Right then -- let's see how yeh get
on with Buckbeak.''

 (<font color='red'><b>He</b></font>)</div><p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) untied one of the chains, pulled the gray hippogriff away from its
fellows, and slipped off its leather collar. The class on the other side
of the paddock seemed to be holding its breath. Malfoy's eyes were
narrowed maliciously.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Easy-RRB- now, Harry,''  (<font color='red'><b>Hagrid</b></font>)</div>said Hagrid quietly. <div class="bookquote">``Yeh've got eye contact, now
try not ter blink... Hippogriffs don' trust yeh if yeh blink too
much...''

 (<font color='red'><b>Harry/Potter/Harry Potter</b></font>)</div><p/>Harry's eyes immediately began to water, but he (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) didn't shut thern.
Buckbeak had turned his (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) great, sharp head and was staring at Harry with
one fierce orange eye. <div class="bookquote">``Tha's it,''  (<font color='red'><b>Hagrid</b></font>)</div>said Hagrid. <div class="bookquote">``Tha's it, Harry... now,
bow.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Harry/Potter/Harry Potter</b></font>)</div><p/>Harry didn't feel much like exposing the back of his (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) neck to Buckbeak,
but he (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) did as he (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) was told. He (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) gave a short bow and then looked up.

<p/>The hippogriff was still staring haughtily at him (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>). It didn't move.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Ah,''  (<font color='red'><b>Hagrid</b></font>)</div>said Hagrid, sounding worried. ``Right -- back away, now, Harry,
easy does it

<p/>But then, to Harry's enormous surprise, the hippogriff suddenly bent its
scaly front knees and sank into what was an unmistakable bow.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Well done, Harry!''  (<font color='red'><b>Hagrid</b></font>)</div>said Hagrid, ecstatic. <div class="bookquote">``Right -- yeh can touch him (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>)!
Pat his (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) beak, go on!''

 (<font color='red'><b>Harry/Potter/Harry Potter</b></font>)</div><p/>Feeling that a better reward would have been to back away, Harry moved
slowly toward the hippogriff and reached out toward it. He (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) patted the
beak several times and the hippogriff closed its eyes lazily, as though
enjoying it.

<p/>The class broke into applause, all except for Malfoy, Crabbe, and Goyle,
who were looking deeply disappointed.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Righ' then, Harry,''  (<font color='red'><b>Hagrid</b></font>)</div>said Hagrid. <div class="bookquote">``I reckon he (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) might' let yeh ride him (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>)!''

 (<font color='red'><b>Harry/Potter/Harry Potter</b></font>)</div><p/>This was more than Harry had bargained for. He (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) was used to a broomstick;
but he (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) wasn't sure a hippogriff would be quite the same.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Yeh climb up there, jus' behind the wing joint,''  (<font color='red'><b>Hagrid</b></font>)</div>said Hagrid, <div class="bookquote">``an' mind
yeh don' pull any of his (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) feathers out, he (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) won' like that...''

 (<font color='red'><b>Hagrid</b></font>)</div><p/>Harry put his (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) foot on the top of Buckbeaks wing and hoisted himself onto
its back. Buckbeak stood up. Harry wasn't sure where to hold on;
everything in front of him (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) was covered with feathers.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Go on, then'''  (<font color='red'><b>Hagrid</b></font>)</div>roared Hagrid, slapping the hippogriffs hindquarters.

<p/>Without warning, twelve-foot wings flapped open on either side of Harry,
he (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) just had time to seize the hippogriff around the neck before he (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) was
soaring upward. It was nothing like a broomstick, and Harry knew which
one he (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) preferred; the hippogriff's wings beat uncomfortably on either
side of him (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>), catching him (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) under his (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) legs and making him (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) feel he (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) was
about to be thrown off; the glossy feathers slipped under his (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) fingers
and he (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) didn't dare get a stronger grip; instead of the smooth action of
his (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) Nimbus Two Thousand, he (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) now felt himself rocking backward and
forward as the hindquarters of the hippogriff rose and fell with its
wings.

<p/>Buckbeak flew him (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) once around the paddock and then headed back to the
ground; this was the bit Harry had been dreading; he (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) leaned back as the
smooth neck lowered, feeling he (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) was going to slip off over the beak,
then felt a heavy thud as the four ill-assorted feet hit the ground. He (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>)
just managed to hold on and push himself straight again.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Good work, Harry!''  (<font color='red'><b>Hagrid</b></font>)</div>roared Hagrid as everyone except Malfoy, Crabbe, and
Goyle cheered. <div class="bookquote">``Okay, who else wants a go?''

 (<font color='red'><b>Harry/Potter/Harry Potter</b></font>)</div><p/>Emboldened by Harry's success, the rest of the class climbed cautiously
into the paddock. Hagrid untied the hippogriffs one by one, and soon
people were bowing nervously, all over the paddock. Neville ran
repeatedly backward from his (<font color='blue'><b>Neville</b></font>), which didn't seem to want to bend its
knees. Ron and Hermione practiced on the chestnut, while Harry watched.

<p/>Malfoy, Crabbe, and Goyle had taken over Buckbeak. He (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) had bowed to
Malfoy, who was now patting his (<font color='blue'><b>Malfoy</b></font>) beak, looking disdainful.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``This is very easy,''  (<font color='red'><b>Malfoy/Draco Malfoy/Draco</b></font>)</div>Malfoy drawled, loud enough for Harry to, hear him (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>).
<div class="bookquote">``I knew it must have been, if Potter could do it... I bet you're not
dangerous at all, are you?''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) said to the hippogriff. <div class="bookquote">``Are you, you
great ugly brute?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/>It happened in a flash of steely talons; Malfoy let out a highpitched
scream and next moment, Hagrid was wrestling Buckbeak back into his (<font color='blue'><b>Malfoy</b></font>)
collar as he (<font color='blue'><b>Malfoy</b></font>) strained to get at Malfoy, who lay curled in the grass,
blood blossoming over his (<font color='blue'><b>Malfoy</b></font>) robes.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``I'm dying!''  (<font color='red'><b>Malfoy/Draco Malfoy/Draco</b></font>)</div>Malfoy yelled as the class panicked. <div class="bookquote">``I'm dying, look at
me! It's killed me!''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Yer not dyin'!''  (<font color='red'><b>Hagrid</b></font>)</div>said Hagrid, who had gone very white. <div class="bookquote">``Someone help me
-- gotta get him (<font color='blue'><b>Potter</b></font>) outta here --''

 (<font color='red'><b>Hermione/HERMIONE</b></font>)</div><p/>Hermione ran to hold open the gate as Hagrid lifted Malfoy easily. As
they passed, Harry saw that there was a long, deep gash on Malfoy's arm;
blood splattered the grass and Hagrid ran with him (<font color='blue'><b>Malfoy</b></font>), up the slope toward
the castle.

<p/>Very shaken, the Care of Magical Creatures class followed at a walk. The
Slytherins were all shouting about Hagrid.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``They should fire him (<font color='blue'><b>Potter</b></font>) straight away!''  (<font color='red'><b>Pansy/Pansy Parkinson</b></font>)</div>said Pansy Parkinson, who was in
tears.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``It was Malfoy's fault!''  (<font color='red'><b>Dean Thomas/Dean</b></font>)</div>snapped Dean Thomas. Crabbe and Goyle flexed
their muscles threateningly.

<p/>They all climbed the stone steps into the deserted entrance hall.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``I'm going to see if he (<font color='blue'><b>Malfoy</b></font>)'s okay!''  (<font color='red'><b>Pansy/Pansy Parkinson</b></font>)</div>said Pansy, and they all watched her (<font color='blue'><b>Pansy</b></font>)
run up the marble staircase. The Slytherins, still muttering about
Hagrid, headed away in the direction of their dungeon common room;
Harry, Ron, and Hermione proceeded upstairs to Gryffindor Tower.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``You think he (<font color='blue'><b>Malfoy</b></font>)'ll be all right?''  (<font color='red'><b>Hermione/HERMIONE</b></font>)</div>said Hermione nervously.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Course he (<font color='blue'><b>Malfoy</b></font>) will. Madam Pomfrey can mend cuts in about a second,''  (<font color='red'><b>Harry/Potter/Harry Potter</b></font>)</div>said
Harry, who had had far worse injuries mended magically by the nurse.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``That was a really bad thing to happen in Hagrid's first class, though,
wasn't it?''  (<font color='red'><b>Ron</b></font>)</div>said Ron, looking worried. <div class="bookquote">``Trust Malfoy to mess things up
for him (<font color='blue'><b>Malfoy</b></font>)...''

 (<font color='red'><b>Great</b></font>)</div><p/>They were among the first to reach the Great Hall at dinnertime, hoping
to see Hagrid, but he (<font color='blue'><b>Great</b></font>) wasn't there.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``They wouldn't fire him (<font color='blue'><b>Malfoy</b></font>), would they?''  (<font color='red'><b>Hermione/HERMIONE</b></font>)</div>said Hermione anxiously, not
touching her (<font color='blue'><b>Hermione</b></font>) steak-and- kidney pudding.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``They'd better not,''  (<font color='red'><b>Ron</b></font>)</div>said Ron, who wasn't eating either.

<p/>Harry was watching the Slytherin table. A large group including Crabbe
and Goyle was huddled together, deep in conversation. Harry was sure
they were cooking up their own version of how Malfoy had been injured.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Well, you can't say it wasn't an interesting first day back,''  (<font color='red'><b>Ron</b></font>)</div>said Ron
gloomily.

<p/>They went up to the crowded Gryffindor common room after dinner and
tried to do the homework Professor McGonagall had given them, but all
three of them kept breaking off and glancing Out of the tower window.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``There's a light on in Hagrid's window,''  (<font color='red'><b>Harry/Potter/Harry Potter</b></font>)</div>Harry said suddenly.

<p/>Ron looked at his (<font color='blue'><b>Ron</b></font>) watch.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``If we hurried, we could go down and see him (<font color='blue'><b>Malfoy</b></font>). It's still quite early...''

 (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div><p/>I don't know,'' Hermione said slowly, and Harry saw her (<font color='blue'><b>Hermione</b></font>) glance at him (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>).

<p/><div class="bookquote">``I'm allowed to walk across the grounds, ''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) said Pointedly. <div class="bookquote">``Sirius
Black hasn't got past the dementors yet, has he (<font color='blue'><b>Black</b></font>)?''

 (<font color='red'><b>nobody</b></font>)</div><p/>So they put their things away and headed out of the portrait hole, glad
to meet nobody on their way to the front doors, as they weren't entirely
sure they were supposed to be out.

<p/>The grass was still wet and looked almost black in the twilight. When
they reached Hagrid's hut, they knocked, and a voice growled, <div class="bookquote">``C'min.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Hagrid</b></font>)</div><p/>Hagrid was sitting in his (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) shirtsleeves at his (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) scrubbed wooden table; his (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>)
boarhound, Fang, had his (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) head in Hagrid's lap. One look told them that
Hagrid had been drinking a lot; there was a pewter tankard almost as big
as a bucket in front of him (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>), and he (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) seemed to be having difficulty
getting them into focus.

<p/><div class="bookquote">''`Spect it's a record,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) said thickly, when he (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) recognized them. <div class="bookquote">``Don'
reckon they've ever had a teacher who lasted on'y a day before.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``You haven't been fired, Hagrid!''  (<font color='red'><b>Hermione/HERMIONE</b></font>)</div>gasped Hermione.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Not yet,''  (<font color='red'><b>Hagrid</b></font>)</div>said Hagrid miserably, taking a huge gulp of whatever was in
the tankard. <div class="bookquote">``But's only a matter o' time, i' n't it, after Malfoy...''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``How is he (<font color='blue'><b>Malfoy</b></font>)?''  (<font color='red'><b>Ron</b></font>)</div>said Ron as they all sat down. <div class="bookquote">``It wasn't serious, was it?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Madam Pomfrey fixed him (<font color='blue'><b>Malfoy</b></font>) best she (<font color='blue'><b>Hagrid</b></font>) could,''  (<font color='red'><b>Hagrid</b></font>)</div>said Hagrid dully, ``but he (<font color='blue'><b>Malfoy</b></font>)'s
sayin' it's still agony... covered in bandages... moanin'..

<p/><div class="bookquote">``He (<font color='blue'><b>Malfoy</b></font>)'s faking it, ''  (<font color='red'><b>Harry/Potter/Harry Potter</b></font>)</div>said Harry at once. <div class="bookquote">``Madam Pomfrey can mend anything.
She (<font color='blue'><b>Hagrid</b></font>) regrew half my bones last year. Trust Malfoy to milk it for all it's
worth.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``School gov`nors have bin told, o' course,''  (<font color='red'><b>Hagrid</b></font>)</div>said Hagrid miseribly. <div class="bookquote">``They
reckon I started too big. Shoulda left hippogriffs fer later... done
flobberworms or summat... Jus' thought itdmake a good firs' lessons all
my fault...''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``It's all Malfoy's fault, Hagrid!''  (<font color='red'><b>Hermione/HERMIONE</b></font>)</div>said Hermione earnestly.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``We're witnesses,''  (<font color='red'><b>Harry/Potter/Harry Potter</b></font>)</div>said Harry. <div class="bookquote">``You said hippogriffs attack if you
insult them. It's Malfoy's problem that he (<font color='blue'><b>Malfoy</b></font>) wasn't listening. We'll tell
Dumbledore what really happened.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Yeah, don't worry, Hagrid, we'll back you up,''  (<font color='red'><b>Ron</b></font>)</div>said Ron.

<p/>Tears leaked out of the crinkled corners of Hagrid's beetle-black eyes.
He (<font color='blue'><b>Ron</b></font>) grabbed both Harry and Ron and pulled them into a bone-breaking hug.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``I think you've had enough to drink, Hagrid,''  (<font color='red'><b>Hermione/HERMIONE</b></font>)</div>said Hermione firmly. She (<font color='blue'><b>Hermione</b></font>)
took the tankard from the table and went outside to empty it.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``At, maybe she (<font color='blue'><b>them</b></font>)'s right,''  (<font color='red'><b>Hagrid</b></font>)</div>said Hagrid, letting go of Harry and Ron, who
both staggered away, rubbing their ribs. Hagrid heaved himself out of
his (<font color='blue'><b>Ron</b></font>) chair and followed Hermione unsteadily outside. They heard a loud
splash.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``What's he (<font color='blue'><b>Dumbledore</b></font>) done?''  (<font color='red'><b>Harry/Potter/Harry Potter</b></font>)</div>said Harry nervously as Hermione came back in with the
empty tankard.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Stuck his (<font color='blue'><b>Dumbledore</b></font>) head in the water barrel,''  (<font color='red'><b>Hermione/HERMIONE</b></font>)</div>said Hermione, putting the tankard
away.

<p/>Hagrid came back, his (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) long hair and beard sopping wet, wiping the water
out of his (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) eyes.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``That's better,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) said, shaking his (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) head like a dog and drenching them
all. ``Listen, it was good of yeh ter come an' see me, I really --

<p/>Hagrid stopped dead, staring at Harry as though he (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>)'d only just realized
he (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) was there.

<p/>``WHAT D``YEH THINK YOU<div class="bookquote">``RE DOIN', EH?''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) roared, so suddenly that they
jumped a foot in the air. <div class="bookquote">``YEH'RE NOT TO GO WANDERIN' AROUND AFTER DARK,
HARRY! AN, YOU TWO! LETTIN' HIM!''

 (<font color='red'><b>Hagrid</b></font>)</div><p/>Hagrid strode over to Harry, grabbed his (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) arm, and pulled him (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) to the
door.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``C'mon!''  (<font color='red'><b>Hagrid</b></font>)</div>Hagrid said angrily. <div class="bookquote">``I'm takin' yer all back up ter school,

 (<font color='red'><b>Malfoy/Draco Malfoy/Draco</b></font>)</div><p/>CHAPTER SEVEN

<p/>THE BOGGART IN THE WARDROBE

<p/>Malfoy didn't reappear in classes until late on Thursday morning, when
the Slytherins and Gryffindors were halfway through double Potions. He (<font color='blue'><b>Malfoy</b></font>)
swaggered into the dungeon, his (<font color='blue'><b>Malfoy</b></font>) right arm covered in bandages and bound
up in a sling, acting, in Harry's opinion, as though he (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) were the heroic
survivor of some dreadful battle.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``How is it, Draco?''  (<font color='red'><b>Pansy</b></font>)</div>simpered Pansy Parkinson. <div class="bookquote">``Does it hurt much?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Yeah,''  (<font color='red'><b>Malfoy/Draco Malfoy/Draco</b></font>)</div>said Malfoy, putting on a brave sort of grimace. But Harry saw
him (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) wink at Crabbe and Goyle when Pansy had looked away.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Settle down, settle down,''  (<font color='red'><b>Professor</b></font>)</div>said Professor Snape idly.

<p/>Harry and Ron scowled at each other; Snape wouldn't have said <div class="bookquote">``settle
down''  (<font color='red'><b>Snape/Severus/Severus Snape</b></font>)</div>if they'd walked in late, he (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>)'d have given them detention. But
Malfoy had always been able to get away with anything in Snape's
classes; Snape was head of Slytherin House, and generality favored his (<font color='blue'><b>Snape</b></font>)
own students above all others.

<p/>They were making a new potion today, a Shrinking Solution. Malfoy set up
his (<font color='blue'><b>Malfoy</b></font>) cauldron right next to Harry and Ron, so that they were preparing
their ingredients on the same table.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Sir,''  (<font color='red'><b>Malfoy/Draco Malfoy/Draco</b></font>)</div>Malfoy called, <div class="bookquote">``sir, I'll need help cutting up these daisy roots,
because of my arm --''

 (<font color='red'><b>Malfoy/Draco Malfoy/Draco</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Weasley, cut up Malfoy's roots for him (<font color='blue'><b>Malfoy</b></font>),''  (<font color='red'><b>Malfoy/Draco Malfoy/Draco</b></font>)</div>said Snape without looking up.

<p/>Ron went brick red.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``There's nothing wrong with your arm,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Ron</b></font>) hissed at Malfoy.

<p/>Malfoy smirked across the table.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Weasley, you heard Professor Snape; cut up these roots.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Ron</b></font>)</div><p/>Ron seized his (<font color='blue'><b>Ron</b></font>) knife, pulled Malfoy's roots toward him (<font color='blue'><b>Malfoy</b></font>), and began to
chop them roughly, so that they were all different sizes.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Professor,''  (<font color='red'><b>Malfoy/Draco Malfoy/Draco</b></font>)</div>drawled Malfoy, <div class="bookquote">``Weasley's mutilating my roots, sit.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Malfoy/Draco Malfoy/Draco</b></font>)</div><p/>Snape approached their table, stared down his (<font color='blue'><b>Snape</b></font>) hooked nose at the roots,
then gave Ron an unpleasant smile from beneath his (<font color='blue'><b>Ron</b></font>) long, greasy black
hair.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Change roots with Malfoy, Weasley.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``But, sit --!''

 (<font color='red'><b>Ron</b></font>)</div><p/>Ron had spent the last quarter of an hour carefully shredding his (<font color='blue'><b>Ron</b></font>) own
roots into exactly equal pieces.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Now,''  (<font color='red'><b>Snape/Severus/Severus Snape</b></font>)</div>said Snape in his (<font color='blue'><b>Snape</b></font>) most dangerous voice.

<p/>Ron shoved his (<font color='blue'><b>Ron</b></font>) own beautifully cut roots across the table a, Malfoy,
then took up the knife again.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``And, sir, I'll need this shrivelfig skinned,''  (<font color='red'><b>Malfoy/Draco Malfoy/Draco</b></font>)</div>said Malfoy, his (<font color='blue'><b>Malfoy</b></font>) voice
full of malicious laughter.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Potter, you can skin Malfoy's shrivelfig,''  (<font color='red'><b>Snape/Severus/Severus Snape</b></font>)</div>said Snape, giving Harry the
look of loathing he (<font color='blue'><b>Snape</b></font>) always reserved just for him (<font color='blue'><b>Snape</b></font>).

<p/>Harry took Malfoy's shrivelfig as Ron began trying to repair the damage
to the roots he (<font color='blue'><b>Ron</b></font>) now had to use. Harry skinned the shrivelfig as fast as
he (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) could and flung it back across the table at Malfoy without speaking.
Malfoy was smirking more broadly than ever.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Seen your pal Hagrid lately?''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Malfoy</b></font>) asked them quietly.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``None of your business,''  (<font color='red'><b>Ron</b></font>)</div>said Ron jerkily, without looking up.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``I'm afraid he (<font color='blue'><b>Malfoy</b></font>) won't be a teacher much longer,''  (<font color='red'><b>Malfoy/Draco Malfoy/Draco</b></font>)</div>said Malfoy in a tone of
mock sorrow. <div class="bookquote">``Father's not very happy about my injury --''

 (<font color='red'><b>Ron</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Keep talking, Malfoy, and I'll give you a real injury,''  (<font color='red'><b>Ron</b></font>)</div>snarled Ron.

<p/><div class="bookquote">''- he (<font color='blue'><b>Malfoy</b></font>)'s complained to the school governors. And to the Ministry of
Magic. Father's got a lot of influence, you know. And a lasting injury
like this''  (<font color='red'><b>Ron</b></font>)</div>-- he (<font color='blue'><b>Father</b></font>) gave a huge, fake sigh -- <div class="bookquote">``who knows if my arm'll ever
be the same again?''

 (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``So that's why you're putting it on,''  (<font color='red'><b>Harry/Potter/Harry Potter</b></font>)</div>said Harry, accidentally beheading
a dead caterpillar because his (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) hand was shaking in anger. <div class="bookquote">``To try to get
Hagrid fired.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Well,''  (<font color='red'><b>Malfoy/Draco Malfoy/Draco</b></font>)</div>said Malfoy, lowering his (<font color='blue'><b>Malfoy</b></font>) voice to a whisper, <div class="bookquote">``partly, Potter.
But there are other benefits too. Weasley, slice my caterpillars for
me.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Malfoy/Draco Malfoy/Draco</b></font>)</div><p/>A few cauldrons away, Neville was in trouble. Neville regularly went to
pieces in Potions lessons; it was his (<font color='blue'><b>Neville</b></font>) worst subject, and his (<font color='blue'><b>Neville</b></font>) great fear
of Professor Snape made things ten times worse. His (<font color='blue'><b>Snape</b></font>) potion, which was
supposed to be a bright, acid green, had turned --

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Orange, Longbottom,''  (<font color='red'><b>Snape/Severus/Severus Snape</b></font>)</div>said Snape, ladling some up and allowing to splash
back into the cauldron, so that everyone could see.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Orange. Tell me, boy, does anything penetrate that thick skull of
yours? Didn't you hear me say, quite clearly, that only one -tat spleen
was needed? Didn't I state plainly that a dash of leech juice would
suffice? What do I have to do to make you understand, Longbottom?''

 (<font color='red'><b>Neville/Neville Longbottom/Longbottom</b></font>)</div><p/>Neville was pink and trembling. He (<font color='blue'><b>Neville</b></font>) looked as though he (<font color='blue'><b>Neville</b></font>) was on the verge
of tears.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Please, sir,''  (<font color='red'><b>Hermione/HERMIONE</b></font>)</div>said Hermione, <div class="bookquote">``please, I could help Neville put it right
--''

 (<font color='red'><b>Hermione/HERMIONE</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I don't remember asking you to show off, Miss Granger,''  (<font color='red'><b>Hermione/HERMIONE</b></font>)</div>said Snape
coldly, and Hermione went as pink as Neville. <div class="bookquote">``Longbottom, at the end of
this lesson we will feed a few drops of this potion to your toad and see
what happens. Perhaps that will encourage you to do it properly.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Snape/Severus/Severus Snape</b></font>)</div><p/>Snape moved away, leaving Neville breathless with fear.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Help me!''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Neville</b></font>) moaned to Hermione.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Hey, Harry,''  (<font color='red'><b>Seamus Finnigan/Seamus</b></font>)</div>said Seamus Finnigan, leaning over to borrow Harry's brass
scales, <div class="bookquote">``have you heard? Daily Prophet this morning -- they reckon
Sirius Black's been sighted.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Harry/Potter/Harry Potter</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Where?''  (<font color='red'><b>Harry/Potter/Harry Potter</b></font>)</div>said Harry and Ron quickly. On the other side of the table,
Malfoy looked up, listening closely.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Not too far from here,''  (<font color='red'><b>Seamus Finnigan/Seamus</b></font>)</div>said Seamus, who looked excited. ``It was a
Muggle who saw him (<font color='blue'><b>Black</b></font>). <div class="bookquote">``Course, she (<font color='blue'><b>Granger</b></font>) didn't really understand. The Muggles
think he (<font color='blue'><b>Black</b></font>)'s just an ordinary criminal, don't they? So she (<font color='blue'><b>Granger</b></font>) phoned the
telephone hot line. By the time the Ministry of Magic got there, he (<font color='blue'><b>Black</b></font>) was
gone.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Not too far from here... ''  (<font color='red'><b>Ron</b></font>)</div>Ron repeated, looking significantly at
Harry. He (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) turned around and saw Malfoy watching closely. <div class="bookquote">``What, Malfoy?
Need something else skinned?''

 (<font color='red'><b>Malfoy/Draco Malfoy/Draco</b></font>)</div><p/>But Malfoy's eyes were shining malevolently, and they were fixed Harry.
He (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) leaned across the table.

<p/>Black single-handed, Potter?''

<p/>``Thinking Of trying to catch

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Yeah, that's right,''  (<font color='red'><b>Harry/Potter/Harry Potter</b></font>)</div>said Harry offhandedly.

<p/>Malfoys thin mouth was curving in a mean smile.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Of course, if it was me,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) said quietly, <div class="bookquote">``I'd have done something
before now. I wouldn't be staying in school like a good boy, I'd be out
there looking for him (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>).''

 (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``What are you talking about, Malfoy?''  (<font color='red'><b>Ron</b></font>)</div>said Ron roughly.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Don't you know, Potter?''  (<font color='red'><b>Malfoy/Draco Malfoy/Draco</b></font>)</div>breathed Malfoy, his (<font color='blue'><b>Malfoy</b></font>) pate eyes narrowed.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Know what?''

 (<font color='red'><b>Malfoy/Draco Malfoy/Draco</b></font>)</div><p/>Malfoy let out a low, sneering laugh.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Maybe you'd rather not risk your neck,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Malfoy</b></font>) said. <div class="bookquote">``Want to leave it to
the dementors, do you? But if it was me, I'd want revenge. I'd hunt him (<font color='blue'><b>Potter</b></font>)
down myself.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``What are you talking about?''  (<font color='red'><b>Harry/Potter/Harry Potter</b></font>)</div>said Harry angrily, but at that moment
Snape called, <div class="bookquote">``You should have finished adding your ingredients by now;
this potion needs to stew before it can be drunk, so clear away while it
simmers and then we'll test Longbottom's... ''

 (<font color='red'><b>Snape/Severus/Severus Snape</b></font>)</div><p/>Crabbe and Goyle laughed openly, watching Neville sweat as he (<font color='blue'><b>Neville</b></font>) stirred
his (<font color='blue'><b>Neville</b></font>) potion feverishly. Hermione was muttering instructions to him (<font color='blue'><b>Neville</b></font>) out of
the corner of her (<font color='blue'><b>Hermione</b></font>) mouth, so that Snape wouldn't see. Harry and Ron
packed away their unused ingredients and went to wash their hands and
ladles in the stone basin in the corner.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``What did Malfoy mean?''  (<font color='red'><b>Harry/Potter/Harry Potter</b></font>)</div>Harry muttered to Ron as he (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) stuck his (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) hands
under the icy jet that poured from the gargoyle's mouth ``Why would I
want revenge on Black? He (<font color='blue'><b>Malfoy</b></font>) hasn't done anything to me -- yet.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``He (<font color='blue'><b>Malfoy</b></font>)'s making it up,''  (<font color='red'><b>Ron</b></font>)</div>said Ron savagely. <div class="bookquote">``He (<font color='blue'><b>Malfoy</b></font>)'s trying to make you do
something stupid...''

 (<font color='red'><b>Snape/Severus/Severus Snape</b></font>)</div><p/>The end of the lesson in sight, Snape strode over to Neville, who was
cowering by his (<font color='blue'><b>Snape</b></font>) cauldron.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Everyone gather `round,''  (<font color='red'><b>Snape/Severus/Severus Snape</b></font>)</div>said Snape, his (<font color='blue'><b>Snape</b></font>) black eyes glittering, and
watch what happens to Longbottom's toad. If he (<font color='blue'><b>Longbottom</b></font>) has managed to produce a
Shrinking Solution, it will shrink to a tadpole. If, as I don't doubt,
he (<font color='blue'><b>Longbottom</b></font>) has done it wrong, his (<font color='blue'><b>Longbottom</b></font>) toad is likely to be poisoned.''

<p/>The Gryffindors watched fearfully. The Slytherins looked excited. Snape
picked up Trevor the toad in his (<font color='blue'><b>Snape</b></font>) left hand and dipped a small spoon into
Neville's potion, which was now green. He (<font color='blue'><b>Neville</b></font>) trickled a few drops down
Trevor's throat.

<p/>There was a moment of hushed silence, in which Trevor gulped; then there
was a small pop, and Trevor the tadpole was wriggling in Snape's palm.

<p/>The Gryffindors burst into applause. Snape, looking sour, pulled a small
bottle from the pocket of his (<font color='blue'><b>Snape</b></font>) robe, poured a few drops on top of Trevor,
and he (<font color='blue'><b>Trevor</b></font>) reappeared suddenly, fully grown.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Five points from Gryffindor,''  (<font color='red'><b>Snape/Severus/Severus Snape</b></font>)</div>said Snape, which wiped the smiles from
every face. <div class="bookquote">``I told you not to help him (<font color='blue'><b>Malfoy</b></font>), Miss Granger. Class dismissed.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Harry/Potter/Harry Potter</b></font>)</div><p/>Harry, Ron, and Hermione climbed the steps to the entrance hall. Harry
was still thinking about what Malfoy had said, while Ron was seething
about Snape.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Five points from Gryffindor because the potion was all right!

<p/>Why didn't You lie, Hermione? You should've said Neville did it all by
himself!''

 (<font color='red'><b>Hermione/HERMIONE</b></font>)</div><p/>Hermione didn't answer. Ron looked around.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Where is she (<font color='blue'><b>Hermione</b></font>)?''

 (<font color='red'><b>Harry/Potter/Harry Potter</b></font>)</div><p/>Harry turned too. They were at the top of the steps now, watching the
rest of the class pass them, heading for the Great Hall and lunch.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``She (<font color='blue'><b>Hermione</b></font>) was right behind us,''  (<font color='red'><b>Ron</b></font>)</div>said Ron, frowning.

<p/>Malfoy passed them, walking between Crabbe and Goyle. He (<font color='blue'><b>Ron</b></font>) smirked at
Harry and disappeared.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``There she (<font color='blue'><b>Hermione</b></font>) is,''  (<font color='red'><b>Harry/Potter/Harry Potter</b></font>)</div>said Harry.

<p/>Hermione was panting slightly, hurrying up the stairs; one hand clutched
her (<font color='blue'><b>Hermione</b></font>) bag, the other seemed to be tucking something down the front of her (<font color='blue'><b>Hermione</b></font>)
robes.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``How did you do that?''  (<font color='red'><b>Ron</b></font>)</div>said Ron.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``What?''  (<font color='red'><b>Hermione/HERMIONE</b></font>)</div>said Hermione, joining them.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``One minute you were right behind us, the next moment, you were back at
the bottom of the stairs again.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``What?''  (<font color='red'><b>Hermione/HERMIONE</b></font>)</div>Hermione looked slightly confused. <div class="bookquote">``Oh -- I had to go back for
something. Oh no --''

 (<font color='red'><b>Hermione/HERMIONE</b></font>)</div><p/>A seam had split on Hermione's bag. Harry wasn't surprised; he (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) could see
that it was crammed with at least a dozen large and heavy books.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Why are you carrying all these around with you?''  (<font color='red'><b>Ron</b></font>)</div>Ron asked her (<font color='blue'><b>Hermione</b></font>).

<p/><div class="bookquote">``You know how many subjects I'm taking,''  (<font color='red'><b>Hermione/HERMIONE</b></font>)</div>said Hermione breathlessly.
<div class="bookquote">``Couldn't hold these for me, could you?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``But --''  (<font color='red'><b>Ron</b></font>)</div>Ron was turning over the books she (<font color='blue'><b>Hermione</b></font>) had handed him (<font color='blue'><b>Ron</b></font>), looking at
the covers. <div class="bookquote">``You havent got any of these subjects today. It's only
Defense Against the Dark Arts this afternoon.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Oh yes,''  (<font color='red'><b>Hermione/HERMIONE</b></font>)</div>said Hermione vaguely, but she (<font color='blue'><b>Hermione</b></font>) packed all the books back into
her (<font color='blue'><b>Hermione</b></font>) bag just the same. I hope there's something good for lunch, I'm
starving,'' she (<font color='blue'><b>Hermione</b></font>) added, and she (<font color='blue'><b>Hermione</b></font>) marched off toward the Great Hall.

<p/>``D'you get the feeling Hermione's not telling us something?Ron asked
Harry.

<p/>Professor Lupin wasn't there when they arrived at his (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) first Defense
Against the Dark Arts lesson. They all sat down, took out their books,
quills, and parchment, and were talking when he (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) finally entered the
room. Lupin smiled vaguely and placed his (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) tatty old briefcase on the
teacher's desk. He (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) was as shabby as ever but looked healthier than he (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>)
had on the train, as though he (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) had had a few square meals.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Good afternoon,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Great</b></font>) said. <div class="bookquote">``Would you please put all your books back in
your bags. Today's will be a practical lesson. You will need only your
wands.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/>A few curious looks were exchanged as the class put away their books.
They had never had a practical Defense Against the Dark Arts before,
unless you counted the memorable class last year when their old teacher
had brought a cageful of pixies -to class and set them loose.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Right then,''  (<font color='red'><b>Professor</b></font>)</div>said Professor Lupin, when everyone was ready. <div class="bookquote">``If you'd
follow me.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Professor</b></font>)</div><p/>Puzzled but interested, the class got to its feet and followed Professor
Lupin out of the classroom. He (<font color='blue'><b>Professor</b></font>) led them along the deserted corridor and
around a corner, where the first thing they saw was Peeves the
Poltergeist, who was floating upside down in midair and stuffing the
nearest keyhole with chewing gum.

<p/>Peeves didn't look up until Professor Lupin was two feet away; ,hen he (<font color='blue'><b>Professor</b></font>)
wiggled his (<font color='blue'><b>Professor</b></font>) curly-toed feet and broke into song.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Loony, loopy Lupin,''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>Peeves sang. <div class="bookquote">``Loony, loopy Lupin, loony, loopy
Lupin --''

 (<font color='red'><b>Rude</b></font>)</div><p/>Rude and unmanageable as he (<font color='blue'><b>Rude</b></font>) almost always was, Peeves usually showed
some respect toward the teachers. Everyone looked quickly at Professor
Lupin to see how he (<font color='blue'><b>Professor</b></font>) would take this; to their surprise, he (<font color='blue'><b>Professor</b></font>) was still
smiling.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``I'd take that gum out of the keyhole if I were you, Peeves,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Professor</b></font>) said
pleasantly. <div class="bookquote">``Mr. Filch won't be able to get in to his (<font color='blue'><b>Filch</b></font>) brooms.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Hogwarts/Hogwarts Express</b></font>)</div><p/>Filch was the Hogwarts caretaker, a bad-tempered, failed wizard who
waged a constant war against the students and, indeed, Peeves. However,
Peeves paid no attention to Professor Lupin's words, except to blow a
loud wet raspberry.

<p/>Professor Lupin gave a small sigh and took out his (<font color='blue'><b>Professor</b></font>) wand.

<p/>``This is a useful little spell, he (<font color='blue'><b>Filch</b></font>) told the class over his (<font color='blue'><b>Filch</b></font>) shoulder.
<div class="bookquote">``Please watch closely.''

 (<font color='red'><b>He</b></font>)</div><p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Professor</b></font>) raised the wand to shoulder height, said, ``Waddiwasi! ``and pointed it
at Peeves.

<p/>With the force of a bullet, the wad of chewing gum shot out of the
keyhole and straight down Peeves's left nostril; he (<font color='blue'><b>Filch</b></font>) whirled upright and
zoomed away, cursing.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Cool, sit!''  (<font color='red'><b>Dean Thomas/Dean</b></font>)</div>said Dean Thomas in amazement.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Thank you, Dean,''  (<font color='red'><b>Professor</b></font>)</div>said Professor Lupin, putting his (<font color='blue'><b>Professor</b></font>) wand away again.
<div class="bookquote">``Shall we proceed?''

 (<font color='red'><b>Professor</b></font>)</div><p/>They set off again, the class looking at shabby Professor Lupin with
increased respect. He (<font color='blue'><b>Professor</b></font>) led them down a second corridor and stopped, right
outside the staffroom door.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Inside, please,''  (<font color='red'><b>Professor</b></font>)</div>said Professor Lupin, opening it and standing back.

<p/>The staffroom, a long, paneled room full of old, mismatched chairs, was
empty except for one teacher. Professor Snape was sitting in a low
armchair, and he (<font color='blue'><b>Professor</b></font>) looked around as the class filed in. His (<font color='blue'><b>Professor</b></font>) eyes were
glittering and there was a nasty sneer playing around his (<font color='blue'><b>Professor</b></font>) mouth. As
Professor Lupin came in and made to close the door behind him (<font color='blue'><b>Professor</b></font>), Snape
said, <div class="bookquote">``Leave it open, Lupin. I'd rather not witness this.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Snape/Severus/Severus Snape</b></font>)</div><p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Snape</b></font>) got to his (<font color='blue'><b>Snape</b></font>) feet and strode past the class, his (<font color='blue'><b>Snape</b></font>) black robes billowing
behind him (<font color='blue'><b>Snape</b></font>). At the doorway he (<font color='blue'><b>Snape</b></font>) turned on his (<font color='blue'><b>Snape</b></font>) heel and said, <div class="bookquote">``Possibly no
one's warned you, Lupin, but this class contains Neville Longbottom. I
would advise you not to entrust him (<font color='blue'><b>Longbottom</b></font>) with anything difficult. Not unless
Miss Granger is hissing instructions in his (<font color='blue'><b>Longbottom</b></font>) ear.''

 (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div><p/>Neville went scarlet. Harry glared at Snape; it was bad enough that he (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>)
bullied Neville in his (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) own classes, let alone doing it in front of other
teachers.

<p/>Professor Lupin had raised his (<font color='blue'><b>Professor</b></font>) eyebrows.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``I was hoping that Neville would assist me with the first stage of the
operation,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Professor</b></font>) said, <div class="bookquote">``and I am sure he (<font color='blue'><b>Neville</b></font>) will perform it admirably.''

 (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div><p/>Neville's face went, if possible, even redder. Snape's lip curled, but
he (<font color='blue'><b>Snape</b></font>) left, shutting the door with a snap.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Now, then,''  (<font color='red'><b>Professor</b></font>)</div>said Professor Lupin, beckoning the class toward the end of
the room, where there was nothing but an old wardrobe where the teachers
kept their spare robes. As Professor Lupin went to stand next to it, the
wardrobe gave a sudden wobble, banging off the wall.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Nothing to worry about,''  (<font color='red'><b>Professor</b></font>)</div>said Professor Lupin calmly because a few
people had jumped backward in alarm. <div class="bookquote">``There's a boggart in there.''

 (<font color='red'><b>people</b></font>)</div><p/>Most people seemed to feel that this was something to worry about.
Neville gave Professor Lupin a look of pure terror, and Seamus Finnigan
eyed the now rattling doorknob apprehensively.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Boggarts like dark, enclosed spaces,''  (<font color='red'><b>Professor</b></font>)</div>said Professor Lupin. ``Wardrobes,
the gap beneath beds, the cupboards under sinks -- I've even met one
that had lodged itself in a grandfather clock. This one moved in
yesterday afternoon, and I asked the headmaster if the staff would leave
it to give my third years some practice.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``So, the first question we must ask ourselves is, what is a boggart?''

 (<font color='red'><b>Hermione/HERMIONE</b></font>)</div><p/>Hermione put up her (<font color='blue'><b>Hermione</b></font>) hand.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``It's a shape-shifter,''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Hermione</b></font>) said. <div class="bookquote">``It can take the shape of whatever it
thinks will frighten us most.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Couldn't have put it better myself,''  (<font color='red'><b>Professor</b></font>)</div>said Professor Lupin, and Hermione
glowed. ``So the boggart sitting in the darkness within has not yet
assumed a form. He (<font color='blue'><b>headmaster</b></font>) does not yet know what will frighten the person on
the other side of the door. Nobody knows what a boggart looks like when
he (<font color='blue'><b>headmaster</b></font>) is alone, but when I let him (<font color='blue'><b>headmaster</b></font>) out, he (<font color='blue'><b>headmaster</b></font>) will immediately become whatever
each of us most fears.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``This means,''  (<font color='red'><b>Professor</b></font>)</div>said Professor Lupin, choosing to ignore Neville's `mall
sputter of terror, <div class="bookquote">``that we have a huge advantage over the boggart
before we begin. Have you spotted it, Harry?''

 (<font color='red'><b>Neville/Neville Longbottom/Longbottom</b></font>)</div><p/>Trying to answer a question with Hermione next to him (<font color='blue'><b>Neville</b></font>), bobbing up and
down on the balls of her (<font color='blue'><b>Hermione</b></font>) feet with her (<font color='blue'><b>Hermione</b></font>) hand in the air, was very
off-putting, but Harry had a go.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Er -- because there are so many of us, it won't know what shape it
should be?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Precisely,''  (<font color='red'><b>Professor</b></font>)</div>said Professor Lupin, and Hermione put her (<font color='blue'><b>Hermione</b></font>) hand down,
looking a little disappointed. ``It's always best to have com pany when
you're dealing with a boggart. He (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) becomes confused. Which should he (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>)
become, a headless corpse or a flesh-eating slug? I once saw a boggart
make that very mistake -- tried to frighten two people at once and
turned himself into half a slug. Not remotely frightening.

<p/>``The charm that repels a boggart is simple, yet it requires force of
mind. You see, the thing that really finishes a boggart is laughter.
What you need to do is force it to assume a shape that you find amusing.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``We will practice the charm without wands first. After me, please ...
Riddikulus!''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Riddikulus!''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>said the class together.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Good,''  (<font color='red'><b>Professor</b></font>)</div>said Professor Lupin. <div class="bookquote">``Very good. But that was the easy part,
I'm afraid. You see, the word alone is not enough. And this is where you
come in, Neville.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Neville/Neville Longbottom/Longbottom</b></font>)</div><p/>The wardrobe shook again, though not as much as Neville, who walked
forward as though he (<font color='blue'><b>Neville</b></font>) were heading for the gallows.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Right, Neville,''  (<font color='red'><b>Professor</b></font>)</div>said Professor Lupin. <div class="bookquote">``First things first: what would
you say is the thing that frightens you most in the world?''

 (<font color='red'><b>Neville/Neville Longbottom/Longbottom</b></font>)</div><p/>Neville's lips moved, but no noise came out.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``didn't catch that, Neville, sorry,''  (<font color='red'><b>Professor</b></font>)</div>said Professor Lupin cheerfully.

<p/>Neville looked around rather wildly, as though begging someone to help
him (<font color='blue'><b>Neville</b></font>), then said, in barely more than a whisper, <div class="bookquote">``Professor Snape.''

 (<font color='red'><b>him</b></font>)</div><p/>Nearly everyone laughed. Even Neville grinned apologetically. Professor
Lupin, however, looked thoughtful.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Professor Snape... hmmm... Neville, I believe you live with your
grandmother?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Er -- yes,''  (<font color='red'><b>Neville/Neville Longbottom/Longbottom</b></font>)</div>said Neville nervously. <div class="bookquote">``But -- I don't want the boggart to
turn into her (<font color='blue'><b>grandmother</b></font>) either.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``No, no, you misunderstand me,''  (<font color='red'><b>Professor</b></font>)</div>said Professor Lupin, now smiling. <div class="bookquote">``I
wonder, could you tell us what sort of clothes your grandmother usually
wears?''

 (<font color='red'><b>Neville/Neville Longbottom/Longbottom</b></font>)</div><p/>Neville looked startled, but said, <div class="bookquote">``Well... always the same hat. A tall
one with a stuffed vulture on top. And a long dress... green,
normally... and sometimes a fox-fur scarf.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Neville/Neville Longbottom/Longbottom</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``And a handbag?''  (<font color='red'><b>Professor</b></font>)</div>prompted Professor Lupin.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``A big red one,''  (<font color='red'><b>Neville/Neville Longbottom/Longbottom</b></font>)</div>said Neville.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Right then,''  (<font color='red'><b>Professor</b></font>)</div>said Professor Lupin. <div class="bookquote">``Can you picture those clothes very
clearly, Neville? Can you see them in your mind's eye?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Yes,''  (<font color='red'><b>Neville/Neville Longbottom/Longbottom</b></font>)</div>said Neville uncertainty, plainly wondering what was coming next.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``When the boggart bursts out of this wardrobe, Neville, and sees You, it
will assume the form of Professor Snape,''  (<font color='red'><b>Lupin/R. J. Lupin</b></font>)</div>said Lupin. ``And You will
raise your wand -- thus -- and cry <div class="bookquote">``Riddikulus' -- and concentrate hard
on your grandmother's clothes. If all goes well, Professor Boggart Snape
will be forced into that vulture-topped hat, and that green dress, with
that big red handbag.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/>There was a great shout of laughter. The wardrobe wobbled more
violently.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``If Neville is successful, the boggart is likely to shift his (<font color='blue'><b>Neville</b></font>) attention
to each of us in turn,''  (<font color='red'><b>Professor</b></font>)</div>said Professor Lupin. <div class="bookquote">``I would like all of you
to take a moment now to think of the thing that scares you most, and
imagine how you might force it to look comical...''

 (<font color='red'><b>Harry/Potter/Harry Potter</b></font>)</div><p/>The room went quiet. Harry thought... ``What scared him (<font color='blue'><b>Neville</b></font>) most in the
world?

<p/>His (<font color='blue'><b>Neville</b></font>) first thought was Lord Voldemort -- a Voldemort returned to full
strength. But before he (<font color='blue'><b>Voldemort</b></font>) had even started to plan a possible
counterattack on a boggart-Voldemort, a horrible image came floating to
the surface of his (<font color='blue'><b>Voldemort</b></font>) mind...

<p/>A rotting, glistening hand, slithering back beneath a black cloak ... a
long, rattling breath from an unseen mouth... then a cold so penetrating
it felt like drowning...

<p/>Harry shivered, then looked around, hoping no one had noticed. Many
people had their eyes shut tight. Ron was muttering to himself, <div class="bookquote">``Take
its legs off ''  (<font color='red'><b>Ron</b></font>)</div>Harry was sure he (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) knew what that was about. Ron's
greatest fear was spiders.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Everyone ready?''  (<font color='red'><b>Professor</b></font>)</div>said Professor Lupin.

<p/>Harry felt a lurch of fear. He (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) wasn't ready. How could you make a
dementor less frightening? But he (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) didn't want to ask for more time;
everyone else was nodding and rolling up their sleeves.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Neville, we're going to back away,''  (<font color='red'><b>Professor</b></font>)</div>said Professor Lupin. <div class="bookquote">``Let you have
a clear field, all right? I'll call the next person forward... Everyone
back, now, so Neville can get a clear shot --''

 (<font color='red'><b>Neville/Neville Longbottom/Longbottom</b></font>)</div><p/>They all retreated, backed against the walls, leaving Neville alone
beside the wardrobe. He (<font color='blue'><b>Neville</b></font>) looked pale and frightened, but he (<font color='blue'><b>Neville</b></font>) had pushed up
the sleeves of his (<font color='blue'><b>Neville</b></font>) robes and was holding his (<font color='blue'><b>Neville</b></font>) wand ready.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``On the count of three, Neville,''  (<font color='red'><b>Professor</b></font>)</div>said Professor Lupin, who was

<p/>pointing his (<font color='blue'><b>Professor</b></font>) own wand at the handle of the wardrobe. <div class="bookquote">``One two -- three
-- now!''

 (<font color='red'><b>Professor</b></font>)</div><p/>A jet of sparks shot from the end of Professor Lupin's wand and hit the
doorknob. The wardrobe burst open. Hook-nosed and menacing, Professor
Snape stepped out, his (<font color='blue'><b>Snape</b></font>) eyes flashing at Neville.

<p/>Neville backed away, his (<font color='blue'><b>Neville</b></font>) wand up, mouthing wordlessly. Snape was bearing
down upon him (<font color='blue'><b>Snape</b></font>), reaching inside his (<font color='blue'><b>Snape</b></font>) robes.

<p/>``R -- r -- riddikulus! ``squeaked Neville.

<p/>There was a noise like a whip crack. Snape stumbled; he (<font color='blue'><b>Snape</b></font>) was wearing a
long, lace-trimmed dress and a towering hat topped with a moth-eaten
vulture, and he (<font color='blue'><b>Snape</b></font>) was swinging a huge crimson handbag.

<p/>There was a roar of laughter; the boggart paused, confused, and
Professor Lupin shouted, <div class="bookquote">``Parvati! Forward!''

 (<font color='red'><b>Lupin/R. J. Lupin</b></font>)</div><p/>Parvati walked forward, her (<font color='blue'><b>Parvati</b></font>) face set. Snape rounded on her (<font color='blue'><b>Parvati</b></font>). There was
another crack, and where he (<font color='blue'><b>Snape</b></font>) had stood was a bloodstained, bandaged
mummy; its sightless face was turned to Parvati and it began to walk
toward her (<font color='blue'><b>Parvati</b></font>) very slowly, dragging its feet, its stiff arms rising --

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Riddikulus!''  (<font color='red'><b>Parvati</b></font>)</div>cried Parvati.

<p/>A bandage unraveled at the mummy's feet; it became entangled, fell face
forward, and its head rolled off.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Seamus!''  (<font color='red'><b>Professor</b></font>)</div>roared Professor Lupin.

<p/>Seamus darted past Parvati.

<p/>Crack! Where the mummy had been was a woman with floorlength black hair
and a skeletal, green-tinged face -- a banshee. She (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) opened her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) mouth
wide and an unearthly sound filled the room, a long, wailing shriek that
made the hair on Harry's head stand on end -- `Riddikulus!'' shouted
Seamus.

<p/>The banshee made a rasping noise and clutched her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) throat; her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) voice was
gone.

<p/>Crack! The banshee turned into a rat, which chased its tail in a circle,
then -- crack!- became a rattlesnake, which slithered and writhed before
-- crack! -- becoming a single, bloody eyeball.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``It's confused!''  (<font color='red'><b>Lupin</b></font>)</div>shouted Lupin. <div class="bookquote">``We're getting there! Dean!''

 (<font color='red'><b>Dean</b></font>)</div><p/>Dean hurried forward.

<p/>Crack! The eyeball became a severed hand, which flipped over and began
to creep along the floor like a crab.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Riddikulus!''  (<font color='red'><b>Dean</b></font>)</div>yelled Dean.

<p/>``There was a snap, and the hand was trapped in a mousetrap.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Excellent! Ron, you next!''

 (<font color='red'><b>Ron</b></font>)</div><p/>Ron leapt forward.

<p/>Crack!

<p/>Quite a few people screamed. A giant spider, six feet tall and covered
in hair, was advancing on Ron, clicking its pincers menacingly. For a
moment, Harry thought Ron had frozen. Then --

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Riddikulus!''  (<font color='red'><b>Ron</b></font>)</div>bellowed Ron, and the spider's legs vanished; it rolled
over and over; Lavender Brown squealed and ran out of its way and it
came to a halt at Harry's feet. He (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) raised his (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) wand, ready, but --

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Here!''  (<font color='red'><b>He</b></font>)</div>shouted Professor Lupin suddenly, hurrying forward. Crack!

<p/>The legless spider had vanished. For a second, everyone looked wildly
around to see where it was. Then they saw a silvery-white orb hanging in
the air in front of Lupin, who said, <div class="bookquote">``Riddikulus!''  (<font color='red'><b>Lupin</b></font>)</div>almosi lazily.

<p/>Crack!

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Forward, Neville, and finish him (<font color='blue'><b>Neville</b></font>) off!''  (<font color='red'><b>Lupin/R. J. Lupin</b></font>)</div>said Lupin as the boggart landed
on the floor as a cockroach. Crack! Snape was back. This time Neville
charged forward looking determined.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Riddikulus!''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Neville</b></font>) shouted, and they had a split second's view of Snape in
his (<font color='blue'><b>Snape</b></font>) lacy dress before Neville let out a great <div class="bookquote">``Ha!''  (<font color='red'><b>Neville/Neville Longbottom/Longbottom</b></font>)</div>of laughter, and the
boggart exploded, burst into a thousand tiny wisps of smoke, and was
gone.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Excellent!''  (<font color='red'><b>Professor</b></font>)</div>cried Professor Lupin as the class broke into applause.
<div class="bookquote">``Excellent-RRB- Neville. Well done, everyone... Let me See... five points
to Gryffindor for every person to tackle the boggart -- ten for Neville
because he (<font color='blue'><b>Neville</b></font>) did it twice... and five each to Hermione and Harry.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``But I didn't do anything,''  (<font color='red'><b>Harry/Potter/Harry Potter</b></font>)</div>said Harry.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``You and Hermione answered my questions correctly at the start of the
class, Harry,''  (<font color='red'><b>Lupin/R. J. Lupin</b></font>)</div>Lupin said lightly. <div class="bookquote">``Very well, everyone, an excellent
lesson. Homework, kindly read the chapter on boggarts and summarize it
for me... to be handed in on Monday. That will be all.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/>Talking excitedly, the class left the staffroom. Harry, however, wasn't
feeling cheerful. Professor Lupin had deliberately stopped him (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) from
tackling the boggart. Why? Was it because he (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>)'d seen Harry collapse on
the train, and thought he (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) wasn't up to much? Had he (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) thought Harry would
pass out again?

<p/>But no one else seemed to have noticed anything.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Did you see me take that banshee?''  (<font color='red'><b>Seamus Finnigan/Seamus</b></font>)</div>shouted Seamus. <div class="bookquote">``And the hand!''  (<font color='red'><b>Dean Thomas/Dean</b></font>)</div>said
Dean, waving his (<font color='blue'><b>Dean</b></font>) own around.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``And Snape in that hat!''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``And my mummy!''

 (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div><p/>I wonder why Professor Lupin's frightened of crystal balls?'' said
Lavender thoughtfully.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``That was the best Defense Against the Dark Arts lesson we've ever had,
wasn't it?''  (<font color='red'><b>Ron</b></font>)</div>said Ron excitedly as they made their way back to the
classroom to get their bags.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``He (<font color='blue'><b>Snape</b></font>) seems like a very good teacher,''  (<font color='red'><b>Hermione/HERMIONE</b></font>)</div>said Hermione approvingly. <div class="bookquote">``But I
wish I could have had a turn with the boggart --''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``What would it have been for you?''  (<font color='red'><b>Ron</b></font>)</div>said Ron, sniggering. <div class="bookquote">``A piece of
homework that only got nine out of ten?''

 (<font color='red'><b>people</b></font>)</div><p/>CHAPTER EIGHT

<p/>FLIGHT OF THE FAT FADY

<p/>In no time at all, Defense Against the Dark Arts had become most
people's favorite class. Only Draco Malfoy and his (<font color='blue'><b>Malfoy</b></font>) gang of Slytherins
had anything bad to say about Professor Lupin.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Look at the state of his (<font color='blue'><b>Snape</b></font>) robes,''  (<font color='red'><b>Malfoy/Draco Malfoy/Draco</b></font>)</div>Malfoy would say in a loud whisper as
Professor Lupin passed. <div class="bookquote">``He (<font color='blue'><b>Snape</b></font>) dresses like our old houseelf ''
 (<font color='red'><b>Professor</b></font>)</div>*****
But no one else cared that Professor Lupin's robes were patched and
frayed. His (<font color='blue'><b>Professor</b></font>) next few lessons were just as interesting as the first.
After boggarts, they studied Red Caps, nasty little goblin like
creatures that lurked wherever there had been bloodshed: in the dungeons
of castles and the potholes of deserted battlefields, waiting to
bludgeon those who had gotten lost. From Red Caps they moved on to
kappas, creepy. water-dwellers that looked like scaly monkeys, with
webbed hands itching to strangle unwitting waders in their ponds.

<p/>Harry only wished he (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) was as happy with some of his (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) other classes. Worst
of all was Potions. Snape was in a particularly vindictive mood these
days, and no one was in any doubt why. The story of the boggart assuming
Snape's shape, and the way that Neville had dressed it in his (<font color='blue'><b>Neville</b></font>)
grandmother's clothes, had traveled through the school like wildfire.
Snape didn't seem to find it funny. His (<font color='blue'><b>Snape</b></font>) eyes flashed menacingly at the
very mention of Professor Lupin's name, and he (<font color='blue'><b>Professor</b></font>) was bullying Neville
worse than ever.

<p/>Harry was also growing to dread the hours he (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) spent in Professor
Trelawney's stifling tower room, deciphering lopsided shapes and
symbols, trying to ignore the way Professor Trelawney's enormous eyes
filled with tears every time she (<font color='blue'><b>grandmother</b></font>) looked at him (<font color='blue'><b>Professor</b></font>). He (<font color='blue'><b>Professor</b></font>) couldn't like
Professer Trelawney, even though she (<font color='blue'><b>grandmother</b></font>) was treated with respect bordering
on reverence by many of the class. Parvati Patil and Lavender Brown had
taken to haunting Professor Trelawney's tower room at lunch times, and
always returned with annoyingly superior looks on their faces, as though
they knew things the others didn't. They had also started using hushed
voices whenever they spoke to Harry, as though he (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) were on his (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) deathbed.

<p/>Nobody really liked Care of Magical Creatures, which, after the
action-packed first class, had become extremely dull. Hagrid seemed to
have lost his (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) confidence. They were now spending lesson after lesson
learning how to look after flobberworms, which had to be some of the
most boring creatures in existence.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Why would anyone bother looking after them?''  (<font color='red'><b>Ron</b></font>)</div>said Ron, after yet
another hour of poking shredded lettuce down the flobberworms' throats.

<p/>At the start of October, however, Harry had something else to occupy
him (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>), something so enjoyable it more than made up for his (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) unsatisfactory
classes. The Quidditch season was approaching, and O1iver Wood, Captain
of the Gryffindor team, called a meeting on Thursday evening to discuss
tactics for the new season.

<p/>There were seven people on a Quidditch team: three Chasers, whose job it
was to score goals by putting the Quaffle -LRB-a red, soccer-sized ball-RRB-
through one of the fifty-foot-high hoops at each

<p/>end of the field; two Beaters, who were equipped with heavy bats to
repel the Bludgers -LRB-two heavy black balls that zoomed around trying to
attack the players-RRB-; a Keeper, who defended the goal

<p/>posts, and the Seeker, who had the hardest job of all, that of catching
the Golden Snitch, a tiny, winged, walnut-sized ball, whose capture
ended the game and earned the Seeker's team an extra one hundred and
fifty points.

<p/>Oliver Wood was a burly seventeen-year-old, now in his (<font color='blue'><b>Wood</b></font>) seventh and final
year at Hogwarts. There was a quiet sort of desperation in his (<font color='blue'><b>Wood</b></font>) voice a's
he (<font color='blue'><b>Wood</b></font>) addressed his (<font color='blue'><b>Wood</b></font>) six fellow team members in the chilly locker rooms on
the edge of the darkening Quidditch field.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``This is our last chance -- my last chance -- to win the Quidditch Cup,''
 (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Wood</b></font>) told them, striding up and down in front of them. <div class="bookquote">``I'll be leaving at
the end of this year. I'll never get another shot at it.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/>``Gryffindor hasn't won for seven years now. Okay, so we've had the worst
luck in the world -- injuries -- then the tournamentgetting called off
last year Wood swallowed, as though the memory still brought a lump to
his (<font color='blue'><b>Wood</b></font>) throat. ``But we also know we've got the
best-ruddy-team-in-the-school,'' he (<font color='blue'><b>Wood</b></font>) said, punching a fist into his (<font color='blue'><b>Wood</b></font>) other
hand, the old manic glint back in his (<font color='blue'><b>Wood</b></font>) eye. <div class="bookquote">``We've got three superb
Chasers.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Wood</b></font>)</div><p/>Wood pointed at Alicia Spinner, Angelina Johnson, and Katie Bell.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``We've got two unbeatable Beaters.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Stop it, Oliver, you're embarrassing us,''  (<font color='red'><b>Fred/Fred Weasley</b></font>)</div>said Fred and George Weasley
together, pretending to blush.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``And we've got a Seeker who has never failed to win us a match!''  (<font color='red'><b>Wood</b></font>)</div>Wood
rumbled, glaring at Harry with a kind of furious pride. <div class="bookquote">``And me,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Wood</b></font>)
added as an afterthought.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``We think you're very good too, Oliver,''  (<font color='red'><b>George/George Weasley/Weasley</b></font>)</div>said George.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Spanking good Keeper,''  (<font color='red'><b>Fred/Fred Weasley</b></font>)</div>said Fred.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``The point is,''  (<font color='red'><b>Wood/Oliver/Oliver Wood</b></font>)</div>Wood went on, resuming his (<font color='blue'><b>Wood</b></font>) pacing, <div class="bookquote">``the Quidditch Cup
should have had our name on it these last two years. Ever since Harry
joined the team, I've thought the thing was in the bag. But we haven't
got it, and this year's the last chance we'll get to finally see our
name on the thing...''

 (<font color='red'><b>Wood/Oliver/Oliver Wood</b></font>)</div><p/>Wood spoke so dejectedly that even Fred and George looked sympathetic.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Oliver, this year's our year,''  (<font color='red'><b>Fred/Fred Weasley</b></font>)</div>said Fred.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``We'll do it, Oliver!''  (<font color='red'><b>Angelina</b></font>)</div>said Angelina.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Definitely,''  (<font color='red'><b>Harry/Potter/Harry Potter</b></font>)</div>said Harry.

<p/>Full of determination, the team started training sessions, three
evenings a week. The weather was getting colder and wetter, the nights
darker, but no amount of mud, wind, or rain could tarnish Harry's
wonderful vision of finally winning the huge, silver Quidditch Cup.

<p/>Harry returned to the Gryffindor common room one evening after training,
cold and stiff but pleased with the way practice had gone, to find the
room buzzing excitedly.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``What's happened?'' (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>, he (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) asked Ron and Hermione, who were sitting in two
of the best chairs by the fireside and completing some star charts for
Astronomy.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``First Hogsmeade weekend,''  (<font color='red'><b>Ron</b></font>)</div>said Ron, pointing at a notice that had
appeared on the battered old bulletin board. <div class="bookquote">``End of October.
Halloween.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Excellent,''  (<font color='red'><b>Fred/Fred Weasley</b></font>)</div>said Fred, who had followed Harry through the portrait
hole. <div class="bookquote">``I need to visit Zonko's. I'm nearly out of Stink Pellets.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Harry/Potter/Harry Potter</b></font>)</div><p/>Harry threw himself into a chair beside Ron, his (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) high spirits ebbing
away. Hermione seemed to read his (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) mind.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Harry, I'm sure you'll be able to go next time,''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Hermione</b></font>) said. <div class="bookquote">``They're
bound to catch Black soon. He (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>)'s been sighted once already.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Black's not fool enough to try anything in Hogsmeade,''  (<font color='red'><b>Ron</b></font>)</div>said Ron. <div class="bookquote">``Ask
McGonagall if you can go this time, Harry. The next one might not be for
ages --''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Ron!''  (<font color='red'><b>Hermione/HERMIONE</b></font>)</div>said Hermione. <div class="bookquote">``Harry's supposed to stay in school-''

 (<font color='red'><b>Ron</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``He (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) can't be the only third year left behind,''  (<font color='red'><b>Ron</b></font>)</div>said Ron. <div class="bookquote">``Ask
McGonagall, go on, Harry --''

 (<font color='red'><b>Harry/Potter/Harry Potter</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Yeah, I think I will,''  (<font color='red'><b>Harry/Potter/Harry Potter</b></font>)</div>said Harry, making up his (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) mind.

<p/>Hermione opened her (<font color='blue'><b>Hermione</b></font>) mouth to argue, but at that moment Crookshanks leapt
lightly onto her (<font color='blue'><b>Hermione</b></font>) lap. A large, dead spider was dangling from his (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) mouth.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Does he (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) have to eat that in front of us?''  (<font color='red'><b>Ron</b></font>)</div>said Ron, scowling.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Clever Crookshanks, did you catch that all by yourself?''  (<font color='red'><b>Hermione/HERMIONE</b></font>)</div>said Hermione.

<p/>Crookshanks; slowly chewed up the spider, his (<font color='blue'><b>Ron</b></font>) yellow eyes fixed
insolently on Ron.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Just keep him (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) over there, that's all,''  (<font color='red'><b>Ron</b></font>)</div>said Ron irritably, turning back
to his (<font color='blue'><b>Ron</b></font>) star chart. <div class="bookquote">``1've got Scabbers asleep in my bag.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Harry/Potter/Harry Potter</b></font>)</div><p/>Harry yawned. He (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) really wanted to go to bed, but he (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) still had his (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) own
star chart to complete. He (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) pulled his (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) bag toward him (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>), took out
parchment, ink, and quill, and started work.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``You can copy mine, if you like,''  (<font color='red'><b>Ron</b></font>)</div>said Ron, labeling his (<font color='blue'><b>Ron</b></font>) last star with
a flourish and shoving the chart toward Harry.

<p/>Hermione, who disapproved of copying, pursed her (<font color='blue'><b>Hermione</b></font>) lips but didn't say
anything. Crookshanks was still staring unblinkingly at Ron, flicking
the end of his (<font color='blue'><b>Ron</b></font>) bushy tail. Then, without warning, he (<font color='blue'><b>Ron</b></font>) pounced.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``OY!''  (<font color='red'><b>Ron</b></font>)</div>Ron roared, seizing his (<font color='blue'><b>Ron</b></font>) bag as Crookshanks sank four sets of claws
deep inside it and began tearing ferociously. <div class="bookquote">``GET OFF, YOU STUPID
ANIMAL!''

 (<font color='red'><b>Ron</b></font>)</div><p/>Ron tried to pull the bag away from Crookshanks, but Crookshanks clung
on, spitting and slashing.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Ron, don't hurt him (<font color='blue'><b>Ron</b></font>)!''  (<font color='red'><b>Hermione/HERMIONE</b></font>)</div>squealed Hermione; the whole common room was
watching; Ron whirled the bag around, Crookshanks still clinging to it,
and Scabbers came flying out of the top -

<p/>``CATCH THAT CAR' Ron yelled as Crookshanks freed himself from the
remnants of the bag, sprang over the table, and chased after the
terrified Scabbers.

<p/>George Weasley made a lunge for Crookshanks but missed; Scabbers
streaked through twenty pairs of legs and shot beneath an old chest of
drawers. Crookshanks skidded to a halt, crouched low on his (<font color='blue'><b>Weasley</b></font>) bandy legs,
and started making furious swipes beneath it with his (<font color='blue'><b>Weasley</b></font>) front paw.

<p/>Ron and Hermione hurried over; Hermione grabbed Crookshanks around the
middle and heaved him (<font color='blue'><b>Ron</b></font>) away; Ron threw himself onto his (<font color='blue'><b>Ron</b></font>) stomach and, with
great difficulty, pulled Scabbers out by the tail.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Look at him (<font color='blue'><b>Ron</b></font>)!''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Ron</b></font>) said furiously to Hermione, dangling Scabbers in front
of her (<font color='blue'><b>Hermione</b></font>). <div class="bookquote">``He (<font color='blue'><b>Ron</b></font>)'s skin and bone! You keep that cat away from him (<font color='blue'><b>Ron</b></font>)!''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Crookshanks doesn't understand it's wrong!''  (<font color='red'><b>Hermione/HERMIONE</b></font>)</div>said Hermione, her (<font color='blue'><b>Hermione</b></font>) voice
shaking. <div class="bookquote">``All cats chase rats, Ron!''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``There's something funny about that animal!''  (<font color='red'><b>Ron</b></font>)</div>said Ron, who was trying to
persuade a frantically wiggling Scabbers back into his (<font color='blue'><b>Ron</b></font>) pocket. <div class="bookquote">``It heard
me say that Scabbers was in my bag!''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Oh, what rubbish,''  (<font color='red'><b>Hermione/HERMIONE</b></font>)</div>said Hermione impatiently. <div class="bookquote">``Crookshanks could smell
him (<font color='blue'><b>Ron</b></font>), Ron, how else d'you think --''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``That cat's got it in for Scabbers!''  (<font color='red'><b>Ron</b></font>)</div>said Ron, `ignoring the people
around him (<font color='blue'><b>Ron</b></font>), who were starting to giggle. <div class="bookquote">``And Scabbers was here first,
and he (<font color='blue'><b>Ron</b></font>)'s ill!''

 (<font color='red'><b>Ron</b></font>)</div><p/>Ron marched through the common room and out of sight up the stairs to
the boys' dormitories.

<p/>Ron was still in a bad mood with Hermione next day. He (<font color='blue'><b>Ron</b></font>) barely talked to
her (<font color='blue'><b>Hermione</b></font>) all through Herbology, even though he (<font color='blue'><b>Ron</b></font>), Harry, and Hermione were
working together on the same puffapod.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``How's Scabbers?''  (<font color='red'><b>Hermione/HERMIONE</b></font>)</div>Hermione asked timidly as they stripped fat pink pods
from the plants and emptied the shining beans into a wooden pail.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``He (<font color='blue'><b>Ron</b></font>)'s hiding at the bottom of my bed, shaking, ''  (<font color='red'><b>Ron</b></font>)</div>said Ron angrily,
missing the pail and scattering beans over the greenhouse floor.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Careful, Weasley, careful!''  (<font color='red'><b>Professor</b></font>)</div>cried Professor Sprout as the beans burst
into bloom before their very eyes.

<p/>They had Transfiguration next. Harry, who had resolved to ask Professor
McGonagall after the lesson whether he (<font color='blue'><b>Professor</b></font>) could go into Hogsmeade with the
rest, joined the line outside the class trying to decide how he (<font color='blue'><b>Professor</b></font>) was
going to argue his (<font color='blue'><b>Professor</b></font>) case. He (<font color='blue'><b>Professor</b></font>) was distracted, however, by a disturbance at
the front of the line.

<p/>Lavender Brown seemed to be crying. Parvati had her (<font color='blue'><b>Parvati</b></font>) arm around her (<font color='blue'><b>Parvati</b></font>) and
was explaining something to Seamus Finnigan and Dean Thomas, who were
looking very serious.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``What's the matter, Lavender?''  (<font color='red'><b>Hermione/HERMIONE</b></font>)</div>said Hermione anxiously as she (<font color='blue'><b>Hermione</b></font>), Harry,
and Ron went to join the group.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``She (<font color='blue'><b>Scabbers</b></font>) got a letter from home this morning,''  (<font color='red'><b>Parvati</b></font>)</div>Parvati whispered. <div class="bookquote">``It's her (<font color='blue'><b>Scabbers</b></font>)
rabbit, Binky. He (<font color='blue'><b>Weasley</b></font>)'s been killed by a fox.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Oh,''  (<font color='red'><b>Hermione/HERMIONE</b></font>)</div>said Hermione, <div class="bookquote">``I'm sorry, Lavender.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Hermione/HERMIONE</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I should have known!''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>said Lavender tragically. <div class="bookquote">``You know what day it
is?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Er --''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/>``The sixteenth of October! ``That thing you're dreading, it will happen
on the sixteenth of October!<div class="bookquote">'' Remember? She (<font color='blue'><b>Hermione</b></font>) was right, she (<font color='blue'><b>Hermione</b></font>) was right!''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/>The whole class was gathered around Lavender now. Seamus shook his (<font color='blue'><b>Seamus</b></font>) head
seriously. Hermione hesitated; then she (<font color='blue'><b>Hermione</b></font>) said, <div class="bookquote">``You -- you were dreading
Binky being killed by a fox?''

 (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Well, not necessarily by a fox,''  (<font color='red'><b>Hermione</b></font>)</div>said Lavender, looking up at Hermione
with streaming eyes, <div class="bookquote">``but I was obviously dreading him (<font color='blue'><b>fox</b></font>) dying, wasn't l?''

 (<font color='red'><b>Hermione</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Oh,''  (<font color='red'><b>Hermione/HERMIONE</b></font>)</div>said Hermione. She (<font color='blue'><b>Hermione</b></font>) paused again. Then

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Was Binky an old rabbit?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``N -- no!''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>sobbed Lavender. <div class="bookquote">``H -- he (<font color='blue'><b>fox</b></font>) was only a baby!''

 (<font color='red'><b>Parvati/Parvati Patil</b></font>)</div><p/>Parvati tightened her (<font color='blue'><b>Hermione</b></font>) arm around Lavender's shoulders.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``But then, why would you dread him (<font color='blue'><b>fox</b></font>) dying?''  (<font color='red'><b>Hermione/HERMIONE</b></font>)</div>said Hermione.

<p/>Parvati glared at her (<font color='blue'><b>Hermione</b></font>).

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Well, look at it logically,''  (<font color='red'><b>Hermione/HERMIONE</b></font>)</div>said Hermione, turning to the rest of the
group- <div class="bookquote">``I mean, Binky didn't even die today, did he (<font color='blue'><b>fox</b></font>)? Lavender just got
the news today-''  (<font color='red'><b>Hermione/HERMIONE</b></font>)</div>Lavender wailed loudly. <div class="bookquote">''- and she (<font color='blue'><b>Hermione</b></font>) can't have been
dreading it, because it's come as a real shock --''

 (<font color='red'><b>Ron</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Don't mind Hermione, Lavender,''  (<font color='red'><b>Ron</b></font>)</div>said Ron loudly, <div class="bookquote">``she (<font color='blue'><b>Hermione</b></font>) doesn't think
other people's pets matter very much.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Ron</b></font>)</div><p/>Professor McGonagall opened the classroom door at that moment, which was
perhaps lucky; Hermione and Ron were looking daggers at each other, and
when they got into class, they seated themselves on either side of Harry
and didn't talk to each other for the whole class.

<p/>Harry still hadn't decided what he (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) was going to say to Professor
McGonagall when the bell rang at the end of the lesson, but it was she (<font color='blue'><b>Hermione</b></font>)
who brought up the subject of Hogsmeade first.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``One moment, please !''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Hermione</b></font>) called as the class made to leave. <div class="bookquote">``As you're
all in my House, you should hand Hogsmeade permission forms to me before
Halloween. No form, no visiting the village, so don't forget!''

 (<font color='red'><b>Neville/Neville Longbottom/Longbottom</b></font>)</div><p/>Neville put up his (<font color='blue'><b>Neville</b></font>) hand.

<p/>``Please, Professor, I -- I think I've lost

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Your grandmother sent yours to me directly, Longbottom,''  (<font color='red'><b>Professor</b></font>)</div>said Professor
McGonagall. <div class="bookquote">``She (<font color='blue'><b>grandmother</b></font>) seemed to think it was safer. Well, that's all, you may
leave.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Ask her (<font color='blue'><b>grandmother</b></font>) now,''  (<font color='red'><b>Ron</b></font>)</div>Ron hissed at Harry.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Oh. but --''  (<font color='red'><b>Hermione/HERMIONE</b></font>)</div>Hermione began.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Go for it, Harry,''  (<font color='red'><b>Ron</b></font>)</div>said Ron stubbornly.

<p/>Harry waited for the rest of the class to disappear, then headed
nervously for Professor McGonagall's desk.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Yes, Potter?''  (<font color='red'><b>Harry/Potter/Harry Potter</b></font>)</div>Harry took a deep breath.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Professor, my aunt and uncle -- er -- forgot to sign my form,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) said.

<p/>Professor McGonagall looked over her (<font color='blue'><b>Hermione</b></font>) square spectacles at him (<font color='blue'><b>Professor</b></font>) but didn't
say anything.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``So -- er d'you think it would be all right mean, will It be okay if I
-- if I go to Hogsmeade?''

 (<font color='red'><b>Professor</b></font>)</div><p/>Professor McGonagall looked down and began shuffling papers on her (<font color='blue'><b>Hermione</b></font>) desk.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``I'm afraid not, Potter,''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Hermione</b></font>) said. <div class="bookquote">``You heard what I said. No form, no
visiting the village. That's the rule.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``But -- Professor, my aunt and uncle -- you know, they're Muggles, they
don't really understand about -- about Hogwarts forms and stuff,''  (<font color='red'><b>Harry/Potter/Harry Potter</b></font>)</div>Harry
said, while Ron egged him (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) on with vigorous nods. <div class="bookquote">``If you said I could go
--''

 (<font color='red'><b>Professor</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``But I don't say so,''  (<font color='red'><b>Professor</b></font>)</div>said Professor McGonagall, standing up and piling
her (<font color='blue'><b>Hermione</b></font>) papers neatly into a drawer. <div class="bookquote">``The form clearly states that the
parent or guardian must give permission.''  (<font color='red'><b>She</b></font>)</div>She (<font color='blue'><b>Hermione</b></font>) turned to look at him (<font color='blue'><b>Professor</b></font>),
with an odd expression on her (<font color='blue'><b>Hermione</b></font>) face. Was it pity? <div class="bookquote">``I'm sorry, Potter, but
that's my final word. You had better hurry, or you'll be late for your
next lesson.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/>There was nothing to be done. Ron called Professor McGonagall a lot of
names that greatly annoyed Hermione; Hermione assumed an
<div class="bookquote">``all-for-the-best''  (<font color='red'><b>Hermione/HERMIONE</b></font>)</div>expression that made Ron even angrier, and Harry had
to endure everyone in the class talking loudly and happily about what
they were going to do first, once they got into Hogsmeade.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``There's always the feast,''  (<font color='red'><b>Ron</b></font>)</div>said Ron, in an effort to cheer Harry UP.
<div class="bookquote">``You know, the Halloween feast, in the evening.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Yeah,''  (<font color='red'><b>Harry/Potter/Harry Potter</b></font>)</div>said Harry gloomily, <div class="bookquote">``great.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Harry/Potter/Harry Potter</b></font>)</div><p/>The Halloween feast was always good, but it would taste a lot better if
he (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) was coming to it after a day in Hogsmeade with everyone else. Nothing
anyone said made him (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) feel any better about being left behind. Dean
Thomas, who was good with a quill, had offered to forge Uncle Vernon's
signature on the form, but as Harry had already told Professor
McGonagall he (<font color='blue'><b>Professor</b></font>) hadn't had it signed, that was no good. Ron halfheartedly
suggested the Invisibility Cloak, but Hermione stamped on that one,
reminding Ron what Dumbledore had told them about the dementors being
able to see through them. Percy had what were possibly the least helpful
words of comfort.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``They make a fuss about Hogsmeade, but I assure you, Harry, it's not all
it's cracked up to be,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Percy</b></font>) said seriously. <div class="bookquote">``All right, the sweetshop's
rather good, and Zonko's Joke Shop's frankly dangerous, and yes, the
Shrieking Shack's always worth a visit, but really, Harry, apart from
that, you're not missing anything.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Harry/Potter/Harry Potter</b></font>)</div><p/>On Halloween morning, Harry awoke with the rest and went down to
breakfast, feeling thoroughly depressed, though doing his (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) best to act
normally.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``We'll bring you. lots of sweets back from Honeydukes,''  (<font color='red'><b>Hermione/HERMIONE</b></font>)</div>said Hermione,
looking desperately sorry for him (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>).

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Yeah, loads,''  (<font color='red'><b>Ron</b></font>)</div>said Ron. He (<font color='blue'><b>Ron</b></font>) and Hermione had finally forgotten their
squabble about Crookshanks in the face of Harry's difficulties.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Don't worry about me,''  (<font color='red'><b>Harry/Potter/Harry Potter</b></font>)</div>said Harry, in what he (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) hoped was at, offhand
voice, <div class="bookquote">``I'll see you at the feast. Have a good time.''

 (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div><p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) accompanied them to the entrance hall, where Filch, the caretaker,
was standing inside the front doors, checking off names against a long
list, peering suspiciously into every face, and making sure that no one
was sneaking out who shouldn't be going.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Staying here, Potter?''  (<font color='red'><b>Malfoy/Draco Malfoy/Draco</b></font>)</div>shouted Malfoy, who was standing in line with
Crabbe and Goyle. <div class="bookquote">``Scared of passing the dementors?''

 (<font color='red'><b>Harry/Potter/Harry Potter</b></font>)</div><p/>Harry ignored him (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) and made his (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) solitary way up the marble staircase,
through the deserted corridors, and back to Gryffindor Tower.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Password?''  (<font color='red'><b>Fat</b></font>)</div>said the Fat Lady, jerking out of a doze.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Fortuna Major,''  (<font color='red'><b>Harry/Potter/Harry Potter</b></font>)</div>said Harry listlessly.

<p/>The portrait swung open and he (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) climbed through the hole into the common
room. It was full of chattering first and second years, and a few older
students, who had obviously visited Hogsmeade so often the novelty had
worn off

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Harry! Harry! Hi, Harry!''

 (<font color='red'><b>Hogsmeade</b></font>)</div><p/>It was Colin Creevey, a second year who was deeply in awe of Harry and
never missed an opportunity to speak to him (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>).

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Aren't you going to Hogsmeade, Harry? Why not? Hey''  (<font color='red'><b>Colin</b></font>)</div>-- Colin looked
eagerly around at his (<font color='blue'><b>Colin</b></font>) friends -- <div class="bookquote">``you can come and sit with us, if you
like, Harry!''

 (<font color='red'><b>friends</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Er -- no, thanks, Colin,''  (<font color='red'><b>Harry/Potter/Harry Potter</b></font>)</div>said Harry, who wasn't in the mood to have a
lot of people staring avidly at the scar on his (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) forehead. <div class="bookquote">``I -- I've got
to go to the library, got to get some work done.''

 (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div><p/>After that, he (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) had no choice but to turn right around and head back out
of the portrait hole again.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``What was the point waking me up?''  (<font color='red'><b>Fat</b></font>)</div>the Fat Lady called grumpily after
him (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) as he (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) walked away.

<p/>Harry wandered dispiritedly toward the library, but halfway there he (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>)
changed his (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) mind; he (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) didn't feel like working. He (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) turned around and came
face-to-face with Filch, who had obviously just seen off the last of the
Hogsmeade visitors.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``What are you doing?''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>Filch snarled suspiciously.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Nothing,''  (<font color='red'><b>Harry/Potter/Harry Potter</b></font>)</div>said Harry truthfully.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Nothing!''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>spat Filch, his (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) jowls quivering unpleasantly. <div class="bookquote">``A likely
story! Sneaking around on your own -- why aren't you in Hogsmeade buying
Stink Pellets and Belch Powder and Whizzing Worms like the rest of your
nasty little friends?''

 (<font color='red'><b>Harry/Potter/Harry Potter</b></font>)</div><p/>Harry shrugged.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Well, get back to your common room where you belong!''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>snapped Filch,
and he (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) stood glaring until Harry had passed out of sight.

<p/>But Harry didn't go back to the common room; he (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) climbed a staircase,
thinking vaguely of visiting the Owlery to see Hedwig, and was walking
along another corridor when a voice from inside one of the rooms said,
<div class="bookquote">``Harry?''

 (<font color='red'><b>Hedwig</b></font>)</div><p/>Harry doubled back to see who had spoken and met Professor Lupin,
looking around his (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) office door.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``What are you doing?''  (<font color='red'><b>Lupin/R. J. Lupin</b></font>)</div>said Lupin, though in a very different voice from
Filch. <div class="bookquote">``Where are Ron and Hermione?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Hogsmeade,''  (<font color='red'><b>Harry/Potter/Harry Potter</b></font>)</div>said Harry, in a would-be casual voice.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Ah,''  (<font color='red'><b>Lupin/R. J. Lupin</b></font>)</div>said Lupin. He (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) considered Harry for a moment. <div class="bookquote">``Why don't you come
in? I've just taken delivery of a grindylow for our next lesson.''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``A
what?''  (<font color='red'><b>Harry/Potter/Harry Potter</b></font>)</div>said Harry. I

<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) followed Lupin into his (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) office. In the corner stood a very large tank
of water. A sickly green creature with sharp little horns had its face
pressed against the glass, pulling faces and flexing its long, spindly
fingers.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Water demon,''  (<font color='red'><b>Lupin/R. J. Lupin</b></font>)</div>said Lupin, surveying the grindylow thoughtfully. <div class="bookquote">``We
shouldn't have much difficulty with him (<font color='blue'><b>demon</b></font>), not after the kappas. The trick
is to break his (<font color='blue'><b>demon</b></font>) grip. You notice the abnormally long fingers? Strong,
but very brittle.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/>The grindylow bared its green teeth and then buried itself in a tangle
of weeds in a corner.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Cup of tea?''  (<font color='red'><b>Lupin/R. J. Lupin</b></font>)</div>Lupin said, looking around for his (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) kettle. <div class="bookquote">``I was just
thinking of making one.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``All right,''  (<font color='red'><b>Harry/Potter/Harry Potter</b></font>)</div>said Harry awkwardly.

<p/>Lupin tapped the kettle with his (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) wand and a blast of steam issued
suddenly from the spout.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Sit down,''  (<font color='red'><b>Lupin/R. J. Lupin</b></font>)</div>said Lupin, taking the lid off a dusty tin. <div class="bookquote">``I've only got
teabags, I'm afraid -- but I daresay you've had enough of tea leaves?''

 (<font color='red'><b>Harry/Potter/Harry Potter</b></font>)</div><p/>Harry looked at him (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>). Lupin's eyes were twinkling.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``How did you know about that?''  (<font color='red'><b>Harry/Potter/Harry Potter</b></font>)</div>Harry asked.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Professor McGonagall told me,''  (<font color='red'><b>Lupin/R. J. Lupin</b></font>)</div>said Lupin, passing Harry a chipped mug
of tea. <div class="bookquote">``You're not worried, are you?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``No,''  (<font color='red'><b>Harry/Potter/Harry Potter</b></font>)</div>said Harry.

<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) thought for a moment of telling Lupin about the dog he (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>)'d seen in
Magnolia Crescent but decided not to. He (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) didn't want Lupin to think he (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>)
was a coward, especially since Lupin alreadv seemed to think he (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) couldn't
cope with a boggart.

<p/>Something of Harry's thoughts seemed to have shown on his (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) face, because
Lupin said, <div class="bookquote">``Anything worrying you, Harry?''

 (<font color='red'><b>Lupin/R. J. Lupin</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``No,''  (<font color='red'><b>Harry/Potter/Harry Potter</b></font>)</div>Harry lied. He (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) drank a bit of tea and watched the grindylow
brandishing a fist at him (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>). <div class="bookquote">``Yes,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) said suddenly, putting his (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) tea down
on Lupin's desk. <div class="bookquote">``You know that day we fought the boggart?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Yes,''  (<font color='red'><b>Lupin/R. J. Lupin</b></font>)</div>said Lupin slowly.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Why didn't you let me fight it?''  (<font color='red'><b>Harry/Potter/Harry Potter</b></font>)</div>said Harry abruptly.

<p/>Lupin raised his (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) eyebrows.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``I would have thought that was obvious, Harry,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) said, sounding
surprised.

<p/>Harry, who had expected Lupin to deny that he (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>)'d done any such thing, was
taken aback.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Why?''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) said again.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Well,''  (<font color='red'><b>Lupin/R. J. Lupin</b></font>)</div>said Lupin, frowning slightly, <div class="bookquote">``I assumed that if the boggart
faced you, it would assume the shape of Lord Voldemort.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Lupin/R. J. Lupin</b></font>)</div><p/>Harry stared. Not only was this the last answer he (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>)'d expected, but Lupin
had said Voldemort's name. The only person Harry had ever heard say the
name aloud -LRB-apart from himself-RRB- was Professor Dumbledore.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Clearly, I was wrong,''  (<font color='red'><b>Lupin/R. J. Lupin</b></font>)</div>said Lupin, still frowning at Harry. <div class="bookquote">``But I
didn't think it a good idea for Lord Voldemort to materialize in the
staffroom. I imagined that people would panic.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I didn't think of Voldemort,''  (<font color='red'><b>Harry/Potter/Harry Potter</b></font>)</div>said Harry honestly. <div class="bookquote">``I -- I remembered
those dementors.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I see,''  (<font color='red'><b>Lupin</b></font>)</div>said Lupin thoughtfully. <div class="bookquote">``Well, well... I'm impressed.''  (<font color='red'><b>Harry/Potter/Harry Potter</b></font>)</div>fie
smiled slightly at the look of surprise on Harry's face. <div class="bookquote">``That suggests
that what you fear most of all is -- fear. Very wise, Harry.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Harry/Potter/Harry Potter</b></font>)</div><p/>Harry didn't know what to say to that, so he (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) drank some mot,, tea.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``So you've been thinking that I didn't believe you capable of fighting
the boggart?''  (<font color='red'><b>Lupin/R. J. Lupin</b></font>)</div>said Lupin shrewdly.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Well... yeah,''  (<font color='red'><b>Harry/Potter/Harry Potter</b></font>)</div>said Harry. He (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) was suddenly feeling a lot happier.
<div class="bookquote">``Professor Lupin, you know the dementors --''

 (<font color='red'><b>He</b></font>)</div><p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) was interrupted by a knock on the door.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Come in,''  (<font color='red'><b>Lupin</b></font>)</div>called Lupin.

<p/>The door opened, and in came Snape. He (<font color='blue'><b>Snape</b></font>) was carrying a goblet, which was
smoking faintly, and stopped at the sight of Harry, his (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) black eyes
narrowing.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Ah, Severus,''  (<font color='red'><b>Lupin/R. J. Lupin</b></font>)</div>said Lupin, smiling. <div class="bookquote">``Thanks very much. Could you leave
it here on the desk for me?''

 (<font color='red'><b>Snape/Severus/Severus Snape</b></font>)</div><p/>Snape set down the smoking goblet, his (<font color='blue'><b>Snape</b></font>) eyes wandering between Harry and
Lupin.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``I was just showing Harry my grindylow,''  (<font color='red'><b>Lupin/R. J. Lupin</b></font>)</div>said Lupin pleasantly, pointing
at the tank.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Fascinating,''  (<font color='red'><b>Snape/Severus/Severus Snape</b></font>)</div>said Snape, without looking at it. <div class="bookquote">``You should drink that
directly, Lupin.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Yes, Yes, I will,''  (<font color='red'><b>Lupin/R. J. Lupin</b></font>)</div>said Lupin.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``I made an entire cauldronful,''  (<font color='red'><b>Snape/Severus/Severus Snape</b></font>)</div>Snape continued. ``If you need more.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``I should probably take some again tomorrow. Thanks very much, Severus.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Not at all,''  (<font color='red'><b>Snape/Severus/Severus Snape</b></font>)</div>said Snape, but there was a look in his (<font color='blue'><b>Snape</b></font>) eye Harry didn't
like. He (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) backed out of the room, unsmiling and watchful.

<p/>Harry looked curiously at the goblet. Lupin smiled.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Professor Snape has very kindly concocted a potion for me,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) said. <div class="bookquote">``I
have never been much of a potion-brewer and this one is particularly
complex.''  (<font color='red'><b>He</b></font>)</div>He (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) picked up the goblet and sniffed it. <div class="bookquote">``Pity sugar makes it
useless,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) added, taking a sip and shuddering.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Why --?''  (<font color='red'><b>Harry/Potter/Harry Potter</b></font>)</div>Harry began. Lupin looked at him (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) and answered the unfinished
question.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``I've been feeling a bit off-color,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) said. <div class="bookquote">``This potion is the only
thing that helps. I am very lucky to be working alongside Professor
Snape; there aren't many wizards who are up to making it.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Professor</b></font>)</div><p/>Professor Lupin took another sip and Harry had a crazy urge to knock the
goblet out of his (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) hands.

<p/>``Professor Snape's very interested in the Dark Arts, he (<font color='blue'><b>Snape</b></font>) blurted out.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Really?''  (<font color='red'><b>Lupin/R. J. Lupin</b></font>)</div>said Lupin, looking only mildly interested as he (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) took another
gulp of potion.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Some people reckon --''  (<font color='red'><b>Harry/Potter/Harry Potter</b></font>)</div>Harry hesitated, then plunged recklessly on,
<div class="bookquote">``some people reckon he (<font color='blue'><b>Snape</b></font>)'d do anything to get the Defense Against the Dark
Arts job.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Harry/Potter/Harry Potter</b></font>)</div><p/>Lupin drained the goblet and pulled a face.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Disgusting,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) said. <div class="bookquote">``Well, Harry, I'd better get back to work. see
you at the feast later.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Right,''  (<font color='red'><b>Harry/Potter/Harry Potter</b></font>)</div>said Harry, putting down his (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) empty teacup.

<p/>The empty goblet was still smoking.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``There you go,''  (<font color='red'><b>Ron</b></font>)</div>said Ron. <div class="bookquote">``We got as much as we could carry.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Harry/Potter/Harry Potter</b></font>)</div><p/>A shower of brilliantly colored sweets fell into Harry's lap. It was
dusk, and Ron and Hermione had just turned up in the common room,
pink-faced from the cold wind and looking as though they'd had the time
of their lives.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Thanks,''  (<font color='red'><b>Harry/Potter/Harry Potter</b></font>)</div>said Harry, picking up a packet of tiny black Pepper Imps.
<div class="bookquote">``What's Hogsmeade like? Where did you go?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/>By the sound of it -- everywhere. Dervish and Banges, the wizarding
equipment shop, Zonko's Joke Shop, into the Three Broomsticks for
foaming mugs of hot butterbeer, and many places besides.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``The post office, Harry! About two hundred owls, all sitting on shelves,
all color-coded depending on how fast you want your letter to get
there!''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Honeydukes has got a new kind of fudge; they were giving out free
samples, there's a bit, look --''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``We think we saw an ogre, honestly, they get all sorts at the Three
Broomsticks --''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Wish we could have brought you some butterbeer, really warms you up --''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``What did you do?''  (<font color='red'><b>Hermione/HERMIONE</b></font>)</div>said Hermione, looking anxious. <div class="bookquote">``Did you get any work
done?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``No,''  (<font color='red'><b>Harry/Potter/Harry Potter</b></font>)</div>said Harry. <div class="bookquote">``Lupin made me a cup of tea in his (<font color='blue'><b>ogre</b></font>) office. And then
Snape came in...''

 (<font color='red'><b>He</b></font>)</div><p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) told them all about the goblet. Ron's mouth fell open.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Lupin drank it?''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) gasped. <div class="bookquote">``Is he (<font color='blue'><b>Snape</b></font>) mad?''

 (<font color='red'><b>Hermione/HERMIONE</b></font>)</div><p/>Hermione checked her (<font color='blue'><b>Hermione</b></font>) watch.

<p/>``We'd better go down, you know, the feast'll be starting in fiveminutes
They hurried through the portrait hole and into the crowd, still
discussing Snape.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``But if he (<font color='blue'><b>Snape</b></font>) -- you know''  (<font color='red'><b>Hermione/HERMIONE</b></font>)</div>-- Hermione dropped her (<font color='blue'><b>Hermione</b></font>) voice, glancing
nervously around -- <div class="bookquote">``if he (<font color='blue'><b>Snape</b></font>) was trying to to poison Lupin -- he (<font color='blue'><b>Snape</b></font>) wouldn't
have done it in front of Harry.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Hermione/HERMIONE</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Yeah, maybe,''  (<font color='red'><b>Harry/Potter/Harry Potter</b></font>)</div>said Harry as they reached the entrance hall and crossed
into the Great Hall. It had been decorated with hundreds and hundreds of
candle-filled pumpkins, a cloud of fluttering live bats, and many
flaming orange streamers, which were swimming lazily across the stormy
ceiling like brilliant watersnakes.

<p/>The food was delicious; even Hermione and Ron, who were full to bursting
with Honeydukes sweets, managed second helpings of everything. Harry
kept glancing at the staff table. Professor Lupin

<p/>looked cheerful and as well as he (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) ever did; he (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) was talking animatedly to
tiny little Professor Flitwick, the Charms teacher. Harry moved his (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) eyes
along the table, to the place where Snape sat. Was he (<font color='blue'><b>Snape</b></font>) imagining it, or
were Snape's eyes flickering toward Lupin more often than was natural?

<p/>The feast finished with an entertainment provided by the Hogwarts
ghosts. They popped out of the walls and tables to do a bit of formation
gliding; Nearly Headless Nick, the Gryffindor ghost, had a great success
with a reenactment of his (<font color='blue'><b>Nick</b></font>) own botched beheading.

<p/>It had been such a pleasant evening that Harry's good mood couldn't even
be spoiled by Malfoy, who shouted through the crowd as they all left the
hall, <div class="bookquote">``The dementors send their love, Potter!''

 (<font color='red'><b>Malfoy/Draco Malfoy/Draco</b></font>)</div><p/>Harry, Ron, and Hermione followed the rest of the Gryffindors along the
usual path to Gryffindor Tower, but when they reached the corridor that
ended with the portrait of the Fat Lady, they found it jammed with
students.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Why isn't anyone going in?''  (<font color='red'><b>Ron</b></font>)</div>said Ron curiously.

<p/>Harry peered over the heads in front of him (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>). The portrait seemed to be
closed.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Let me through, please,''  (<font color='red'><b>Percy/Weasley/Percy Weasley</b></font>)</div>came Percy's voice, and he (<font color='blue'><b>Percy</b></font>) came bustling
importantly through the crowd. <div class="bookquote">``What's the holdup here? You can't all
have forgotten the password -- excuse me, I'm Head Boy --''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/>And then a silence fell over the crowd, from the front first, so that a
chill seemed to spread down the corridor. They heard Percy say, in a
suddenly sharp voice, <div class="bookquote">``Somebody get Professor Dumbledore. Quick.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Percy/Weasley/Percy Weasley</b></font>)</div><p/>People's heads turned; those at the back were standing on tiptoe.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``What's going on?''  (<font color='red'><b>Ginny</b></font>)</div>said Ginny, who had just arrived.

<p/>A moment later, Professor Dumbledore was there, sweeping toward the
portrait; the Gryffindors squeezed together to let him (<font color='blue'><b>Dumbledore</b></font>) through, and
Harry, Ron, and Hermione moved closer to see what the trouble was.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Oh, my --''  (<font color='red'><b>Hermione/HERMIONE</b></font>)</div>Hermione grabbed Harry's arm.

<p/>The Fat Lady had vanished from her (<font color='blue'><b>Lady</b></font>) portrait, which had been slashed so
viciously that strips of canvas littered the floor; great chunks of it
had been torn away completely.

<p/>Dumbledore took one quick look at the ruined painting and turned, his (<font color='blue'><b>Dumbledore</b></font>)
eyes somber, to see Professors McGonagall, Lupin, and Snape hurrying
toward him (<font color='blue'><b>Snape</b></font>).

<p/><div class="bookquote">``We need to find her (<font color='blue'><b>anyone</b></font>),''  (<font color='red'><b>Dumbledore/Albus Dumbledore</b></font>)</div>said Dumbledore. <div class="bookquote">``Professor McGonagall, please go
to Mr. Filch at once and tell him (<font color='blue'><b>Filch</b></font>) to search every painting in the castle
for the Fat Lady.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``You'll be lucky!''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>said a cackling voice.

<p/>It was Peeves the Poltergeist, bobbing over the crowd and looking
delighted, as he (<font color='blue'><b>Dumbledore</b></font>) always did, at the sight of wreckage or worry.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``What do you mean, Peeves?''  (<font color='red'><b>Dumbledore/Albus Dumbledore</b></font>)</div>said Dumbledore calmly, and Peeves's grin
faded a little. He (<font color='blue'><b>Dumbledore</b></font>) didn't dare taunt Dumbledore. Instead he (<font color='blue'><b>Dumbledore</b></font>) adopted an
oily voice that was no better than his (<font color='blue'><b>Dumbledore</b></font>) cackle. <div class="bookquote">``Ashamed, Your Headship,
sit. Doesn't want to be seen. She (<font color='blue'><b>Lady</b></font>)'s a horrible mess. Saw her (<font color='blue'><b>Lady</b></font>) running
through the landscape up on the fourth floor, sir, dodging between the
trees. Crying something dreadful,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Dumbledore</b></font>) said happily. <div class="bookquote">``Poor thing,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Dumbledore</b></font>)
added unconvincingly.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Did she (<font color='blue'><b>Lady</b></font>) say who did it?''  (<font color='red'><b>Dumbledore/Albus Dumbledore</b></font>)</div>said Dumbledore quietly.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Oh yes, Professorhead,''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>said Peeves, with the air of one cradling a
large bombshell in his (<font color='blue'><b>Dumbledore</b></font>) arms. <div class="bookquote">``He (<font color='blue'><b>Filch</b></font>) got very angry when she (<font color='blue'><b>Lady</b></font>) wouldn't let
him (<font color='blue'><b>Filch</b></font>) in, you see.''  (<font color='red'><b>Dumbledore/Albus Dumbledore</b></font>)</div>Peeves flipped over and grinned at Dumbledore from
between his (<font color='blue'><b>Dumbledore</b></font>) own legs. <div class="bookquote">``Nasty temper he (<font color='blue'><b>Filch</b></font>)'s got, that Sirius Black.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Professor</b></font>)</div><p/>CHAPTER NINE

<p/>GRIM DEFEAT

<p/>Professor Dumbledore sent all the Gryffindors back to the Great Hall,
where they were joined ten minutes later by the students from
Hufflepuff, Ravenclaw, and Slytherin, who all looked extremely confused.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``The teachers and I need to conduct a thorough search of the castle,''
 (<font color='red'><b>Professor</b></font>)</div>Professor Dumbledore told them as Professors McGonagall and Flitwick
closed all doors into the hall. <div class="bookquote">``I'm afraid that, for your own safety,
you will have to spend the night here. I want the prefects to stand
guard over the entrances to the hall and I am leaving the Head Boy and
Girl in charge. Any disturbance should be reported to me immediately,''
 (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Dumbledore</b></font>) added to Percy, who was looking immensely proud and important. <div class="bookquote">``Send
word with one of the ghosts.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Professor</b></font>)</div><p/>Professor Dumbledore paused, about to leave the hall, and said, <div class="bookquote">``Oh,
yes, you'll be needing...''

 (<font color='red'><b>Dumbledore/Albus Dumbledore</b></font>)</div><p/>One casual wave of his (<font color='blue'><b>Dumbledore</b></font>) wand and the long tables flew to the edges of the
hall and stood themselves against the walls; another wave, and the floor
was covered with hundreds of squashy purple sleeping bags.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Sleep well,''  (<font color='red'><b>Professor</b></font>)</div>said Professor Dumbledore, closing the door behind him (<font color='blue'><b>Dumbledore</b></font>).

<p/>The hall immediately began to buzz excitedly; the Gryffindors were
telling the rest of the school what had just happened.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Everyone into their sleeping bags!''  (<font color='red'><b>Percy/Weasley/Percy Weasley</b></font>)</div>shouted Percy. <div class="bookquote">``Come on, now, no
more talking! Lights out in ten minutes!''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``C'mon,''  (<font color='red'><b>Ron</b></font>)</div>Ron said to Harry and Hermione; they seized three sleeping bags
and dragged them into a corner.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Do you think Black's still in the castle?''  (<font color='red'><b>Hermione/HERMIONE</b></font>)</div>Hermione whispered
anxiously.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Dumbledore obviously thinks he (<font color='blue'><b>Dumbledore</b></font>) might be,''  (<font color='red'><b>Ron</b></font>)</div>said Ron.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``It's very lucky he (<font color='blue'><b>Dumbledore</b></font>) picked tonight, you know,''  (<font color='red'><b>Hermione/HERMIONE</b></font>)</div>said Hermione as they
climbed fully dressed into their sleeping bags and propped themselves on
their elbows to talk. <div class="bookquote">``The one night we weren't in the tower...''

 (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div><p/>I reckon he (<font color='blue'><b>Ron</b></font>)'s lost track of time, being on the run,'' said Ron. <div class="bookquote">``Didn't
realize it was Halloween. Otherwise he (<font color='blue'><b>Dumbledore</b></font>)'d have come bursting in here.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Hermione/HERMIONE</b></font>)</div><p/>Hermione shuddered.

<p/>All around them, people were asking one another the same question: <div class="bookquote">``How
did he (<font color='blue'><b>Dumbledore</b></font>) get in?''

 (<font color='red'><b>people</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Maybe he (<font color='blue'><b>Dumbledore</b></font>) knows how to Apparate,''  (<font color='red'><b>a Ravenclaw</b></font>)</div>said a Ravenclaw a few feet away,
<div class="bookquote">``Just appear out of thin air, you know.''

 (<font color='red'><b>a Ravenclaw</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Disguised himself, probably,''  (<font color='red'><b>Hufflepuff</b></font>)</div>said a Hufflepuff fifth year. <div class="bookquote">``He (<font color='blue'><b>Dumbledore</b></font>)
could've flown in,''  (<font color='red'><b>Dean Thomas/Dean</b></font>)</div>suggested Dean Thomas.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Honestly, am I the only person who's ever bothered to read Hogwarts, A
History?''  (<font color='red'><b>Hermione/HERMIONE</b></font>)</div>said Hermione crossly to Harry and Ron.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Probably,''  (<font color='red'><b>Ron</b></font>)</div>said Ron. <div class="bookquote">``Why?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/>``Because the castle's protected by more than walls, You know,,, said
Hermione. <div class="bookquote">``There are all sorts of enchantments on it, to stop people
entering by stealth. You can't just Apparate in here. And I'd like to
see the disguise that could fool those dementors. They're guarding every
single entrance to the grounds. They'd have seen him (<font color='blue'><b>Hogwarts</b></font>) fly in too. And
Fitch knows all the secret passages, they'll have them covered...''

 (<font color='red'><b>Percy/Weasley/Percy Weasley</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``The lights are going out now!''  (<font color='red'><b>Percy/Weasley/Percy Weasley</b></font>)</div>Percy shouted. <div class="bookquote">``I want everyone in their
sleeping bags and no more talking!''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/>The candles all went out at once. The only light now came from the
silvery ghosts, who were drifting about talking seriously to the
prefects, and the enchanted ceiling, which, like the sky outside, was
scattered with stars. What with that, and the whispering that still
filled the hall, Harry felt as though he (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) were sleeping outdoors in a
light wind.

<p/>Once every hour, a teacher would reappear in the hall to check that
everything was quiet. Around three in the morning, when many students
had finally fallen asleep, Professor Dumbledore came in. Harry watched
him (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) looking around for Percy, who had been prowling between the sleeping
bags, telling people off for talking. Percy was only a short way away
from Harry, Ron, and Hermlone, who quickly pretended to be asleep as
Dumbledore's footsteps drew nearer.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Any sign of him (<font color='blue'><b>Hogwarts</b></font>), Professor?''  (<font color='red'><b>Percy/Weasley/Percy Weasley</b></font>)</div>asked Percy in a whisper.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``No. All well here?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Everything under control, sir.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Good. There's no point moving them all now. I've found a temporary
guardian for the Gryffindor portrait hole. You'll be able to move them
back in tomorrow.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``And the Fat Lady, sir?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Hiding in a map of Argyllshire on the second floor. Apparently she (<font color='blue'><b>Lady</b></font>)
refused to let Black in without the password, so he (<font color='blue'><b>Black</b></font>) attacked. She (<font color='blue'><b>Lady</b></font>)'s
still very distressed, but once she (<font color='blue'><b>Lady</b></font>)'s calmed down, I'll have Mr. Filch
restore her (<font color='blue'><b>Lady</b></font>).''

 (<font color='red'><b>Harry/Potter/Harry Potter</b></font>)</div><p/>Harry heard the door of the hall creak open again, and more footsteps.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Headmaster?''  (<font color='red'><b>Snape/Severus/Severus Snape</b></font>)</div>It was Snape. Harry kept quite still, listening hard. <div class="bookquote">``The
whole of the third floor has been searched. He (<font color='blue'><b>Headmaster</b></font>)'s not there. And Filch
has done the dungeons; nothing there either.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``What about the Astronomy tower? Professor Trelawney's room? The
Owlery?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``All searched.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Very well, Severus. I didn't really expect Black to linger.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Have you any theory as to how he (<font color='blue'><b>Severus</b></font>) got in, Professor?''  (<font color='red'><b>Snape/Severus/Severus Snape</b></font>)</div>asked Snape.

<p/>Harry raised his (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) head very slightly off his (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) arms to free his (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) other ear,

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Many, Severus, each of them as unlikely as the next.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Harry/Potter/Harry Potter</b></font>)</div><p/>Harry opened his (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) eyes a fraction and squinted up to where they stood;
Dumbledore's back was to him (<font color='blue'><b>Dumbledore</b></font>), but he (<font color='blue'><b>Dumbledore</b></font>) could see Percy's face, rapt with
attention, and Snape's profile, which looked angry.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``You remember the conversation we had, Headmaster, just before -- ah --
the start of term?''  (<font color='red'><b>Snape/Severus/Severus Snape</b></font>)</div>said Snape, who was barely opening his (<font color='blue'><b>Snape</b></font>) lips, as
though trying to block Percy out of the conversation.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``I do, Severus,''  (<font color='red'><b>Dumbledore/Albus Dumbledore</b></font>)</div>said Dumbledore, and there was something like warning
in his (<font color='blue'><b>Dumbledore</b></font>) voice.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``It seems -- almost impossible -- that Black could have entered the
school without inside help. I did express my concerns whet, you
appointed --''

 (<font color='red'><b>Dumbledore/Albus Dumbledore</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I do not believe a single person inside this castle would have helped
Black enter it,''  (<font color='red'><b>Dumbledore/Albus Dumbledore</b></font>)</div>said Dumbledore, and his (<font color='blue'><b>Dumbledore</b></font>) tone made it so clear that the
subject was closed that Snape didn't reply. <div class="bookquote">``I must go down to the
dementors,''  (<font color='red'><b>Dumbledore/Albus Dumbledore</b></font>)</div>said Dumbledore. I said I would inform them when our search
was complete.''

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Didn't they want to help, sit?''  (<font color='red'><b>Percy/Weasley/Percy Weasley</b></font>)</div>said Percy.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Oh yes,''  (<font color='red'><b>Dumbledore/Albus Dumbledore</b></font>)</div>said Dumbledore coldly. <div class="bookquote">``But I'm afraid no dementor will cross
the threshold of this castle while I am headmaster.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Percy/Weasley/Percy Weasley</b></font>)</div><p/>Percy looked slightly abashed. Dumbledore left the hall, walking quickly
and quietly. Snape stood for a moment, watching the headmaster with an
expression of deep resentment on his (<font color='blue'><b>Snape</b></font>) face; then he (<font color='blue'><b>Snape</b></font>) too left.

<p/>Harry glanced sideways at Ron and Hermione. Both of them had their eyes
open too, reflecting the starry ceiling.

<p/><div class="bookquote">''\What was all that about?''  (<font color='red'><b>Ron</b></font>)</div>Ron mouthed.

<p/>The school talked of nothing but Sirius Black for the next few days. The
theories about how he (<font color='blue'><b>Black</b></font>) had entered the castle became wilder and wilder;
Hannah Abbott, from Hufflepuff, spent much of their next Herbology class
telling anyone who'd listen that Black could turn into a flowering
shrub.

<p/>The Fat Lady's ripped canvas had been taken off the wall and

<p/>Replaced with the portrait of Sir Cadogan and his (<font color='blue'><b>Black</b></font>) fat gray pony. Nobody
was very happy about this. Sir Cadogan spent half his (<font color='blue'><b>Black</b></font>) time challenging
people to duels, and the rest thinking up ridiculously complicated
passwords, which he (<font color='blue'><b>Black</b></font>) changed at least twice a day.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``He (<font color='blue'><b>headmaster</b></font>)'s a complete lunatic,''  (<font color='red'><b>Seamus Finnigan/Seamus</b></font>)</div>said Seamus Finnigan angrily to Percy. <div class="bookquote">``Can't
we get anyone else?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``None of the other pictures wanted the job,''  (<font color='red'><b>Percy/Weasley/Percy Weasley</b></font>)</div>said Percy. <div class="bookquote">``Frightened of
what happened to the Fat Lady. Sir Cadogan was the only one brave enough
to volunteer.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Cadogan</b></font>)</div><p/>Sir Cadogan, however, was the least of Harry's worries. He (<font color='blue'><b>Percy</b></font>) was now being
closely watched. Teachers found excuses to walk along corridors with
him (<font color='blue'><b>Percy</b></font>), and Percy Weasley -LRB-acting, Harry suspected, on his (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) mother's orders-RRB-
was tailing him (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) everywhere like an extremely pompous guard dog. To cap
it all, Professor McGonagall summoned Harry into her (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) office, with such a
somber expression on her (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) face Harry thought someone must have died.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``There's no point hiding it from you any longer, Potter,''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) said in a
very serious voice. <div class="bookquote">``I know this will come as a shock to you, but Sirius
Black --''

 (<font color='red'><b>Harry/Potter/Harry Potter</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I know he (<font color='blue'><b>Black</b></font>)'s after me,''  (<font color='red'><b>Harry/Potter/Harry Potter</b></font>)</div>said Harry wearily. <div class="bookquote">``I heard Ron's dad telling
his (<font color='blue'><b>Ron</b></font>) mum. Mr. Weasley works for the Ministry of Magic.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Professor</b></font>)</div><p/>Professor McGonagall seemed very taken aback. She (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) stared at Harry for a
moment or two, then said, <div class="bookquote">``I see! Well, in that case, Potter, you'll
understand why I don't think it's a good idea for you to be practicing
Quidditch in the evenings. Out on the field with only Your team members,
it's very exposed, Potter --''

 (<font color='red'><b>Harry</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``We've got our first match on Saturday!''  (<font color='red'><b>Harry/Potter/Harry Potter</b></font>)</div>said Harry, outraged. <div class="bookquote">``I've got
to train, Professor!''

 (<font color='red'><b>Professor</b></font>)</div><p/>Professor McGonagall considered him (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) intently. Harry knew she (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) was deeply
interested in the Gryffindor team's prospects; it had been she (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>), after
all, who'd suggested him (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) as Seeker in the first Place. He (<font color='blue'><b>Seeker</b></font>) waited,
holding his (<font color='blue'><b>Seeker</b></font>) breath.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Hmm...''  (<font color='red'><b>Professor</b></font>)</div>Professor McGonagall stood up and stared out of the window at
the Quidditch field, just visible through the rain. <div class="bookquote">``Well... goodness
knows, I'd like to see us win the Cup at last... but all the same,
Potter... I'd be happier if a teacher were present. I'll ask Madam Hooch
to oversee your training sessions.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/>The weather worsened steadily as the first Quidditch match drew nearer.
Undaunted, the Gryffindor team was training harder than ever under the
eye of Madam Hooch. Then, at their final training session before
Saturday's match, Oliver Wood gave his (<font color='blue'><b>Wood</b></font>) team some unwelcome news.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``We're not playing Slytherin!''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Wood</b></font>) told them, looking very angry.
<div class="bookquote">``Flint's just been to see me. We're playing Hufflepuff instead.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Why?''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>chorused the rest of the team.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Flint's excuse is that their Seeker's arm's still injured,''  (<font color='red'><b>Wood/Oliver/Oliver Wood</b></font>)</div>said Wood,
grinding his (<font color='blue'><b>Wood</b></font>) teeth furiously. <div class="bookquote">``But it's obvious why they're doing it.
Don't want to play in this weather. Think it'll damage their
chances...''

 (<font color='red'><b>Wood/Oliver/Oliver Wood</b></font>)</div><p/>There had been strong winds and heavy rain all day, and as Wood spoke,
they heard a distant rumble of thunder.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``There's nothing wrong with Malfoy's arm!''  (<font color='red'><b>Harry/Potter/Harry Potter</b></font>)</div>said Harry furiously. <div class="bookquote">``He (<font color='blue'><b>Malfoy</b></font>)'s
faking it!''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I know that, but we can't prove it,''  (<font color='red'><b>Wood/Oliver/Oliver Wood</b></font>)</div>said Wood bitterly, <div class="bookquote">``And we've
been practicing all those moves assuming we're playing Slytherin, and
instead it's Hufflepuff, and their style's quite different. They've got
a new Captain and Seeker, Cedric Diggory --''

 (<font color='red'><b>Wood/Oliver/Oliver Wood</b></font>)</div><p/>Angelina, Alicia, and Katie suddenly giggled.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``What?''  (<font color='red'><b>Wood/Oliver/Oliver Wood</b></font>)</div>said Wood, frowning at this lighthearted behavior.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``He (<font color='blue'><b>Captain</b></font>)'s that tall, good-looking one, isn't he (<font color='blue'><b>Captain</b></font>)?''  (<font color='red'><b>Angelina</b></font>)</div>said Angelina.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Strong and silent,''  (<font color='red'><b>Katie/Katie Bell/Bell</b></font>)</div>said Katie, and they started to giggle again.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``He (<font color='blue'><b>Captain</b></font>)'s only silent because he (<font color='blue'><b>Captain</b></font>)'s too thick to string two words together,''
 (<font color='red'><b>Fred/Fred Weasley</b></font>)</div>said Fred impatiently. <div class="bookquote">``I don't know why you're worried, Oliver,
Hufflepuff is a pushover. Last time we played them, Harry caught the
Snitch in about five minutes, remember?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``We were playing in completely different conditions!''  (<font color='red'><b>Wood/Oliver/Oliver Wood</b></font>)</div>Wood shouted, his (<font color='blue'><b>Wood</b></font>)
eyes bulging slightly. <div class="bookquote">``Diggory's put a very strong side together! He (<font color='blue'><b>Diggory</b></font>)'s
an excellent Seeker! I was afraid you'd take it like this! We mustn't
relax! We must keep our focus! Slytherin is trying to wrong-foot us! We
must win!''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Oliver, calm down!''  (<font color='red'><b>Fred/Fred Weasley</b></font>)</div>said Fred, looking slightly alarmed. <div class="bookquote">``We're taking
Hufflepuff very seriously. Seriously.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/>The day before the match, the winds reached howling point and the rain
fell harder than ever. It was so dark inside the corridors and
classrooms that extra torches and lanterns were lit. The Slytherin team
was looking very smug indeed, and none more so than Malfoy.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Ah, if only my arm was feeling a bit better!''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Malfoy</b></font>) sighed as the gale
outside pounded the windows.

<p/>Harry had no room in his (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) head to worry about anything except the match
tomorrow. Oliver Wood kept hurrying up to him (<font color='blue'><b>Wood</b></font>) between classes and giving
him (<font color='blue'><b>Wood</b></font>) tips. The third time this happened, Wood talked for so long that
Harry suddenly realized he (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) was ten minutes late for Defense Against the
Dark Arts, and set off at a run with Wood shouting after him (<font color='blue'><b>Wood</b></font>), <div class="bookquote">``Diggory's
got a very fast swerve, Harry, so you might want to try looping him (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) --''

 (<font color='red'><b>him</b></font>)</div><p/>Harry skidded to a halt outside the Defense Against the Dark Arts
classroom, pulled the door open, and dashed inside.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Sorry I'm late, Professor Lupin. I --''

 (<font color='red'><b>Professor</b></font>)</div><p/>But it wasn't Professor Lupin who looked up at him (<font color='blue'><b>Professor</b></font>) from the teacher's
desk; it was Snape.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``This lesson began ten minutes ago, Potter, so I think we'll make it ten
points from Gryffindor. Sit down.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Harry/Potter/Harry Potter</b></font>)</div><p/>But Harry didn't move.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Where's Professor Lupin?''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) said.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``He (<font color='blue'><b>Professor</b></font>) says he (<font color='blue'><b>Professor</b></font>) is feeling too ill to teach today,''  (<font color='red'><b>Snape/Severus/Severus Snape</b></font>)</div>said Snape with a
twisted smile. <div class="bookquote">``I believe I told you to sit down?''

 (<font color='red'><b>Harry/Potter/Harry Potter</b></font>)</div><p/>But Harry stayed where he (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) was.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``What's wrong with him (<font color='blue'><b>Professor</b></font>)?''

 (<font color='red'><b>Snape/Severus/Severus Snape</b></font>)</div><p/>Snape's black eyes glittered.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Nothing life-threatening,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) said, looking as though he (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) wished it
were. <div class="bookquote">``Five more points from Gryffindor, and if I have to ask you to sit
down again, it will be fifty.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Harry/Potter/Harry Potter</b></font>)</div><p/>Harry walked slowly to his (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) seat and sat down. Snape looked around at the
class.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``As I was saying before Potter interrupted, Professor Lupin has not left
any record of the topics you have covered so far --''

 (<font color='red'><b>Hermione/HERMIONE</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Please, sir, we've done boggarts, Red Caps, kappas, and grindylows,''
 (<font color='red'><b>Hermione/HERMIONE</b></font>)</div>said Hermione quickly, <div class="bookquote">``and we're just about to start --''

 (<font color='red'><b>Hermione/HERMIONE</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Be quiet,''  (<font color='red'><b>Hermione/HERMIONE</b></font>)</div>said Snape coldly. <div class="bookquote">``I did not ask for information. I was
merely commenting on Professor Lupin's lack of organization.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``He (<font color='blue'><b>Professor</b></font>)'s the best Defense Against the Dark Arts teacher we've ever had,''
 (<font color='red'><b>Dean Thomas/Dean</b></font>)</div>said Dean Thomas boldly, and there was a murmur of agreement from the
rest of the class. Snape looked more menacing than ever.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``You are easily satisfied. Lupin is hardly overtaxing you -- I ,Would
expect first years to be able to deal with Red Caps and grindylows.
Today we shall discuss --''

 (<font color='red'><b>Harry/Potter/Harry Potter</b></font>)</div><p/>Harry watched him (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) flick through the textbook, to the very back chapter,
which he (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) must know they hadn't covered.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Werewolves,''  (<font color='red'><b>Snape/Severus/Severus Snape</b></font>)</div>said Snape.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``But, sir,''  (<font color='red'><b>Hermione/HERMIONE</b></font>)</div>said Hermione, seemingly unable to restrain herself, <div class="bookquote">``we're
not supposed to do werewolves yet, we're due to start hinkypunks --''

 (<font color='red'><b>Hermione/HERMIONE</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Miss Granger,''  (<font color='red'><b>Hermione/HERMIONE</b></font>)</div>said Snape in a voice of deadly calm, <div class="bookquote">``I was under the
impression that I am teaching this lesson, not you. And I am telling you
all to turn to page 394.''  (<font color='red'><b>Snape/Severus/Severus Snape</b></font>)</div>He (<font color='blue'><b>Snape</b></font>) glanced around again. <div class="bookquote">``All of you! Now!''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/>With many bitter sidelong looks and some sullen muttering, the class
opened their books.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Which of you can tell me how we distinguish between the werewolf and
the true wolf?''  (<font color='red'><b>Snape/Severus/Severus Snape</b></font>)</div>said Snape.

<p/>Everyone sat in motionless silence; everyone except Hermione, whose
hand, as it so often did, had shot straight into the air.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Anyone?''  (<font color='red'><b>Snape/Severus/Severus Snape</b></font>)</div>Snape said, ignoring Hermione. His (<font color='blue'><b>Snape</b></font>) twisted smile was back.
<div class="bookquote">``Are you telling me that Professor Lupin hasn't even taught you the
basic distinction between --''

 (<font color='red'><b>Parvati/Parvati Patil</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``We told you,''  (<font color='red'><b>Parvati/Parvati Patil</b></font>)</div>said Parvati suddenly, <div class="bookquote">``we haven't got as far as
werewolves yet, we're still on --''

 (<font color='red'><b>Parvati/Parvati Patil</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Silence!''  (<font color='red'><b>Parvati/Parvati Patil</b></font>)</div>snarled Snape. <div class="bookquote">``Well, well, well, I never thought I'd meet a
third-year class who wouldn't even recognize a werewolf when they saw
one. I shall make a point of informing Professor Dumbledore how very
behind you all are...''

 (<font color='red'><b>Hermione/HERMIONE</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Please, sir,''  (<font color='red'><b>Hermione/HERMIONE</b></font>)</div>said Hermione, whose hand was still in the air, <div class="bookquote">``the
werewolf differs from the true wolf in several small ways. The snout of
the werewolf --''

 (<font color='red'><b>Hermione/HERMIONE</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``That is the second time you have spoken out of turn, Miss Granger,''
 (<font color='red'><b>Snape/Severus/Severus Snape</b></font>)</div>said Snape coolly. <div class="bookquote">``Five more points from Gryffindor for being an
insufferable know-it-all.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Hermione/HERMIONE</b></font>)</div><p/>Hermione went very red, put down her (<font color='blue'><b>Hermione</b></font>) hand, and stared at the floor with
her (<font color='blue'><b>Hermione</b></font>) eyes full of tears. It was a mark of how much the class loathed
Snape that they were all glaring at him (<font color='blue'><b>Snape</b></font>), because every one of them had
called Hermione a know-it-all at least once, and Ron, who told Hermione
she (<font color='blue'><b>Hermione</b></font>) was a know-it-all at least twice a week, said loudly, <div class="bookquote">``You asked us
a question and she (<font color='blue'><b>Granger</b></font>) knows the answer! Why ask if you don't want to be
told?''

 (<font color='red'><b>Ron a know-it-all</b></font>)</div><p/>The class knew instantly he (<font color='blue'><b>Ron</b></font>)'d gone too far. Snape advanced on Ron
slowly, and the room held its breath.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Detention, Weasley,''  (<font color='red'><b>Snape/Severus/Severus Snape</b></font>)</div>Snape said silkily, his (<font color='blue'><b>Snape</b></font>) face very close to Ron's.
<div class="bookquote">``And if I ever hear you criticize the way I teach a class again, you
will be very sorry indeed.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/>No one made a sound throughout the rest of the lesson. They sat and made
notes on werewolves from the textbook, while Snape prowled up and down
the rows of desks, examining the work they had been doing with Professor
Lupin.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Very poorly explained... That is incorrect, the kappa is more commonly
found in Mongolia... Professor Lupin gave this eight out of ten? I
wouldn't have given it three...''

 (<font color='red'><b>Snape/Severus/Severus Snape</b></font>)</div><p/>When the bell rang at last, Snape held them back.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``You will each write an essay, to be handed in to me, on the ways you
recognize and kill werewolves. I want two rolls of parchment or, the
subject, and I want them by Monday morning. It is time somebody took
this class in hand. Weasley, stay behind, we need to arrange your
detention.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Harry/Potter/Harry Potter</b></font>)</div><p/>Harry and Hermione left the room with the rest of the class, who waited
until they were well out of earshot, then burst into a furious tirade
about Snape.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Snape's never been like this with any of our other Defense Against the
Dark Arts teachers, even if he (<font color='blue'><b>Snape</b></font>) did want the job,''  (<font color='red'><b>Harry/Potter/Harry Potter</b></font>)</div>Harry said to
Hermione. <div class="bookquote">``Why's he (<font color='blue'><b>Snape</b></font>) got it in for Lupin? D'you think this is all because
of the boggart?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I don't know,''  (<font color='red'><b>Hermione/HERMIONE</b></font>)</div>said Hermione pensively. <div class="bookquote">``But I really hope Professor
Lupin gets better soon...''

 (<font color='red'><b>Ron</b></font>)</div><p/>Ron caught up with them five minutes later, in a towering rage.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``D'you know what that --''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>-LRB-he (<font color='blue'><b>Ron</b></font>) called Snape something that made Hermione
say <div class="bookquote">``Ron!'' (<font color='red'><b>Hermione/HERMIONE</b></font>)</div>-RRB- <div class="bookquote">''-- is making me do? I've got to scrub out the bedpans in
the hospital wing. Without magic!''  (<font color='red'><b>Hermione/HERMIONE</b></font>)</div>He (<font color='blue'><b>Snape</b></font>) was breathing deeply, his (<font color='blue'><b>Snape</b></font>) fists
clenched. <div class="bookquote">``Why couldn't Black have hidden in Snape's office, eh? He (<font color='blue'><b>Snape</b></font>)
could have finished him (<font color='blue'><b>Snape</b></font>) off for us!''

 (<font color='red'><b>Harry/Potter/Harry Potter</b></font>)</div><p/>Harry woke extremely early the next morning; so early that it was till
dark. For a moment he (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) thought the roaring of the wind had woken him (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>).
Then he (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) felt a cold breeze on the back of his (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) neck and sat bolt upright
-- Peeves the Poltergeist had been floating next to him (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>), blowing hard in
his (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) ear.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``What did you do that for?''  (<font color='red'><b>Harry/Potter/Harry Potter</b></font>)</div>said Harry furiously. Peeves puffed out his (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>)
cheeks, blew hard, and zoomed backward out of the room, cackling.

<p/>Harry fumbled for his (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) alarm clock and looked at it. It was half past
four. Cursing Peeves, he (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) rolled over and tried to get back to sleep, but
it was very difficult, now that he (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) was awake, to ignore the sounds of
the thunder rumbling overhead, the pounding of the wind against the
castle walls, and the distant creaking of the trees in the Forbidden
Forest. In a few hours he (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) would be out on the Quidditch field, battling
through that gale. Finally, he (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) gave up any thought of more sleep, got
up, dressed, picked up his (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) Nimbus Two Thousand, and walked quietly out
of the dormitory.

<p/>As Harry opened the door, something brushed against his (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) leg. He (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) bent
down just in time to grab Crookshanks by the end of his (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) bushy tail and
drag him (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) outside.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``You know, I reckon Ron was right about you,''  (<font color='red'><b>Harry/Potter/Harry Potter</b></font>)</div>Harry told Crookshanks
suspiciously. <div class="bookquote">``There are plenty of mice around this place -- go and
chase them. Go on,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) added, nudging Crookshanks down the spiral
staircase with his (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) foot. <div class="bookquote">``Leave Scabbers alone.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/>The noise of the storm was even louder in the common roorn. Harry knew
better than to think the match would be canceled; Quidditch matches
weren't called off for trifles like thunderstorms. Nevertheless, he (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) was
starting to feel very apprehensive. Wood had pointed out Cedric Diggory
to him (<font color='blue'><b>Wood</b></font>) in the corridor; Diggory was a fifth year and a lot bigger than
Harry. Seekers were usually light

<p/>and speedy, but Diggory's weight would be an advantage in this weather
because he (<font color='blue'><b>Diggory</b></font>) was less likely to be blown off course.

<p/>Harry whiled away the hours until dawn in front of the fire, getting up
every now and then to stop Crookshanks from sneaking up

<p/>the boys, staircase again. At long last Harry thought it must be time
for breakfast, so he (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) headed through the portrait hole alone.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Stand and fight, you mangy cur!''  (<font color='red'><b>Cadogan</b></font>)</div>yelled Sir Cadogan.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Oh, shut up,''  (<font color='red'><b>Harry/Potter/Harry Potter</b></font>)</div>Harry yawned.

<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) revived a bit over a large bowl of porridge, and by the time he (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>)'d
started on toast, the rest of the team had turned up.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``It's going to be a tough one,''  (<font color='red'><b>Wood/Oliver/Oliver Wood</b></font>)</div>said Wood, who wasn't eating anything.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Stop worrying, Oliver,''  (<font color='red'><b>Alicia/Alicia Spinner</b></font>)</div>said Alicia soothingly, <div class="bookquote">``we don't mind a bit of
rain.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Alicia/Alicia Spinner</b></font>)</div><p/>But it was considerably more than a bit of rain. Such was the popularity
of Quidditch that the whole school turned out to watch the match as
usual, but they ran down the lawns toward the Quidditch field, heads
bowed against the ferocious wind, umbrellas being whipped out of their
hands as they went. just before he (<font color='blue'><b>Wood</b></font>) entered the locker room, Harry saw
Malfoy, Crabbe, and Goyle, laughing and pointing at him (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) from under an
enormous umbrella on their way to the stadium.

<p/>The team changed into their scarlet robes and waited for Wood's usual
pre-match pep talk, but it didn't come. He (<font color='blue'><b>Wood</b></font>) tried to speak several times,
made an odd gulping noise, then shook his (<font color='blue'><b>Wood</b></font>) head hopelessly and beckoned
them to follow him (<font color='blue'><b>Wood</b></font>).

<p/>The wind was so strong that they staggered sideways as they walked out
onto the field. If the crowd was cheering, they couldn't hear it over
the fresh rolls of thunder. Rain was splattering over Harry's glasses.
How on earth was he (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) going to see the Snitch in this?

<p/>The Hufflepuffs were approaching from the opposite side of the field,
wearing canary-yellow robes. The Captains walked up to eacb other and
shook hands; Diggory smiled at Wood but Wood no, looked as though he (<font color='blue'><b>Wood</b></font>) had
lockjaw and merely nodded. Harry saw Madam Hooch's mouth form the words,
``Mount Your brooms.,, He (<font color='blue'><b>Oliver</b></font>) pulled his (<font color='blue'><b>Oliver</b></font>) right foot out of the mud with a
squelch and swung it over his (<font color='blue'><b>Oliver</b></font>) Nimbus Two Thousand. Madam Hooch put her (<font color='blue'><b>Hooch</b></font>)
whistle to her (<font color='blue'><b>Hooch</b></font>) lips and gave it a blast that sounded shrill and distant
they were off

<p/>Harry rose fast, but his (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) Nimbus was swerving slightly with the wind. He (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>)
held it as steady as he (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) could and turned, squinting into the rain.

<p/>Within five minutes Harry was soaked to his (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) skin and frozen, hardly able
to see his (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) teammates, let alone the tiny Snitch. He (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) flew backward and
forward across the field past blurred red and yellow shapes, with no
idea of what was happening in the rest of the game. He (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) couldn't hear the
commentary over the wind. The crowd was hidden beneath a sea of cloaks
and battered umbrellas. Twice Harry came very close to being unseated by
a Bludger; his (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) vision was so clouded by the rain on his (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) glasses he (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>)
hadn't seen them coming.

<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) lost track of time. It was getting harder and harder to hold his (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>)
broom straight. The sky was getting darker, as though night had decided
to come early. Twice Harry nearly hit another player, without knowing
whether it was a teammate or opponent; everyone was now so wet, and the
rain so thick, he (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) could hardly tell them apart...

<p/>With the first flash of lightning came the sound of Madam Hooch's
whistle; Harry could just see the outline of Wood through the thick
rain, gesturing him (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) to the ground. The whole team splashed down into the
mud.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``I called for time-out!''  (<font color='red'><b>Wood/Oliver/Oliver Wood</b></font>)</div>Wood roared at his (<font color='blue'><b>Wood</b></font>) team. <div class="bookquote">``Come on, under here
--''

 (<font color='red'><b>Harry/Potter/Harry Potter</b></font>)</div><p/>They huddled at the edge of the field under a large umbrella; Harry took
off his (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) glasses and wiped them hurriedly on his (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) robes.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``What's the score?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``We're fifty points up,''  (<font color='red'><b>Wood/Oliver/Oliver Wood</b></font>)</div>said Wood, <div class="bookquote">``but unless we get the Snitch soon,
we'll be playing into the night.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Wood/Oliver/Oliver Wood</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I've got no chance with these on,''  (<font color='red'><b>Harry/Potter/Harry Potter</b></font>)</div>Harry said exasperatedly, waving his (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>)
glasses.

<p/>At that very moment, Hermione appeared at his (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) shoulder; she (<font color='blue'><b>Hermione</b></font>) was holding
her (<font color='blue'><b>Hermione</b></font>) cloak over her (<font color='blue'><b>Hermione</b></font>) head and was, inexplicably, beaming.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``I've had an idea, Harry! Give me your glasses, quick!''

 (<font color='red'><b>He</b></font>)</div><p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) handed them to her (<font color='blue'><b>Hermione</b></font>), and as the team watched in amazement, Hermione
tapped them with her (<font color='blue'><b>Hermione</b></font>) wand and said, <div class="bookquote">``Impervius!''

 (<font color='red'><b>Hermione/HERMIONE</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``There!''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Hermione</b></font>) said, handing them back to Harry. <div class="bookquote">``They'll repel water!''

 (<font color='red'><b>Wood</b></font>)</div><p/>Wood looked as though he (<font color='blue'><b>Wood</b></font>) could have kissed her (<font color='blue'><b>Hermione</b></font>).

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Brilliant!''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Wood</b></font>) called hoarsely after her (<font color='blue'><b>Hermione</b></font>) as she (<font color='blue'><b>Hermione</b></font>) disappeared into the
crowd. <div class="bookquote">``Okay, team, let's go for it!''

 (<font color='red'><b>Hermione/HERMIONE</b></font>)</div><p/>Hermione's spell had done the trick. Harry was still numb with cold,
still wetter than he (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>)'d ever been in his (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) life, but he (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) could see. Full of
fresh determination, he (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) urged his (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) broom through the turbulent air,
staring in every direction for the Snitch, avoiding a Bludger, ducking
beneath Diggory, who was streaking in the opposite direction...

<p/>There was another clap of thunder, followed immediately by forked
lightning. This was getting more and more dangerous. Harry needed to get
the Snitch quickly -

<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) turned, intending to head back toward the middle of the field, but at
that moment, another flash of lightning illuminated the stands, and
Harry saw something that distracted him (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) completely , the silhouette of
an enormous shaggy black dog, clearly imprinted against the sky,
motionless in the topmost, empty row of seats.

<p/>Harry's numb hands slipped on the broom handle and his (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) Nimbus dropped a
few feet. Shaking his (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) sodden bangs out of his (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) eyes, he (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) squinted back
into the stands. The dog had vanished.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Harry!''  (<font color='red'><b>Wood/Oliver/Oliver Wood</b></font>)</div>came Wood's anguished yell from the Gryffindor goal posts.
<div class="bookquote">``Harry, behind you!''

 (<font color='red'><b>Harry</b></font>)</div><p/>Harry looked wildly around. Cedric Diggory was pelting up the field, and
a tiny speck of gold was shimmering in the rain-filled air between them
-

<p/>With a jolt of panic, Harry threw himself flat to the broornhandle and
zoomed toward the Snitch.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Come on!''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) growled at his (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) Nimbus as the rain whipped his (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) face.
`Taster!''

<p/>But something odd was happening. An eerie silence was falling across the
stadium. The wind, though as strong as ever, was forgetting to roar. It
was as though someone had turned off the sound, as though Harry had gone
suddenly deaf -- what was going on?

<p/>And then a horribly familiar wave of cold swept over him (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>), inside him (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>),
just as he (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) became aware of something moving on the field below...

<p/>Before he (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>)'d had time to think, Harry had taken his (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) eyes off the Snitch
and looked down.

<p/>At least a hundred dementors, their hidden faces pointing up at him (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>),
were standing beneath him (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>). It was as though freezing water were rising
in his (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) chest, cutting at his (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) insides. And then he (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) heard it again...
Someone was screaming, screaming inside his (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) head... a woman...

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Not Harry, not Harry, please not Harry!''

 (<font color='red'><b>a woman Harry Harry</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Stand aside, you silly girl... stand aside, now...''

 (<font color='red'><b>Harry/Potter/Harry Potter</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Not Harry, please no, take me, kill me instead --''

 (<font color='red'><b>Harry/Potter/Harry Potter</b></font>)</div><p/>Numbing, swirling white mist was filling Harry's brain... What was he (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>)
doing? Why was he (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) flying? He (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) needed to help her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>)... She (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) was going to
die... She (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) was going to be murdered...

<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) was falling, falling through the icy mist.

<p/>``Not Harry! Please... have mercy... have mercy...

<p/>A shrill voice was laughing, the woman was screaming, and Harry knew no
more.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Lucky the ground was so soft.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I thought he (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) was dead for sure.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``But he (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) didn't even break his (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) glasses.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Harry/Potter/Harry Potter</b></font>)</div><p/>Harry could hear the voices whispering, but they made no sense
whatsoever. He (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) didn't have a clue where he (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) was, or how he (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>)'d got there,
or what he (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>)'d been doing before he (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) got there. All he (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) knew was that every
inch of him (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) was aching as though it had been beaten.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``That was the scariest thing I've ever seen in my life.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Harry/Potter/Harry Potter</b></font>)</div><p/>Scariest... the scariest thing... hooded black figures... cold ...
screaming...

<p/>Harry's eyes snapped open. He (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) was lying in the hospital wing. The
Gryffindor Quidditch team, spattered with mud from head to foot, was
gathered around his (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) bed. Ron and Hermione were also there, looking as
though they'd just climbed out of a swimming pool.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Harry!''  (<font color='red'><b>Fred/Fred Weasley</b></font>)</div>said Fred, who looked extremely white underneath, the mud.
<div class="bookquote">``How're you feeling?''

 (<font color='red'><b>Harry/Potter/Harry Potter</b></font>)</div><p/>It was as though Harry's memory was on fast forward. The lightning --
the Grim -- the Snitch -- and the dementors...

<p/><div class="bookquote">``What happened?''  (<font color='red'><b>the Grim Snitch</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) said, sitting up so suddenly they all gasped.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``You fell off,''  (<font color='red'><b>Fred/Fred Weasley</b></font>)</div>said Fred. <div class="bookquote">``Must've been -- what -- fifty feet?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``We thought you'd died,''  (<font color='red'><b>Alicia/Alicia Spinner</b></font>)</div>said Alicia, who was shaking.

<p/>Hermione made a small, squeaky noise. Her (<font color='blue'><b>Hermione</b></font>) eyes were extremely bloodshot.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``But the match,''  (<font color='red'><b>Harry/Potter/Harry Potter</b></font>)</div>said Harry. <div class="bookquote">``What happened? Are we doing a replay?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/>No one said anything. The horrible truth sank into Harry like a stone.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``We didn't -- lose?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Diggory got the Snitch,''  (<font color='red'><b>George/George Weasley/Weasley</b></font>)</div>said George. <div class="bookquote">``Just after you fell. He (<font color='blue'><b>Diggory</b></font>) didn't
realize what had happened. When he (<font color='blue'><b>Diggory</b></font>) looked back and saw you on the
ground, he (<font color='blue'><b>Diggory</b></font>) tried to call it off. Wanted a rematch. But they won fair and
square... even Wood admits it.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Where is Wood?''  (<font color='red'><b>Harry/Potter/Harry Potter</b></font>)</div>said Harry, suddenly realizing he (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) wasn't there.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Still in the showers,''  (<font color='red'><b>Fred/Fred Weasley</b></font>)</div>said Fred. <div class="bookquote">``We think he (<font color='blue'><b>Wood</b></font>)'s trying to drown
himself.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Harry/Potter/Harry Potter</b></font>)</div><p/>Harry put his (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) face to his (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) knees, his (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) hands gripping his (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) hair. Fred
grabbed his (<font color='blue'><b>Fred</b></font>) shoulder and shook it roughly.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``C'mon, Harry, you've never missed the Snitch before.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``There had to be one time you didn't get it,''  (<font color='red'><b>George/George Weasley/Weasley</b></font>)</div>said George.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``It's not over yet,''  (<font color='red'><b>Fred/Fred Weasley</b></font>)</div>said Fred. <div class="bookquote">``We lost by a hundred points''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Right? So if Hufflepuff loses to Ravenclaw and we beat Ravenclaw and
Slytherin --.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Hufflepuff'll have to lose by at least two hundred points,''  (<font color='red'><b>George/George Weasley/Weasley</b></font>)</div>said
George.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``But if they beat Ravenclaw...''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``No Way, Ravenclaw is too good. But if Slytherin loses against
Hufflepuff...''

 (<font color='red'><b>Harry/Potter/Harry Potter</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``It all depends on the points -- a margin of a hundred either way.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Harry/Potter/Harry Potter</b></font>)</div><p/>Harry lay there, not saying a word. They had lost... for the first time
ever, he (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) had lost a Quidditch match.

<p/>After ten minutes or so, Madam Pomfrey came over to tell the team to
leave him (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) in peace.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``We'll come and see you later,''  (<font color='red'><b>Fred/Fred Weasley</b></font>)</div>Fred told him (<font color='blue'><b>Fred</b></font>). <div class="bookquote">``Don't beat yourself up,
Harry, you're still the best Seeker we've ever had.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/>The team trooped out, trailing mud behind them. Madam Pomfrey shut the
door behind them, looking disapproving. Ron and Hermione moved nearer to
Harry's bed.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Dumbledore was really angry,''  (<font color='red'><b>Hermione/HERMIONE</b></font>)</div>Hermione said in a quaking voice. <div class="bookquote">``I've
never seen him (<font color='blue'><b>Dumbledore</b></font>) like that before. He (<font color='blue'><b>Dumbledore</b></font>) ran onto the field as You fell,
waved his (<font color='blue'><b>Dumbledore</b></font>) wand, and you sort of slowed down before you hit the ground.
Then he (<font color='blue'><b>Dumbledore</b></font>) whirled his (<font color='blue'><b>Dumbledore</b></font>) wand at the dementors. Shot silver stuff at them.
They left the stadium right away... He (<font color='blue'><b>Dumbledore</b></font>) was furious they'd come onto the
grounds. We heard him (<font color='blue'><b>Dumbledore</b></font>) --''

 (<font color='red'><b>Ron</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Then he (<font color='blue'><b>Dumbledore</b></font>) magicked you onto a stretcher,''  (<font color='red'><b>Ron</b></font>)</div>said Ron. <div class="bookquote">``And walked up to
school with you floating on it. Everyone thought you were --''

 (<font color='red'><b>Harry/Potter/Harry Potter</b></font>)</div><p/>His (<font color='blue'><b>Ron</b></font>) voice faded, but Harry hardly noticed. He (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) was thinking about what
the dementors had done to him (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>)... about the screaming voice. He (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) looked up
and saw Ron and Hermione lookin, at him (<font color='blue'><b>Ron</b></font>) so anxiously that he (<font color='blue'><b>Ron</b></font>) quickly
cast around for something matter-of-fact to say.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Did someone get my Nimbus?''

 (<font color='red'><b>Ron</b></font>)</div><p/>Ron and Hermione looked quickly at each other.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Er --''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``What?''  (<font color='red'><b>Harry/Potter/Harry Potter</b></font>)</div>said Harry, looking from one to the other.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Well... when you fell off, it got blown away,''  (<font color='red'><b>Hermione/HERMIONE</b></font>)</div>said Hermione
hesitantly.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``And?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``And it hit -- it hit -- oh, Harry -- it hit the Whomping Willow.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Harry/Potter/Harry Potter</b></font>)</div><p/>Harry's insides lurched. The Whomping Willow was a very violent tree
that stood alone in the middle of the grounds.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``And?''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) said, dreading the answer.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Well, you know the Whomping Willow,''  (<font color='red'><b>Ron</b></font>)</div>said Ron. <div class="bookquote">``It -- it doesn't like
being hit.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/>``Professor Flitwick brought it back just before you came around, said
Hermione in a very small voice.

<p/>Slowly, she (<font color='blue'><b>Hermione</b></font>) reached down for a bag at her (<font color='blue'><b>Hermione</b></font>) feet, turned it upside down,
and tipped a dozen bits of splintered wood and twig onto the bed, the
only remains of Harry's faithful, finally beaten broomstick.

<p/>CHAPTER TEN

<p/>THE MARAUDER``S MAP

<p/>Madam Pomfrey insisted on keeping Harry in the hospital wing for the
rest of the weekend. He (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) didn't argue or complain, but he (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) wouldn't let
her (<font color='blue'><b>Hermione</b></font>) throw away the shattered remnants of his (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) Nimbus Two Thousand. He (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>)
knew he (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) was being stupid, knew that the Nimbus was beyond repair, but
Harry couldn't help it; he (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) felt as though he (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>)'d lost one of his (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) best
friends.

<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) had a stream of visitors, all intent on cheering him (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) up. Hagrid sent
him (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) a bunch of earwiggy flowers that looked like yellow cabbages, and
Ginny Weasley, blushing furiously, turned up with a get-well card she (<font color='blue'><b>Ginny</b></font>)
had made herself, which sang shrilly unless Harry kept it shut under his (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>)
bowl of fruit. The Gryffindor team visited again on Sunday morning, this
time accompanied by Wood, who told Harry -LRB-in a hollow, dead sort of
voice-RRB- that he (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) didn't blame



<p/>him (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) in the slightest. Ron and Hermione left Harry's bedside only at
night- But nothing anyone said or did could make Harry feel any better,
because they knew only half of what was troubling him (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>).

<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) hadn't told anyone about the Grim, not even Ron -and Hermione,
because he (<font color='blue'><b>Ron</b></font>) knew Ron would panic and Hermione would scoff. The fact
remained, however, that it had now appeared twice, and both appearances
had been followed by near-fatal accidents; the first time, he (<font color='blue'><b>Ron</b></font>) had nearly
been run over by the Knight Bus; the second, fallen fifty feet from his (<font color='blue'><b>Knight</b></font>)
broomstick. Was the Grim going to haunt him (<font color='blue'><b>Grim</b></font>) until he (<font color='blue'><b>Grim</b></font>) actually died? Was
he (<font color='blue'><b>Grim</b></font>) going to spend the rest of his (<font color='blue'><b>Grim</b></font>) life looking over his (<font color='blue'><b>Grim</b></font>) shoulder for the
beast?

<p/>And then there were the dementors. Harry felt sick and humiliated every
time he (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) thought of them. Everyone said the dementors were horrible, but
no one else collapsed every time they went near one. No one else heard
echoes in their head of their dying parents.

<p/>Because Harry knew who that screaming voice belonged to now. He (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) had
heard her (<font color='blue'><b>Grim</b></font>) words, heard them over and over again during the night hours
in the hospital wing while he (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) lay awake, staring at the strips of
moonlight on the ceiling. When the dementors approached him (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>), he (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) heard
the last moments of his (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) mother's life, her (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) attempts to protect him (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>),
Harry, from Lord Voldemort, and Voldemort's laughter before he (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) murdered
her (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>)... Harry dozed fitfully, sinking into dreams full of clammy, rotted
hands and petrified pleading, jerking awake to dwell again on his (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>)
mother's voice.

<p/>It was a relief to return to the noise and bustle of the main school on
Monday, where he (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) was forced to think about other things, eve', if he (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) had
to endure Draco Malfoys taunting. Malfoy was almost beside himself with
glee at Gryffindor's defeat. He (<font color='blue'><b>Malfoy</b></font>) had finally taken off his (<font color='blue'><b>Malfoy</b></font>) bandages, and
celebrated having the full use of both arms again by doing spirited
imitations of Harry falling off his (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) broom. Malfoy spent much of their
next Potions class doing dementor imitations across the dungeon; Ron
finally cracked and flung a large, slippery crocodile heart at Malfoy,
which hit him (<font color='blue'><b>Malfoy</b></font>) in the face and caused Snape to take fifty points from
Gryffindor.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``If Snape's teaching Defense Against the Dark Arts again, I'm skiving
off,''  (<font color='red'><b>Ron</b></font>)</div>said Ron as they headed toward Lupin's classroom after lunch.
<div class="bookquote">``Check who's in there, Hermione.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Hermione/HERMIONE</b></font>)</div><p/>Hermione peered around the classroom door.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``It's okay!''

 (<font color='red'><b>Professor</b></font>)</div><p/>Professor Lupin was back at work. It certainly looked as though he (<font color='blue'><b>Professor</b></font>) had
been ill. His (<font color='blue'><b>Professor</b></font>) old robes were hanging more loosely on him (<font color='blue'><b>Professor</b></font>) and there were
dark shadows beneath his (<font color='blue'><b>Professor</b></font>) eyes; nevertheless, he (<font color='blue'><b>Professor</b></font>) smiled at the class as
they took their seats, and they burst at once into an explosion of
complaints about Snape's behavior while Lupin had been ill.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``It's not fair, he (<font color='blue'><b>Snape</b></font>) was only filling in, why should he (<font color='blue'><b>Snape</b></font>) give us homework?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``We don't know anything about werewolves two rolls of parchment!''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Did you tell Professor Snape we haven't covered them yet?''  (<font color='red'><b>Lupin/R. J. Lupin</b></font>)</div>Lupin asked,
frowning slightly.

<p/>The babble broke out again.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Yes, but he (<font color='blue'><b>Snape</b></font>) said we were really behind he (<font color='blue'><b>Snape</b></font>) wouldn't listen --''

 (<font color='red'><b>Professor</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">''-- two rolls of parchment!''

 (<font color='red'><b>Professor</b></font>)</div><p/>Professor Lupin smiled at the look of indignation on every face.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Don't worry. I'll speak to Professor Snape. You don't have to do the
essay.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Oh no,''  (<font color='red'><b>Hermione/HERMIONE</b></font>)</div>said Hermione, looking very disappointed. <div class="bookquote">``I've already
finished it!''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/>They had a very enjoyable lesson. Professor Lupin had brought along a
glass box containing a hinkypunk, a little one-legged creature who
looked as though he (<font color='blue'><b>Professor</b></font>) were made of wisps of smoke, rather frail and
harmless looking.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Lures travelers into bogs,''  (<font color='red'><b>Professor</b></font>)</div>said Professor Lupin as they took notes.
<div class="bookquote">``You notice the lantern dangling from his (<font color='blue'><b>Snape</b></font>) hand? Hops ahead -people
follow the light -- then --''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/>The hinkypunk made a horrible squelching noise against the glass.

<p/>When the bell rang, everyone gathered up their things and headed for the
door, Harry among them, but --

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Wait a moment, Harry,''  (<font color='red'><b>Harry/Potter/Harry Potter</b></font>)</div>Lupin called. <div class="bookquote">``I'd like a word.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Harry</b></font>)</div><p/>Harry doubled back and watched Professor Lupin covering the hinkypunk's
box with a cloth.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``I heard about the match,''  (<font color='red'><b>Lupin/R. J. Lupin</b></font>)</div>said Lupin, turning back to his (<font color='blue'><b>Professor</b></font>) desk and
starting to pile books into his (<font color='blue'><b>Professor</b></font>) briefcase, <div class="bookquote">``and I'm sorry about your
broomstick. Is there any chance of fixing it?''

 (<font color='red'><b>Lupin/R. J. Lupin</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``No,''  (<font color='red'><b>Harry/Potter/Harry Potter</b></font>)</div>said Harry. <div class="bookquote">``The tree smashed it to bits.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Lupin/R. J. Lupin</b></font>)</div><p/>Lupin sighed.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``They planted the Whomping Willow the same year that I arrived at
Hogwarts. People used to play a game, trying to get near enough to touch
the trunk. In the end, a boy called Davey Gudgeon nearly lost an eye,
and we were forbidden to go near it. No broomstick would have a chance.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Did you hear about the dementors too?''  (<font color='red'><b>Harry/Potter/Harry Potter</b></font>)</div>said Harry with difficulty.

<p/>Lupin looked at him (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) quickly.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Yes, I did. I don't think any of us have seen Professor Dumbledore that
angry. They have been growing restless for some time -- furious at his (<font color='blue'><b>Professor</b></font>)
refusal to let them inside the grounds... I suppose they were the
reason you fell?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Yes,''  (<font color='red'><b>Harry/Potter/Harry Potter</b></font>)</div>said Harry. He (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) hesitated, and then the question he (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) had to ask
burst from him (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) before he (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) could stop himself.<div class="bookquote">'' Why? Why do they affect me
like that? Am I just --?''

 (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``It has nothing to do with weakness,''  (<font color='red'><b>Professor</b></font>)</div>said Professor Lupin sharply, as
though he (<font color='blue'><b>Professor</b></font>) had read Harry's mind. <div class="bookquote">``The dementors affect you worse than
the others because there are horrors in your past that the others don't
have.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Lupin</b></font>)</div><p/>A ray of wintery sunlight fell across the classroom, illuminating
Lupin's gray hairs and the lines on his (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) young face.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Dementors are among the foulest creatures that walk this earth. They
infest the darkest, filthiest places, they glory in decay and despair,
they drain peace, hope, and happiness out of the air around them. Even
Muggles feel their presence, though they can't see them. Get too near a
dementor and every good feeling, every happy memory will be sucked out
of you. If it can, the dementor will feed on you long enough to reduce
you to something like itself... soul-less and evil. You'll be left with
nothing but the worst experiences of your life. And the worst that
happened to you, Harry, is enough to make anyone fall off their broom.
You have nothing to feel ashamed of.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``When they get near me --''  (<font color='red'><b>Harry/Potter/Harry Potter</b></font>)</div>Harry stared at Lupin's desk, his (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) throat
tight. <div class="bookquote">``I can hear Voldemort murdering my mum.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Lupin/R. J. Lupin</b></font>)</div><p/>Lupin made a sudden motion with his (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) arm as though to grip Harry's
shoulder, but thought better of it. There was a moment's Silence, then
--

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Why did they have to come to the match?''  (<font color='red'><b>Harry/Potter/Harry Potter</b></font>)</div>said Harry bitterly.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``They're getting hungry,''  (<font color='red'><b>Lupin/R. J. Lupin</b></font>)</div>said Lupin coolly, shutting his (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) briefcase with
a snap. <div class="bookquote">``Dumbledore won't let them into the school, so their supply of
human prey has dried up... I don't think they could resist the large
crowd around the Quidditch field. All that excitement ... emotions
running high... it was their idea of a feast.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Azkaban must be terrible,''  (<font color='red'><b>Harry/Potter/Harry Potter</b></font>)</div>Harry muttered. Lupin nodded grimly.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``The fortress is set on a tiny island, way out to sea, but they don't
need walls and water to keep the prisoners in, not when they're all
trapped inside their own heads, incapable of a single cheery thought.
Most of them go mad within weeks.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``But Sirius Black escaped from them,''  (<font color='red'><b>Harry/Potter/Harry Potter</b></font>)</div>Harry said slowly. <div class="bookquote">``He (<font color='blue'><b>Black</b></font>) got
away...''

 (<font color='red'><b>Lupin</b></font>)</div><p/>Lupin's briefcase slipped from the desk; he (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) had to stoop quickly to
catch it.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Yes,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) said, straightening up, <div class="bookquote">``Black must have found a way to fight
them. I wouldn't have believed it possible... Dementors are supposed to
drain a wizard of his (<font color='blue'><b>wizard</b></font>) powers if he (<font color='blue'><b>wizard</b></font>) is left with them too long...''

 (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``You made that dementor on the train back off,''  (<font color='red'><b>Harry/Potter/Harry Potter</b></font>)</div>said Harry suddenly.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``There are -- certain defenses one can use,''  (<font color='red'><b>Lupin/R. J. Lupin</b></font>)</div>said Lupin. <div class="bookquote">``But there was
only one dementor on the train. The more there are, the more difficult
it becomes to resist.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``What defenses?''  (<font color='red'><b>Harry/Potter/Harry Potter</b></font>)</div>said Harry at once. <div class="bookquote">``Can you teach me?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I don't pretend to be an expert at fighting dementors, Harry, quite the
contrary...''

 (<font color='red'><b>Lupin/R. J. Lupin</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``But if the dementors come to another Quidditch match, I need to be able
to fight them --''

 (<font color='red'><b>Lupin/R. J. Lupin</b></font>)</div><p/>Lupin looked into Harry's determined face, hesitated, then said,
<div class="bookquote">``Well... all right. I'll try and help. But it'll have to wait until next
term, I'm afraid. I have a lot to do before the holidays. I chose a very
inconvenient time to fall ill.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Harry/Potter/Harry Potter</b></font>)</div><p/>What with the promise of anti-dementor lessons from Lupin, the thought
that he (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) might never have to hear his (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) mother's death again, and the fact
that Ravenclaw flattened Hufflepuff in their Quidditch match at the end
of November, Harry's mood took a definite upturn. Gryffindor were not
out of the running after all, although they could not afford to lose
another match. Wood became repossessed of his (<font color='blue'><b>Wood</b></font>) manic energy, and worked
his (<font color='blue'><b>Wood</b></font>) team as hard as ever in the chilly haze of rain that persisted into
December. Harry saw no hint of a dementor within the grounds.
Dumbledore's anger seemed to be keeping them at their stations at the
entrances.

<p/>Two weeks before the end of the term, the sky lightened suddenly to a
dazzling, opaline white and the muddy grounds were revealed one morning
covered in glittering frost. Inside the castle, there was a buzz of
Christmas in the air. Professor Flitwick, the Charms teacher, had
already decorated his (<font color='blue'><b>Professor</b></font>) classroom with shimmering lights that turned out
to be real, fluttering fairies. The students were all happily discussing
their plans for the holidays. Both Ron and Hermione had decided to
remain at Hogwarts, and though Ron said it was because he (<font color='blue'><b>Ron</b></font>) couldn't stand
two weeks with Percy, and Hermione insisted she (<font color='blue'><b>Hermione</b></font>) needed to use the
library, Harry wasn't fooled; they were doing it to keep him (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) company,
and he (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) was very grateful.

<p/>To everyone's delight except Harry's, there was to be another Hogsmeade
trip on the very last weekend of the term.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``We can do all our Christmas shopping there!''  (<font color='red'><b>Hermione/HERMIONE</b></font>)</div>said Hermione. <div class="bookquote">``Mum and
Dad would really love those Toothflossing Stringmints from Honeydukes!''

 (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div><p/>Resigned to the fact that he (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) would be the only third year staying behind
again, Harry borrowed a copy of Which Broomstick from Wood, and decided
to spend the day reading up on the different makes. He (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) had been riding
one of the school brooms at team practice, an ancient Shooting Star,
which was very slow and jerky; he (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) definitely needed a new broom of his (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>)
own.

<p/>On the Saturday morning of the Hogsmeade trip, Harry bid good-bye to Ron
and Hermione, who were wrapped in cloaks and scarves, then turned up the
marble staircase alone, and headed back toward Gryffindor Tower. Snow
had started to fall outside the windows, and the castle was very still
and quiet.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Psst -- Harry!''

 (<font color='red'><b>He</b></font>)</div><p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Snow</b></font>) turned, halfway along the third-floor corridor, to see Fred and
George peering out at him (<font color='blue'><b>Fred</b></font>) from behind a statue of a humpbacked, one-eyed
witch.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``What are you doing?''  (<font color='red'><b>Harry/Potter/Harry Potter</b></font>)</div>said Harry curiously. <div class="bookquote">``How come you're not going
to Hogsmeade?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``We've come to give you a bit of festive cheer before we go,''  (<font color='red'><b>Fred/Fred Weasley</b></font>)</div>said Fred,
with a mysterious wink. <div class="bookquote">``Come in here...''

 (<font color='red'><b>He</b></font>)</div><p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Fred</b></font>) nodded toward an empty classroom to the left of the one-eyed statue.
Harry followed Fred and George inside. George closed the door quietly
and then turned, beaming, to look at Harry.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Early Christmas present for you, Harry,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) said.

<p/>Fred pulled something from inside his (<font color='blue'><b>Fred</b></font>) cloak with a flourish and laid it
on one of the desks. It was a large, square, very worn piece of
parchment with nothing written on it. Harry, suspecting one of Fred and
George's jokes, stared at it.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``What's that supposed to be?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``This, Harry, is the secret of our success,''  (<font color='red'><b>George/George Weasley/Weasley</b></font>)</div>said George, patting the
parchment fondly.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``It's a wrench, giving it to you,''  (<font color='red'><b>Fred/Fred Weasley</b></font>)</div>said Fred, <div class="bookquote">``but we decided last
night, your need's greater than ours.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Fred/Fred Weasley</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Anyway, we know it by heart,''  (<font color='red'><b>George/George Weasley/Weasley</b></font>)</div>said George. <div class="bookquote">``We bequeath it to you. We
don't really need it anymore.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``And what do I need with a bit of old parchment?''  (<font color='red'><b>Harry/Potter/Harry Potter</b></font>)</div>said Harry.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``A bit of old parchment!''  (<font color='red'><b>Fred/Fred Weasley</b></font>)</div>said Fred, closing his (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) eyes with a grimace as
though Harry had mortally offended him (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>). <div class="bookquote">``Explain, George.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Well... when we were in our first year, Harry -- young, carefree, and
innocent --''

 (<font color='red'><b>Harry/Potter/Harry Potter</b></font>)</div><p/>Harry snorted. He (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) doubted whether Fred and George had ever been
innocent.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Well, more innocent than we are now -- we got into a spot of bother
with Filch.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``We let off a Dungbomb in the corridor and it upset him (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) for some reason
--''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``So he (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) hauled us off to his (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) office and started threatening us with the
usual --''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>detention disembowelment and we couldn't help noticing a
drawer in one of his (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) filing cabinets marked Confiscated and Highly
Dangerous.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Don't tell me --''  (<font color='red'><b>Harry/Potter/Harry Potter</b></font>)</div>said Harry, starting to grin.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Well, what would you've done?''  (<font color='red'><b>Fred/Fred Weasley</b></font>)</div>said Fred. <div class="bookquote">``George caused a diversion by
dropping another Dungbomb, I whipped the drawer open, and grabbed --
this.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``It's not as bad as it sounds, you know,''  (<font color='red'><b>George/George Weasley/Weasley</b></font>)</div>said George. <div class="bookquote">``We don't reckon
Filch ever found out how to work it. He (<font color='blue'><b>George</b></font>) probably suspected what it was,
though, or he (<font color='blue'><b>George</b></font>) wouldn't have confiscated it.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``And you know how to work it?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Oh yes,''  (<font color='red'><b>Fred/Fred Weasley</b></font>)</div>said Fred, smirking. <div class="bookquote">``This little beauty's taught us more than
all the teachers in this school.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``You're winding me up,''  (<font color='red'><b>Harry/Potter/Harry Potter</b></font>)</div>said Harry, looking at the ragged old bit of
parchment.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Oh, are we?''  (<font color='red'><b>George/George Weasley/Weasley</b></font>)</div>said George.

<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>George</b></font>) took out his (<font color='blue'><b>George</b></font>) wand, touched the parchment lightly, and said, <div class="bookquote">``I
solemnly swear that I am up to no good.''

 (<font color='red'><b>He</b></font>)</div><p/>And at once, thin ink lines began to spread like a spider's web from the
point that George's wand had touched. They joined each other, they
crisscrossed, they fanned into every corner of the parchment; then words
began to blossom across the top, great, curly green words, that
proclaimed:

<p/>Messrs. Moony, Wormtail, Padfoot, and Prongs

<p/>Purveyors of Aids to Magical Mischief-Makers are proud to present THE
MARAUDER``S MAP

<p/>It was a map showing every detail of the Hogwarts castle and grounds.
But the truly remarkable thing were the tiny ink dots moving around it,
each labeled with a name in minuscule writing. Astounded, Harry bent
over it. A labeled dot in the top left corner showed that Professor
Dumbledore was pacing his (<font color='blue'><b>Dumbledore</b></font>) study; the caretaker's cat, Mrs. Norris, was
prowling the second floor; and Peeves the Poltergeist was currently
bouncing around the trophy room. And as Harry's eyes traveled up and
down the familiar corridors, he (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) noticed something else.

<p/>This map showed a set of passages he (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) had never entered. And many of them
seemed to lead -

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Right into Hogsmeade,''  (<font color='red'><b>Fred/Fred Weasley</b></font>)</div>said Fred, tracing one of them with his (<font color='blue'><b>Fred</b></font>) finger.
<div class="bookquote">``There are seven in all. Now, Filch knows about these four''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>-- he (<font color='blue'><b>Fred</b></font>)
pointed them out -- <div class="bookquote">``but we're sure we're the only ones who know about
these. Don't bother with the one behind the mirror on the fourth floor.
We used it until last winter, but it's caved in -- completely blocked.
And we don't reckon anyone's ever used this one, because the Whomping
Willow's planted right over the entrance. But this one here, this one
leads right into the cellar of Honeydukes. We've used it loads of times.
And as you might've noticed, the entrance is right outside this room,
through that one-eyed old crone's hump.''

 (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Moony, Wormtaill Padfoot, and Prongs,''  (<font color='red'><b>George/George Weasley/Weasley</b></font>)</div>sighed George, patting the
heading of the map. <div class="bookquote">``We owe them so much.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Noble men, working tirelessly to help a new generation of lawbreakers,''
 (<font color='red'><b>Fred/Fred Weasley</b></font>)</div>said Fred solemnly.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Right,''  (<font color='red'><b>George/George Weasley/Weasley</b></font>)</div>said George briskly. <div class="bookquote">``Don't forget to wipe it after you've used
it or anyone can read it,''  (<font color='red'><b>Fred/Fred Weasley</b></font>)</div>Fred said warningly.

<p/>``Just tap it again and say, ``Mischief managed!<div class="bookquote">'' And it'll go blank.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``So, young Harry,''  (<font color='red'><b>Fred/Fred Weasley</b></font>)</div>said Fred, in an uncanny impersonation of Percy,
<div class="bookquote">``mind you behave yourself.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Percy/Weasley/Percy Weasley</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``See you in Honeydukes,''  (<font color='red'><b>George/George Weasley/Weasley</b></font>)</div>said George, winking.

<p/>They left the room, both smirking in a satisfied sort of way.

<p/>Harry stood there, gazing at the miraculous map. He (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) watched the tiny ink
Mrs. Norris turn left and pause to sniff at something on the floor. If
Filch really didn't know... he (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) wouldn't have to pass the dementors at
all...

<p/>But even as he (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) stood there, flooded with excitement, something Harry had
once heard Mr. Weasley say came floating out of his (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) memory.

<p/>Never trust anything that can think for itself, if you can't see where
it keeps its brain.

<p/>This map was one of those dangerous magical objects Mr. Weasley had been
warning against... Aids for Magical Mischief Makers... but then, Harry
reasoned, he (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) only wanted to use it to get into Hogsmeade, it wasn't as
though he (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) wanted to steal anything or attack anyone... and Fred and
George had been using it for years without anything horrible
happening...

<p/>Harry traced the secret passage to Honeydukes with his (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) finger.

<p/>Then, quite suddenly, as though following orders, he (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) rolled up the map,
stuffed it inside his (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) robes, and hurried to the door of the classroom.
He (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) opened it a couple of inches. There was no one outside. Very
carefully, he (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) edged out of the room and behind the statue of the
one-eyed witch.

<p/>What did he (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) have to do? He (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) pulled out the map again and saw to his (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>)
astonishment, that a new ink figure had appeared upon it, labeled Harry
Potter. This figure was standing exactly where the real Harry was
standing, about halfway down the third-floor corridor.

<p/>Harry watched carefully. His (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) little Ink self appeared to be tapping the
witch with his (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) minute wand. Harry quickly took out his (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) real wand and
tapped the statue. Nothing happened. He (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) looked back at the map. The
tiniest speech bubble had appeared next to his (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) figure. The word inside
said, <div class="bookquote">``Dissendium.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Dissendium!''  (<font color='red'><b>Harry/Potter/Harry Potter</b></font>)</div>Harry whispered, tapping the stone witch again.

<p/>At once, the statue's hump opened wide enough to admit a fairly thin
person. Harry glanced quickly up and down the corridor, then tucked the
map away again, hoisted himself into the hole headfirst, and pushed
himself forward.

<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) slid a considerable way down what felt like a stone slide, then
landed on cold, damp earth. He (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) stood up, looking around. It was

<p/>pitch dark. He (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) held up his (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) wand, muttered, <div class="bookquote">``Lumos! ''  (<font color='red'><b>He</b></font>)</div>and saw that he (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) was
in a very narrow, low, earthy passageway. He (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) raised the map, tapped it
with the tip of his (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) wand, and muttered, <div class="bookquote">``Mischief managed!''  (<font color='red'><b>He</b></font>)</div>The map went
blank at once. He (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) folded it carefully, tucked it inside his (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) robes, then,
heart beating fast, both excited and apprehensive, he (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) set off.

<p/>The passage twisted and turned, more like the burrow of a giant rabbit
than anything else. Harry hurried along it, stumbling now and then on
the uneven floor, holding his (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) wand out in front of him (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>).

<p/>It took ages, but Harry had the thought of Honeydukes to sustain him (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>).
After what felt like an hour, the passage began to rise. Panting, Harry
sped up, his (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) face hot, his (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) feet very cold.

<p/>Ten minutes later, he (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) came to the foot of some worn stone steps, which
rose out of sight above him (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>). Careful not to make any noise, Harry began
to climb. A hundred steps, two hundred steps, he (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) lost count as he (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>)
climbed, watching his (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) feet... Then, without warning, his (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) head hit
something hard.

<p/>It seemed to be a trapdoor. Harry stood there, massaging the top of his (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>)
head, listening. He (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) couldn't hear any sounds above him (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>). Very slowly, he (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>)
pushed the trapdoor open and peered over the edge.

<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) was in a cellar, which was full of wooden crates and boxes. Harry
climbed out of the trapdoor and replaced it -- it blended so perfectly
with the dusty floor that it was impossible to tell it was there. Harry
crept slowly toward the wooden staircase that led upstairs. Now he (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) could
definitely hear voices, not to mention the tinkle of a bell and the
opening and shutting of a door.

<p/>Wondering what he (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) ought to do, he (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) suddenly heard a door open much closer
at hand; somebody was about to come downstairs.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``And get another box of Jelly Slugs, dear, they've nearly cleaned us out
--''  (<font color='red'><b>a woman</b></font>)</div>said a woman's voice.

<p/>A pair of feet was coming down the staircase. Harry leapt behind an
enormous crate and waited for the footsteps to pass. He (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) heard the man
shifting boxes against the opposite wall. He (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) might not get another
chance --

<p/>Quickly and silently, Harry dodged out from his (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) hiding place and climbed
the stairs; looking back, he (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) saw an enormous backside and shiny bald
head, buried in a box. Harry reached the door at the top of the stairs,
slipped through it, and found himself behind the counter of Honeydukes
-- he (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) ducked, crept sideways, and then straightened up.

<p/>Honeydukes was so crowded with Hogwarts students that no one looked
twice at Harry. He (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) edged among them, looking around, and suppressed a
laugh as he (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) imagined the look that would spread over Dudley's piggy face
if he (<font color='blue'><b>Dudley</b></font>) could see where Harry was now.

<p/>There were shelves upon shelves of the most succulent-looking sweets
imaginable. Creamy chunks of nougat, shimmering pink squares of coconut
ice, fat, honey-colored toffees; hundreds of different kinds of
chocolate in neat rows; there was a large barrel of Every Flavor Beans,
and another of Fizzing Whizbees, the levitating sherbert balls that Ron
had mentioned; along yet another wall were <div class="bookquote">``Special Effects''  (<font color='red'><b>Ron</b></font>)</div>-- sweets:
Droobles Best Blowing Gum -LRB-which filled a room with bluebell-colored
bubbles that refused to pop for days-RRB-, the strange, splintery
Toothflossing Stringmints, tiny black Pepper Imps -LRB-<div class="bookquote">``breathe fire for
your friends!'' (<font color='red'><b>Pepper Imps</b></font>)</div>-RRB-, Ice Mice -LRB-<div class="bookquote">``hear your teeth chatter and squeak!'' (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>-RRB-,
peppermint creams shaped like toads -LRB-<div class="bookquote">``hop realistically in the
stomach!'' (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>-RRB-, fragile sugar-spun quills, and exploding bonbons.

<p/>Harry squeezed himself through a crowd of sixth years and saw a sign
hanging in the farthest corner of the shop -LRB-UNUSUAL TASTES-RRB-. Ron and
Hermione were standing underneath it, examining a tray of blood-flavored
lollipops. Harry sneaked up behind them.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Ugh, no, Harry won't want one of those, they're for vampires, I
expect,''  (<font color='red'><b>Hermione/HERMIONE</b></font>)</div>Hermione was saying.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``How about these?''  (<font color='red'><b>Ron</b></font>)</div>said Ron, shoving a jar of Cockroach Clusters under
Hermione's nose.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Definitely not,''  (<font color='red'><b>Harry/Potter/Harry Potter</b></font>)</div>said Harry.

<p/>Ron nearly dropped the jar.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Harry!''  (<font color='red'><b>Hermione/HERMIONE</b></font>)</div>squealed Hermione. <div class="bookquote">``What are you doing here? How -- how did you
--?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Wow!''  (<font color='red'><b>Ron</b></font>)</div>said Ron, looking very impressed, <div class="bookquote">``you've learned to Apparate!''

 (<font color='red'><b>Ron</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">''`Course I haven't,''  (<font color='red'><b>Ron</b></font>)</div>said Harry. He (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) dropped his (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) voice so that none of
the sixth years could hear him (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) and told them all about the Marauder's
Map.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``How come Fred and George never gave it to me!''  (<font color='red'><b>Ron</b></font>)</div>said Ron, outraged. <div class="bookquote">``I'm
their brother!''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``But Harry isn't going to keep it!''  (<font color='red'><b>Hermione/HERMIONE</b></font>)</div>said Hermione, as though the idea
were ludicrous. <div class="bookquote">``He (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>)'s going to hand it in to Professor McGonagall,
aren't you, Harry?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``No, I'm not!''  (<font color='red'><b>Harry/Potter/Harry Potter</b></font>)</div>said Harry.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Are you mad?''  (<font color='red'><b>Ron</b></font>)</div>said Ron, goggling at Hermione. <div class="bookquote">``Hand in something that
good?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``If I hand it in, I'll have to say where I got it! Filch would know Fred
and George had nicked it!''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``But what about Sirius Black?''  (<font color='red'><b>Hermione/HERMIONE</b></font>)</div>Hermione hissed. <div class="bookquote">``He (<font color='blue'><b>Black</b></font>) could be using one
of the passages on that map to get into the castle! The teachers have
got to know!''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``He (<font color='blue'><b>Black</b></font>) can't be getting in through a passage,''  (<font color='red'><b>Harry/Potter/Harry Potter</b></font>)</div>said Harry quickly. <div class="bookquote">``There
are seven secret tunnels on the map, right? Fred and George reckon Filch
already knows about four of them. And of the other three -- one of
them's caved in, so no one can get through it. one of them's got the
Whomping Willow planted over the entrance, so you can't get out of it.
And the one I just came through -well - - it's really hard to see the
entrance to it down in the cellar, so unless he (<font color='blue'><b>Fred</b></font>) knew it was there...''

 (<font color='red'><b>Harry/Potter/Harry Potter</b></font>)</div><p/>Harry hesistated. What if Black did know the passage was there?

<p/>Ron, however, cleared his (<font color='blue'><b>Ron</b></font>) throat significantly, and pointed to a notice
pasted on the inside of the sweetshop door.

<p/>--------BY ORDER OF -------- THE MINISTRY OF MAGIC

<p/>Customers are reminded that until further notice, dementors will be
patrolling the streets of Hogsmeade every night after sundown. This
measure has been put in place for the safety of Hogsmeade residents and
will be lifted upon the recapture of Sirius Black. It is therefore
advisable that you complete your shopping well before nightfall.

<p/>Merry Christmas!

<p/><div class="bookquote">``See?''  (<font color='red'><b>Ron</b></font>)</div>said Ron quietly. <div class="bookquote">``I'd like to see Black try and break into
Honeydukes with dementors swarming all over the village. Anyway,
Hermione, the Honeydukes owners would hear a break-in, wouldn't they?
They live over the shop!''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Yes, but but --''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>Hermoine seemed to be struggling to find another
problem. <div class="bookquote">``Look, Harry still shouldn't be coming into Hogsmeade. He (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>)
hasn't got a signed form! If anyone finds out, he (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>)'ll be in so much
trouble! And it's not nightfall yet -- what if Sirius Black turns up
today? Now?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``He (<font color='blue'><b>Black</b></font>)'d have a job spotting Harry in this,''  (<font color='red'><b>Ron</b></font>)</div>said Ron, nodding through the
mullioned windows at the thick, swirling snow. <div class="bookquote">``Come on, Hermione, it's
Christmas. Harry deserves a break.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Hermione/HERMIONE</b></font>)</div><p/>Hermione bit her (<font color='blue'><b>Hermione</b></font>) lip, looking extremely worried.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Are you going to report me?''  (<font color='red'><b>Harry/Potter/Harry Potter</b></font>)</div>Harry asked her (<font color='blue'><b>Hermione</b></font>), grinning.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Oh -- of course not -- but honestly, Harry --''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Seen the Fizzing Whizbees, Harry?''  (<font color='red'><b>Ron</b></font>)</div>said Ron, grabbing him (<font color='blue'><b>Ron</b></font>) and leading
him (<font color='blue'><b>Ron</b></font>) over to their barrel. <div class="bookquote">``And the Jelly Slugs? And the Acid Pops? Fred
gave me one of those when I was seven -- it burnt a hole right through
my tongue. I remember Mum walloping him (<font color='blue'><b>Fred</b></font>) with her (<font color='blue'><b>Hermione</b></font>) broomstick.''  (<font color='red'><b>Ron</b></font>)</div>Ron stared
broodingly into the Acid Pop box. <div class="bookquote">``Reckon Fred'd take a bit of Cockroach
Cluster if I told him (<font color='blue'><b>Fred</b></font>) they were peanuts?''

 (<font color='red'><b>Ron</b></font>)</div><p/>When Ron and Hermione had paid for all their sweets, the three of them
left Honeydukes for the blizzard outside.

<p/>Hogsmeade looked like a Christmas card; the little thatched cottages and
shops were all covered in a layer of crisp snow; there were holly
wreaths on the doors and strings of enchanted candles hanging in the
trees.

<p/>Harry shivered; unlike the other two, he (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) didn't have his (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) cloak. They
headed up the street, heads bowed against the wind, Ron and Hermione
shouting through their scarves.

<p/>``That's the post office

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Zonko's is up there --''

 (<font color='red'><b>Ron</b></font>)</div><p/>``We could go up to the Shrieking Shack

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Tell you what,''  (<font color='red'><b>Ron</b></font>)</div>said Ron, his (<font color='blue'><b>Ron</b></font>) teeth chattering, <div class="bookquote">``shall we go for a
butterbeer in the Three Broomsticks?''

 (<font color='red'><b>Ron</b></font>)</div><p/>Harry was more than willing; the wind was fierce and his (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) hands were
freezing, so they crossed the road, and in a few minutes were entering
the tiny inn.

<p/>It was extremely crowded, noisy, warm, and smoky. A curvy sort of woman
with a pretty face was serving a bunch of rowdy warlock' up at the bar.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``That's Madam Rosmerta,''  (<font color='red'><b>Ron</b></font>)</div>said Ron. <div class="bookquote">``I'll get the drinks, shall I?''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Ron</b></font>)
added, going slightly red.

<p/>Harry and Hermione made their way to the back of the room, ,,her (<font color='blue'><b>Hermione</b></font>), there
was a small, vacant table between the window and a handsome Christmas
tree, which stood next to the fireplace. Ron came back five minutes
later, carrying three foaming tankards of hot butterbeer.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Merry Christmas!''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Ron</b></font>) said happily, raising his (<font color='blue'><b>Ron</b></font>) tankard.

<p/>Harry drank deeply. It was the most delicious thing he (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>)'d ever tasted and
seemed to heat every bit of him (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) from the inside.

<p/>A sudden breeze ruffled his (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) hair. The door of the Three Broomsticks had
opened again. Harry looked over the rim of his (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) tankard and choked.

<p/>Professors McGonagall and Flitwick had just entered the pub with a
flurry of snowflakes, shortly followed by Hagrid, who was deep in
conversation with a portly man in a lime-green bowler hat and a
pinstriped cloak -- Cornelius Fudge, Minister of Magic.

<p/>In an instant, Ron and Hermione had both placed hands on the top of
Harry's head and forced him (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) off his (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) stool and under the table. Dripping
with butterbeer and crouching out of sight, Harry clutched his (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) empty
tankard and watched the teachers' and Fudge's feet move toward the bar,
pause, then turn and walk right toward him (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>).

<p/>Somewhere above him (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>), Hermione whispered, Mobiliarbus!''

<p/>The Christmas tree beside their table rose a few inches off the ground,
drifted sideways, and landed with a soft thump right in front of their
table, hiding them from view. Staring through the dense lower branches,
Harry saw four sets of chair legs move back from the table right beside
theirs, then heard the grunts and sighs If the teachers and minister as
they sat down.

<p/>Next he (<font color='blue'><b>minister</b></font>) saw another pair of feet, wearing sparkly turquoise high heels,
and heard a woman's voice. <div class="bookquote">``A small gillywater --''

 (<font color='red'><b>Professor</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Mine,''  (<font color='red'><b>Professor</b></font>)</div>said Professor McGonagall's voice.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Four pints of mulled mead --''

 (<font color='red'><b>Hagrid</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Ta, Rosmerta,''  (<font color='red'><b>Hagrid</b></font>)</div>said Hagrid.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``A cherry syrup and soda with ice and umbrella --''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Mmm!''  (<font color='red'><b>Professor</b></font>)</div>said Professor Flitwick, smacking his (<font color='blue'><b>Professor</b></font>) lips.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``So you'll be the red currant rum, Minister.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Thank you, Rosmerta, m`dear,''  (<font color='red'><b>Fudge</b></font>)</div>said Fudge's voice. <div class="bookquote">``Lovely to see you
again, I must say. Have one yourself, won't you? Come and join us...''

 (<font color='red'><b>Harry/Potter/Harry Potter</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Well, thank you very much, Minister.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Harry/Potter/Harry Potter</b></font>)</div><p/>Harry watched the glittering heels march away and back again. His (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) heart
was pounding uncomfortably in his (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) throat. Why hadn't it occurred to him (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>)
that this was the last weekend of term for the teachers to& And how long
were they going to sit there? He (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) needed time to sneak back into
Honeydukes if he (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) wanted to return to school tonight... Hermione's leg
gave a nervous twitch next to him (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>).

<p/><div class="bookquote">``So, what brings you to this neck of the woods, Minister?''  (<font color='red'><b>Madam Rosmerta/Rosmerta</b></font>)</div>came Madam
Rosmerta's voice.

<p/>Harry saw the lower part of Fudge's thick body twist in his (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) chair as
though he (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) were checking for eavesdroppers. Then he (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) said in a quiet
voice, <div class="bookquote">``What else, m`dear, but Sirius Black? I daresay you heard what
happened up at the school at Halloween?''

 (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div><p/>I did hear a rumor,'' admitted Madam Rosmerta.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Did you tell the whole pub, Hagrid?''  (<font color='red'><b>Professor</b></font>)</div>said Professor McGonagall
exasperatedly.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Do you think Blacks still in the area, Minister?''  (<font color='red'><b>Madam Rosmerta/Rosmerta</b></font>)</div>whispered Madam
Rosmerta.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``I'm sure of it,''  (<font color='red'><b>Fudge</b></font>)</div>said Fudge shortly.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``You know that the dementors have searched the whole village twjce?''
 (<font color='red'><b>Madam Rosmerta/Rosmerta</b></font>)</div>said Madam Rosmerta, a slight edge to her (<font color='blue'><b>Rosmerta</b></font>) voice. <div class="bookquote">``Scared all my
customers away... It's very bad for business, Minister.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Rosmerta, dear, I don't like them any more than you do,''  (<font color='red'><b>Fudge</b></font>)</div>said Fudge
uncomfortably. <div class="bookquote">``Necessary precaution... unfortunate, but there YOU
are... I've just met some of them. They're in a fury against Dumbledore
-- he (<font color='blue'><b>Dumbledore</b></font>) won't let them inside the castle grounds.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I should think not,''  (<font color='red'><b>Professor</b></font>)</div>said Professor McGonagall sharply. <div class="bookquote">``How are we
supposed to teach with those horrors floating around?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Hear, hear!''  (<font color='red'><b>Professor</b></font>)</div>squeaked tiny Professor Flitwick, whose feet were dangling
a foot from the ground.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``All the same,''  (<font color='red'><b>Fudge</b></font>)</div>demurred Fudge, <div class="bookquote">``they are here to protect you all from
something much worse... We all know what Black's capable of...''

 (<font color='red'><b>Fudge</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Do you know, I still have trouble believing it,''  (<font color='red'><b>Fudge</b></font>)</div>said Madam Rosmerta
thoughtfully. <div class="bookquote">``Of all the people to go over to the Dark Side, Sirius
Black was the last I'd have thought... I mean, I remember him (<font color='blue'><b>Black</b></font>) when he (<font color='blue'><b>Black</b></font>)

become, I'd have said you'd had too much mead.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``You don't know the half of it, Rosmerta,''  (<font color='red'><b>Fudge</b></font>)</div>said Fudge gruffly. <div class="bookquote">``The

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``The worst?''  (<font color='red'><b>Madam Rosmerta/Rosmerta</b></font>)</div>said Madam Rosmerta, her (<font color='blue'><b>Rosmerta</b></font>) voice alive with curiosity, <div class="bookquote">``Worse

 (<font color='red'><b>Madam Rosmerta/Rosmerta</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I certainly do,''  (<font color='red'><b>Fudge</b></font>)</div>said Fudge.

<p/>``I ca``A believe that. What could possibly be worse?'' ``You say you

<div class="bookquote">``Do you remember who his-best friend was?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Naturally,''  (<font color='red'><b>Madam Rosmerta/Rosmerta</b></font>)</div>said Madam Rosmerta, with a small laugh. <div class="bookquote">``Never saw one

 (<font color='red'><b>Harry/Potter/Harry Potter</b></font>)</div><p/>Harry dropped his (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) tankard with a loud clunk. Ron kicked him (<font color='blue'><b>Ron</b></font>).

advised them to go into hiding. Well, of course, You-Know-Who wasn't an
easy person to hide from. Dumbledore told them that their best chance
was the Fidelius Charm.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``How does that work?''  (<font color='red'><b>Madam Rosmerta/Rosmerta</b></font>)</div>said Madam Rosmerta, breathless with interest.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``An immensely complex spell,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Professor</b></font>) said squeakily, <div class="bookquote">``involving the magical

crater in the middle of the street, so deep it had cracked the sewer
below. Bodies everywhere. Muggles screaming. And Black standing there
laughing, with what was left of Pettigrew in front of him (<font color='blue'><b>Pettigrew</b></font>)... a heap of
bloodstained robes and a few -- a few fragments --''

 (<font color='red'><b>Fudge</b></font>)</div><p/>Fudge's voice stopped abruptly. There was the sound of five noses being
blown.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Well, there you have it, Rosmerta,''  (<font color='red'><b>Fudge</b></font>)</div>said Fudge thickly. ``Black was
taken away by twenty members of the Magical Law Enforcement <div class="bookquote">``Squad and

 (<font color='red'><b>Madam Rosmerta/Rosmerta</b></font>)</div><p/>Madam Rosmerta let out a long sigh.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Is it true he (<font color='blue'><b>Merlin</b></font>)'s mad, Minister?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I wish I could say that he (<font color='blue'><b>Merlin</b></font>) was,''  (<font color='red'><b>Fudge</b></font>)</div>said Fudge slowly. <div class="bookquote">``I certainly

Pettigrew and all those Muggles was the action of a cornered and
desperate man -- cruel... pointless. Yet I met Black on my last
inspection of Azkaban. You know, most of the prisoners in there sit
muttering to themselves in the dark; there's no sense in them... but I
was shocked at how normal Black seemed. He (<font color='blue'><b>Pettigrew</b></font>) spoke quite rationally to me.
It was unnerving. You'd have thought he (<font color='blue'><b>Pettigrew</b></font>) was merely bored -- asked if I'd
finished with my newspaper, cool as you please, said he (<font color='blue'><b>Pettigrew</b></font>) missed doing the
crossword. Yes, I was astounded at how little effect the dementors
seemed to be having on him (<font color='blue'><b>Pettigrew</b></font>) -- and he (<font color='blue'><b>Pettigrew</b></font>) was one of the most heavily guarded
in the place, you know. Dementors outside his (<font color='blue'><b>Pettigrew</b></font>) door day and night.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``But what do you think he (<font color='blue'><b>Pettigrew</b></font>)'s broken out to do?''  (<font color='red'><b>Madam Rosmerta/Rosmerta</b></font>)</div>said Madam Rosmerta.

 (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div><p/>I daresay that is his (<font color='blue'><b>Pettigrew</b></font>) -- er -- eventual plan,'' said Fudge evasively.
<div class="bookquote">``But we hope to catch Black long before that. I must say, You-Know-Who
alone and friendless is one thing... but give him (<font color='blue'><b>Minister</b></font>) back his (<font color='blue'><b>Minister</b></font>) most devoted
servant, and I shudder to think how quickly he (<font color='blue'><b>Minister</b></font>)'ll rise again...''

 (<font color='red'><b>Someone</b></font>)</div><p/>There was a small chink of glass on wood. Someone had set down their
glass.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``You know, Cornelius, if you're dining with the headmaster, he (<font color='blue'><b>Cornelius</b></font>)'d better
head back up to the castle,''  (<font color='red'><b>Professor</b></font>)</div>said Professor McGonagall.

<p/>One by one, the pairs of feet in front of Harry took the weight of their
owners once more; hems of cloaks swung into sight, and Madam Rosemerta's
glittering heels disappeared behind the bar. The door of the Three
Broomsticks opened again, there was another flurry of snow, and the
teachers had disappeared.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Harry?''

 (<font color='red'><b>Ron</b></font>)</div><p/>Ron's and Hermione's faces appeared under the table. They were both
staring at him (<font color='blue'><b>Ron</b></font>), lost for words.

<p/>CHAPTER ELEVEN

<p/>THE FIREBOLT

<p/>Harry didn't have a very clear idea of how he (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) had managed to get back
into the Honeydukes cellar, through the tunnel, and into the castle once
more. All he (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) knew was that the return trip seemed to take no time at
all, and that he (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) hardly noticed what he (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) was doing, because his (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) head was
still pounding with the conversation he (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) had just heard.

<p/>Why had nobody ever told him (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>)? Dumbledore, Hagrid, Mr. Weasley, Cornelius
Fudge... why hadn't anyone ever mentioned the fact that Harry's parents
had died because their best friend had betrayed them?

<p/>Ron and Herinione watched Harry nervously all through dintier, not
daring to talk about what they'd overheard, because Percy was sitting
close by them. When they went upstairs to the crowded common room, it
was to find Fred and George had set off half a dozen Dungbombs in a fit
of end- of-term high spirits. Harry, who didn't want Fred and George
asking him (<font color='blue'><b>Fred</b></font>) whether he (<font color='blue'><b>Fred</b></font>)'d reached Hogsmeade or not, sneaked quietly up to
the empty dormitory and headed straight for his (<font color='blue'><b>Fred</b></font>) bedside cabinet. He (<font color='blue'><b>Fred</b></font>)
pushed his (<font color='blue'><b>Fred</b></font>) books aside and quickly found what he (<font color='blue'><b>Fred</b></font>) was looking for -- the
leather-bound photo album Hagrid had given him (<font color='blue'><b>Fred</b></font>) two years ago, which was
full of wizard pictures of his (<font color='blue'><b>wizard</b></font>) mother and father. He (<font color='blue'><b>wizard</b></font>) sat down on his (<font color='blue'><b>wizard</b></font>)
bed, drew the hangings around him (<font color='blue'><b>wizard</b></font>), and started turning the pages,
searching, until...

<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>wizard</b></font>) stopped on a picture of his (<font color='blue'><b>wizard</b></font>) parents' wedding day. There was his (<font color='blue'><b>wizard</b></font>)
father waving up at him (<font color='blue'><b>wizard</b></font>), beaming, the untidy black hair Harry had
inherited standing up in all directions. There was his (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) mother, alight
with happiness, arm in arm with his (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) dad. And there ... that must be him (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>).
Their best man... Harry had never given him (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) a thought before.

<p/>If he (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) hadn't known it was the same person, he (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) would never have guessed
it was Black in this old photograph. His (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) face wasn't sunken and waxy,
but handsome, full of laughter. Had he (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) already been working for
Voldemort when this picture had been taken? Was he (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) already planning the
deaths of the two people next to him (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>)? Did he (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) realize he (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) was facing
twelve years in Azkaban, twelve years that would make him (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>)
unrecognizable?

<p/>But the dementors don't affect him (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>), Harry thought, staring into the
handsome, laughing face. He (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) doesn't have to hear my Min screaming if
they get too close -

<p/>Harry slammed the album shut, reached over and stuffed it back into his (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>)
cabinet, took off his (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) robe and glasses and got into bed, making sure the
hangings were hiding him (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) from view.

<p/>The dormitory door opened.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Harry?''  (<font color='red'><b>Ron</b></font>)</div>said Ron's voice uncertainly.

<p/>But Harry still, pretending to be asleep. He (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) heard Ron leave again, and
rolled over on his (<font color='blue'><b>Ron</b></font>) back, his (<font color='blue'><b>Ron</b></font>) eyes wide open.

<p/>A hatred such as he (<font color='blue'><b>Ron</b></font>) had never known before was coursing through Harry
like poison. He (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) could see Black laughing at him (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) through the darkness, as
though somebody had pasted the picture from the album over his (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) eyes. He (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>)
watched, as though somebody was playing him (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) a piece of film, Sirius
Black blasting Peter Pettigrew -LRB-who resembled Neville Longbottom-RRB- into a
thousand pieces. He (<font color='blue'><b>Longbottom</b></font>) could hear -LRB-though having no idea what Black's voice
might sound like-RRB- a low, excited mutter. ``It has happened, My Lord...
the Potters have made me their Secret-Keeper and then came another
voice, laughing shrilly, the same laugh that Harry heard inside his (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) head
whenever the dementors drew near...

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Harry, you -- you look terrible.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Harry/Potter/Harry Potter</b></font>)</div><p/>Harry hadn't gotten to sleep until daybreak. He (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) had awoken to find the
dormitory deserted, dressed, and gone down the spiral staircase to a
common room that was completely empty except for Ron, who was eating a
Peppermint Toad and massaging his (<font color='blue'><b>Ron</b></font>) stomach, and Hermione, who had spread
her (<font color='blue'><b>Hermione</b></font>) homework over three tables.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Where is everyone?''  (<font color='red'><b>Harry/Potter/Harry Potter</b></font>)</div>said Harry.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Gone! It's the first day of the holidays, remember?''  (<font color='red'><b>Ron</b></font>)</div>said Ron, watching
Harry closely. <div class="bookquote">``It's nearly lunchtime; I was going to come and wake you
up in a minute.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Harry/Potter/Harry Potter</b></font>)</div><p/>Harry slumped into a chair next to the fire. Snow was still falling
outside the windows. Crookshanks was spread out in front of the fire
like a large, ginger rug.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``You really don' look well, you know,''  (<font color='red'><b>Hermione/HERMIONE</b></font>)</div>Hermione said, peering anxiously
into his (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) face.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``I'm fine,''  (<font color='red'><b>Harry/Potter/Harry Potter</b></font>)</div>said Harry.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Harry, listen,''  (<font color='red'><b>Hermione/HERMIONE</b></font>)</div>said Hermione, exchanging a look with Ron, you must be
really upset about what we heard yesterday. But the thing is, you
mustn't go doing anything stupid.''

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Like what?''  (<font color='red'><b>Harry/Potter/Harry Potter</b></font>)</div>said Harry.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Like trying to go after Black,''  (<font color='red'><b>Ron</b></font>)</div>said Ron sharply.

<p/>Harry could tell they had rehearsed this conversation while he (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) had been
asleep. He (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) didn't say anything.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``You won't, will you, Harry?''  (<font color='red'><b>Hermione/HERMIONE</b></font>)</div>said Hermione.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Because Black's not worth dying for,''  (<font color='red'><b>Ron</b></font>)</div>said Ron.

<p/>Harry looked at them. They didn't seem to understand at all.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``D'you know what I see and hear every time a dementor gets too near me?''
 (<font color='red'><b>Ron</b></font>)</div>Ron and Hermione shook their heads, looking apprehensive. <div class="bookquote">``I can hear my
mum screaming and pleading with Voldemort. And if you'd heard your mum
screaming like that, just about to be killed, you wouldn't forget it in
a hurry. And if you found out someone who was supposed to be a friend of
hers betrayed her (<font color='blue'><b>mum</b></font>) and sent Voldemort after her (<font color='blue'><b>mum</b></font>) --''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``There's nothing you can do!''  (<font color='red'><b>Hermione/HERMIONE</b></font>)</div>said Hermione, looking stricken. <div class="bookquote">``The
dementors will catch Black and he (<font color='blue'><b>Black</b></font>)'ll go back to Azkaban and -- and serve
him (<font color='blue'><b>Black</b></font>) right!''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``You heard what Fudge said. Black isn't affected by Azkaban like normal
people are. It's not a punishment for him (<font color='blue'><b>Black</b></font>) like it is for the others.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``So what are you saying?''  (<font color='red'><b>Ron</b></font>)</div>said Ron, looking very tense. <div class="bookquote">``You want to --
to kill Black or something?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Don't be silly,''  (<font color='red'><b>Herinione</b></font>)</div>said Herinione in a panicky voice. <div class="bookquote">``Harry doesn't want
to kill anyone, do you, Harry?''

 (<font color='red'><b>Harry/Potter/Harry Potter</b></font>)</div><p/>Again, Harry didn't answer. He (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) didn't know what he (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) wanted to do. All he (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>)
knew was that the idea of doing nothing, while Black was at liberty, was
almost more than he (<font color='blue'><b>Black</b></font>) could stand.

<p/>Malfoy knows,'' he (<font color='blue'><b>Malfoy</b></font>) said abruptly. ``Remember what he (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) said to me in
Potions? ``If it was me, I'd hunt him (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) down myself... I'd want revenge.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``You're going to take Malfoy's advice instead of ours?''  (<font color='red'><b>Ron</b></font>)</div>said Ron
furiously. <div class="bookquote">``Listen... you know what Pettigrew's mother got back after
Black had finished with him (<font color='blue'><b>Black</b></font>)? Dad told me -- the Order of Merlin, First
Class, and Pettigrew's finger in a box. That was the biggest bit of him (<font color='blue'><b>Pettigrew</b></font>)
they could find. Black's a madman, Harry, and he (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>)'s dangerous --''

 (<font color='red'><b>Harry/Potter/Harry Potter</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Malfoy's dad must have told him (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>),''  (<font color='red'><b>Harry/Potter/Harry Potter</b></font>)</div>said Harry, ignoring Ron. <div class="bookquote">``He (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) was
right in Voldemort's inner circle --''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Say You-Know-Who, will you?''  (<font color='red'><b>Ron</b></font>)</div>interjected Ron angrily.

<p/><div class="bookquote">''-- so obviously, the Malfoys knew Black was working for Voldemort --''

 (<font color='red'><b>Ron</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">''-- and Malfoy'd love to see you blown into about a million pieces, like
Pettigrew! Get a grip. Malfoy's just hoping you'll get Yourself killed
before he (<font color='blue'><b>Malfoy</b></font>) has to play you at Quidditch.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Harry, please,''  (<font color='red'><b>Hermione/HERMIONE</b></font>)</div>said Hermione, her (<font color='blue'><b>Hermione</b></font>) eyes now shining with tears, <div class="bookquote">``Please
be sensible. Black did a terrible, terrible thing, but d-don't Put
Yourself in danger, it's what Black wants... Oh, Harry, you'd be
Playing right into Black's hands if you went looking for him (<font color='blue'><b>Black</b></font>). Your mum
and dad wouldn't want you to get hurt, would they? They'd never want you
to go looking for Black!''

 (<font color='red'><b>Hermione/HERMIONE</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I'll never know what they'd have wanted, because thanks to Black, I've
never spoken to them,''  (<font color='red'><b>Harry/Potter/Harry Potter</b></font>)</div>said Harry shortly.

<p/>There was a silence in which Crookshanks stretched luxuriously flexing
his (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) claws. Ron's pocket quivered.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Look,''  (<font color='red'><b>Ron</b></font>)</div>said Ron, obviously casting around for a change of subject,
<div class="bookquote">``it's the holidays! It's nearly Christmas! Let's -- let's go down and
see Hagrid. We haven't visited him (<font color='blue'><b>Black</b></font>) for ages!''

 (<font color='red'><b>Ron</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``No!''  (<font color='red'><b>Hermione/HERMIONE</b></font>)</div>said Hermione quickly. <div class="bookquote">``Harry isn't supposed to leave the castle,
Ron --''

 (<font color='red'><b>Harry/Potter/Harry Potter</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Yeah, let's go,''  (<font color='red'><b>Harry/Potter/Harry Potter</b></font>)</div>said Harry, sitting up, <div class="bookquote">``and I can ask him (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) how come he (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>)
never mentioned Black when he (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) told me all about my parents!''

 (<font color='red'><b>Harry/Potter/Harry Potter</b></font>)</div><p/>Further discussion of Sirius Black plainly wasn't what Ron had had in
mind.

<p/>``Or we could have a game of chess, he (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) said hastily, <div class="bookquote">``or Gobstones. Percy
left a set --''

 (<font color='red'><b>Harry/Potter/Harry Potter</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``No, let's visit Hagrid,''  (<font color='red'><b>Percy/Weasley/Percy Weasley</b></font>)</div>said Harry firmly.

<p/>So they got their cloaks from their dormitories and set off through the
portrait hole -LRB-<div class="bookquote">``Stand and fight, you yellow-bellied mongrels!'' (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>-RRB-, down
through the empty castle and out through the oak front doors.

<p/>They made their way slowly down the lawn, making a shallow trench in the
glittering, powdery snow, their socks and the hems of their cloaks
soaked and freezing. The Forbidden Forest looked as though it had been
enchanted, each tree smattered with silver, and Hagrid's cabin looked
like an iced cake.

<p/>Ron knocked, but there was no answer.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``He (<font color='blue'><b>Percy</b></font>)'s not out, is he (<font color='blue'><b>Percy</b></font>)?''  (<font color='red'><b>Hermione/HERMIONE</b></font>)</div>said Hermione, who was shivering under her (<font color='blue'><b>Hermione</b></font>) cloak.

<p/>Ron had his (<font color='blue'><b>Ron</b></font>) ear to the door.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``There's a weird noise,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Ron</b></font>) said. <div class="bookquote">``Listen -- is that Fang?''

 (<font color='red'><b>Harry/Potter/Harry Potter</b></font>)</div><p/>Harry and Hermione put their ears to the door too. From inside the cabin
came a series of low, throbbing moans.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Think we'd better go and get someone?''  (<font color='red'><b>Ron</b></font>)</div>said Ron nervously.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Hagrid!''  (<font color='red'><b>Harry/Potter/Harry Potter</b></font>)</div>called Harry, thumping the door. ``Hagrid, are you in there.

<p/>There was a sound of heavy footsteps, then the door creaked open. Hagrid
stood there with his (<font color='blue'><b>Fang</b></font>) eyes red and swollen, tears splashing down the
front of his (<font color='blue'><b>Fang</b></font>) leather vest.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``YWve heard?''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) bellowed, and he (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) flung himself onto Harry's neck.

<p/>Hagrid being at least twice the size of a normal man, this was no
laughing matter. Harry, about to collapse under Hagrid's weight, was
rescued by Ron and Hermione, who each seized Hagrid under an arm and
heaved him (<font color='blue'><b>Ron</b></font>) back into the cabin. Hagrid allowed himself to be steered
into a chair and slumped over the table, sobbing uncontrollably, his (<font color='blue'><b>Ron</b></font>)
face glazed with tears that dripped down into his (<font color='blue'><b>Ron</b></font>) tangled beard.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Hagrid, what is it?''  (<font color='red'><b>Hermione/HERMIONE</b></font>)</div>said Hermione, aghast.

<p/>Harry spotted an official-looking letter lying open on the table.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``What's this, Hagrid?''

 (<font color='red'><b>Hagrid</b></font>)</div><p/>Hagrid's sobs redoubled, but he (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) shoved the letter toward Harry, who
Picked it up and read aloud:

<p/>Dear Mr. Hagrid,

<p/>Further to our inquiry into the attack by a hippogriff on a student in
your class, we have accepted the assurances of Professor Dumbledore that
you bear no responsibility for the regrettable incident.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Well, that's okay then, Hagrid!''  (<font color='red'><b>Ron</b></font>)</div>said Ron, clapping Hagrid oil the
shoulder. But Hagrid continued to sob, and waved one of his (<font color='blue'><b>Ron</b></font>) gigantic
hands, inviting Harry to read on.

<p/>However, we must register our concern about the hippogriff in question.
We have decided to uphold the official complaint of Mr. Lucius Malfoy,
and this matter will therefore be taken to the Committee for the
Disposal of Dangerous Creatures. The hearing will take place on April
20th, and we ask you to present yourself and your hippogriff at the
Committee's offices in London on that date. In the meantime, the
hippogriff should be kept tethered and isolated. Yours in fellowship...

<p/>There followed a list of the school governors.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Oh,''  (<font color='red'><b>Ron</b></font>)</div>said Ron. ``But you said Buckbeak isn't a bad hippogriff, Hagrid. I
bet he (<font color='blue'><b>Fang</b></font>)'ll get off

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Yeh don' know them gargoyles at the Committee fer the Disposal o'
Dangerous Creatures!''  (<font color='red'><b>Hagrid</b></font>)</div>choked Hagrid, wiping his (<font color='blue'><b>Ron</b></font>) eyes on his (<font color='blue'><b>Ron</b></font>) sleeve.
<div class="bookquote">``They've got it in fer interestin' creatures!''

 (<font color='red'><b>Hagrid</b></font>)</div><p/>A sudden sound from the corner of Hagrid's cabin made Harry, Ron, and
Hermione whip around. Buckbeak the hippogriff was lying in the corner,
chomping on something that was oozing blood all over the floor.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``I couldn' leave him (<font color='blue'><b>Fang</b></font>) tied up out there in the snow!''  (<font color='red'><b>Hagrid</b></font>)</div>choked Hagrid. <div class="bookquote">``All
on his (<font color='blue'><b>Fang</b></font>) own! At Christmas.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Harry/Potter/Harry Potter</b></font>)</div><p/>Harry, Ron, and Hermione looked at one another. They had never seen eye
to eye with Hagrid about what he (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) called <div class="bookquote">``interesting creatures''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>and
other people called <div class="bookquote">``terrifying monsters.''  (<font color='red'><b>people</b></font>)</div>Or' the other hand, there
didn't seem to be any particular harm in Buckbeak. In fact, by Hagrid's
usual standards, he (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) was positively cute.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``You'll have to put up a good strong defense, Hagrid,''  (<font color='red'><b>Hermione/HERMIONE</b></font>)</div>said Hermione,
sitting down and laying a hand on Hagrid's massive forearm. <div class="bookquote">``I'm sure
you can prove Buckbeak is safe.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Won't make no diff`rence!''  (<font color='red'><b>Hagrid</b></font>)</div>sobbed Hagrid. <div class="bookquote">``Them Disposal devils,
they're all in Lucius Malfoy's pocket! Scared o' him (<font color='blue'><b>Malfoy</b></font>)! Ad if I lose the
case, Buckbeak --''

 (<font color='red'><b>Hagrid</b></font>)</div><p/>Hagrid drew his (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) finger swiftly across his (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) throat, then gave a great wail
and lurched forward, his (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) face in his (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) arms.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``What about Dumbledore, Hagrid?''  (<font color='red'><b>Harry/Potter/Harry Potter</b></font>)</div>said Harry.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``He (<font color='blue'><b>Dumbledore</b></font>)'s done more'n enough fer me already,''  (<font color='red'><b>Hagrid</b></font>)</div>groaned Hagrid. <div class="bookquote">``Got enough on
his (<font color='blue'><b>Dumbledore</b></font>) plate what with keepin' them dementors outta the castle, an' Sirius
Black lurkin' around --''

 (<font color='red'><b>Ron</b></font>)</div><p/>Ron and Hermione looked quickly at Harry, as though expecting him (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) to
start berating Hagrid for not telling him (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) the truth about Black. But
Harry couldn't bring himself to do it, not now that he (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) saw Hagrid so
miserable and scared.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Listen, Hagrid,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) said, <div class="bookquote">``you can't give up. Hermione's right, You
just need a good defense. You can call us as witnesses --''

 (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I'm sure I've read about a case of hippogriff-baiting,''  (<font color='red'><b>Hermione/HERMIONE</b></font>)</div>said Hermione
thoughtfully, <div class="bookquote">``where the hippogriff got off I'll look it up for you,
Hagrid, and see exactly what happened.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Hermione/HERMIONE</b></font>)</div><p/>Hagrid howled still more loudly. Harry and Hermione looked at Ron to
help them.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Er -- shall I make a cup of tea?''  (<font color='red'><b>Ron</b></font>)</div>said Ron.

<p/>Harry stared at him (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>).

<p/><div class="bookquote">``It's what my mum does whenever someone's upset,''  (<font color='red'><b>Ron</b></font>)</div>Ron muttered,
shrugging.

<p/>At last, after many more assurances of help, with a steaming mug of tea
in front of him (<font color='blue'><b>Ron</b></font>), Hagrid blew his (<font color='blue'><b>Ron</b></font>) nose on a handkerchief the size of a
tablecloth and said, ``Yer right. I can' afford to go ter pieces. Gotta
pull meself together...

<p/>Fang the boarhound came timidly out from under the table and laid his (<font color='blue'><b>Fang</b></font>)
head on Hagrid's knee.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``I've not bin meself lately,''  (<font color='red'><b>Hagrid</b></font>)</div>said Hagrid, stroking Fang with one hand
and mopping his (<font color='blue'><b>Fang</b></font>) face with the other. <div class="bookquote">``Worried abou' Buckbeak, an' no one
likin' me classes --''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``We do like them!''  (<font color='red'><b>Hermione/HERMIONE</b></font>)</div>lied Hermione at once.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Yeah, they're great!''  (<font color='red'><b>Ron</b></font>)</div>said Ron, crossing his (<font color='blue'><b>Ron</b></font>) fingers under the table.
<div class="bookquote">``Er -- how are the flobberworms?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Dead,''  (<font color='red'><b>Hagrid</b></font>)</div>said Hagrid gloomily. <div class="bookquote">``Too much lettuce.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Oh no!''  (<font color='red'><b>Ron</b></font>)</div>said Ron, his (<font color='blue'><b>Ron</b></font>) lip twitching.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``An' them dementors make me feel ruddy terrible an' all,''  (<font color='red'><b>Hagrid</b></font>)</div>said Hagrid,
with a sudden shudder. ``Gotta walk past 'em ev'ry time I want a drink in
the Three Broomsticks. <div class="bookquote">``S like bein' back in Azkaban --''

 (<font color='red'><b>He</b></font>)</div><p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Ron</b></font>) fell silent, gulping his (<font color='blue'><b>Ron</b></font>) tea. Harry, Ron, and Hermione watched him (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>)
breathlessly. They had never heard Hagrid talk about his (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) brief spell in
Azkaban before. After a pause, Hermione said timidly, <div class="bookquote">``Is it awful in
there, Hagrid?''

 (<font color='red'><b>Hermione/HERMIONE</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Yeh've no idea,''  (<font color='red'><b>Hagrid</b></font>)</div>said Hagrid quietly. <div class="bookquote">``Never bin anywhere like it.
Thought I was goin' mad. Kep' goin' over horrible stuff in me mind...
the day I got expelled from Hogwarts... day me dad died... day I had ter
let Norbert go...''

 (<font color='red'><b>Norbert</b></font>)</div><p/>His (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) eyes filled with tears. Norbert was the baby dragon Hagrid had once
won in a game of cards.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Yeh can' really remember who yeh are after a while. An' yeh can' really
see the point o' livin' at all. I used ter hope I'd jus' die in me
sleep. When they let me out, it was like bein' born again, ev'rythin' I
came floodin' back, it was the bes' feelin' in the world. Mind, the
dementors weren't keen on lettin' me go.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``But you were innocent!''  (<font color='red'><b>Hermione/HERMIONE</b></font>)</div>said Hermione.

<p/>Hagrid snorted.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Think that matters to them? They don' care. Long as they've got a
couple o' hundred humans stuck there with 'em, so they can leech all the
happiness out of 'em, they don' give a damn who's guilty an' who's not.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Hagrid</b></font>)</div><p/>Hagrid went quiet for a moment, staring into his (<font color='blue'><b>Norbert</b></font>) tea. Then he (<font color='blue'><b>Norbert</b></font>) said
quietly, <div class="bookquote">``Thought o' jus' letting Buckbeak go... tryin' ter make him (<font color='blue'><b>Long</b></font>) fly
away... but how d'yeh explain ter a hippogriff it's gotta go inter
hidin'? An' -an' I'm scared o' breakin' the law...''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>He (<font color='blue'><b>Norbert</b></font>) looked up at
them, tears leaking down his (<font color='blue'><b>Norbert</b></font>) face again. <div class="bookquote">``I don' ever want ter go back
ter Azkaban.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Hagrid</b></font>)</div><p/>The trip to Hagrid's, though far from fun, had nevertheless had the
effect Ron and Hermione had hoped. Though Harry had by no means
forgotten about Black, he (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) couldn't brood constantly on revenge if he (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>)
wanted to help Hagrid win his (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) case against the Committee for the
Disposal of Dangerous Creatures. He (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>), Ron, and Hermione went to the
library the next day and returned to the empty common room laden with
books that might help prepare a defense for Buckbeak. The three of them
sat in front of the roaring fire, slowly turning the pages of dusty
volumes about famous cases If marauding beasts, speaking occasionally
when they ran across something relevant.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Here's something... there was a case in 1722... but the hippogriff was
convicted -- ugh, look what they did to it, that's disgusting --''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``This might help, look -- a manticore savaged someone in 1296, and they
let the manticore off -- oh -- no, that was only because everyone was
too scared to go near it.''

 (<font color='red'><b>the students</b></font>)</div><p/>Meanwhile, in the rest of the castle, the usual magnificent Christmas
decorations had been put up, despite the fact that hardly any of the
students remained to enjoy them. Thick streamers of holly and mistletoe
were strung along the corridors, mysterious lights shone from inside
every suit of armor, and the Great Hall was filled with its usual twelve
Christmas trees, glittering with golden stars. A powerful and delicious
smell of cooking pervaded the corridors, and by Christmas Eve, it had
grown so strong that even Scabbers poked his (<font color='blue'><b>Great</b></font>) nose out of the shelter of
Ron's pocket to sniff hopefully at the air.

<p/>On Christmas morning, Harry was woken by Ron throwing his (<font color='blue'><b>Ron</b></font>) pillow at him (<font color='blue'><b>Ron</b></font>).

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Oy! Presents!''

 (<font color='red'><b>Harry/Potter/Harry Potter</b></font>)</div><p/>Harry reached for his (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) glasses and put them on, squinting through the
semi-darkness to the foot of his (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) bed, where a small heap of parcels had
appeared. Ron was already ripping the paper off his (<font color='blue'><b>Ron</b></font>) own presents.

<p/>``Another sweater from Mum... maroon again... see if you've got one.

<p/>Harry had. Mrs. Weasley had sent him (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) a scarlet sweater with the
Gryffindor lion knitted on the front, also a dozen home-baked mince
pies, some Christmas cake, and a box of nut brittle. As he (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) moved all
these things aside, he (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) saw a long, thin package lying underneath.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``What's that?''  (<font color='red'><b>Ron</b></font>)</div>said Ron, looking over, a freshly unwrapped pair of
maroon socks in his (<font color='blue'><b>Ron</b></font>) hand.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Dunno...''

 (<font color='red'><b>Harry/Potter/Harry Potter</b></font>)</div><p/>Harry ripped the parcel open and gasped as a magnificent, gleaming
broomstick rolled out onto his (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) bedspread. Ron dropped his (<font color='blue'><b>Ron</b></font>) socks and
jumped off his (<font color='blue'><b>Ron</b></font>) bed for a closer look.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``I don't believe it,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Ron</b></font>) said hoarsely.

<p/>It was a Firebolt, identical to the dream broom Harry had gone to see
every day in Diagon Alley. Its handle glittered as he (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) picked it up. He (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>)
could feel it vibrating and let go; it hung in midair, unsupported, at
exactly the right height for him (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) to mount it. His (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) eyes moved from the
golden registration number at the top of the handle, right down to the
perfectly smooth, streamlined birch twigs that made up the tail.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Who sent it to you?''  (<font color='red'><b>Ron</b></font>)</div>said Ron in a hushed voice.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Look and see if there's a card,''  (<font color='red'><b>Harry/Potter/Harry Potter</b></font>)</div>said Harry.

<p/>Ron ripped apart the Firebolt's wrappings.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Nothing! Blimey, who'd spend that much on you?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Well,''  (<font color='red'><b>Harry/Potter/Harry Potter</b></font>)</div>said Harry, feeling stunned, <div class="bookquote">``I'm betting it wasn't the
Dursleys.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Harry/Potter/Harry Potter</b></font>)</div><p/>I bet it was Dumbledore,'' said Ron, now walking around and around the
Firebolt, taking in every glorious inch. <div class="bookquote">``He (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) sent you the Invisibility
Cloak anonymously...''

 (<font color='red'><b>Harry/Potter/Harry Potter</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``That was my dad's, though,''  (<font color='red'><b>He</b></font>)</div>said Harry. <div class="bookquote">``Dumbledore was just Passing it
on to me. He (<font color='blue'><b>Dumbledore</b></font>) wouldn't spend hundreds of Galleons on me. He (<font color='blue'><b>Dumbledore</b></font>) can't go
giving students stuff like this --''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``That's why he (<font color='blue'><b>Dumbledore</b></font>) wouldn't say it was from him (<font color='blue'><b>Dumbledore</b></font>)!''  (<font color='red'><b>Ron</b></font>)</div>said Ron. <div class="bookquote">``In case some
git like Malfoy said it was favoritism. Hey, Harry''  (<font color='red'><b>Ron</b></font>)</div>-- Ron gave a great
whoop of laughter -- <div class="bookquote">``Malfoy! Wait till he (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) sees you on this! He (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>)'ll be
sick as a pig! This is an international standard broom, this is!''

 (<font color='red'><b>Ron</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I can't believe this,''  (<font color='red'><b>Harry/Potter/Harry Potter</b></font>)</div>Harry muttered, running a hand along the
Firebolt, while Ron sank onto Harry's bed, laughing his (<font color='blue'><b>Ron</b></font>) head off at the
thought of Malfoy. <div class="bookquote">``Who -?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I know,''  (<font color='red'><b>Ron</b></font>)</div>said Ron, controlling himself, <div class="bookquote">``I know who it could've been --
Lupin!''

 (<font color='red'><b>Ron</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``What?''  (<font color='red'><b>Harry/Potter/Harry Potter</b></font>)</div>said Harry, now starting to laugh himself <div class="bookquote">``Lupin? Listen, if he (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>)
had this much gold, he (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>)'d be able to buy himself some new robes.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Harry/Potter/Harry Potter</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Yeah, but he (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) likes you,''  (<font color='red'><b>Ron</b></font>)</div>said Ron. <div class="bookquote">``And he (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) was away when your Nimbus
got smashed, and he (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) might've heard about it and decided to visit Diagon
Alley and get this for you --''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``What d'you mean, he (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) was away?''  (<font color='red'><b>Harry/Potter/Harry Potter</b></font>)</div>said Harry. <div class="bookquote">``He (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) was ill when I was
playing in that match.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Well, he (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) wasn't in the hospital wing,''  (<font color='red'><b>Ron</b></font>)</div>said Ron. <div class="bookquote">``I was there, cleaning
out the bedpans on that detention from Snape, remember?''

 (<font color='red'><b>Harry</b></font>)</div><p/>Harry frowned at Ron.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``I can't see Lupin affording something like this.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``What're you two laughing about?''

 (<font color='red'><b>Hermione/HERMIONE</b></font>)</div><p/>Hermione had just come in, wearing her (<font color='blue'><b>Hermione</b></font>) dressing gown and carrying
Crookshanks, who was looking very grumpy, with a string of tinsel tied
around his (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) neck.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Don't bring him (<font color='blue'><b>Snape</b></font>) in here!''  (<font color='red'><b>Ron</b></font>)</div>said Ron, hurriedly snatching Scabbers from
the depths of his (<font color='blue'><b>Ron</b></font>) bed and stowing him (<font color='blue'><b>Ron</b></font>) in his (<font color='blue'><b>Ron</b></font>) pajama pocket.

<p/>But Hermione wasn't listening. She (<font color='blue'><b>Hermione</b></font>) dropped Crookshanks onto Seamus's
empty bed and stared, open-mouthed, at the Firebolt.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Oh, Harry! Who sent you that?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``No idea,''  (<font color='red'><b>Harry/Potter/Harry Potter</b></font>)</div>said Harry. <div class="bookquote">``There wasn't a card or anything with it.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Hermione/HERMIONE</b></font>)</div><p/>To his (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) great surprise, Hermione did not appear either excited or
intrigued by the news. On the contrary, her (<font color='blue'><b>Hermione</b></font>) face fell, and she (<font color='blue'><b>Hermione</b></font>) bit her (<font color='blue'><b>Hermione</b></font>)
lip.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``What's the matter with you?''  (<font color='red'><b>Ron</b></font>)</div>said Ron.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``I don't know,''  (<font color='red'><b>Hermione/HERMIONE</b></font>)</div>said Hermione slowly, <div class="bookquote">``but it's a bit odd, isn't it? I
mean, this is supposed to be quite a good broom, isn't it?''

 (<font color='red'><b>Hermione/HERMIONE</b></font>)</div><p/>Ron sighed exasperatedly.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``It's the best broom there is, Hermione,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Ron</b></font>) said.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``So it must've been really expensive...''

 (<font color='red'><b>Ron</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Probably cost more than all the Slytherins' brooms put together,''  (<font color='red'><b>Ron</b></font>)</div>said
Ron happily.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Well... who'd send Harry something as expensive as that, and not even
tell him (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) they'd sent it?''  (<font color='red'><b>Hermione/HERMIONE</b></font>)</div>said Hermione.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Who cares?''  (<font color='red'><b>Ron</b></font>)</div>said Ron impatiently. <div class="bookquote">``Listen, Harry, can I have a go on
it? Can I?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I don't think anyone should ride that broom just yet!''  (<font color='red'><b>Hermione/HERMIONE</b></font>)</div>said Hermione
shrilly.

<p/>Harry and Ron looked at her (<font color='blue'><b>Hermione</b></font>).

<p/><div class="bookquote">``What d'you think Harry's going to do with it -- sweep the floor?''  (<font color='red'><b>Ron</b></font>)</div>said
Ron.

<p/>But before Hermione could answer, Crookshanks sprang from Seamus's bed,
right at Ron's chest.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``GET -- HIM -- OUT -- OF -- HERE!''  (<font color='red'><b>Ron</b></font>)</div>Ron bellowed as Crookshanks's claws
ripped his (<font color='blue'><b>Ron</b></font>) pajamas and Scabbers attempted a wild escape over his (<font color='blue'><b>Ron</b></font>)
shoulder. Ron seized Scabbers by the tail and aimed a misjudged kick at
Crookshanks that hit the trunk at the end of Harry's bed, knocking it
over and causing Ron to hop up and down, howling with pain.

<p/>Crookshanks's fur suddenly stood on end. A shrill, tint,, whistling was
filling the room. The Pocket Sneakoscope had become dislodged from Uncle
Vernon's old socks and was whirling and gleaming on the floor.

<p/>I forgot about that!'' Harry said, bending down and picking up the
Sneakoscope. I never wear those socks if I can help it...

<p/>The Sneakoscope whirled and whistled in his (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) palm. Crookshanks was
hissing and spitting at it.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``You'd better take that cat out of here, Hermione,''  (<font color='red'><b>Ron</b></font>)</div>said Ron furiously,
sitting on Harry's bed nursing his (<font color='blue'><b>Ron</b></font>) toe. <div class="bookquote">``Can't you shut that thing up?''
 (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Ron</b></font>) added to Harry as Hermione strode out of the room, Crookshanks's
yellow eyes still fixed maliciously on Ron.

<p/>Harry stuffed the Sneakoscope back inside the socks and threw it back
into his (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) trunk. All that could be heard now were Ron's stifled moans of
pain and rage. Scabbers was huddled in Ron's hands. It had been a while
since Harry had seen him (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) out of Ron's pocket, and he (<font color='blue'><b>Ron</b></font>) was unpleasantly
surprised to see that Scabbers, once so fat, was now very skinny;
patches of fur seemed to have fallen out too

<p/><div class="bookquote">``He (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>)'s not looking too good, is he (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>)?''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>Harry said.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``It's stress!''  (<font color='red'><b>Ron</b></font>)</div>said Ron. <div class="bookquote">``He (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>)'d be fine if that big stupid furball left
him (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) alone!''

 (<font color='red'><b>Harry/Potter/Harry Potter</b></font>)</div><p/>But Harry, remembering what the woman at the Magical Menagerie had said
about rats living only three years, couldn't help feeling that unless
Scabbers had powers he (<font color='blue'><b>Ron</b></font>) had never revealed, he (<font color='blue'><b>Ron</b></font>) was reaching the end of
his (<font color='blue'><b>Ron</b></font>) life. And despite Ron's frequent conplaints that Scabbers was both
boring and useless, he (<font color='blue'><b>Ron</b></font>) was sure Ron would be very miserable if Scabbers
died.

<p/>Christmas spirit was definitely thin on the ground in the Gryffindor
common room that morning. Hermione had shut Crookshanks in her (<font color='blue'><b>Hermione</b></font>)
dormitory, but was furious with Ron for trying to kick him (<font color='blue'><b>Ron</b></font>); Ron was
still fuming about Crookshanks's fresh attempt to eat Scabbers. Harry
gave up trying to make them talk to each other and devoted himself to
examining the Firebolt, which he (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) had brought down to the common room
with him (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>). For some reason this seemed to annoy Hermione as well; she (<font color='blue'><b>Hermione</b></font>)
didn't say anything, but she (<font color='blue'><b>Hermione</b></font>) kept looking darkly at the broom as though
it too had been criticizing her (<font color='blue'><b>Hermione</b></font>) cat.

<p/>At lunchtime they went down to the Great Hall, to find that the House
tables had been moved against the walls again, and that a single table,
set for twelve, stood in the middle of the room. Professors Dumbledore,
McGonagall, Snape, Sprout, and Flitwick were there, along with Filch,
the caretaker, who had taken off his (<font color='blue'><b>caretaker</b></font>) usual brown coat and was wearing a
very old and rather moldy- looking tailcoat. There were only three other
students, two extremely nervous-looking first years and a sullen-faced
Slytherin fifth year.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Merry Christmas!''  (<font color='red'><b>Dumbledore/Albus Dumbledore</b></font>)</div>said Dumbledore as Harry, Ron, and Hermione
approached the table. <div class="bookquote">``As there are so few of us, it seemed foolish to
use the House tables... Sit down, sit down!''

 (<font color='red'><b>Harry/Potter/Harry Potter</b></font>)</div><p/>Harry, Ron, and Hermione sat down side by side at the end of the table.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Crackers!''  (<font color='red'><b>Dumbledore/Albus Dumbledore</b></font>)</div>said Dumbledore enthusiastically, offering the end of a
large silver noisemaker to Snape, who took it reluctantly and tugged.
With a bang like a gunshot, the cracker flew apart to reveal a large,
pointed witchs hat topped with a stuffed vulture.

<p/>Harry, remembering the boggart, caught Ron's eye and they both grinned;
Snape's mouth thinned and he (<font color='blue'><b>Ron</b></font>) pushed the hat toward Dumbledore, who
swapped it for his (<font color='blue'><b>Dumbledore</b></font>) wizard's hat at once.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Dig in!''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Dumbledore</b></font>) advised the table, beaming around.

<p/>As Harry was helping himself to roast potatoes, the doors of the Great
Hall opened again. It was Professor Trelawney, gliding toward them as
though on wheels. She (<font color='blue'><b>Ron</b></font>) had put on a green sequined dress in honor of the
occasion, making her (<font color='blue'><b>Ron</b></font>) look more than ever like a glittering, oversized
dragonfly.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Sibyll, this is a pleasant surprise!''  (<font color='red'><b>Dumbledore/Albus Dumbledore</b></font>)</div>said Dumbledore, standing up.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``I have been crystal gazing, Headmaster,''  (<font color='red'><b>Professor</b></font>)</div>said Professor Trelawney in
her (<font color='blue'><b>Ron</b></font>) mistiest, most faraway voice, <div class="bookquote">``and to my astonishment, I saw myself
abandoning my solitary luncheon and coming to join you. Who am I to
refuse the promptings of fate? I at once hastened from my tower, and I
do beg you to forgive my lateness...''

 (<font color='red'><b>Trelawney/Sibyll/Sibyll Trelawney</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Certainly, certainly,''  (<font color='red'><b>Dumbledore/Albus Dumbledore</b></font>)</div>said Dumbledore, his (<font color='blue'><b>Dumbledore</b></font>) eyes twinkling. <div class="bookquote">``Let me
draw you up a chair --''

 (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div><p/>And he (<font color='blue'><b>Dumbledore</b></font>) did indeed draw a chair in midair with his (<font color='blue'><b>Dumbledore</b></font>) wand, which revolved
for a few seconds before falling with a thud between Professors Snape
and McGonagall. Professor Trelawney, however, did not sit down; her (<font color='blue'><b>Ron</b></font>)
enormous eyes had been roving around the table, and she (<font color='blue'><b>Ron</b></font>) suddenly uttered
a kind of soft scream.

<p/>I dare not, Headmaster! If I join the table, we shall be thirteen!
Nothing could be more unlucky! Never forget that when thirteen dine
together, the first to rise will be the first to die!''

<p/><div class="bookquote">``We'll risk it, Sibyll,''  (<font color='red'><b>Professor</b></font>)</div>said Professor McGonagall inpatiendy. <div class="bookquote">``Do sit
down, the turkey's getting stone cold.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Professor</b></font>)</div><p/>Professor Trelawney hesitated, then lowered herself into the empty
chair, eyes shut and mouth clenched tight, as though expecting a
thunderbolt to hit the table. Professor McGonagall poked a large spoon
into the nearest tureen.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Tripe, Sibyll?''

 (<font color='red'><b>Professor</b></font>)</div><p/>Professor Trelawney ignored her (<font color='blue'><b>Ron</b></font>). Eyes open again, she (<font color='blue'><b>Ron</b></font>) looked around once
more and said, <div class="bookquote">``But where is dear Professor Lupin?''

 (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I'm afraid the poor fellow is ill again,''  (<font color='red'><b>Dumbledore/Albus Dumbledore</b></font>)</div>said Dumbledore, indicating
that everybody should start serving themselves. <div class="bookquote">``Most unfortunate that
it should happen on Christmas Day.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``But surely you already knew that, Sibyll?''  (<font color='red'><b>Professor</b></font>)</div>said Professor McGonagall,
her (<font color='blue'><b>Ron</b></font>) eyebrows raised.

<p/>Professor Trelawney gave Professor McGonagall a very cold look.

<p/>``Certainly I knew, Minerva, 11 she (<font color='blue'><b>Minerva</b></font>) said quietly. ``But one does not
parade the fact that one is All- Knowing. I frequently act as though I
am not possessed of the Inner Eye, so as not to make others nervous.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``That explains a great deal,''  (<font color='red'><b>Professor</b></font>)</div>said Professor McGonagall tartly.

<p/>Professor Trelawney's voice suddenly became a good deal less misty.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``If you must know, Minerva, I have seen that poor Professor Lupin will
not be with us for very long. He (<font color='blue'><b>Professor</b></font>) seems aware, himself, that his (<font color='blue'><b>Professor</b></font>) time is
short. He (<font color='blue'><b>Professor</b></font>) positively fled when I offered to crystal gaze for him (<font color='blue'><b>Professor</b></font>) --''

 (<font color='red'><b>Professor</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Imagine that,''  (<font color='red'><b>Professor</b></font>)</div>said Professor McGonagall dryly.

<p/>I doubt,'' said Dumbledore, in a cheerful but slightly raised voice,
which put an end to Professor McGonagall and Professor Trelawney's
conversation, <div class="bookquote">``that Professor Lupin is in any immediate danger. Severus,
you've made the potion for him (<font color='blue'><b>Professor</b></font>) again?''

 (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Yes, Headmaster,''  (<font color='red'><b>Snape/Severus/Severus Snape</b></font>)</div>said Snape. <div class="bookquote">``W -- what?''  (<font color='red'><b>Harry/Potter/Harry Potter</b></font>)</div>said Harry, scrambling to
his (<font color='blue'><b>Professor</b></font>) feet. <div class="bookquote">``Why?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``It will need to be checked for jinxes,''  (<font color='red'><b>Professor</b></font>)</div>said Professor McGonagall. <div class="bookquote">``Of
course, I'm no expert, but I daresay Madam Hooch and Professor Flitwick
will strip it down --''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Strip it down?''  (<font color='red'><b>Ron</b></font>)</div>repeated Ron, as though Professor McGonagall was mad.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``It shouldn't take more than a few weeks,''  (<font color='red'><b>Professor</b></font>)</div>said Professor McGonagall.
<div class="bookquote">``You will have it back if we are sure it is jinx-free.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``There's nothing wrong with it!''  (<font color='red'><b>Harry/Potter/Harry Potter</b></font>)</div>said Harry, his (<font color='blue'><b>Professor</b></font>) voice shaking slightly.
<div class="bookquote">``Honestly, Professor --''

 (<font color='red'><b>Professor</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``You can't know that, Potter,''  (<font color='red'><b>Professor</b></font>)</div>said Professor McGonagall, quite kindly,
<div class="bookquote">``not until you've flown it, at any rate, and I'm afraid that is out of
the question until we are certain that it has not been tampered with. I
shall keep you informed.''

 (<font color='red'><b>McGonagall</b></font>)</div><p/>Professor McGonagall turned on her (<font color='blue'><b>Trelawney</b></font>) heel and carried the Firebolt out of
the portrait hole, which closed behind her (<font color='blue'><b>Trelawney</b></font>). Harry stood staring after
her (<font color='blue'><b>Trelawney</b></font>), the tin of High-Finish Polish still clutched in his (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) hands. Ron,
however, rounded on Hermione.

<p/>``What did you go running to McGonagall for?

<p/>Hermione threw her (<font color='blue'><b>Hermione</b></font>) book aside. She (<font color='blue'><b>Hermione</b></font>) was still pink in the face, but stood
up and faced Ron defiantly.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Because I thought -- and Professor McGonagall agrees with me -- that
that broom was probably sent to Harry by Sirius Black!''

 (<font color='red'><b>Harry/Potter/Harry Potter</b></font>)</div><p/>CHAPTER TWELVE

<p/>THE PATRONUS

<p/>Harry knew that Hermione had meant well, but that didn't stop him (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) from
being angry with her (<font color='blue'><b>Hermione</b></font>). He (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) had been the owner of the best broom in the
world for a few short hours, and now, because of her (<font color='blue'><b>Hermione</b></font>) interference, he (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>)
didn't know whether he (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) would ever see it again. He (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) was positive that
there was nothing wrong with the Firebolt now, but what sort of state
would it be in once it had been subjected to all sorts of anti-jinx
tests?

<p/>Ron was furious with Hermione too. As far as he (<font color='blue'><b>Ron</b></font>) was concerned, the
stripping-down of a brand- new Firebolt was nothing less than criminal
damage. Hermione, who remained convinced that she (<font color='blue'><b>Hermione</b></font>) had acted for the
best, started avoiding the common room. Harry and Ron supposed she (<font color='blue'><b>Hermione</b></font>) had
taken refuge in the library and didn't try to persuade her (<font color='blue'><b>Hermione</b></font>) to come back.
All in all, they were glad when the rest of the school returned shortly
after New Year, and Gryffindor Tower became crowded and noisy again.
Wood sought Harry out on the night before term started.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Had a good Christmas?''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) said, and then, without waiting for an
answer, he (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) sat down, lowered his (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) voice, and said, <div class="bookquote">``I've been, doing some
thinking over Christmas, Harry. After last match, you know. If the
dementors come to the next one... I mean... we can't afford you to --
well --''

 (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div><p/>Wood broke off, looking awkward.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``I'm working on it,''  (<font color='red'><b>Harry/Potter/Harry Potter</b></font>)</div>said Harry quickly. <div class="bookquote">``Professor Lupin said he (<font color='blue'><b>Professor</b></font>)'d
train me to ward off the dementors. We should be starting this week. He (<font color='blue'><b>Professor</b></font>)
said he (<font color='blue'><b>Professor</b></font>)'d have time after Christmas.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Ah,''  (<font color='red'><b>Wood/Oliver/Oliver Wood</b></font>)</div>said Wood, his (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) expression clearing. <div class="bookquote">``Well, in that case -- I
really didn't want to lose you as Seeker, Harry. And have you ordered a
new broom yet?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``No,''  (<font color='red'><b>Harry/Potter/Harry Potter</b></font>)</div>said Harry.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``What! You'd better get a move on, you know -- you can't ride that
Shooting Star against Ravenclaw!''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``He (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) got a Firebolt for Christmas,''  (<font color='red'><b>Ron</b></font>)</div>said Ron.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``A Firebolt? No! Seriously? A -- a real Firebolt?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Don't get excited, Oliver,''  (<font color='red'><b>Harry/Potter/Harry Potter</b></font>)</div>said Harry gloomily. <div class="bookquote">``I haven't got it
anymore. It was confiscated.''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>And he (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) explained all about how the
Firebolt was now being checked for jinxes.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Jinxed? How could it be jinxed?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Sirius Black''  (<font color='red'><b>Harry/Potter/Harry Potter</b></font>)</div>Harry said wearily. <div class="bookquote">``He (<font color='blue'><b>Black</b></font>)'s supposed to be after me. So
McGonagall reckons he (<font color='blue'><b>Black</b></font>) might have sent it.''

 (<font color='red'><b>a murderer</b></font>)</div><p/>Waving aside the information that a famous murderer was after his (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>)
Seeker, Wood said, <div class="bookquote">``But Black couldn't have bought a Firebolt! He (<font color='blue'><b>Black</b></font>)'s on
the run! The whole country's on the lookout for him (<font color='blue'><b>Black</b></font>)! How could he (<font color='blue'><b>Black</b></font>) just
walk into Quality Quidditch Supplies and buy a broomstick?''

 (<font color='red'><b>Wood/Oliver/Oliver Wood</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I know,''  (<font color='red'><b>Harry/Potter/Harry Potter</b></font>)</div>said Harry, <div class="bookquote">``but McGonagall still wants to strip it down --''

 (<font color='red'><b>Harry/Potter/Harry Potter</b></font>)</div><p/>Wood went pale.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``I'll go and talk to her (<font color='blue'><b>Black</b></font>), Harry,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) promised. <div class="bookquote">``I'll make her (<font color='blue'><b>Black</b></font>) see
reason... A Firebolt... a real Firebolt, on our team... She (<font color='blue'><b>Black</b></font>) wants
Gryffindor to win as much as we do... I'll make her (<font color='blue'><b>Black</b></font>) see sense. A
Firebolt...''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/>Classes started again the next day. The last thing anyone felt like
doing was spending two hours on the grounds on a raw January morning,
but Hagrid had provided a bonfire full of salamanders for their
enjoyment, and they spent an unusually good lesson collecting dry wood
and leaves to keep the fire blazing while the flame-loving lizards
scampered up and down the crumbling, white-hot logs. The first
Divination lesson of the new term was much less fun; Professor Trelawney
was now teaching them palmistry, and she (<font color='blue'><b>anyone</b></font>) lost no time in informing Harry
that he (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) had the shortest life line she (<font color='blue'><b>anyone</b></font>) had ever seen.

<p/>It was Defense Against the Dark Arts that Harry was keen to get to;
after his (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) conversation with Wood, he (<font color='blue'><b>Wood</b></font>) wanted to get started on his (<font color='blue'><b>Wood</b></font>)
anti-dementor lessons as soon as possible.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Ah yes,''  (<font color='red'><b>Lupin/R. J. Lupin</b></font>)</div>said Lupin, when Harry reminded him (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) of his (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) promise at the end
of class. <div class="bookquote">``Let me see... how about eight o'clock on Thursday evening?
The History of Magic classroom should be large enough... I'll have to
think carefully about how we're going to do this... We can't bring a
real dementor into the castle to practice on...''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Still looks ill, doesn't he (<font color='blue'><b>we</b></font>)?''  (<font color='red'><b>Ron</b></font>)</div>said Ron as they walked down the
corridor, heading to dinner. <div class="bookquote">``What d'you reckon's the matter with him (<font color='blue'><b>we</b></font>)?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/>There was a loud and impatient <div class="bookquote">``tuh''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>from behind them. It was Hermione,
who had been sitting at the feet of a suit of armor, repacking her (<font color='blue'><b>Hermione</b></font>) bag,
which was so full of books it wouldn't close.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``And what are you tutting at us for?''  (<font color='red'><b>Ron</b></font>)</div>said Ron irritably.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Nothing,''  (<font color='red'><b>Hermione/HERMIONE</b></font>)</div>said Hermione in a lofty voice, heaving her (<font color='blue'><b>Hermione</b></font>) bag back over her (<font color='blue'><b>Hermione</b></font>)
shoulder.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Yes, you were,''  (<font color='red'><b>Ron</b></font>)</div>said Ron. <div class="bookquote">``I said I wonder what's wrong with Lupin, and
you --''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Well, isn't it obvious?''  (<font color='red'><b>Hermione/HERMIONE</b></font>)</div>said Hermione, with a look of maddening
superiority.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``If you don't want to tell us, don't,''  (<font color='red'><b>Ron</b></font>)</div>snapped Ron.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Fine,''  (<font color='red'><b>Hermione/HERMIONE</b></font>)</div>said Hermione haughtily, and she (<font color='blue'><b>Hermione</b></font>) marched off.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``She (<font color='blue'><b>you</b></font>) doesn't know,''  (<font color='red'><b>Ron</b></font>)</div>said Ron, staring resentfully after Hermione. <div class="bookquote">``She (<font color='blue'><b>you</b></font>)'s
just trying to get us to talk to her (<font color='blue'><b>you</b></font>) again.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Harry/Potter/Harry Potter</b></font>)</div><p/>At eight o'clock on Thursday evening, Harry left Gryffindor Tower for
the History of Magic classroom. It was dark and empty when he (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) arrived,
but he (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) lit the lamps with his (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) wand and had waited only five minutes when
Professor Lupin turned up, carrying a large packing case, which he (<font color='blue'><b>Professor</b></font>)
heaved onto Professor Binn's desk.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``What's that?''  (<font color='red'><b>Harry/Potter/Harry Potter</b></font>)</div>said Harry.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Another boggart,''  (<font color='red'><b>Lupin/R. J. Lupin</b></font>)</div>said Lupin, stripping off his (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) cloak. <div class="bookquote">``I've been
combing the castle ever since Tuesday, and very luckily, I found this
one lurking inside Mr. Filch's filing cabinet. It's the nearest we'll
get to a real dementor. The boggart will turn into a dementor when he (<font color='blue'><b>Filch</b></font>)
sees you, so we'll be able to practice on him (<font color='blue'><b>Filch</b></font>). I can store him (<font color='blue'><b>Filch</b></font>) in my
office when we're not using him (<font color='blue'><b>Filch</b></font>); there's a cupboard under my desk he (<font color='blue'><b>Filch</b></font>)'ll
like.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Okay,''  (<font color='red'><b>Harry/Potter/Harry Potter</b></font>)</div>said Harry, trying to sound as though he (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) wasn't apprehensive at
all and merely glad that Lupin had found such a good substitute for a
real dementor.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``So...''  (<font color='red'><b>Professor</b></font>)</div>Professor Lupin had taken out his (<font color='blue'><b>Professor</b></font>) own wand, and indicated that
Harry should do the same. <div class="bookquote">``The spell I am going to try and teach you is
highly advanced magic, Harry -- well beyond ordinary Wizarding Level. It
is called the Patronus Charm.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``How does it work?''  (<font color='red'><b>Harry/Potter/Harry Potter</b></font>)</div>said Harry nervously.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Well, when it works correctly, It conjures up a Patronus,''  (<font color='red'><b>Lupin/R. J. Lupin</b></font>)</div>said Lupin,
<div class="bookquote">``which is a kind of anti- dementor -- a guardian that acts as a shield
between you and the dementor.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Lupin/R. J. Lupin</b></font>)</div><p/>Harry had a sudden vision of himself crouching behind a Hagridsized
figure holding a large club. Professor Lupin continued, <div class="bookquote">``The Patronus is
a kind of positive force, a projection of the very things that the
dementor feeds upon -- hope, happiness, the desire to survive -- but it
cannot feel despair, as real humans can, so the dementors can't hurt it.
But I must warn you, Harry, that the charm might be too advanced for
you. Many qualified wizards have difficulty with it.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Lupin/R. J. Lupin</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``What does a Patronus look like?''  (<font color='red'><b>Harry/Potter/Harry Potter</b></font>)</div>said Harry curiously.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Each one is unique to the wizard who conjures it.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``And how do you conjure it?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``With an incantation, which will work only if you are concentrating,
with all your might, on a single, very happy memory.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Harry/Potter/Harry Potter</b></font>)</div><p/>Harry cast his (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) mind about for a happy memory. Certainly, nothing that
had happened to him (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) at the Dursleys' was going to do. Finally, he (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>)
settled on the moment when he (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) had first ridden a broomstick.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Right,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) said, trying to recall as exactly as possible the wonderful,
soaring sensation of his (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) stomach.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``The incantation is this --''  (<font color='red'><b>Lupin/R. J. Lupin</b></font>)</div>Lupin cleared his (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) throat. <div class="bookquote">``Expecto
patronum!''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Expecto patronum, ''  (<font color='red'><b>Harry/Potter/Harry Potter</b></font>)</div>Harry repeated under his (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) breath, <div class="bookquote">``expecto
patronum.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Harry/Potter/Harry Potter</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Concentrating hard on your happy memory?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Oh -- yeah --''  (<font color='red'><b>Harry/Potter/Harry Potter</b></font>)</div>said Harry, quickly forcing his (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) thoughts back to that
first broom ride. <div class="bookquote">``Expecto patrono -- no, patronum -- sorry -- expecto
patronum, expecto patronum''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/>Something whooshed suddenly out of the end of his (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) wand; it looked like a
wisp of silvery gas.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Did you see that?''  (<font color='red'><b>Harry/Potter/Harry Potter</b></font>)</div>said Harry excitedly. <div class="bookquote">``Something happened!''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Very good,''  (<font color='red'><b>Lupin/R. J. Lupin</b></font>)</div>said Lupin, smiling. <div class="bookquote">``Right, then -- ready to try it on a
dementor?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Yes,''  (<font color='red'><b>Harry/Potter/Harry Potter</b></font>)</div>Harry said, gripping his (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) wand very tightly, and moving into the
middle of the deserted classroom. He (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) tried to keep his (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) mind on flying,
but something else kept intruding... Any second now, he (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) might hear his (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>)
mother again... but he (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) shouldn't think that, or he (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) would hear her (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) again,
and he (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) didn't want to... or did he (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>)?

<p/>Lupin grasped the lid of the packing case and pulled.

<p/>A dementor rose slowly from the box, its hooded face turned toward
Harry, one glistening, scabbed hand gripping its cloak. The lamps around
the classroom flickered and went out. The dementor stepped from the box
and started to sweep silently toward Harry, drawing a deep, rattling
breath. A wave of piercing cold broke over him (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) --

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Expecto patronum!''  (<font color='red'><b>him</b></font>)</div>Harry yelled. <div class="bookquote">``Expecto patronum! Expecto --''

 (<font color='red'><b>Harry/Potter/Harry Potter</b></font>)</div><p/>But the classroom and the dementor were dissolving... Harry was failing
again through thick white fog, and his (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) mother's voice was louder than
ever, echoing inside his (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) head -- <div class="bookquote">``Not Harry! Not Harry! please -- I'll
do anything!''

 (<font color='red'><b>mother</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Stand aside. Stand aside, girl!''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Harry!''

 (<font color='red'><b>Harry/Potter/Harry Potter</b></font>)</div><p/>Harry jerked back to life. He (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) was lying flat on his (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) back on the floor.
The classroom lamps were alight again. He (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) didn't have to ask what had
happened.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Sorry,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) muttered, sitting up and feeling cold sweat trickling down
behind his (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) glasses.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Are you all right?''  (<font color='red'><b>Lupin/R. J. Lupin</b></font>)</div>said Lupin.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Yes...''  (<font color='red'><b>Harry/Potter/Harry Potter</b></font>)</div>Harry pulled himself up on one of the desks and leaned against
it.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Here --''  (<font color='red'><b>Lupin/R. J. Lupin</b></font>)</div>Lupin handed him (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) a Chocolate Frog. <div class="bookquote">``Eat this before we try
again. I didn't expect you to do it your first time; in fact, I would
have been astounded if you had.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``It's getting worse,''  (<font color='red'><b>Harry/Potter/Harry Potter</b></font>)</div>Harry muttered, biting off the Frog's head. ``I
could hear her (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) louder that time -- and him (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) -- Voldemort

<p/>Lupin looked paler than usual. ,

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Harry, if you don't want to continue, I will more than understand --''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I do!''  (<font color='red'><b>Harry/Potter/Harry Potter</b></font>)</div>said Harry fiercely, stuffing the rest of the Chocolate Frog
into his (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) mouth. <div class="bookquote">``I've got to! What if the dementors turn up at our match
against Ravenclaw? I can't afford to fall off again. If we lose this
game we've lost the Quidditch Cup!''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``All right then... ''  (<font color='red'><b>Lupin/R. J. Lupin</b></font>)</div>said Lupin. <div class="bookquote">``You might want to select `other
memory, a happy memory, I mean, to concentrate on... That one doesn't
seem to have been strong enough...''

 (<font color='red'><b>Harry/Potter/Harry Potter</b></font>)</div><p/>Harry thought hard and decided his (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) feelings when Gryffindor had won the
House Championship last year had definitely qualified as very happy. He (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>)
gripped his (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) wand tightly again and took up his (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) position in the middle of
the classroom.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Ready?''  (<font color='red'><b>Lupin/R. J. Lupin</b></font>)</div>said Lupin, gripping the box lid.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Ready,''  (<font color='red'><b>Harry/Potter/Harry Potter</b></font>)</div>said Harry; trying hard to fill his (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) head with happy thoughts
about Gryffindor winning, and not dark thoughts about what was going to
happen when the box opened.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Go!''  (<font color='red'><b>Lupin/R. J. Lupin</b></font>)</div>said Lupin, pulling off the lid. The room went icily cold and dark
once more. The dementor glided forward, drawing its breath; one rotting
hand was extending toward Harry -

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Expecto patronum!''  (<font color='red'><b>Harry/Potter/Harry Potter</b></font>)</div>Harry yelled. <div class="bookquote">``Expecto patronum! Expecto Pat --''

 (<font color='red'><b>White</b></font>)</div><p/>White fog obscured his (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) senses... big, blurred shapes were moving around
him (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>)... then came a new voice, a man's voice, shouting, panicking --

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Lily, take Harry and go! It's him (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>)! Go! Run! I'll hold him (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) off --''

 (<font color='red'><b>a man</b></font>)</div><p/>The sounds of someone stumbling ftom a room -- a door bursting open -- a
cackle of high- pitched laughter --

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Harry! Harry... wake up...''

 (<font color='red'><b>someone</b></font>)</div><p/>Lupin was tapping Harry hard on the face. This time it was a minute
before Harry understood why he (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) was lying on a dusty classroom floor.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``I heard my dad,''  (<font color='red'><b>Harry/Potter/Harry Potter</b></font>)</div>Harry mumbled. <div class="bookquote">``That's the first time I've ever heard
him (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) -- he (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) tried to take on Voldemort himself, to give my mum time to run
for it...''

 (<font color='red'><b>Harry/Potter/Harry Potter</b></font>)</div><p/>Harry suddenly realized that there were tears on his (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) face mingling with
the sweat. He (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) bent his (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) face as low as possible, wiping them off on his (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>)
robes, pretending to do up his (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) shoelace, so that Lupin wouldn't see.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``You heard James?''  (<font color='red'><b>Lupin/R. J. Lupin</b></font>)</div>said Lupin in a strange voice.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Yeah...''  (<font color='red'><b>Harry/Potter/Harry Potter</b></font>)</div>Face dry, Harry looked up. <div class="bookquote">``Why -- you didn't know my dad, did
you?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I -- I did, as a matter of fact,''  (<font color='red'><b>Lupin/R. J. Lupin</b></font>)</div>said Lupin. <div class="bookquote">``We were friends at
Hogwarts. Listen, Harry -- perhaps we should leave it here for tonight.
This charm is ridiculously advanced... I shouln't have suggested
putting you through this...''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``No!''  (<font color='red'><b>Harry/Potter/Harry Potter</b></font>)</div>said Harry. He (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) got up again. <div class="bookquote">``I'll have one more go! I'm not
thinking of happy enough things, that's what it is... Hang on...''

 (<font color='red'><b>He</b></font>)</div><p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) racked his (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) brains. A really, really happy memory... one that he (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) could
turn into a good, strong Patronus...

<p/>The moment when he (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>)'d first found out he (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) was a wizard, and would be
leaving the Dursleys for Hogwarts! If that wasn't a happy memory, he (<font color='blue'><b>Hogwarts</b></font>)
didn't know what was... Concentrating very hard on how he (<font color='blue'><b>Hogwarts</b></font>) had felt when
he (<font color='blue'><b>Hogwarts</b></font>)'d realized he (<font color='blue'><b>Hogwarts</b></font>)'d be leaving Privet Drive, Harry got to his (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) feet and
faced the packing case once more.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Ready?''  (<font color='red'><b>Lupin/R. J. Lupin</b></font>)</div>said Lupin, who looked as though he (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) were doing this against his (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>)
better judgment. <div class="bookquote">``Concentrating hard? All right -- go!''

 (<font color='red'><b>He</b></font>)</div><p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) pulled off the lid of the case for the third time, and the dementor
rose out of it; the room fell cold and dark

<p/><div class="bookquote">``EXPECTO PATRONUM!''  (<font color='red'><b>He</b></font>)</div>Harry bellowed. <div class="bookquote">``EXPECTO PATRONUM! EXPECTO PATRONUM!
''

 (<font color='red'><b>Harry/Potter/Harry Potter</b></font>)</div><p/>The screaming inside Harry's head had started again -- except this time,
it sounded as though it were coming from a badly tuned radio -- softer
and louder and softer again -- and he (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) could still see the dementor -- it
had halted -- and then a huge, silver shadow came bursting out of the
end of Harry's wand, to hover between him (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) and the dementor, and though
Harry's legs felt like water, he (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) was still on his (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) feet -- though for how
much longer, he (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) wasn't sure --

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Riddikulus!''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>roared Lupin, springing forward.

<p/>There was a loud crack, and Harry's cloudy Patronus vanished along with
the dementor; he (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) sank into a chair, feeling as exhausted as if he (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>)'d just
run a mile, and felt his (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) legs shaking. Out of the corner of his (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) eye, he (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>)
saw Professor Lupin forcing the boggart back into the packing case with
his (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) wand; it had turned into a silvery orb again.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Excellent!''  (<font color='red'><b>Lupin/R. J. Lupin</b></font>)</div>Lupin said, striding over to where Harry sat. <div class="bookquote">``Excellent,
Harry! That was definitely a start!''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Can we have another go? Just one more go?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Not now,''  (<font color='red'><b>Lupin/R. J. Lupin</b></font>)</div>said Lupin firmly. <div class="bookquote">``You've had enough for one night. Here --''

 (<font color='red'><b>He</b></font>)</div><p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) handed Harry a large bar of Honeydukes' best chocolate.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Eat the lot, or Madam Pomfrey will be after my blood. Same time next
week?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Okay,''  (<font color='red'><b>Harry/Potter/Harry Potter</b></font>)</div>said Harry. He (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) took a bite of the chocolate and watched Lupin
extinguishing the lamps that had rekindled with the disappearance of the
dementor. A thought had just occurred to him (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>).

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Professor Lupin?''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) said. <div class="bookquote">``If you knew my dad, you must've known
Sirius Black as well.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Lupin/R. J. Lupin</b></font>)</div><p/>Lupin turned very quickly.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``What gives you that idea?''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) said sharply.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Nothing -- I mean, I just knew they were friends at Hogwarts too...''

 (<font color='red'><b>Lupin</b></font>)</div><p/>Lupin's face relaxed.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Yes, I knew him (<font color='blue'><b>Black</b></font>),''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) said shortly. <div class="bookquote">``Or I thought I did. You'd better be
off, Harry, it's getting late.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Harry/Potter/Harry Potter</b></font>)</div><p/>Harry left the classroom, walking along the corridor and around a
corner, then took a detour behind a suit of armor and sank down on its
plinth to finish his (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) chocolate, wishing he (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) hadn't mentioned Black, as
Lupin was obviously not keen on the subject. Then Harry's thoughts
wandered back to his (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) mother and father...

<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) felt drained and strangely empty, even though he (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) was so full of
chocolate. Terrible though it was to hear his (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) parents' last moments
replayed inside his (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) head, these were the only times Harry had heard
their voices since he (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) was a very small child. But he (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>)'d never be able to
produce a proper Patronus if he (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) half wanted to hear his (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) parents
again...

<p/><div class="bookquote">``They're dead,''  (<font color='red'><b>parents</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) told himself sternly. <div class="bookquote">``They're dead and listening to
echoes of them won't bring them back. You'd better get a grip on
yourself if you want that Quidditch Cup.''

 (<font color='red'><b>He</b></font>)</div><p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) stood up, crammed the last bit of chocolate into his (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) mouth, and
headed back to Gryffindor Tower.

<p/>Ravenclaw played Slytherin a week after the start of term. Slytherin
won, though narrowly. According to Wood, this was good news for
Gryffindor, who would take second place if they beat Ravenclaw too. He (<font color='blue'><b>Wood</b></font>)
therefore increased the number of team practices to five a leek. This
meant that with Lupin's anti-dementor classes, which in themselves were
more draining than six Quidditch practices, Harry had just one night a
week to do all his (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) homework. Even so, he (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) was showing the strain nearly
as much as Hermione, whose immense workload finally seemed to be getting
to her (<font color='blue'><b>Hermione</b></font>). Every night, without fail, Hermione was to be seen in a corner
of the common room, several tables spread with books, Arithmancy charts,
rune dictionaries, diagrams of Muggles lifting heavy objects, and file
upon file of extensive notes; she (<font color='blue'><b>Hermione</b></font>) barely spoke to anybody and snapped
when she (<font color='blue'><b>Hermione</b></font>) was interrupted.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``How's she (<font color='blue'><b>Black</b></font>) doing it?''  (<font color='red'><b>Ron</b></font>)</div>Ron muttered to Harry one evening as Harry sat
finishing a nasty essay on Undetectable Poisons for Snape. Harry looked
up. Hermione was barely visible behind a tottering pile of books.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Doing what?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Getting to all her (<font color='blue'><b>Black</b></font>) classes!''  (<font color='red'><b>Ron</b></font>)</div>Ron said. <div class="bookquote">``I heard her (<font color='blue'><b>Black</b></font>) talking to
Professor Vector, that Arithmancy witch, this morning. They were going
on about yesterday's lesson, but Hermione can't 've been there, because
she (<font color='blue'><b>Hermione</b></font>) was with us in Care of Magical Creatures! And Ernie McMillan told me
she (<font color='blue'><b>Hermione</b></font>)'s never missed a Muggle Studies class, but half of them are at the
same time as Divination, and she (<font color='blue'><b>Hermione</b></font>)'s never missed one of them either!''

 (<font color='red'><b>Harry/Potter/Harry Potter</b></font>)</div><p/>Harry didn't have time to fathom the mystery of Hermione's impossible
schedule at the moment; he (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) really needed to get on with Snape's essay.
Two seconds later, however, he (<font color='blue'><b>Snape</b></font>) was interrupted again, this time by Wood.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Bad news, Harry. I've just been to see Professor McGonagall about the
Firebolt. She (<font color='blue'><b>Hermione</b></font>) -- er -- got a bit shirty with me. Told m' I'd got my
priorities wrong. Seemed to think I cared more about winning the Cup
than I do about you staying alive. Just because I told her (<font color='blue'><b>Hermione</b></font>) I didn't care
if it threw you off, as long as you caught the Snitch first.''  (<font color='red'><b>Wood/Oliver/Oliver Wood</b></font>)</div>Wood shook
his (<font color='blue'><b>Wood</b></font>) head in disbelief. ``Honestly, the way she (<font color='blue'><b>Hermione</b></font>) was yelling at me... you'd
think I'd said something terrible... then I asked her (<font color='blue'><b>Hermione</b></font>) how much longer
she (<font color='blue'><b>Hermione</b></font>) was going to keep it. He (<font color='blue'><b>Hermione</b></font>) screwed up his (<font color='blue'><b>Hermione</b></font>) face and imitated Professor
McGonagall's severe voice. <div class="bookquote">``As long as necessary, Wood'... I reckon it's
time you ordered a new broom, Harry. There's an order form at the back
of Which Broomstick... you could get a Nimbus Two Thousand and One, like
Malfoy's got.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I'm not buying anything Malfoy thinks is good,''  (<font color='red'><b>Harry/Potter/Harry Potter</b></font>)</div>said Harry flatly.

<p/>January faded imperceptibly into February, with no change in the
bitterly cold weather. The match against Ravenclaw was drawing nearer
and nearer, but Harry still hadn't ordered a new broom. He (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) was now
asking Professor McGonagall for news of the Firebolt after every
Transfiguration lesson, Ron standing hopefully at his (<font color='blue'><b>Ron</b></font>) shoulder, Hermione
rushing past with her (<font color='blue'><b>Hermione</b></font>) face averted.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``No, Potter, you can't have it back yet,''  (<font color='red'><b>Professor</b></font>)</div>Professor McGonagall told him (<font color='blue'><b>Professor</b></font>)
the twelfth time this happened, before he (<font color='blue'><b>Professor</b></font>)'d even opened his (<font color='blue'><b>Professor</b></font>) mouth.
<div class="bookquote">``We've checked for most of the usual curses, but Professor Flitwick
believes the broom might be carrying a Hurling Hex. I shall tell you
once we've finished checking it. Now, please stop badgering me.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Harry/Potter/Harry Potter</b></font>)</div><p/>To make matters even worse, Harry's anti-dementor lessons were not going
nearly as well as he (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) had hoped. Several sessions on, he (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) was able to
produce an indistinct, silvery shadow every time the boggart-dementor
approached him (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>), but his (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) Patronus was too feeble to drive the dementor
away. All it did was hover, like a semitransparent cloud, draining Harry
of energy as he (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) fought to keep it there. Harry felt angry with himself,
guilty about his (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) secret desire to hear his (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) parents' voices again.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``You're expecting too much of yourself,''  (<font color='red'><b>Professor</b></font>)</div>said Professor Lupin, sternly
in their fourth week of practice. <div class="bookquote">``For a thirteen-year-old wizard, even
an indistinct Patronus is a huge achievement. You aren't passing out
anymore, are you?''

 (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div><p/>I thought a Patronus would -- charge the dementors down or something,''
said Harry dispiritedly. <div class="bookquote">``Make them disappear --''

 (<font color='red'><b>Lupin/R. J. Lupin</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``The true Patronus does do that,''  (<font color='red'><b>Lupin/R. J. Lupin</b></font>)</div>said Lupin. <div class="bookquote">``But you've achieved a
great deal in a very short space of time. If the dementors put in an
appearance at your next Quidditch match, You will be able to keep them
at bay long enough to get back to the ground.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``You said it's harder if there are loads of them,''  (<font color='red'><b>Harry/Potter/Harry Potter</b></font>)</div>said Harry.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``I have complete confidence in you,''  (<font color='red'><b>Lupin/R. J. Lupin</b></font>)</div>said Lupin, smiling. <div class="bookquote">``Here --
you've earned a drink - something from the Three Broomsticks. You won't
have tried it before --''

 (<font color='red'><b>He</b></font>)</div><p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) pulled two bottles out of his (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) briefcase.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Butterbeer!''  (<font color='red'><b>Harry/Potter/Harry Potter</b></font>)</div>said Harry, without thinking. <div class="bookquote">``Yeah, I like that stuff!''

 (<font color='red'><b>Lupin</b></font>)</div><p/>Lupin raised an eyebrow.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Oh -Ron and Hermione brought me some back from Hogsmeade,''  (<font color='red'><b>Harry/Potter/Harry Potter</b></font>)</div>Harry lied
quickly.

<p/>I see,'' said Lupin, though he (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) still looked slightly suspicious. <div class="bookquote">``Well --
let's drink to a Gryffindor victory against Ravenclaw! Not that I'm
supposed to take sides, as a teacher... ''  (<font color='red'><b>Harry/Potter/Harry Potter</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) added hastily

<p/>They drank the butterbeer in silence, until Harry voiced something he (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>)'d
been wondering for a while.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``What's under a dementor's hood?''

 (<font color='red'><b>Professor</b></font>)</div><p/>Professor Lupin lowered his (<font color='blue'><b>Professor</b></font>) bottle thoughtfully.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Hmmm... well, the only people who really know are in no condition to
tell us. You see, the dementor lowers its hood only to use its last and
worst weapon.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``What's that?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``They call it the Dementor's Kiss,''  (<font color='red'><b>Lupin/R. J. Lupin</b></font>)</div>said Lupin, with a slightly twisted
smile. <div class="bookquote">``It's what dementors do to those they wish to destroy utterly. I
suppose there must be some kind of mouth under there, because they clamp
their jaws upon the mouth of the victim and -- and suck out his (<font color='blue'><b>victim</b></font>) soul.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Harry/Potter/Harry Potter</b></font>)</div><p/>Harry accidentally spat out a bit of butterbeer.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``What -- they kill --?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Oh no,''  (<font color='red'><b>Lupin/R. J. Lupin</b></font>)</div>said Lupin. <div class="bookquote">``Much worse than that. You can exist without your
soul, you know, as long as your brain and heart are still working. But
you'll have no sense of self anymore, no memory, no. .. anything.
There's no chance at all of recovery. You'll just exist. As an empty
shell. And your soul is gone forever... lost.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Lupin/R. J. Lupin</b></font>)</div><p/>Lupin drank a little more butterbeer, then said, <div class="bookquote">``It's the fate that
awaits Sirius Black. It was in the Daily Prophet this morning. The
Ministry have given the dementors permission to perform it if they find
him (<font color='blue'><b>Prophet</b></font>).''

 (<font color='red'><b>Lupin/R. J. Lupin</b></font>)</div><p/>Harry sat stunned for a moment at the idea of someone having their soul
sucked out through their mouth. But then he (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) thought of Black.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``He (<font color='blue'><b>Prophet</b></font>) deserves it,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) said suddenly.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``You think so?''  (<font color='red'><b>Lupin/R. J. Lupin</b></font>)</div>said Lupin lightly. <div class="bookquote">``Do you really think anyone deserves
that?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Yes,''  (<font color='red'><b>Harry/Potter/Harry Potter</b></font>)</div>said Harry defiantly. <div class="bookquote">``For... for some things...''

 (<font color='red'><b>He</b></font>)</div><p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) would have liked to have told Lupin about the conversation he (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>)'d
overheard about Black in the Three Broomsticks, about Black betraying
his (<font color='blue'><b>Black</b></font>) mother and father, but it would have involved revealing that he (<font color='blue'><b>Black</b></font>)'d
gone to Hogsmeade without permission, and he (<font color='blue'><b>Black</b></font>) knew Lupin wouldn't be very
impressed by that. So he (<font color='blue'><b>Black</b></font>) finished his (<font color='blue'><b>Black</b></font>) butterbeer, thanked Lupin, and
left the History of Magic classroom.

<p/>Harry half wished that he (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) hadn't asked what was under a dementor's hood,
the answer had been so horrible, and he (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) was so lost in unpleasant
thoughts of what it would feel like to have your soul sucked out of you
that he (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) walked headlong into Professor McGonagall halfway up the stairs.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Do watch where you're going, Potter!''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Sorry, Professor --''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I've just been looking for you in the Gryffindor common room, Well,
here it is, we've done everything we could think of, and there doesn't
seem to be anything wrong with it at all. You've got a very good friend
somewhere, Potter...''

 (<font color='red'><b>Harry/Potter/Harry Potter</b></font>)</div><p/>Harry's jaw dropped. She (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) was holding out his (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) Firebolt, and it looked as
magnificent as ever.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``I can have it back?''  (<font color='red'><b>Harry/Potter/Harry Potter</b></font>)</div>Harry said weakly. <div class="bookquote">``Seriously?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Seriously,''  (<font color='red'><b>Professor</b></font>)</div>said Professor McGonagall, and she (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) was actually smiling. <div class="bookquote">``I
daresay you'll need to get the feel of it before Saturday's match, won't
you? And Potter -- do try and win, won't you? Or we'll be out of the
running for the eighth year. in a row, as Professor Snape was kind
enough to remind me only last night...''

 (<font color='red'><b>Harry/Potter/Harry Potter</b></font>)</div><p/>Speechless, Harry carried the Firebolt back upstairs toward Gryffindor
Tower. As he (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) turned a corner, he (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) saw Ron dashing toward him (<font color='blue'><b>Ron</b></font>), grinning
from ear to ear.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``She (<font color='blue'><b>You</b></font>) gave it to You? Excellent! Listen, can I still have a go on it?
Tomorrow?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Yeah... anything,''  (<font color='red'><b>Harry/Potter/Harry Potter</b></font>)</div>said Harry, his (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) heart lighter than it had been in a
month. <div class="bookquote">``You know what -- we should make up with Hermione... She (<font color='blue'><b>Hermione</b></font>) was
only trying to help...''

 (<font color='red'><b>Ron</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Yeah, all right,''  (<font color='red'><b>Ron</b></font>)</div>said Ron. <div class="bookquote">``She (<font color='blue'><b>Hermione</b></font>)'s in the common room how working, for
a change --''

 (<font color='red'><b>Gryffindor</b></font>)</div><p/>They turned into the corridor to Gryffindor Tower and saw Neville
Longbottom, pleading with Sir Cadogan, who seemed to be refusing him (<font color='blue'><b>Longbottom</b></font>)
entrance.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``I wrote them down!''  (<font color='red'><b>Neville/Neville Longbottom/Longbottom</b></font>)</div>Neville was saying tearfully. <div class="bookquote">``But I must've
dropped them somewhere!''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``A likely tale!''  (<font color='red'><b>Cadogan</b></font>)</div>roared Sir Cadogan. Then, spotting Harry and Ron: <div class="bookquote">``Good
even, my fine young yeomen! Come clap this loon in irons. He (<font color='blue'><b>loon</b></font>) is trying
to force entry to the chambers within!''

 (<font color='red'><b>Ron</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Oh, shut up,''  (<font color='red'><b>Ron</b></font>)</div>said Ron as he (<font color='blue'><b>Ron</b></font>) and Harry drew level with Neville.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``I've lost the passwords!''  (<font color='red'><b>Neville/Neville Longbottom/Longbottom</b></font>)</div>Neville told them miserably. <div class="bookquote">``I made him (<font color='blue'><b>loon</b></font>) tell
me what passwords he (<font color='blue'><b>loon</b></font>) was going to use this week, because he (<font color='blue'><b>loon</b></font>) keeps
changing them, and now I don't know what I've done with them!''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Oddsbodikins,''  (<font color='red'><b>Harry/Potter/Harry Potter</b></font>)</div>said Harry to Sir Cadogan, who looked extremely
disappointed and reluctantly swung forward to let them into the common
room. There was a sudden, excited murmur as every head turned and the
next moment, Harry was surrounded by people exclaiming over his (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>)
Firebolt.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Where'd you get it, Harry?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Will you let me have a go?''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``Have you ridden it yet, Harry?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Ravenclaw'll have no chance, they're all on Cleansweep Sevens!''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Can I just hold it, Harry?''

 (<font color='red'><b>Harry/Potter/Harry Potter</b></font>)</div><p/>After ten minutes or so, during which the Firebolt was Passed around and
admired from every angle, the crowd dispersed and Harry and Ron had a
clear view of Hermione, the only person who hadn't rushed over to them,
bent over her (<font color='blue'><b>Hermione</b></font>) work and carefully avoiding their eyes. Harry and Ron
approached her (<font color='blue'><b>Hermione</b></font>) table and at last, she (<font color='blue'><b>Hermione</b></font>) looked up.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``I got it back,''  (<font color='red'><b>Harry/Potter/Harry Potter</b></font>)</div>said Harry, grinning at her (<font color='blue'><b>Hermione</b></font>) and holding up the
Firebolt.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``See, Hermione? There wasn't anything wrong with it!''  (<font color='red'><b>Ron</b></font>)</div>said Ron.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Well -- there might have been!''  (<font color='red'><b>Hermione/HERMIONE</b></font>)</div>said Hermione. <div class="bookquote">``I mean, at least you
know now that it's safe!''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Yeah, I suppose so,''  (<font color='red'><b>Harry/Potter/Harry Potter</b></font>)</div>said Harry. <div class="bookquote">``Id better put it upstairs.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I'll take it!''  (<font color='red'><b>Ron</b></font>)</div>said Ron eagerly. <div class="bookquote">``I've got to give Scabbers his (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) rat
tonic.''

 (<font color='red'><b>He</b></font>)</div><p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) took the Firebolt and, holding it as if it were made of glass,
carried it away up the boys' staircase.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Can I sit down, then?''  (<font color='red'><b>Harry/Potter/Harry Potter</b></font>)</div>Harry asked Hermione.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``I suppose so,''  (<font color='red'><b>Hermione/HERMIONE</b></font>)</div>said Hermione, moving a great stack of parchment off a
chair.

<p/>Harry looked around at the cluttered table, at the long Arithmancy essay
on which the ink was still glistening, at the even longer Muggle Studies
essay -LRB-<div class="bookquote">``Explain Why Muggles Need Electricity''  (<font color='red'><b>Muggle</b></font>)</div>and at the rune
translation Hermione was now poring over.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``How are you getting through all this stuff?''  (<font color='red'><b>Harry/Potter/Harry Potter</b></font>)</div>Harry asked her (<font color='blue'><b>Hermione</b></font>).

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Oh, well -- you know -- working hard,''  (<font color='red'><b>Hermione/HERMIONE</b></font>)</div>said Hermione. Close-up, Harry
saw that she (<font color='blue'><b>Hermione</b></font>) looked almost as tired as Lupin.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Why don't you just drop a couple of subjects?''  (<font color='red'><b>Harry/Potter/Harry Potter</b></font>)</div>Harry asked, watching
her (<font color='blue'><b>Hermione</b></font>) lifting books as she (<font color='blue'><b>Hermione</b></font>) searched for her (<font color='blue'><b>Hermione</b></font>) rune dictionary.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``I couldn't do that!''  (<font color='red'><b>Hermione/HERMIONE</b></font>)</div>said Hermione, looking scandalized.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Arithmancy looks terrible,''  (<font color='red'><b>Harry/Potter/Harry Potter</b></font>)</div>said Harry, picking up a very
complicated-looking number chart.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Oh no, it's wonderful!''  (<font color='red'><b>Hermione/HERMIONE</b></font>)</div>said Hermione earnestly. <div class="bookquote">``It's my favorite
subject! It's --''

 (<font color='red'><b>Harry/Potter/Harry Potter</b></font>)</div><p/>But exactly what was wonderful about Arithmancy, Harry never found out.
At that precise moment, a strangled yell echoed down the boys'
staircase. The whole common room fell silent, staring, petrified, at the
entrance. Then came hurried footsteps, growing louder and louder -- and
then Ron came leaping into view, dragging with him (<font color='blue'><b>Ron</b></font>) a bedsheet.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``LOOK!''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Ron</b></font>) bellowed, striding over to Hermione's table.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``LOOK!''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Ron</b></font>) yelled, shaking the sheets in her (<font color='blue'><b>Hermione</b></font>) face.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Ron, what --?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``SCABBERS! LOOK! SCABBERS!''

 (<font color='red'><b>Hermione/HERMIONE</b></font>)</div><p/>Hermione was leaning away from Ron, looking utterly bewildered. Harry
looked down at the sheet Ron was holding. There was something red on it.
Something that looked horribly like --

<p/><div class="bookquote">``BLOOD!''  (<font color='red'><b>Ron</b></font>)</div>Ron yelled into the stunned silence. <div class="bookquote">``HE (<font color='blue'><b>Ron</b></font>)'S GONE! AND YOU KNOW
WHAT WAS ON THE FLOOR?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``N -- no,''  (<font color='red'><b>Hermione/HERMIONE</b></font>)</div>said Hermione in a trembling voice.

<p/>Ron threw something down onto Hermione's rune translation. Hermione and
Harry leaned forward. Lying on top of the weird, spiky shapes were
several long, ginger cat hairs.

<p/>CHAPTER THIRTEEN

<p/>GRYFFINDOR VERSUS RAVENCLAW

<p/>It looked like the end of Ron and Hermione's friendship. Each was so
angry with the other that Harry couldn't see how they'd ever make up.

<p/>Ron was enraged that Hermione had never taken Crookshanks's attempts to
eat Scabbers seriously, hadn't bothered to keep a close enough watch on
him (<font color='blue'><b>Ron</b></font>), and was still trying to pretend that Crookshanks was innocent by
suggesting that Ron look for Scabbers under all the boys' beds.
Hermione, meanwhile, maintained fiercely that Ron had no proof that
Crookshanks had eaten Scabbers, that the ginger hairs might have been
there since Christmas, and that Ron had been prejudiced against her (<font color='blue'><b>Hermione</b></font>) cat
ever since Crookshanks had landed on Ron's head in the Magical
Menagerie.

<p/>Personally, Harry was sure that Crookshanks had eaten Scabbers, and when
he (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) tried to point out to Hermione that the evidence all pointed that
way, she (<font color='blue'><b>Hermione</b></font>) lost her (<font color='blue'><b>Hermione</b></font>) temper with Harry too.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Okay, side with Ron, I knew you would!''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Hermione</b></font>) said shrilly. <div class="bookquote">``First the
Firebolt, now Scabbers, everything's my fault, isn't it! just leave me
alone, Harry, I've got a lot of work to do!''

 (<font color='red'><b>Ron</b></font>)</div><p/>Ron had taken the loss of his (<font color='blue'><b>Ron</b></font>) rat very hard indeed.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Come on, Ron, you were always saying how boring Scabbers was,''  (<font color='red'><b>Fred/Fred Weasley</b></font>)</div>said
Fred bracingly. <div class="bookquote">``And he (<font color='blue'><b>Ron</b></font>)'s been off-color for ages, he (<font color='blue'><b>Ron</b></font>) was wasting away.
It was probably better for him (<font color='blue'><b>Ron</b></font>) to snuff it quickly -- one swallow -- he (<font color='blue'><b>Ron</b></font>)
probably didn't feel a thing.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Fred!''  (<font color='red'><b>Ginny</b></font>)</div>said Ginny indignantly.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``All he (<font color='blue'><b>Fred</b></font>) did was eat and sleep, Ron, you said it yourself,''  (<font color='red'><b>George/George Weasley/Weasley</b></font>)</div>said George.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``He (<font color='blue'><b>Ron</b></font>) bit Goyle for us once!''  (<font color='red'><b>Ron</b></font>)</div>Ron said miserably. <div class="bookquote">``Remember, Harry?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Yeah, that's true,''  (<font color='red'><b>Harry/Potter/Harry Potter</b></font>)</div>said Harry.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``His (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) finest hour,''  (<font color='red'><b>Fred/Fred Weasley</b></font>)</div>said Fred, unable to keep a straight face. <div class="bookquote">``Let the
scar on Goyle's finger stand as a lasting tribute to his (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) memory. Oh,
come on, Ron, get yourself down to Hogsmeade and buy a new rat, what's
the point of moaning?''

 (<font color='red'><b>Ron</b></font>)</div><p/>In a last-ditch attempt to cheer Ron up, Harry persuaded him (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) to come
along to the Gryffindor team's final practice before the Ravenclaw
match, so that he (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) could have a ride on the Firebolt after they'd
finished. This did seem to take Ron's mind off Scabbers for a moment
-LRB-<div class="bookquote">``Great! Can I try and shoot a few goals on it?'' (<font color='red'><b>Ron</b></font>)</div>-RRB- so they set off for
the Quidditch field together.

<p/>Madam Hooch, who was still overseeing Gryffindor practices to keep an
eye on Harry, was just as impressed with the Firebolt as everyone else
had been. She (<font color='blue'><b>Hooch</b></font>) took it in her (<font color='blue'><b>Hooch</b></font>) hands before takeoff and gave them the
benefit of her (<font color='blue'><b>Hooch</b></font>) professional opinion.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Look at the balance on it! If the Nimbus series has a fault, it's a
slight list to the tail end -- you often find they develop a drag after
a few years. They've updated the handle too, a bit slimmer than the
Cleansweeps, reminds me of the old Silver Arrows -- a Pity they've
stopped making them. I learned to fly on one, and a very fine old broom
it was too...''

 (<font color='red'><b>She</b></font>)</div><p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>Hooch</b></font>) continued in this vein for some time, until Wood said, <div class="bookquote">``Er -- Madam
Hooch? Is it okay if Harry has the Firebolt back? We need to
practice...''

 (<font color='red'><b>Wood/Oliver/Oliver Wood</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Oh -- right -- here you are, then, Potter,''  (<font color='red'><b>Madam Hooch</b></font>)</div>said Madam Hooch. <div class="bookquote">``I'll sit
over here with Weasley...''

 (<font color='red'><b>She</b></font>)</div><p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>Hooch</b></font>) and Ron left the field to sit in the stadium, and the Gryffindor
team gathered around Wood for his (<font color='blue'><b>Wood</b></font>) final instructions for tomorrow's
match.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Harry, I've just found out who Ravenclaw is playing as Seeker. It's Cho
Chang. She (<font color='blue'><b>Hooch</b></font>)'s a fourth year, and she (<font color='blue'><b>Hooch</b></font>)'s pretty good... I really hoped she (<font color='blue'><b>Hooch</b></font>)
wouldn't be fit, she (<font color='blue'><b>Hooch</b></font>)'s had some problems with injuries...''  (<font color='red'><b>Wood/Oliver/Oliver Wood</b></font>)</div>Wood scowled
his (<font color='blue'><b>Wood</b></font>) displeasure that Cho Chang had made a full recovery, then said, <div class="bookquote">``On
the other hand, she (<font color='blue'><b>Hooch</b></font>) rides a Comet Two Sixty, which is going to look like
a joke next to the Firebolt.''  (<font color='red'><b>Cho/Cho Chang/Chang</b></font>)</div>He (<font color='blue'><b>Chang</b></font>) gave Harry's broom a look of fervent
admiration, then said, <div class="bookquote">``Okay, everyone, let's go -- ''

 (<font color='red'><b>Harry/Potter/Harry Potter</b></font>)</div><p/>And at long last, Harry mounted his (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) Firebolt, and kicked off from the
ground.

<p/>It was better than he (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>)'d ever dreamed. The Firebolt turned with the
lightest touch; it seemed to obey his (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) thoughts rather than his (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) grip; it
sped across the field at such speed that the stadium turned into a
green-and-gray blur; Harry turned it so sharply that Alicia Spinnet
screamed, then he (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) went into a perfectly controlled dive, brushing the
grassy field with his (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) toes before rising thirty, forty, fifty feet into
the air again.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Harry, I'm letting the Snitch out!''  (<font color='red'><b>Wood</b></font>)</div>Wood called.

<p/>Harry turned and raced a Bludger toward the goal posts; he (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) outstripped
it easily, saw the Snitch dart out from behind Wood, and within ten
seconds had caught it tightly in his (<font color='blue'><b>Wood</b></font>) hand.

<p/>The team cheered madly. Harry let the Snitch go again, gave it a
minute's head start, then tore after it, weaving in and out of the
others; he (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) spotted it lurking near Katie Bell's knee, looped her (<font color='blue'><b>Bell</b></font>) easily,
and caught it again.

<p/>It was the best practice ever; the team, inspired by the presence of the
Firebolt in their midst, performed their best moves faultlessly, and by
the time they hit the ground again, Wood didn't have a single criticism
to make, which, as George Weasley pointed out, was a first.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``I can't see what's going to stop us tomorrow!''  (<font color='red'><b>Wood/Oliver/Oliver Wood</b></font>)</div>said Wood. <div class="bookquote">``Not unless
-- Harry, you've sorted out your dementor problem, haven't you?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Yeah,''  (<font color='red'><b>Harry/Potter/Harry Potter</b></font>)</div>said Harry, thinking of his (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) feeble Patronus and wishing it were
stronger.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``The dementors won't turn up again, Oliver. Dumbledore'd go ballistic,''
 (<font color='red'><b>Fred/Fred Weasley</b></font>)</div>said Fred confidently.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Well, let's hope not,''  (<font color='red'><b>Wood/Oliver/Oliver Wood</b></font>)</div>said Wood. <div class="bookquote">``Anyway -- good work, everyone. Let's
get back to the tower... turn in early --''

 (<font color='red'><b>Harry/Potter/Harry Potter</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I'm staying out for a bit; Ron wants a go on the Firebolt,''  (<font color='red'><b>Harry/Potter/Harry Potter</b></font>)</div>Harry told
Wood, and while the rest of the team headed off to the locker rooms,
Harry strode over to Ron, who vaulted the barrier to the stands and came
to meet him (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>). Madam Hooch had fallen asleep in her (<font color='blue'><b>Hooch</b></font>) seat.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Here you go,''  (<font color='red'><b>Harry/Potter/Harry Potter</b></font>)</div>said Harry, handing Ron the Firebolt.

<p/>Ron, an expression of ecstasy on his (<font color='blue'><b>Ron</b></font>) face, mounted the broom and zoomed
off into the gathering darkness while Harry walked around the edge of
the field, watching him (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>). Night had fallen before Madam Hooch awoke with
a start, told Harry and Ron off for not waking her (<font color='blue'><b>Hooch</b></font>), and insisted that
they go back to the castle.

<p/>Harry shouldered the Firebolt and he (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) and Ron walked out of the shadowy
stadium, discussing the Firebolt's superbly smooth action, its
phenomenal acceleration, and its pinpoint turning. They were halfway
toward the castle when Harry, glancing to his (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) left, saw something that
made his (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) heart turn over -- a pair of eyes, gleaming out of the
darkness.

<p/>Harry stopped dead, his (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) heart banging against his (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) ribs.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``What's the matter?''  (<font color='red'><b>Ron</b></font>)</div>said Ron.

<p/>Harry pointed. Ron pulled out his (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) wand and muttered, <div class="bookquote">``Lumos!''

 (<font color='red'><b>Ron</b></font>)</div><p/>A beam of light fell across the grass, hit the bottom of a tree, and
illuminated its branches; there, crouching among the budding leaves, was
Crookshanks.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Get out of here!''  (<font color='red'><b>Ron</b></font>)</div>Ron roared, and he (<font color='blue'><b>Ron</b></font>) stooped down and seized a stone
lying on the grass, but before he (<font color='blue'><b>Ron</b></font>) could do anything else, Crookshanks
had vanished with one swish of his (<font color='blue'><b>Ron</b></font>) long ginger tail.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``See?''  (<font color='red'><b>Ron</b></font>)</div>Ron said furiously, chucking the stone down again. <div class="bookquote">``She (<font color='blue'><b>Oliver</b></font>)'s still
letting him (<font color='blue'><b>Ron</b></font>) wander about wherever he (<font color='blue'><b>Ron</b></font>) wants -- probably washing down
Scabbers with a couple of birds now...''

 (<font color='red'><b>Harry/Potter/Harry Potter</b></font>)</div><p/>Harry didn't say anything. He (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) took a deep breath as relief seeped
through him (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>); he (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) had been sure for a moment that those eyes had belonged
to the Grim. They set off for the castle once more. slightly ashamed of
his (<font color='blue'><b>Grim</b></font>) moment of panic, Harry didn't say anything to Ron -- nor did he (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) look
left or right until they had reached the well-lit entrance hall.

<p/>Harry went down to breakfast the next morning with the rest of the boys
in his (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) dormitory, all of whom seemed to think the Firebolt deserved a
sort of guard of honor. As Harry entered the Great Hall, heads turned in
the direction of the Firebolt, and there was a good deal of excited
muttering. Harry saw, with enormous satisfaction, that the Slytherin
team were all looking thunderstruck.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Did you see his (<font color='blue'><b>Ron</b></font>) face?''  (<font color='red'><b>Ron</b></font>)</div>said Ron gleefully, looking back at Malfay. <div class="bookquote">``He (<font color='blue'><b>Ron</b></font>)
can't believe it! This is brilliant!''

 (<font color='red'><b>Wood/Oliver/Oliver Wood</b></font>)</div><p/>Wood, too, was basking in the reflected glory of the Firebolt.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Put it here, Harry,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Ron</b></font>) said, laying the broom in the middle of the
table and carefully turning it so that its name faced upward. People
from the Ravenclaw and Hufflepuff tables were soon coming over to look.
Cedric Diggory came over to congratulate Harry on having acquired such a
superb replacement for his (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) Nimbus, and Percy's Ravenclaw girlfriend,
Penelope Clearwater, asked if she (<font color='blue'><b>Clearwater</b></font>) could actually hold the Firebolt.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Now, now, Penny, no sabotage!''  (<font color='red'><b>Percy/Weasley/Percy Weasley</b></font>)</div>said Percy heartily as she (<font color='blue'><b>Clearwater</b></font>) examined the
Firebolt closely. <div class="bookquote">``Penelope and I have got a bet on,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Percy</b></font>) told the team.
<div class="bookquote">``Ten Galleons on the outcome of the match!''

 (<font color='red'><b>Penelope/Penelope Clearwater</b></font>)</div><p/>Penelope put the Firebolt down again, thanked Harry, and went back to
her (<font color='blue'><b>Penelope</b></font>) table.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Harry -- make sure you win,''  (<font color='red'><b>Percy/Weasley/Percy Weasley</b></font>)</div>said Percy, in an urgent whisper. <div class="bookquote">``I
haven't got ten Galleons. Yes, I'm coming, Penny!''  (<font color='red'><b>her</b></font>)</div>And-he bustled off to
join her (<font color='blue'><b>Penelope</b></font>) in a piece of toast.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Sure you can manage that broom, Potter?''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>said a cold, drawling voice.

<p/>Draco Malfoy had arrived for a closer look, Crabbe and Coyle right
behind him (<font color='blue'><b>Coyle</b></font>).

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Yeah, reckon so,''  (<font color='red'><b>Harry/Potter/Harry Potter</b></font>)</div>said Harry casually.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Got plenty of special features, hasn't it?''  (<font color='red'><b>Malfoy/Draco Malfoy/Draco</b></font>)</div>said Malfoy, eyes
glittering maliciously. <div class="bookquote">``Shame it doesn't come with a parachute -- in
case you get too near a dementor.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Crabbe</b></font>)</div><p/>Crabbe and Goyle sniggered.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Pity you can't attach an extra arm to yours, Malfoy,''  (<font color='red'><b>Harry/Potter/Harry Potter</b></font>)</div>said Harry. <div class="bookquote">``Then
it could catch the Snitch for you.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Gryffindor</b></font>)</div><p/>The Gryffindor team laughed loudly. Malfoy's pale eyes narrowed, and he (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>)
stalked away. They watched him (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) rejoin the rest of the Slytherin team,
who put their heads together, no doubt asking Malfoy whether Harry's
broom really was a Firebolt.

<p/>At a quarter to eleven, the Gryffindor team set off for the locker
rooms. The weather couldn't have been more different from their match
against Hufflepuff. It was a clear, cool day with a very light breeze;
there would be no visibility problems this time, and Harry, though
nervous, was starting to feel the excitement only a Quidditch match
could bring. They could hear the rest of the school moving into the
stadium beyond. Harry took off his (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) black school robes, removed his (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) wand
from his (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) pocket, and stuck it inside the T-shirt he (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) was going to wear
under his (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) Quidditch robes. He (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) only hoped he (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) wouldn't need it. He (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>)
wondered suddenly whether Professor Lupin was in the crowd, watching.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``You know what we've got to do,''  (<font color='red'><b>Wood/Oliver/Oliver Wood</b></font>)</div>said Wood as they prepared to leave the
locker rooms. <div class="bookquote">``If we lose this match, we're out of the running. just --
just fly like you did in practice yesterday, and we'll be okay!''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/>They walked out onto the field to tumultuous applause. The Ravenclaw
team, dressed in blue, were already standing in the middle of the field.
Their Seeker, Cho Chang, was the only girl on their team. She (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) was
shorter than Harry by about a head, and Harry couldn't help noticing,
nervous as he (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) was, that she (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) was extremely pretty. She (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) smiled at Harry as
the teams faced each other behind their captains, and he (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) felt a slight
lurch in the region of his (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) stomach that he (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) didn't think had anything to
do with nerves.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Wood, Davies, shake hands,''  (<font color='red'><b>Madam Hooch</b></font>)</div>Madam Hooch said briskly, and Wood shook
hands with the Ravenclaw Captain.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Mount your brooms... on my whistle... three -- two -- one --''

 (<font color='red'><b>Harry/Potter/Harry Potter</b></font>)</div><p/>Harry kicked off into the air and the Firebolt zoomed higher and faster
than any other broom; he (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) soared around the stadium and began squinting
around for the Snitch, listening all the while to the commentary, which
was being provided by the Weasley twins' friend Lee Jordan.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``They're off, and the big excitement this match is the Firebolt that
Harry Potter is flying for Gryffindor. According to Which Broomstick,
the Firebolt's going to be the broom of choice for the national teams at
this year's World Championship --''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Jordan, would you mind telling us what's going on in the match?''
 (<font color='red'><b>Professor</b></font>)</div>interrupted Professor McGonagall's voice.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Right you are, Professor -- just giving a bit of background information
-- the Firebolt, incidentally, has a built-in auto-brake and --''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Jordan!''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Okay, okay, Gryffindor in possession, Katie Bell of Gryffindor, heading
for goal...''

 (<font color='red'><b>Harry/Potter/Harry Potter</b></font>)</div><p/>Harry streaked past Katie in the opposite direction, gazing around for a
glint of gold and noticing that Cho Chang was tailing him (<font color='blue'><b>Chang</b></font>) closely. She (<font color='blue'><b>Katie</b></font>)
was undoubtedly a very good flier -- she (<font color='blue'><b>Katie</b></font>) kept cutting across him (<font color='blue'><b>Chang</b></font>),
forcing him (<font color='blue'><b>Chang</b></font>) to change direction.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Show her (<font color='blue'><b>Bell</b></font>) your acceleration, Harry!''  (<font color='red'><b>Fred/Fred Weasley</b></font>)</div>Fred yelled as he (<font color='blue'><b>Fred</b></font>) whooshed past in
pursuit of a Bludger that was aiming for Alicia.

<p/>Harry urged the Firebolt forward as they rounded the Ravenclaw goal
posts and Cho fell behind. Just as Katie succeeded in scoring the first
goal of the match, and the Gryffindor end of the field went wild, he (<font color='blue'><b>Cho</b></font>) saw
it -- the Snitch was close to the ground, flitting near one of the
barriers.

<p/>Harry dived; Cho saw what he (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) was doing and tore after him (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) -- Harry was
speeding up, excitement flooding him (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>); dives were his (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) speciality, he (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) was
ten feet away --

<p/>Then a Bludger, hit by one of the Ravenclaw Beaters, came pelting out of
nowhere; Harry veered off course, avoiding it by an inch, and in those
few, crucial seconds, the Snitch had vanished.

<p/>There was a great <div class="bookquote">``Ooooooh''  (<font color='red'><b>Gryffindor</b></font>)</div>of disappointment from the Gryffindor
supporters, but much applause for their Beater from the Ravenclaw end.
George Weasley vented his (<font color='blue'><b>Weasley</b></font>) feelings by hitting the second Bludger
directly at the offending Beater, who was forced to roll right over in
midair to avoid it.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Gryffindor leads by eighty points to zero, and look at that Firebolt
go! Potter's really putting it through its paces now, see it turn --
Chang's Comet is just no match for it, the Firebolt's precision- balance
is really noticeable in these long --''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``JORDAN! ARE YOU BEING PAID TO ADVERTISE FIREBOLTS? GET ON WITH THE
COMMENTARY!''

 (<font color='red'><b>Ravenclaw</b></font>)</div><p/>Ravenclaw was pulling back; they had now scored three goals, which put
Gryffindor only fifty points ahead -- if Cho got the Snitch before him (<font color='blue'><b>Cho</b></font>),
Ravenclaw would win. Harry dropped lower, narrowly avoiding a Ravenclaw
Chaser, scanning the field frantically -- a glint of gold, a flutter of
tiny wings -- the Snitch was circling the Gryffindor goal post --

<p/>Harry accelerated, eyes fixed on the speck of gold ahead -- but just
then, Cho appeared out of thin air, blocking him (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) --

<p/><div class="bookquote">``HARRY, THIS IS NO TIME TO BE A GENTLEMAN!''  (<font color='red'><b>him</b></font>)</div>Wood roared as Harry swerved
to avoid a collision. <div class="bookquote">``KNOCK HER OFF HER BROOM IF YOU HAVE TO!''

 (<font color='red'><b>Harry/Potter/Harry Potter</b></font>)</div><p/>Harry turned and caught sight of Cho; she (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) was grinning. The Snitch had
vanished again. Harry turned his (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) Firebolt upward and was soon twenty
feet above the game. Out of the corner of his (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) eye, he (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) saw Cho following
him (<font color='blue'><b>Cho</b></font>)... She (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>)'d decided to mark him (<font color='blue'><b>Cho</b></font>) rather than search for the Snitch
herself... All right, then... if she (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) wanted to tail him (<font color='blue'><b>Cho</b></font>), she (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>)'d have to
take the consequences...

<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Cho</b></font>) dived again, and Cho, thinking he (<font color='blue'><b>Cho</b></font>)'d seen the Snitch, tried to follow;
Harry pulled out of the dive very sharply; she (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) hurtled downward; he (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) rose
fast as a bullet once more, and then saw it, for the third time -- the
Snitch was glittering way above the field at the Ravenclaw end.

<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) accelerated; so, many feet below, did Cho. He (<font color='blue'><b>Cho</b></font>) was winning, gaining on
the Snitch with every second -- then --

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Oh!''  (<font color='red'><b>He</b></font>)</div>screamed Cho, pointing.

<p/>Distracted, Harry looked down.

<p/>Three dementors, three tall, black, hooded dementors, were looking up at
him (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>).

<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) didn't stop to think. Plunging a hand down the neck of his (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) robes, he (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>)
whipped out his (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) wand and roared, <div class="bookquote">``Expecto patronum!''

 (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div><p/>Something silver-white, something enormous, erupted from the end of his (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>)
wand. He (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) knew it had shot directly at the dementors but didn't pause to
watch; his (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) mind still miraculously clear, he (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) looked ahead -- he (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) was
nearly there. He (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) stretched out the hand still grasping his (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) wand and just
managed to close his (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) fingers over the small, struggling Snitch.

<p/>Madam Hooch's whistle sounded. Harry turned around in midair and saw six
scarlet blurs bearing down on him (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>); next moment, the whole team was
hugging him (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) so hard he (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) was nearly pulled off his (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) broom. Down below he (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>)
could hear the roars of the Gryffindors in the crowd.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``That's my boy!''  (<font color='red'><b>Wood/Oliver/Oliver Wood</b></font>)</div>Wood kept yelling. Alicia, Angelina, and Katie had all
kissed Harry; Fred had him (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) in a grip so tight Harry felt as though his (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>)
head would come off In complete disarray, the team managed to make its
way back to the ground. Harry got off his (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) broom and looked up to see a
gaggle of Gryffindor supporters sprinting onto the field, Ron in the
lead. Before he (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) knew it, he (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) had been engulfed by the cheering crowd.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Yes!''  (<font color='red'><b>Ron</b></font>)</div>Ron yelled, yanking Harry's arm into the air. <div class="bookquote">``Yes! Yes!''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Well done, Harry!''  (<font color='red'><b>Percy/Weasley/Percy Weasley</b></font>)</div>said Percy, looking delighted. <div class="bookquote">``Ten Galleons to me!
Must find Penelope, excuse me --''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Good for you, Harry!''  (<font color='red'><b>Seamus Finnigan/Seamus</b></font>)</div>roared Seamus Finnigan.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Ruddy brilliant!''  (<font color='red'><b>Hagrid</b></font>)</div>boomed Hagrid over the heads of the milling
Gryffindors.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``That was quite some Patronus,''  (<font color='red'><b>Harry/Potter/Harry Potter</b></font>)</div>said a voice in Harry's ear.

<p/>Harry turned around to see Professor Lupin, who looked both shaken and
pleased.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``The dementors didn't affect me at all!''  (<font color='red'><b>Harry/Potter/Harry Potter</b></font>)</div>Harry said excitedly. <div class="bookquote">``I didn't
feel a thing!''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``That would be because they -- er -- weren't dementors,''  (<font color='red'><b>Professor</b></font>)</div>said Professor
Lupin. <div class="bookquote">``Come and see -- ''

 (<font color='red'><b>He</b></font>)</div><p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) led Harry out of the crowd until they were able to see the edge of
the field.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``You gave Mr. Malfoy quite a fright,''  (<font color='red'><b>Lupin/R. J. Lupin</b></font>)</div>said Lupin.

<p/>Harry stared. Lying in a crumpled heap on the ground were Malfoy,
Crabbe, Goyle, and Marcus Flint, the Slytherin team Captain, all
struggling to remove themselves from long, black, hooded robes. It
looked as though Malfoy had been standing on Goyle's shoulders. Standing
over them, with an expression of the utmost fury on her (<font color='blue'><b>them</b></font>) face, was
Professor McGonagall.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``An unworthy trick!''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>them</b></font>) was shouting. <div class="bookquote">``A low and cowardly attempt to
sabotage the Gryffindor Seeker! Detention for all of you, and fifty
points from Slytherin! I shall be speaking to Professor Dumbledore about
this, make no mistake! Ah, here he (<font color='blue'><b>Professor</b></font>) comes now!''

 (<font color='red'><b>Gryffindor</b></font>)</div><p/>If anything could have set the seal on Gryffindor's victory, it was
this. Ron, who had fought his (<font color='blue'><b>Ron</b></font>) way through to Harry's side, doubled up
with laughter as they watched Malfoy fighting to extricate himself from
the robe, Goyle's head still stuck inside it.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Come on, Harry!''  (<font color='red'><b>George/George Weasley/Weasley</b></font>)</div>said George, fighting his (<font color='blue'><b>George</b></font>) way over. <div class="bookquote">``Party! Gryffindor
common room, now!''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Right,''  (<font color='red'><b>Harry/Potter/Harry Potter</b></font>)</div>said Harry, and feeling happier than he (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) had in ages, he (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) and the
rest of the team led the way, still in their scarlet robes, out of the
stadium and back up to the castle.

<p/>It felt as though they had already won the Quidditch Cup; the party went
on all day and well into the night. Fred and George Weasley disappeared
for a couple of hours and returned with armfuls of bottles of
butterbeer, pumpkin fizz, and several bags full of Honeydukes sweets.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``How did you do that?''  (<font color='red'><b>Johnson/Angelina Johnson</b></font>)</div>squealed Angelina Johnson as George started
throwing Peppermint Toads into the crowd.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``With a little help from Moony, Wormtail, Padfoot, and Prongs,''  (<font color='red'><b>Fred/Fred Weasley</b></font>)</div>Fred
muttered in Harry's ear.

<p/>Only one person wasn't joining in the festivities. Hermione, incredibly,
was sitting in a corner, attempting to read an enormous book entitled
Home Life and Social Habits of British Muggles. Harry broke away from
the table where Fred and George had started juggling butterbeer bottles
and went over to her (<font color='blue'><b>Hermione</b></font>).

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Did you even come to the match?''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) asked her (<font color='blue'><b>Hermione</b></font>).

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Of course I did,''  (<font color='red'><b>Hermione/HERMIONE</b></font>)</div>said Hermione in a strangely high-pitched voice, not
looking up. <div class="bookquote">``And I'm very glad we won, and I think you did really well,
but I need to read this by Monday.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Come on, Hermione, come and have some food,''  (<font color='red'><b>Harry/Potter/Harry Potter</b></font>)</div>Harry said, looking over
at Ron and wondering whether he (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) was in a good enough mood to bury the
hatchet.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``I can't, Harry. I've still got four hundred and twenty-two pages to
read!''  (<font color='red'><b>Hermione/HERMIONE</b></font>)</div>said Hermione, now sounding slightly hysterical. <div class="bookquote">``Anyway...''  (<font color='red'><b>She</b></font>)</div>She (<font color='blue'><b>Hermione</b></font>)
glanced over at Ron too. <div class="bookquote">``He (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) doesn't want me to join in.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Ron</b></font>)</div><p/>There was no arguing with this, as Ron chose that moment to say loudly,
<div class="bookquote">``If Scabbers hadn't just been eaten, he (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) could have had some of those
Fudge Flies. He (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) used to really like them --''

 (<font color='red'><b>Ron</b></font>)</div><p/>Hermione burst into tears. Before Harry could say or do anything, she (<font color='blue'><b>Hermione</b></font>)
tucked the enormous book under her (<font color='blue'><b>Hermione</b></font>) arm, and, still sobbing, ran toward
the staircase to the girls' dormitories and out of sight.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Can't you give her (<font color='blue'><b>Hermione</b></font>) a break?''  (<font color='red'><b>Harry/Potter/Harry Potter</b></font>)</div>Harry asked Ron quietly.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``No,''  (<font color='red'><b>Ron</b></font>)</div>said Ron flatly. <div class="bookquote">``If she (<font color='blue'><b>Hermione</b></font>) just acted like she (<font color='blue'><b>Hermione</b></font>) was sorry -- but
she (<font color='blue'><b>Hermione</b></font>)'ll never admit she (<font color='blue'><b>Hermione</b></font>)'s wrong, Hermione. She (<font color='blue'><b>Hermione</b></font>)'s still acting like
Scabbers has gone on vacation or something.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Gryffindor</b></font>)</div><p/>The Gryffindor party ended only when Professor McGonagall turned up in
her (<font color='blue'><b>Hermione</b></font>) tartan dressing gown and hair net at one in the morning, to insist
that they all go to bed. Harry and Ron climbed the stairs to their
dormitory, still discussing the match. At last, exhausted, Harry climbed
into bed, twitched the hangings of his (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) four-poster shut to block out a
ray of moonlight, lay back, and felt himself almost instantly drifting
off to sleep...

<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) had a very strange dream. He (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) was walking through a forest, his (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>)
Firebolt over his (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) shoulder, following something silvery-white. It was
winding its way through the trees ahead, and he (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) could only catch
glimpses of it between the leaves. Anxious to catch up with it, he (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) sped
up, but as he (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) moved faster, so did his (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) quarry. Harry broke into a run,
and ahead he (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) heard hooves gathering speed. Now he (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) was running flat out,
and ahead he (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) could hear galloping. Then he (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) turned a corner into a
clearing and -

<p/><div class="bookquote">``AAARRGGHH! NOOO!''

 (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div><p/>Harry woke as suddenly as though he (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>)'d been hit in the face. Disoriented
in the total darkness, he (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) fumbled with his (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) hangings, he (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) could hear
movements around him (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>), and Seamus Finnigan's voice from the other side of
the room: <div class="bookquote">``What's going on?''

 (<font color='red'><b>Seamus Finnigan/Seamus</b></font>)</div><p/>Harry thought he (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) heard the dormitory door slam. At last finding the
divide in his (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) curtains, he (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) ripped them back, and at the same moment,
Dean Thomas lit his (<font color='blue'><b>Thomas</b></font>) lamp.

<p/>Ron was sitting up in bed, the hangings torn from one side, a look of
utmost terror on his (<font color='blue'><b>Ron</b></font>) face.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Black! Sirius Black! With a knife!''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``What?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Here! Just now! Slashed the curtains! Woke me up!''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``You sure you weren't dreaming, Ron?''  (<font color='red'><b>Dean Thomas/Dean</b></font>)</div>said Dean.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Look at the curtains! I tell you, he (<font color='blue'><b>Ron</b></font>) was here!''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/>They all scrambled out of bed; Harry reached the dormitory door first,
and they sprinted back down the staircase. Doors opened behind them, and
sleepy voices called after them.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Who shouted?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``What're you doing?''

 (<font color='red'><b>the party</b></font>)</div><p/>The common room was lit with the glow of the dying fire, still littered
with the debris from the party. It was deserted.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Are you sure you weren't dreaming, Ron?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I'm telling you, I saw him (<font color='blue'><b>Ron</b></font>)!''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``What's all the noise?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Professor McGonagall told us to go to bed!''

 (<font color='red'><b>the girls</b></font>)</div><p/>A few of the girls had come down their staircase, pulling or, dressing
gowns and yawning. Boys, too, were reappearing.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Excellent, are we carrying on?''  (<font color='red'><b>Fred/Fred Weasley</b></font>)</div>said Fred Weasley brightly.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Everyone back upstairs!''  (<font color='red'><b>Percy/Weasley/Percy Weasley</b></font>)</div>said Percy, hurrying into the common room and
pinning his (<font color='blue'><b>Percy</b></font>) Head Boy badge to his (<font color='blue'><b>Percy</b></font>) pajamas as he (<font color='blue'><b>Percy</b></font>) spoke.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Perce -- Sirius Black!''  (<font color='red'><b>Ron</b></font>)</div>said Ron faintly. <div class="bookquote">``In our dormitory! With a
knife! Woke me up!''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/>The common room went very still.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Nonsense!''  (<font color='red'><b>Percy/Weasley/Percy Weasley</b></font>)</div>said Percy, looking startled. <div class="bookquote">``You had too much to eat, Ron
-- had a nightmare --''

 (<font color='red'><b>Professor</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I'm telling you --''

 (<font color='red'><b>Professor</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Now, really, enough's enough!''

 (<font color='red'><b>Professor</b></font>)</div><p/>Professor McGonagall was back. She (<font color='blue'><b>Percy</b></font>) slammed the portrait behind her (<font color='blue'><b>Percy</b></font>) as
she (<font color='blue'><b>Percy</b></font>) entered the common room and stared furiously around.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``I am delighted that Gryffindor won the match, but this is getting
ridiculous! Percy, I expected better of you!''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I certainly didn't authorize this, Professor!''  (<font color='red'><b>Percy/Weasley/Percy Weasley</b></font>)</div>said Percy, puffing
himself up indignantly. <div class="bookquote">``I was just telling them all to get back to bed!
My brother Ron here had a nightmare --''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/>``IT WASN``T A NIGHTMARE!'' Ron yelled. <div class="bookquote">``PROFESSOR, I WOKE UP, AND SIRIUS
BLACK WAS STANDING OVER ME, HOLDING A KNIFE!''

 (<font color='red'><b>Professor</b></font>)</div><p/>Professor McGonagall stared at him (<font color='blue'><b>Ron</b></font>).

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Don't be ridiculous, Weasley, how could he (<font color='blue'><b>Weasley</b></font>) possibly have gotten through
the portrait hole?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Ask him (<font color='blue'><b>Weasley</b></font>)!''  (<font color='red'><b>Ron</b></font>)</div>said Ron, pointing a shaking finger at the back of Sir
Cadogan's picture. <div class="bookquote">``Ask him (<font color='blue'><b>Weasley</b></font>) if he (<font color='blue'><b>Weasley</b></font>) saw --''

 (<font color='red'><b>Ron</b></font>)</div><p/>Glaring suspiciously at Ron, Professor McGonagall pushed the Portrait
back open and went outside. The whole common room listened with bated
breath. <div class="bookquote">``Sir Cadogan, did you just let a man enter Gryffindor Tower?''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``Certainly, good lady!''  (<font color='red'><b>Cadogan</b></font>)</div>cried Sir Cadogan.

<p/>There was a stunned silence, both inside and outside the common room.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``You -- you did?''  (<font color='red'><b>Professor</b></font>)</div>said Professor McGonagall. <div class="bookquote">``But -- but the password!''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``He (<font color='blue'><b>Weasley</b></font>) had 'em!''  (<font color='red'><b>Cadogan</b></font>)</div>said Sir Cadogan proudly. <div class="bookquote">``Had the whole week's, my lady!
Read 'em off a little piece of paper!''

 (<font color='red'><b>Professor</b></font>)</div><p/>Professor McGonagall pulled herself back through the portrait hole to
face the stunned crowd. She (<font color='blue'><b>Ron</b></font>) was white as chalk.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Which person,''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Ron</b></font>) said, her (<font color='blue'><b>Ron</b></font>) voice shaking, <div class="bookquote">``which abysmally foolish
person wrote down this week's passwords and left them lying around?''

 (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div><p/>There was utter silence, broken by the smallest of terrified squeaks.
Neville Longbottom, trembling from head to fluffy slippered toes, raised
his (<font color='blue'><b>Longbottom</b></font>) hand slowly into the air.

<p/>CHAPTER FOURTEEN

<p/>SNAPE``S GRUDGE

<p/>No one in Gryffindor Tower slept that night. They knew that the castle
was being searched again, and the whole House stayed awake in the common
room, waiting to hear whether Black had been caught. Professor
McGonagall came back at dawn, to tell them that he (<font color='blue'><b>Professor</b></font>) had again escaped.

<p/>Throughout the day, everywhere they went they saw signs of tighter
security; Professor Flitwick could be seen teaching the front doors to
recognize a large picture of Sirius Black; Filch was suddenly bustling
up and down the corridors, boarding up everything from tiny cracks in
the walls to mouse holes. Sir Cadogan had been fired. His (<font color='blue'><b>Black</b></font>) portrait had
been taken back to its lonely landing on the seventh floor, and the Fat
Lady was back. She (<font color='blue'><b>Lady</b></font>) had been expertly restored, but was still extremely
nervous, and had agreed to return to her (<font color='blue'><b>Lady</b></font>) job only on condition that she (<font color='blue'><b>Lady</b></font>)
was given extra protection. A bunch of surly security trolls had been
hired to guard her (<font color='blue'><b>Lady</b></font>). They paced the corridor in a menacing group, talking
in grunts and comparing the size of their clubs.

<p/>Harry couldn't help noticing that the statue of the one-eyed witch on
the third floor remained unguarded and unblocked. It seemed that Fred
and George had been right in thinking that they -- and now Harry, Ron,
and Hermione -- were the only ones who knew about the hidden passageway
within it.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``D'you reckon we should tell someone?''  (<font color='red'><b>Harry/Potter/Harry Potter</b></font>)</div>Harry asked Ron.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``We know he (<font color='blue'><b>Ron</b></font>)'s not coming in through Honeyduke's,''  (<font color='red'><b>Ron</b></font>)</div>said Ron dismissively.
<div class="bookquote">``We'd've heard if the shop had been broken into.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Harry/Potter/Harry Potter</b></font>)</div><p/>Harry was glad Ron took this view. If the one-eyed witch was boarded up
too, he (<font color='blue'><b>Ron</b></font>) would never be able to go into Hogsmeade again.

<p/>Ron had become an instant celebrity. For the first time in his (<font color='blue'><b>Ron</b></font>) life,
people were paying more attention to him (<font color='blue'><b>Ron</b></font>) than to Harry, and it was clear
that Ron was rather enjoying the experience. Though still severely
shaken by the night's events, he (<font color='blue'><b>Ron</b></font>) was happy to tell anyone who asked what
had happened, with a wealth of detail.

<p/>''... I was asleep, and I heard this ripping noise, and I thought it was
in my dream, you know? But then there was this draft... I woke up and
one side of the hangings on my bed had been pulled down... I rolled
over... and I saw him (<font color='blue'><b>Ron</b></font>) standing over me... like a skeleton, with loads of
filthy hair ... holding this great long knife, must've been twelve
inches... and he (<font color='blue'><b>Ron</b></font>) looked at me, and I looked at him (<font color='blue'><b>Ron</b></font>), and then I yelled,
and he (<font color='blue'><b>Ron</b></font>) scampered.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Why, though?''  (<font color='red'><b>Ron</b></font>)</div>Ron added to Harry as the group of secondyear girls who
had been listening to his (<font color='blue'><b>Ron</b></font>) chilling tale departed. <div class="bookquote">``Why did he (<font color='blue'><b>Ron</b></font>) run?''

 (<font color='red'><b>Harry/Potter/Harry Potter</b></font>)</div><p/>Harry had been wondering the same thing. Why had Black, having got the
wrong bed, not silenced Ron and proceeded to Harry? Black had proved
twelve years ago that he (<font color='blue'><b>Black</b></font>) didn't mind murdering innocent people, and this
time he (<font color='blue'><b>Black</b></font>) had been facing five unarmed boys, four of whom were asleep.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``He (<font color='blue'><b>Ron</b></font>) must've known he (<font color='blue'><b>Ron</b></font>)'d have a job getting back out of the castle once
you'd yelled and woken people up,''  (<font color='red'><b>Harry/Potter/Harry Potter</b></font>)</div>said Harry thoughtfully. <div class="bookquote">``He (<font color='blue'><b>Ron</b></font>)'d've had
to kill the whole House to get back through the portrait hole... then he (<font color='blue'><b>Ron</b></font>)
would' ve met the teachers...''

 (<font color='red'><b>Neville/Neville Longbottom/Longbottom</b></font>)</div><p/>Neville was in total disgrace. Professor McGonagall was so furious with
him (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) she (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) had banned him (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) from all future Hogsmeade visits, given him (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) a
detention, and forbidden anyone to give him (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) the password into the tower.
Poor Neville was forced to wait. outside the common room every night for
somebody to let him (<font color='blue'><b>Neville</b></font>) in, while the security trolls leered unpleasantly at
him (<font color='blue'><b>Neville</b></font>). None of these punishments, however, came close to matching the one
his (<font color='blue'><b>Neville</b></font>) grandmother had in store for him (<font color='blue'><b>Neville</b></font>). Two days after Black's break-in,
she (<font color='blue'><b>grandmother</b></font>) sent Neville the very worst thing a Hogwarts student could receive
over breakfast -- a Howler.

<p/>The school owls swooped into the Great Hall carrying the mail as usual,
and Neville choked as a huge barn owl landed in front of him (<font color='blue'><b>Neville</b></font>), a scarlet
envelope clutched in its beak. Harry and Ron, who were sitting opposite
him (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>), recognized the letter as a Howler at once -- Ron had got one from
his (<font color='blue'><b>Ron</b></font>) mother the year before.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Run for it, Neville,''  (<font color='red'><b>Ron</b></font>)</div>Ron advised.

<p/>Neville didn't need telling twice. He (<font color='blue'><b>Neville</b></font>) seized the envelope, and holding
it before him (<font color='blue'><b>Neville</b></font>) like a bomb, sprinted out of the hall, while the Slytherin
table exploded with laughter at the sight of him (<font color='blue'><b>Neville</b></font>). They heard the Howler
go off in the entrance hall -- Neville's grandmother's voice, magically
magnified to a hundred times its Usual volume, shrieking about how he (<font color='blue'><b>Neville</b></font>)
had brought shame on the whole family.

<p/>Harry was too busy feeling sorry for Neville to notice immediately that
he (<font color='blue'><b>Neville</b></font>) had a letter too. Hedwig got his (<font color='blue'><b>Neville</b></font>) attention by nipping him (<font color='blue'><b>Neville</b></font>) sharply on
the wrist.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Ouch! Oh -- thanks, Hedwig.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Harry/Potter/Harry Potter</b></font>)</div><p/>Harry tore open the envelope while Hedwig helped herself to some of
Neville's cornflakes. The note inside said:

<p/>Dear Harry and Ron, How Abut having tea with me this afternoon `round
six? I'll come collect you from the castle. WAIT FOR ME IN THE ENTRANCE
HALL; YOU``RE NOT ALLOWED OUT ON YOUR OWN. Cheers, Hagrid

<p/><div class="bookquote">``He (<font color='blue'><b>Neville</b></font>) probably wants to hear all about Black!''  (<font color='red'><b>Ron</b></font>)</div>said Ron.

<p/>So at six o'clock that afternoon, Harry and Ron left Gryffindor Tower,
passed the security trolls at a run, and headed down to the entrance
hall.

<p/>Hagrid was already waiting for them.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``All right, Hagrid!''  (<font color='red'><b>Ron</b></font>)</div>said Ron. <div class="bookquote">``S'pose you want to hear about Saturday
night, do you?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I've already heard all abou' it,''  (<font color='red'><b>Hagrid</b></font>)</div>said Hagrid, opening the front doors
and leading them outside.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Oh,''  (<font color='red'><b>Ron</b></font>)</div>said Ron, looking slightly put out.

<p/>The first thing they saw on entering Hagrid's cabin was Buckbeak, who
was stretched out on top of Hagrid's patchwork quilt, his (<font color='blue'><b>Ron</b></font>) enormous wings
folded tight to his (<font color='blue'><b>Ron</b></font>) body, enjoying a large plate of dead ferrets.
Averting his (<font color='blue'><b>Ron</b></font>) eyes from this unpleasant sight, Harry saw a gigantic,
hairy brown suit and a very horrible yellow-and-orange tie hanging from
the top of Hagrid's wardrobe door.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``What are they for, Hagrid?''  (<font color='red'><b>Harry/Potter/Harry Potter</b></font>)</div>said Harry.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Buckbeaks case against the Committee fer the Disposal o' Dangerous
Creatures,''  (<font color='red'><b>Hagrid</b></font>)</div>said Hagrid. <div class="bookquote">``This Friday. Him (<font color='blue'><b>Black</b></font>) an' me'll be goin' down ter
London together. I've booked two beds on the Knight Bus...''

 (<font color='red'><b>Harry/Potter/Harry Potter</b></font>)</div><p/>Harry felt a nasty pang of guilt. He (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) had completely forgotten that
Buckbeak's trial was so near, and judging by the uneasy look on Ron's
face, he (<font color='blue'><b>Ron</b></font>) had too. They had also forgotten their promise about helping
him (<font color='blue'><b>Ron</b></font>) prepare Buckbeak's defense; the arrival of the Firebolt had driven
it clean out of their minds.

<p/>Hagrid poured them tea and offered them a plate of Bath buns but they
knew better than to accept; they had had too much experience with
Hagrid's cooking.

<p/>I got somethin' ter discuss with you two,'' said Hagrid, sitting himself
between them and looking uncharacteristically serious.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``What?''  (<font color='red'><b>Harry/Potter/Harry Potter</b></font>)</div>said Harry.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Hermione,''  (<font color='red'><b>Hagrid</b></font>)</div>said Hagrid.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``What about her (<font color='blue'><b>Hermione</b></font>)?''  (<font color='red'><b>Ron</b></font>)</div>said Ron.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``She (<font color='blue'><b>Hermione</b></font>)'s in a righ' state, that's what. She (<font color='blue'><b>Hermione</b></font>)'s bin comin' down ter visit me
a lot since Chris`mas. Bin feelin' lonely. Firs' yeh weren' talking to
her (<font color='blue'><b>Hermione</b></font>) because o' the Firebolt, now yer not talkin' to her (<font color='blue'><b>Hermione</b></font>) because her (<font color='blue'><b>Hermione</b></font>) cat
--''

 (<font color='red'><b>Ron</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">''-- ate Scabbers!''  (<font color='red'><b>Ron</b></font>)</div>Ron interjected angrily.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Because her (<font color='blue'><b>Hermione</b></font>) cat acted like all cats do,''  (<font color='red'><b>Hagrid</b></font>)</div>Hagrid continued doggedly.
<div class="bookquote">``She (<font color='blue'><b>Hermione</b></font>)'s cried a fair few times, yeh know. Goin' through a rough time at
the moment. Bitten off more'n she (<font color='blue'><b>Hermione</b></font>) can chew, if yeh ask me, all the work
she (<font color='blue'><b>Hermione</b></font>)'s tryin' ter do. Still found time ter help me with Buckbeak's case,
mind... She (<font color='blue'><b>Hermione</b></font>)'s found some really good stuff fer me... reckon he (<font color='blue'><b>Goin</b></font>)'ll stand
a good chance now...''

 (<font color='red'><b>Harry/Potter/Harry Potter</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Hagrid, we should've helped as well -- sorry --''  (<font color='red'><b>Harry/Potter/Harry Potter</b></font>)</div>Harry began awkwardly.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``I'm not blamin' yeh!''  (<font color='red'><b>Hagrid</b></font>)</div>said Hagrid, waving Harry's apology aside. <div class="bookquote">``Gawd
knows yeh've had enough ter be gettin' on with. I've seen yeh practicin'
Quidditch ev'ry hour o' the day an' night -- but I gotta tell yeh, I
thought you two'd value yer friend more'n broomsticks or rats. Tha's
all.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Harry/Potter/Harry Potter</b></font>)</div><p/>Harry and Ron exchanged uncomfortable looks.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Really upset, she (<font color='blue'><b>I</b></font>) was, when Black nearly stabbed yeh, Ron. She (<font color='blue'><b>I</b></font>)'s got
her (<font color='blue'><b>I</b></font>) heart in the right place, Hermione has, an' you two not talkin' to
her (<font color='blue'><b>Hermione</b></font>) --''

 (<font color='red'><b>Ron</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``If she (<font color='blue'><b>Hermione</b></font>)'d just get rid of that cat, I'd speak to her (<font color='blue'><b>Hermione</b></font>) again!''  (<font color='red'><b>Ron</b></font>)</div>Ron said
angrily. <div class="bookquote">``But she (<font color='blue'><b>Hermione</b></font>)'s still sticking up for it! It's a maniac, and she (<font color='blue'><b>Hermione</b></font>)
won't hear a word against it!''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Ah, well, people can be a bit stupid abou' their pets,''  (<font color='red'><b>Hagrid</b></font>)</div>said Hagrid
wisely. Behind him (<font color='blue'><b>Ron</b></font>), Buckbeak spat a few ferret bones onto Hagrid's
pillow.

<p/>They spent the rest of their visit discussing Gryffindor's improved
chances for the Quidditch Cup. At nine o'clock, Hagrid walked them back
up to the castle.

<p/>A large group of people was bunched around the bulletin board when they
returned to the common room.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Hogsmeade, next weekend!''  (<font color='red'><b>Ron</b></font>)</div>said Ron, craning over the heads to read the
new notice. <div class="bookquote">``What d'you reckon?''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Ron</b></font>) added quietly to Harry as they went
to sit down.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Well, Filch hasn't done anything about the passage into Honeydukes...''
 (<font color='red'><b>Harry/Potter/Harry Potter</b></font>)</div>Harry said, even more quietly.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Harry!''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>said a voice in his (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) right ear. Harry started and looked around
at Hermione, who was sitting at the table right behind them and clearing
a space in the wall of books that had been hiding her (<font color='blue'><b>Hermione</b></font>).

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Harry, if you go into Hogsmeade again... I'll tell Professor McGonagall
about that map!''  (<font color='red'><b>Hermione/HERMIONE</b></font>)</div>said Hermione.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Can you hear someone talking, Harry?''  (<font color='red'><b>Ron</b></font>)</div>growled Ron, not looking at
Hermione.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Ron, how can you let him (<font color='blue'><b>Ron</b></font>) go with you? After what Sirius Black nearly
did to you! I mean it, I'll tell --''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``So now you're trying to get Harry expelled!''  (<font color='red'><b>Ron</b></font>)</div>said Ron furiously.
<div class="bookquote">``Haven't you done enough damage this year?''

 (<font color='red'><b>Hermione/HERMIONE</b></font>)</div><p/>Hermione opened her (<font color='blue'><b>Hermione</b></font>) mouth to respond, but with a soft hiss, Crookshanks
leapt onto her (<font color='blue'><b>Hermione</b></font>) lap. Hermione took one frightened look at the expression
on Ron's face, gathered up Crookshanks, and hurried away toward the
girls' dormitories.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``So how about it?''  (<font color='red'><b>Ron</b></font>)</div>Ron said to Harry as though there had been no
interruption. <div class="bookquote">``Come on, last time we went you didn't see anything. You
haven't even been inside Zonko's yet!''

 (<font color='red'><b>Harry/Potter/Harry Potter</b></font>)</div><p/>Harry looked around to check that Hermione was well out of earshot.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Okay,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) said. <div class="bookquote">``But I'm taking the Invisibility Cloak this time.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Harry/Potter/Harry Potter</b></font>)</div><p/>On Saturday morning, Harry packed his (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) Invisibility Cloak in his (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) bag,
slipped the Marauder's Map into his (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) pocket, and went down to breakfast
with everyone else. Hermione kept shooting suspicious looks down the
table at him (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>), but he (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) avoided her (<font color='blue'><b>Hermione</b></font>) eye and was careful to let her (<font color='blue'><b>Hermione</b></font>) see him (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>)
walking back up the marble staircase in the entrance hall as everybody
else proceeded to the front doors.

<p/><div class="bookquote">''`Bye!''  (<font color='red'><b>everybody</b></font>)</div>Harry called to Ron. <div class="bookquote">``See you when you get back!''

 (<font color='red'><b>Ron</b></font>)</div><p/>Ron grinned and winked.

<p/>Harry hurried up to the third floor, slipping the Marauder's Map out of
his (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) pocket as he (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) went. Crouching behind the one-eyed witch, he (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) smoothed
it out. A tiny dot was moving in his (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) direction. Harry squinted at it.
The minuscule writing next to it read Neville Longbottom.

<p/>Harry quickly pulled out his (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) wand, muttered, <div class="bookquote">``Dissendium!''  (<font color='red'><b>Harry/Potter/Harry Potter</b></font>)</div>and shoved
his (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) bag into the statue, but before he (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) could climb in himself, Neville
came around the corner.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Harry! I forgot you weren't going to Hogsmeade either!''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Hi, Neville,''  (<font color='red'><b>Harry/Potter/Harry Potter</b></font>)</div>said Harry, moving swiftly away from the statue and
pushing the map back into his (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) pocket. <div class="bookquote">``What are you up to?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Nothing,''  (<font color='red'><b>Neville/Neville Longbottom/Longbottom</b></font>)</div>shrugged Neville. <div class="bookquote">``Want a game of Exploding Snap?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Er -- not now -- I was going to go to the library and do that vampire
essay for Lupin --''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I'll come with you!''  (<font color='red'><b>Neville/Neville Longbottom/Longbottom</b></font>)</div>said Neville brightly. I haven't done it either!''

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Er -- hang on -- yeah, I forgot, I finished it last night!''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Great, you can help me!''  (<font color='red'><b>Neville/Neville Longbottom/Longbottom</b></font>)</div>said Neville, his (<font color='blue'><b>Neville</b></font>) round face anxious. <div class="bookquote">``I don't
understand that thing about the garlic at all -- do they have to eat it,
or --''

 (<font color='red'><b>He</b></font>)</div><p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Neville</b></font>) broke off with a small gasp, looking over Harry's shoulder.

<p/>It was Snape. Neville took a quick step behind Harry.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``And what are you two doing here?''  (<font color='red'><b>Snape/Severus/Severus Snape</b></font>)</div>said Snape, coming to a halt and
looking from one to the other. <div class="bookquote">``An odd place to meet --''

 (<font color='red'><b>Harry/Potter/Harry Potter</b></font>)</div><p/>To Harry's immense disquiet, Snape's black eyes flicked to the doorways
on either side of them, and then to the one-eyed witch.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``We're not -- meeting here,''  (<font color='red'><b>Harry/Potter/Harry Potter</b></font>)</div>said Harry. <div class="bookquote">``We just -- met here.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Indeed?''  (<font color='red'><b>Snape/Severus/Severus Snape</b></font>)</div>said Snape. <div class="bookquote">``You have a habit of turning up in unexpected
places, Potter, and you are very rarely there for no good reason... I
suggest the pair of you return to Gryffindor Tower, where you belong.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Harry/Potter/Harry Potter</b></font>)</div><p/>Harry and Neville set off without another word. As they turned the
corner, Harry looked back. Snape was running one of his (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) hands over the
one-eyed witch's head, examining it closely.

<p/>Harry managed to shake Neville off at the Fat Lady by telling him (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) the
password, then pretending he (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>)'d left his (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) vampire essay in the library and
doubling back. Once out of sight of the security trolls, he (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) pulled out
the map again and held it close to his (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) nose.

<p/>The third floor corridor seemed to be deserted. Harry scanned the map
carefully and saw, with a leap of relief, that the tiny dot labeled
Severus Snape was now back in its office.

<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Snape</b></font>) sprinted back to the one-eyed witch, opened her (<font color='blue'><b>witch</b></font>) hump, heaved himself
inside, and slid down to meet his (<font color='blue'><b>Snape</b></font>) bag at the bottom of the stone chute.
He (<font color='blue'><b>Snape</b></font>) wiped the Marauder's Map blank again, then set off at a run.

<p/>Harry, completely hidden beneath the Invisibility Cloak, emerged into
the sunlight outside Honeydukes and prodded Ron in the back.

<p/>It's me,'' he (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) muttered.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``What kept you?''  (<font color='red'><b>Ron</b></font>)</div>Ron hissed.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Snape was hanging around.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/>They set off up the High Street.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Where are you?''  (<font color='red'><b>Ron</b></font>)</div>Ron kept muttering out of the corner of his (<font color='blue'><b>Ron</b></font>) mouth. <div class="bookquote">``Are
you still there? This feels weird...''

 (<font color='red'><b>Ron</b></font>)</div><p/>They went to the post office; Ron pretended to be checking the price of
an owl to Bill in Egypt so that Harry could have a good look around. The
owls sat hooting softly down at him (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>), at least three hundred of them;
from Great Grays right down to tiny little Scops owls -LRB-<div class="bookquote">``Local Deliveries
Only'' (<font color='red'><b>Great Grays</b></font>)</div>-RRB-, which were so small they could have sat in the palm of Harry's
hand.

<p/>Then they visited Zonko's, which was so packed with students Harry had
to exercise great care not to tread on anyone and cause a panic. There
were jokes and tricks to fulfill even Fred's and George's wildest
dreams; Harry gave Ron whispered orders and passed him (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) some gold from
under the cloak. They left Zonko's with their money bags considerably
lighter than they had been on entering, but their pockets bulging with
Dungbombs, Hiccup Sweets, Frog Spawn Soap, and a Nose-Biting Teacup
apiece.

<p/>The day was fine and breezy, and neither of them felt like staying
indoors, so they walked past the Three Broomsticks and climbed a slope
to visit the Shrieking Shack, the most haunted dwelling in Britain. It
stood a little way above the rest of the village, and even in daylight
was slightly creepy, with its boarded windows and dank overgrown garden.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Even the Hogwarts ghosts avoid it,''  (<font color='red'><b>Ron</b></font>)</div>said Ron as they leaned on the
fence, looking up at it. <div class="bookquote">``I asked Nearly Headless Nick... he (<font color='blue'><b>Nick</b></font>) says he (<font color='blue'><b>Nick</b></font>)'s
heard a very rough crowd lives here. No one can get in. Fred and George
tried, obviously, but all the entrances are sealed shut...''

 (<font color='red'><b>Harry/Potter/Harry Potter</b></font>)</div><p/>Harry, feeling hot from their climb, was just considering taking off the
cloak for a few minutes when they heard voices nearby. Someone was
climbing toward the house from the other side of the hill; moments
later, Malfoy had appeared, followed closely by Crabbe and Goyle. Malfoy
was speaking.

<p/><div class="bookquote">''... should have an owl from Father any time now. He (<font color='blue'><b>Father</b></font>) had to go to the
hearing to tell them about my arm... about how I couldn't use it for
three months...''

 (<font color='red'><b>Malfoy/Draco Malfoy/Draco</b></font>)</div><p/>Crabbe and Goyle sniggered.

<p/>``I really wish I could hear that great hairy moron trying to defend
himself... <div class="bookquote">``There's no `arm in `im, `onest that hippogriff's as good as
dead --''

 (<font color='red'><b>Malfoy</b></font>)</div><p/>Malfoy suddenly caught sight of Ron. His (<font color='blue'><b>Ron</b></font>) pale face split in a malevolent
grin.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``What are you doing, Weasley?''

 (<font color='red'><b>Malfoy/Draco Malfoy/Draco</b></font>)</div><p/>Malfoy looked up at the crumbling house behind Ron.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Suppose You'd love to live here, wouldn't you, Weasley? Dreaming about
having your own bedroom? I heard your family all sleep in one room -- is
that true?''

 (<font color='red'><b>Harry/Potter/Harry Potter</b></font>)</div><p/>Harry seized the back of Ron's robes to stop him (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) from leaping on Malfoy.
<div class="bookquote">``Leave him (<font color='blue'><b>Weasley</b></font>) to me,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Malfoy</b></font>) hissed in Ron's ear.

<p/>The opportunity was too perfect to miss. Harry crept silently around
behind Malfoy, Crabbe, and Goyle, bent down, and scooped a large handful
of mud out of the path.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``We were just discussing your friend Hagrid,''  (<font color='red'><b>Malfoy/Draco Malfoy/Draco</b></font>)</div>Malfoy said to Ron. ``Just
trying to imagine what he (<font color='blue'><b>friend</b></font>)'s saying to the Committee for the Disposal of
Dangerous Creatures. D'you think he (<font color='blue'><b>friend</b></font>)'ll cry when they cut off his (<font color='blue'><b>friend</b></font>)
hippogriff's

<p/>SPLAT.

<p/>Malfoy's head jerked forward as the mud hit him (<font color='blue'><b>Malfoy</b></font>); his (<font color='blue'><b>Malfoy</b></font>) silverblond hair
was suddenly dripping in muck.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``What the --?''

 (<font color='red'><b>Ron</b></font>)</div><p/>Ron had to hold onto the fence to keep himself standing, he (<font color='blue'><b>Ron</b></font>) was laughing
so hard. Malfoy, Crabbe, and Goyle spun stupidly on the spot, staring
wildly around, Malfoy trying to wipe his (<font color='blue'><b>Malfoy</b></font>) hair clean.

<p/>``What was that? <div class="bookquote">``Who did that?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Very haunted up here, isn't it?''  (<font color='red'><b>Ron</b></font>)</div>said Ron, with the air of one
commenting on the weather.

<p/>Crabbe and Goyle were looking scared. Their bulging muscles were no use
against ghosts. Malfoy was staring madly around at the deserted
landscape.

<p/>Harry sneaked along the path, where a particularly sloppy puddle yielded
some foul-smelling, green sludge.

<p/>SPLATTER.

<p/>Crabbe and Goyle caught some this time. Goyle hopped furiously on the
spot, trying to rub it out of his (<font color='blue'><b>Crabbe</b></font>) small, dull eyes.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``It came from over there!''  (<font color='red'><b>Malfoy/Draco Malfoy/Draco</b></font>)</div>said Malfoy, wiping his (<font color='blue'><b>Malfoy</b></font>) face, and staring at
a spot some six feet to the left of Harry.

<p/>Crabbe blundered forward, his (<font color='blue'><b>Crabbe</b></font>) long arms outstretched like a zombie.
Harry dodged around him (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>), picked up a stick, and lobbed it at Crabbe's
back. Harry doubled up with silent laughter as Crabbe did a kind of
pirouette in midair, trying to see who had thrown it. As Ron was the
only person Crabbe could see, it was Ron he (<font color='blue'><b>Ron</b></font>) started toward, but Harry
stuck out his (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) leg. Crabbe stumbled -- and his (<font color='blue'><b>Crabbe</b></font>) huge, flat foot caught the
hem of Harry's cloak. Harry felt a great tug, then the cloak slid off
his (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) face.

<p/>For a split second, Malfoy stared at him (<font color='blue'><b>Malfoy</b></font>).

<p/><div class="bookquote">``AAARGH!''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Malfoy</b></font>) yelled, pointing at Harry's head. Then he (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) turned tail and
ran, at breakneck speed, back down the hill, Crabbe and Goyle behind
him (<font color='blue'><b>Crabbe</b></font>).

<p/>Harry tugged the cloak up again, but the damage was done.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Harry!''  (<font color='red'><b>Ron</b></font>)</div>Ron said, stumbling forward and staring hopelessly at the point
where Harry had disappeared, <div class="bookquote">``you'd better run for it! If Malfoy tells
anyone -- you'd better get back to the castle, quick --''  (<font color='red'><b>Harry/Potter/Harry Potter</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``See you
later,''  (<font color='red'><b>Harry/Potter/Harry Potter</b></font>)</div>said Harry, and without another word, he (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) tore back down the path
toward Hogsmeade.

<p/>Would Malfoy believe what he (<font color='blue'><b>Malfoy</b></font>) had seen? Would anyone believe

<p/>Malfoy? Nobody knew about the Invisibility Cloak -- nobody except
Dumbledore. Harry's stomach turned over -- Dumbledore would know exactly
what had happened, if Malfoy said any- thing --

<p/>Back into Honeydukes, back down the cellar steps, across the stone
floor, through the trapdoor -- Harry pulled off the cloak, tucked it
under his (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) arm, and ran, flat out, along the passage... Malfoy would get
back first... how long would it take him (<font color='blue'><b>Malfoy</b></font>) to find a teacher? Panting, a
sharp pain in his (<font color='blue'><b>Malfoy</b></font>) side, Harry didn't slow down until he (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) reached the
stone slide. He (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) would have to leave the cloak where it was, it was too
much of a giveaway in case Malfoy had tipped off a teacher -- he (<font color='blue'><b>Malfoy</b></font>) hid it
in a shadowy corner, then started to climb, fast as he (<font color='blue'><b>Malfoy</b></font>) could, his (<font color='blue'><b>Malfoy</b></font>) sweaty
hands slipping on the sides of the chute. He (<font color='blue'><b>Malfoy</b></font>) reached the inside of the
witch's hump, tapped it with his (<font color='blue'><b>Malfoy</b></font>) wand, stuck his (<font color='blue'><b>Malfoy</b></font>) head through, and
hoisted himself out; the hump closed, and just as Harry jumped out from
behind the statue, he (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) heard quick footsteps approaching.

<p/>It was Snape. He (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) approached Harry at a swift walk, his (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) black robes
swishing, then stopped in front of him (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>).

<p/><div class="bookquote">``So,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) said.

<p/>There was a look of surpressed triumph about him (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>). Harry tried to look
innocent, all too aware of his (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) sweaty face and his (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) muddy hands, which he (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>)
quickly hid in his (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) pockets.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Come with me, Potter,''  (<font color='red'><b>Snape/Severus/Severus Snape</b></font>)</div>said Snape.

<p/>Harry followed him (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) downstairs, trying to wipe his (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) hands clean on the
inside of his (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) robes without Snape noticing. They walked down the stairs
to the dungeons and then into Snape's office.

<p/>Harry had been in here only once before, and he (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) had been in very serious
trouble then too. Snape had aquired a few more slimy horrible things in
jars since last time, all standing on shelves behind his (<font color='blue'><b>Snape</b></font>) desk, glinting
in the firelight and adding to the threatening atmosphere.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Sit,''  (<font color='red'><b>Snape/Severus/Severus Snape</b></font>)</div>said Snape.

<p/>Harry sat. Snape, however, remained, standing.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Mr. Malfoy has just been to see me with a strange story, Potter,''  (<font color='red'><b>Snape/Severus/Severus Snape</b></font>)</div>said
Snape.

<p/>Harry didn't say anything.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``He (<font color='blue'><b>Malfoy</b></font>) tells me that he (<font color='blue'><b>Malfoy</b></font>) was up by the Shrieking Shack when he (<font color='blue'><b>Malfoy</b></font>) ran into
Weasley -- apparently alone.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Harry/Potter/Harry Potter</b></font>)</div><p/>Still, Harry didn't speak.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Mr. Malfoy states that he (<font color='blue'><b>Malfoy</b></font>) was standing talking to Weasley, when a large
amount of mud hit him (<font color='blue'><b>Malfoy</b></font>) in the back of the head. How do you think that
could have happened?''

 (<font color='red'><b>Harry/Potter/Harry Potter</b></font>)</div><p/>Harry tried to look mildly surprised.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``I don't know, Professor.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Snape/Severus/Severus Snape</b></font>)</div><p/>Snape's eyes were boring into Harry's. It was exactly like trying to
stare down a hippogriff. Harry tried hard not to blink.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Mr. Malfoy then saw an extraordinary apparition. Can you imagine what
it might have been, Potter?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``No,''  (<font color='red'><b>Harry/Potter/Harry Potter</b></font>)</div>said Harry, now trying to sound innocently curious.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``It was your head, Potter. Floating in midair.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/>There was a long silence.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Maybe he (<font color='blue'><b>Potter</b></font>)'d better go to Madam Pomfrey,''  (<font color='red'><b>Harry/Potter/Harry Potter</b></font>)</div>said Harry. <div class="bookquote">``If he (<font color='blue'><b>Potter</b></font>)'s seeing
things like --''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``What would your head have been doing in Hogsmeade, Potter?''  (<font color='red'><b>Snape/Severus/Severus Snape</b></font>)</div>said Snape
softly. <div class="bookquote">``Your head is not allowed in Hogsmeade. No part of your body has
permission to be in Hogsmeade.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I know that,''  (<font color='red'><b>Harry/Potter/Harry Potter</b></font>)</div>said Harry, striving to keep his (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) face free of guilt or
fear. <div class="bookquote">``It sounds like Malfoy's having hallucin --''

 (<font color='red'><b>Snape/Severus/Severus Snape</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Malfoy is not having hallucinations,''  (<font color='red'><b>Snape/Severus/Severus Snape</b></font>)</div>snarled Snape, and he (<font color='blue'><b>Snape</b></font>) bent down,
a hand on each arm of Harry's chair, so that their faces were a foot
apart. <div class="bookquote">``If your head was in Hogsmeade, so was the rest of you.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I've been up in Gryffindor Tower,''  (<font color='red'><b>Harry/Potter/Harry Potter</b></font>)</div>said Harry. <div class="bookquote">``Like you told --''  (<font color='red'><b>Harry/Potter/Harry Potter</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``Can
anyone confirm that?''

 (<font color='red'><b>Harry/Potter/Harry Potter</b></font>)</div><p/>Harry didn't say anything. Snape's thin mouth curled into a horrible
smile.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``So,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) said, straightening up again. ``Everyone from the Minister of
Magic downward has been trying to keep famous Harry Potter safe from
Sirius Black. But famous Harry Potter is a law unto himself Let the
ordinary people worry about his (<font color='blue'><b>Potter</b></font>) safety! Famous Harry Potter goes where
he (<font color='blue'><b>Potter</b></font>) wants to, with no thought for the consequences.

<p/>Harry stayed silent. Snape was trying to provoke him (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) into telling the
truth. He (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) wasn't going to do it. Snape had no proof -- yet.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``How extraordinarily like your father you are, Potter,''  (<font color='red'><b>Snape/Severus/Severus Snape</b></font>)</div>Snape said
suddenly, his (<font color='blue'><b>Snape</b></font>) eyes glinting. <div class="bookquote">``He (<font color='blue'><b>Potter</b></font>) too was exceedingly arrogant. A small
amount of talent on the Quidditch field made him (<font color='blue'><b>Potter</b></font>) think he (<font color='blue'><b>Potter</b></font>) was a cut
above the rest of us too. Strutting around the place with his (<font color='blue'><b>Potter</b></font>) friends
and admirers... The resemblance between you is uncanny.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``My dad didn't strut,''  (<font color='red'><b>Harry/Potter/Harry Potter</b></font>)</div>said Harry, before he (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) could stop himself. <div class="bookquote">``And
neither do I.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Snape/Severus/Severus Snape</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Your father didn't set much store by rules either,''  (<font color='red'><b>Snape/Severus/Severus Snape</b></font>)</div>Snape went on,
pressing his (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) advantage, his (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) thin face full of malice. <div class="bookquote">``Rules were for
lesser mortals, not Quidditch Cup-winners. His (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) head was so swollen --''

 (<font color='red'><b>Harry/Potter/Harry Potter</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``SHUT UP!''

 (<font color='red'><b>Harry/Potter/Harry Potter</b></font>)</div><p/>Harry was suddenly on his (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) feet. Rage such as he (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) had not felt since his (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>)
last night in Privet Drive was coursing through him (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>). He (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) didn't care that
Snape's face had gone rigid, the black eyes flashing dangerously.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``What did you say to me, Potter?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I told you to shut up about my dad!''  (<font color='red'><b>Harry/Potter/Harry Potter</b></font>)</div>Harry yelled. I know the truth,
all right? He (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) saved your life! Dumbledore told me! You wouldn't even be
here if it wasn't for my dad!''

<p/>Snape's sallow skin had gone the color of sour milk.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``And did the headmaster tell you the circumstances in which your father
saved my life?''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Snape</b></font>) whispered. <div class="bookquote">``Or did he (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) consider the details too
unpleasant for precious Potter's delicate ears?''

 (<font color='red'><b>Harry/Potter/Harry Potter</b></font>)</div><p/>Harry bit his (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) lip. He (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) didn't know what had happened and didn't want to
admit it -- but Snape seemed to have guessed the truth.

<p/>I would hate for you to run away with a false idea of your father,
Potter,'' he (<font color='blue'><b>Potter</b></font>) said, a terrible grin twisting his (<font color='blue'><b>Potter</b></font>) face. <div class="bookquote">``Have you been
imagining some act of glorious heroism? Then let me correct you -- your
saintly father and his (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) friends played a highly amusing joke on me that
would have resulted in my death if your father hadn't got cold feet at
the last moment. There was nothing brave about what he (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) did. He (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) was
saving his (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) own skin as much as mine. Had their joke succeeded, he (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) would
have been expelled from Hogwarts.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Snape/Severus/Severus Snape</b></font>)</div><p/>Snape's uneven, yellowish teeth were bared.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Turn out your pockets, Potter!''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Snape</b></font>) spat suddenly.

<p/>Harry didn't move. There was a pounding in his (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) ears.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Turn out your pockets, or we go straight to the headmaster! Pull them
out, Potter!''

 (<font color='red'><b>Harry/Potter/Harry Potter</b></font>)</div><p/>Cold with dread, Harry slowly pulled out the bag of Zonko's tricks and
the Marauder's Map.

<p/>Snap picked up the Zonko's bag.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Ron gave them to me,''  (<font color='red'><b>Harry/Potter/Harry Potter</b></font>)</div>said Harry, praying he (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>)'d get a chance to tip Ron
off before Snape saw him (<font color='blue'><b>Snape</b></font>). <div class="bookquote">``He (<font color='blue'><b>Ron</b></font>) -brought them back from Hogsmeade last
time --''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Indeed? And you've been carrying them around ever since? How very
touching... and what is this?''

 (<font color='red'><b>Snape/Severus/Severus Snape</b></font>)</div><p/>Snape had picked up the map. Harry tried with all his (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) might to keep his (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>)
face impassive.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Spare bit of parchment,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) said with a shrug.

<p/>Snape turned it over, his (<font color='blue'><b>Snape</b></font>) eyes on Harry.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Surely you don't need such a very old piece of parchment?''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) said.
<div class="bookquote">``Why don't I just -- throw this away?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/>His (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) hand moved toward the fire.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``No!''  (<font color='red'><b>Harry/Potter/Harry Potter</b></font>)</div>Harry said quickly.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``So!''  (<font color='red'><b>Snape/Severus/Severus Snape</b></font>)</div>said Snape, his (<font color='blue'><b>Snape</b></font>) long nostrils quivering. <div class="bookquote">``Is this another
treasured gift from Mr. Weasley? Or is it -- something else? A letter,
perhaps, written in invisible ink? Or -- instructions to get into
Hogsmeade without passing the dementors?''

 (<font color='red'><b>Harry/Potter/Harry Potter</b></font>)</div><p/>Harry blinked. Snape's eyes gleamed.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Let me see, let me see...''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) muttered, taking out his (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) wand and
smoothing the map out on his (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) desk. <div class="bookquote">``Reveal your secret!''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) said,
touching the wand to the parchment.

<p/>Nothing happened. Harry clenched his (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) hands to stop them from shaking.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Show yourself!''  (<font color='red'><b>Snape/Severus/Severus Snape</b></font>)</div>Snape said, tapping the map sharply.

<p/>It stayed blank. Harry was taking deep, calming breaths.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Professor Severus Snape, master of this school, commands you to yield
the information you conceal!''  (<font color='red'><b>Snape/Severus/Severus Snape</b></font>)</div>Snape said, hitting the map with his (<font color='blue'><b>Snape</b></font>) wand.

<p/>As though an invisible hand were writing upon it, words appeared on the
smooth surface of the map.

<p/>Mooney presents his (<font color='blue'><b>Mooney</b></font>) compliments to Professor Snape, and begs him (<font color='blue'><b>Snape</b></font>) to keep
his (<font color='blue'><b>Snape</b></font>) abnormally large nose out of other people's business.''

<p/>Snape froze. Harry stared, dumbstruck, at the message. But the map
didn't stop there. More writing was appearing beneath the first.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Mr. Prongs agrees with Mr. Moony and would like to add that Professor
Snape is an ugle git.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/>It would have been very funny if the situation hadn't been so serious.
And there was more...

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Mr. Padfoot would like to register his (<font color='blue'><b>Snape</b></font>) astonishment that an idiot like
that ever became a professor.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Harry/Potter/Harry Potter</b></font>)</div><p/>Harry closed his (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) eyes in horror. When he (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>)'d opened them, the map had had
its last word.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Mr. Wormtail bids Professor Snape good day, and advises him (<font color='blue'><b>Snape</b></font>) to wash his (<font color='blue'><b>Snape</b></font>)
hair , the slimeball.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Harry/Potter/Harry Potter</b></font>)</div><p/>Harry waited for the blow to fall.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``So...''  (<font color='red'><b>Snape/Severus/Severus Snape</b></font>)</div>said Snape softly. <div class="bookquote">``We'll see about this...''

 (<font color='red'><b>He</b></font>)</div><p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Snape</b></font>) strode across to his (<font color='blue'><b>Snape</b></font>) fire, seized a fistful of glittering powder from
a jar on the fireplace, and threw it into the flames.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Lupin!''  (<font color='red'><b>Snape/Severus/Severus Snape</b></font>)</div>Snape called into the fire. <div class="bookquote">``I want a word!''

 (<font color='red'><b>Harry/Potter/Harry Potter</b></font>)</div><p/>Utterly bewildered, Harry stared at the fire. A large shape had appeared
in it, revolving very fast. Seconds later, Professor Lupin was
clambering out of the fireplace, brushing ash off his (<font color='blue'><b>Professor</b></font>) shabby robes.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``You called, Severus?''  (<font color='red'><b>Lupin</b></font>)</div>said Lupin mildly.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``I certainly did,''  (<font color='red'><b>Snape/Severus/Severus Snape</b></font>)</div>said Snape, his (<font color='blue'><b>Snape</b></font>) face contorted with fury as he (<font color='blue'><b>Snape</b></font>) strode
back to his (<font color='blue'><b>Snape</b></font>) desk. <div class="bookquote">``I have just asked Potter to empty his (<font color='blue'><b>Potter</b></font>) pockets. He (<font color='blue'><b>Potter</b></font>) was
carrying this.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Snape/Severus/Severus Snape</b></font>)</div><p/>Snape pointed at the parchment, on which the words of Messrs. Moony,
Wormtail, Padfoot, and Prongs were still shining. An odd, closed
expression appeared on Lupin's face.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Well?''  (<font color='red'><b>Snape/Severus/Severus Snape</b></font>)</div>said Snape.

<p/>Lupin continued to stare at the map. Harry had the impression that Lupin
was doing some very quick thinking.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Well?''  (<font color='red'><b>Snape/Severus/Severus Snape</b></font>)</div>said Snape again. <div class="bookquote">``This parchment is plainly full of Dark Magic.
This is supposed to be your area of expertise, Lupin. Where do you
imagine Potter got such a thing?''

 (<font color='red'><b>Lupin</b></font>)</div><p/>Lupin looked up and, by the merest half-glance in Harry's direction,
warned him (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) not to interrupt.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Full of Dark Magic?''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) repeated mildly. <div class="bookquote">``Do you really think so,
Severus? It looks to me as though it is merely a piece of parchment that
insults anybody who reads it. Childish, but surely not dangerous? I
imagine Harry got it from a joke shop --''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Indeed?''  (<font color='red'><b>Snape/Severus/Severus Snape</b></font>)</div>said Snape. His (<font color='blue'><b>Snape</b></font>) jaw had gone rigid with anger. <div class="bookquote">``You think a
joke shop could supply him (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) with such a thing? You don't think it more
likely that he (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) got it directly from the manufacturers?''

 (<font color='red'><b>Harry/Potter/Harry Potter</b></font>)</div><p/>Harry didn't understand what Snape was talking about. Nor, apparently,
did Lupin.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``You mean, by Mr. Wormtail or one of these people?''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Snape</b></font>) said. <div class="bookquote">``Harry, do
you know any of these men?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``No,''  (<font color='red'><b>Harry/Potter/Harry Potter</b></font>)</div>said Harry quickly.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``You see, Severus?''  (<font color='red'><b>Lupin/R. J. Lupin</b></font>)</div>said Lupin, turning back to Snape. <div class="bookquote">``It looks like a
Zonko product to me --''

 (<font color='red'><b>Ron</b></font>)</div><p/>Right on cue, Ron came bursting into the office. He (<font color='blue'><b>Snape</b></font>) was completely out
of breath, and stopped just short of Snape's desk, clutching the stitch
in his (<font color='blue'><b>Snape</b></font>) chest and trying to speak.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``I -- gave -- Harry -- that -- stuff,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Snape</b></font>) choked. <div class="bookquote">``Bought -- it... in
Zonko's... ages -- ago...''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Well!''  (<font color='red'><b>Lupin/R. J. Lupin</b></font>)</div>said Lupin, clapping his (<font color='blue'><b>Snape</b></font>) hands together and looking around
cheerfully. <div class="bookquote">``That seems to clear that up! Severus, I'll take this back,
shall I?''  (<font color='red'><b>He</b></font>)</div>He (<font color='blue'><b>Snape</b></font>) folded the map and tucked it inside his (<font color='blue'><b>Snape</b></font>) robes. <div class="bookquote">``Harry, Ron,
come with me, I need a word about my vampire essay -- excuse us, Severus
--''

 (<font color='red'><b>Harry/Potter/Harry Potter</b></font>)</div><p/>Harry didn't dare look at Snape as they left his (<font color='blue'><b>Snape</b></font>) office. He (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>). Ron, and
Lupin walked all the way back into the entrance hall before speaking.
Then Harry turned to Lupin.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Professor, I --''

 (<font color='red'><b>Lupin</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I don't want to hear explanations,''  (<font color='red'><b>Lupin</b></font>)</div>said Lupin shortly. He (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) glanced
around the empty entrance hall and lowered his (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) voice. <div class="bookquote">``I happen to know
that this map was confiscated by Mr. Filch many years ago. Yes, I know
it' s a map,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) said as Harry and Ron looked amazed. <div class="bookquote">``I don't want to
know how it fell into your possession. I am, however, astounded that you
didn't hand it in. Particularly after what happened the last time a
student left information about the castle lying around. And I can't let
you have it back, Harry.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Harry/Potter/Harry Potter</b></font>)</div><p/>Harry had expected that, and was too keen for explanations to protest.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Why did Snape think I'd got it from the manufacturers?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Because...,''  (<font color='red'><b>Lupin</b></font>)</div>Lupin hesitated, <div class="bookquote">``because these mapmakers would have
wanted to lure you out of school. They'd think it extremely
entertaining.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Lupin</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Do you know them?''  (<font color='red'><b>Harry/Potter/Harry Potter</b></font>)</div>said Harry, impressed.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``We've met,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) said shortly. He (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) was looking at Harry more seriously
than ever before.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Don't expect me to cover up for you again, Harry. I cannot make you
take Sirius Black seriously. But I would have thought that what you have
heard when the dementors draw near you would have had more of an effect
on you. Your parents gave their lives to keep you alive, Harry. A poor
way to repay them -- gambling their sacrifice for a bag of magic
tricks.''

 (<font color='red'><b>He</b></font>)</div><p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) walked away, leaving Harry feeling worse by far than he (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) had at any
point in Snape's office. Slowly, he (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) and Ron mounted the marble
staircase. As Harry passed the one-eyed witch, he (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) remembered the
Invisibility Cloak -- it was still down there, but he (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) didn't dare go and
get it.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``It's my fault,''  (<font color='red'><b>Ron</b></font>)</div>said Ron abruptly. <div class="bookquote">``I persuaded you to go. Lupin's
right, it was stupid, we shouldn't've done it --''

 (<font color='red'><b>He</b></font>)</div><p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Ron</b></font>) broke off; they reached the corridor where the security trolls were
pacing, and Hermione was walking toward them. One look at her (<font color='blue'><b>Hermione</b></font>) face
convinced Harry that she (<font color='blue'><b>Hermione</b></font>) had heard what had happened. His (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) heart
plummeted -- had she (<font color='blue'><b>Hermione</b></font>) told Professor McGonagall?

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Come to have a good gloat?''  (<font color='red'><b>Ron</b></font>)</div>said Ron savagely as she (<font color='blue'><b>Hermione</b></font>) stopped in front
of them. <div class="bookquote">``Or have you just been to tell on us?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``No,''  (<font color='red'><b>Hermione/HERMIONE</b></font>)</div>said Hermione. She (<font color='blue'><b>Hermione</b></font>) was holding a letter in her (<font color='blue'><b>Hermione</b></font>) hands and her (<font color='blue'><b>Hermione</b></font>) lip
was trembling. <div class="bookquote">``I just thought you ought to know... Hagrid lost his (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>)
case. Buckbeak is going to be executed.''

 (<font color='red'><b>He</b></font>)</div><p/>CHAPTER FIFTEEN

<p/>THE QUIDDITCH FINAL

<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>lip</b></font>) sent me this,'' Hermione said, holding out the letter.

<p/>Harry took it. The parchment was damp, and enormous teardrops had
smudged the ink so badly in places that it was very difficult to read.

<p/>Dear Hermione, We lost. I'm allowed to bring him (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) back to Hogwarts.
Execution date to be fixed. Beaky has enjoyed London. I won't forget all
the help you gave us.

<p/>Hagrid

<p/><div class="bookquote">``They can't do this,''  (<font color='red'><b>Hagrid</b></font>)</div>said Harry. <div class="bookquote">``They can't. Buckbeak isn't
dangerous.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Malfoy's dad's frightened the Committee into it,''  (<font color='red'><b>Hermione/HERMIONE</b></font>)</div>said Hermione, wiping
her (<font color='blue'><b>Hermione</b></font>) eyes. <div class="bookquote">``You know what he (<font color='blue'><b>dad</b></font>)'s like. They're a bunch of doddery old
fools, and they were scared. There'll be an appeal, though, there always
is. Only I can't see any hope... Nothing will have changed.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Yeah, it will,''  (<font color='red'><b>Ron</b></font>)</div>said Ron fiercely. <div class="bookquote">``You won't have to do all the work
alone this time, Hermione. I'll help.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Oh, Ron!''

 (<font color='red'><b>Hermione/HERMIONE</b></font>)</div><p/>Hermione flung her (<font color='blue'><b>Hermione</b></font>) arms around Ron's neck and broke down completely.
Ron, looking quite terrified, patted her (<font color='blue'><b>Hermione</b></font>) very awkwardly on the top of
the head. Finally, Hermione drew away.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Ron, I'm really, really sorry about Scabbers...''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Hermione</b></font>) sobbed.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Oh -- well -- he (<font color='blue'><b>Ron</b></font>) was old,''  (<font color='red'><b>Ron</b></font>)</div>said Ron, looking thoroughly relieved that
she (<font color='blue'><b>Hermione</b></font>) had let go of him (<font color='blue'><b>Ron</b></font>). <div class="bookquote">``And he (<font color='blue'><b>Ron</b></font>) was a bit useless. You never know, Mum
and Dad might get me an owl now.''

 (<font color='red'><b>the students</b></font>)</div><p/>The safety measures imposed on the students since Black's second
break-in made it impossible for Harry, Ron, and Hermione to go and visit
Hagrid in the evenings. Their only chance of talking to him (<font color='blue'><b>Ron</b></font>) was during
Care of Magical Creatures lessons.

<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Ron</b></font>) seemed numb with shock at the verdict.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``S'all my fault. Got all tongue-tied. They was all sittin' there in
black robes an' I kep' droppin' me notes and forgettin' all them dates
yeh looked up fer me, Hermione. An' then Lucius Malfoy stood up an' said
his (<font color='blue'><b>Malfoy</b></font>) bit, and the Committee jus' did exac`ly what he (<font color='blue'><b>Malfoy</b></font>) told 'em...''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``There's still the appeal!''  (<font color='red'><b>Ron</b></font>)</div>said Ron fiercely. <div class="bookquote">``Don't give up Yet, we're
working on it!''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/>They were walking back up to the castle with the rest of the class.
Ahead they could see Malfoy, who was walking with Crabbe and Goyle, and
kept looking back, laughing derisively.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``S'no good, Ron,''  (<font color='red'><b>Hagrid</b></font>)</div>said Hagrid sadly as they reached the castle steps.
<div class="bookquote">``That Committee's in Lucius Malfoy's pocket. I'm jus' gonna make sure
the rest o' Beaky's time is the happiest he (<font color='blue'><b>Ron</b></font>)'s ever had. I owe him (<font color='blue'><b>Ron</b></font>)
that...''

 (<font color='red'><b>Hagrid</b></font>)</div><p/>Hagrid turned around and hurried back toward his (<font color='blue'><b>Crabbe</b></font>) cabin, his (<font color='blue'><b>Crabbe</b></font>) face buried
in his (<font color='blue'><b>Crabbe</b></font>) handkerchief.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Look at him (<font color='blue'><b>Ron</b></font>) blubber!''

 (<font color='red'><b>Malfoy/Draco Malfoy/Draco</b></font>)</div><p/>Malfoy, Crabbe, and Goyle had been standing just inside the castle
doors, listening.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Have you ever seen anything quite as pathetic?''  (<font color='red'><b>Malfoy/Draco Malfoy/Draco</b></font>)</div>said Malfoy. <div class="bookquote">``And he (<font color='blue'><b>Ron</b></font>)'s
supposed to be our teacher!''

 (<font color='red'><b>Harry/Potter/Harry Potter</b></font>)</div><p/>Harry and Ron both made furious moves toward Malfoy, but Hermione got
there first -- SMACK!

<p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>Hermione</b></font>) had slapped Malfoy across the face with all the strength she (<font color='blue'><b>Hermione</b></font>) could
muster. Malfoy staggered. Harry, Ron, Crabbe, and Goyle stood
flabbergasted as Hermione raised her (<font color='blue'><b>Hermione</b></font>) hand again.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Don't you dare call Hagrid pathetic, you foul -- you evil --''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Hermione!''  (<font color='red'><b>Ron</b></font>)</div>said Ron weakly, and he (<font color='blue'><b>Ron</b></font>) tried to grab her (<font color='blue'><b>Hermione</b></font>) hand as she (<font color='blue'><b>Hermione</b></font>) swung
it back.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Get off, Ron!''

 (<font color='red'><b>Hermione/HERMIONE</b></font>)</div><p/>Hermione pulled out her (<font color='blue'><b>Hermione</b></font>) wand. Malfoy stepped backward. Crabbe and Goyle
looked at him (<font color='blue'><b>Malfoy</b></font>) for instructions, thoroughly bewildered.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``C'mon,''  (<font color='red'><b>Malfoy/Draco Malfoy/Draco</b></font>)</div>Malfoy muttered, and in a moment, all three of them had
disappeared into the passageway to the dungeons.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Hermione!''  (<font color='red'><b>Ron</b></font>)</div>Ron said again, sounding both stunned and irnpressed.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Harry, you'd better beat him (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) in the Quidditch final!''  (<font color='red'><b>Hermione/HERMIONE</b></font>)</div>Hermione said
shrilly. <div class="bookquote">``You just better had, because I can't stand it if Slytherin
wins!''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``We're due in Charms,''  (<font color='red'><b>Ron</b></font>)</div>said Ron, still goggling at Hermione. <div class="bookquote">``We'd
better go.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Professor</b></font>)</div><p/>They hurried up the marble staircase toward Professor Flitwick's
classroom.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``You're late, boys!''  (<font color='red'><b>Professor</b></font>)</div>said Professor Flitwick reprovingly as Harry opened
the classroom door. <div class="bookquote">``Come along, quickly, wands out, we're experimenting
with Cheering Charms today, we've already divided into pairs --''

 (<font color='red'><b>Harry/Potter/Harry Potter</b></font>)</div><p/>Harry and Ron hurried to a desk at the back and opened their bags. Ron
looked behind him (<font color='blue'><b>Ron</b></font>).

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Where's Hermione gone?''

 (<font color='red'><b>Harry/Potter/Harry Potter</b></font>)</div><p/>Harry looked around too. Hermione hadn't entered the classroom, yet
Harry knew she (<font color='blue'><b>Hermione</b></font>) had been right next to him (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) when he (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) had opened the door.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``That's weird,''  (<font color='red'><b>Harry/Potter/Harry Potter</b></font>)</div>said Harry, staring at Ron. <div class="bookquote">``Maybe -- maybe she (<font color='blue'><b>Hermione</b></font>) went to
the bathroom or something?''

 (<font color='red'><b>Hermione/HERMIONE</b></font>)</div><p/>But Hermione didn't turn up all lesson.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``She (<font color='blue'><b>Hermione</b></font>) could've done with a Cheering Charm on her (<font color='blue'><b>Hermione</b></font>) too,''  (<font color='red'><b>Ron</b></font>)</div>said Ron as the
class left for lunch, all grinning broadly -- the Cheering Charms had
left them with a feeling of great contentment.

<p/>Hermione wasn't at lunch either. By the time they had finished their
apple pie, the after-effects of the Cheering Charms were wearing off,
and Harry and Ron had started to get slightly worried.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``You don't think Malfoy did something to her (<font color='blue'><b>Hermione</b></font>)?''  (<font color='red'><b>Ron</b></font>)</div>Ron said anxiously as
they hurried upstairs toward Gryffindor Tower.

<p/>They passed the security trolls, gave the Fat Lady the password
-LRB-<div class="bookquote">``Flibbertigibbet'' (<font color='red'><b>the Fat Lady</b></font>)</div>-RRB-, and scrambled through the portrait hole into the
common room.

<p/>Hermione was sitting at a table, fast asleep, her (<font color='blue'><b>Hermione</b></font>) head resting on an
open Arithmancy book. They went to sit down on either side of her (<font color='blue'><b>Hermione</b></font>). Harry
prodded her (<font color='blue'><b>Hermione</b></font>) awake.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Wh -- what?''  (<font color='red'><b>Hermione/HERMIONE</b></font>)</div>said Hermione, waking with a start and staring wildly
around. <div class="bookquote">``Is it time to go? W -- which lesson have we got now?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Divination, but it's not for another twenty minutes,''  (<font color='red'><b>Harry/Potter/Harry Potter</b></font>)</div>said Harry.
<div class="bookquote">``Hermione, why didn't you come to Charms?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``What? Oh no!''  (<font color='red'><b>Hermione/HERMIONE</b></font>)</div>Hermione squeaked. <div class="bookquote">``I forgot to go to Charms!''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``But how could you forget?''  (<font color='red'><b>Harry/Potter/Harry Potter</b></font>)</div>said Harry. <div class="bookquote">``You were with us till we were
right outside the classroom!''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I don't believe it!''  (<font color='red'><b>Hermione/HERMIONE</b></font>)</div>Hermione wailed. <div class="bookquote">``Was Professor Flitwick angry?
Oh, it was Malfoy, I was thinking about him (<font color='blue'><b>Malfoy</b></font>) and I lost track of things!''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``You know what, Hermione?''  (<font color='red'><b>Ron</b></font>)</div>said Ron, looking down at the enormous
Arithmancy book Hermione had been using as a pillow. <div class="bookquote">``I reckon you're
cracking up. You're trying to do too much.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``No, I'm not!''  (<font color='red'><b>Hermione/HERMIONE</b></font>)</div>said Hermione, brushing her (<font color='blue'><b>Hermione</b></font>) hair out of her (<font color='blue'><b>Hermione</b></font>) eyes and
staring hopelessly around for her (<font color='blue'><b>Hermione</b></font>) bag. <div class="bookquote">``I just made a mistake, that's
all! I'd better go and see Professor Flitwick and say sorry... I'll see
you in Divination!''

 (<font color='red'><b>Hermione/HERMIONE</b></font>)</div><p/>Hermione joined them at the foot of the ladder to Professor Trelawneys
classroom twenty minutes later, looking extremely harrassed.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``I can't believe I missed Cheering Charms! And I bet they come up in our
exams; Professor Flitwick hinted they might!''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/>Together they climbed the ladder into the dim, stifling tower room.
Glowing on every little table was a crystal ball full of pearly white
mist. Harry, Ron, and Hermione sat down together at the same rickety
table.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``I thought we weren't starting crystal balls until next term,''  (<font color='red'><b>Ron</b></font>)</div>Ron
muttered, casting a wary eye around for Professor Trelawney, in case she (<font color='blue'><b>Hermione</b></font>)
was lurking nearby.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Don't complain, this means we've finished palmistry,''  (<font color='red'><b>Harry/Potter/Harry Potter</b></font>)</div>Harry muttered
back. <div class="bookquote">``I was getting sick of her (<font color='blue'><b>I</b></font>) flinching every time she (<font color='blue'><b>I</b></font>) looked at my
hands.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Good day to you!''  (<font color='red'><b>Professor</b></font>)</div>said the familiar, misty voice, and Professor
Trelawney made her (<font color='blue'><b>Hermione</b></font>) usual dramatic entrance out of the shadows. Parvati
and Lavender quivered with excitement, their faces lit by the milky glow
of their crystal ball.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``I have decided to introduce the crystal ball a little earlier than I
had planned,''  (<font color='red'><b>Professor</b></font>)</div>said Professor Trelawney, sitting with her (<font color='blue'><b>Parvati</b></font>) back to the
fire and gazing around. <div class="bookquote">``The fates have informed me that your
examination in June will concern the Orb, and I am anxious to give you
sufficient practice.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Hermione/HERMIONE</b></font>)</div><p/>Hermione snorted.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Well, honestly... `the fates have informed her (<font color='blue'><b>I</b></font>)' who sets the exam? She (<font color='blue'><b>I</b></font>)
does! What an amazing prediction!''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Hermione</b></font>) said, not troubling to keep her (<font color='blue'><b>Hermione</b></font>)
voice low. Harry and Ron choked back laughs.

<p/>It was hard to tell whether Professor Trelawney had heard them as her (<font color='blue'><b>Hermione</b></font>)
face was hidden in shadow. She (<font color='blue'><b>Hermione</b></font>) continued, however, as though she (<font color='blue'><b>Hermione</b></font>) had
not.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Crystal gazing is a particularly refined art,''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Hermione</b></font>) said dreamily. <div class="bookquote">``I do
not expect any of you to See when first you peer into the Orb's infinite
depths. We shall start by practicing relaxing the conscious mind and
external eyes''  (<font color='red'><b>Ron</b></font>)</div>-- Ron began to snigger uncontrollably and had to stuff
his (<font color='blue'><b>Ron</b></font>) fist in his (<font color='blue'><b>Ron</b></font>) mouth to stifle the noise -- <div class="bookquote">``so as to clear the Inner
Eye and the superconscious. Perhaps, if we are lucky, some of you will
see before the end of the class.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Ron</b></font>)</div><p/>And so they began. Harry, at least, felt extremely foolish, staring
blankly at the crystal ball, trying to keep his (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) mind empty when thoughts
such as <div class="bookquote">``this is stupid''  (<font color='red'><b>Harry/Potter/Harry Potter</b></font>)</div>kept drifting across it. It didn't help that
Ron kept breaking into silent giggles and Hermione kept tutting.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Seen anything yet?''  (<font color='red'><b>Harry/Potter/Harry Potter</b></font>)</div>Harry asked them after a quarter of an hour's quiet
crystal gazing.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Yeah, there's a burn on this table,''  (<font color='red'><b>Ron</b></font>)</div>said Ron, pointing. <div class="bookquote">``Someone's
spilled their candle.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``This is such a waste of time,''  (<font color='red'><b>Hermione/HERMIONE</b></font>)</div>Hermione hissed. <div class="bookquote">``I could be practicing
something useful. I could be catching up on Cheering Charms --''

 (<font color='red'><b>Professor</b></font>)</div><p/>Professor Trelawney rustled past.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Would anyone like me to help them interpret the shadowy portents within
their Orb?''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Hermione</b></font>) murmured over the clinking of her (<font color='blue'><b>Hermione</b></font>) bangles.

<p/>I don't need help,'' Ron whispered. <div class="bookquote">``It's obvious what this means.
There's going to be loads of fog tonight.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Harry/Potter/Harry Potter</b></font>)</div><p/>Both Harry and Hermione burst out laughing.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Now, really!''  (<font color='red'><b>Professor</b></font>)</div>said Professor Trelawney as everyone's heads turned in
their direction. Parvati and Lavender were looking scandalized. <div class="bookquote">``You are
disturbing the clairvoyant vibrations!''  (<font color='red'><b>She</b></font>)</div>She (<font color='blue'><b>Parvati</b></font>) approached their table and
peered into their crystal ball. Harry felt his (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) heart sinking. He (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) was
sure he (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) knew what was coming --

<p/><div class="bookquote">``There is something here!''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>Professor Trelawney whispered, lowerng her (<font color='blue'><b>Parvati</b></font>)
face to the ball, so that it was reflected twice in her (<font color='blue'><b>Parvati</b></font>) huge glasses.
<div class="bookquote">``Something moving... but what is it?''

 (<font color='red'><b>Harry/Potter/Harry Potter</b></font>)</div><p/>Harry was prepared to bet everything he (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) owned, Including his (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) Firebolt,
that it wasn't good news, whatever it was. And sure enough --

<p/>``My dear Professor Trelawney breathed, gazing up at Harry. <div class="bookquote">``It is here,
plainer than ever before... my dear, stalking toward you, growing ever
closer... the Gr --''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Oh, for goodness' sake!''  (<font color='red'><b>Hermione/HERMIONE</b></font>)</div>said Hermione loudly. <div class="bookquote">``Not that ridiculous
Grim again!''

 (<font color='red'><b>Professor</b></font>)</div><p/>Professor Trelawney raised her (<font color='blue'><b>Hermione</b></font>) enormous eyes to Hermione's face. Parvati
whispered something to Lavender, and they both glared at Hermione too.
Professor Trelawney stood up, surveying Hermione with unmistakable
anger.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``I am sorry to say that from the moment you have arrived in this class
my dear, it has been apparent that you do not have what the noble art of
Divination requires. Indeed, I don't remember ever meeting a student
whose mind was so hopelessly mundane.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/>There was a moment's silence. Then --

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Fine!''  (<font color='red'><b>Hermione/HERMIONE</b></font>)</div>said Hermione suddenly, getting up and cramming Unfogging the
Future back into her (<font color='blue'><b>Hermione</b></font>) bag. <div class="bookquote">``Fine!''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Hermione</b></font>) repeated, swinging the bag over
her (<font color='blue'><b>Hermione</b></font>) shoulder and almost knocking Ron off his (<font color='blue'><b>Ron</b></font>) chair. <div class="bookquote">``I give up! I'm
leaving!''

 (<font color='red'><b>Hermione/HERMIONE</b></font>)</div><p/>And to the whole class's amazement, Hermione strode over to the
trapdoor, kicked it open, and climbed down the ladder out of sight.

<p/>It took a few minutes for the class to settle down again. Professor
Trelawney seemed to have forgotten all about the Grim. She (<font color='blue'><b>Hermione</b></font>) turned
abruptly from Harry and Ron's table, breathing rather heavily as she (<font color='blue'><b>Hermione</b></font>)
tugged her (<font color='blue'><b>Hermione</b></font>) gauzy shawl more closely to her (<font color='blue'><b>Hermione</b></font>).

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Ooooo!''  (<font color='red'><b>everyone</b></font>)</div>said Lavender suddenly, making everyone start. ``Ooooo,
Professor Trelawney, I've just remembered! You saw her (<font color='blue'><b>student</b></font>) leaving, didn't
you? Didn't you, Professor? ``Around Easter, one of our number will leave
us forever!<div class="bookquote">'' You said it ages ago, Professor!''

 (<font color='red'><b>Professor</b></font>)</div><p/>Professor Trelawney gave her (<font color='blue'><b>Hermione</b></font>) a dewy smile.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Yes, my dear, I did indeed know that Miss Granger would be leaving us.
One hopes, however, that one might have mistaken the Signs... The Inner
Eye can be a burden, you know...''

 (<font color='red'><b>Parvati/Parvati Patil</b></font>)</div><p/>Lavender and Parvati looked deeply impressed, and moved over so that
Professor Trelawney could join their table instead.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Some day Hermione's having, eh?''  (<font color='red'><b>Ron</b></font>)</div>Ron muttered to Harry, looking awed.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Yeah...''

 (<font color='red'><b>Harry/Potter/Harry Potter</b></font>)</div><p/>Harry glanced into the crystal ball but saw nothing but swirling white
mist. Had Professor Trelawney really seen the Grim again? Would he (<font color='blue'><b>Professor</b></font>)? The
last thing he (<font color='blue'><b>Professor</b></font>) needed was another near-fatal accident, with the Quidditch
final drawing ever nearer.

<p/>The Easter holidays were not exactly relaxing. The third years had never
had so much homework. Neville Longbottom seemed close to a nervous
collapse, and he (<font color='blue'><b>Longbottom</b></font>) wasn't the only one.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Call this a holiday!''  (<font color='red'><b>Seamus Finnigan/Seamus</b></font>)</div>Seamus Finnigan roared at the common room one
afternoon. <div class="bookquote">``The exams are ages away, what're they playing at?''

 (<font color='red'><b>nobody</b></font>)</div><p/>But nobody had as much to do as Hermione. Even without Divination, she (<font color='blue'><b>Hermione</b></font>)
was taking more subjects than anybody else. She (<font color='blue'><b>Hermione</b></font>) was usually last to
leave the common room at night, first to arrive at the library the next
morning; she (<font color='blue'><b>Hermione</b></font>) had shadows like Lupin's under her (<font color='blue'><b>Hermione</b></font>) eyes, and seemed
constantly close to tears.

<p/>Ron had taken over responsibility for Buckbeak's appeal. When he (<font color='blue'><b>Ron</b></font>) wasn't
doing his (<font color='blue'><b>Ron</b></font>) own work, he (<font color='blue'><b>Ron</b></font>) was poring over enormously thick volumes with
names like The Handbook of Hippogriff Psychology and Fowl or Foul? A
Study of Hippogriff Brutality. He (<font color='blue'><b>Ron</b></font>) was so absorbed, he (<font color='blue'><b>Ron</b></font>) even forgot to be
horrible to Crookshanks.

<p/>Harry, meanwhile, had to fit in his (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) homework around Quidditch practice
every day, not to mention endless discussions of tactics with Wood. The
Gryffindor-Slytherin match would take place on the first Saturday after
the Easter holidays. Slytherin was leading the tournament by exactly two
hundred points. This meant -LRB-as Wood constantly reminded his (<font color='blue'><b>Wood</b></font>) team-RRB- that
they needed to win the match by more than that amount to win the Cup. It
also meant that the burden of winning fell largely on Harry, because
capturing the Snitch was worth one hundred and fifty points.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``So you must catch it only if we're more than fifty points up,''  (<font color='red'><b>Wood/Oliver/Oliver Wood</b></font>)</div>Wood
told Harry constantly. <div class="bookquote">``Only if we're more than fifty points up, Harry,
or we win the match but lose the Cup. You've got that, Haven't you? You
must catch the Snitch only if we're --''

 (<font color='red'><b>Harry/Potter/Harry Potter</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I KNOW, OLIVER!''  (<font color='red'><b>Harry/Potter/Harry Potter</b></font>)</div>Harry yelled.

<p/>The whole of Gryffindor House was obsessed with the coming match.
Gryffindor hadn't won the Quidditch Cup since the legendary Charlie
Weasley -LRB-Ron's second oldest brother-RRB- had been seeker. But Harry doubted
whether any of them, even Wood, wanted to win as much as he (<font color='blue'><b>Wood</b></font>) did. The
enmity between Harry and Malfoy was at its highest point ever. Malfoy
was still smarting ,bout the mud-throwing incident in Hogsmeade and was
even more furious that Harry had somehow wormed his (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) way out of
punishment. Harry hadn't forgotten Malfoy's attempt to sabotage him (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) in
the match against Ravenclaw, but it was the matter of Buckbeak that made
him (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) most determined to beat Malfoy in front of the entire school.

<p/>Never, in anyone's memory, had a match approached in such a highly
charged atmosphere. By the time the holidays were over, tension between
the two teams and their Houses was at the breaking point. A number of
small scuffles broke out in the corridors, culminating in a nasty
incident in which a Gryffindor fourth year and a Slytherin sixth year
ended up in the hospital wing with leeks sprouting out of their ears.

<p/>Harry was having a particularly bad time of it. He (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) couldn't walk to
class without Slytherins sticking out their legs and trying to trip him (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>)
up; Crabbe and Goyle kept popping up wherever he (<font color='blue'><b>Crabbe</b></font>) went, and slouching
away looking disappointed when they saw him (<font color='blue'><b>Crabbe</b></font>) surrounded by people. Wood
had given instructions that Harry should be accompanied everywhere he (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>)
went, in case the Slytherins tried to put him (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) out of action. The whole
of Gryffindor House took up the challenge enthusiastically, so that it
was impossible for Harry to get to classes on time because he (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) was
surrounded by a vast, chattering crowd. Harry was more concerned for his (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>)
Firebolt's safety than his (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) own. When he (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) wasn't flying it, he (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) locked it
securely in his (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) trunk and frequently dashed back up to Gryffindor Tower
at break times to check that it was still there.

<p/>All usual pursuits were abandoned in the Gryffindor common room the
night before the match. Even Hermione had Put down her (<font color='blue'><b>Hermione</b></font>) books.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``I can't work, I can't concentrate,''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Hermione</b></font>) said nervously.

<p/>There was a great deal of noise. Fred and George Weasley were dealing
with the pressure by being louder and more exuberant than ever. Oliver
Wood was crouched over a model of a Quidditch field in the corner,
prodding little figures across it with his (<font color='blue'><b>Wood</b></font>) wand and muttering to himself
Angelina, Alicia, and Katie were laughing at Fred's and George's jokes.
Harry was sitting with Ron and Hermione, removed from the center of
things, trying not to think about the next day, because every time he (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>)
did, he (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) had the horrible sensation that something very large was
fighting to get out of his (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) stomach.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``You're going to be fine,''  (<font color='red'><b>Hermione/HERMIONE</b></font>)</div>Hermione told him (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>), though she (<font color='blue'><b>Hermione</b></font>) looked
positively terrified.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``You've got a Firebolt!''  (<font color='red'><b>Ron</b></font>)</div>said Ron.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Yeah...''  (<font color='red'><b>Harry/Potter/Harry Potter</b></font>)</div>said Harry, his (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) stomach writhing.

<p/>It came as a relief when Wood suddenly stood up and yelled, <div class="bookquote">``Team! Bed!''

 (<font color='red'><b>Wood/Oliver/Oliver Wood</b></font>)</div><p/>Harry slept badly. First he (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) dreamed that he (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) had overslept, and that Wood
was yelling, <div class="bookquote">``Where were you? We had to use Neville instead!''  (<font color='red'><b>Wood/Oliver/Oliver Wood</b></font>)</div>Then he (<font color='blue'><b>Wood</b></font>)
dreamed that Malfoy and the rest of the Slytherin team arrived for the
match riding dragons. He (<font color='blue'><b>Malfoy</b></font>) was flying at breakneck speed, trying to avoid
a spurt of flames from Malfoy's steed's mouth, when he (<font color='blue'><b>Malfoy</b></font>) realized he (<font color='blue'><b>Malfoy</b></font>) had
forgotten his (<font color='blue'><b>Malfoy</b></font>) Firebolt. He (<font color='blue'><b>Malfoy</b></font>) fell through the air and woke with a start.

<p/>It was a few seconds before Harry remembered that the match hadn't taken
place yet, that he (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) was safe in bed, and that the Slytherin team
definitely wouldn't be allowed to play on dragons. He (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) was feeling very
thirsty. Quietly as he (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) could, he (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) got out of his (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) four-poster and went to
pour himself some water from the silver jug beneath the window.

<p/>The grounds were still and quiet. No breath of wind disturbed the
treetops in the Forbidden Forest; the Whomping Willow was motionless and
innocent-looking. It looked as though the conditions for the match would
be perfect.

<p/>Harry set down his (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) goblet and was about to turn back to his (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) bed when
something caught his (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) eye. An animal of some kind was prowling across the
silvery lawn.

<p/>Harry dashed to his (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) bedside table, snatched up his (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) glasses, and put them
on, then hurried back to the window. It couldn't be the Grim -- not now
-- not right before the match -

<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Grim</b></font>) peered out at the grounds again and, after a minute's frantic
searching, spotted it. It was skirting the edge of the forest now... It
wasn't the Grim at all ... it was a cat... Harry clutched the window
ledge in relief as he (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) recognized the bottlebrush tail. It was only
Crookshanks...

<p/>Or was it only Crookshanks? Harry squinted, pressing his (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) nose flat
against the glass. Crookshanks seemed to have come to a halt. Harry was
sure he (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) could see something else moving in the shadow of the trees too.

<p/>And just then, it emerged -- a gigantic, shaggy black dog, moving
stealthily across the lawn, Crookshanks trotting at its side. Harry
stared. What did this mean? If Crookshanks could see the dog as well,
how could it be an omen of Harry's death?

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Ron!''  (<font color='red'><b>Harry/Potter/Harry Potter</b></font>)</div>Harry hissed. <div class="bookquote">``Ron! Wake up!''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Huh?''

 (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div><p/>I need you to tell me if you can see something!''

<p/><div class="bookquote">``S'all dark, Harry,''  (<font color='red'><b>Ron</b></font>)</div>Ron muttered thickly. <div class="bookquote">``What're you or, about?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Down here --''

 (<font color='red'><b>Harry/Potter/Harry Potter</b></font>)</div><p/>Harry looked quickly back out of the window.

<p/>Crookshanks and the dog had vanished. Harry climbed onto the windowsill
to look right down into the shadows of the castle, but they weren't
there. Where had they gone?

<p/>A loud snore told him (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) Ron had fallen asleep again.

<p/>Harry and the rest of the Gryffindor team entered the Great Hall the
next day to enormous applause. Harry couldn't help grinning broadly as
he (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) saw that both the Ravenclaw and Hufflepuff tables were applauding
them too. The Slytherin table hissed loudly as they passed. Harry
noticed that Malfoy looked even paler than usual.

<p/>Wood spent the whole of breakfast urging his (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) team to eat, while touching
nothing himself Then he (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) hurried them off to the field before anyone else
had finished, so they could get an idea of the conditions. As they left
the Great Hall, everyone applauded again.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Good luck, Harry!''  (<font color='red'><b>Cho/Cho Chang/Chang</b></font>)</div>called Cho. Harry felt himself blushing.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Okay -- no wind to speak of -- sun's a bit bright, that could impair
your vision, watch out for it -- ground's fairly hard, good, that'll
give us a fast kickoff --''

 (<font color='red'><b>Wood/Oliver/Oliver Wood</b></font>)</div><p/>Wood paced the field, staring around with the team behind him (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>). Finally,
they saw the front doors of the castle open in the distance and the rest
of the school spilling onto the lawn.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Locker rooms,''  (<font color='red'><b>Wood/Oliver/Oliver Wood</b></font>)</div>said Wood tersely.

<p/>None of them spoke as they changed into their scarlet robes. Harry
wondered if they were feeling like he (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) was: as though he (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>)'d eaten
something extremely wriggly for breakfast. In what seemed like no time
at all, Wood was saying, <div class="bookquote">``Okay, it's time, let's go --''

 (<font color='red'><b>Wood/Oliver/Oliver Wood</b></font>)</div><p/>They walked out onto the field to a tidal wave of noise. Threequarters
of the crowd was wearing scarlet rosettes, waving scarlet flags with the
Gryffindor lion upon them, or brandishing banners with slogans like <div class="bookquote">``GO
GRYFFINDOR!''  (<font color='red'><b>Gryffindor</b></font>)</div>and ``LIONS FOR THE CUK' Behind the Slytherin goal posts,
however, two hundred people were wearing green; the silver serpent of
Slytherin glittered on their flags, and Professor Snape sat in the very
front row, wearing green like everyone else, and a very grim smile.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``And here are the Gryffindors!''  (<font color='red'><b>Lee/Lee Jordan/Jordan</b></font>)</div>yelled Lee Jordan, who was acting as
commentator as usual. <div class="bookquote">``Potter, Bell, Johnson, Spinnet, Weasley, Weasley,
and Wood. Widely acknowledged as the best team Hogwarts has seen in a
good few years --''

 (<font color='red'><b>Lee/Lee Jordan/Jordan</b></font>)</div><p/>Lee's comments were drowned by a tide of <div class="bookquote">``boos''  (<font color='red'><b>Lee/Lee Jordan/Jordan</b></font>)</div>from the Slytherin end.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``And here come the Slytherin team, led by Captain Flint. He (<font color='blue'><b>Flint</b></font>)'s Made some
changes in the lineup and seems to be going for size rather than skill
--''

 (<font color='red'><b>Slytherin</b></font>)</div><p/>More boos from the Slytherin crowd. Harry, however, thought Lee had a
point. Malfoy was easily the smallest person On the Slytherin team; the
rest of them were enormous.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Captains, shake hands!''  (<font color='red'><b>Madam Hooch</b></font>)</div>said Madam Hooch.

<p/>Flint and Wood approached each other and grasped each other's hand very
tightly; it looked as though each was trying to break the other's
fingers.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Mount your brooms!''  (<font color='red'><b>Madam Hooch</b></font>)</div>said Madam Hooch. <div class="bookquote">``Three... two... one...''

 (<font color='red'><b>Harry/Potter/Harry Potter</b></font>)</div><p/>The sound of her (<font color='blue'><b>Hooch</b></font>) whistle was lost in the roar from the crowd as fourteen
brooms rose into the air. Harry felt his (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) hair fly back off his (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) forehead;
his (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) nerves left him (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) in the thrill of the flight; he (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) glanced around, saw
Malfoy on his (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) tail, and sped off in search of the Snitch.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``And it's Gryffindor in possession, Alicia Spinner of Gryffindor with
the Quaffle, heading straight for the Slytherin goal posts, looking
good, Alicia! Argh, no -- Quaffle intercepted by Warrington, Warrington
of Slytherin tearing UP the field -- WHAM! -- nice Bludger work there by
George Weasley, Warrington drops the Quaffle, it's caught by -- Johnson,
Gryffindor back in possession, come on, Angelina -- nice swerve around
Montague -- duck, Angelina, that's a Bludger!- SHE SCORES! TEN-ZERO TO
GRYFFINDOR!''

 (<font color='red'><b>Angelina</b></font>)</div><p/>Angelina punched the air as she (<font color='blue'><b>Angelina</b></font>) soared around the end of the field; the
sea of scarlet below was screaming its delight

<p/><div class="bookquote">``OUCH!''

 (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div><p/>Angelina was nearly thrown from her (<font color='blue'><b>Angelina</b></font>) broom as Marcus Flint went smashing
into her (<font color='blue'><b>Angelina</b></font>).

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Sorry!''  (<font color='red'><b>Flint</b></font>)</div>said Flint as the crowd below booed. <div class="bookquote">``Sorry, didn't see her (<font color='blue'><b>Angelina</b></font>)!''

 (<font color='red'><b>Fred/Fred Weasley</b></font>)</div><p/>A moment later, Fred Weasley chucked his (<font color='blue'><b>Weasley</b></font>) Beater's club at the back of
Flint's head. Flint's nose smashed into the handle of his (<font color='blue'><b>Flint</b></font>) broom and
began to bleed.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``That will do!''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>shrieked Madam Hooch, zooming between then. <div class="bookquote">``Penalty
shot to Gryffindor for an unprovoked attack on their Chaser! Penalty
shot to Slytherin for deliberate damage to their Chaser!''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Come off it, Miss!''  (<font color='red'><b>Fred/Fred Weasley</b></font>)</div>howled Fred, but Madam Hooch blew her (<font color='blue'><b>Hooch</b></font>) whistle and
Alicia flew forward to take the penalty.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Come on, Alicia!''  (<font color='red'><b>Lee/Lee Jordan/Jordan</b></font>)</div>yelled Lee into the silence that had descended on the
crowd. ``YES! SHE<div class="bookquote">``S BEATEN THE KEEPER! TWENTY-ZERO TO GRYFFINDOR!''

 (<font color='red'><b>Harry/Potter/Harry Potter</b></font>)</div><p/>Harry turned the Firebolt sharply to watch Flint, still bleeding freely,
fly forward to take the Slytherin penalty. Wood was hovering in front of
the Gryffindor goal posts, his (<font color='blue'><b>Wood</b></font>) jaw clenched.

<p/><div class="bookquote">''`Course, Wood's a superb Keeper!''  (<font color='red'><b>Gryffindor</b></font>)</div>Lee Jordan told the crowd as Flint
waited for Madam Hooch's whistle. ``Superb! Very difficult to pass --
very difficult indeed -- YES! I DON``T BELIEVE IT! HE (<font color='blue'><b>their</b></font>)<div class="bookquote">``S SAVED IT!''

 (<font color='red'><b>HE</b></font>)</div><p/>Relieved, Harry zoomed away, gazing around for the Snitch, but still
making sure he (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) caught every word of Lee's commentary. It was essential
that he (<font color='blue'><b>Lee</b></font>) hold Malfoy off the Snitch until Gryffindor was more than fifty
points up --

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Gryffindor in possession, no, Slytherin in possession -- no!

<p/>Gryffindor back in possession and it's Katie Bell, Katie Bell for
Gryffindor with the Quaffle, she (<font color='blue'><b>Bell</b></font>)'s streaking up the field -- THAT WAS
DELIBERATE!''

 (<font color='red'><b>Gryffindor</b></font>)</div><p/>Montague, a Slytherin Chaser, had swerved in front of Katie, and instead
of seizing the Quaffle had grabbed her (<font color='blue'><b>Katie</b></font>) head. Katie cart wheeled in the
air, managed to stay on her (<font color='blue'><b>Katie</b></font>) broom, but dropped the Quaffle.

<p/>Madam Hooch's whistle rang out again as she (<font color='blue'><b>Hooch</b></font>) soared over to Montague and
began shouting at him (<font color='blue'><b>Lee</b></font>). A minute later, Katie had put another penalty
past the Slytherin Seeker.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``THIRTY-ZERO! TAKE THAT, YOU DIRTY, CHEATING --''

 (<font color='red'><b>Harry/Potter/Harry Potter</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Jordan, if you can't commentate in an unbiased way --''

 (<font color='red'><b>Harry/Potter/Harry Potter</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I'm telling it like it is, Professor!''

 (<font color='red'><b>Harry/Potter/Harry Potter</b></font>)</div><p/>Harry felt a huge jolt of excitement. He (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) had seen the Snitch it was
shimmering at the foot of one of the Gryffindor goal posts -- but he (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>)
mustn't catch it yet -- and if Malfoy saw it -

<p/>Faking a look of sudden concentration, Harry pulled his (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) Firebolt around
and sped off toward the Slytherin end -- it worked. Malfoy went haring
after him (<font color='blue'><b>Malfoy</b></font>), clearly thinking Harry had seen the Snitch there...

<p/>WHOOSH.

<p/>One of the Bludgers came streaking past Harry's right ear, hit by the
gigantic Slytherin Beater, Derrick. Then again

<p/>WHOOSH.

<p/>The second Bludger grazed Harry's elbow. The other Beater, Bole, was
closing in.

<p/>Harry had a fleeting glimpse of Bole and Derrick zooming toward him (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>),
clubs raised --

<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) turned the Firebolt upward at the last second, and Bole and Derrick
collided with a sickening crunch.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Ha haaa!''  (<font color='red'><b>Lee/Lee Jordan/Jordan</b></font>)</div>yelled Lee Jordan as the Slytherin Beaters lurched away from
each other, clutching their heads. <div class="bookquote">``Too bad, boys! You'll need to get up
earlier than that to beat a Firebold And it's Gryffindor in possession
again, as Johnson takes the Quaffle -- Flint alongside her (<font color='blue'><b>Bell</b></font>) -- poke him (<font color='blue'><b>Flint</b></font>)
in the eye, Angelina! -- it was a joke, Professor, it was a joke -- oh
no -- Flint in possession, Flint flying toward the Gryffindor goal
posts, come on now, Wood, save --!''

 (<font color='red'><b>Flint</b></font>)</div><p/>But Flint had scored; there was an eruption of cheers from the Slytherin
end, and Lee swore so badly that Professor McGonagall tried to tug the
magical megaphone away from him (<font color='blue'><b>Lee</b></font>).

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Sorry, Professor, sorry! WoiA happen again! So, Gryffindor in the lead,
thirty points to ten, and Gryffindor in possession --''

 (<font color='red'><b>Harry/Potter/Harry Potter</b></font>)</div><p/>it was turning into the dirtiest game Harry had ever played in. Enraged
that Gryffindor had taken such an early lead, the Slytherins were
rapidly resorting to any means to take the Quaffle. Bole hit Alicia with
his (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) club and tried to say he (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>)'d thought she (<font color='blue'><b>Alicia</b></font>) was a Bludger. George Weasley
elbowed Bole in the face in retaliation. Madam Hooch awarded both teams
penalties, and Wood pulled off another spectacular save, making the
score forty-ten to Gryffindor.

<p/>The Snitch had disappeared again. Malfoy was still keeping close to
Harry as he (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) soared over the match, looking around for it once Gryffindor
was fifty points ahead -

<p/>Katie scored. Fifty-ten. Fred and George Weasley were swooping around
her (<font color='blue'><b>Katie</b></font>), clubs raised, in case any of the Slytherins were thinking of
revenge. Bole and Derrick took advantage of Fred's and George's absence
to aim both Bludgers at Wood; they caught him (<font color='blue'><b>Wood</b></font>) in the stomach, one after
the other, and he (<font color='blue'><b>Wood</b></font>) rolled over in the air, clutching his (<font color='blue'><b>Wood</b></font>) broom,
completely winded.

<p/>Madam Hooch was beside herself

<p/><div class="bookquote">``YOU DO NOT ATTACK THE KEEPER UNLESS THE QUAFFLE IS WITHIN THE SCORING
AREA!''  (<font color='red'><b>Madam Hooch</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Hooch</b></font>) shrieked at Bole and Derrick. <div class="bookquote">``Gryffindor penalty!''

 (<font color='red'><b>Angelina</b></font>)</div><p/>And Angelina scored. Sixty-ten. Moments later, Fred Weasley pelted a
Bludger at Warrington, knocking the Quaffle Out of his (<font color='blue'><b>Weasley</b></font>) hands; Alicia
seized it and put it through the Slytherin goal -- seventy-ten.

<p/>The Gryffindor crowd below was screaming itself hoarse -- Gryffindor was
sixty points in the lead, and if Harry caught the Snitch now, the Cup
was theirs. Harry could almost feel hundreds of eyes following him (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) as he (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>)
soared around the field, high above the rest of the game, with Malfoy
speeding along behind him (<font color='blue'><b>Malfoy</b></font>).

<p/>And then he (<font color='blue'><b>Malfoy</b></font>) saw it. The Snitch was sparkling twenty feet above him (<font color='blue'><b>Malfoy</b></font>).

<p/>Harry put on a huge burst of speed; the wind was roaring in his (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) ears; he (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>)
stretched out his (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) hand, but suddenly, the Firebolt was slowing down --

<p/>Horrified, he (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) looked around. Malfoy had thrown himself forward, grabbed
hold of the Firebolt's tail, and was pulling it back.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``You --''

 (<font color='red'><b>Harry/Potter/Harry Potter</b></font>)</div><p/>Harry was angry enough to hit Malfoy, but couldn't reach -- Malfoy was
panting with the effort of holding onto the Firebolt, but his (<font color='blue'><b>Malfoy</b></font>) eyes were
sparkling maliciously. He (<font color='blue'><b>Malfoy</b></font>) had achieved what he (<font color='blue'><b>Malfoy</b></font>)'d wanted to do -- the
Snitch had disappeared again.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Penalty! Penalty to Gryffindor! I've never seen such tactics.''  (<font color='red'><b>Madam Hooch</b></font>)</div>Madam
Hooch screeched, shooting up to where Malfoy was sliding back onto his (<font color='blue'><b>Malfoy</b></font>)
Nimbus Two Thousand and One.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``YOU CHEATING SCUM!''  (<font color='red'><b>Lee/Lee Jordan/Jordan</b></font>)</div>Lee Jordan was howling into the megaphone, dancing
out of Professor McGonagall's reach. <div class="bookquote">``YOU FILTHY, CHEATING B --''

 (<font color='red'><b>Pprofessor McGonagall</b></font>)</div><p/>Pprofessor McGonagall didn't even bother to tell him (<font color='blue'><b>Professor</b></font>) off She (<font color='blue'><b>Hooch</b></font>) was
actually shaking her (<font color='blue'><b>Hooch</b></font>) finger in Malfoys direction, her (<font color='blue'><b>Hooch</b></font>) hat had fallen
off, and she (<font color='blue'><b>Hooch</b></font>) too was shouting furiously.

<p/>Alicia took Gryffindor's penalty, but she (<font color='blue'><b>Alicia</b></font>) was so angry she (<font color='blue'><b>Alicia</b></font>) missed by
several feet. The Gryffindor team was losing concentration and the
Slytherins, delighted by Malfoy's foul on Harry, were being spurred on
to greater heights.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Slytherin in possession, Slytherin heading for goal -- Montague scores
--''  (<font color='red'><b>Lee/Lee Jordan/Jordan</b></font>)</div>Lee groaned. <div class="bookquote">``Seventy- twenty to Gryffindor...''

 (<font color='red'><b>Harry/Potter/Harry Potter</b></font>)</div><p/>Harry was now marking Malfoy so closely their knees kept hitting each
other. Harry wasn't going to let Malfoy anywhere near the Snitch...

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Get out of it, Potter!''  (<font color='red'><b>Malfoy</b></font>)</div>Malfoy yelled in frustration as he (<font color='blue'><b>Malfoy</b></font>) tried to
turn and found Harry blocking him (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>).

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Angelina Johnson gets the Quaffle for Gryffindor, come on, Angelina,
COME ON!''

 (<font color='red'><b>Harry</b></font>)</div><p/>Harry looked around. Every single Slytherin player apart from Malfoy was
streaking up the pitch toward Angelina, including the Slytherin Keeper
-- they were all going to block her (<font color='blue'><b>Angelina</b></font>) --

<p/>Harry wheeled the Firebolt around, bent so low he (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) was lying flat along
the handle, and kicked it forward. Like a bullet, he (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) shot toward the
Slytherins.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``AAAAAAARRRGH!''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/>They scattered as the Firebolt zoomed toward them; Angelina's Way was
clear.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``SHE SCORES! SHE SCORES! Gryffindor leads by eighty Points to twenty!''

 (<font color='red'><b>Harry/Potter/Harry Potter</b></font>)</div><p/>Harry, who had almost pelted headlong into the stands, skidded to a halt
in midair, reversed, and zoomed back into the middle of the field.

<p/>And then he (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) saw something to make his (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) heart stand still. Malfoy was
diving, a look of triumph on his (<font color='blue'><b>Malfoy</b></font>) face -- there, a few feet above the
grass below, was a tiny, golden glimmer -

<p/>Harry urged the Firebolt downward, but Malfoy was miles ahead -

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Go! Go! Go!''  (<font color='red'><b>Malfoy/Draco Malfoy/Draco</b></font>)</div>Harry urged his (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) broom. He (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) was gaining on Malfay -- Harry
flattened himself to the broom handle as Bole sent a Bludger at him (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) --
he (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) was at Malfoy's ankles -- he (<font color='blue'><b>Malfoy</b></font>) was level --

<p/>Harry threw himself forward, took both hands off his (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) broom. He (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) knocked
Malfoy's arm out of the way and --

<p/><div class="bookquote">``YES!''

 (<font color='red'><b>Malfoy/Draco Malfoy/Draco</b></font>)</div><p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Malfoy</b></font>) pulled out of his (<font color='blue'><b>Malfoy</b></font>) dive, his (<font color='blue'><b>Malfoy</b></font>) hand in the air, and the stadium
exploded. Harry soared above the crowd, an odd ringing in his (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) ears. The
tiny golden ball was held tight in his (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) fist, beating its wings
hopelessly against his (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) fingers.

<p/>Then Wood was speeding toward him (<font color='blue'><b>Wood</b></font>), half-blinded by tears; he (<font color='blue'><b>Wood</b></font>) seized
Harry around the neck and sobbed unrestrainedly into his (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) shoulder. Harry
felt two large thumps as Fred and George hit them; then Angelina's,
Alicia's, and Katie's voices, <div class="bookquote">``We've won the Cup! We've won the Cup!''
 (<font color='red'><b>Katie/Katie Bell/Bell</b></font>)</div>Tangled together in a many-armed hug, the Gryffindor team sank, yelling
hoarsely, back to earth.

<p/>Wave upon wave of crimson supporters was pouring over the barriers onto
the field. Hands were raining down on their backs. Harry had a confused
impression of noise and bodies pressing in on him (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>). Then he (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>), and the rest
of the team, were hoisted onto the shoulders of the crowd. Thrust into
the light, he (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) saw Hagrid, Plastered with crimson rosettes -- <div class="bookquote">``Yeh beat
'em, Harry, yeh beat 'em!

<p/>Wait till I tell Buckbeak!''  (<font color='red'><b>Hagrid</b></font>)</div>There was Percy, jumping up and down like a
maniac, all dignity forgotten. Professor McGonagall was sobbing harder
even than Wood, wiping her (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) eyes with an enormous Gryffindor flag; and
there, fighting their way toward Harry, were Ron and Hermione. Words
failed them. They simply beamed as Harry was borne toward the stands,
where Dumbledore stood waiting with the enormous Quidditch Cup.

<p/>If only there had been a dementor around... As a sobbing Wood passed
Harry the Cup, as he (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) lifted it into the air, Harry felt he (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) could have
produced the world's best Patronus.

<p/>CHAPTER SIXTEEN

<p/>PROFESSOR TRELAWNEY``S PREDICTION

<p/>Harry's euphoria at finally winning the Quidditch Cup lasted at least a
week. Even the weather seemed to be celebrating; as June approached, the
days became cloudless and sultry, and all anybody felt like doing was
strolling onto the grounds and flopping down on the grass with several
pints of iced pumpkin juice, perhaps playing a casual game of Gobstones
or watching the giant squid propel itself dreamily across the surface of
the lake.

<p/>But they couldn't. Exams were nearly upon them, and instead of lazing
around outside, the students were forced to remain inside the castle,
trying to bully their brains into concentrating while enticing wafts of
summer air drifted in through the windows. Even Fred and George Weasley
had been spotted working; they were about to take their O.W.L.s
-LRB-Ordinary Wizarding Levels-RRB-. Percy was getting ready to take his (<font color='blue'><b>Percy</b></font>)
N.E.W.T.s -LRB-Nastily Exhausting Wizarding Tests-RRB-, the highest
qualification Hogwarts offered. As Percy hoped to enter the Ministry of
Magic, he (<font color='blue'><b>Percy</b></font>) needed top grades. He (<font color='blue'><b>Percy</b></font>) was becoming increasingly edgy, and gave
very severe punishments to anybody who disturbed the quiet of the common
room in the evenings. In fact, the only person who seemed more anxious
than Percy was Hermione.

<p/>Harry and Ron had given up asking her (<font color='blue'><b>Hermione</b></font>) how she (<font color='blue'><b>Hermione</b></font>) was managing to attend
several classes at once, but they couldn't restrain themselves when they
saw the exam schedule she (<font color='blue'><b>Hermione</b></font>) had drawn up for herself. The first column
read:

<p/>Monday

<p/>9 o'clock, Arithmancy

<p/>9 o'clock, Transfiguration

<p/>Lunch

<p/>1 o'clock, Charms

<p/>1 o'clock, Ancient Runes

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Hermione?''  (<font color='red'><b>Ron</b></font>)</div>Ron said cautiously, because she (<font color='blue'><b>Hermione</b></font>) was liable to explode when
interrupted these days. <div class="bookquote">``Er -- are you sure you've copied down these
times right?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``What?''  (<font color='red'><b>Hermione/HERMIONE</b></font>)</div>snapped Hermione, picking up the exam schedule and examining it.
<div class="bookquote">``Yes, of course I have.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Is there any point asking how you're going to sit for two exams at
once?''  (<font color='red'><b>Harry/Potter/Harry Potter</b></font>)</div>said Harry.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``No,''  (<font color='red'><b>Hermione/HERMIONE</b></font>)</div>said Hermione shortly. <div class="bookquote">``Have either of you seen my copy of
Numerology and Gramatica?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Oh, yeah, I borrowed it for a bit of bedtime reading,''  (<font color='red'><b>Ron</b></font>)</div>said Ron, but
very quietly. Hermione started shifting heaps of parchment Harry, Ron,
and Hermione plenty of opportunity to speak to Hagrid.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Beaky's gettin' a bit depressed,''  (<font color='red'><b>Hagrid</b></font>)</div>Hagrid told them, bending low on the
pretense of checking that Harry's flobberworm was still alive. <div class="bookquote">``Bin
cooped up too long. But still... we'll know day after tomorrow -- one
way or the other --''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/>They had Potions that afternoon, which was an unqualified disaster. Try
as Harry might, he (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) couldn't get his (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) Confusing Concoction to thicken, and
Snape, standing watch with an air of vindictive pleasure, scribbled
something that looked suspiciously like a zero onto his (<font color='blue'><b>Snape</b></font>) notes before
moving away.

<p/>Then came Astronomy at midnight, up on the tallest tower; History of
Magic on Wednesday morning, in which Harry scribbled everything Florean
Fortescue had ever told him (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) about medieval witch-hunts, while wishing he (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>)
could have had one of Fortescue's choco-nut sundaes with him (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) in the
stifling classroom. Wednesday afternoon meant Herbology, in the
greenhouses under a baking-hot sun; then back to the common room once
more, with sunburnt necks, thinking longingly of this time next day,
when it would all be over.

<p/>Their second to last exam, on Thursday morning, was Defense Against the
Dark Arts. Professor Lupin had compiled the most unusual exam any of
them had ever taken; a sort of obstacle course outside in the sun, where
they had to wade across a deep paddling pool containing a grindylow,
cross a series of potholes full of Red Caps, squish their way across a
patch of marsh while ignoring misleading directions from a hinkypunk,
then climb into an old trunk and battle with a new boggart.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Excellent, Harry,''  (<font color='red'><b>Lupin/R. J. Lupin</b></font>)</div>Lupin muttered as Harry climbed out of the trunk,
grinning. <div class="bookquote">``Full marks.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Harry/Potter/Harry Potter</b></font>)</div><p/>Flushed with his (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) success, Harry hung around to watch Ron and Hermione.
Ron did very well until he (<font color='blue'><b>Ron</b></font>) reached the hinkypunk, which successfully
confused him (<font color='blue'><b>Ron</b></font>) into sinking waist-high into the quagmire. Hermione did
everything perfectly until she (<font color='blue'><b>Hermione</b></font>) reached the trunk with the boggart in it.
After about a minute inside it, she (<font color='blue'><b>Hermione</b></font>) burst out again, screaming.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Hermione!''  (<font color='red'><b>Lupin/R. J. Lupin</b></font>)</div>said Lupin, startled. <div class="bookquote">``What's the matter?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``P -- P -- Professor McGonagall!''  (<font color='red'><b>Hermione/HERMIONE</b></font>)</div>Hermione gasped, pointing into the
trunk. <div class="bookquote">``Sh -- she (<font color='blue'><b>Hermione</b></font>) said I'd failed everything!''

 (<font color='red'><b>Hermione/HERMIONE</b></font>)</div><p/>It took a little while to calm Hermione down. When at last she (<font color='blue'><b>Hermione</b></font>) had
regained a grip on herself, she (<font color='blue'><b>Hermione</b></font>), Harry, and Ron went back to the castle.
Ron was still slightly inclined to laugh at Hermione's boggart, but an
argument was averted by the sight that met them on the top of the steps.

<p/>Cornelius Fudge, sweating slightly in his (<font color='blue'><b>Fudge</b></font>) pinstriped cloak, was standing
there staring out at the grounds. He (<font color='blue'><b>Fudge</b></font>) started at the sight of Harry.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Hello there, Harry!''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) said. <div class="bookquote">``Just had an exam, I expect? Nearly
finished?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Yes,''  (<font color='red'><b>Harry/Potter/Harry Potter</b></font>)</div>said Harry. Hermione and Ron, not being on speaking terms with
the Minister of Magic, hovered awkwardly in the background.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Lovely day,''  (<font color='red'><b>Fudge</b></font>)</div>said Fudge, casting an eye over the lake.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Pity... pity...''

 (<font color='red'><b>He</b></font>)</div><p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) sighed deeply and looked down at Harry.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``I'm here on an unpleasant mission, Harry. The Committee for the
Disposal of Dangerous Creatures required a witness to the execution of a
mad hippogriff. As I needed to visit Hogwarts to check on the Black
situation, I was asked to step in.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Does that mean the appeal's already happened?''  (<font color='red'><b>Ron</b></font>)</div>Ron interrupted,
stepping forward.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``No, no, it's scheduled for this afternoon,''  (<font color='red'><b>Fudge</b></font>)</div>said Fudge, looking
curiously at Ron.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Then you might not have to witness an execution at A!''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>said Eon
stoutly. <div class="bookquote">``The hippogriff might get off!''

 (<font color='red'><b>Fudge</b></font>)</div><p/>Before Fudge could answer, two wizards came through the castle doors
behind him (<font color='blue'><b>Ron</b></font>). One was so ancient he (<font color='blue'><b>Ron</b></font>) appeared to be withering before their
very eyes; the other was tall and strapping, with a thin back mustache.
Harry gathered that they were representatives of the Committee for the
Disposal of Dangerous Creatures, because tie very old wizard squinted
toward Hagrid's cabin and said in a feeble voice, <div class="bookquote">``Dear, dear, I'm
getting too old for this... Two o'clock, isn't it, Fudge?''

 (<font color='red'><b>Hagrid</b></font>)</div><p/>The black-mustached man was fingering something in his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) belt; Harry
looked and saw that he (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) was running one broad thumb along the blade of a
shining axe. Ron opened his (<font color='blue'><b>Ron</b></font>) mouth to say something, but Hermione nudged
him (<font color='blue'><b>Ron</b></font>) hard in the ribs and jerked her (<font color='blue'><b>Hermione</b></font>) head toward the entrance hall.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Why'd you stop me?''  (<font color='red'><b>Ron</b></font>)</div>said Ron angrily as they entered the Great Hall for
lunch. <div class="bookquote">``Did you see them? They've even got the axe ready! This isn't
justice!''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Ron, your dad works for the Ministry, you can't go saying things like
that to his (<font color='blue'><b>Ron</b></font>) boss!''  (<font color='red'><b>Hermione/HERMIONE</b></font>)</div>said Hermione, but she (<font color='blue'><b>Hermione</b></font>) too looked very upset. <div class="bookquote">``As
long as Hagrid keeps his (<font color='blue'><b>Ron</b></font>) head this time, and argue, hi case properly,
they can't possibly execute Buckbeak...''

 (<font color='red'><b>Harry/Potter/Harry Potter</b></font>)</div><p/>But Harry could tell Hermione didn't really believe what she (<font color='blue'><b>Hermione</b></font>) was saying.
All around them, people were talking excitedly as they ate their lunch,
happily anticipating the end of the exams that afternoon, but Harry,
Ron, and Hermione, lost in worry about Hagrid and Buckbeak, didn't join
in.

<p/>Harry's and Ron's last exam was Divination; Hermione's, Muggle Studies.
They walked up the marble staircase together; Hermione left them on the
first floor and Harry and Ron proceeded all the way up to the seventh,
where many of their class were sitting on the spiral staircase to
Professor Trelawney's classroom, trying to cram in a bit of last-minute
studying.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``She (<font color='blue'><b>it</b></font>)'s seeing us all separately,''  (<font color='red'><b>Neville/Neville Longbottom/Longbottom</b></font>)</div>Neville informed them as they went to
sit down next to him (<font color='blue'><b>Neville</b></font>). He (<font color='blue'><b>Neville</b></font>) had his (<font color='blue'><b>Neville</b></font>) copy of Unfogging the Future open on
his (<font color='blue'><b>Neville</b></font>) lap at the pages devoted to crystal gazing. <div class="bookquote">``Have either of you ever
seen anything in a crystal ball?''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Neville</b></font>) asked them unhappily.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Nope,''  (<font color='red'><b>Ron</b></font>)</div>said Ron in an offhand voice. He (<font color='blue'><b>Ron</b></font>) kept checking his (<font color='blue'><b>Ron</b></font>) watch; Harry.
knew that he (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) was counting down the time until Buckbeak's appeal started.

<p/>The line of people outside the classroom shortened very slowly. As each
person climbed back down the silver ladder, the rest of the class
hissed, <div class="bookquote">``What did she (<font color='blue'><b>it</b></font>) ask? Was it okay?''

 (<font color='red'><b>each person</b></font>)</div><p/>But they all refused to say.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``She (<font color='blue'><b>it</b></font>) says the crystal ball's told her (<font color='blue'><b>it</b></font>) that if I tell you, I'll have a
horrible accident!''  (<font color='red'><b>Neville/Neville Longbottom/Longbottom</b></font>)</div>squeaked Neville as he (<font color='blue'><b>Neville</b></font>) clambered back down the
ladder toward Harry and Ron, who had now reached the landing.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``That's convenient,''  (<font color='red'><b>Ron</b></font>)</div>snorted Ron. <div class="bookquote">``You know, I'm starting to think
Hermione was right about her (<font color='blue'><b>Hermione</b></font>)''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>-- he (<font color='blue'><b>Ron</b></font>) jabbed his (<font color='blue'><b>Ron</b></font>) thumb toward the trapdoor
overhead -- <div class="bookquote">``she (<font color='blue'><b>Hermione</b></font>)'s a right old fraud.''

 (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Yeah,''  (<font color='red'><b>Harry/Potter/Harry Potter</b></font>)</div>said Harry, looking at his (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) own watch. It-was now two o'clock.
<div class="bookquote">``Wish she (<font color='blue'><b>Hermione</b></font>)'d hurry up...''

 (<font color='red'><b>Parvati</b></font>)</div><p/>Parvati came back down the ladder glowing with pride.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``She (<font color='blue'><b>Hermione</b></font>) says I've got all the makings of a true Seer,''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Parvati</b></font>) informed Harry
and Ron. <div class="bookquote">``I saw loads of stuff... Well, good luck!''

 (<font color='red'><b>She</b></font>)</div><p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>Parvati</b></font>) hurried off down the spiral staircase toward Lavender.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Ronald Weasley,''  (<font color='red'><b>Ron</b></font>)</div>said the familiar, misty voice from over their heads.
Ron grimaced at Harry and climbed the silver ladder out of sight. Harry
was now the only person left to be tested. He (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) settled himself on the
floor with his (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) back against the wall, listening to a fly buzzing in the
sunny window, his (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) mind across the grounds with Hagrid.

<p/>Finally, after about twenty minutes, Ron's large feet reappeared on the
ladder.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``How'd it go?''  (<font color='red'><b>Harry/Potter/Harry Potter</b></font>)</div>Harry asked him (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>), standing up.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Rubbish,''  (<font color='red'><b>Ron</b></font>)</div>said Ron. <div class="bookquote">``Couldn't see a thing, so I made some stuff up.
Don't think she (<font color='blue'><b>Hermione</b></font>) was convinced, though...''

 (<font color='red'><b>Harry/Potter/Harry Potter</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Meet you in the common room,''  (<font color='red'><b>Harry/Potter/Harry Potter</b></font>)</div>Harry muttered as Professor Trelawney's
voice called, <div class="bookquote">``Harry Potter!''

 (<font color='red'><b>Trelawney/Sibyll/Sibyll Trelawney</b></font>)</div><p/>The tower room was hotter than ever before; the curtains were closed,
the fire was alight, and the usual sickly scent made Harry cough as he (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>)
stumbled through the clutter of chairs and table to where Professor
Trelawney sat waiting for him (<font color='blue'><b>Professor</b></font>) before a large crystal ball.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Good day, my dear,''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) said softly. <div class="bookquote">``If you would kindly gaze into the
Orb... Take your time, now... then tell me what you see within it...''

 (<font color='red'><b>Harry/Potter/Harry Potter</b></font>)</div><p/>Harry bent over the crystal ball and stared, stared as hard as he (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) could,
willing it to show him (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) something other than swirling white fog, but
nothing happened.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Well?''  (<font color='red'><b>Professor</b></font>)</div>Professor Trelawney prompted delicately. <div class="bookquote">``What do you see?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/>The heat was overpowering and his (<font color='blue'><b>Professor</b></font>) nostrils were stinging with the
perfumed smoke wafting from the fire beside them. He (<font color='blue'><b>Professor</b></font>) thought of what Ron
had just said, and decided to pretend.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Er --''  (<font color='red'><b>Harry/Potter/Harry Potter</b></font>)</div>said Harry, <div class="bookquote">``a dark shape... um...''

 (<font color='red'><b>Harry/Potter/Harry Potter</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``What does it resemble?''  (<font color='red'><b>Harry/Potter/Harry Potter</b></font>)</div>whispered Professor Trelawney. <div class="bookquote">``Think, now...''

 (<font color='red'><b>Harry/Potter/Harry Potter</b></font>)</div><p/>Harry cast his (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) mind around and it landed on Buckbeak.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``A hippogriff,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) said firmly.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Indeed!''  (<font color='red'><b>Professor</b></font>)</div>whispered Professor Trelawney, scribbling keenly on the
parchment perched upon her (<font color='blue'><b>Professor</b></font>) knees. <div class="bookquote">``My boy, you may well be seeing the
outcome of poor Hagrid's trouble with the Ministry of Magic! Look
closer... Does the hippogriff appear to... have its head?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Yes,''  (<font color='red'><b>Harry/Potter/Harry Potter</b></font>)</div>said Harry firmly.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Are you sure?''  (<font color='red'><b>Professor</b></font>)</div>Professor Trelawney urged him (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>). <div class="bookquote">``Are you quite sure,
dear? You don't see it writhing on the ground, perhaps, and a shadowy
figure raising an axe behind it?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``No!''  (<font color='red'><b>Harry/Potter/Harry Potter</b></font>)</div>said Harry, starting to feel slightly sick.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``No blood? No weeping Hagrid?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``No!''  (<font color='red'><b>Harry/Potter/Harry Potter</b></font>)</div>said Harry again, wanting more than ever to leave the room and the
heat. <div class="bookquote">``It looks fine, it's - - flying away...''

 (<font color='red'><b>Professor</b></font>)</div><p/>Professor Trelawney sighed.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Well, dear, I think we'll leave it there... A little disappointing...
but I'm sure you did your best.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Harry/Potter/Harry Potter</b></font>)</div><p/>Relieved, Harry got up, picked up his (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) bag and turned to go, but then a
loud, harsh voice spoke behind him (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>).

<p/><div class="bookquote">``IT WILL HAPPEN TONIGHT.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Harry/Potter/Harry Potter</b></font>)</div><p/>Harry wheeled around. Professor Trelawney had gone rigid in her (<font color='blue'><b>Professor</b></font>)
armchair; her (<font color='blue'><b>Professor</b></font>) eyes were unfocused and her (<font color='blue'><b>Professor</b></font>) mouth sagging.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``S -- sorry?''  (<font color='red'><b>Harry/Potter/Harry Potter</b></font>)</div>said Harry.

<p/>But Professor Trelawney didn't seem to hear him (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>). Her (<font color='blue'><b>Professor</b></font>) eyes started to
roll. Harry sat there in a panic. She (<font color='blue'><b>Professor</b></font>) looked as though she (<font color='blue'><b>Professor</b></font>) was about to
have some sort of seizure. He (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) hesitated, thinking of running to the
hospital wing -- and then Professor Trelawney spoke again, in the same
harsh voice, quite unlike her (<font color='blue'><b>Professor</b></font>) own:

<p/>``THE DARK LORD LIES ALONE AND FRIENDLESS, ABANDONED BY HIS (<font color='blue'><b>I</b></font>) FOLLOWERS.
HIS (<font color='blue'><b>I</b></font>) SERVANT HAS BEEN CHAINED THESE TWELVE YEARS. TONIGHT, BEFORE
MIDNIGHT... THE SERVANT WILL BREAK FREE AND SET OUT TO REJOIN HIS (<font color='blue'><b>I</b></font>)
MASTER. THE DARK LORD WILL RISE AGAIN WITH HIS (<font color='blue'><b>I</b></font>) SERVANTS AID, GREATER AND
MORE TERRIBLE THAN EVER HE (<font color='blue'><b>I</b></font>) WAS. TONIGHT... BEFORE MIDNIGHT... THE
SERVANT... WILL SET OU... TO REJOIN... HIS (<font color='blue'><b>I</b></font>) MASTER...

<p/>Professor Trelawney's head fell forward onto her (<font color='blue'><b>I</b></font>) chest. She (<font color='blue'><b>I</b></font>) made a
grunting sort of noise. Harry sat there, staring at her (<font color='blue'><b>I</b></font>). Then, quite
suddenly, Professor Trelawney's head snapped up again.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``I'm so sorry, dear boy,''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Professor</b></font>) said dreamily, <div class="bookquote">``the heat of the day, you
know... I drifted off for a moment...''

 (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div><p/>Harry sat there, staring at her (<font color='blue'><b>Professor</b></font>).

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Is there anything wrong, my dear?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/>``You -- you just told me that the -- the Dark Lord's going to rise
again... that his (<font color='blue'><b>Lord</b></font>) servant's going to go back to him (<font color='blue'><b>Lord</b></font>).

<p/>Professor Trelawney looked thoroughly startled.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``The Dark Lord? He-Who-Must-Not-Be-Named? My dear boy, that's hardly
something to joke about... Rise again, indeed --''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/>,<div class="bookquote">``But you just said it! You. said the Dark Lord --''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I think you must have dozed off too, dear!''  (<font color='red'><b>Professor</b></font>)</div>said Professor Trelawney.
<div class="bookquote">``I would certainly not presume to predict anything quite as far-fetched
as that!''

 (<font color='red'><b>Harry/Potter/Harry Potter</b></font>)</div><p/>Harry climbed back down the ladder and the spiral staircase,
wondering... had he (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) just heard Professor Trelawney make a real
prediction? Or had that been her (<font color='blue'><b>Professor</b></font>) idea of an impressive end to the test?

<p/>Five minutes later he (<font color='blue'><b>Professor</b></font>) was dashing past the security trolls outside the
entrance to Gryffindor Tower, Professor Trelawney's words still
resounding in his (<font color='blue'><b>Professor</b></font>) head. People were striding past him (<font color='blue'><b>Professor</b></font>) in the opposite
direction, laughing and joking, heading for the grounds and a bit of
long-awaited freedom; by the time he (<font color='blue'><b>Professor</b></font>) had reached the portrait hole and
entered the common room, it was almost deserted. Over in the corner,
however, sat Ron and Hermione.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Professor Trelawney,''  (<font color='red'><b>Harry/Potter/Harry Potter</b></font>)</div>Harry panted, <div class="bookquote">``just told me --''

 (<font color='red'><b>Harry/Potter/Harry Potter</b></font>)</div><p/>But he (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) stopped abruptly at the sight of their faces.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Buckbeak lost,''  (<font color='red'><b>Ron</b></font>)</div>said Ron weakly. <div class="bookquote">``Hagrid's just sent this.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Hagrid</b></font>)</div><p/>Hagrid's note was dry this time, no tears had splattered it, yet his (<font color='blue'><b>Ron</b></font>)
hand seemed to have shaken so much as he (<font color='blue'><b>Ron</b></font>) wrote that it was hardly
legible.

<p/>Lost appeal. They're going to execute at sunset. Nothing you can do.
Don't come down. I don't want you to see it.

<p/>Hagrid

<p/><div class="bookquote">``We've got to go,''  (<font color='red'><b>Hagrid</b></font>)</div>said Harry at once. <div class="bookquote">``He (<font color='blue'><b>Professor</b></font>) can't just sit there on his (<font color='blue'><b>Professor</b></font>)
own, waiting for the executioner!''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Sunset, though,''  (<font color='red'><b>Ron</b></font>)</div>said Ron, who was staring out the window ill a glazed
sort of way. <div class="bookquote">``We'd never be allowed... `specially you, Harry...''

 (<font color='red'><b>Harry/Potter/Harry Potter</b></font>)</div><p/>Harry sank his (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) head into his (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) hands, thinking.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``If we only had the Invisibility Cloak...''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Where is it?''  (<font color='red'><b>Hermione/HERMIONE</b></font>)</div>said Hermione.

<p/>Harry told her (<font color='blue'><b>Hermione</b></font>) about leaving it in the passageway under the one-eyed
witch.

<p/><div class="bookquote">''... if Snape sees me anywhere near there again, I'm in serious
trouble,''  (<font color='red'><b>the witch</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Snape</b></font>) finished.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``That's true,''  (<font color='red'><b>Hermione/HERMIONE</b></font>)</div>said Hermione, getting to her (<font color='blue'><b>Hermione</b></font>) feet. <div class="bookquote">``If he (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) sees you...
How do you open the witch's hump again?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``You -- you tap it and say, `Dissendium,'''  (<font color='red'><b>Harry/Potter/Harry Potter</b></font>)</div>said Harry. <div class="bookquote">``But --''

 (<font color='red'><b>Hermione/HERMIONE</b></font>)</div><p/>Hermione didn't wait for the rest of his (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) sentence; she (<font color='blue'><b>Hermione</b></font>) strode across the
room, pushed open the Fat Lady's portrait and vanished from sight.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``She (<font color='blue'><b>witch</b></font>) hasn't gone to get it?''  (<font color='red'><b>Ron</b></font>)</div>Ron said, staring after her (<font color='blue'><b>Lady</b></font>).

<p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>Lady</b></font>) had. Hermione returned a quarter of an hour later with the silvery
cloak folded carefully under her (<font color='blue'><b>Hermione</b></font>) robes.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Hermione, I don't know what's gotten, into you lately!''  (<font color='red'><b>Ron</b></font>)</div>said Ron,
astounded. <div class="bookquote">``First you hit Malfoy, then you walk out on Professor
Trelawney --''

 (<font color='red'><b>Hermione/HERMIONE</b></font>)</div><p/>Hermione looked rather flattered.

<p/>They went down to dinner with everybody else, but did not return to
Gryffindor Tower afterward. Harry had the cloak hidden down tie front of
his (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) robes; he (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) had to keep his (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) arms folded to hide the lump. They skulked
in an empty chamber off the entrance hall, listening, until they were
sure it was deserted. They heard a last pair of people hurrying across
the hall and a door slamming. Hermione poked her (<font color='blue'><b>Hermione</b></font>) head around the door.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Okay,''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Hermione</b></font>) whispered, <div class="bookquote">``no one there -- cloak on --''

 (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div><p/>Walking very close together so that nobody would see them, they crossed
the hall on tiptoe beneath the cloak, then walked down the stone front
steps into the grounds. The sun was already sinking behind the Forbidden
Forest, gilding the top branches of the trees.

<p/>They reached Hagrid's cabin and knocked. He (<font color='blue'><b>They</b></font>) was a minute in answering,
and when he (<font color='blue'><b>They</b></font>) did, he (<font color='blue'><b>They</b></font>) looked all around for his (<font color='blue'><b>They</b></font>) visitor, pale-faced and
trembling.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``It's us,''  (<font color='red'><b>Harry/Potter/Harry Potter</b></font>)</div>Harry hissed. <div class="bookquote">``We're wearing the Invisibility Cloak. Let us
in and we can take it off.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Yeh shouldn've come!''  (<font color='red'><b>Hagrid</b></font>)</div>Hagrid whispered, but he (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) stood back, and they
stepped inside. Hagrid shut the door quickly and Harry pulled off the
cloak.

<p/>Hagrid was not crying, nor did he (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) throw himself upon their necks. He (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>)
looked like a man who did not know where he (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) was or what to do. This
helplessness was worse to watch than tears.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Wan' some tea?''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) said. His (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) great hands were shaking as he (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) reached for
the kettle.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Where's Buckbeak, Hagrid?''  (<font color='red'><b>Hermione/HERMIONE</b></font>)</div>said Hermione hesitantly.

<p/>I -- I took him (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) outside,'' said Hagrid, spilling milk all over the table
as he (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) filled up the jug. ``He (<font color='blue'><b>Professor</b></font>)'s tethered in me pumpkin patch. Thought he (<font color='blue'><b>Professor</b></font>)
oughta see the trees an' -- an' smell fresh air -- before

<p/>Hagrid's hand trembled so violently that the milk jug slipped from his (<font color='blue'><b>Professor</b></font>)
grasp and shattered all over the floor.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``I'll do it, Hagrid,''  (<font color='red'><b>Hermione/HERMIONE</b></font>)</div>said Hermione quickly, hurrying over and starting
to clean up the mess.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``There's another one in the cupboard,''  (<font color='red'><b>Hagrid</b></font>)</div>Hagrid said, sitting down and
wiping his (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) forehead on his (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) sleeve. Harry glanced at Ron, who looked back
hopelessly.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Isn't there anything anyone can do, Hagrid?''  (<font color='red'><b>Harry/Potter/Harry Potter</b></font>)</div>Harry asked fiercely,
sitting down next to him (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>). <div class="bookquote">``Dumbledore --''

 (<font color='red'><b>Hagrid</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``He (<font color='blue'><b>Dumbledore</b></font>)'s tried,''  (<font color='red'><b>Hagrid</b></font>)</div>said Hagrid. <div class="bookquote">``He (<font color='blue'><b>Dumbledore</b></font>)'s got no power ter overrule the
Committee. He (<font color='blue'><b>Dumbledore</b></font>) told 'em Buckbeak's all right, but they're scared... Yeh
know what Lucius Malfoy's like... threatened 'em, I expect... an' the
executioner, Macnair, he (<font color='blue'><b>executioner</b></font>)'s an old pal o' Malfoy's... but it'll be quick
an' clean... an' I'll be beside him (<font color='blue'><b>Malfoy</b></font>)... ''

 (<font color='red'><b>Hagrid</b></font>)</div><p/>Hagrid swallowed. His (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) eyes were darting all over the cabin as though
looking for some shred of hope or comfort.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Dumbledore's gonna come down while it -- while it happens. Wrote me
this mornin'. Said he (<font color='blue'><b>Said</b></font>) wants ter -- ter be with me. Great man,
Dumbledore...''

 (<font color='red'><b>Hermione/HERMIONE</b></font>)</div><p/>Hermione, who had been rummaging in Hagrid's cupboard for another milk
jug, let out a small, quickly stifled sob. She (<font color='blue'><b>Hermione</b></font>) straightened up with the
new jug in her (<font color='blue'><b>Hermione</b></font>) hands, fighting back tears.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``We'll stay with you too, Hagrid,''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Hermione</b></font>) began, but Hagrid shook his (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>)
shaggy head.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Yeh're ter go back up ter the castle. I told yeh, I don' wan' yeh
watchin'. An' yeh shouldn' be down here anyway... If Fudge an'
Dumbledore catch yeh out without permission, Harry, yeh'll be in big
trouble.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Hermione/HERMIONE</b></font>)</div><p/>Silent tears were now streaming down Hermione's face, but she (<font color='blue'><b>Hermione</b></font>) hid them
from Hagrid, bustling around making tea. Then, as she (<font color='blue'><b>Hermione</b></font>) picked up the milk
bottle to pour some into the jug, she (<font color='blue'><b>Hermione</b></font>) let out a shriek.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Ron, I don't believe it -- it's Scabbers!''

 (<font color='red'><b>Ron</b></font>)</div><p/>Ron gaped at her (<font color='blue'><b>Hermione</b></font>).

<p/><div class="bookquote">``What are you talking about?''

 (<font color='red'><b>Hermione/HERMIONE</b></font>)</div><p/>Hermione carried the milk jug over to the table and turned it upside
down. With a frantic squeak, and much scrambling to get back inside,
Scabbers the rat came sliding out onto the table.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Scabbers!''  (<font color='red'><b>Ron</b></font>)</div>said Ron blankly. <div class="bookquote">``Scabbers, what are you doing here?''

 (<font color='red'><b>He</b></font>)</div><p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Ron</b></font>) grabbed the struggling rat and held him (<font color='blue'><b>Ron</b></font>) up to the light. Scabbers
looked dreadful. He (<font color='blue'><b>Ron</b></font>) was thinner than ever, large tufts of hair had
fallen out leaving wide bald patches, and he (<font color='blue'><b>Ron</b></font>) writhed in Ron's hands as
though desperate to free himself

<p/><div class="bookquote">``It's okay, Scabbers!''  (<font color='red'><b>Ron</b></font>)</div>said Ron. <div class="bookquote">``No cats! There's nothing here to hurt
you!''

 (<font color='red'><b>Hagrid</b></font>)</div><p/>Hagrid suddenly stood up, his (<font color='blue'><b>Ron</b></font>) eyes fixed on the window. His (<font color='blue'><b>Ron</b></font>) normally
ruddy face had gone the color of parchment.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``They're comin'...''

 (<font color='red'><b>Harry/Potter/Harry Potter</b></font>)</div><p/>Harry, Ron, and Hermione whipped around. A group of men was walking down
the distant castle steps. In front was Albus Dumbledore, his (<font color='blue'><b>Dumbledore</b></font>) silver
beard gleaming in the dying sun. Next to him (<font color='blue'><b>Dumbledore</b></font>) trotted Cornelius Fudge.
Behind them came the feeble old Committee member and the executioner,
Macnair.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Yeh gotta go,''  (<font color='red'><b>Hagrid</b></font>)</div>said Hagrid. Every inch of him (<font color='blue'><b>member</b></font>) was trembling. <div class="bookquote">``They
mustn' find yeh here... Go now...''

 (<font color='red'><b>Ron</b></font>)</div><p/>Ron stuffed Scabbers into his (<font color='blue'><b>Ron</b></font>) pocket and Hermione picked up the cloak.
<div class="bookquote">``I'll let yeh out the back way,''  (<font color='red'><b>Hagrid</b></font>)</div>said Hagrid.

<p/>They followed him (<font color='blue'><b>Ron</b></font>) to the door into his (<font color='blue'><b>Ron</b></font>) back garden. Harry felt strangely
unreal, and even more so when he (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) saw Buckbeak a few yards away, tethered
to a tree behind Hagrid's Pumpkin patch. Buckbeak seemed to know
something was happening. He (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) turned his (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) sharp head from side to side and
pawed the ground nervously.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``It's okay, Beaky,''  (<font color='red'><b>Hagrid</b></font>)</div>said Hagrid softly. <div class="bookquote">``It's okay...''  (<font color='red'><b>He</b></font>)</div>He (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) turned to
Harry, Ron, and Hermione. <div class="bookquote">``Go on,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Ron</b></font>) said. <div class="bookquote">``Get goin'.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/>But they didn't move.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Hagrid, we can't --''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``We'll tell them what really happened --''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``They can't kill him (<font color='blue'><b>We</b></font>) --''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Go!''  (<font color='red'><b>Hagrid</b></font>)</div>said Hagrid fiercely. <div class="bookquote">``It's bad enough without you lot in trouble
an' all!''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/>They had no choice. As Hermione threw the cloak over Harry and Ron, they
heard voices at the front of the cabin. Hagrid looked at the place where
they had just vanished from sight.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Go quick,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Ron</b></font>) said hoarsely. <div class="bookquote">``Don' listen...''

 (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div><p/>And he (<font color='blue'><b>Ron</b></font>) strode back into his (<font color='blue'><b>Ron</b></font>) cabin as someone knocked at the front door.

<p/>Slowly, in a kind of horrified trance, Harry, Ron, and Hermione set off
silently around Hagrid's house. As they reached the other side, the
front door closed with a sharp snap.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Please, let's hurry,''  (<font color='red'><b>Hermione/HERMIONE</b></font>)</div>Hermione whispered. <div class="bookquote">``I can't stand it, I can't
bear it...''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/>They started up the sloping lawn toward the castle. The sun was sinking
fast now; the sky had turned to a clear, purple-tinged grey, but to the
west there was a ruby-red glow.

<p/>Ron stopped dead.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Oh, please, Ron,''  (<font color='red'><b>Hermione/HERMIONE</b></font>)</div>Hermione began.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``It's Scabbers -- he (<font color='blue'><b>Ron</b></font>) won't -- stay put --''

 (<font color='red'><b>Ron</b></font>)</div><p/>Ron was bent over, trying to keep Scabbers in his (<font color='blue'><b>Ron</b></font>) pocket, but the rat
was going berserk; squeaking madly, twisting and flailing, trying to
sink his (<font color='blue'><b>Ron</b></font>) teeth into Ron's hand.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Scabbers, it's me, you idiot, it's Ron,''  (<font color='red'><b>Ron</b></font>)</div>Ron hissed.

<p/>They heard a door open behind them and men's voices.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Oh, Ron, please let's move, they're going to do it!''  (<font color='red'><b>Hermione/HERMIONE</b></font>)</div>Hermione breathed.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Okay -- Scabbers, stay put --''

 (<font color='red'><b>Harry/Potter/Harry Potter</b></font>)</div><p/>They walked forward; Harry, like Hermione, was trying not to listen to
the rumble of voices behind them. Ron stopped again.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``I can't hold him (<font color='blue'><b>Ron</b></font>) -- Scabbers, shut up, everyone'll hear us --''

 (<font color='red'><b>Hagrid</b></font>)</div><p/>The rat was squealing wildly, but not loudly enough to cover up the
sounds drifting from Hagrid's garden. There was a jumble of indistinct
male voices, a silence, and then, without warning, the unmistakable
swish and thud of an axe.

<p/>Hermione swayed on the spot.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``They did it!''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Hermione</b></font>) whispered to Harry. <div class="bookquote">``I d -- don't believe it -- they
did it!''

 (<font color='red'><b>Harry/Potter/Harry Potter</b></font>)</div><p/>CHAPTER SEVENTEEN

<p/>CAT, RAT, AND DOG

<p/>Harry's mind had gone blank with shock. The three of them stood
transfixed with horror under the Invisibility Cloak. The very last rays
of the setting sun were casting a bloody light over the long- shadowed
grounds. Then, behind them, they heard a wild howling.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Hagrid,''  (<font color='red'><b>Harry/Potter/Harry Potter</b></font>)</div>Harry muttered. Without thinking about what he (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) was doing, he (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>)
made to turn back, but both Ron and Hermione seized his (<font color='blue'><b>Ron</b></font>) arms.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``We can't,''  (<font color='red'><b>Ron</b></font>)</div>said Ron, who was paper-white. <div class="bookquote">``He (<font color='blue'><b>Ron</b></font>)'ll be in worse trouble if
they know we've been to see him (<font color='blue'><b>Ron</b></font>)...''

 (<font color='red'><b>Hermione/HERMIONE</b></font>)</div><p/>Hermione's breathing was shallow and uneven.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``How -- could -- they?''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Hermione</b></font>) choked. <div class="bookquote">``How could they?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Come on,''  (<font color='red'><b>Ron</b></font>)</div>said Ron, whose teeth seemed to be chattering.

<p/>They set off back toward the castle, walking slowly to keep themselves
hidden under the cloak. The light was fading fast now.

<p/>By the time they reached open ground, darkness was settling like a spell
around them.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Scabbers, keep still,''  (<font color='red'><b>Ron</b></font>)</div>Ron hissed, clamping his (<font color='blue'><b>Ron</b></font>) hand over his (<font color='blue'><b>Ron</b></font>) chest.
The rat was wriggling madly. Ron came to a sudden halt, trying to force
Scabbers deeper into his (<font color='blue'><b>Ron</b></font>) pocket. <div class="bookquote">``What's the matter with you, You stupid
rat? Stay still -- OUCH! He (<font color='blue'><b>Ron</b></font>) bit me!''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Ron, be quiet!''  (<font color='red'><b>Hermione/HERMIONE</b></font>)</div>Hermione whispered urgently. <div class="bookquote">``Fudge'll be out here in a
minute --''

 (<font color='red'><b>He</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``He (<font color='blue'><b>Ron</b></font>) won't -- stay -- put --''

 (<font color='red'><b>He</b></font>)</div><p/>Scabbers was plainly terrified. He (<font color='blue'><b>Ron</b></font>) was writhing with all his (<font color='blue'><b>Ron</b></font>) might,
trying to break free of Ron's grip.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``What's the matter with him (<font color='blue'><b>Ron</b></font>)?''

 (<font color='red'><b>Harry/Potter/Harry Potter</b></font>)</div><p/>But Harry had just seen -- stinking toward them, his (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) body low to the
ground, wide yellow eyes glinting eerily in the darkness -- Crookshanks.
Whether he (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) could see them or was following the sound of Scabbers's
squeaks, Harry couldn't tell.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Crookshanks!''  (<font color='red'><b>Hermione/HERMIONE</b></font>)</div>Hermione moaned. <div class="bookquote">``No, go away, Crookshanks! Go away!''

 (<font color='red'><b>the cat</b></font>)</div><p/>But the cat was getting nearer --

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Scabbers -- NO!''

 (<font color='red'><b>the cat</b></font>)</div><p/>Too late -- the rat had slipped between Ron's clutching fingers, hit the
ground, and scampered away. In one bound, Crookshanks sprang after him (<font color='blue'><b>Ron</b></font>),
and before Harry or Hermione could stop him (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>), Ron had thrown the
Invisibility Cloak off himself and pelted away into the darkness.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Ron!''  (<font color='red'><b>Hermione/HERMIONE</b></font>)</div>Hermione moaned.

<p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>Hermione</b></font>) and Harry looked at each other, then followed at a sprint; it ''``as
impossible to run full out under the cloak; they pulled it off and it
streamed behind them like a banner as they hurtled after Ron; they could
hear his (<font color='blue'><b>Ron</b></font>) feet thundering along ahead and his (<font color='blue'><b>Ron</b></font>) shouts at Crookshanks.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Get away from him (<font color='blue'><b>Ron</b></font>) -- get away -- Scabbers, come here --''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/>There was a loud thud.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Gotcha! Get off, you stinking cat --''

 (<font color='red'><b>Harry/Potter/Harry Potter</b></font>)</div><p/>Harry and Hermione almost fell over Ron; they skidded to a stop right in
front of him (<font color='blue'><b>Ron</b></font>). He (<font color='blue'><b>Ron</b></font>) was sprawled on the ground, but Scabbers was back in
his (<font color='blue'><b>Ron</b></font>) pocket; he (<font color='blue'><b>Ron</b></font>) had both hands held tight over the quivering lump.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Ron -- come on back under the cloak --''  (<font color='red'><b>Hermione/HERMIONE</b></font>)</div>Hermione panted. <div class="bookquote">``Dumbledore
the Minister -- they'll be coming back out in a minute --''

 (<font color='red'><b>an dog</b></font>)</div><p/>But before they could cover themselves again, before they could even
catch their breath, they heard the soft pounding of gigantic paws...
Something was bounding toward them, quiet as a shadow -- an enormous,
pale-eyed, jet-black dog.

<p/>Harry reached for his (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) wand, but too late -- the dog had made an enormous
leap and the front paws hit him (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) on the chest; he (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) keeled over backward in
a whirl of hair; he (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) felt its hot breath, saw inch- long teeth -

<p/>But the force of its leap had carried it too far; it rolled off him (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>).
Dazed, feeling as though his (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) ribs were broken, Harry tried to stand up;
he (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) could hear it growling as it skidded around for a new attack.

<p/>Ron was on his (<font color='blue'><b>Ron</b></font>) feet. As the dog sprang back toward them he (<font color='blue'><b>Ron</b></font>) pushed Harry
aside; the dog's jaws fastened instead around Ron's outstretched arm.
Harry lunged forward, he (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) seized a handful of the brute's hair, but it
was dragging Ron away as easily as though he (<font color='blue'><b>Ron</b></font>) were a rag doll --

<p/>Then, out of nowhere, something hit Harry so hard across the face he (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) was
knocked off his (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) feet again. He (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) heard Hermione shriek with pain and fall
too.

<p/>Harry groped for his (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) wand, blinking blood out of his (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) eyes

<p/>``Lumos!``he (<font color='blue'><b>Ron</b></font>) whispered.

<p/>The wandlight showed him (<font color='blue'><b>Ron</b></font>) the trunk of a thick tree; they had chased
Scabbers into the shadow of the Whomping Willow and its branches were
creaking as though in a high wind, whipping backward and forward to stop
them going nearer.

<p/>And there, at the base of the trunk, was the dog, dragging Ron backward
into a large gap in the roots -- Ron was fighting furiously, but his (<font color='blue'><b>Ron</b></font>)
head and torso were slipping out of sight --

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Ron!''  (<font color='red'><b>Ron</b></font>)</div>Harry shouted, trying to follow, but a heavy branch whipped
lethally through the air and he (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) was forced backward again.

<p/>All they could see now was one of Ron's legs, which he (<font color='blue'><b>Ron</b></font>) had hooked around
a root in an effort to stop the dog from pulling him (<font color='blue'><b>Ron</b></font>) farther underground
-- but a horrible crack cut the air like a gunshot; Ron's leg had
broken, and a moment later, his (<font color='blue'><b>Ron</b></font>) foot vanished from sight.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Harry -- we've got to go for help --''  (<font color='red'><b>Hermione/HERMIONE</b></font>)</div>Hermione gasped; she (<font color='blue'><b>Hermione</b></font>) was bleeding
too; the Willow had cut her (<font color='blue'><b>Hermione</b></font>) across the shoulder.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``No! That thing's big enough to eat him (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>); we haven't got time --''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Harry -- we're never going to get through without help --''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/>Another branch whipped down at them, twigs clenched like knuckles.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``If that dog can get in, we can,''  (<font color='red'><b>Harry/Potter/Harry Potter</b></font>)</div>Harry panted, darting here and there,
trying to find a way through the vicious, swishing branches, but he (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>)
couldn't get an inch nearer to the tree roots without being in range of
the tree's blows.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Oh, help, help,''  (<font color='red'><b>Hermione/HERMIONE</b></font>)</div>Hermione whispered frantically, dancing U._ certainly
on the spot, <div class="bookquote">``Please...''

 (<font color='red'><b>Hermione/HERMIONE</b></font>)</div><p/>Crookshanks darted forward. He (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) slithered between the battering branches
like a snake and placed his (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) front paws upon a knot on the trunk.

<p/>Abruptly, as though the tree had been turned to marble, it stopped
moving. Not a leaf twitched or shook.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Crookshanks!''  (<font color='red'><b>Hermione/HERMIONE</b></font>)</div>Hermione whispered uncertainly. She (<font color='blue'><b>Hermione</b></font>) now grasped Harry's
arm painfully hard. <div class="bookquote">``How did he (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) know --?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``He (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>)'s friends with that dog,''  (<font color='red'><b>Harry/Potter/Harry Potter</b></font>)</div>said Harry grimly. <div class="bookquote">``I've seen them
together. Come on -- and keep your wand out --''

 (<font color='red'><b>Crookshanks</b></font>)</div><p/>They covered the distance to the trunk in seconds, but before they had
reached the gap in the roots, Crookshanks had slid into it with a flick
of his (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) bottlebrush tail. Harry went next; he (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) crawled forward, headfirst,
and slid down an earthy slope to the bottom of a very low tunnel.
Crookshanks was a little way along, his (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) eyes flashing in the light from
Harry's wand. Seconds later, Hermione slithered down beside him (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>).

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Where's Ron?''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Hermione</b></font>) whispered in a terrified voice.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``This way,''  (<font color='red'><b>Harry/Potter/Harry Potter</b></font>)</div>said Harry, setting off, bent-backed, after Crookshanks.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Where does this tunnel come out?''  (<font color='red'><b>Hermione/HERMIONE</b></font>)</div>Hermione asked breathlessly from
behind him (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>).

<p/><div class="bookquote">``I don't know... It's marked on the Marauder's Map but Fred and George
said no one's ever gotten into it... It goes off the edge of the map,
but it looked like it was heading for Hogsmeade...''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/>They moved as fast as they could, bent almost double; ahead of them,
Crookshanks's tail bobbed in and out of view. On and on went the
passage; it felt at least as long as the one to Honeydukes... All Harry
could think of was Ron and what the enormous dog might be doing to
him (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>)... He (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) was drawing breath in sharp, painful gasps, running at a
crouch...

<p/>And then the tunnel began to rise; moments later it twisted, and
Crookshanks had gone. instead, Harry could see a patch of dim light
through a small opening.

<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) and Hermione paused, gasping for breath, edging forward. Both raised
their wands to see what lay beyond.

<p/>It was a room, a very disordered, dusty room. Paper was peeling from the
walls; there were stains all over the floor; every piece of furniture
was broken as though somebody had smashed it. The windows were all
boarded up.

<p/>Harry glanced at Hermione, who looked very frightened but nodded.

<p/>Harry pulled himself out of the hole, staring around. The room was
deserted, but a door to their right stood open, leading to a shadowy
hallway. Hermione suddenly grabbed Harry's arm again. Her (<font color='blue'><b>Hermione</b></font>) wide eyes were
traveling around the boarded windows.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Harry,''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Hermione</b></font>) whispered, <div class="bookquote">``I think we're in the Shrieking Shack.''

 (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div><p/>Harry looked around. His (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) eyes fell on a wooden chair near them. Large
chunks had been torn out of it; one of the legs had been ripped off
entirely.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Ghosts didn't do that,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) said slowly.

<p/>At that moment, there was a creak overhead. Something had Moved
upstairs. Both of them looked up at the ceiling. Hermione's grip on
Harry's arm was so tight he (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) was losing feeling in-his fingers. He (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) raised
his (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) eyebrows at her (<font color='blue'><b>Hermione</b></font>); she (<font color='blue'><b>Hermione</b></font>) nodded again and let go.

<p/>Quietly as they could, they crept out into the hall and UP the crumbling
staircase. Everything was covered in a thick layer of dust except the
floor, where a wide shiny stripe had been made by something being
dragged upstairs.

<p/>They reached the dark landing.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Nox,''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>they whispered together, and the lights at the end of their wands
went out. Only one door was open. As they crept toward it, they heard
movement from behind it; a low moan, and then a deep, loud purring. They
exchanged a last look, a last nod.

<p/>Wand held tightly before him (<font color='blue'><b>their</b></font>), Harry kicked the door wide open.

<p/>On a magnificent four-poster bed with dusty hangings lay Crookshanks,
purring loudly at the sight of them. On the floor beside him (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>), clutching
his (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) leg, which stuck out at a strange angle, was Ron.

<p/>Harry and Hermione dashed across to him (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>).

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Ron -- are you okay?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Where's the dog?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Not a dog,''  (<font color='red'><b>Ron</b></font>)</div>Ron moaned. His (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) teeth were gritted with pain. <div class="bookquote">``Harry, it's
a trap --''

 (<font color='red'><b>Ron</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``What --''

 (<font color='red'><b>Ron</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``He (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>)'s the dog... he (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>)'s an Animagus.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Ron</b></font>)</div><p/>Ron was staring over Harry's shoulder. Harry wheeled around. With a
snap, the man in the shadows closed the door behind them.

<p/>A mass of filthy, matted hair hung to his (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) elbows. If eyes hadn't been
shining out of the deep, dark sockets, he (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) might have been a corpse. The
waxy skin was stretched so tightly over the bones of his (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) face, it looked
like a skull. His (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) yellow teeth were bared in a grin. It was Sirius
Black.

<p/>``Expelliarmus!``he (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) croaked, pointing Ron's wand at them.

<p/>Harry's and Hermione's wands shot out of their hands, high in the air,
and Black caught them. Then he (<font color='blue'><b>Black</b></font>) took a step closer. His (<font color='blue'><b>Black</b></font>) eyes were fixed
on Harry.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``I thought you'd come and help your friend,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Black</b></font>) said hoarsely.

<p/>His (<font color='blue'><b>Black</b></font>) voice sounded as though he (<font color='blue'><b>Black</b></font>) had long since lost the habit of using
it. <div class="bookquote">``Your father would have done the same for me. Brave of you-RRB- not to
run for a teacher. I'm grateful... it will make everything much
easier...''

 (<font color='red'><b>father</b></font>)</div><p/>The taunt about his (<font color='blue'><b>Black</b></font>) father rang in Harry's ears as though Black had
bellowed it. A boiling hate erupted in Harry's chest, leaving no place
for fear. For the first time in his (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) life, he (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) wanted his (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) wand back in his (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>)
hand, not to defend himself, but to attack... to kill. Without knowing
what he (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) was doing, he (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) started forward, but there was a sudden movement
on either side of him (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) and two pairs of hands grabbed him (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) and held him (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>)
back... <div class="bookquote">``No, Harry!''  (<font color='red'><b>him</b></font>)</div>Hermione gasped in a petrified whisper; Ron,
however, spoke to Black.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``If you want to kill Harry, you'll have to kill us too!''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Ron</b></font>) said
fiercely, though the effort of standing upright was draining him (<font color='blue'><b>Ron</b></font>) of
still more color, and he (<font color='blue'><b>Ron</b></font>) swayed slightly as he (<font color='blue'><b>Ron</b></font>) spoke.

<p/>Something flickered in Black's shadowed eyes.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Lie down,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Black</b></font>) said quietly to Ron. <div class="bookquote">``You will damage that leg even
more.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Did you hear me?''  (<font color='red'><b>Ron</b></font>)</div>Ron said weakly, though he (<font color='blue'><b>Ron</b></font>) was clinging painfully to
Harry to stay upright. <div class="bookquote">``You'll have to kill all three of us!''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``There'll be only one murder here tonight,''  (<font color='red'><b>Brack grin</b></font>)</div>said Brack, and his (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) grin
widened.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Why's that?''  (<font color='red'><b>Harry/Potter/Harry Potter</b></font>)</div>Harry spat, trying to wrench himself free of Ron, and
Hermione. <div class="bookquote">``Didn't care last time, did you? Didn't mind slaughtering all
those Muggles to get at Pettigrew... What's the matter, gone soft in
Azkaban?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Harry!''  (<font color='red'><b>Hermione/HERMIONE</b></font>)</div>Hermione whimpered. <div class="bookquote">``Be quiet!''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``HE (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) KILLED MY MUM AND DAD!''  (<font color='red'><b>Harry/Potter/Harry Potter</b></font>)</div>Harry roared, and with a huge effort he (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>)
broke free of Hermione's and Ron's restraint and lunged forward -

<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Ron</b></font>) had forgotten about magic -- he (<font color='blue'><b>Ron</b></font>) had forgotten that he (<font color='blue'><b>Ron</b></font>) was short and
skinny and thirteen, whereas Black was a tall, full-grown man -- all
Harry knew was that he (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) wanted to hurt Black as badly as he (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) could and
that he (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) didn't care how much he (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) got hurt in return --

<p/>Perhaps it was the shock of Harry doing something so stupid, but Black
didn't raise the wands in time -- one of Harry's hands fastened over his (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>)
wasted wrist, forcing the wand tips away; the knuckles of Harry's other
hand collided with the side of Black's head and they fell, backward,
into the wall -

<p/>Hermione was screaming; Ron was yelling; there was a blinding flash as
the wands in Black's hand sent a jet of sparks into the air that missed
Harry's face by inches; Harry felt the shrunken arm under his (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) fingers
twisting madly, but he (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) clung on, his (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) other hand punching every part of
Black it could find.

<p/>But Black's free hand had found Harry's throat

<p/><div class="bookquote">``No,''  (<font color='red'><b>Harry/Potter/Harry Potter</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) hissed, <div class="bookquote">``I've waited too long --''

 (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div><p/>The fingers tightened, Harry choked, his (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) glasses askew.

<p/>Then he (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) saw Hermione's foot swing out of nowhere. Black let go of Harry
with a grunt of pain; Ron had thrown himself on Black's wand hand and
Harry heard a faint clatter --

<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) fought free of the tangle of bodies and saw his (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) own wand rolling
across the floor; he (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) threw himself toward it but

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Argh!''

 (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div><p/>Crookshanks had joined the fray; both sets of front claws had sunk
themselves deep into Harry's arm; Harry threw him (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) off, but Crookshanks
now darted toward Harry's wand --

<p/><div class="bookquote">``NO YOU DON'T!''  (<font color='red'><b>Harry/Potter/Harry Potter</b></font>)</div>roared Harry, and he (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) aimed a kick at Crookshanks that
made the cat leap aside, spitting; Harry snatched up his (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) wand and turned
-

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Get out of the way!''  (<font color='red'><b>Harry/Potter/Harry Potter</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) shouted at Ron and Hermione.

<p/>They didn't need telling twice. Hermione, gasping for breath, her (<font color='blue'><b>Hermione</b></font>) lip
bleeding, scrambled aside, snatching up her (<font color='blue'><b>Hermione</b></font>) and Ron's wands. Ron crawled
to the four-poster and collapsed onto it, panting, his (<font color='blue'><b>Ron</b></font>) white face now
tinged with green, both hands clutching his (<font color='blue'><b>Ron</b></font>) broken leg.

<p/>Black was sprawled at the bottom of the wall. His (<font color='blue'><b>Black</b></font>) thin chest rose and
fell rapidly as he (<font color='blue'><b>Black</b></font>) watched Harry walking slowly nearer, his (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) wand
pointing straight at Black's heart.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Going to kill me, Harry?''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) whispered.

<p/>Harry stopped right above him (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>), his (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) wand still pointing at Black's chest,
looking down at him (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>). A livid bruise was rising around Black's left eye
and his (<font color='blue'><b>Black</b></font>) nose was bleeding.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``You killed my parents,''  (<font color='red'><b>Harry/Potter/Harry Potter</b></font>)</div>said Harry, his (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) voice shaking slightly, but his (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>)
wand hand quite steady.

<p/>Black stared up at him (<font color='blue'><b>Black</b></font>) out of those sunken eyes.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``I don't deny it,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Black</b></font>) said very quietly. <div class="bookquote">``But if you knew the whole
story.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``The whole story?''  (<font color='red'><b>Harry</b></font>)</div>Harry repeated, a furious pounding in his (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) ears. <div class="bookquote">``You
sold them to Voldemort. That's all I need to know.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``You've got to listen to me,''  (<font color='red'><b>Black/Sirius/Sirius Black</b></font>)</div>Black said, and there was a note of
urgency in his (<font color='blue'><b>Black</b></font>) voice now. <div class="bookquote">``You'll regret it if you don't... You don't
understand...''

 (<font color='red'><b>Harry/Potter/Harry Potter</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I understand a lot better than you think,''  (<font color='red'><b>Harry/Potter/Harry Potter</b></font>)</div>said Harry, and his (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) voice
shook more than ever. <div class="bookquote">``You never heard her (<font color='blue'><b>I</b></font>), did you? My mum... trying to
stop Voldemort killing me... and you did that... you did it...''

 (<font color='red'><b>Harry/Potter/Harry Potter</b></font>)</div><p/>Before either of them could say another word, something ginger streaked
past Harry; Crookshanks leapt onto Black's chest and settled himself
there, right over Black's heart. Black blinked and looked down at the
cat.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Get off,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Black</b></font>) murmured, trying to push Crookshanks off him (<font color='blue'><b>Black</b></font>).

<p/>But Crookshanks sank his (<font color='blue'><b>Black</b></font>) claws into Black's robes and wouldn't shift. He (<font color='blue'><b>Black</b></font>)
turned his (<font color='blue'><b>Black</b></font>) ugly, squashed face to Harry and looked up at him (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) with those
great yellow eyes. To his (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) right, Hermione gave a dry sob.

<p/>Harry stared down at Black and Crookshanks, his (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) grip tightening on the
wand. So what if he (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) had to kill the cat too? It was in league with
Black... If it was prepared to die, trying to protect Black, that
wasn't Harry's business... If Black wanted to save it, that only proved
he (<font color='blue'><b>Black</b></font>) cared more for Crookshanks than for Harry's parents...

<p/>Harry raised the wand. Now was the moment to do it. Now was the moment
to avenge his (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) mother and father. He (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) was going to kill Black. He (<font color='blue'><b>Black</b></font>) had to
kill Black. This was his (<font color='blue'><b>Black</b></font>) chance...

<p/>The seconds lengthened. And still Harry stood frozen there, wand poised,
Black staring up at him (<font color='blue'><b>Black</b></font>), Crookshanks on his (<font color='blue'><b>Black</b></font>) chest. Ron's ragged
breathing came from near the bed; Hermione was quite silent.

<p/>And then came a new sound -

<p/>Muffled footsteps were echoing up through the floor -- someone was
moving downstairs.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``WE'RE UP HERE!''  (<font color='red'><b>Hermione/HERMIONE</b></font>)</div>Hermione screamed suddenly. <div class="bookquote">``WE'RE UP HERE -- SIRIUS
BLACK - QUICK!''

 (<font color='red'><b>Black/Sirius/Sirius Black</b></font>)</div><p/>Black made a startled movement that almost dislodged Crookshanks; Harry
gripped his (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) wand convulsively -- Do it now! said a voice in his (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) head --
but the footsteps were thundering up the stairs and Harry still hadn't
done it.

<p/>The door of the room burst open in a shower of red sparks and Harry
wheeled around as Professor Lupin came hurtling into the room, his (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) face
bloodless, his (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) wand raised and ready. His (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) eyes flickered over Ron, lying
on the floor, over Hermione, cowering next to the door, to Harry,
standing there with his (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) wand covering Black, and then to Black himself,
crumpled and bleeding at Harry's feet.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Expelliarmus!''  (<font color='red'><b>Lupin/R. J. Lupin</b></font>)</div>Lupin shouted.

<p/>Harry's wand flew once more out of his (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) hand; so did the two Hermione was
holding. Lupin caught them all deftly, then moved into the room, staring
at Black, who still had Crookshanks lying Protectively across his (<font color='blue'><b>Black</b></font>) chest.

<p/>Harry stood there, feeling suddenly empty. He (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) hadn't done it. His (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) nerve
had failed him (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>). Black was going to be handed back to the dementors.

<p/>Then Lupin spoke, in a very tense voice.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Where is he (<font color='blue'><b>SIRIUS</b></font>), Sirius?''

 (<font color='red'><b>Harry/Potter/Harry Potter</b></font>)</div><p/>Harry looked quickly at Lupin. He (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) didn't understannd what Lupin meant.
Who was Lupin talking about? He (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) turned to look at Black again.

<p/>Black's face was quite expressionless. For a few seconds, he (<font color='blue'><b>Black</b></font>) didn't move
at all. Then, very slowly, he (<font color='blue'><b>Black</b></font>) raised his (<font color='blue'><b>Black</b></font>) empty hand and pointed straight
at Ron. Mystified, Harry glanced around at Ron, who looked bewildered.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``But then...''  (<font color='red'><b>Lupin</b></font>)</div>Lupin muttered, staring at Black so intently it seemed he (<font color='blue'><b>Black</b></font>)
was trying to read his (<font color='blue'><b>Black</b></font>) mind, <div class="bookquote">''... why hasn't he (<font color='blue'><b>Black</b></font>) shown himself before
now? Unless''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>-- Lupin's eyes suddenly widened, as though he (<font color='blue'><b>Black</b></font>) was seeing
something beyond Black, something none of the rest could see, <div class="bookquote">''-- unless
he (<font color='blue'><b>Black</b></font>) was the one... unless you switched... without telling me?''

 (<font color='red'><b>Black something</b></font>)</div><p/>Very slowly, his (<font color='blue'><b>Black</b></font>) sunken gaze never leaving Lupin's face, Black nodded.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Professor,''  (<font color='red'><b>Harry/Potter/Harry Potter</b></font>)</div>Harry interrupted loudly, <div class="bookquote">``what's going on --?''

 (<font color='red'><b>Harry/Potter/Harry Potter</b></font>)</div><p/>But he (<font color='blue'><b>Black</b></font>) never finished the question, because what he (<font color='blue'><b>Black</b></font>) saw made his (<font color='blue'><b>Black</b></font>) voice
die in his (<font color='blue'><b>Black</b></font>) throat. Lupin was lowering his (<font color='blue'><b>Black</b></font>) wand, gazing fixed at Black.
The Professor walked to Black's side, seized his (<font color='blue'><b>Black</b></font>) hand, pulled him (<font color='blue'><b>Black</b></font>) to his (<font color='blue'><b>Black</b></font>)
feet so that Crookshanks fell to the floor, and embraced Black like a
brother.

<p/>Harry felt as though the bottom had dropped out of his (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) stomach.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``DON'T BELIEVE IT!''  (<font color='red'><b>Hermione/HERMIONE</b></font>)</div>Hermione screamed.

<p/>Lupin let go of Black and turned to her (<font color='blue'><b>Hermione</b></font>). She (<font color='blue'><b>Hermione</b></font>) had raised herself off the
floor and was pointing at Lupin, wild-eyed. <div class="bookquote">``You -- you --''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Hermione --''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">''-- you and him (<font color='blue'><b>Black</b></font>)!''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Hermione, calm down --''

 (<font color='red'><b>Hermione/HERMIONE</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I didn't tell anyone!''  (<font color='red'><b>Hermione/HERMIONE</b></font>)</div>Hermione shrieked. <div class="bookquote">``I've been covering up for
you --''

 (<font color='red'><b>Lupin/R. J. Lupin</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Hermione, listen to me, please'''  (<font color='red'><b>Lupin/R. J. Lupin</b></font>)</div>Lupin shouted. <div class="bookquote">``I can explain --''

 (<font color='red'><b>Harry/Potter/Harry Potter</b></font>)</div><p/>Harry could feel himself shaking, not with fear, but with a fresh wave
of fury.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``I trusted you,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) shouted at Lupin, his (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) voice wavering, out of
control, <div class="bookquote">``and all the time you've been his (<font color='blue'><b>Professor</b></font>) friend!''

 (<font color='red'><b>Lupin</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``You're wrong,''  (<font color='red'><b>Lupin/R. J. Lupin</b></font>)</div>said Lupin. <div class="bookquote">``I haven't been Sirius's friend, but I am
now -- Let me explain...''

 (<font color='red'><b>Hermione/HERMIONE</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``NO!''  (<font color='red'><b>Hermione/HERMIONE</b></font>)</div>Hermione screamed. <div class="bookquote">``Harry, don't trust him (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>), he (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>)'s been helping
Black get into the castle, he (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) wants you dead too -- he (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>)'s a werewolf!''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/>There was a ringing silence. Everyone's eyes were now on Lupin, who
looked remarkably calm, though rather pale.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Not at all up to your usual standard, Hermione,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) said. ``Only one out
of three, I'm afraid. I have not been helping Sirius get into the castle
and I certainly don't want Harry dead. An odd shiver passed over his (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>)
face. <div class="bookquote">``But I won't deny that I am a werewolf.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Ron</b></font>)</div><p/>Ron made a valiant effort to get up again but fell back with a whimper
of pain. Lupin made toward him (<font color='blue'><b>Ron</b></font>), looking concerned, but Ron gasped, <div class="bookquote">``Get
away ftom me, werewolf!''

 (<font color='red'><b>Ron</b></font>)</div><p/>Lupin stopped dead. Then, with an obvious effort, he (<font color='blue'><b>Ron</b></font>) turned to Hermione
and said, <div class="bookquote">``How long have you known?''

 (<font color='red'><b>Hermione/HERMIONE</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Ages,''  (<font color='red'><b>Hermione/HERMIONE</b></font>)</div>Hermione whispered. <div class="bookquote">``Since I did Professor Snape's essay...''

 (<font color='red'><b>Lupin/R. J. Lupin</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``He (<font color='blue'><b>Professor</b></font>)'ll be delighted,''  (<font color='red'><b>Lupin/R. J. Lupin</b></font>)</div>said Lupin coolly. <div class="bookquote">``He (<font color='blue'><b>Professor</b></font>) assigned that essay hoping
someone would realize what my symptoms meant... Did you check the lunar
chart and realize that I was always ill at the full moon? Or did you
realize that the boggart changed into the moon when it saw me?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Both,''  (<font color='red'><b>Hermione/HERMIONE</b></font>)</div>Hermione said quietly.

<p/>Lupin forced a laugh.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``You're the cleverest witch of your age I've ever met, Hermione.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I'm not,''  (<font color='red'><b>Hermione/HERMIONE</b></font>)</div>Hermione whispered. <div class="bookquote">``If I'd been a bit cleverer, I'd have
told everyone what you are!''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``But they already know,''  (<font color='red'><b>Lupin/R. J. Lupin</b></font>)</div>said Lupin. <div class="bookquote">``At least, the staff do.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/>``Dumbledore hired you when he (<font color='blue'><b>Dumbledore</b></font>) knew you were a werewolf. Ron gasped. <div class="bookquote">``Is
he (<font color='blue'><b>Ron</b></font>) mad?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Some of the staff thought so,''  (<font color='red'><b>Lupin/R. J. Lupin</b></font>)</div>said Lupin. <div class="bookquote">``He (<font color='blue'><b>Ron</b></font>) had to work very hard to
convince certain teachers that I'm trustworthy --''

 (<font color='red'><b>Harry/Potter/Harry Potter</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``AND HE (<font color='blue'><b>Ron</b></font>) WAS WRONG!''  (<font color='red'><b>Harry/Potter/Harry Potter</b></font>)</div>Harry yelled. <div class="bookquote">``YOUVE BEEN HELPING HIM ALL THE TIME!''
 (<font color='red'><b>He</b></font>)</div>He (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) was pointing at Black, who suddenly crossed to the four-poster bed
and sank onto it, his (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) face hidden in one shaking hand. Crookshanks leapt
up beside him (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) and stepped onto his (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) lap, purring. Ron edged away from
both of them, dragging his (<font color='blue'><b>Ron</b></font>) leg.

<p/>I have not been helping Sirius,'' said Lupin. <div class="bookquote">``If you'll give me a
chance, I'll explain. Look --''

 (<font color='red'><b>He</b></font>)</div><p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Sirius</b></font>) separated Harry's, Ron's and Hermione's wands and threw each back to
its owner; Harry caught his (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>), stunned.

<p/>There, said Lupin, sticking his (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) own wand back into his (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) belt <div class="bookquote">``You're
armed, we're not. Now will you listen?''

 (<font color='red'><b>Lupin/R. J. Lupin</b></font>)</div><p/>Harry didn't know what to think. Was it a trick?

<p/><div class="bookquote">``If you haven't been helping him (<font color='blue'><b>Ron</b></font>),''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) said, with a furious glance at
Black, <div class="bookquote">``how did you know he (<font color='blue'><b>Ron</b></font>) was here?''

 (<font color='red'><b>Black</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``The map,''  (<font color='red'><b>Lupin/R. J. Lupin</b></font>)</div>said Lupin. <div class="bookquote">``The Marauder's Map. I was in my office examining

 (<font color='red'><b>Harry/Potter/Harry Potter</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``You know how to work it?''  (<font color='red'><b>Harry/Potter/Harry Potter</b></font>)</div>Harry said suspiciously.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Of course I know how to work it,''  (<font color='red'><b>Lupin/R. J. Lupin</b></font>)</div>said Lupin, waving his (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) hand
impatiently. <div class="bookquote">``I helped write it. I'm Moony -- that was my friends'

 (<font color='red'><b>He</b></font>)</div><p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) had started to pace up and down, looking at them. Little patches of
dust rose at his (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) feet.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``You might have been wearing your father's old cloak, Harry--''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``How d'you know about the cloak?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``The number of times I saw James disappearing under it...,''  (<font color='red'><b>Lupin/R. J. Lupin</b></font>)</div>said Lupin,
waving an impatient hand again. <div class="bookquote">``The point is, even if you're wearing an
Invisibility Cloak, you still show up on the Marauder's Map. I watched
you cross the grounds and enter Hagrid's hut. Twenty minutes later, you

accompanied by somebody else.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``What?''  (<font color='red'><b>Harry/Potter/Harry Potter</b></font>)</div>said Harry. <div class="bookquote">``No, we weren't!''

Harry's interruption. ``I thought the map must be malfunctioning. How
could he (<font color='blue'><b>James</b></font>) be with you?'' <div class="bookquote">``No one was with us!''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>said Harry.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``And then I saw another dot, moving fast toward you, labeled Sirius

 (<font color='red'><b>Ron</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``One of us!''  (<font color='red'><b>Ron</b></font>)</div>Ron said angrily.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``No, Ron,''  (<font color='red'><b>Lupin/R. J. Lupin</b></font>)</div>said Lupin. <div class="bookquote">``Two of you.''

 (<font color='red'><b>He</b></font>)</div><p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) had stopped his (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) pacing, his (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) eyes moving over Ron.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Do you think I could have a look at the rat?''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Ron</b></font>) said evenly.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``What?''  (<font color='red'><b>Ron</b></font>)</div>said Ron. <div class="bookquote">``What's Scabbers got to do with it?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Everything,''  (<font color='red'><b>Lupin/R. J. Lupin</b></font>)</div>said Lupin. <div class="bookquote">``Could I see him (<font color='blue'><b>Ron</b></font>), please?''

 (<font color='red'><b>Ron</b></font>)</div><p/>Ron hesitated, then put a hand inside his (<font color='blue'><b>Ron</b></font>) robes. Scabbers emerged,
thrashing desperately; Ron had to seize his (<font color='blue'><b>Ron</b></font>) long bald tail to stop him (<font color='blue'><b>Ron</b></font>)
escaping. Crookshanks stood up on Black's leg and made a soft hissing
noise.

<p/>Lupin moved closer to Ron. He (<font color='blue'><b>Ron</b></font>) seemed to be holding his (<font color='blue'><b>Ron</b></font>) breath as he (<font color='blue'><b>Ron</b></font>)
gazed intently at Scabbers.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``What?''  (<font color='red'><b>Ron</b></font>)</div>Ron said again, holding Scabbers close to him (<font color='blue'><b>Ron</b></font>), looking scared.
<div class="bookquote">``What's my rat got to do with anything?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``That's not a rat,''  (<font color='red'><b>Black/Sirius/Sirius Black</b></font>)</div>croaked Sirius Black suddenly.

<p/>MOONY, WORMTAIL, PADDFOOT, AND PRONGS

<p/>It took a few seconds for the absurdity of this statement to sink in.
Then Ron voiced what Harry was thinking.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``You're both mental.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Ridiculous!''  (<font color='red'><b>Hermione/HERMIONE</b></font>)</div>said Hermione faintly.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Peter Pettigrew's dead!''  (<font color='red'><b>Harry/Potter/Harry Potter</b></font>)</div>said Harry. <div class="bookquote">``He (<font color='blue'><b>Pettigrew</b></font>) killed him (<font color='blue'><b>Pettigrew</b></font>) twelve years ago!''
 (<font color='red'><b>He</b></font>)</div>He (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) pointed at Black, whose face twitched convulsively.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``I meant to,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) growled, his (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) yellow teeth bared, <div class="bookquote">``but little Peter got
the better of me... not this time, though!''

 (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div><p/>And Crookshanks was thrown to the floor as Black lunged at Scabbers; Ron
yelled with pain as Black's weight fell on his (<font color='blue'><b>Ron</b></font>) broken leg.

<p/>.<div class="bookquote">``Sirius, NO!''  (<font color='red'><b>Lupin/R. J. Lupin</b></font>)</div>Lupin yelled, launching himself forwards and dragging
Black away from Ron again, <div class="bookquote">``WAIT! You can't do it just like that -- they
need to understand -- we've got to explain --''

 (<font color='red'><b>Ron</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``We can explain afterwards!''  (<font color='red'><b>Black/Sirius/Sirius Black</b></font>)</div>snarled Black, trying to throw Lupin off.
One hand was still clawing the air as it tried to reach Scabbers, who
was squealing like a piglet, scratching Ron's face and neck as he (<font color='blue'><b>Ron</b></font>) tried
to escape.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``They've -- got -- a -- right -- to -- know -- -everything!''  (<font color='red'><b>Lupin/R. J. Lupin</b></font>)</div>Lupin
panted, still trying to restrain Black. <div class="bookquote">``Ron's kept him (<font color='blue'><b>Ron</b></font>) as a pet! There
are parts of it even I don't understand, and Harry -- you owe Harry the
truth, Sirius!''

 (<font color='red'><b>Black/Sirius/Sirius Black</b></font>)</div><p/>Black stopped struggling, though his (<font color='blue'><b>Black</b></font>) hollowed eyes were still fixed on
Scabbers, who was clamped tightly under Ron's bitten, scratched, ad
bleeding hands.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``All right, then,''  (<font color='red'><b>Black/Sirius/Sirius Black</b></font>)</div>Black said, without taking his (<font color='blue'><b>Black</b></font>) eyes off the rat.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Tell them whatever you like. But make it quick, Remus. I want to commit
the murder I was imprisoned for...''

 (<font color='red'><b>Ron</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``You're nutters, both of you,''  (<font color='red'><b>Ron</b></font>)</div>said Ron shakily, looking round at Harry
and Hermione for support. <div class="bookquote">``I've had enough of this. I'm off.''

 (<font color='red'><b>He</b></font>)</div><p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Ron</b></font>) tried to heave himself up on his (<font color='blue'><b>Ron</b></font>) good leg, but Lupin raised his (<font color='blue'><b>Ron</b></font>) wand
again, pointing it at Scabbers.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``You're going to hear me out, Ron,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Ron</b></font>) said quietly. <div class="bookquote">``Just keep a tight
hold on Peter while you listen.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/>``HE (<font color='blue'><b>Ron</b></font>)'S NOT PETER, HE (<font color='blue'><b>Ron</b></font>)<div class="bookquote">``S SCABBERS!''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>Ron yelled, trying to fore the rat back
into his (<font color='blue'><b>Ron</b></font>) front pocket, but Scabbers was fighting to hard; Ron swayed and
overbalanced, and Harry caught him (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) am pushed him (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) back down to the bed.
Then, ignoring Black, Harry turned to Lupin.

<p/>There were witnesses who saw Pettigrew die,'' he (<font color='blue'><b>Pettigrew</b></font>) said. <div class="bookquote">``A whole street
full of them...''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``They didn't see what they thought they saw!''  (<font color='red'><b>Black/Sirius/Sirius Black</b></font>)</div>said Black savagely, still
watching Scabbers struggling in Ron's hands.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Everyone thought Sirius killed Peter,''  (<font color='red'><b>Lupin/R. J. Lupin</b></font>)</div>said Lupin, nodding. <div class="bookquote">``I believed
it myself -- until I saw the map tonight. Because the Marauder's map
never lies... Peter's alive. Ron's holding him (<font color='blue'><b>Ron</b></font>), Harry.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Harry/Potter/Harry Potter</b></font>)</div><p/>Harry looked down at Ron, and as their eyes met, they agreed, silently:
Black and Lupin were both out of their minds. Their story made no sense
whatsoever. How could Scabbers be Peter Pettigrew? Azkaban must have
unhinged Black after all -- but why was Lupin playing along with him (<font color='blue'><b>Pettigrew</b></font>)?

<p/>Then Hermione spoke, in a trembling, would-be calm sort of voice, as
though trying to will Professor Lupin to talk sensibly.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``But Professor Lupin... Scabbers can't be Pettigrew... it just can't be
true, you know it can't...''

 (<font color='red'><b>Lupin/R. J. Lupin</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Why can't it be true?''  (<font color='red'><b>Lupin/R. J. Lupin</b></font>)</div>Lupin said calmly, as though they were in class,
and Hermione had simply spotted a problem in an experiment with
grindylows.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Because... because people would know if Peter Pettigrew had been an
Animagus. We did Animagi in class with Professor McGonagall. And I
looked them up when I did my homework -- the Ministry of Magic keeps
tabs on witches and wizards who can become animals; there's a register
showing what animal they become, and their markings and things... and I
went and looked Professor McGonagall up on the register, and there have
been only seven Animagi this century, and Pettigrew's name wasn't on the
list.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Harry/Potter/Harry Potter</b></font>)</div><p/>Harry had barely had time to marvel inwardly at the effort Hermione put
into her (<font color='blue'><b>Hermione</b></font>) homework, when Lupin started to laugh.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Light again, Hermione!''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) said. <div class="bookquote">``But the Ministry never knew that here
used to be three unregistered Animagi running around Hogwarts.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I you're going to tell them the story, get a move on, Remus,''  (<font color='red'><b>Black/Sirius/Sirius Black</b></font>)</div>said
Black, who was still watching Scabbers's every desperate move. <div class="bookquote">``I've
waited twelve years, I'm not going to wait much longer.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``All right... but you'll need to help me, Sirius,''  (<font color='red'><b>Lupin/R. J. Lupin</b></font>)</div>said Lupin, I only
know how it began...''

<p/>Lupin broke off. There had been a loud creak behind him (<font color='blue'><b>Black</b></font>). The bedroom
door had opened of its own accord. All five of them stared at it. Then
Lupin strode toward it and looked out into the landing.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``No one there...''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``This place is haunted!''  (<font color='red'><b>Ron</b></font>)</div>said Ron.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``It's not,''  (<font color='red'><b>Lupin/R. J. Lupin</b></font>)</div>said Lupin, still looking at the door in a puzzled way. <div class="bookquote">``The
Shrieking Shack was never haunted... The screams and howls the
villagers used to hear were made by me.''

 (<font color='red'><b>He</b></font>)</div><p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Ron</b></font>) pushed his (<font color='blue'><b>Ron</b></font>) graying hair out of his (<font color='blue'><b>Ron</b></font>) eyes, thought for a moment then
said, <div class="bookquote">``That's where all of this starts -- with my becoming a werewolf,
None of this could have happened if I hadn't been bitter... and if I
hadn't been so foolhardy...''

 (<font color='red'><b>He</b></font>)</div><p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Ron</b></font>) looked sober and tired. Ron started to interrupt, but Hermione, said,
<div class="bookquote">``Shh!''  (<font color='red'><b>Hermione/HERMIONE</b></font>)</div>She (<font color='blue'><b>Hermione</b></font>) was watching Lupin very intently.

<p/>``I as a very small boy when I received the bite. My parents tried
everything, but in those days there was no cure. The potion that
Professor Snape has been making for me is a very recent discovery. It
makes me safe, you see. As long as I take it in the week, preceding the
full moon, I keep my mind when I transform... I'm able to curl up in my
office, a harmless wolf, and wait for the moon to wane again.

<p/>``Before the Wolfsbane Potion was discovered, however, I became a fully
fledged monster once a month. It seemed impossible that I would be able
to come to Hogwarts. Other parents weren't likely to want their children
exposed to me.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``But then Dumbledore became Headmaster, and he (<font color='blue'><b>Dumbledore</b></font>) was sympathetic. He (<font color='blue'><b>Dumbledore</b></font>) said
that as long as we took certain precautions, there was no reason I
shouldn't come to school...''  (<font color='red'><b>Lupin/R. J. Lupin</b></font>)</div>Lupin sighed, and looked directly at
Harry. <div class="bookquote">``I told you, months ago, that the Whomping Willow was planted the
year I came to Hogwarts. The truth is that it was planted because I came
to Hogwarts. This house''  (<font color='red'><b>Lupin/R. J. Lupin</b></font>)</div>-- Lupin looked miserably around the room, --
<div class="bookquote">``the tunnel that leads to it -- they were built for my use. Once a
month, I was smuggled out of the castle, into this place, to transform.
The tree was placed at the tunnel mouth to stop anyone coming across me
while I was dangerous.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Lupin/R. J. Lupin</b></font>)</div><p/>Harry couldn't see where this story was going, but he (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) was listening
raptly all the same. The only sound apart from Lupin's voice was
Scabbers's frightened squeaking.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``My transformations in those days were -- were terrible. It is very
painful to turn into a werewolf. I was separated from humans to bite, so
I bit and scratched myself instead. The villagers heard the noise and
the screaming and thought they were hearing particularly violent
spirits. Dumbledore encouraged the rumor... Even now, when the house
has been silent for years, the villagers don't dare approach it...''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``But apart from my transformations, I was happier than I had ever been
in my life. For the first time ever, I had friends, three great friends.
Sirius Black... Peter Pettigrew... and, of course, your father, Harry --
James Potter.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Now, my three friends could hardly fail to notice that I disappeared
once a month. I made up all sorts of stories. I told them my mother was
ill, and that I had to go home to see her (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>)... I was terrified they would
desert me the moment they found out what I was. But of course, they,
like you, Hermione, worked out the truth...''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``And they didn't desert me at all. Instead, they did something for me
that would make my transformations not only bearable, but the best times
of my life. They became Animagi.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``My dad too?''  (<font color='red'><b>Harry/Potter/Harry Potter</b></font>)</div>said Harry, astounded.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Yes, indeed,''  (<font color='red'><b>Lupin/R. J. Lupin</b></font>)</div>said Lupin. <div class="bookquote">``It took them the best part of three years to
work out how to do it. Your father and Sirius here were the cleverest
students in the school, and lucky they were, because the Animagus
transformation can go horribly wrong -- one reason the Ministry keeps a
close watch on those attempting to do it. Peter needed all the help he (<font color='blue'><b>Peter</b></font>)
could get from James and Sirius. Finally, in our fifth year, they
managed it. They could each turn into a different animal at will.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``But how did that help you?''  (<font color='red'><b>Hermione/HERMIONE</b></font>)</div>said Hermione, sounding puzzled.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``They couldn't keep me company as humans, so they kept me company as
animals,''  (<font color='red'><b>Lupin/R. J. Lupin</b></font>)</div>said Lupin. <div class="bookquote">``A werewolf is only a danger to people. They
sneaked out of the castle every month under James's Invisibility Cloak.
They transformed... Peter, as the smallest, could slip beneath the
Willow's attacking branches and touch the knot that freezes it. They
would then slip down the tunnel and join me. Under their influence, I
became less dangerous. My body was still wolfish, but my mind seemed to
become less so while I was with them.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Hurry up, Remus,''  (<font color='red'><b>Black/Sirius/Sirius Black</b></font>)</div>snarled Black, who was still watching Scabbers with a
horrible sort of hunger on his (<font color='blue'><b>Black</b></font>) face.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``I'm getting there, Sirius, I'm getting there... well, highly exciting
possibilities were open to us now that we could all transform. Soon we
were leaving the Shrieking Shack and roaming the school grounds and the
village by night. Sirius and James transformed into such large animals,
they were able to keep a werewolf in check. I doubt whether any Hogwarts
students ever found out more about the Hogwarts grounds and Hogsmeade
than we did... And that's how we came to write the Marauder's Map, and
sign it with our nicknames. Sirius is Padfoot. Peter is Wormtail. James
was Prongs.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``What sort of animal --?''  (<font color='red'><b>Harry/Potter/Harry Potter</b></font>)</div>Harry began, but Hermione cut him (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) off.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``That was still really dangerous! Running around in the dark with a
werewolf! What if you'd given the others the slip, and bitten somebody?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``A thought that still haunts me,''  (<font color='red'><b>Lupin/R. J. Lupin</b></font>)</div>said Lupin heavily. <div class="bookquote">``And there were
near misses, many of them. We laughed about them afterwards. We were
young, thoughtless -- carried away with our own cleverness.''

 (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div><p/>I sometimes felt guilty about betraying Dumbledore's trust, of course...
he (<font color='blue'><b>Dumbledore</b></font>) had admitted me to Hogwarts when no other headmaster would have done
so, and he (<font color='blue'><b>headmaster</b></font>) had no idea I was breaking the rules he (<font color='blue'><b>headmaster</b></font>) had set down for my
own and others' safety. He (<font color='blue'><b>headmaster</b></font>) never knew I had led three fellow students
into becoming Animagi illegally. But I always managed to forget my
guilty feelings every time we sat down to plan our next month's
adventure. And I haven't changed...''

<p/>Lupin's face had hardened, and there was self-disgust in his (<font color='blue'><b>headmaster</b></font>) voice. <div class="bookquote">``All
this year, I have been battling with myself, wondering whether I should
tell Dumbledore that Sirius was an Animagus. But I didn't do it. Why?
Because I was too cowardly. It would have meant admitting that I'd
betrayed his (<font color='blue'><b>Sirius</b></font>) trust while I was at school, admitting that I'd led others
along with me... and Dumbledore's trust has meant everything to me. He (<font color='blue'><b>Dumbledore</b></font>)
let me into Hogwarts as a boy, and he (<font color='blue'><b>Hogwarts</b></font>) gave me a job when I have been
shunned all my adult life, unable to find paid work because of what I
am. And so I convinced myself that Sirius was getting into the school
using dark arts he (<font color='blue'><b>Sirius</b></font>) learned from Voldemort, that being an Animagus had
nothing to do with it... so, in a way, Snape's been right about me all
along.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Snape?''  (<font color='red'><b>Black/Sirius/Sirius Black</b></font>)</div>said Black harshly, taking his (<font color='blue'><b>headmaster</b></font>) eyes off Scabbers; for the first

it?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``He (<font color='blue'><b>Snape</b></font>)'s here, Sirius,''  (<font color='red'><b>Lupin/R. J.

reasons... you see, Sirius here played a trick on him (<font color='blue'><b>Sirius</b></font>) which nearly
killed him (<font color='blue'><b>Sirius</b></font>), a trick which involved me --''

<p/><div class="bookquote">``It served him (<font color='blue'><b>Sirius</b></font>) right,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Black</b></font>) sneered. <div class="bookquote">``Sneaking around, trying to find out

Harry, Ron, and Hermione. <div class="bookquote">``We were in the same year, you know, and we --
er -- didn't like each other very much. He (<font color='blue'><b>Severus</b></font>) especially disliked James.
Jealous, I think, of James's talent on the Quidditch field... anyway
Snape had seen me crossing the grounds with Madam Pomfrey one evening as
she (<font color='blue'><b>Pomfrey</b></font>) led me toward the Whomping Willow to transform. Sirius thought it
would be -- er -- amusing, to tell Snape all he (<font color='blue'><b>Snape</b></font>) had to do was prod the
knot on the tree trunk with a long stick, and he (<font color='blue'><b>Snape</b></font>)'d be able to get in
after me. Well, of course, Snape tried it -- if he (<font color='blue'><b>Snape</b></font>)'d got as far as this
house, he (<font color='blue'><b>Snape</b></font>)'d have met a fully grown werewolf -- but your father, who'd
heard what Sirius had done, went after Snape and pulled him (<font color='blue'><b>Snape</b></font>) back, at
great risk to his (<font color='blue'><b>Snape</b></font>) life... Snape glimpsed me, though, at the end of the
tunnel. He (<font color='blue'><b>Snape</b></font>) was forbidden by Dumbledore to tell anybody, but from that
time on he (<font color='blue'><b>Snape</b></font>) knew what I was...''

 (<font color='red'><b>Harry/Potter/Harry Potter</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``So that's why Snape doesn't like you,''  (<font color='red'><b>Harry/Potter/Harry Potter</b></font>)</div>said Harry slowly, <div class="bookquote">``because he (<font color='blue'><b>Snape</b></font>)

 (<font color='red'><b>Harry/Potter/Harry Potter</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``That's right,''  (<font color='red'><b>Lupin</b></font>)</div>sneered a cold voice from the wall behind Lupin.

directly at Lupin.

<p/>Hermione screamed. Black leapt to his (<font color='blue'><b>Snape</b></font>) feet. Harry felt as though he (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>)'d
received a huge electric shock.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``I found this at the base of the Whomping Willow,''  (<font color='red'><b>Snape/Severus/Severus Snape</b></font>)</div>said Snape, throwing

I did... lucky for me, I mean. Lying on your desk was a certain map. One

passageway and out of sight.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Severus --''  (<font color='red'><b>Lupin/R. J. Lupin</b></font>)</div>Lupin began, but Snape overrode him (<font color='blue'><b>Snape</b></font>).

<p/><div class="bookquote">``I've told the headmaster again and again that you're helping your old
friend Black into the castle, Lupin, and here's the proof. Not even I
dreamed you would have the nerve to use this old place as your hideout

 (<font color='red'><b>Lupin/R. J. Lupin</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Severus, you're making a mistake,''  (<font color='red'><b>Lupin/R. J. Lupin</b></font>)</div>said Lupin urgently. <div class="bookquote">``You haven't

 (<font color='red'><b>Snape/Severus/Severus Snape</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Two more for Azkaban tonight,''  (<font color='red'><b>Snape/Severus/Severus Snape</b></font>)</div>said Snape, his (<font color='blue'><b>Snape</b></font>) eyes now gleaming
fanatically. <div class="bookquote">``I shall be interested to see how Dumbledore takes this...
He (<font color='blue'><b>Dumbledore</b></font>) was quite convinced you were harmless, you know, Lupin... a tame

 (<font color='red'><b>Lupin/R. J. Lupin</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``You fool,''  (<font color='red'><b>Lupin/R. J. Lupin</b></font>)</div>said Lupin softly. <div class="bookquote">``Is a schoolboy grudge worth putting an
innocent man back inside Azkaban?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/>BANG! Thin, snakelike cords burst from the end of Snape's wand and
twisted themselves around Lupin's mouth, wrists, and ankles; he (<font color='blue'><b>Snape</b></font>)
overbalanced and fell to the floor, unable to move. With a roar of rage,
Black started toward Snape, but Snape pointed his (<font color='blue'><b>Snape</b></font>) wand straight between
Black's eyes.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Give me a reason,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Snape</b></font>) whispered. <div class="bookquote">``Give me a reason to do it, and I
swear I will.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/>Black stopped dead. It would have been impossible to say which face
showed more hatred.

<p/>Harry stood there, paralyzed, not knowing what to do or whom to believe.
He (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) glanced around at Ron and Hermione. Ron looked just as confused as he (<font color='blue'><b>Ron</b></font>)
did, still fighting to keep hold on the struggling Scabbers. Hermione,
however, took an uncertain step toward Snape and said, in a very
breathless voice, <div class="bookquote">``Professor Snape -- it it wouldn't hurt to hear what
they've got to say, w -- would it?''

 (<font color='red'><b>Snape/Severus/Severus Snape</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Miss Granger, you are already facing suspension from this school,''
 (<font color='red'><b>Snape/Severus/Severus Snape</b></font>)</div>Snape spat. <div class="bookquote">``You, Potter, and Weasley are out-of-bounds, in the company
of a convicted murderer and a werewolf. For once in your life, hold your
tongue.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``But if -- if there was a mistake --''

 (<font color='red'><b>Snape/Severus/Severus Snape</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``KEEP QUIET, YOU STUPID GIRL!''  (<font color='red'><b>Snape/Severus/Severus Snape</b></font>)</div>Snape shouted, looking suddenly quite
deranged. ``DON'T TALK ABOUT WHAT YOU DON<div class="bookquote">``T UNDERSTAND!''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>A few sparks
shot out of the end of his (<font color='blue'><b>Snape</b></font>) wand, which was still pointed at Black's
face. Hermione fell silent.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Vengeance is very sweet,''  (<font color='red'><b>Snape/Severus/Severus Snape</b></font>)</div>Snape breathed at Black. <div class="bookquote">``How I hoped I would
be the one to catch you...''

 (<font color='red'><b>Black</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``The joke's on you again, Severus,''  (<font color='red'><b>Black</b></font>)</div>Black snarled. <div class="bookquote">``As long as this boy

 (<font color='red'><b>Ron</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Up to the castle?''  (<font color='red'><b>Ron</b></font>)</div>said Snape silkily. <div class="bookquote">``I don't think we need to go

 (<font color='red'><b>Blacks</b></font>)</div><p/>What little color there was in Blacks face left it.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``You -you've got to hear me out,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Snape</b></font>) croaked. <div class="bookquote">``The rat -- look at the
rat --''

 (<font color='red'><b>Snape/Severus/Severus Snape</b></font>)</div><p/>But there was a mad glint in Snape's eyes that Harry had never seen
before. He (<font color='blue'><b>Snape</b></font>) seemed beyond reason.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Come on, all of you,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Snape</b></font>) said. He (<font color='blue'><b>Snape</b></font>) clicked his (<font color='blue'><b>Snape</b></font>) fingers, and the ends of
the cords that bound Lupin flew to his (<font color='blue'><b>Snape</b></font>) hands. <div class="bookquote">``I'll drag the werewolf.
Perhaps the dementors will have a kiss for him (<font color='blue'><b>Black</b></font>) too --''

 (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div><p/>Before he (<font color='blue'><b>Snape</b></font>) knew what he (<font color='blue'><b>Snape</b></font>) was doing, Harry had crossed the room in three
strides and blocked the door.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Get out of the way, Potter, you're in enough trouble already,''  (<font color='red'><b>Snape/Severus/Severus Snape</b></font>)</div>snarled
Snape. <div class="bookquote">``If I hadn't been here to save your skin --''

 (<font color='red'><b>Harry/Potter/Harry Potter</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Professor Lupin could have killed me about a hundred times this year,''
 (<font color='red'><b>Harry/Potter/Harry Potter</b></font>)</div>Harry said. <div class="bookquote">``I've been alone with him (<font color='blue'><b>Professor</b></font>) loads of times, having defense
lessons against the dementors. If he (<font color='blue'><b>Professor</b></font>) was helping Black, why didn't he (<font color='blue'><b>Black</b></font>)
just finish me off then?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Don't ask me to fathom the way a werewolf's mind works,''  (<font color='red'><b>Snape/Severus/Severus Snape</b></font>)</div>hissed Snape.
<div class="bookquote">``Get out of the way, Potter.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``YOURE PATHETIC!''  (<font color='red'><b>Harry/Potter/Harry Potter</b></font>)</div>Harry yelled. ``JUST BECAUSE THEY MADE A FOOL OF YOU AT
SCHOOL YOU WON<div class="bookquote">``T EVEN LISTEN --''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``SILENCE! I WILL NOT BE SPOKEN TO LIKE THAT!''  (<font color='red'><b>Snape/Severus/Severus Snape</b></font>)</div>Snape shrieked, looking
madder than ever. <div class="bookquote">``Like father, like son, Potter! I have just saved your

arrogant to believe you might be mistaken in Black -- now get out of the
way, or I will make you. GET OUT OF THE WAY, POTTER!''

 (<font color='red'><b>Harry/Potter/Harry Potter</b></font>)</div><p/>Harry made up his (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) mind in a split second. Before Snape could take even
one step toward him (<font color='blue'><b>Snape</b></font>), he (<font color='blue'><b>Snape</b></font>) had raised his (<font color='blue'><b>Snape</b></font>) wand.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Expelliarmus!''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Snape</b></font>) yelled -- except that his (<font color='blue'><b>Snape</b></font>) wasn't the only voice that
shouted. There was a blast that made the door rattle on its hinges;
Snape was lifted off his (<font color='blue'><b>Snape</b></font>) feet and slammed into the wall, then slid down
it to the floor, a trickle of blood oozing from under his (<font color='blue'><b>Snape</b></font>) hair. He (<font color='blue'><b>Snape</b></font>) had
been knocked out.

<p/>Harry looked around. Both Ron and Hermione had tried to disarm Snape at
exactly the same moment. Snape's wand soared in a high arc and landed on
the bed next to Crookshanks.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``You shouldn't have done that,''  (<font color='red'><b>Black/Sirius/Sirius Black</b></font>)</div>said Black, looking at Harry.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``You should have left him (<font color='blue'><b>POTTER</b></font>) to me...''

 (<font color='red'><b>Harry/Potter/Harry Potter</b></font>)</div><p/>Harry avoided Black's eyes. He (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) wasn't sure, even now, that he (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>)'d done the
right thing.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``We attacked a teacher... We attacked a teacher...''  (<font color='red'><b>Hermione/HERMIONE</b></font>)</div>Hermione whimpered,
staring at the lifeless Snape with frightened eyes. <div class="bookquote">``Oh, we're going to
be in so much trouble --''

 (<font color='red'><b>Lupin/R. J. Lupin</b></font>)</div><p/>Lupin was struggling against his (<font color='blue'><b>Snape</b></font>) bonds. Black bent down quickly and
untied him (<font color='blue'><b>Snape</b></font>). Lupin straightened up, rubbing his (<font color='blue'><b>Snape</b></font>) arms where the ropes had
cut into them.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Thank you, Harry,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Snape</b></font>) said.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``I'm still not saying I believe you,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Snape</b></font>) told Lupin.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Then it's time we offered you some proof,''  (<font color='red'><b>Lupin/R. J. Lupin</b></font>)</div>said Lupin. <div class="bookquote">``You, boy --
give me Peter, please. Now.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Ron</b></font>)</div><p/>Ron clutched Scabbers closer to his (<font color='blue'><b>Ron</b></font>) chest.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Come off it,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Ron</b></font>) said weakly. <div class="bookquote">``Are you trying to say he (<font color='blue'><b>Peter</b></font>) broke out of
Azkaban just to get his (<font color='blue'><b>Peter</b></font>) hands on Scabbers? I mean...''  (<font color='red'><b>He</b></font>)</div>He (<font color='blue'><b>Ron</b></font>) looked up at
Harry and Hermione for support, <div class="bookquote">``Okay, say Pettigrew could turn into a
rat -- there are millions of rats -- how's he (<font color='blue'><b>Pettigrew</b></font>) supposed to know which one
he (<font color='blue'><b>Pettigrew</b></font>)'s after if he (<font color='blue'><b>Pettigrew</b></font>) was locked up in Azkaban?''

 (<font color='red'><b>Hermione/HERMIONE</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``You know, Sirius, that's a fair question,''  (<font color='red'><b>Lupin/R. J. Lupin</b></font>)</div>said Lupin, turning to Black
and frowning slightly. <div class="bookquote">``How did you find out where he (<font color='blue'><b>Sirius</b></font>) was?''

 (<font color='red'><b>Black/Sirius/Sirius Black</b></font>)</div><p/>Black put one of his (<font color='blue'><b>Black</b></font>) clawlike hands inside his (<font color='blue'><b>Black</b></font>) robes and took out a
crumpled piece of paper, which he (<font color='blue'><b>Black</b></font>) smoothed flat and held out to show the
others.

<p/>It was the photograph of Ron and his (<font color='blue'><b>Ron</b></font>) family that had appeared in the
Daily Prophet the previous summer, and there, on Ron's shoulder, was
Scabbers.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``How did you get this?''  (<font color='red'><b>Lupin/R. J. Lupin</b></font>)</div>Lupin asked Black, thunderstruck.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Fudge,''  (<font color='red'><b>Black/Sirius/Sirius Black</b></font>)</div>said Black. ``When he (<font color='blue'><b>Sirius</b></font>) came to inspect Azkaban last year, he (<font color='blue'><b>Sirius</b></font>) gave
me his (<font color='blue'><b>Sirius</b></font>) paper. And there was Peter, on the front page on this boy's
shoulder... I knew him (<font color='blue'><b>Peter</b></font>) at once... how many times had I seen him (<font color='blue'><b>Peter</b></font>)
transform? And the caption said the boy would be going back to
Hogwarts... to where Harry was...

<p/><div class="bookquote">``My God,''  (<font color='red'><b>Lupin/R. J. Lupin</b></font>)</div>said Lupin softly, staring from Scabbers to the picture in the
paper and back again. <div class="bookquote">``His (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) front paw...''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``What about it?''  (<font color='red'><b>Ron</b></font>)</div>said Ron defiantly.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``He (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>)'s got a toe missing,''  (<font color='red'><b>Black/Sirius/Sirius Black</b></font>)</div>said Black.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Of course,''  (<font color='red'><b>Lupin</b></font>)</div>Lupin breathed. <div class="bookquote">``So simple... so brilliant... he (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) cut it off
himself?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Just before he (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) transformed,''  (<font color='red'><b>Black/Sirius/Sirius Black</b></font>)</div>said Black. <div class="bookquote">``When I cornered him (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>), he (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>)
yelled for the whole street to hear that I'd betrayed Lily and James.
Then, before I could curse him (<font color='blue'><b>James</b></font>), he (<font color='blue'><b>James</b></font>) blew apart the street with the wand
behind his (<font color='blue'><b>James</b></font>) back, killed everyone within twenty feet of himself -- and
sped down into the sewer with the other rats...''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Didn't you ever hear, Ron?''  (<font color='red'><b>Lupin/R. J. Lupin</b></font>)</div>said Lupin. <div class="bookquote">``The biggest bit of Peter they
found was his (<font color='blue'><b>Peter</b></font>) finger.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Look, Scabbers probably had a fight with another rat or something! He (<font color='blue'><b>Peter</b></font>)'s
been in my family for ages, right --''

 (<font color='red'><b>Lupin/R. J. Lupin</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Twelve years, in fact,''  (<font color='red'><b>Lupin/R. J. Lupin</b></font>)</div>said Lupin. <div class="bookquote">``Didn't you ever wonder why he (<font color='blue'><b>Peter</b></font>) was
living so long?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``We -- we've been taking good care of him (<font color='blue'><b>Peter</b></font>)!''  (<font color='red'><b>Ron</b></font>)</div>said Ron.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Not looking too good at the moment, though, is he (<font color='blue'><b>Peter</b></font>)?''  (<font color='red'><b>Lupin/R. J. Lupin</b></font>)</div>said Lupin. <div class="bookquote">``I'd
guess he (<font color='blue'><b>Peter</b></font>)'s been losing weight ever since he (<font color='blue'><b>Peter</b></font>) heard Sirius was on the
loose again...''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``He (<font color='blue'><b>Sirius</b></font>)'s been scared of that mad cat!''  (<font color='red'><b>Ron</b></font>)</div>said Ron, nodding toward
Crookshanks, who was still purring on the bed.

<p/>But that wasn't right, Harry thought suddenly... Scabbers had been
looking ill before he (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) met Crookshanks... ever since Ron's return from
Egypt... since the time when Black had escaped...

<p/><div class="bookquote">``This cat isn't mad,''  (<font color='red'><b>Black/Sirius/Sirius Black</b></font>)</div>said Black hoarsely. He (<font color='blue'><b>Black</b></font>) reached out a bony hand
and stroked Crookshanks's fluffy head. ``He (<font color='blue'><b>Sirius</b></font>)'s the most intelligent of his (<font color='blue'><b>Sirius</b></font>)
kind I've ever met. He (<font color='blue'><b>Sirius</b></font>) recognized Peter for what he (<font color='blue'><b>Sirius</b></font>) was right away. And
when he (<font color='blue'><b>Sirius</b></font>) met me, he (<font color='blue'><b>Sirius</b></font>) knew I was no dog. It was a while before he (<font color='blue'><b>Sirius</b></font>) trusted
me... Finally, I managed to communicate to him (<font color='blue'><b>Sirius</b></font>) what I was after, and
he (<font color='blue'><b>Sirius</b></font>)'s been helping me. .. <div class="bookquote">``What do you mean?''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>breathed Hermione.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``He (<font color='blue'><b>Sirius</b></font>) tried to bring Peter to me, but couldn't... so he (<font color='blue'><b>Peter</b></font>) stole the
passwords into Gryffindor Tower for me... As I understand it, he (<font color='blue'><b>Peter</b></font>) took
them from a boy's bedside table...''

 (<font color='red'><b>Harry/Potter/Harry Potter</b></font>)</div><p/>Harry's brain seemed to be sagging under the weight of what he (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) was
hearing. It was absurd... and yet...

<p/><div class="bookquote">``But Peter got wind of what was going on and ran for it.''  (<font color='red'><b>Black</b></font>)</div>croaked Black.
<div class="bookquote">``This cat -- Crookshanks, did you call him (<font color='blue'><b>Peter</b></font>)? -- told me Peter had left
blood on the sheets... I supposed he (<font color='blue'><b>Peter</b></font>) bit himself... Well, faking his (<font color='blue'><b>Peter</b></font>)
own death had worked once.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Harry/Potter/Harry Potter</b></font>)</div><p/>These words jolted Harry to his (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) senses.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``And why did he (<font color='blue'><b>Peter</b></font>) fake his (<font color='blue'><b>Peter</b></font>) death?''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) said furiously. <div class="bookquote">``Because he (<font color='blue'><b>Peter</b></font>) knew you
were about to kill him (<font color='blue'><b>Peter</b></font>) like you killed my parents!''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``No,''  (<font color='red'><b>Lupin/R. J. Lupin</b></font>)</div>said Lupin, <div class="bookquote">``Harry-''

 (<font color='red'><b>Lupin/R. J. Lupin</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``And now you've come to finish him (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) off!''

 (<font color='red'><b>Lupin/R. J. Lupin</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Yes, I have,''  (<font color='red'><b>Black/Sirius/Sirius Black</b></font>)</div>said Black, with an evil look at Scabbers.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Then I should've let Snape take you!''  (<font color='red'><b>Harry/Potter/Harry Potter</b></font>)</div>Harry shouted.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Harry,''  (<font color='red'><b>Lupin</b></font>)</div>said Lupin hurriedly, <div class="bookquote">``don't you see? All this time we've
thought Sirius betrayed your parents, and Peter tracked him (<font color='blue'><b>Peter</b></font>) down -- but
it was the other way around, don't you see? Peter betrayed your mother

 (<font color='red'><b>Lupin</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``THAT'S NOT TRUE!''  (<font color='red'><b>Harry/Potter/Harry Potter</b></font>)</div>Harry yelled. <div class="bookquote">``HE (<font color='blue'><b>Peter</b></font>) WAS THEIR SECRET-KEEPER! HE (<font color='blue'><b>Peter</b></font>) SAID SO
BEFORE YOU TURNED UP. HE (<font color='blue'><b>Peter</b></font>) SAID HE (<font color='blue'><b>Peter</b></font>) KILLED THEM!''

 (<font color='red'><b>He</b></font>)</div><p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) was pointing at Black, who shook his (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) head slowly; the sunken eyes
were suddenly over bright.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Harry... I as good as killed them,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) croaked. <div class="bookquote">``I persuaded Lily and
James to change to Peter at the last moment, persuaded them to use him (<font color='blue'><b>Peter</b></font>)
as Secret-Keeper instead of me... I'm to blame, I know it... The night

but when I arrived at his (<font color='blue'><b>Peter</b></font>) hiding place, he (<font color='blue'><b>Peter</b></font>)'d gone. Yet there was no sign
of a struggle. It didn't feel right. I was scared. I set out for your
parents' house straight away. And when I saw their house, destroyed, and
their bodies... I realized what Peter must've done... what I'd done...''

 (<font color='red'><b>He</b></font>)</div><p/>His (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) voice broke. He (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) turned away.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Enough of this,''  (<font color='red'><b>Lupin/R. J. Lupin</b></font>)</div>said Lupin, and there was a steely note in his (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) voice
Harry had never heard before. <div class="bookquote">``There's one certain way to prove what
really happened. Ron, give me that rat.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``What are you going to do with him (<font color='blue'><b>Ron</b></font>) if I give him (<font color='blue'><b>Ron</b></font>) to you?''  (<font color='red'><b>Ron</b></font>)</div>Ron asked
Lupin tensely.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Force him (<font color='blue'><b>Ron</b></font>) to show himself,''  (<font color='red'><b>Lupin/R. J. Lupin</b></font>)</div>said Lupin. <div class="bookquote">``If he (<font color='blue'><b>Ron</b></font>) really is a rat, it
won't hurt him (<font color='blue'><b>Ron</b></font>).''

 (<font color='red'><b>Ron</b></font>)</div><p/>Ron hesitated. Then at long last, he (<font color='blue'><b>Ron</b></font>) held out Scabbers and Lupin took
him (<font color='blue'><b>Ron</b></font>). Scabbers began to squeak without stopping, twisting and turning,
his (<font color='blue'><b>Ron</b></font>) tiny black eyes bulging in his (<font color='blue'><b>Ron</b></font>) head. <div class="bookquote">``Ready, Sirius?''  (<font color='red'><b>Lupin/R. J. Lupin</b></font>)</div>said Lupin.

<p/>Black had already retrieved Snape's wand from the bed. He (<font color='blue'><b>Black</b></font>) approached
Lupin and the struggling rat, and his (<font color='blue'><b>Black</b></font>) wet eyes suddenly seemed to be
burning in his (<font color='blue'><b>Black</b></font>) face.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Together?''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Black</b></font>) said quietly.

<p/>``I think so,,, said Lupin, holding Scabbers tightly in one hand and his (<font color='blue'><b>Ron</b></font>)
wand in the other. <div class="bookquote">``On the count of three. One -- two -- THREE!''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/>A flash of blue-white light erupted from both wands; for a moment,
Scabbers was frozen in midair, his (<font color='blue'><b>Black</b></font>) small gray form twisting madly -- Ron
yelled -- the rat fell and hit the floor. There was another blinding
flash of light and then --

<p/>It was like watching a speeded-up film of a growing tree. A head was
shooting upward from the ground; limbs were sprouting; a moment later, a
man was standing where Scabbers had been, cringing and wringing his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>)
hands. Crookshanks was spitting and snarling on the bed; the hair on his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>)
back was standing up.

<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) was a very short man, hardly taller than Harry and Hermione. His (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>)
thin, colorless hair was unkempt and there was a large bald patch on
top. He (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) had the shrunken appearance of a plump man who has lost a lot of
weight in a short time. His (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) skin looked grubby, almost like Scabbers's
fur, and something of the rat lingered around his (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) pointed nose and his (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>)
very small, watery eyes. He (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) looked around at them all, his (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) breathing
fast and shallow. Harry saw his (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) eyes dart to the door and back again.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Well, hello, Peter,''  (<font color='red'><b>Lupin/R. J. Lupin</b></font>)</div>said Lupin pleasantly, as though rats frequently
erupted into old school friends around him (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>). ``Long time, no see.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``S -- Sirius... R -- Remus...''  (<font color='red'><b>Pettigrew/Peter/Peter Pettigrew</b></font>)</div>Even Pettigrew's voice was squeaky.
Again, his (<font color='blue'><b>Pettigrew</b></font>) eyes darted toward the door. <div class="bookquote">``My friends... my old
friends...''

 (<font color='red'><b>Black/Sirius/Sirius Black</b></font>)</div><p/>Black's wand arm rose, but Lupin seized him (<font color='blue'><b>Black</b></font>) around the wrist, gave him (<font color='blue'><b>Black</b></font>) a
warning took, then turned again to Pettigrew, his (<font color='blue'><b>Pettigrew</b></font>) voice light and
casual.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``We've been having a little chat, Peter, about what happened the night

whole room.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Voldemort, teach me tricks?''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Pettigrew</b></font>) said.

<p/>Pettigrew flinched as though Black had brandished a whip at him (<font color='blue'><b>Pettigrew</b></font>).

<p/><div class="bookquote">``What, scared to hear your old master's name?''  (<font color='red'><b>Black/Sirius/Sirius Black</b></font>)</div>said Black. I don't blame

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Don't know what you mean, Sirius --''  (<font color='red'><b>Pettigrew/Peter/Peter Pettigrew</b></font>)</div>muttered Pettigrew, his (<font color='blue'><b>Pettigrew</b></font>) breathing

<p/><div class="bookquote">``You haven't been hiding from me for twelve years,''  (<font color='red'><b>Black/Sirius/Sirius Black</b></font>)</div>said Black. <div class="bookquote">``You've

<p/><div class="bookquote">``How dare you,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Black</b></font>) growled, sounding suddenly like the bearsized dog he (<font color='blue'><b>Black</b></font>)
had been. I, a spy for Voldemort? When did I ever sneak around people
who were stronger and more powerful than myself? But you, Peter -- I'll
never understand why I didn't see you were the spy from the start. You
always liked big friends who'd look after you, didn't you? It used to be
us... me and Remus... and James...

<p/>Pettigrew wiped his (<font color='blue'><b>Pettigrew</b></font>) face again; he (<font color='blue'><b>Pettigrew</b></font>) was almost panting for breath.

telling Voldemort you could hand him (<font color='blue'><b>Voldemort</b></font>) the Potters.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Pettigrew/Peter/Peter Pettigrew</b></font>)</div><p/>Pettigrew was muttering distractedly; Harry caught words like
<div class="bookquote">``far-fetched''  (<font color='red'><b>Harry/Potter/Harry Potter</b></font>)</div>and <div class="bookquote">``lunacy,''  (<font color='red'><b>Harry/Potter/Harry Potter</b></font>)</div>but he (<font color='blue'><b>Pettigrew</b></font>) couldn't help paying more attention
to the ashen color of Pettigrew's face and the way his (<font color='blue'><b>Pettigrew</b></font>) eyes continued to
dart toward the windows and door.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Professor Lupin?''  (<font color='red'><b>Hermione/HERMIONE</b></font>)</div>said Hermione timidly. <div class="bookquote">``Can -- can I say something?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Certainly, Hermione,''  (<font color='red'><b>Lupin/R. J. Lupin</b></font>)</div>said Lupin courteously.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Well -- Scabbers -- I mean, this -- this man -- he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>)'s been sleeping in

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``There!''  (<font color='red'><b>Pettigrew/Peter/Peter Pettigrew</b></font>)</div>said Pettigrew shrilly, pointing at Ron with his (<font color='blue'><b>Pettigrew</b></font>) maimed hand.

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I'll tell you why,''  (<font color='red'><b>Black/Sirius/Sirius Black</b></font>)</div>said Black. <div class="bookquote">``Because you never did anything for

wizard who'd lost all of his (<font color='blue'><b>wizard</b></font>) power, were you? You'd want to be quite
sure he (<font color='blue'><b>wizard</b></font>) was the biggest bully in the playground before you went back to
him (<font color='blue'><b>wizard</b></font>), wouldn't you? Why else did you find a wizard family to take you in?
Keeping an ear out for news, weren't YOU, Peter? Just in case your old

 (<font color='red'><b>Pettigrew/Peter/Peter Pettigrew</b></font>)</div><p/>Pettigrew opened his (<font color='blue'><b>Pettigrew</b></font>) mouth and closed it several times. He (<font color='blue'><b>Pettigrew</b></font>) seemed to
have lost the ability to talk.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Er -- Mr. Black -- Sirius?''  (<font color='red'><b>Hermione/HERMIONE</b></font>)</div>said Hermione.

<p/>Black jumped at being addressed like this and stared at Hermione as
though he (<font color='blue'><b>Pettigrew</b></font>) had never seen anything quite like her (<font color='blue'><b>Hermione</b></font>).

<p/><div class="bookquote">``If you don't mind me asking, how -- how did you get out of Azkaban, if

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Thank you!''  (<font color='red'><b>Pettigrew/Peter/Peter Pettigrew</b></font>)</div>gasped Pettigrew, nodding frantically at her (<font color='blue'><b>Hermione</b></font>). <div class="bookquote">``Exactly!
Precisely what I --''

 (<font color='red'><b>Lupin/R. J. Lupin</b></font>)</div><p/>But Lupin silenced him (<font color='blue'><b>Pettigrew</b></font>) with a look. Black was frowning slightly at
Hermione, but not as though he (<font color='blue'><b>Black</b></font>) were annoyed with her (<font color='blue'><b>Hermione</b></font>). He (<font color='blue'><b>Black</b></font>) seemed to be
pondering his (<font color='blue'><b>Black</b></font>) answer.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``I don't know how I did it,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Black</b></font>) said slowly. <div class="bookquote">``I think the only reason I
never lost my mind is that I knew I was innocent. That wasn't a happy
thought, so the dementors couldn't suck it out of me... but it kept me
sane and knowing who I am... helped me keep my powers... so when it all
became ... too much... I could transform in my cell... become a dog.
Dementors can't see, you know...''  (<font color='red'><b>He</b></font>)</div>He (<font color='blue'><b>Black</b></font>) swallowed. <div class="bookquote">``They feel their way
toward people by feeding off their emotions... They could tell that my
feelings were less -- less human, less complex when I was a dog... but
they thought, of course, that I was losing my mind like everyone else in

no hope of driving them away from me without a wand...''

 (<font color='red'><b>Pettigrew/Peter/Peter Pettigrew</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``But then I saw Peter in that picture... I realized he (<font color='blue'><b>Peter</b></font>) was at Hogwarts

that the Dark Side was gathering strength again...''

 (<font color='red'><b>Pettigrew/Peter/Peter Pettigrew</b></font>)</div><p/>Pettigrew was shaking his (<font color='blue'><b>Pettigrew</b></font>) head, mouthing noiselessly, but staring all
the while at Black as though hypnotized.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``So you see, I had to do something. I was the only one who knew Peter
was still alive...''

 (<font color='red'><b>Harry</b></font>)</div><p/>Harry remembered what Mr. Weasley had told Mrs. Wealsey. ``The guards say

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``It was as if someone had lit a fire In my head, and the dementors

It's so much harder for them to sense animal emotions that they were
confused... I was thin, very thin... thin enough to slip through the
bars... I swam as a dog back to the mainland... I journeyed north and
slipped into the Hogwarts grounds as a dog. I've been living in the
forest ever since, except when I came to watch the Quidditch, of course.
You fly as well as your father did, Harry...''

 (<font color='red'><b>He</b></font>)</div><p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Weasley</b></font>) looked at Harry, who did not look away.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Believe me,''  (<font color='red'><b>Black</b></font>)</div>croaked Black. <div class="bookquote">``Believe me, Harry. I never betrayed James

 (<font color='red'><b>Harry/Potter/Harry Potter</b></font>)</div><p/>And at long last, Harry believed him (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>). Throat too tight to speak, he (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>)
nodded.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``No!''

 (<font color='red'><b>Pettigrew/Peter/Peter Pettigrew</b></font>)</div><p/>Pettigrew had fallen to his (<font color='blue'><b>Pettigrew</b></font>) knees as though Harry's nod had been his (<font color='blue'><b>Pettigrew</b></font>) own
death sentence. He (<font color='blue'><b>Pettigrew</b></font>) shuffled forward on his (<font color='blue'><b>Pettigrew</b></font>) knees, groveling, his (<font color='blue'><b>Pettigrew</b></font>) hands
clasped in front of him (<font color='blue'><b>Pettigrew</b></font>) as though praying.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Sirius -- it's me... it's Peter... your friend... you wouldn't --''

 (<font color='red'><b>Black/Sirius/Sirius Black</b></font>)</div><p/>Black kicked out and Pettigrew recoiled.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``There's enough filth on my robes without you touching them,''  (<font color='red'><b>Black/Sirius/Sirius Black</b></font>)</div>said
Black.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Remus!''  (<font color='red'><b>Pettigrew/Peter/Peter Pettigrew</b></font>)</div>Pettigrew squeaked, turning to Lupin instead, writhing
imploringly in front of him (<font color='blue'><b>Pettigrew</b></font>). <div class="bookquote">``You don't believe this wouldn't Sirius
have told you they'd changed the plan?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Not if he (<font color='blue'><b>Remus</b></font>) thought I was the spy, Peter,''  (<font color='red'><b>Lupin/R. J. Lupin</b></font>)</div>said Lupin. <div class="bookquote">``I assume that's
why you didn't tell me, Sirius?''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Pettigrew</b></font>) said casually over Pettigrews head.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Forgive me, Remus,''  (<font color='red'><b>Black/Sirius/Sirius Black</b></font>)</div>said Black.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Not at all, Padfoot, old friend,''  (<font color='red'><b>Lupin/R. J. Lupin</b></font>)</div>said Lupin, who was now rolling up
his (<font color='blue'><b>Black</b></font>) sleeves. <div class="bookquote">``And will you, in turn, forgive me for believing you were
the spy?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Of course,''  (<font color='red'><b>Black/Sirius/Sirius Black</b></font>)</div>said Black, and the ghost of a grin flitted across his (<font color='blue'><b>Black</b></font>)
gaunt face. He (<font color='blue'><b>Black</b></font>), too, began rolling up his (<font color='blue'><b>Black</b></font>) sleeves. <div class="bookquote">``Shall we kill him (<font color='blue'><b>spy</b></font>)
together?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Yes, I think so,''  (<font color='red'><b>Lupin/R. J. Lupin</b></font>)</div>said Lupin grimly.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``You wouldn't... you won't...,''  (<font color='red'><b>Pettigrew/Peter/Peter Pettigrew</b></font>)</div>gasped Pettigrew. And he (<font color='blue'><b>Pettigrew</b></font>) scrambled
around to Ron.

<p/>``Ron... haven't I been a good friend... a good pet? You won't let them
kill me, Ron, will you... you're on my side, aren't you.

<p/>But Ron was staring at Pettigrew with the utmost revulsion.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``I let you sleep in my bed!''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Pettigrew</b></font>) said.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Kind boy... kind master...''  (<font color='red'><b>Pettigrew/Peter/Peter Pettigrew</b></font>)</div>Pettigrew crawled toward Ron <div class="bookquote">``You won't let

 (<font color='red'><b>Ron</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``If you made a better rat than a human, it's not much to boast about,
Peter,''  (<font color='red'><b>Ron</b></font>)</div>said Black harshly. Ron, going still paler with pain, wrenched
his (<font color='blue'><b>Ron</b></font>) broken leg out of Pettigrew's reach. Pettigrew turned on his (<font color='blue'><b>Pettigrew</b></font>) knees,
staggered forward, and seized the hem of Hermione's robes.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Sweet girl... clever girl... you -- you won't let them... Help me...''

 (<font color='red'><b>Hermione/HERMIONE</b></font>)</div><p/>Hermione pulled her (<font color='blue'><b>Hermione</b></font>) robes out of Pettigrew's clutching hands and backed
away against the wall, looking horrified.

<p/>Pettigrew knelt, trembling uncontrollably, and-turned his (<font color='blue'><b>Pettigrew</b></font>) head slowly
toward Harry.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Harry... Harry... you look just like your father... just like him (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>)...''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``HOW DARE YOU SPEAK TO HARRY?''  (<font color='red'><b>Black/Sirius/Sirius Black</b></font>)</div>roared Black. <div class="bookquote">``HOW DARE YOU FACE HIM? HOW

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Harry,''  (<font color='red'><b>Pettigrew/Peter/Peter Pettigrew</b></font>)</div>whispered Pettigrew, shuffling toward him (<font color='blue'><b>Pettigrew</b></font>), hands outstretched.
<div class="bookquote">``Harry, James wouldn't have wanted me killed... James would have
understood, Harry... he (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) would have shown me mercy...''

 (<font color='red'><b>Lupin/R. J. Lupin</b></font>)</div><p/>Both Black and Lupin strode forward, seized Pettigrew's shoulders, and
threw him (<font color='blue'><b>Pettigrew</b></font>) backward onto the floor. He (<font color='blue'><b>Pettigrew</b></font>) sat there, twitching with terror,
staring up at them.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``You sold Lily and James to Voldemort,''  (<font color='red'><b>Black/Sirius/Sirius Black</b></font>)</div>said Black, who was shaking too.
<div class="bookquote">``Do you deny it?''

 (<font color='red'><b>Pettigrew/Peter/Peter Pettigrew</b></font>)</div><p/>Pettigrew burst into tears. It was horrible to watch, like an oversized,

<p/><div class="bookquote">``NO!''  (<font color='red'><b>Harry/Potter/Harry Potter</b></font>)</div>Harry yelled. He (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) ran forward, placing himself in front Pettigrew,
facing the wands. <div class="bookquote">``You can't kill him (<font color='blue'><b>Peter</b></font>),''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Pettigrew</b></font>) said breathlessly. <div class="bookquote">``You

 (<font color='red'><b>Lupin</b></font>)</div><p/>Black and Lupin both looked staggered.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Harry, this piece of vermin is the reason you have no parents,''  (<font color='red'><b>Black</b></font>)</div>Black

 (<font color='red'><b>Harry/Potter/Harry Potter</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``He (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) can go to Azkaban,''  (<font color='red'><b>Harry/Potter/Harry Potter</b></font>)</div>Harry repeated. <div class="bookquote">``If anyone deserves that place,
he (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) does...''

 (<font color='red'><b>Pettigrew/Peter/Peter Pettigrew</b></font>)</div><p/>Pettigrew was still wheezing behind him (<font color='blue'><b>Pettigrew</b></font>).

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Very well,''  (<font color='red'><b>Lupin/R. J. Lupin</b></font>)</div>said Lupin. <div class="bookquote">``Stand aside, Harry.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Harry/Potter/Harry Potter</b></font>)</div><p/>Harry hesitated.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``I'm going to tie him (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) up,''  (<font color='red'><b>Lupin/R. J. Lupin</b></font>)</div>said Lupin. <div class="bookquote">``That's all, I swear.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Harry/Potter/Harry Potter</b></font>)</div><p/>Harry stepped out of the way. Thin cords shot from Lupin's wand this
time, and next moment, Pettigrew was wriggling on the floor, bound and
gagged.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``But if you transform, Peter,''  (<font color='red'><b>Black/Sirius/Sirius Black</b></font>)</div>growled Black, his (<font color='blue'><b>Black</b></font>) own wand pointing at
Pettigrew too, <div class="bookquote">``we will kill you. You agree, Harry?''

 (<font color='red'><b>Pettigrew</b></font>)</div><p/>Harry looked down at the pitiful figure on the floor and nodded so that
Pettigrew could see him (<font color='blue'><b>Pettigrew</b></font>).

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Right,''  (<font color='red'><b>Lupin/R. J. Lupin</b></font>)</div>said Lupin, suddenly businesslike. <div class="bookquote">``Ron, I can't mend bones
nearly as well as Madam Pomfrey, so I think it's best if we just strap
your leg up until we can get you to the hospital wing.''

 (<font color='red'><b>He</b></font>)</div><p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Pettigrew</b></font>) hurried over to Ron, bent down, tapped Ron's leg with his (<font color='blue'><b>Ron</b></font>) wand, and
muttered, <div class="bookquote">``Ferula.''  (<font color='red'><b>Ron</b></font>)</div>Bandages spun up Ron's leg, strapping it tightly to
a splint. Lupin helped him (<font color='blue'><b>Ron</b></font>) to his (<font color='blue'><b>Ron</b></font>) feet; Ron put his (<font color='blue'><b>Ron</b></font>) weight gingerly on
the leg and didn't wince.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``That's better,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Ron</b></font>) said. <div class="bookquote">``Thanks.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``What about Professor Snape?''  (<font color='red'><b>Hermione/HERMIONE</b></font>)</div>said Hermione in a small voice, looking
down at Snape's prone figure.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``There's nothing seriously wrong with him (<font color='blue'><b>Snape</b></font>),''  (<font color='red'><b>Lupin/R. J. Lupin</b></font>)</div>said Lupin, bending over
Snape and checking his (<font color='blue'><b>Snape</b></font>) pulse. <div class="bookquote">``You were just a little --
overenthusiastic. Still out cold. Er -- perhaps it will be best if we
don't revive him (<font color='blue'><b>Snape</b></font>) until we're safety back in the castle. We can take him (<font color='blue'><b>Snape</b></font>)
like this...''

 (<font color='red'><b>He</b></font>)</div><p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Snape</b></font>) muttered, <div class="bookquote">``Mobilicorpus.''  (<font color='red'><b>He</b></font>)</div>As though invisible strings were tied to
Snape's wrists, neck, and knees, he (<font color='blue'><b>Snape</b></font>) was pulled into a standing position,
head still lolling unpleasantly, like a grotesque puppet. He (<font color='blue'><b>Snape</b></font>) hung a few
inches above the ground, his (<font color='blue'><b>Snape</b></font>) limp feet dangling. Lupin picked up the
Invisibility Cloak and tucked it safely into his (<font color='blue'><b>Snape</b></font>) pocket.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``And two of us should be chained to this,''  (<font color='red'><b>Black/Sirius/Sirius Black</b></font>)</div>said Black, nudging Pettigrew
with his (<font color='blue'><b>Black</b></font>) toe. <div class="bookquote">``Just to make sure.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I'll do it,''  (<font color='red'><b>Lupin/R. J. Lupin</b></font>)</div>said Lupin.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``And me,''  (<font color='red'><b>Ron</b></font>)</div>said Ron savagely, limping forward.

<p/>Black conjured heavy manacles from thin air; soon Pettigrew was upright
again, left arm chained to Lupin's right, right arm to Ron's left. Ron's
face was set. He (<font color='blue'><b>Ron</b></font>) seemed to have taken Scabbers's true identity as a
personal insult. Crookshanks leapt lightly off the bed and led the way
out of the room, his (<font color='blue'><b>Ron</b></font>) bottlebrush tail held jauntily high.

<p/>CHAPTER TWENTY

<p/>THE DEMENTOR``S KISS

<p/>Harry had never been part of a stranger group. Crookshanks led the way
down the stairs; Lupin, Pettigrew, and Ron went next, looking like
entrants in a six-legged race. Next came Professor Snape, drifting
creepily along, his (<font color='blue'><b>Snape</b></font>) toes hitting each stair as they descended, held up
by his (<font color='blue'><b>Snape</b></font>) own wand, which was being pointed at him (<font color='blue'><b>Snape</b></font>) by Sirius. Harry and
Hermione brought up the rear.

<p/>Getting back into the tunnel was difficult. Lupin, Pettigrew, and Ron
had to turn sideways to manage it; Lupin still had Pettigrew covered
with his (<font color='blue'><b>Pettigrew</b></font>) wand. Harry could see them edging awkwardly along the tunnel in
single file. Crookshanks was still in the lead. Harry went right after
Black, who was still making Snape drift along ahead of them; he (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) kept
bumping his (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) lolling head on the low ceiling. Harry had the impression
Black was making no effort to prevent this.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``You know what this means?''  (<font color='red'><b>Black/Sirius/Sirius Black</b></font>)</div>Black said abruptly to Harry as they made
their slow progress along the tunnel. <div class="bookquote">``Turning Pettigrew in?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``You' re free,''  (<font color='red'><b>Harry/Potter/Harry Potter</b></font>)</div>said Harry.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Yes...,''  (<font color='red'><b>Black/Sirius/Sirius Black</b></font>)</div>said Black. <div class="bookquote">``But I'm also -- I don't know if anyone ever told
you -- I'm your godfather.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Yeah, I knew that,''  (<font color='red'><b>Harry/Potter/Harry Potter</b></font>)</div>said Harry.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Well... your parents appointed me your guardian,''  (<font color='red'><b>Black/Sirius/Sirius Black</b></font>)</div>said Black stiffly.
<div class="bookquote">``If anything happened to them...''

 (<font color='red'><b>Harry/Potter/Harry Potter</b></font>)</div><p/>Harry waited. Did Black mean what he (<font color='blue'><b>Black</b></font>) thought he (<font color='blue'><b>Black</b></font>) meant?

<p/><div class="bookquote">``I'll understand, of course, if you want to stay with your aunt and
uncle,''  (<font color='red'><b>Black/Sirius/Sirius Black</b></font>)</div>said Black. <div class="bookquote">``But... well... think about it. Once my name's
cleared... if you wanted a... a different home...''

 (<font color='red'><b>Harry/Potter/Harry Potter</b></font>)</div><p/>Some sort of explosion took place in the pit of Harry's stomach.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``What -- live with you?''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) said, accidentally cracking his (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) head on a
bit of rock protruding from the ceiling. <div class="bookquote">``Leave the Dursleys?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Of course, I thought you wouldn't want to,''  (<font color='red'><b>Black/Sirius/Sirius Black</b></font>)</div>said Black quickly. <div class="bookquote">``I
understand, I just thought I'd --''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Are you insane?''  (<font color='red'><b>Harry/Potter/Harry Potter</b></font>)</div>said Harry, his (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) voice easily as croaky as Black's.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Of course I want to leave the Dursleys! Have you got a house? When can
I move in?''

 (<font color='red'><b>him</b></font>)</div><p/>Black turned right around to look at him (<font color='blue'><b>Black</b></font>); Snape's head was scraping the
ceiling but Black didn't seem to care.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``You want to?''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Black</b></font>) said. <div class="bookquote">``You mean it?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Yeah, I mean it!''  (<font color='red'><b>Harry/Potter/Harry Potter</b></font>)</div>said Harry.

<p/>Black's gaunt face broke into the first true smile Harry had seen upon
it. The difference it made was startling, as though a person ten years
younger were shining through the starved mask; for a moment, he (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) was
recognizable as the man who had laughed at Harry's parents' wedding.

<p/>They did not speak again until they had reached the end of the tunnel.
Crookshanks darted up first; he (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) had evidently pressed his (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) paw to the
knot on the trunk, because Lupin, Pettigrew, and Ron clambered upward
without any sound of savaging branches.

<p/>Black saw Snape up through the hole, then stood back for Harry and
Hermione to pass. At last, all of them were out.

<p/>The grounds were very dark now; the only light came from the distant
windows of the castle. Without a word, they set off. Pettigrew was still
wheezing and occasionally whimpering. Harry's mind was buzzing. He (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) was
going to leave the Dursleys. He (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) was going to live with Sirius Black, his (<font color='blue'><b>Black</b></font>)
parents' best friend... He (<font color='blue'><b>Black</b></font>) felt dazed... What would happen when he (<font color='blue'><b>Black</b></font>)
told the Dursleys he (<font color='blue'><b>Black</b></font>) was going to live with the convict they'd seen on
television... !

<p/><div class="bookquote">``One wrong move, Peter,''  (<font color='red'><b>Lupin/R. J. Lupin</b></font>)</div>said Lupin threateningly ahead. His (<font color='blue'><b>Black</b></font>) wand was
still pointed sideways at Pettigrew's chest.

<p/>Silently they tramped through the grounds, the castle lights growing
slowly larger. Snape was still drifting weirdly ahead of Black, his (<font color='blue'><b>Black</b></font>) chin
bumping on his (<font color='blue'><b>Black</b></font>) chest. And then -

<p/>A cloud shifted. There were suddenly dim shadows on the ground. Their
party was bathed in moonlight.

<p/>Snape collided with Lupin, Pettigrew, and Ron, who had stopped abruptly.
Black froze. He (<font color='blue'><b>Snape</b></font>) flung out one arm to make Harry and Hermione stop.

<p/>Harry could see Lupin's silhouette. He (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) had gone rigid. Then his (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) limbs
began to shake.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Oh, my --''  (<font color='red'><b>Hermione/HERMIONE</b></font>)</div>Hermione gasped. <div class="bookquote">``He (<font color='blue'><b>Peter</b></font>) didn't take his (<font color='blue'><b>Peter</b></font>) potion tonight! He (<font color='blue'><b>Peter</b></font>)'s
not safe!''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Run,''  (<font color='red'><b>Black</b></font>)</div>Black whispered. <div class="bookquote">``Run. Now.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Harry</b></font>)</div><p/>But Harry couldn't run. Ron was chained to Pettigrew and Lupin. He (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) leapt
forward but Black caught him (<font color='blue'><b>Black</b></font>) around the chest and threw him (<font color='blue'><b>Black</b></font>) back.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Leave it to me -- RUN!''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/>There was a terrible snarling noise. Lupin's head was lengthening. So
was his (<font color='blue'><b>Black</b></font>) body. His (<font color='blue'><b>Black</b></font>) shoulders were hunching. Hair was sprouting visibly on
his (<font color='blue'><b>Black</b></font>) face and hands, which were curling into clawed paws. Crookshanks's
hair was on end again; he (<font color='blue'><b>Black</b></font>) was backing away --

<p/>As the werewolf reared, snapping its long jaws, Sirius disappeared from
Harry's side. He (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) had transformed. The enormous, bearlike dog bounded
forward. As the werewolf wrenched itself free of the manacle binding it,
the dog seized it about the neck and pulled it backward, away from Ron
and Pettigrew. They were locked, jaw to jaw, claws ripping at each other.

<p/>Harry stood, transfixed by the sight, too intent upon the battle to
notice anything else. It was Hermione's scream that alerted him (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) --

<p/>Pettigrew had dived for Lupin's dropped wand. Ron, unsteady on his (<font color='blue'><b>Ron</b></font>)
bandaged leg, fell. There was a bang, a burst of light -- and Ron lay
motionless on the ground. Another bang -- Crookshanks flew into the air
and back to the earth in a heap.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Expelliarmus.''  (<font color='red'><b>Harry/Potter/Harry Potter</b></font>)</div>Harry yelled, pointing his (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) own wand at Pettigrew;
Lupin's wand flew high into the air and out of sight. <div class="bookquote">``Stay where you
are!''  (<font color='red'><b>Harry/Potter/Harry Potter</b></font>)</div>Harry shouted, running forward.

<p/>Too late. Pettigrew had transformed. Harry saw his (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) bald tail whip
through the manacle on Ron's outstretched arm and heard a scurrying
through the grass.

<p/>There was a howl and a rumbling growl; Harry turned to see the werewolf
taking flight; it was galloping into the forest --

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Sirius, he (<font color='blue'><b>Peter</b></font>)'s gone, Pettigrew transformed!''  (<font color='red'><b>the werewolf</b></font>)</div>Harry yelled.

<p/>Black was bleeding; there were gashes across his (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) muzzle and back, but at
Harry's words he (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) scrambled up again, and in an instant, the sound of his (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>)
paws faded to silence as he (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) pounded away across the grounds.

<p/>Harry and Hermione dashed over to Ron.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``What did he (<font color='blue'><b>Pettigrew</b></font>) do to him (<font color='blue'><b>Pettigrew</b></font>)?''  (<font color='red'><b>Hermione/HERMIONE</b></font>)</div>Hermione whispered. Ron's eyes were only
half-closed, his (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) mouth hung open; he (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) was definitely alive, they could
hear him (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) breathing, but he (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) didn't seem to recognize them.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``I don't know...''

 (<font color='red'><b>Harry</b></font>)</div><p/>Harry looked desperately around. Black and Lupin both gone... they had
no one but Snape for company, still hanging, unconscious, in midair.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``We'd better get them up to the castle and tell someone,''  (<font color='red'><b>Harry/Potter/Harry Potter</b></font>)</div>said Harry,
pushing his (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) hair out of his (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) eyes, trying to think straight. <div class="bookquote">``Come --''

 (<font color='red'><b>a dog</b></font>)</div><p/>But then, from beyond the range of their vision, they heard a yelping, a
whining: a dog in pain...

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Sirius,''  (<font color='red'><b>a dog</b></font>)</div>Harry muttered, staring into the darkness.

<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) had a moment's indecision, but there was nothing they could do for
Ron at the moment, and by the sound of it, Black was in trouble --

<p/>Harry set off at a run, Hermione right behind him (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>). The yelping seemed to
be coming from the ground near the edge of the lake. They pelted toward
it, and Harry, running flat out, felt the cold without realizing what it
must mean -

<p/>The yelping stopped abruptly. As they reached the lakeshore, they saw
why -- Sirius had turned back into a man. He (<font color='blue'><b>Sirius</b></font>) was crouched on all fours,
his (<font color='blue'><b>Sirius</b></font>) hands over his (<font color='blue'><b>Sirius</b></font>) head.

<p/>`Nooo,'' he (<font color='blue'><b>Sirius</b></font>) moaned. <div class="bookquote">``Nooo... please...''

 (<font color='red'><b>Harry/Potter/Harry Potter</b></font>)</div><p/>And then Harry saw them. Dementors, at least a hundred of them, gliding
in a black mass around the lake toward them. He (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) spun around, the
familiar, icy cold penetrating his (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) insides, fog starting to obscure his (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>)
vision; more were appearing out of the darkness on every side; they were
encircling them...

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Herrnione, think of something happy!''  (<font color='red'><b>He</b></font>)</div>Harry yelled, raising his (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) wand,
blinking furiously to try and clear his (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) vision, shaking his (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) head to rid
it of the faint screaming that had started inside it --

<p/>I'm going to live with my godfather. I'm leaving the Dursleys.

<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>godfather</b></font>) forced himself to think of Black, and only Black, and began to chant:
<div class="bookquote">``Expecto patronum! Expecto patronum!''

 (<font color='red'><b>Black/Sirius/Sirius Black</b></font>)</div><p/>Black gave a shudder, rolled over, and lay motionless on the ground,
pale as death.

<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Black</b></font>)'ll be all right. I'm going to go and live with him (<font color='blue'><b>Black</b></font>).

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Expecto patronum! Hermione, help me! Expecto patronum!''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Expecto --''  (<font color='red'><b>Hermione/HERMIONE</b></font>)</div>Hermione whispered, <div class="bookquote">``expecto -- expecto --''

 (<font color='red'><b>Hermione/HERMIONE</b></font>)</div><p/>But she (<font color='blue'><b>Hermione</b></font>) couldn't do it. The dementors were closing in, barely ten feet
from them. They formed a solid wall around Harry and Hermione, and were
getting closer...

<p/><div class="bookquote">``EXPECTO PATRONUM!''  (<font color='red'><b>Hermione/HERMIONE</b></font>)</div>Harry yelled, trying to blot the screaming from his (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>)
ears. <div class="bookquote">``EXPECTO PATRONUM!''

 (<font color='red'><b>him</b></font>)</div><p/>A thin wisp of silver escaped his (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) wand and hovered like mist before him (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>).
At the same moment, Harry felt Hermione collapse next to him (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>). He (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) was
alone... completely alone...

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Expecto -- expecto patronum --''

 (<font color='red'><b>He</b></font>)</div><p/>Harry felt his (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) knees hit the cold grass. Fog was clouding his (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) eyes. With
a huge effort, he (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) fought to remember -- Sirius was innocent -- innocent
-- We'll be okay -- I' mgoing to live with him (<font color='blue'><b>Sirius</b></font>) --

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Ex ecto patronum!''  (<font color='red'><b>him</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Sirius</b></font>) gasped.

<p/>By the feeble light of his (<font color='blue'><b>Sirius</b></font>) formless Patronus, He (<font color='blue'><b>Sirius</b></font>) saw a dementor halt,
very close to him (<font color='blue'><b>Sirius</b></font>). It couldn't walk through the cloud of silver mist
Harry had conjured. A dead, slimy hand slid out from under the cloak. It
made a gesture as though to sweep the Patronus aside.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``No -- no --''  (<font color='red'><b>Harry/Potter/Harry Potter</b></font>)</div>Harry gasped. <div class="bookquote">``He (<font color='blue'><b>Hermione</b></font>)'s innocent... expecto expecto patronum
--''

 (<font color='red'><b>He</b></font>)</div><p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) could feet them watching him (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>), hear their rattling breath like an evil
wind around him (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>). The nearest dementor seemed to be considering him (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>). Then
it raised both its rotting hands -- and lowered its hood.

<p/>Where there should have been eyes, there was only thin, gray scabbed
skin, stretched blankly over empty sockets. But there was a mouth... a
gaping, shapeless hole, sucking the air with the sound of a death
rattle.

<p/>A paralyzing terror filled Harry so that he (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) couldn't move or speak. His (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>)
Patronus flickered and died.

<p/>White fog was blinding him (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>). He (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) had to fight... expecto patronum ... he (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>)
couldn't see... and in the distance, he (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) heard the familiar screaming...
expecto patronum... he (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) groped in the mist for Sirius, and found his (<font color='blue'><b>Sirius</b></font>)
arm... they weren't going to take him (<font color='blue'><b>Sirius</b></font>)...

<p/>But a pair of strong, clammy hands suddenly attached themselves around
Harry's neck. They were forcing his (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) face upward... He (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) could feel its
breath... It was going to get rid of him (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) first... He (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) could feel its
putrid breath... His (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) mother was screaming in his (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) ears... She (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) was going
to be the last thing he (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) ever heard --

<p/>And then, through the fog that was drowning him (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>), he (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) thought he (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) saw a
silvery light growing brighter and brighter... He (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) felt himself fall
forward onto the grass... Facedown, too weak to move, sick and shaking,
Harry opened his (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) eyes. The dementor must have released him (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>). The blinding
light was illuminating the grass around him (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>)... The screaming had
stopped, the cold was ebbing away...

<p/>Something was driving the dementors back... It was circling around him (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>)
and Black and Hermione... They were leaving...

<p/>The air was warm again...

<p/>With every ounce of strength he (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) could muster, Harry raised his (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) head a
few inches and saw an animal amid the light, galloping away across the
lake... Eyes blurred with sweat, Harry tried to make out what it
was... It was as bright as a unicorn... Fighting to stay conscious,
Harry watched it canter to a halt as it reached the opposite shore. For
a moment, Harry saw, by its brightness, somebody welcoming it back...
raising his (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) hand to pat it... someone who looked strangely familiar ...
but it couldn't be...

<p/>Harry didn't understand. He (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) couldn't think anymore. He (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) felt the last of
his (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) strength leave him (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>), and his (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) head hit the ground as he (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) fainted.

 (<font color='red'><b>Harry/Potter/Harry Potter</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Well, well... we shall see, Snape, we shall see... The boy has
undoubtedly been foolish...''

 (<font color='red'><b>Harry/Potter/Harry Potter</b></font>)</div><p/>Harry lay listening with his (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) eyes tight shut. He (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) felt very groggy. The
words he (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) was hearing seemed to be traveling very slowly from his (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) ears to
his (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) brain, so that it was difficult to understand... His (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) limbs felt
like lead; his (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) eyelids too heavy to lift... He (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) wanted to lie here, on
this comfortable bed, forever...

<p/><div class="bookquote">``What amazes me most is the behavior of the dementors... you've really
no idea what made them retreat, Snape?''

 (<font color='red'><b>He</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``No, Minister... by the time I had come `round they were heading back to
their positions at the entrances...''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Extraordinary. And yet Black, and Harry, and the girl --''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``All unconscious by the time I reached them. I bound and gagged Black,
naturally, conjured stretchers, and brought them all straight back to
the castle.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/>There was a pause. Harry's brain seemed to be moving a little faster,
and as it did, a gnawing sensation grew in the pit of his (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) stomach...

<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) opened his (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) eyes.

<p/>Everything was slightly blurred. Somebody had removed his (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) glasses. He (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>)
was lying in the dark hospital wing. At the very end of the ward, he (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>)
could make out Madam Pomfrey with her (<font color='blue'><b>Pomfrey</b></font>) back to him (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>), bending over a bed.
Harry squinted. Ron's red hair was visible beneath Madam Pomfrey's arm.

<p/>Harry moved his (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) head over on the pillow. In the bed to his (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) right lay
Hermione. Moonlight was falling across her (<font color='blue'><b>Hermione</b></font>) bed. Her (<font color='blue'><b>Hermione</b></font>) eyes were open too.
She (<font color='blue'><b>Hermione</b></font>) looked petrified, and when she (<font color='blue'><b>Hermione</b></font>) saw that Harry was awake, pressed a
finger to her (<font color='blue'><b>Hermione</b></font>) lips, then pointed to the hospital wing door. It was ajar,
and the voices of Cornelius Fudge and Snape were coming through it from
the corridor outside.

<p/>Madam Pomfrey now came walking briskly up the dark ward to Harry's bed.
He (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) turned to took at her (<font color='blue'><b>Pomfrey</b></font>). She (<font color='blue'><b>Pomfrey</b></font>) was carrying the largest block of
chocolate he (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) had ever seen in his (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) life. It looked like a small boulder.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Ah, you're awake!''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Pomfrey</b></font>) said briskly. She (<font color='blue'><b>Pomfrey</b></font>) placed the chocolate on
Harry's bedside table and began breaking it apart with a small hammer.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``How's Ron?''  (<font color='red'><b>Harry/Potter/Harry Potter</b></font>)</div>said Harry and Hermione together.

<p/>``He (<font color='blue'><b>Ron</b></font>)'ll live, said Madam Pomfrey grimly. <div class="bookquote">``As for you two you'll be
staying here until I'm satisfied you're -- Potter, what do you think
you're doing?''

 (<font color='red'><b>Harry/Potter/Harry Potter</b></font>)</div><p/>Harry was sitting up, putting his (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) glasses back on, and picking up his (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>)
wand.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``I need to see the headmaster,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) said.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Potter,''  (<font color='red'><b>Madam Pomfrey</b></font>)</div>said Madam Pomfrey soothingly, <div class="bookquote">``it's all right. They've got
Black. He (<font color='blue'><b>Black</b></font>)'s locked away upstairs. The dementors will be performing the
kiss any moment now --''

 (<font color='red'><b>Madam Pomfrey</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``WHAT?''

 (<font color='red'><b>Harry/Potter/Harry Potter</b></font>)</div><p/>Harry jumped up out of bed; Hermione had done the same. But his (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) shout
had been heard in the corridor outside; next second, Cornelius Fudge and
Snape had entered the ward.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Harry, Harry, what's this?''  (<font color='red'><b>Fudge</b></font>)</div>said Fudge, looking agitated. <div class="bookquote">``You should
be in bed -- has he (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) had any chocolate?''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Fudge</b></font>) asked Madam Pomfrey
anxiously.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Minister, listen!''  (<font color='red'><b>Harry/Potter/Harry Potter</b></font>)</div>Harry said. <div class="bookquote">``Sirius Black's innocent! Peter
Pettigrew faked his (<font color='blue'><b>Pettigrew</b></font>) own death! We saw him (<font color='blue'><b>Pettigrew</b></font>) tonight! You can't let the
dementors do that thing to Sirius, he (<font color='blue'><b>Sirius</b></font>)'s --''

 (<font color='red'><b>Fudge</b></font>)</div><p/>But Fudge was shaking his (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) head with a small smile on his (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) face.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Harry, Harry, you're very confused, you've been through a dreadful
ordeal, lie back down, now, we've got everything under control...''

 (<font color='red'><b>Harry/Potter/Harry Potter</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``YOU HAVEN'T!''  (<font color='red'><b>Harry/Potter/Harry Potter</b></font>)</div>Harry yelled. <div class="bookquote">``YOUVE GOT THE WRONG MAN!''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Minister, listen, please,''  (<font color='red'><b>Hermione/HERMIONE</b></font>)</div>Hermione said; she (<font color='blue'><b>Hermione</b></font>) had hurried to Harry's
side and was gazing imploringly into Fudge's face. <div class="bookquote">``I saw him (<font color='blue'><b>Minister</b></font>) too. It
was Ron's rat, he (<font color='blue'><b>Ron</b></font>)'s an Animagus, Pettigrew, I mean, and --''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``You see, Minister?''  (<font color='red'><b>Snape/Severus/Severus Snape</b></font>)</div>said Snape. <div class="bookquote">``Confunded, both of them... Black's
done a very good job on them...''  (<font color='red'><b>Harry/Potter/Harry Potter</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``WE'RE NOT CONFUNDED!''  (<font color='red'><b>Harry/Potter/Harry Potter</b></font>)</div>Harry roared.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Minister! Professor!''  (<font color='red'><b>Madam Pomfrey</b></font>)</div>said Madam Pomfrey angrily. <div class="bookquote">``I must insist that
you leave. Potter is my patient, and he (<font color='blue'><b>Potter</b></font>) should not be distressed!''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I'm not distressed, I'm trying to tell them what happened!''  (<font color='red'><b>Harry/Potter/Harry Potter</b></font>)</div>Harry said
furiously. <div class="bookquote">``If they'd just listen --''

 (<font color='red'><b>Madam Pomfrey</b></font>)</div><p/>But Madam Pomfrey suddenly stuffed a large chunk of chocolate into
Harry's mouth; he (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) choked, and she (<font color='blue'><b>Pomfrey</b></font>) seized the opportunity to force him (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>)
back onto the bed.

<p/>``Now, please, Minister, these children need care. Please leave

<p/>The door opened again. It was Dumbledore. Harry swallowed his (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) mouthful
of chocolate with great difficulty and got up again.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Professor Dumbledore, Sirius Black --''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``For heaven's sake!''  (<font color='red'><b>Madam Pomfrey</b></font>)</div>said Madam Pomfrey hysterically. <div class="bookquote">``Is this a
hospital wing or not? Headmaster, I must insist --''

 (<font color='red'><b>Dumbledore/Albus Dumbledore</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``My apologies, Poppy, but I need a word with Mr. Potter and Miss
Granger,''  (<font color='red'><b>Dumbledore/Albus Dumbledore</b></font>)</div>said Dumbledore calmly. <div class="bookquote">``I have just been talking to Sirius
Black --''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I suppose he (<font color='blue'><b>Black</b></font>)'s told you the same fairy tale he (<font color='blue'><b>Black</b></font>)'s planted in Potter's
mind?''  (<font color='red'><b>Snape/Severus/Severus Snape</b></font>)</div>spat Snape. <div class="bookquote">``Something about a rat, and Pettigrew being alive --''

 (<font color='red'><b>Dumbledore/Albus Dumbledore</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``That, indeed, is Black's story,''  (<font color='red'><b>Dumbledore/Albus Dumbledore</b></font>)</div>said Dumbledore, surveying Snape
closely through his (<font color='blue'><b>Dumbledore</b></font>) half-moon spectacles.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``And does my evidence count for nothing?''  (<font color='red'><b>Snape/Severus/Severus Snape</b></font>)</div>snarled Snape. <div class="bookquote">``Peter
Pettigrew was not in the Shrieking Shack, nor did I see any sign of him (<font color='blue'><b>Pettigrew</b></font>)
on the grounds.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``That was because you were knocked out, Professor!''  (<font color='red'><b>Hermione/HERMIONE</b></font>)</div>said Hermione
earnestly. ``You didn't arrive in time to hear

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Miss Granger, HOLD YOUR TONGUE!''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Now, Snape,''  (<font color='red'><b>Fudge</b></font>)</div>said Fudge, startled, <div class="bookquote">``the young lady is disturbed in her (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>)
mind, we must make allowances --''

 (<font color='red'><b>Fudge</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I would like to speak to Harry and Hermione alone,''  (<font color='red'><b>Fudge</b></font>)</div>said Dumbledore
abruptly. <div class="bookquote">``Cornelius, Severus, Poppy -- please leave us.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Headmaster!''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>sputtered Madam Pomfrey. <div class="bookquote">``They need treatment, they need
rest --''

 (<font color='red'><b>Dumbledore/Albus Dumbledore</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``This cannot wait,''  (<font color='red'><b>Dumbledore/Albus Dumbledore</b></font>)</div>said Dumbledore. <div class="bookquote">``I must insist.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Madam Pomfrey</b></font>)</div><p/>Madam Pomfrey pursed her (<font color='blue'><b>Pomfrey</b></font>) lips and strode away into her (<font color='blue'><b>Pomfrey</b></font>) office at the end
of the ward, slamming the door behind her (<font color='blue'><b>Pomfrey</b></font>). Fudge consulted the large
gold pocket watch dangling from his (<font color='blue'><b>Dumbledore</b></font>) waistcoat.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``The dementors should have arrived by now,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Dumbledore</b></font>) said. <div class="bookquote">``I'll go and meet
them. Dumbledore, I'll see you upstairs.''

 (<font color='red'><b>He</b></font>)</div><p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Dumbledore</b></font>) crossed to the door and held it open for Snape, but Snape hadn't
moved.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``You surely don't believe a word of Black's story?''  (<font color='red'><b>Snape/Severus/Severus Snape</b></font>)</div>Snape whispered, his (<font color='blue'><b>Snape</b></font>)
eyes fixed on Dumbledore's face.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``I wish to speak to Harry and Hermione alone,''  (<font color='red'><b>Dumbledore/Albus Dumbledore</b></font>)</div>Dumbledore repeated.

<p/>Snape took a step toward Dumbledore.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Sirius Black showed he (<font color='blue'><b>Black</b></font>) was capable of murder at the age of sixteen,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Dumbledore</b></font>)
breathed. <div class="bookquote">``You haven't forgotten that, Headmaster? You haven't forgotten
that he (<font color='blue'><b>Headmaster</b></font>) once tried to kill me?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``My memory is as good as it ever was, Severus,''  (<font color='red'><b>Dumbledore/Albus Dumbledore</b></font>)</div>said Dumbledore quietly.

<p/>Snape turned on his (<font color='blue'><b>Dumbledore</b></font>) heel and marched through the door Fudge was still
holding. It closed behind them, and Dumbledore turned to Harry and
Hermione. They both burst into speech at the same time.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Professor, Black's telling the truth -- we saw Pettigrew '' (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>-- he (<font color='blue'><b>Dumbledore</b></font>) escaped
when Professor Lupin turned into a werewolf --''

<p/><div class="bookquote">''-- he (<font color='blue'><b>Dumbledore</b></font>)'s a rat --''

 (<font color='red'><b>a werewolf</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">''-- Pettigrew's front paw, I mean, finger, he (<font color='blue'><b>Pettigrew</b></font>) cut it off --''

 (<font color='red'><b>a werewolf</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">''-- Pettigrew attacked Ron, it wasn't Sirius --''

 (<font color='red'><b>a werewolf</b></font>)</div><p/>But Dumbledore held up his (<font color='blue'><b>Dumbledore</b></font>) hand to stem the flood of explanations.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``It is your turn to listen, and I beg you will not interrupt me, because
there is very little time,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Dumbledore</b></font>) said quietly. <div class="bookquote">``There is not a shred of
proof to support Black's story, except your word -- and the word of two
thirteen-year-old wizards will not convince anybody. A street full of
eyewitnesses swore they saw Sirius murder Pettigrew. I myself gave
evidence to the Ministry that Sirius had been the Potters'
Secret-Keeper.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Professor Lupin can tell you --''  (<font color='red'><b>Harry/Potter/Harry Potter</b></font>)</div>Harry said, unable to stop himself

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Professor Lupin is currently deep in the forest, unable to tell anyone
anything. By the time he (<font color='blue'><b>Professor</b></font>) is human again, it will be too late, Sirius
will be worse than dead. I might add that werewolves are so mistrusted
by most of our kind that his (<font color='blue'><b>Sirius</b></font>) support will count for very little -- and
the fact that he (<font color='blue'><b>Sirius</b></font>) and Sirius are old friends --''

 (<font color='red'><b>Harry/Potter/Harry Potter</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``But --''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Listen to me, Harry. It is too late, you understand me? You must see
that Professor Snape's version of events is far more convincing than
yours.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``He (<font color='blue'><b>Snape</b></font>) hates Sirius,''  (<font color='red'><b>Hermione/HERMIONE</b></font>)</div>Hermione said desperately. <div class="bookquote">``All because of some
stupid trick Sirius played on him (<font color='blue'><b>Sirius</b></font>) --''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Sirius has not acted like an innocent man. The attack on the Fat Lady
-- entering Gryffindor Tower with a knife -- without Pettigrew, alive or
dead, we have no chance of overturning Sirius's sentence.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``But you believe us.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Yes, I do,''  (<font color='red'><b>Dumbledore/Albus Dumbledore</b></font>)</div>said Dumbledore quietly. <div class="bookquote">``But I have no power to make other
men see the truth, or to overrule the Minister of Magic...''

 (<font color='red'><b>Harry/Potter/Harry Potter</b></font>)</div><p/>Harry stared up into the grave face and felt as though the ground
beneath him (<font color='blue'><b>Dumbledore</b></font>) were falling sharply away. He (<font color='blue'><b>Dumbledore</b></font>) had grown used to the idea
that Dumbledore could solve anything. He (<font color='blue'><b>Dumbledore</b></font>) had expected Dumbledore to pull
some amazing solution out of the air. But no ... their last hope was
gone.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``What we need,''  (<font color='red'><b>Dumbledore/Albus Dumbledore</b></font>)</div>said Dumbledore slowly, and his (<font color='blue'><b>Dumbledore</b></font>) light blue eyes moved
from Harry to Hermione, <div class="bookquote">``is more time.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Hermione/HERMIONE</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``But --''  (<font color='red'><b>Hermione/HERMIONE</b></font>)</div>Hermione began. And then her (<font color='blue'><b>Hermione</b></font>) eyes became very round. <div class="bookquote">``OH!''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Now, pay attention,''  (<font color='red'><b>Dumbledore/Albus Dumbledore</b></font>)</div>said Dumbledore, speaking very low, and very
clearly. <div class="bookquote">``Sirius is locked in Professor Flitwick's office on the seventh
floor. Thirteenth window from the right of the West Tower. If all goes
well, you will be able to save more than one innocent life tonight. But
remember this, both of you: you must not be seen. Miss Granger, you know
the law -- you know what is at stake... You -- must -- not -- be --
seen.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Harry/Potter/Harry Potter</b></font>)</div><p/>Harry didn't have a clue what was going on. Dumbledore had turned on his (<font color='blue'><b>Dumbledore</b></font>)
heel and looked back as he (<font color='blue'><b>Dumbledore</b></font>) reached the door.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``I am going to lock you in. It is --''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Dumbledore</b></font>) consulted his (<font color='blue'><b>Dumbledore</b></font>) watch, <div class="bookquote">``five
minutes to midnight. Miss Granger, three turns should do it. Good luck.''

 (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Good luck?''  (<font color='red'><b>Harry</b></font>)</div>Harry repeated as the door closed behind Dumbledore. <div class="bookquote">``Three
turns? What's he (<font color='blue'><b>it</b></font>) talking about? What are we supposed to do?''

 (<font color='red'><b>Hermione/HERMIONE</b></font>)</div><p/>But Hermione was fumbling with the neck of her (<font color='blue'><b>Hermione</b></font>) robes, pulling from
beneath them a very long, very fine gold chain.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Harry, come here,''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Hermione</b></font>) said urgently. <div class="bookquote">``Quick!''

 (<font color='red'><b>Harry/Potter/Harry Potter</b></font>)</div><p/>Harry moved toward her (<font color='blue'><b>Hermione</b></font>), completely bewildered. She (<font color='blue'><b>Hermione</b></font>) was holding the chain
out. He (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) saw a tiny, sparkling hourglass hanging from it.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Here --''

 (<font color='red'><b>She</b></font>)</div><p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>Hermione</b></font>) had thrown the chain around his (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) neck too.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Ready?''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Hermione</b></font>) said breathlessly.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``What are we doing?''  (<font color='red'><b>Harry/Potter/Harry Potter</b></font>)</div>Harry said, completely lost.

<p/>Hermione turned the hourglass over three times.

<p/>The dark ward dissolved. Harry had the sensation that he (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) was flying very
fast, backward. A blur of colors and shapes rushed past him (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>), his (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) ears
were pounding, he (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) tried to yell but couldn't hear his (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) own voice --

<p/>And then he (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) felt solid ground beneath his (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) feet, and everything came into
focus again --

<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) was standing next to Hermione in the deserted entrance hall and a
stream of golden sunlight was falling across the paved floor from the
open front doors. He (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) looked wildly around at Hermione, the chain of the
hourglass cutting into his (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) neck.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Hermione, what --?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``In here!''  (<font color='red'><b>Hermione/HERMIONE</b></font>)</div>Hermione seized Harry's arm and dragged him (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) across the hall
to the door of a broom closet; she (<font color='blue'><b>Hermione</b></font>) opened it, pushed him (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) inside among
the buckets and mops, then slammed the door behind them.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``What -- how -- Hermione, what happened?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``We've gone back in time,''  (<font color='red'><b>Hermione/HERMIONE</b></font>)</div>Hermione whispered, lifting the chain off
Harry's neck in the darkness. <div class="bookquote">``Three hours back...''

 (<font color='red'><b>Harry/Potter/Harry Potter</b></font>)</div><p/>Harry found his (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) own leg and gave it a very hard pinch. It hurt a lot,
which seemed to rule out the possibility that he (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) was having a very
bizarre dream.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``But --''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Shh! Listen! Someone's coming! I think -- I think it might be us!''
 (<font color='red'><b>Hermione/HERMIONE</b></font>)</div>Hermione had her (<font color='blue'><b>Hermione</b></font>) ear pressed against the cupboard door.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Footsteps across the hall... yes, I think it's us going down to
Hagrid's!''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Are you telling me,''  (<font color='red'><b>Harry/Potter/Harry Potter</b></font>)</div>Harry whispered, <div class="bookquote">``that we're here in this cupboard
and we're out there too?''

 (<font color='red'><b>Harry/Potter/Harry Potter</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Yes,''  (<font color='red'><b>Hermione/HERMIONE</b></font>)</div>said Hermione, her (<font color='blue'><b>Hermione</b></font>) ear still glued to the cupboard door. <div class="bookquote">``I'm
sure it's us. It doesn't sound like more than three people... and we're
walking slowly because we're under the Invisibility Cloak -- ''

 (<font color='red'><b>She</b></font>)</div><p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>Hermione</b></font>) broke off, still listening intently.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``We've gone down the front steps...''

 (<font color='red'><b>Hermione/HERMIONE</b></font>)</div><p/>Hermione sat down on an upturned bucket, looking desperately anxious,
but Harry wanted a few questions answered.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Where did you get that hourglass thing?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``It's called a Time-Turner,''  (<font color='red'><b>Hermione/HERMIONE</b></font>)</div>Hermione whispered, ``and I got it from
Professor McGonagall on our first day back. I've been using it all year
to get to all my lessons. Professor McGonagall made me swear I wouldn't
tell anyone. She (<font color='blue'><b>us</b></font>) had to write all sorts of letters to the Ministry of
Magic so I could have one. She (<font color='blue'><b>us</b></font>) had to tell them that I was a model
student, and that I'd never, ever use it for anything except my
studies... I've been turning it back so I could do hours over again,
that's how I've been doing several lessons at once, see? But...

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Harry, I don't understand what Dumbledore wants us to do. Why did he (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>)
tell us to go back three hours? How's that going to help Sirius?''

 (<font color='red'><b>Harry/Potter/Harry Potter</b></font>)</div><p/>Harry stared at her (<font color='blue'><b>Hermione</b></font>) shadowy face.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``There must be something that happened around now he (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) wants us to
change,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) said slowly. <div class="bookquote">``What happened? We were walking down to
Hagrid's three hours ago...''

 (<font color='red'><b>Hermione/HERMIONE</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``This is three hours ago, and we are walking down to Hagrid's,''  (<font color='red'><b>Hermione/HERMIONE</b></font>)</div>said
Hermione. <div class="bookquote">``We just heard ourselves leaving...''

 (<font color='red'><b>Harry/Potter/Harry Potter</b></font>)</div><p/>Harry frowned; he (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) felt as though he (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) were screwing up his (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) whole brain in
concentration.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Dumbledore just said -- just said we could save more than one innocent
life...''  (<font color='red'><b>him</b></font>)</div>And then it hit him (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>). <div class="bookquote">``Hermione, we're going to save Buckbeak!''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``But -- how will that help Sirius?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Dumbledore said -- he (<font color='blue'><b>Dumbledore</b></font>) just told us where the window is -- the window of
Flitwick's office! Where they've got Sirius locked up! We've got to fly
Buckbeak up to the window and rescue Sirius! Sirius can escape on
Buckbeak -- they can escape together!''

 (<font color='red'><b>Harry/Potter/Harry Potter</b></font>)</div><p/>From what Harry could see of Hermione's face, she (<font color='blue'><b>Hermione</b></font>) looked terrified.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``If we manage that without being seen, it'll be a miracle!''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Well, we've got to try, haven't we?''  (<font color='red'><b>Harry/Potter/Harry Potter</b></font>)</div>said Harry. He (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) stood up and
pressed his (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) ear against the door. <div class="bookquote">``Doesn't sound like anyone's there...
Come on, let's go.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Harry/Potter/Harry Potter</b></font>)</div><p/>Harry pushed open the closet door. The entrance hall was deserted. As
quietly and quickly as they could, they darted out of the closet and
down the stone steps. The shadows were already lengthening, the tops of
the trees in the Forbidden Forest gilded once more with gold.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``If anyone's looking out of the window --''  (<font color='red'><b>Hermione/HERMIONE</b></font>)</div>Hermione squeaked, looking up
at the castle behind them.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``We'll run for it,''  (<font color='red'><b>Harry/Potter/Harry Potter</b></font>)</div>said Harry determinedly. <div class="bookquote">``Straight into the forest,
all right? We'll have to hide behind a tree or something and keep a
lookout --''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Okay, but we'll go around by the greenhouses!''  (<font color='red'><b>Hermione/HERMIONE</b></font>)</div>said Hermione
breathlessly. <div class="bookquote">``We need to keep out of sight of Hagrid's front door, or
we'll see us! We must be nearly at Hagrid's by now!''

 (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div><p/>Still working out what she (<font color='blue'><b>Hermione</b></font>) meant, Harry set off at a sprint, Hermione
behind him (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>). They tore across the vegetable gardens to the greenhouses,
paused for a moment behind them, then set off again, fast as they could,
skirting around the Whomping Willow, tearing toward the shelter of the
forest...

<p/>Safe in the shadows of the trees, Harry turned around; seconds later,
Hermione arrived beside him (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>), panting.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Right,''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Hermione</b></font>) gasped. <div class="bookquote">``We need to sneak over to Hagrid's... Keep out of
sight, Harry...''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/>They made their way silently through the trees, keeping to the very edge
of the forest. Then, as they glimpsed the front of Hagrid's house, they
heard a knock upon his (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) door. They moved quickly behind a wide oak trunk
and peered out from either side. Hagrid had appeared in his (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) doorway,
shaking and white, looking around to see who had knocked. And Harry
heard his (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) own voice.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``It's us. We're wearing the Invisibility Cloak. Let us in and we can
take it off.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Yeh shouldn've come!''  (<font color='red'><b>Hagrid</b></font>)</div>Hagrid whispered. He (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) stood back, then shut the
door quickly.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``This is the weirdest thing we've ever done,''  (<font color='red'><b>Harry/Potter/Harry Potter</b></font>)</div>Harry said fervently.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Let's move along a bit,''  (<font color='red'><b>Hermione/HERMIONE</b></font>)</div>Hermione whispered. <div class="bookquote">``We need to get nearer to
Buckbeak!''

 (<font color='red'><b>Hagrid</b></font>)</div><p/>They crept through the trees until they saw the nervous hippogriff,
tethered to the fence around Hagrid's pumpkin patch.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Now?''  (<font color='red'><b>Harry/Potter/Harry Potter</b></font>)</div>Harry whispered.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``No!''  (<font color='red'><b>Hermione/HERMIONE</b></font>)</div>said Hermione. <div class="bookquote">``If we steal him (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) now, those Committee people will
think Hagrid set him (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) free! We've got to wait until they've seen he (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>)'s
tied outside!''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``That's going to give us about sixty seconds,''  (<font color='red'><b>Harry/Potter/Harry Potter</b></font>)</div>said Harry. This was
starting to seem impossible.

<p/>At that moment, there was a crash of breaking china from inside Hagrid's
cabin.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``That's Hagrid breaking the milk jug,''  (<font color='red'><b>Hermione/HERMIONE</b></font>)</div>Hermione whispered. <div class="bookquote">``I'm going to
find Scabbers in a moment --''

 (<font color='red'><b>Hermione/HERMIONE</b></font>)</div><p/>Sure enough, a few minutes later, they heard Hermione's shriek of
surprise.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Hermione,''  (<font color='red'><b>Harry/Potter/Harry Potter</b></font>)</div>said Harry suddenly, <div class="bookquote">``what if we -- we just run in there and
grab Pettigrew --''

 (<font color='red'><b>Harry/Potter/Harry Potter</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``No!''  (<font color='red'><b>Harry/Potter/Harry Potter</b></font>)</div>said Hermione in a terrified whisper. <div class="bookquote">``Don't you understand? We're
breaking one of the most important wizarding laws! Nobody's supposed to
change time, nobody! You heard Dumbledore, if we're seen --''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``We'd only be seen by ourselves and Hagrid!''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Harry, what do you think you'd do if you saw yourself bursting into
Hagrid's house?''  (<font color='red'><b>Hermione/HERMIONE</b></font>)</div>said Hermione.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``I'd -- I'd think I'd gone mad,''  (<font color='red'><b>Harry/Potter/Harry Potter</b></font>)</div>said Harry, <div class="bookquote">``or I'd think there was
some Dark Magic going on --''

 (<font color='red'><b>Harry/Potter/Harry Potter</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Exactly! You wouldn't understand, you might even attack yourself! Don't
you see? Professor McGonagall told me what awful things have happened
when wizards have meddled with time... Loads of them ended up killing
their past or future selves by mistake!''

 (<font color='red'><b>Harry/Potter/Harry Potter</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Okay!''  (<font color='red'><b>Harry/Potter/Harry Potter</b></font>)</div>said Harry. ``It was just an idea, I just thought

<p/>But Hermione nudged him (<font color='blue'><b>Professor</b></font>) and pointed toward the castle. Harry moved his (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>)
head a few inches to get a clear view of the distant front doors.
Dumbledore, Fudge, the old Committee member, and Macnair the executioner
were coming down the steps.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``We're about to come out!''  (<font color='red'><b>Hermione/HERMIONE</b></font>)</div>Hermione breathed.

<p/>And sure enough, moments later, Hagrid's back door opened, and Harry saw
himself, Ron, and Hermione walking out of it with Hagrid. It was,
without a doubt, the strangest sensation of his (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) life, standing behind
the tree, and watching himself in the pumpkin patch.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``It's Okay, Beaky, it's okay...''  (<font color='red'><b>Hagrid</b></font>)</div>Hagrid said to Buckbeak. Then he (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) turned
to Harry, Ron, and Hermione. <div class="bookquote">``Go on. Get goin'.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Hagrid, we can't --''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/>``We'll tell them what really happened

<p/><div class="bookquote">``They can't kill him (<font color='blue'><b>executioner</b></font>) --''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Go! It's bad enough without you lot in trouble an' all!''

 (<font color='red'><b>Harry/Potter/Harry Potter</b></font>)</div><p/>Harry watched the Hermione in the pumpkin patch throw the Invisibility
Cloak over him (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) and Ron.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Go quick. Don' listen...''

 (<font color='red'><b>Hagrid</b></font>)</div><p/>There was a knock on Hagrid's front door. The execution party had
arrived. Hagrid turned, around and headed back into his (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) cabin, leaving
the back door ajar. Harry watched the grass flatten in patches all
around the cabin and heard three pairs of feet retreating. He (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>), Ron, and
Hermione had gone... but the Harry and Hermione hidden in the trees
could now hear what was happening inside the cabin through the back
door.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Where is the beast?''  (<font color='red'><b>Macnair</b></font>)</div>came the cold voice of Macnair.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Out -- outside,''  (<font color='red'><b>Hagrid</b></font>)</div>Hagrid croaked.

<p/>Harry pulled his (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) head out of sight as Macnair's face appeared at
Hagrid's window, staring out at Buckbeak. Then they heard Fudge.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``We -- er -- have to read you the official notice of execution, Hagrid.
I'll make it quick. And then you and Macnair need to sign it. Macnair,
You're supposed to listen too, that's procedure --''

 (<font color='red'><b>Macnair</b></font>)</div><p/>Macnair's face vanished from the window. It was now or never.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Wait here,''  (<font color='red'><b>Harry/Potter/Harry Potter</b></font>)</div>Harry whispered to Hermione. <div class="bookquote">``I'll do it.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Fudge</b></font>)</div><p/>As Fudge's voice started again, Harry darted out from behind his (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) tree,
vaulted the fence into the pumpkin patch, and approached Buckbeak.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``It is the decision of the Committee for the Disposal of Dangerous
Creatures that the hippogriff Buckbeak, hereafter called the condemned,
shall he (<font color='blue'><b>Don</b></font>) executed on the sixth of June at sundown --''

 (<font color='red'><b>Harry/Potter/Harry Potter</b></font>)</div><p/>Careful not to blink, Harry stared up into Buckbeak's fierce orange eyes
once more and bowed. Buckbeak sank to his (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) scaly knees and then stood up
again. Harry began to fumble with the knot of rope tying Buckbeak to the
fence.

<p/><div class="bookquote">''... sentenced to execution by beheading, to be carried out by the
Committee's appointed executioner, Walden Macnai...''

 (<font color='red'><b>Harry/Potter/Harry Potter</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Come on, Buckbeak,''  (<font color='red'><b>Harry/Potter/Harry Potter</b></font>)</div>Harry murmured, <div class="bookquote">``come on, we're going to help you.
Quietly... quietly...''

 (<font color='red'><b>Harry/Potter/Harry Potter</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">''... as witnessed below. Hagrid, you sign here...''

 (<font color='red'><b>Harry/Potter/Harry Potter</b></font>)</div><p/>Harry threw all his (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) weight onto the rope, but Buckbeak had dug in his (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>)
front feet.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Well, let's get this over with,''  (<font color='red'><b>the Committee member</b></font>)</div>said the reedy voice of the Committee
member from inside Hagrid's cabin. <div class="bookquote">``Hagrid, perhaps it will be better if
you stay inside --''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``No, I -- I wan' ter be with him (<font color='blue'><b>Don</b></font>)... I don' wan' him (<font color='blue'><b>Don</b></font>) ter be alone --''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/>Footsteps echoed from within the cabin.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Buckbeak, move!''  (<font color='red'><b>Harry/Potter/Harry Potter</b></font>)</div>Harry hissed.

<p/>Harry tugged harder on the rope around Buckbeak's neck. The hippogriff
began to walk, rustling its wings irritably. They were still ten feet
away from the forest, in plain view of Hagrid's back door. <div class="bookquote">``One moment,
please, Macnair,''  (<font color='red'><b>Dumbledore/Albus Dumbledore</b></font>)</div>came Dumbledore's voice. <div class="bookquote">``You need to sign too.''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>The
footsteps stopped. Harry heaved on the rope. Buckbeak snapped his (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) beak
and walked a little faster.

<p/>Hermione's white face was sticking out from behind a tree.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Harry, hurry!''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Hermione</b></font>) mouthed.

<p/>Harry could still hear Dumbledore's voice talking from within the cabin.
He (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) gave the rope another wrench. Buckbeak broke into a grudging trot.
They had reached the trees...

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Quick! Quick!''  (<font color='red'><b>Hermione/HERMIONE</b></font>)</div>Hermione moaned, darting out from behind her (<font color='blue'><b>Hermione</b></font>) tree,
seizing the rope too and adding her (<font color='blue'><b>Hermione</b></font>) weight to make Buckbeak move faster.
Harry looked over his (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) shoulder; they were now blocked from sight; they
couldn't see Hagrid's garden at all.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Stop!''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) whispered to Hermione. ``They might hear us

<p/>Hagrid's back door had opened with a bang. Harry, Hermione, and Buckbeak
stood quite still; even the hippogriff seemed to be listening intently.

<p/>Silence... then --

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Where is it?''  (<font color='red'><b>the Committee member</b></font>)</div>said the reedy voice of the Committee member. <div class="bookquote">``Where is
the beast?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``It was tied here!''  (<font color='red'><b>the executioner</b></font>)</div>said the executioner furiously. I saw it! just
here!''

<p/><div class="bookquote">``How extraordinary,''  (<font color='red'><b>Dumbledore/Albus Dumbledore</b></font>)</div>said Dumbledore. There was a note of amusement in
his (<font color='blue'><b>Dumbledore</b></font>) voice.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Beaky!''  (<font color='red'><b>Hagrid</b></font>)</div>said Hagrid huskily.

<p/>There was a swishing noise, and the thud of an axe. The executioner
seemed to have swung it into the fence in anger. And then came the
howling, and this time they could hear Hagrid's words through his (<font color='blue'><b>executioner</b></font>) sobs.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Gone! Gone! Bless his (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) little beak, he (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>)'s gone! Musta pulled himself
free! Beaky, yeh clever boy!''

 (<font color='red'><b>Buckbeak</b></font>)</div><p/>Buckbeak started to strain against the rope, trying to get back to
Hagrid. Harry and Hermione tightened their grip and dug their heels into
the forest floor to stop him (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>).

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Someone untied him (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>)!''  (<font color='red'><b>the executioner</b></font>)</div>the executioner was snarling. <div class="bookquote">``We should search
the grounds, the forest.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Macnair, if Buckbeak has indeed been stolen, do you really think the
thief will have led him (<font color='blue'><b>thief</b></font>) away on foot?''  (<font color='red'><b>Dumbledore/Albus Dumbledore</b></font>)</div>said Dumbledore, still sounding
amused. <div class="bookquote">``Search the skies, if you will... Hagrid, I could do with a cup
of tea. Or a large brandy.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``O' -- o' course, Professor,''  (<font color='red'><b>Hagrid</b></font>)</div>said Hagrid, who sounded weak with
happiness. <div class="bookquote">``Come in, come in...''

 (<font color='red'><b>Harry/Potter/Harry Potter</b></font>)</div><p/>Harry and Hermione listened closely. They heard footsteps, the soft
cursing of the executioner, the snap of the door, and then silence once
more.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Now what?''  (<font color='red'><b>Harry/Potter/Harry Potter</b></font>)</div>whispered Harry, looking around.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``We'll have to hide in here,''  (<font color='red'><b>Hermione/HERMIONE</b></font>)</div>said Hermione, who looked very shaken. <div class="bookquote">``We
need to wait until they've gone back to the castle. Then we wait until
it's safe to fly Buckbeak up to Sirius's window. He (<font color='blue'><b>Sirius</b></font>) won't be there for
another couple of hours... Oh, this is going to be difficult...''

 (<font color='red'><b>She</b></font>)</div><p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>Hermione</b></font>) looked nervously over her (<font color='blue'><b>Hermione</b></font>) shoulder into the depths of the forest.
The sun was setting now.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``We're going to have to move,''  (<font color='red'><b>Harry/Potter/Harry Potter</b></font>)</div>said Harry, thinking hard. <div class="bookquote">``We've got to
be able to see the Whomping Willow, or we won't know what's going on.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Okay,''  (<font color='red'><b>Hermione/HERMIONE</b></font>)</div>said Hermione, getting a firmer grip on Buckbeak's rope. <div class="bookquote">``But
we've got to keep out of sight, Harry, remember...''

 (<font color='red'><b>the Willow</b></font>)</div><p/>They moved around the edge of the forest, darkness falling thickly
around them, until they were hidden behind a clump of trees through
which they could make out the Willow.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``There's Ron!''  (<font color='red'><b>Harry/Potter/Harry Potter</b></font>)</div>said Harry suddenly.

<p/>A dark figure was sprinting across the lawn and its shout echoed through
the still night air.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Get away from him (<font color='blue'><b>Ron</b></font>) -- get away -- Scabbers, come here --''

 (<font color='red'><b>Harry/Potter/Harry Potter</b></font>)</div><p/>And then they saw two more figures materialize out of nowhere. Harry
watched himself and Hermione chasing after Ron. Then he (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) saw Ron dive.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Gotcha! Get off, you stinking cat --''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``There's Sirius!''  (<font color='red'><b>Harry/Potter/Harry Potter</b></font>)</div>said Harry. The great shape of the dog had bounded out
from the roots of the Willow. They saw him (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) bowl Harry over, then seize
Ron...

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Looks even worse from here, doesn't it?''  (<font color='red'><b>Ron</b></font>)</div>said Harry, watching the dog
pulling Ron into the roots. <div class="bookquote">``Ouch -- look, I just got walloped by the
tree -- and so did you -- this is weird--''

 (<font color='red'><b>The Whomping Willow</b></font>)</div><p/>The Whomping Willow was creaking and lashing out with its lower
branches; they could see themselves darting here and there, trying to
reach the trunk. And then the tree froze.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``That was Crookshanks pressing the knot,''  (<font color='red'><b>Hermione/HERMIONE</b></font>)</div>said Hermione.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``And there we go...''  (<font color='red'><b>Harry/Potter/Harry Potter</b></font>)</div>Harry muttered. <div class="bookquote">``We're in.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/>The moment they disappeared, the tree began to move again. Seconds
later, they heard footsteps quite close by. Dumbledore, Macnair, Fudge,
and the old Committee member were making their way up to the castle.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Right after we'd gone down into the passage!''  (<font color='red'><b>Hermione/HERMIONE</b></font>)</div>said Hermione. <div class="bookquote">``If only
Dumbledore had come with us...''

 (<font color='red'><b>Harry/Potter/Harry Potter</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Macnair and Fudge would've come too,''  (<font color='red'><b>Harry/Potter/Harry Potter</b></font>)</div>said Harry bitterly. <div class="bookquote">``I bet you
anything Fudge would've told Macnair to murder Sirius on the spot...''

 (<font color='red'><b>the men</b></font>)</div><p/>They watched the four men climb the castle steps and disappear from
view. For a few minutes the scene was deserted. Then --

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Here comes Lupin!''  (<font color='red'><b>Harry/Potter/Harry Potter</b></font>)</div>said Harry as they saw another figure sprinting down
the stone steps and hating toward the Willow. Harry looked up at the
sky. Clouds were obscuring the moon completely.

<p/>They watched Lupin seize a broken branch from the ground and prod the
knot on the trunk. The tree stopped fighting, and Lupin, too,
disappeared into the gap in its roots.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``If he (<font color='blue'><b>Sirius</b></font>)'d only grabbed the cloak,''  (<font color='red'><b>Harry/Potter/Harry Potter</b></font>)</div>said Harry. <div class="bookquote">``It's just lying
there...''

 (<font color='red'><b>He</b></font>)</div><p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) turned to Hermione.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``If I just dashed out now and grabbed it, Snape'd never be able to get
it and --''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Harry, we mustn't be seen!''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``How can you stand this?''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) asked Hermione fiercely. <div class="bookquote">``Just standing
here and watching it happen?''  (<font color='red'><b>He</b></font>)</div>He (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) hesitated. <div class="bookquote">``I'm going to grab the
cloak!''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Harry, no!''

 (<font color='red'><b>Hermione/HERMIONE</b></font>)</div><p/>Hermione seized the back of Harry's robes not a moment too soon. just
then, they heard a burst of song. It was Hagrid, making his (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) way up to
the castle, singing at the top of his (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) voice, and weaving slightly as he (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>)
walked. A large bottle was swinging from his (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) hands.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``See?''  (<font color='red'><b>Hermione/HERMIONE</b></font>)</div>Hermione whispered. <div class="bookquote">``See what would have happened? We've got to
keep out of sight! No, Buckbeak!''

 (<font color='red'><b>Hagrid</b></font>)</div><p/>The hippogriff was making frantic attempts to get to Hagrid again; Harry
seized his (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) rope too, straining to hold Buckbeak back. They watched
Hagrid meander tipsily up to the castle. He (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) was gone. Buckbeak stopped
fighting to get away. His (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) head drooped sadly.

<p/>Barely two minutes later, the castle doors flew open yet again, and
Snape came charging out of them, running toward the Willow.

<p/>Harry's fists clenched as they watched Snape skid to a halt next to the
tree, looking around. He (<font color='blue'><b>Snape</b></font>) grabbed the cloak and held it up.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Get your filthy hands off it,''  (<font color='red'><b>Harry/Potter/Harry Potter</b></font>)</div>Harry snarled under his (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) breath. <div class="bookquote">``Shh!''

 (<font color='red'><b>Snape/Severus/Severus Snape</b></font>)</div><p/>Snape seized the branch Lupin had used to freeze the tree, prodded the
knot, and vanished from view as he (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) put on the cloak.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``So that's it,''  (<font color='red'><b>Hermione/HERMIONE</b></font>)</div>said Hermione quietly. <div class="bookquote">``We're all down there... and now
we've just got to wait until we come back up again...''

 (<font color='red'><b>She</b></font>)</div><p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>Hermione</b></font>) took the end of Buckbeak's rope and tied it securely around the
nearest tree, then sat down on the dry ground, arms around her (<font color='blue'><b>Hermione</b></font>) knees.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Harry, there's something I don't understand... Why didn't the
dementors get Sirius? I remember them coming, and then I think I passed
out... there were so many of them...''

 (<font color='red'><b>Harry/Potter/Harry Potter</b></font>)</div><p/>Harry sat down too. He (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) explained what he (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>)'d seen; how, as the nearest
dementor had lowered its mouth to Harry's, a large silver something had
come galloping across the lake and forced the dementors to retreat.

<p/>Hermione's mouth was slightly open by the time Harry had finished.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``But what was it?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``There's only one thing it could have been, to make the dementors go,''
 (<font color='red'><b>Harry/Potter/Harry Potter</b></font>)</div>said Harry. <div class="bookquote">``A real Patronus. A powerful one.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``But who conjured it?''

 (<font color='red'><b>Harry/Potter/Harry Potter</b></font>)</div><p/>Harry didn't say anything. He (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) was thinking back to the person he (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>)'d seen
on the other bank of the lake. He (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) knew who he (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) thought it had been... but
how could it have been?

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Didn't you see what they looked like?''  (<font color='red'><b>Hermione/HERMIONE</b></font>)</div>said Hermione eagerly. <div class="bookquote">``Was it
one of the teachers?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``No,''  (<font color='red'><b>Harry/Potter/Harry Potter</b></font>)</div>said Harry. <div class="bookquote">``He (<font color='blue'><b>I</b></font>) wasn't a teacher.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``But it must have been a really powerful wizard, to drive all those
dementors away... If the Patronus was shining so brightly, didn't it
light him (<font color='blue'><b>wizard</b></font>) up? Couldn't you see --?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Yeah, I saw him (<font color='blue'><b>wizard</b></font>),''  (<font color='red'><b>Harry/Potter/Harry Potter</b></font>)</div>said Harry slowly. <div class="bookquote">``But... maybe I imagined it... I
wasn't thinking straight... I passed out right afterward...''

 (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Who did you think it was?''

 (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div><p/>I think --<div class="bookquote">'' Harry swallowed, knowing how strange this was going to
sound. I think it was my dad.''

 (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div><p/>Harry glanced up at Hermione and saw that her (<font color='blue'><b>Hermione</b></font>) mouth was fully open now.
She (<font color='blue'><b>Hermione</b></font>) was gazing at him (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) with a mixture of alarm and pity.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Harry, your dad's -- well -- dead,''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Hermione</b></font>) said quietly.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``I know that,''  (<font color='red'><b>Harry/Potter/Harry Potter</b></font>)</div>said Harry quickly.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``You think you saw his (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) ghost?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I don't know... no... he (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) looked solid...''

 (<font color='red'><b>Harry/Potter/Harry Potter</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``But then --''

 (<font color='red'><b>Harry/Potter/Harry Potter</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Maybe I was seeing things,''  (<font color='red'><b>Harry/Potter/Harry Potter</b></font>)</div>said Harry. <div class="bookquote">``But... from what I could
see... it looked like him (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>)... I've got photos of him (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>)...''

 (<font color='red'><b>Hermione/HERMIONE</b></font>)</div><p/>Hermione was still looking at him (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) as though worried about his (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) sanity.

<p/>I know it sounds crazy,'' said Harry flatly. He (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) turned to took at
Buckbeak, who was digging his (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) beak into the ground, apparently searching
for worms. But he (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) wasn't really watching Buckbeak.

<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) was thinking about his (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) father and about his (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) father's three oldest
friends... Moony, Wormtail, Padfoot, and Prongs... Had all four of them
been out on the grounds tonight? Wormtail had reappeared this evening
when everyone had thought he (<font color='blue'><b>Wormtail</b></font>) was dead... Was it so impossible his (<font color='blue'><b>Wormtail</b></font>)
father had done the same? Had he (<font color='blue'><b>Wormtail</b></font>) been seeing things across the take? The
figure had been too far away to see distinctly... yet he (<font color='blue'><b>Wormtail</b></font>) had felt sure,
for a moment, before he (<font color='blue'><b>Wormtail</b></font>)'d lost consciousness...

<p/>The leaves overhead rustled faintly in the breeze. The moon drifted in
and out of sight behind the shifting clouds. Hermione sat with her (<font color='blue'><b>Hermione</b></font>) face
turned toward the Willow, waiting.

<p/>And then, at last, after over an hour...

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Here we come!''  (<font color='red'><b>Hermione/HERMIONE</b></font>)</div>Hermione whispered.

<p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>Hermione</b></font>) and Harry got to their feet. Buckbeak raised his (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) head. They saw
Lupin, Ron, and Pettigrew clambering awkwardly out of the hole in the
roots. Then came Hermione... then the unconscious Snape, drifting
weirdly upward. Next came Harry and Black. They all began to walk toward
the castle.

<p/>Harry's heart was starting to beat very fast. He (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) glanced up at the sky.
Any moment now, that cloud was going to move aside and show the moon...

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Harry,''  (<font color='red'><b>Hermione/HERMIONE</b></font>)</div>Hermione muttered as though she (<font color='blue'><b>Hermione</b></font>) knew exactly what he (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) was
thinking, <div class="bookquote">``we've got to stay put. We mustn't be seen. There's nothing we
can do...''

 (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div><p/>``So we're just going to let Pettigrew escape all over again.. said Harry
quietly.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``How do you expect to find a rat in the dark?''  (<font color='red'><b>Hermione/HERMIONE</b></font>)</div>snapped Hermione.
<div class="bookquote">``There's nothing we can do! We came back to help Sirius; we're not
supposed to be doing anything else!''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``All right!''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/>The moon slid out from behind its cloud. They saw the tiny figures
across the grounds stop. Then they saw movement --

<p/><div class="bookquote">``There goes Lupin,''  (<font color='red'><b>Hermione/HERMIONE</b></font>)</div>Hermione whispered. ``He (<font color='blue'><b>Sirius</b></font>)'s transforming

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Hermione!''  (<font color='red'><b>Harry/Potter/Harry Potter</b></font>)</div>said Harry suddenly. <div class="bookquote">``We've got to move!''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``We mustn't, I keep telling you --''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Not to interfere! Lupin's going to run into the forest, right at us!''

 (<font color='red'><b>Hermione/HERMIONE</b></font>)</div><p/>Hermione gasped.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Quick!''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Hermione</b></font>) moaned, dashing to untie Buckbeak. <div class="bookquote">``Quick! Where are we
going to go? Where are we going to hide? The dementors wilt be coming
any moment --''

 (<font color='red'><b>Harry/Potter/Harry Potter</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Back to Hagrid's!''  (<font color='red'><b>Harry/Potter/Harry Potter</b></font>)</div>Harry said. <div class="bookquote">``It's empty now -- come on!''

 (<font color='red'><b>Buckbeak</b></font>)</div><p/>They ran as fast as they could, Buckbeak cantering along behind them.
They could hear the werewolf howling behind them...

<p/>The cabin was in sight; Harry skidded to the door, wrenched it open, and
Hermione and Buckbeak flashed past him (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>); Harry threw himself in after
them and bolted the door. Fang the boarhound barked loudly.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Shh, Fang, it's us!''  (<font color='red'><b>Hermione/HERMIONE</b></font>)</div>said Hermione, hurrying over and scratching his (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>)
ears to quieten him (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>). <div class="bookquote">``That was really close!''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Hermione</b></font>) said to Harry.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Yeah...''

 (<font color='red'><b>Harry/Potter/Harry Potter</b></font>)</div><p/>Harry was looking out of the window. It was much harder to see what was
going on from here. Buckbeak seemed very happy to find himself back
inside Hagrid's house. He (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) lay down in front of the fire, folded his (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>)
wings contentedly, and seemed ready for a good nap.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``I think I'd better go outside again, you know,''  (<font color='red'><b>Harry/Potter/Harry Potter</b></font>)</div>said Harry slowly. <div class="bookquote">``I
can't see what's going on -- we won't know when it's time --''

 (<font color='red'><b>Hermione/HERMIONE</b></font>)</div><p/>Hermione looked up. Her (<font color='blue'><b>Hermione</b></font>) expression was suspicious.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``I'm not going to try and interfere,''  (<font color='red'><b>Harry/Potter/Harry Potter</b></font>)</div>said Harry quickly. <div class="bookquote">``But if we
don't see what's going on, how're we going to know when it's time to
rescue Sirius?''

 (<font color='red'><b>Harry/Potter/Harry Potter</b></font>)</div><p/>``Well... okay, then... I'll wait here with Buckbeak... but Harry, be
careful -- there's a werewolf out there -- and the dementors

<p/>Harry stepped outside again and edged around the cabin. He (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) could hear
yelping in the distance. That meant the dementors were closing in on
Sirius... He (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) and Hermione would be running to him (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) any moment...

<p/>Harry stared out toward the lake, his (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) heart doing a kind of drumroll in
his (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) chest... Whoever had sent that Patronus would be appearing at any
moment...

<p/>For a fraction of a second he (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) stood, irresolute, in front of Hagrid's
door. You must not be seen. But he (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) didn't want to be seen. He (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) wanted to
do the seeing... He (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) had to know...

<p/>And there were the dementors. They were emerging out of the darkness
from every direction, gliding around the edges of the lake... They were
moving away from where Harry stood, to the opposite bank... He (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) wouldn't
have to get near them...

<p/>Harry began to run. He (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) had no thought in his (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) head except his (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) father...
If it was him (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>)... if it really was him (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>)... he (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) had to know, had to find
out...

<p/>The lake was coming nearer and nearer, but there was no sign of anybody.
On the opposite bank, he (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) could see tiny glimmers of silver -- his (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) own
attempts at a Patronus --

<p/>There was a bush at the very edge of the water. Harry threw himself
behind it, peering desperately through the leaves. On the opposite bank,
the glimmers of silver were suddenly extinguished. A terrified
excitement shot through him (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) -- any moment now --

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Come on!''  (<font color='red'><b>him</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) muttered, staring about. <div class="bookquote">``Where are you? Dad, come on --''

 (<font color='red'><b>Harry/Potter/Harry Potter</b></font>)</div><p/>But no one came. Harry raised his (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) head to look at the circle of
dementors across the lake. One of them was lowering its hood. It was
time for the rescuer to appear -- but no one was coming to help this
time --

<p/>And then it hit him (<font color='blue'><b>rescuer</b></font>) -- he (<font color='blue'><b>rescuer</b></font>) understood. He (<font color='blue'><b>rescuer</b></font>) hadn't seen his (<font color='blue'><b>rescuer</b></font>) father -- he (<font color='blue'><b>rescuer</b></font>)
had seen himself --

<p/>Harry flung himself out from behind the bush and pulled out his (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) wand.

<p/>``EXPECTO PATRONUM! ``he (<font color='blue'><b>Dad</b></font>) yelled.

<p/>And out of the end of his (<font color='blue'><b>Dad</b></font>) wand burst, not a shapeless cloud of mist, but
a blinding, dazzling, silver animal. He (<font color='blue'><b>Dad</b></font>) screwed up his (<font color='blue'><b>Dad</b></font>) eyes, trying to
see what it was. It looked like a horse. It was galloping silently away
from him (<font color='blue'><b>Dad</b></font>), across the black surface of the lake. He (<font color='blue'><b>Dad</b></font>) saw it lower its head
and charge at the swarming dementors... Now it was galloping around and
around the black shapes on the ground, and the dementors were falling
back, scattering, retreating into the darkness... They were gone.

<p/>The Patronus turned. It was cantering back toward Harry across the still
surface of the water. It wasn't a horse. It wasn't a unicorn, either. It
was a stag. It was shining brightly as the moon above ... it was coming
back to him (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>)...

<p/>It stopped on the bank. Its hooves made no mark on the soft ground as it
stared at Harry with its large, silver eyes. Slowly, it bowed its
antlered head. And Harry realized... ``Prongs, ``he (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) whispered.

<p/>But as his (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) trembling fingertips stretched toward the creature, it
vanished.

<p/>Harry stood there, hand still outstretched. Then, with a great leap of
his (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) heart, he (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) heard hooves behind him (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) -he (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) whirled around and saw
Hermione dashing toward him (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>), dragging Buckbeak behind her (<font color='blue'><b>Hermione</b></font>).

<p/><div class="bookquote">``What did you do?''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Hermione</b></font>) said fiercely. <div class="bookquote">``You said you were only going to
keep a lookout!''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I just saved all our lives...,''  (<font color='red'><b>Harry/Potter/Harry Potter</b></font>)</div>said Harry. <div class="bookquote">``Get behind here -- behind
this bush -- I'll explain.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Hermione/HERMIONE</b></font>)</div><p/>Hermione listened to what had just happened with her (<font color='blue'><b>Hermione</b></font>) mouth open yet
again.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Did anyone see you?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Yes, haven't you been listening? I saw me but I thought I was my dad!
It's okay!''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Harry, I can't believe it... You conjured up a Patronus that drove
away all those dementors! That's very, very advanced magic. I knew I
could do it this time,''  (<font color='red'><b>Harry/Potter/Harry Potter</b></font>)</div>said Harry, <div class="bookquote">``because I'd already done it...
Does that make sense?''

 (<font color='red'><b>Harry/Potter/Harry Potter</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I don't know -- Harry, look at Snape!''

 (<font color='red'><b>bush</b></font>)</div><p/>Together they peered around the bush at the other bank. Snape had
regained consciousness. He (<font color='blue'><b>Snape</b></font>) was conjuring stretchers and lifting the limp
forms of Harry, Hermione, and Black onto them. A fourth stretcher, no
doubt bearing Ron, was already floating at his (<font color='blue'><b>Ron</b></font>) side. Then, wand held out
in front of him (<font color='blue'><b>Ron</b></font>), he (<font color='blue'><b>Ron</b></font>) moved them away toward the castle.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Right, it's nearly time,''  (<font color='red'><b>Hermione/HERMIONE</b></font>)</div>said Hermione tensely, looking at her (<font color='blue'><b>Hermione</b></font>) watch.
``We've got about forty-five minutes until Dumbledore locks the door to
the hospital wing. We've got to rescue Sirius and get back into the ward
before anybody realizes we're missing... 11

<p/>They waited, watching the moving clouds reflected in the lake, while the
bush next to them whispered in the breeze. Buckbeak, bored, was
ferreting for worms again.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``D' you reckon he (<font color='blue'><b>Sirius</b></font>)'s up there yet?''  (<font color='red'><b>Harry/Potter/Harry Potter</b></font>)</div>said Harry, checking his (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) watch. He (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>)
looked up at the castle and began counting the windows to the right of
the West Tower.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Look!''  (<font color='red'><b>Hermione/HERMIONE</b></font>)</div>Hermione whispered. <div class="bookquote">''\Who's that? Someone's coming back out of
the castle!''

 (<font color='red'><b>Hermione/HERMIONE</b></font>)</div><p/>Harry stared through the darkness. The man was hurrying across the
grounds, toward one of the entrances. Something shiny glinted in his (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>)
belt.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Macnair!''  (<font color='red'><b>Harry/Potter/Harry Potter</b></font>)</div>said Harry. <div class="bookquote">``The executioner! He (<font color='blue'><b>executioner</b></font>)'s gone to get the dementors!
This is it, Hermione --''

 (<font color='red'><b>Hermione/HERMIONE</b></font>)</div><p/>Hermione put her (<font color='blue'><b>Hermione</b></font>) hands on Buckbeak's back and Harry gave her (<font color='blue'><b>Hermione</b></font>) a leg up.
Then he (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) placed his (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) foot on one of the lower branches of the bush and
climbed up in front of her (<font color='blue'><b>Hermione</b></font>). He (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) pulled Buckbeak's rope back over his (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) neck
and tied it to the other side of his (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) collar like reins.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Ready?''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) whispered to Hermione. ``YotM better hold on to me --

<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>executioner</b></font>) nudged Buckbeak's sides with his (<font color='blue'><b>executioner</b></font>) heels.

<p/>Buckbeak soared straight into the dark air. Harry gripped his (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) flanks
with his (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) knees, feeling the great wings rising powerfully beneath them.
Hermione was holding Harry very tight around the waist; he (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) could hear
her (<font color='blue'><b>Hermione</b></font>) muttering, <div class="bookquote">``Oh, no -- I don't like this oh, I really don't like this
--''

 (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div><p/>Harry urged Buckbeak forward. They were gliding quietly toward the upper
floors of the castle... Harry pulled hard on the left-hand side of the
rope, and Buckbeak turned. Harry was trying to count the windows
flashing past --

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Whoa!''  (<font color='red'><b>Harry/Potter/Harry Potter</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) said, pulling backward as hard as he (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) could.

<p/>Buckbeak slowed down and they found themselves at a stop, unless you
counted the fact that they kept rising up and down several feet as the
hippogriff beat his (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) wings to remain airborne.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``He (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>)'s there!''  (<font color='red'><b>Harry/Potter/Harry Potter</b></font>)</div>Harry said, spotting Sirius as they rose up beside the
window. He (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) reached out, and as Buckbeak's wings fell, was able to tap
sharply on the glass.

<p/>Black looked up. Harry saw his (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) jaw drop. He (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) leapt from his (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) chair,
hurried to the window and tried to open it, but it was locked.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Stand back!''  (<font color='red'><b>Hermione/HERMIONE</b></font>)</div>Hermione called to him (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>), and she (<font color='blue'><b>Hermione</b></font>) took out her (<font color='blue'><b>Hermione</b></font>) wand, still
gripping the back of Harry's robes with her (<font color='blue'><b>Hermione</b></font>) left hand.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Alohomora!''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/>The window sprang open.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``How -- how --?''  (<font color='red'><b>Black/Sirius/Sirius Black</b></font>)</div>said Black weakly, staring at the hippogriff

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Get on -- there's not much time,''  (<font color='red'><b>Black/Sirius/Sirius Black</b></font>)</div>said Harry, gripping Buckbeak firmly
on either side of his (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) sleek neck to hold him (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) steady. <div class="bookquote">``You've got to get
out of here -the dementors are coming -- Macnair's gone to get them.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/>Black placed a hand on either side of the window frame and heaved his (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>)
head and shoulders out of it. It was very lucky he (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) was so thin. In
seconds, he (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) had managed to fling one leg over Buckbeak's back and pull
himself onto the hippogriff behind Hermione.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Okay, Buckbeak, up!''  (<font color='red'><b>Harry/Potter/Harry Potter</b></font>)</div>said Harry, shaking the rope. ``Up to the tower --
come on.

<p/>The hippogriff gave one sweep of its mighty wings and they were soaring
upward again, high as the top of the West Tower. Buckbeak landed with a
clatter on the battlements, and Harry and Hermione slid off him (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) at once.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Sirius, you'd better go, quick,''  (<font color='red'><b>Harry/Potter/Harry Potter</b></font>)</div>Harry panted. <div class="bookquote">``They'll reach
Flitwick's office any moment, they'll find out you're gone.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Buckbeak</b></font>)</div><p/>Buckbeak pawed the ground, tossing his (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) sharp head.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``What happened to the other boy? Ron?''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>croaked Sirius.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``He (<font color='blue'><b>Ron</b></font>)'s going to be okay. He (<font color='blue'><b>Ron</b></font>)'s still out of it, but Madam Pomfrey says
she (<font color='blue'><b>Pomfrey</b></font>)'ll be able to make him (<font color='blue'><b>Ron</b></font>) better. Quick -- go --''

 (<font color='red'><b>Black/Sirius/Sirius Black</b></font>)</div><p/>But Black was still staring down at Harry.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``How can I ever thank --''

 (<font color='red'><b>Harry/Potter/Harry Potter</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``GO!''  (<font color='red'><b>Harry/Potter/Harry Potter</b></font>)</div>Harry and Hermione shouted together.

<p/>Black wheeled Buckbeak around, facing the open sky.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``We'll see each other again,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) said. <div class="bookquote">``You are -- truly your father's
son, Harry...''

 (<font color='red'><b>He</b></font>)</div><p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) squeezed Buckbeak's sides with his (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) heels. Harry and Hermione jumped
back as the enormous wings rose once more... The hippogriff took off
into the air... He (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) and his (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) rider became smaller and smaller as Harry
gazed after them... then a cloud drifted across the moon... They were
gone.

<p/>CHAPTER TWENTY-TWO

<p/>OWL POST AGAIN

<p/>Harry!''

<p/>Hermione was tugging at his (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) sleeve, staring at her (<font color='blue'><b>Hermione</b></font>) watch. <div class="bookquote">``We've got
exactly ten minutes to get back down to the hospital wing without
anybody seeing us -- before Dumbledore locks the door --''

 (<font color='red'><b>Harry/Potter/Harry Potter</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Okay,''  (<font color='red'><b>Harry/Potter/Harry Potter</b></font>)</div>said Harry, wrenching his (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) gaze from the sky, <div class="bookquote">``let's go...''

 (<font color='red'><b>Harry/Potter/Harry Potter</b></font>)</div><p/>They slipped through the doorway behind them and down a tightly
spiraling stone staircase. As they reached the bottom of it, they heard
voices. They flattened themselves against the wall and listened. It
sounded like Fudge and Snape. They were walking quickly along the
corridor at the foot of the staircase.

<p/><div class="bookquote">''... only hope Dumbledore's not going to make difficulties,''  (<font color='red'><b>Snape/Severus/Severus Snape</b></font>)</div>Snape was
saying. <div class="bookquote">``The Kiss will be performed immediately?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``As soon as Macnair returns with the dementors. This whole Black affair
has been highly embarrassing. I can't tell you how much I'm looking
forward to informing the Daily Prophet that we've got him (<font color='blue'><b>Prophet</b></font>) at last... I
daresay they'll want to interview you, Snape... and once young Harry's
back in his (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) right mind, I expect he (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>)'ll want to tell the Prophet exactly
how you saved him (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>)...''

 (<font color='red'><b>Harry/Potter/Harry Potter</b></font>)</div><p/>Harry clenched his (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) teeth. He (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) caught a glimpse of Snape's smirk as he (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) and
Fudge passed Harry and Hermione's hiding place. Their footsteps died
away. Harry and Hermione waited a few moments to make sure they'd really
gone, then started to run in the opposite direction. Down one staircase,
then another, along a new ,corridor -- then they heard a cackling ahead.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Peeves!''  (<font color='red'><b>Harry/Potter/Harry Potter</b></font>)</div>Harry muttered, grabbing Hermione's wrist. <div class="bookquote">``In here!''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/>They tore into a deserted classroom to their left just in time. Peeves
seemed to be bouncing along the corridor in boisterous good spirits,
laughing his (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) head off.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Oh, he (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>)'s horrible,''  (<font color='red'><b>Hermione/HERMIONE</b></font>)</div>whispered Hermione, her (<font color='blue'><b>Hermione</b></font>) ear to the door. <div class="bookquote">``I bet
he (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>)'s all excited because the dementors are going to finish off
Sirius...''  (<font color='red'><b>She</b></font>)</div>She (<font color='blue'><b>Hermione</b></font>) checked her (<font color='blue'><b>Hermione</b></font>) watch. <div class="bookquote">``Three minutes, Harry!''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/>They waited until Peeves's gloating voice had faded into the distance,
then slid back out of the room and broke into a run again.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Hermione -- what'll happen -- if we don't get back inside before
Dumbledore locks the door?''  (<font color='red'><b>Harry/Potter/Harry Potter</b></font>)</div>Harry panted.

<p/>I don't want to think about it!'' Hermione moaned, checking her (<font color='blue'><b>Hermione</b></font>) watch
again. <div class="bookquote">``One minute!''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/>They had reached the end of the corridor with the hospital wing
entrance. <div class="bookquote">``Okay -- I can hear Dumbledore,''  (<font color='red'><b>Hermione/HERMIONE</b></font>)</div>said Hermione tensely. <div class="bookquote">``Come
on, Harry!''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/>They crept along the corridor. The door opened. Dumbledore's back
appeared.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``I am going to lock you in,''  (<font color='red'><b>him</b></font>)</div>they heard him (<font color='blue'><b>Dumbledore</b></font>) saying. <div class="bookquote">``it is five minutes
to midnight. Miss Granger, three turns should do It. Good luck.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Dumbledore/Albus Dumbledore</b></font>)</div><p/>Dumbledore backed out of the room, closed the door, and took out his (<font color='blue'><b>Dumbledore</b></font>)
wand to magically lock it. Panicking, Harry and Hermione ran forward.
Dumbledore looked up, and a wide smile appeared under the long silver
mustache. <div class="bookquote">``Well?''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) said quietly.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``We did it!''  (<font color='red'><b>Harry/Potter/Harry Potter</b></font>)</div>said Harry breathlessly. <div class="bookquote">``Sirius has gone, on Buckbeak...''

 (<font color='red'><b>Dumbledore/Albus Dumbledore</b></font>)</div><p/>Dumbledore beamed at them.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Well done. I think --''  (<font color='red'><b>He</b></font>)</div>He (<font color='blue'><b>Dumbledore</b></font>) listened intently for any sound within the
hospital wing. <div class="bookquote">``Yes, I think you've gone too -- get inside -- I'll lock
you in --''

 (<font color='red'><b>Harry/Potter/Harry Potter</b></font>)</div><p/>Harry and Hermione slipped back inside the dormitory. It was empty
except for Ron, who was still lying motionless in the end bed. As the
lock clicked behind them, Harry and Hermione crept back to their own
beds, Hermione tucking the Time-Turner back under her (<font color='blue'><b>Hermione</b></font>) robes. A moment
later, Madam Pomfrey came striding back out of her (<font color='blue'><b>Pomfrey</b></font>) office.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Did I hear the headmaster leaving? Am I allowed to look after my
patients now?''

 (<font color='red'><b>She</b></font>)</div><p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>Pomfrey</b></font>) was in a very bad mood. Harry and Hermione thought it best to accept
their chocolate quietly. Madam Pomfrey stood over them, making sure they
ate it. But Harry could hardly swallow. He (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) and Hermione were waiting,
listening, their nerves jangling... And then, as they both took a
fourth piece of chocolate from Madam Pomfrey, they heard a distant roar
of fury echoing from somewhere above them...

<p/><div class="bookquote">``What was that?''  (<font color='red'><b>Hermione/HERMIONE</b></font>)</div>said Madam Pomfrey in alarm.

<p/>Now they could hear angry voices, growing louder and louder. Madam
Pomfrey was staring at the door.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Really -- they'll wake everybody up! What do they think they're doing?''

 (<font color='red'><b>Harry/Potter/Harry Potter</b></font>)</div><p/>Harry was trying to hear what the voices were saying. They were drawing
nearer --

<p/><div class="bookquote">``He (<font color='blue'><b>headmaster</b></font>) must have Disapparated, Severus. We should have left somebody in the
room with him (<font color='blue'><b>headmaster</b></font>). When this gets out --''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/>``HE (<font color='blue'><b>headmaster</b></font>) DIDN``T DISAPPARATE!'' Snape roared, now very close at hand. ``YOU
CAN<div class="bookquote">``T APPARATE OR DISAPPARATE INSIDE THIS CASTLE! THIS -- HAS --
SOMETHING -- TO -- DO -- WITH -- POTTER!''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Severus -- be reasonable -- Harry has been locked up --''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/>BAM.

<p/>The door of the hospital wing burst open.

<p/>Fudge, Snape, and Dumbledore came striding into the ward. Dumbledore
alone looked calm. Indeed, he (<font color='blue'><b>Dumbledore</b></font>) looked as though he (<font color='blue'><b>Dumbledore</b></font>) was quite enjoying
himself. Fudge appeared angry. But Snape was beside himself.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``OUT WITH IT, POTTER!''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Snape</b></font>) bellowed. <div class="bookquote">``WHAT DID YOU DO?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Professor Snape!''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>shrieked Madam Pomfrey. <div class="bookquote">``Control yourself!''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``See here, Snape, be reasonable,''  (<font color='red'><b>Fudge</b></font>)</div>said Fudge. <div class="bookquote">``This door's been locked,
we just saw --''

 (<font color='red'><b>Snape/Severus/Severus Snape</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``THEY HELPED HIM ESCAPE, I KNOW IT!''  (<font color='red'><b>Snape/Severus/Severus Snape</b></font>)</div>Snape howled, pointing at Harry and
Hermione. His (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) face was twisted; spit was flying from his (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) mouth.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Calm down, man!''  (<font color='red'><b>Fudge</b></font>)</div>Fudge barked. <div class="bookquote">``You're talking nonsense!''

 (<font color='red'><b>Harry/Potter/Harry Potter</b></font>)</div><p/>``YOU DON``T KNOW POTTER!'' shrieked Snape. <div class="bookquote">``HE (<font color='blue'><b>POTTER</b></font>) DID IT, I KNOW HE (<font color='blue'><b>POTTER</b></font>) DID IT
--''

 (<font color='red'><b>Dumbledore/Albus Dumbledore</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``That will do, Severus,''  (<font color='red'><b>HE</b></font>)</div>said Dumbledore quietly. <div class="bookquote">``Think about what you
are saying. This door has been locked since I left the ward ten minutes
ago. Madam Pomfrey, have these students left their beds?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Of course not!''  (<font color='red'><b>Madam Pomfrey</b></font>)</div>said Madam Pomfrey, bristling. <div class="bookquote">``I would have heard
them!''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Well, there you have it, Severus,''  (<font color='red'><b>Dumbledore/Albus Dumbledore</b></font>)</div>said Dumbledore calmly. <div class="bookquote">``Unless you
are suggesting that Harry and Hermione are able to be in two places at
once, I'm afraid I don't see any point in troubling them further.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Snape/Severus/Severus Snape</b></font>)</div><p/>Snape stood there, seething, staring from Fudge, who looked thoroughly
shocked at his (<font color='blue'><b>Snape</b></font>) behavior, to Dumbledore, whose eyes were twinkling behind
his (<font color='blue'><b>Dumbledore</b></font>) glasses. Snape whirled about, robes swishing behind him (<font color='blue'><b>Snape</b></font>), and stormed
out of the ward.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Fellow seems quite unbalanced,''  (<font color='red'><b>Fudge</b></font>)</div>said Fudge, staring after him (<font color='blue'><b>Snape</b></font>). <div class="bookquote">``I'd
watch out for him (<font color='blue'><b>Fellow</b></font>) if I were you, Dumbledore.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Oh, he (<font color='blue'><b>Dumbledore</b></font>)'s not unbalanced,''  (<font color='red'><b>Dumbledore/Albus Dumbledore</b></font>)</div>said Dumbledore quietly. <div class="bookquote">``He (<font color='blue'><b>Dumbledore</b></font>)'s just suffered
a severe disappointment.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``He (<font color='blue'><b>Dumbledore</b></font>)'s not the only one!''  (<font color='red'><b>Fudge</b></font>)</div>puffed Fudge. ``The Daily Prophet's going to
have a field day! We had Black cornered and he (<font color='blue'><b>Black</b></font>) slipped through our
fingers yet again! All it needs now is for the story of that
hippogriff's escape to get out, and I'll be a laughingstock! Well... I'd
better go and notify the Ministry...

<p/><div class="bookquote">``And the dementors?''  (<font color='red'><b>Dumbledore/Albus Dumbledore</b></font>)</div>said Dumbledore. <div class="bookquote">``They'll be removed from the
school, I trust?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Oh yes, they'll have to go,''  (<font color='red'><b>Fudge</b></font>)</div>said Fudge, running his (<font color='blue'><b>Dumbledore</b></font>) fingers

<p/>distractedly through his (<font color='blue'><b>Dumbledore</b></font>) hair. <div class="bookquote">``Never dreamed they'd attempt to
administer the Kiss on an innocent boy... Completely out of control...
no, I'll have them packed off back to Azkaban tonight... Perhaps we
should think about dragons at the school entrance...''

 (<font color='red'><b>Dumbledore/Albus Dumbledore</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Hagrid would like that,''  (<font color='red'><b>Dumbledore/Albus Dumbledore</b></font>)</div>said Dumbledore, smiling at Harry and
Hermione. As he (<font color='blue'><b>Dumbledore</b></font>) and Fudge left the dormitory, Madam Pomfrey hurried to
the door and locked it again. Muttering angrily to herself, she (<font color='blue'><b>Pomfrey</b></font>) headed
back to her (<font color='blue'><b>Pomfrey</b></font>) office.

<p/>There was a low moan from the other end of the ward. Ron had woken up.
They could see him (<font color='blue'><b>Ron</b></font>) sitting up, rubbing his (<font color='blue'><b>Ron</b></font>) head, looking around.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``What -- what happened?''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Ron</b></font>) groaned. <div class="bookquote">``Harry? Why are we in here? Where's
Sirius? Where's Lupin? What's going on?''

 (<font color='red'><b>Harry/Potter/Harry Potter</b></font>)</div><p/>Harry and Hermione looked at each other.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``You explain,''  (<font color='red'><b>Harry/Potter/Harry Potter</b></font>)</div>said Harry, helping himself to some more chocolate.

<p/>When Harry, Ron, and Hermione left the hospital wing at noon the next
day, it was to find an almost deserted castle. The sweltering, heat and
the end of the exams meant that everyone was taking full advantage of
another Hogsmeade visit. Neither Ron nor Hermione felt like going,
however, so they and Harry wandered onto the grounds, still talking
about the extraordinary events of the previous night and wondering where
Sirius and Buckbeak were now. Sitting near the lake, watching the giant
squid waving its tentacles lazily above the water, Harry lost the thread
of the conversation as he (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) looked across to the opposite bank. The stag
had galloped toward him (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) from there just last night...

<p/>A shadow fell across them and they looked `tip to see a very bleary-eyed
Hagrid, mopping his (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) sweaty face with one of his (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) tablecloth-sized
handkerchiefs and beaming down at them.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Know I shouldn' feel happy, after wha' happened las' night,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) said.
<div class="bookquote">``I mean, Black escapin' again, an, everythin' -- but guess what?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``What?''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>they said, pretending to look curious.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Beaky! He (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) escaped! He (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>)'s free! Bin celebratin' all night!''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``That's wonderful!''  (<font color='red'><b>Hermione/HERMIONE</b></font>)</div>said Hermione, giving Ron a reproving look because
he (<font color='blue'><b>Ron</b></font>) looked as though he (<font color='blue'><b>Ron</b></font>) was close to laughing.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Yeah... can't've tied him (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) up properly,''  (<font color='red'><b>Hagrid</b></font>)</div>said Hagrid, gazing happily out
over the grounds. <div class="bookquote">``I was worried this mornin', mind... thought he (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) mighta
met Professor Lupin on the grounds, but Lupin says he (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) never ate anythin'
las' night...''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``What?''  (<font color='red'><b>Harry/Potter/Harry Potter</b></font>)</div>said Harry quickly.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Blimey, haven' yeh heard?''  (<font color='red'><b>Hagrid</b></font>)</div>said Hagrid, his (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) smile fading a little. He (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>)
lowered his (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) voice, even though there was nobody in sight. ``Er -- Snape
told all the Slytherins this mornin'... Thought everyone'd know by
now... Professor Lupin's a werewolf, see. An' he (<font color='blue'><b>Professor</b></font>) was loose on the
grounds las' night... He (<font color='blue'><b>Professor</b></font>)'s packin' now, o' course.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``He (<font color='blue'><b>Professor</b></font>)'s packing?''  (<font color='red'><b>Harry/Potter/Harry Potter</b></font>)</div>said Harry, alarmed. <div class="bookquote">``Why?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Leavin', isn' he (<font color='blue'><b>Professor</b></font>)?''  (<font color='red'><b>Hagrid</b></font>)</div>said Hagrid, looking surprised that Harry had to
ask. ``Resigned firs' thing this mornin'. Says he (<font color='blue'><b>Professor</b></font>) can't risk it happenin
again.

<p/>Harry scrambled to his (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) feet.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``I'm going to see him (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>),''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) said to Ron and Hermione.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``But if he (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>)'s resigned --''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">''-- doesn't sound like there's anything we can do --''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I don't care. I still want to see him (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>). I'll meet you back here.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Lupin/R. J. Lupin</b></font>)</div><p/>Lupin's office door was open. He (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) had already packed most of his (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) things.
The grindylow's empty tank stood next to his (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) battered old suitcase,
which was open and nearly full. Lupin was bending over something on his (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>)
desk and looked up only when Harry knocked on the door.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``I saw you coming,''  (<font color='red'><b>Lupin/R. J. Lupin</b></font>)</div>said Lupin, smiling. He (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) pointed to the parchment he (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>)
had been poring over. It was the Marauder's Map.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``I just saw Hagrid,''  (<font color='red'><b>Harry/Potter/Harry Potter</b></font>)</div>said Harry. <div class="bookquote">``And he (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) said you'd resigned. It's not
true, is it?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I'm afraid it is,''  (<font color='red'><b>Lupin/R. J. Lupin</b></font>)</div>said Lupin. He (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) started opening his (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) desk drawers and
taking out the contents.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Why?''  (<font color='red'><b>Harry/Potter/Harry Potter</b></font>)</div>said Harry. <div class="bookquote">``The Ministry of Magic don't think you were helping
Sirius, do they?''

 (<font color='red'><b>Lupin/R. J. Lupin</b></font>)</div><p/>Lupin crossed to the door and closed it behind Harry.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``No. Professor Dumbledore managed to convince Fudge that I was trying to
save your lives.''  (<font color='red'><b>He</b></font>)</div>He (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) sighed. <div class="bookquote">``That was the final straw for Severus. I
think the loss of the Order of Merlin hit him (<font color='blue'><b>Merlin</b></font>) hard. So he (<font color='blue'><b>Merlin</b></font>) -- er --
accidentally let slip that I am a werewolf this morning at breakfast.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``You're not leaving just because of that!''  (<font color='red'><b>Harry/Potter/Harry Potter</b></font>)</div>said Harry.

<p/>Lupin smiled wryly.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``This time tomorrow, the owls will start arriving from parents... They
will not want a werewolf teaching their children, Harry. And after last
night, I see their point. I could have bitten any of you... That must
never happen again.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``You're the best Defense Against the Dark Arts- teacher we've ever had!''
 (<font color='red'><b>Harry/Potter/Harry Potter</b></font>)</div>said Harry. <div class="bookquote">``Don't go!''

 (<font color='red'><b>Lupin/R. J. Lupin</b></font>)</div><p/>Lupin shook his (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) head and didn't speak. He (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) carried on emptying his (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>)
drawers. Then, while Harry was trying to think of a good argument to
make him (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) stay, Lupin said, <div class="bookquote">``From what the headmaster told me this
morning, you saved a lot of lives last night, Harry. if I'm proud of
anything I've done this year, it's how much you've learned... Tell me
about your Patronus.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Lupin/R. J. Lupin</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``How d'you know about that?''  (<font color='red'><b>Harry/Potter/Harry Potter</b></font>)</div>said Harry, distracted.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``What else could have driven the dementors back?''

 (<font color='red'><b>Harry/Potter/Harry Potter</b></font>)</div><p/>Harry told Lupin what had happened. When he (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>)'d finished, Lupin was
smiling again.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Yes, your father was always a stag when he (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) transformed,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) said. <div class="bookquote">``You
guessed right... that's why we called him (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) Prongs.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Lupin/R. J. Lupin</b></font>)</div><p/>Lupin threw his (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) last few books into his (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) case, closed the desk drawers,
and turned to look at Harry.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Here -- I brought this from the Shrieking Shack last night,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) said,
handing Harry back the Invisibility Cloak. <div class="bookquote">``And...''  (<font color='red'><b>He</b></font>)</div>He (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) hesitated, then
held out the Marauder's Map too. <div class="bookquote">``I am no longer your teacher, so I
don't feel guilty about giving you back this as well. It's no use to me,
and I daresay you, Ron, and Hermione will find uses for it.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Harry/Potter/Harry Potter</b></font>)</div><p/>Harry took the map and grinned.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``You told me Moony, Wormtail, Padfoot, and Prongs would've wanted to
lure me out of school... you said they'd have thought it was funny.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``And so we would have,''  (<font color='red'><b>Lupin/R. J. Lupin</b></font>)</div>said Lupin, now reaching down to close his (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) case.
<div class="bookquote">``I have no hesitation in saying that James would have been highly
disappointed if his (<font color='blue'><b>James</b></font>) son had never found any of the secret passages out
of the castle.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/>There was a knock on the door. Harry hastily stuffed the Marauder's Map
and the Invisibility Cloak into his (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) pocket.

<p/>It was Professor Dumbledore. He (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) didn't look surprised to see Harry
there.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Your carriage is at the gates, Remus,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) said.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Thank You, Headmaster.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Lupin/R. J. Lupin</b></font>)</div><p/>Lupin picked up his (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) old suitcase and the empty grindylow tank.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Well -- good-bye, Harry,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) said, smiling. <div class="bookquote">``It has been a real
pleasure teaching you. I feel sure we'll meet again sometime.
Headmaster, there is no need to see me to the gates, I can manage...''

 (<font color='red'><b>Harry/Potter/Harry Potter</b></font>)</div><p/>Harry had the impression that Lupin wanted to leave as quickly as
possible.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Good-bye, then, Remus,''  (<font color='red'><b>Dumbledore/Albus Dumbledore</b></font>)</div>said Dumbledore soberly. Lupin shifted the
grindylow tank slightly so that he (<font color='blue'><b>Dumbledore</b></font>) and Dumbledore could shake hands.
Then, with a final nod to Harry and a swift smile, Lupin left the
office.

<p/>Harry sat down in his (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) vacated chair, staring glumly at the floor. He (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>)
heard the door close and looked up. Dumbledore was still there.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Why so miserable, Harry?''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Dumbledore</b></font>) said quietly. <div class="bookquote">``You should be very proud of
yourself after last night.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``It didn't make any difference,''  (<font color='red'><b>Harry/Potter/Harry Potter</b></font>)</div>said Harry bitterly. <div class="bookquote">``Pettigrew got
away.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Didn't make any difference?''  (<font color='red'><b>Dumbledore/Albus Dumbledore</b></font>)</div>said Dumbledore quietly, <div class="bookquote">``It made all the
difference in the world, Harry. You helped uncover the truth. You saved
an innocent man from a terrible fate.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Dumbledore/Albus Dumbledore</b></font>)</div><p/>Terrible. Something stirred in Harry's memory. Greater and more terrible
than ever before... Professor Trelawney's prediction!

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Professor Dumbledore -- yesterday, when I was having my Divination
exam, Professor Trelawney went very -- very strange.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Indeed?''  (<font color='red'><b>Dumbledore/Albus Dumbledore</b></font>)</div>said Dumbledore. <div class="bookquote">``Er -- stranger than usual, you mean?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Yes... her (<font color='blue'><b>yourself</b></font>) voice went all deep and her (<font color='blue'><b>yourself</b></font>) eyes rolled and she (<font color='blue'><b>yourself</b></font>) said ... she (<font color='blue'><b>yourself</b></font>)
said Voldemort's servant was going to set out to return to him (<font color='blue'><b>servant</b></font>) before
midnight... She (<font color='blue'><b>yourself</b></font>) said the servant would help him (<font color='blue'><b>servant</b></font>) come back to power.''
 (<font color='red'><b>Harry/Potter/Harry Potter</b></font>)</div>Harry stared up at Dumbledore. <div class="bookquote">``And then she (<font color='blue'><b>yourself</b></font>) sort of became normal
again, and she (<font color='blue'><b>yourself</b></font>) couldn't remember anything she (<font color='blue'><b>yourself</b></font>)'d said. Was it -- was she (<font color='blue'><b>yourself</b></font>)
making a real prediction?''

 (<font color='red'><b>Dumbledore/Albus Dumbledore</b></font>)</div><p/>Dumbledore looked mildly impressed.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Do you know, Harry, I think she (<font color='blue'><b>yourself</b></font>) might have been.''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) said thoughtfully.
<div class="bookquote">``Who'd have thought it? That brings her (<font color='blue'><b>yourself</b></font>) total of real predictions up to
two. I should offer her (<font color='blue'><b>yourself</b></font>) a pay raise...''

 (<font color='red'><b>Harry/Potter/Harry Potter</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``But --''  (<font color='red'><b>Harry/Potter/Harry Potter</b></font>)</div>Harry looked at him (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>), aghast. How could Dumbledore take this so
calmly?

<p/><div class="bookquote">``But -- I stopped Sirius and Professor Lupin from killing Pettigrew!
That makes it my fault if Voldemort comes back!''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``It does not,''  (<font color='red'><b>Dumbledore/Albus Dumbledore</b></font>)</div>said Dumbledore quietly. <div class="bookquote">``Hasn't your experience with the
Time-Turner taught you anything, Harry? The consequences of our actions
are always so complicated, so diverse, that predicting the future is a
very difficult business indeed... Professor Trelawney, bless her (<font color='blue'><b>yourself</b></font>), is
living proof of that... You did a very noble thing, in saving
Pettigrew's life.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/>``But if he (<font color='blue'><b>Pettigrew</b></font>) helps Voldemort back to power

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Pettigrew owes his (<font color='blue'><b>Pettigrew</b></font>) life to you. You have sent Voldemort a deputy who is
in your debt... When one wizard saves another wizard's life, it creates
a certain bond between them... and I'm much mistaken if Voldemort wants
his (<font color='blue'><b>Voldemort</b></font>) servant in the debt of Harry Potter.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I don't want a connection with Pettigrew!''  (<font color='red'><b>Harry/Potter/Harry Potter</b></font>)</div>said Harry. <div class="bookquote">``He (<font color='blue'><b>Pettigrew</b></font>) betrayed my
parents!''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``This is magic at its deepest, its most impenetrable, Harry. But trust
me... the time may come when you will be very glad you saved Pettigrew's
life.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Harry/Potter/Harry Potter</b></font>)</div><p/>Harry couldn't imagine when that would be. Dumbledore looked as though
he (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) knew what Harry was thinking.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``I knew your father very well, both at Hogwarts and later, Harry,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>)
said gently. <div class="bookquote">``He (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) would have saved Pettigrew too, I am sure of it.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Harry/Potter/Harry Potter</b></font>)</div><p/>Harry looked up at him (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>). Dumbledore wouldn't laugh -- he (<font color='blue'><b>Dumbledore</b></font>) could tell
Dumbledore...

<p/><div class="bookquote">``I thought it was my dad who'd conjured my Patronus. I mean, when I saw
myself across the lake ... I thought I was seeing him (<font color='blue'><b>dad</b></font>).''  (<font color='red'><b>Dumbledore/Albus Dumbledore</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``An easy mistake
to make,''  (<font color='red'><b>Dumbledore/Albus Dumbledore</b></font>)</div>said Dumbledore softly. ``I expect you'll tire of hearing it,
but you do look extraordinarily like James. Except for the eyes... you
have your mother's eyes.

<p/>Harry shook his (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) head.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``It was stupid, thinking it was him (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>),''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Dumbledore</b></font>) muttered. <div class="bookquote">``I mean, I knew he (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>)
was dead.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``You think the dead we loved ever truly leave us? You think that we
don't recall them more clearly than ever in times of great trouble? Your
father is alive in you, Harry, and shows himself most plainly when you
have need of him (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>). How else could you produce that particular Patronus?
Prongs rode again last night.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Harry/Potter/Harry Potter</b></font>)</div><p/>It took a moment for Harry to realize what Dumblefore had said.

<p/>Last night Sirius told me all about how they became Animagi,'' said
Dumbledore, smiling. <div class="bookquote">``An extraordinary achievement -- not least, keeping
it quiet from me. And then I remembered the most unusual form your
Patronus took, when it charged Mr. Malfoy down at your Quidditch match
against Ravenclaw. You know, Harry, in a way, you did see your father
last night... You found him (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) inside yourself.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Dumbledore/Albus Dumbledore</b></font>)</div><p/>And Dumbledore left the office, leaving Harry to his (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) very confused
thoughts.

<p/>Nobody at Hogwarts now knew the truth of what had happened the night
that Sirius, Buckbeak, and Pettigrew had vanished except Harry, Ron,
Hermione, and Professor Dumbledore. As the end of term approached, Harry
heard many different theories about what had really happened, but none
of them came close to the truth.

<p/>Malfoy was furious about Buckbeak. He (<font color='blue'><b>Malfoy</b></font>) was convinced that Hagrid had
found a way of smuggling the hippogriff to safety, and seemed outraged
that he (<font color='blue'><b>Malfoy</b></font>) and his (<font color='blue'><b>Malfoy</b></font>) father had been outwitted by a gamekeeper. Percy
Weasley, meanwhile, had much to say on the subject of Sirius's escape.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``If I manage to get into the Ministry, I'll have a lot of proposals to
make about Magical Law Enforcement!''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Sirius</b></font>) told the only person who would
listen -- his (<font color='blue'><b>Sirius</b></font>) girlfriend, Penelope.

<p/>Though the weather was perfect, though the atmosphere was so

<p/>cheerful, though he (<font color='blue'><b>Sirius</b></font>) knew they had achieved the near impossible in
helping Sirius to freedom, Harry had never approached the end of a
school year in worse spirits.

<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) certainly wasn't the only one who was sorry to see Professor Lupin
go. The whole of Harry's Defense Against the Dark Arts class was
miserable about his (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) resignation.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Wonder what they'll give us next year?''  (<font color='red'><b>Seamus Finnigan/Seamus</b></font>)</div>said Seamus Finnigan gloomily.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Maybe a vampire,''  (<font color='red'><b>Dean Thomas/Dean</b></font>)</div>suggested Dean Thomas hopefully.

<p/>It wasn't only Professor Lupin's departure that was weighing on Harry's
mind. He (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) couldn't help thinking a lot about Professor Trelawney's
prediction. He (<font color='blue'><b>Professor</b></font>) kept wondering where Pettigrew was now, whether he (<font color='blue'><b>Pettigrew</b></font>) had
sought sanctuary with Voldemort yet. But the thing that was lowering
Harry's spirits most of all was the prospect of returning to the
Dursleys. For maybe half an hour, a glorious half hour, he (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) had believed
he (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) would be living with Sirius from now on... his (<font color='blue'><b>Sirius</b></font>) parents' best
friend... It would have been the next best thing to having his (<font color='blue'><b>Sirius</b></font>) own
father back. And while no news of Sirius was definitely good news,
because it meant he (<font color='blue'><b>Sirius</b></font>) had successfully gone into hiding, Harry couldn't
help feeling miserable when he (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) thought of the home he (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) might have had,
and the fact that it was now impossible.

<p/>The exam results came out on the last day of term. Harry, Ron, and
Hermione had passed every subject. Harry was amazed that he (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) had got
through Potions. He (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) had a shrewd suspicion that Dumbledore might have
stepped in to stop Snape failing him (<font color='blue'><b>Snape</b></font>) on purpose. Snape's behavior toward
Harry over the past week had been quite alarming. Harry wouldn't have
thought it possible that Snape's dislike for him (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) could increase, but it
certainly had. A muscle twitched unpleasantly at the corner of Snape's
thin mouth every time he (<font color='blue'><b>Snape</b></font>) looked at Harry, and he (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) was constantly flexing
his (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) fingers, as though itching to place them around Harry's throat.

<p/>Percy had got his (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) top-grade N.E.W.T.s; Fred and George had scraped a
handful of O.W.L.s each. Gryffindor House, meanwhile, largely thanks to
their spectacular performance in the Quidditch Cup, had won the House
championship for the third year running. This meant that the end of term
feast took place amid decorations of scarlet and gold, and that the
Gryffindor table was the noisiest of the lot, as everybody celebrated.
Even Harry managed to forget about the journey back to the Dursleys the
next day as he (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) ate, drank, talked, and laughed with the rest.

<p/>As the Hogwarts Express pulled out of the station the next mornIng,
Hermione gave Harry and Ron some surprising news.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``I went to see Professor McGonagall this morning, just before breakfast.
I've decided to drop Muggle Studies.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``But you passed your exam with three hundred and twenty percent!''  (<font color='red'><b>Ron</b></font>)</div>said
Ron.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``I know,''  (<font color='red'><b>Hermione/HERMIONE</b></font>)</div>sighed Hermione, <div class="bookquote">``but I can't stand another year like this
one. That Time-Turner, it was driving me mad. I've handed it in. Without
Muggle Studies and Divination, I'll be able to have a normal schedule
again.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Hermione/HERMIONE</b></font>)</div><p/>I still can't believe you didn't tell us about it,'' said Ron grumpily.
<div class="bookquote">``We're supposed to be your friends.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I promised I wouldn't tell anyone,''  (<font color='red'><b>Hermione/HERMIONE</b></font>)</div>said Hermione severely. She (<font color='blue'><b>Hermione</b></font>) looked
around at Harry, who was watching Hogwarts disappear from view behind a
mountain. Two whole months before he (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>)'d see it again...

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Oh, cheer up, Harry!''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>said Hermione sadly.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``I'm okay,''  (<font color='red'><b>Harry/Potter/Harry Potter</b></font>)</div>said Harry quickly. <div class="bookquote">``Just thinking about the holidays.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Yeah, I've been thinking about them too,''  (<font color='red'><b>Ron</b></font>)</div>said Ron. <div class="bookquote">``Harry, you've got
to come and stay with us. I'll fix it up with Mum and Dad, then I'll
call you. I know how to use a fellytone now --''

 (<font color='red'><b>Hermione/HERMIONE</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``A telephone, Ron,''  (<font color='red'><b>Hermione/HERMIONE</b></font>)</div>said Hermione. <div class="bookquote">``Honestly, you should take Muggle
Studies next year...''

 (<font color='red'><b>Ron</b></font>)</div><p/>Ron *ignored her (<font color='blue'><b>Hermione</b></font>).

<p/><div class="bookquote">``It's the Quidditch World Cup this summer! How about it, Harry? Come and
stay, and we'll go and see it! Dad can usually get tickets from work.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Harry/Potter/Harry Potter</b></font>)</div><p/>This proposal had the effect of cheering Harry up a great deal.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Yeah... I bet the Dursleys'd be pleased to let me come... especially
after what I did to Aunt Marge...''

 (<font color='red'><b>Harry/Potter/Harry Potter</b></font>)</div><p/>Feeling considerably more cheerful, Harry joined Ron and Hermione in
several games of Exploding Snap, and when the witch with the tea cart
arrived, he (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) bought himself a very large lunch, though nothing with
chocolate in it.

<p/>But it was late in the afternoon before the thing that made him (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) truly
happy turned up...

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Harry,''  (<font color='red'><b>him</b></font>)</div>said Hermione suddenly, peering over his (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) shoulder. <div class="bookquote">``What's that
thing outside your window?''

 (<font color='red'><b>Harry/Potter/Harry Potter</b></font>)</div><p/>Harry turned to look outside. Something very small and gray was bobbing
in and out of sight beyond the glass. He (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) stood up for a better look and
saw that it was a tiny owl, carrying a letter that was much too big for
it. The owl was so small, in fact, that it kept tumbling over in the
air, buffeted this way and that in the train's slipstream. Harry quickly
pulled down the window, stretched out his (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) arm, and caught it. It felt
like a very fluffy Snitch. He (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) brought it carefully inside. The owl
dropped its letter onto Harry's seat and began zooming around their
compartment, apparently very pleased with itself for accomplishing its
task. Hedwig clicked her (<font color='blue'><b>Hedwig</b></font>) beak with a sort of dignified disapproval.
Crookshanks sat up in his (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) seat, following the owl with his (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) great yellow
eyes. Ron, noticing this, snatched the owl safely out of harm's way.

<p/>Harry picked up the letter. It was addressed to him (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>). He (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) ripped open the
letter, and shouted, <div class="bookquote">``It's from Sirius!''

 (<font color='red'><b>He</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``What?''  (<font color='red'><b>Ron</b></font>)</div>said Ron and Hermione excitedly. <div class="bookquote">``Read it aloud!''

 (<font color='red'><b>Dear Harry</b></font>)</div><p/>Dear Harry,

<p/>I hope this finds you before you reach your aunt and uncle. I don't know
whether they're used to owl post.

<p/>Buckbeak and I are in hiding. I won't tell you where, in case this owl
falls into the wrong hands. I have some doubt about his (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) reliability, but
he (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) is the best I could find, and he (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) did seem eager for the job.

<p/>I believe the dementors are still searching for me, but they haven't a
hope of finding me here. I am planning to allow some Muggles to glimpse
me soon, a long way from Hogwarts, so that the security on the castle
will be lifted.

<p/>There is something I never got around to telling you during our brief
meeting. It was I who sent you the Firebolt --

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Ha!''  (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div>said Hermione triumphantly. <div class="bookquote">``See! I told you it was from him (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>)!''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Yes, but he (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) hadn't jinxed it, had he (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>)?''  (<font color='red'><b>Ron</b></font>)</div>said Ron. <div class="bookquote">``Ouch!''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>The tiny owl,
now hooting happily in his (<font color='blue'><b>Ron</b></font>) hand, had nibbled one of his (<font color='blue'><b>Ron</b></font>) fingers in what
it seemed to think was an affectionate way.

<p/>Crookshanks took the order to the Owl Office for me. I used your name
but told them to take the gold from my own Gringotts vault. Please
consider it as thirteen birthdays' worth of presents from your
godfather.

<p/>I would also like to apologize for the fright I think I gave you that
night last year when you left your uncle's house. I had only hoped to
get a glimpse of you before starting my journey north, but I think the
sight of me alarmed you.

<p/>I am enclosing something else for you, which I think will make your next
year at Hogwarts more enjoyable.

<p/>If ever you need me, send word. Your owl will find me.

<p/>I'll write again soon.

<p/>Sirius

<p/>Harry looked eagerly inside the envelope. There was another piece of
parchment in there. He (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) read it through quickly and felt suddenly as warm
and contented as though he (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>)'d swallowed a bottle of hot butterbeer in one
gulp.

<p/>I, Sirius Black, Harry Potter's godfather, hereby give him (<font color='blue'><b>Black</b></font>) permission to
visit Hogsmeade on weekends.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``That'll be good enough for Dumbledore!''  (<font color='red'><b>Harry/Potter/Harry Potter</b></font>)</div>said Harry happily. He (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) looked
back at Sirius's letter. <div class="bookquote">``Hang on, there's a RS...''

 (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div><p/>I thought your ftiend Ron might like to keep this owl, as it's my fault
he (<font color='blue'><b>Ron</b></font>) no longer has a rat.

<p/>Ron's eyes widened. The minute owl was still hooting excitedly. <div class="bookquote">``Keep
him (<font color='blue'><b>Dumbledore</b></font>)?''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Ron</b></font>) said uncertainly. He (<font color='blue'><b>Ron</b></font>) looked closely at the owl for a moment;
then, to Harry's and Hermione's great surprise, he (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) held him (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) out for
Crookshanks to sniff.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``What do you reckon?''  (<font color='red'><b>Ron</b></font>)</div>Ron asked the cat. <div class="bookquote">``Definitely an owl?''

 (<font color='red'><b>Crookshanks</b></font>)</div><p/>Crookshanks purred.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``That's good enough for me,''  (<font color='red'><b>Ron</b></font>)</div>said Ron happily. <div class="bookquote">``He (<font color='blue'><b>Dumbledore</b></font>)'s mine.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Harry/Potter/Harry Potter</b></font>)</div><p/>Harry read and reread the letter from Sirius all the way back into
King's Cross station. It was still clutched tightly in his (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) hand as he (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>),
Ron, and Hermione stepped back through the barrier of platform nine an-LRB-'
three-quarters. Harry spotted Uncle Vernon at once. He (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) was standing a
good distance from Mr. and Mrs. Weasley, eyeing them suspiciously, and
when Mrs. Weasley hugged Harry in greeting, his (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) worst suspicions about
them seemed confirmed.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``I'll call about the World Cup!''  (<font color='red'><b>Ron</b></font>)</div>Ron yelled after Harry as Harry bid him (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>)
and Hermione good-bye, then wheeled the trolley bearing his (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) trunk and
Hedwig's cage toward Uncle Vernon, who greeted him (<font color='blue'><b>Vernon</b></font>) in his (<font color='blue'><b>Vernon</b></font>) usual fashion.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``What's that?''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Vernon</b></font>) snarled, staring at the envelope Harry was still
clutching in his (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) hand. <div class="bookquote">``If it's another form for me to sign, you've got
another --''

 (<font color='red'><b>Harry/Potter/Harry Potter</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``It's not,''  (<font color='red'><b>Harry/Potter/Harry Potter</b></font>)</div>said Harry cheerfully. <div class="bookquote">``It's a letter from my godfather.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Godfather?''  (<font color='red'><b>Uncle</b></font>)</div>sputtered Uncle Vernon. <div class="bookquote">``You haven't got a godfather!''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Yes, I have,''  (<font color='red'><b>Harry/Potter/Harry Potter</b></font>)</div>said Harry brightly. <div class="bookquote">``He (<font color='blue'><b>godfather</b></font>) was my mum and dad's best
friend. He (<font color='blue'><b>godfather</b></font>)'s a convicted murderer, but he (<font color='blue'><b>godfather</b></font>)'s broken out of wizard prison
and he (<font color='blue'><b>godfather</b></font>)'s on the run. He (<font color='blue'><b>godfather</b></font>) likes to keep in touch with me, though... keep
up with my news... check if I'm happy...''

 (<font color='red'><b>Uncle</b></font>)</div><p/>And, grinning broadly at the look of horror on Uncle Vernon's face,
Harry set off toward the station exit, Hedwig rattling along in front of
him (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>), for what looked like a much better summer than the last.

<p/>THE END
