Take this advice : the first and last I shall offer you ; then you will not want me or any one else , happen what may . Neglect it -- go on as heretofore , craving , whining , and idling -- and suffer the results of your idiocy , however bad and insuperable they may be . I tell you this plainly ; and listen : for though I shall no more repeat what I am now about to say , I shall steadily act on it . After my mother 's death , I wash my hands of you : from the day her coffin is carried to the vault in Gateshead Church , you and I will be as separate as if we had never known each other . You need not think that because we chanced to be born of the same parents , I shall suffer you to fasten me down by even the feeblest claim : I can tell you this -- if the whole human race , ourselves excepted , were swept away , and we two stood alone on the earth , I would leave you in the old world , and betake myself to the new .

If he had but been able to look to a distance , and see how what they call the spirit of the age was tending ! Still , I like Charles -- I respect him -- I pity him , poor murdered king !

We are , and must be , one and all , burdened with faults in this world : but the time will soon come when , I trust , we shall put them off in putting off our corruptible bodies ; when debasement and sin will fall from us with this cumbrous frame of flesh , and only the spark of the spirit will remain , -- the impalpable principle of light and thought , pure as when it left the Creator to inspire the creature : whence it came it will return ; perhaps again to be communicated to some being higher than man -- perhaps to pass through gradations of glory , from the pale human soul to brighten to the seraph ! Surely it will never , on the contrary , be suffered to degenerate from man to fiend ? No ; I can not believe that : I hold another creed : which no one ever taught me , and which I seldom mention ; but in which I delight , and to which I cling : for it extends hope to all : it makes Eternity a rest -- a mighty home , not a terror and an abyss . Besides , with this creed , I can so clearly distinguish between the criminal and his crime ; I can so sincerely forgive the first while I abhor the last : with this creed revenge never worries my heart , degradation never too deeply disgusts me , injustice never crushes me too low : I live in calm , looking to the end .

He would send for the baby ; though I entreated him rather to put it out to nurse and pay for its maintenance . I hated it the first time I set my eyes on it -- a sickly , whining , pining thing ! It would wail in its cradle all night long -- not screaming heartily like any other child , but whimpering and moaning . Reed pitied it ; and he used to nurse it and notice it as if it had been his own : more , indeed , than he ever noticed his own at that age . He would try to make my children friendly to the little beggar : the darlings could not bear it , and he was angry with them when they showed their dislike . In his last illness , he had it brought continually to his bedside ; and but an hour before he died , he bound me by vow to keep the creature . I would as soon have been charged with a pauper brat out of a workhouse : but he was weak , naturally weak . John does not at all resemble his father , and I am glad of it : John is like me and like my brothers -- he is quite a Gibson . Oh , I wish he would cease tormenting me with letters for money ? I have no more money to give him : we are getting poor . I must send away half the servants and shut up part of the house ; or let it off . I can never submit to do that -- yet how are we to get on ? Two-thirds of my income goes in paying the interest of mortgages . John gambles dreadfully , and always loses -- poor boy !
