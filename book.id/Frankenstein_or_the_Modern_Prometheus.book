Yet I am certainly unjust . Everybody believed that poor girl to be guilty ; and if she could have committed the crime for which she suffered , assuredly she would have been the most depraved of human creatures . For the sake of a few jewels , to have murdered the son of her benefactor and friend , a child whom she had nursed from its birth , and appeared to love as if it had been her own ! I could not consent to the death of any human being , but certainly I should have thought such a creature unfit to remain in the society of men . But she was innocent . I know , I feel she was innocent ; you are of the same opinion , and that confirms me . Alas ! Victor , when falsehood can look so like the truth , who can assure themselves of certain happiness ? I feel as if I were walking on the edge of a precipice , towards which thousands are crowding and endeavouring to plunge me into the abyss .
