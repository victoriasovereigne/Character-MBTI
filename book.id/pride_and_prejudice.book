I often tell young ladies that no excellence in music is to be acquired without constant practice . I have told Miss Bennet several times , that she will never play really well unless she practises more ; and though Mrs. Collins has no instrument , she is very welcome , as I have often told her , to come to Rosings every day , and play on the pianoforte in Mrs. Jenkinson 's room .

Lady Catherine was reckoned proud by many people he knew , but _ he _ had never seen anything but affability in her . She had always spoken to him as she would to any other gentleman ; she made not the smallest objection to his joining in the society of the neighbourhood nor to his leaving the parish occasionally for a week or two , to visit his relations . She had even condescended to advise him to marry as soon as he could , provided he chose with discretion ; and had once paid him a visit in his humble parsonage , where she had perfectly approved all the alterations he had been making , and had even vouchsafed to suggest some herself -- some shelves in the closet up stairs .

I do not mean , however , to assert that we can be justified in devoting too much of our time to music , for there are certainly other things to be attended to . The rector of a parish has much to do . In the first place , he must make such an agreement for tithes as may be beneficial to himself and not offensive to his patron . He must write his own sermons ; and the time that remains will not be too much for his parish duties , and the care and improvement of his dwelling , which he can not be excused from making as comfortable as possible . And I do not think it of light importance that he should have attentive and conciliatory manners towards everybody , especially towards those to whom he owes his preferment . I can not acquit him of that duty ; nor could I think well of the man who should omit an occasion of testifying his respect towards anybody connected with the family .

You can hardly doubt the purport of my discourse , however your natural delicacy may lead you to dissemble ; my attentions have been too marked to be mistaken . Almost as soon as I entered the house , I singled you out as the companion of my future life .

Resignation to inevitable evils is the duty of us all ; the peculiar duty of a young man who has been so fortunate as I have been in early preferment ; and I trust I am resigned . Perhaps not the less so from feeling a doubt of my positive happiness had my fair cousin honoured me with her hand ; for I have often observed that resignation is never so perfect as when the blessing denied begins to lose somewhat of its value in our estimation . You will not , I hope , consider me as showing any disrespect to your family , my dear madam , by thus withdrawing my pretensions to your daughter 's favour , without having paid yourself and Mr. Bennet the compliment of requesting you to interpose your authority in my behalf . My conduct may , I fear , be objectionable in having accepted my dismission from your daughter 's lips instead of your own . But we are all liable to error .

I have scarcely any hesitation in saying she will include you and my sister Maria in every invitation with which she honours us during your stay here . Her behaviour to my dear Charlotte is charming . We dine at Rosings twice every week , and are never allowed to walk home . Her ladyship 's carriage is regularly ordered for us .

Our plain manner of living , our small rooms and few domestics , and the little we see of the world , must make Hunsford extremely dull to a young lady like yourself ; but I hope you will believe us grateful for the condescension , and that we have done everything in our power to prevent your spending your time unpleasantly .

Our situation with regard to Lady Catherine 's family is indeed the sort of extraordinary advantage and blessing which few can boast . You see on what a footing we are . You see how continually we are engaged there .

I thought it my duty to give the speediest intelligence of this to my cousin , that she and her noble admirer may be aware of what they are about , and not run hastily into a marriage which has not been properly sanctioned .

I must not , however , neglect the duties of my station , or refrain from declaring my amazement at hearing that you received the young couple into your house as soon as they were married . It was an encouragement of vice ; and had I been the rector of Longbourn , I should very strenuously have opposed it .

We must not be so ready to fancy ourselves intentionally injured . We must not expect a lively young man to be always so guarded and circumspect .

If they believed him attached to me , they would not try to part us ; if he were so , they could not succeed . By supposing such an affection , you make everybody acting unnaturally and wrong , and me most unhappy . Do not distress me by the idea .

It had come with a fare from London ; and as he thought that the circumstance of a gentleman and lady 's removing from one carriage into another might be remarked he meant to make inquiries at Clapham . If he could anyhow discover at what house the coachman had before set down his fare , he determined to make inquiries there , and hoped it might not be impossible to find out the stand and number of the coach .

Promise me , therefore , to come to Hunsford . '' ","i":53851},{"w":"`` but she was very glad to see me , and reproached me for giving her no notice of my coming to London . I was right , therefore , my last letter had never reached her . I inquired after their brother , of course . He was well , but so much engaged with Mr. Darcy that they scarcely ever saw him . I found that Miss Darcy was expected to dinner . I wish I could see her . My visit was not long , as Caroline and Mrs. Hurst were going out . I dare say I shall see them soon here . '' ","i":54342},{"w":"`` My dearest Lizzy will , I am sure , be incapable of triumphing in her better judgement , at my expense , when I confess myself to have been entirely deceived in Miss Bingley 's regard for me . But , my dear sister , though the event has proved you right , do not think me obstinate if I still assert that , considering what her behaviour was , my confidence was as natural as your suspicion . I do not at all comprehend her reason for wishing to be intimate with me ; but if the same circumstances were to happen again , I am sure I should be deceived again . Caroline did not return my visit till yesterday ; and not a note , not a line , did I receive in the meantime . When she did come , it was very evident that she had no pleasure in it ; she made a slight , formal apology , for not calling before , said not a word of wishing to see me again , and was in every respect so altered a creature , that when she went away I was perfectly resolved to continue the acquaintance no longer . I pity , though I can not help blaming her . She was very wrong in singling me out as she did ; I can safely say that every advance to intimacy began on her side . But I pity her , because she must feel that she has been acting wrong , and because I am very sure that anxiety for her brother is the cause of it . I need not explain myself farther ; and though _ we _ know this anxiety to be quite needless , yet if she feels it , it will easily account for her behaviour to me ; and so deservedly dear as he is to his sister , whatever anxiety she must feel on his behalf is natural and amiable . I can not but wonder , however , at her having any such fears now , because , if he had at all cared about me , we must have met , long ago . He knows of my being in town , I am certain , from something she said herself ; and yet it would seem , by her manner of talking , as if she wanted to persuade herself that he is really partial to Miss Darcy . I can not understand it . If I were not afraid of judging harshly , I should be almost tempted to say that there is a strong appearance of duplicity in all this . But I will endeavour to banish every painful thought , and think only of what will make me happy -- your affection , and the invariable kindness of my dear uncle and aunt . Let me hear from you very soon . Miss Bingley said something of his never returning to Netherfield again , of giving up the house , but not with any certainty . We had better not mention it . I am extremely glad that you have such pleasant accounts from our friends at Hunsford . Pray go to see them , with Sir William and Maria . I am sure you will be very comfortable there . -- Yours , etc. '' ","i":54582},{"w":"`` Well , '' ","i":56792},{"w":"`` have it as you choose . _ He _ shall be mercenary , and _ she _ shall be foolish .

But I can not -- I have never desired your good opinion , and you have certainly bestowed it most unwillingly . I am sorry to have occasioned pain to anyone .

But disguise of every sort is my abhorrence . Nor am I ashamed of the feelings I related . They were natural and just .

What I have to say relates to poor Lydia . An express came at twelve last night , just as we were all gone to bed , from Colonel Forster , to inform us that she was gone off to Scotland with one of his officers ; to own the truth , with Wickham ! Imagine our surprise . To Kitty , however , it does not seem so wholly unexpected . I am very , very sorry . So imprudent a match on both sides ! But I am willing to hope the best , and that his character has been misunderstood . Thoughtless and indiscreet I can easily believe him , but this step -LRB- and let us rejoice over it -RRB- marks nothing bad at heart . His choice is disinterested at least , for he must know my father can give her nothing . Our poor mother is sadly grieved . My father bears it better . How thankful am I that we never let them know what has been said against him ; we must forget it ourselves . They were off Saturday night about twelve , as is conjectured , but were not missed till yesterday morning at eight . The express was sent off directly . My dear Lizzy , they must have passed within ten miles of us . Colonel Forster gives us reason to expect him here soon . Lydia left a few lines for his wife , informing her of their intention . I must conclude , for I can not be long from my poor mother . I am afraid you will not be able to make it out , but I hardly know what I have written . '' ","i":99154},{"w":"`` Oh ! where , where is my uncle ? '' ","i":100307},{"w":"`` Let me call your maid . Is there nothing you could take to give you present relief ?

But , really , I know not what to say . Perhaps I am not doing her justice . But she is very young ; she has never been taught to think on serious subjects ; and for the last half-year , nay , for a twelvemonth -- she has been given up to nothing but amusement and vanity . She has been allowed to dispose of her time in the most idle and frivolous manner , and to adopt any opinions that came in her way . Since the -- shire were first quartered in Meryton , nothing but love , flirtation , and officers have been in her head . She has been doing everything in her power by thinking and talking on the subject , to give greater -- what shall I call it ? susceptibility to her feelings ; which are naturally lively enough . And we all know that Wickham has every charm of person and address that can captivate a woman . '' ","i":103209},{"w":"`` I do indeed , '' ","i":103544},{"w":"`` But you -- how are you ?
