<p/>Chapter I. Into the Primitive


<p/><div class="bookquote">``Old longings nomadic leap,
Chafing at custom's chain;
Again from its brumal sleep
Wakens the ferine strain.''

 (<font color='red'><b>I.</b></font>)</div><p/>Buck did not read the newspapers, or he (<font color='blue'><b>Buck</b></font>) would have known that trouble
was brewing, not alone for himself, but for every tide-water dog, strong
of muscle and with warm, long hair, from Puget Sound to San Diego.
Because men, groping in the Arctic darkness, had found a yellow metal,
and because steamship and transportation companies were booming the
find, thousands of men were rushing into the Northland. These men wanted
dogs, and the dogs they wanted were heavy dogs, with strong muscles by
which to toil, and furry coats to protect them from the frost.

<p/>Buck lived at a big house in the sun-kissed Santa Clara Valley. Judge
Miller's place, it was called. It stood back from the road, half hidden
among the trees, through which glimpses could be caught of the wide
cool veranda that ran around its four sides. The house was approached by
gravelled driveways which wound about through wide-spreading lawns and
under the interlacing boughs of tall poplars. At the rear things were on
even a more spacious scale than at the front. There were great stables,
where a dozen grooms and boys held forth, rows of vine-clad servants'
cottages, an endless and orderly array of outhouses, long grape arbors,
green pastures, orchards, and berry patches. Then there was the pumping
plant for the artesian well, and the big cement tank where Judge
Miller's boys took their morning plunge and kept cool in the hot
afternoon.

<p/>And over this great demesne Buck ruled. Here he (<font color='blue'><b>Buck</b></font>) was born, and here he (<font color='blue'><b>Buck</b></font>)
had lived the four years of his (<font color='blue'><b>Buck</b></font>) life. It was true, there were other
dogs, There could not but be other dogs on so vast a place, but they did
not count. They came and went, resided in the populous kennels, or lived
obscurely in the recesses of the house after the fashion of Toots, the
Japanese pug, or Ysabel, the Mexican hairless,--strange creatures that
rarely put nose out of doors or set foot to ground. On the other hand,
there were the fox terriers, a score of them at least, who yelped
fearful promises at Toots and Ysabel looking out of the windows at them
and protected by a legion of housemaids armed with brooms and mops.

<p/>But Buck was neither house-dog nor kennel-dog. The whole realm was his (<font color='blue'><b>Buck</b></font>).
He (<font color='blue'><b>Buck</b></font>) plunged into the swimming tank or went hunting with the Judge's sons;
he (<font color='blue'><b>Judge</b></font>) escorted Mollie and Alice, the Judge's daughters, on long twilight
or early morning rambles; on wintry nights he (<font color='blue'><b>Judge</b></font>) lay at the Judge's feet
before the roaring library fire; he (<font color='blue'><b>Judge</b></font>) carried the Judge's grandsons on his (<font color='blue'><b>Judge</b></font>)
back, or rolled them in the grass, and guarded their footsteps through
wild adventures down to the fountain in the stable yard, and even
beyond, where the paddocks were, and the berry patches. Among the
terriers he (<font color='blue'><b>Judge</b></font>) stalked imperiously, and Toots and Ysabel he (<font color='blue'><b>Judge</b></font>) utterly
ignored, for he (<font color='blue'><b>Judge</b></font>) was king,--king over all creeping, crawling, flying
things of Judge Miller's place, humans included.

<p/>His (<font color='blue'><b>Judge</b></font>) father, Elmo, a huge St. Bernard, had been the Judge's inseparable
companion, and Buck bid fair to follow in the way of his (<font color='blue'><b>Buck</b></font>) father. He (<font color='blue'><b>Buck</b></font>) was
not so large,--he (<font color='blue'><b>Buck</b></font>) weighed only one hundred and forty pounds,--for his (<font color='blue'><b>Buck</b></font>)
mother, Shep, had been a Scotch shepherd dog. Nevertheless, one hundred
and forty pounds, to which was added the dignity that comes of good
living and universal respect, enabled him (<font color='blue'><b>Buck</b></font>) to carry himself in right
royal fashion. During the four years since his (<font color='blue'><b>Buck</b></font>) puppyhood he (<font color='blue'><b>Buck</b></font>) had lived
the life of a sated aristocrat; he (<font color='blue'><b>Buck</b></font>) had a fine pride in himself, was even
a trifle egotistical, as country gentlemen sometimes become because of
their insular situation. But he (<font color='blue'><b>Buck</b></font>) had saved himself by not becoming a mere
pampered house-dog. Hunting and kindred outdoor delights had kept down
the fat and hardened his (<font color='blue'><b>Buck</b></font>) muscles; and to him (<font color='blue'><b>Buck</b></font>), as to the cold-tubbing
races, the love of water had been a tonic and a health preserver.

<p/>And this was the manner of dog Buck was in the fall of 1897, when the
Klondike strike dragged men from all the world into the frozen North.
But Buck did not read the newspapers, and he (<font color='blue'><b>Buck</b></font>) did not know that Manuel,
one of the gardener's helpers, was an undesirable acquaintance. Manuel
had one besetting sin. He (<font color='blue'><b>Manuel</b></font>) loved to play Chinese lottery. Also, in his (<font color='blue'><b>Manuel</b></font>)
gambling, he (<font color='blue'><b>Manuel</b></font>) had one besetting weakness--faith in a system; and this
made his (<font color='blue'><b>Manuel</b></font>) damnation certain. For to play a system requires money, while
the wages of a gardener's helper do not lap over the needs of a wife and
numerous progeny.

<p/>The Judge was at a meeting of the Raisin Growers' Association, and the
boys were busy organizing an athletic club, on the memorable night of
Manuel's treachery. No one saw him (<font color='blue'><b>Manuel</b></font>) and Buck go off through the orchard
on what Buck imagined was merely a stroll. And with the exception of a
solitary man, no one saw them arrive at the little flag station known
as College Park. This man talked with Manuel, and money chinked between
them.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``You might wrap up the goods before you deliver 'm,''  (<font color='red'><b>the stranger</b></font>)</div>the stranger said
gruffly, and Manuel doubled a piece of stout rope around Buck's neck
under the collar.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Twist it, an' you'll choke 'm plentee,''  (<font color='red'><b>Manuel</b></font>)</div>said Manuel, and the stranger
grunted a ready affirmative.

<p/>Buck had accepted the rope with quiet dignity. To be sure, it was an
unwonted performance: but he (<font color='blue'><b>Buck</b></font>) had learned to trust in men he (<font color='blue'><b>Buck</b></font>) knew, and to
give them credit for a wisdom that outreached his (<font color='blue'><b>Buck</b></font>) own. But when the ends
of the rope were placed in the stranger's hands, he (<font color='blue'><b>stranger</b></font>) growled menacingly.
He (<font color='blue'><b>stranger</b></font>) had merely intimated his (<font color='blue'><b>stranger</b></font>) displeasure, in his (<font color='blue'><b>stranger</b></font>) pride believing that to
intimate was to command. But to his (<font color='blue'><b>stranger</b></font>) surprise the rope tightened around
his (<font color='blue'><b>stranger</b></font>) neck, shutting off his (<font color='blue'><b>stranger</b></font>) breath. In quick rage he (<font color='blue'><b>stranger</b></font>) sprang at the man,
who met him (<font color='blue'><b>stranger</b></font>) halfway, grappled him (<font color='blue'><b>stranger</b></font>) close by the throat, and with a deft
twist threw him (<font color='blue'><b>stranger</b></font>) over on his (<font color='blue'><b>stranger</b></font>) back. Then the rope tightened mercilessly,
while Buck struggled in a fury, his (<font color='blue'><b>Buck</b></font>) tongue lolling out of his (<font color='blue'><b>Buck</b></font>) mouth and
his (<font color='blue'><b>Buck</b></font>) great chest panting futilely. Never in all his (<font color='blue'><b>Buck</b></font>) life had he (<font color='blue'><b>Buck</b></font>) been so
vilely treated, and never in all his (<font color='blue'><b>Buck</b></font>) life had he (<font color='blue'><b>Buck</b></font>) been so angry. But his (<font color='blue'><b>Buck</b></font>)
strength ebbed, his (<font color='blue'><b>Buck</b></font>) eyes glazed, and he (<font color='blue'><b>Buck</b></font>) knew nothing when the train was
flagged and the two men threw him (<font color='blue'><b>Buck</b></font>) into the baggage car.

<p/>The next he (<font color='blue'><b>Buck</b></font>) knew, he (<font color='blue'><b>Buck</b></font>) was dimly aware that his (<font color='blue'><b>Buck</b></font>) tongue was hurting and
that he (<font color='blue'><b>Buck</b></font>) was being jolted along in some kind of a conveyance. The hoarse
shriek of a locomotive whistling a crossing told him (<font color='blue'><b>Buck</b></font>) where he (<font color='blue'><b>Buck</b></font>) was. He (<font color='blue'><b>Buck</b></font>)
had travelled too often with the Judge not to know the sensation of
riding in a baggage car. He (<font color='blue'><b>Judge</b></font>) opened his (<font color='blue'><b>Judge</b></font>) eyes, and into them came the
unbridled anger of a kidnapped king. The man sprang for his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) throat, but
Buck was too quick for him (<font color='blue'><b>Buck</b></font>). His (<font color='blue'><b>Buck</b></font>) jaws closed on the hand, nor did they
relax till his (<font color='blue'><b>Buck</b></font>) senses were choked out of him (<font color='blue'><b>Buck</b></font>) once more.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Yep, has fits,''  (<font color='red'><b>the man</b></font>)</div>the man said, hiding his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) mangled hand from the
baggageman, who had been attracted by the sounds of struggle. ``I'm
takin' 'm up for the boss to <div class="bookquote">``Frisco. A crack dog-doctor there thinks
that he (<font color='blue'><b>boss</b></font>) can cure 'm.''

 (<font color='red'><b>the man</b></font>)</div><p/>Concerning that night's ride, the man spoke most eloquently for himself,
in a little shed back of a saloon on the San Francisco water front.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``All I get is fifty for it,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Francisco</b></font>) grumbled; <div class="bookquote">``an' I wouldn't do it over for
a thousand, cold cash.''

 (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div><p/>His (<font color='blue'><b>Francisco</b></font>) hand was wrapped in a bloody handkerchief, and the right trouser leg
was ripped from knee to ankle.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``How much did the other mug get?''  (<font color='red'><b>the saloon-keeper</b></font>)</div>the saloon-keeper demanded.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``A hundred,''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>was the reply. <div class="bookquote">``Wouldn't take a sou less, so help me.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``That makes a hundred and fifty,''  (<font color='red'><b>the saloon-keeper</b></font>)</div>the saloon-keeper calculated; <div class="bookquote">``and
he (<font color='blue'><b>boss</b></font>)'s worth it, or I'm a squarehead.''

 (<font color='red'><b>the saloon-keeper</b></font>)</div><p/>The kidnapper undid the bloody wrappings and looked at his (<font color='blue'><b>kidnapper</b></font>) lacerated
hand. <div class="bookquote">``If I don't get the hydrophoby--''

 (<font color='red'><b>the saloon-keeper</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``It'll be because you was born to hang,''  (<font color='red'><b>the saloon-keeper</b></font>)</div>laughed the saloon-keeper.
<div class="bookquote">``Here, lend me a hand before you pull your freight,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>kidnapper</b></font>) added.

<p/>Dazed, suffering intolerable pain from throat and tongue, with the life
half throttled out of him (<font color='blue'><b>kidnapper</b></font>), Buck attempted to face his (<font color='blue'><b>Buck</b></font>) tormentors. But he (<font color='blue'><b>Buck</b></font>)
was thrown down and choked repeatedly, till they succeeded in filing the
heavy brass collar from off his (<font color='blue'><b>Buck</b></font>) neck. Then the rope was removed, and he (<font color='blue'><b>Buck</b></font>)
was flung into a cagelike crate.

<p/>There he (<font color='blue'><b>Buck</b></font>) lay for the remainder of the weary night, nursing his (<font color='blue'><b>Buck</b></font>) wrath and
wounded pride. He (<font color='blue'><b>Buck</b></font>) could not understand what it all meant. What did they
want with him (<font color='blue'><b>Buck</b></font>), these strange men? Why were they keeping him (<font color='blue'><b>Buck</b></font>) pent up in
this narrow crate? He (<font color='blue'><b>Buck</b></font>) did not know why, but he (<font color='blue'><b>Buck</b></font>) felt oppressed by the
vague sense of impending calamity. Several times during the night he (<font color='blue'><b>Buck</b></font>)
sprang to his (<font color='blue'><b>Buck</b></font>) feet when the shed door rattled open, expecting to see the
Judge, or the boys at least. But each time it was the bulging face of
the saloon-keeper that peered in at him (<font color='blue'><b>Judge</b></font>) by the sickly light of a tallow
candle. And each time the joyful bark that trembled in Buck's throat was
twisted into a savage growl.

<p/>But the saloon-keeper let him (<font color='blue'><b>Buck</b></font>) alone, and in the morning four men entered
and picked up the crate. More tormentors, Buck decided, for they were
evil-looking creatures, ragged and unkempt; and he (<font color='blue'><b>Buck</b></font>) stormed and raged at
them through the bars. They only laughed and poked sticks at him (<font color='blue'><b>Buck</b></font>), which
he (<font color='blue'><b>Buck</b></font>) promptly assailed with his (<font color='blue'><b>Buck</b></font>) teeth till he (<font color='blue'><b>Buck</b></font>) realized that that was what
they wanted. Whereupon he (<font color='blue'><b>Buck</b></font>) lay down sullenly and allowed the crate to be
lifted into a wagon. Then he (<font color='blue'><b>Buck</b></font>), and the crate in which he (<font color='blue'><b>Buck</b></font>) was imprisoned,
began a passage through many hands. Clerks in the express office took
charge of him (<font color='blue'><b>Buck</b></font>); he (<font color='blue'><b>Buck</b></font>) was carted about in another wagon; a truck carried
him (<font color='blue'><b>Buck</b></font>), with an assortment of boxes and parcels, upon a ferry steamer; he (<font color='blue'><b>Buck</b></font>)
was trucked off the steamer into a great railway depot, and finally he (<font color='blue'><b>Buck</b></font>)
was deposited in an express car.

<p/>For two days and nights this express car was dragged along at the tail
of shrieking locomotives; and for two days and nights Buck neither ate
nor drank. In his (<font color='blue'><b>Buck</b></font>) anger he (<font color='blue'><b>Buck</b></font>) had met the first advances of the express
messengers with growls, and they had retaliated by teasing him (<font color='blue'><b>Buck</b></font>). When he (<font color='blue'><b>Buck</b></font>)
flung himself against the bars, quivering and frothing, they laughed
at him (<font color='blue'><b>Buck</b></font>) and taunted him (<font color='blue'><b>Buck</b></font>). They growled and barked like detestable dogs,
mewed, and flapped their arms and crowed. It was all very silly, he (<font color='blue'><b>Buck</b></font>)
knew; but therefore the more outrage to his (<font color='blue'><b>Buck</b></font>) dignity, and his (<font color='blue'><b>Buck</b></font>) anger waxed
and waxed. He (<font color='blue'><b>Buck</b></font>) did not mind the hunger so much, but the lack of water
caused him (<font color='blue'><b>Buck</b></font>) severe suffering and fanned his (<font color='blue'><b>Buck</b></font>) wrath to fever-pitch. For
that matter, high-strung and finely sensitive, the ill treatment had
flung him (<font color='blue'><b>Buck</b></font>) into a fever, which was fed by the inflammation of his (<font color='blue'><b>Buck</b></font>) parched
and swollen throat and tongue.

<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Buck</b></font>) was glad for one thing: the rope was off his (<font color='blue'><b>Buck</b></font>) neck. That had given
them an unfair advantage; but now that it was off, he (<font color='blue'><b>Buck</b></font>) would show them.
They would never get another rope around his (<font color='blue'><b>Buck</b></font>) neck. Upon that he (<font color='blue'><b>Buck</b></font>) was
resolved. For two days and nights he (<font color='blue'><b>Buck</b></font>) neither ate nor drank, and during
those two days and nights of torment, he (<font color='blue'><b>Buck</b></font>) accumulated a fund of wrath
that boded ill for whoever first fell foul of him (<font color='blue'><b>Buck</b></font>). His (<font color='blue'><b>Buck</b></font>) eyes turned
blood-shot, and he (<font color='blue'><b>Buck</b></font>) was metamorphosed into a raging fiend. So changed was
he (<font color='blue'><b>Buck</b></font>) that the Judge himself would not have recognized him (<font color='blue'><b>Judge</b></font>); and the express
messengers breathed with relief when they bundled him (<font color='blue'><b>Judge</b></font>) off the train at
Seattle.

<p/>Four men gingerly carried the crate from the wagon into a small,
high-walled back yard. A stout man, with a red sweater that sagged
generously at the neck, came out and signed the book for the driver.
That was the man, Buck divined, the next tormentor, and he (<font color='blue'><b>Buck</b></font>) hurled
himself savagely against the bars. The man smiled grimly, and brought a
hatchet and a club.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``You ain't going to take him (<font color='blue'><b>boss</b></font>) out now?''  (<font color='red'><b>the driver</b></font>)</div>the driver asked.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Sure,''  (<font color='red'><b>the man</b></font>)</div>the man replied, driving the hatchet into the crate for a pry.

<p/>There was an instantaneous scattering of the four men who had carried
it in, and from safe perches on top the wall they prepared to watch the
performance.

<p/>Buck rushed at the splintering wood, sinking his (<font color='blue'><b>Buck</b></font>) teeth into it, surging
and wrestling with it. Wherever the hatchet fell on the outside, he (<font color='blue'><b>Buck</b></font>) was
there on the inside, snarling and growling, as furiously anxious to get
out as the man in the red sweater was calmly intent on getting him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) out.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Now, you red-eyed devil,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) said, when he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) had made an opening
sufficient for the passage of Buck's body. At the same time he (<font color='blue'><b>Buck</b></font>) dropped
the hatchet and shifted the club to his (<font color='blue'><b>Buck</b></font>) right hand.

<p/>And Buck was truly a red-eyed devil, as he (<font color='blue'><b>Buck</b></font>) drew himself together for the
spring, hair bristling, mouth foaming, a mad glitter in his (<font color='blue'><b>Buck</b></font>) blood-shot
eyes. Straight at the man he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) launched his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) one hundred and forty pounds
of fury, surcharged with the pent passion of two days and nights. In
mid air, just as his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) jaws were about to close on the man, he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) received
a shock that checked his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) body and brought his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) teeth together with an
agonizing clip. He (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) whirled over, fetching the ground on his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) back and
side. He (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) had never been struck by a club in his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) life, and did not
understand. With a snarl that was part bark and more scream he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) was again
on his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) feet and launched into the air. And again the shock came and he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>)
was brought crushingly to the ground. This time he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) was aware that it was
the club, but his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) madness knew no caution. A dozen times he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) charged, and
as often the club broke the charge and smashed him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) down.

<p/>After a particularly fierce blow, he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) crawled to his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) feet, too dazed to
rush. He (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) staggered limply about, the blood flowing from nose and mouth
and ears, his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) beautiful coat sprayed and flecked with bloody slaver.
Then the man advanced and deliberately dealt him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) a frightful blow on
the nose. All the pain he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) had endured was as nothing compared with the
exquisite agony of this. With a roar that was almost lionlike in its
ferocity, he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) again hurled himself at the man. But the man, shifting the
club from right to left, coolly caught him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) by the under jaw, at the same
time wrenching downward and backward. Buck described a complete circle
in the air, and half of another, then crashed to the ground on his (<font color='blue'><b>Buck</b></font>) head
and chest.

<p/>For the last time he (<font color='blue'><b>Buck</b></font>) rushed. The man struck the shrewd blow he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) had
purposely withheld for so long, and Buck crumpled up and went down,
knocked utterly senseless.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``He (<font color='blue'><b>devil</b></font>)'s no slouch at dog-breakin', that's wot I say,''  (<font color='red'><b>the men</b></font>)</div>one of the men on
the wall cried enthusiastically.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Druther break cayuses any day, and twice on Sundays,''  (<font color='red'><b>the driver</b></font>)</div>was the reply of
the driver, as he (<font color='blue'><b>driver</b></font>) climbed on the wagon and started the horses.

<p/>Buck's senses came back to him (<font color='blue'><b>Buck</b></font>), but not his (<font color='blue'><b>Buck</b></font>) strength. He (<font color='blue'><b>Buck</b></font>) lay where he (<font color='blue'><b>Buck</b></font>)
had fallen, and from there he (<font color='blue'><b>Buck</b></font>) watched the man in the red sweater.

<p/><div class="bookquote">''`Answers to the name of Buck,'''  (<font color='red'><b>the man</b></font>)</div>the man soliloquized, quoting from the
saloon-keeper's letter which had announced the consignment of the crate
and contents. <div class="bookquote">``Well, Buck, my boy,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Buck</b></font>) went on in a genial voice, <div class="bookquote">``we've
had our little ruction, and the best thing we can do is to let it go at
that. You've learned your place, and I know mine. Be a good dog and all
'll go well and the goose hang high. Be a bad dog, and I'll whale the
stuffin' outa you. Understand?''

 (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div><p/>As he (<font color='blue'><b>Buck</b></font>) spoke he (<font color='blue'><b>Buck</b></font>) fearlessly patted the head he (<font color='blue'><b>Buck</b></font>) had so mercilessly pounded,
and though Buck's hair involuntarily bristled at touch of the hand,
he (<font color='blue'><b>Buck</b></font>) endured it without protest. When the man brought him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) water he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) drank
eagerly, and later bolted a generous meal of raw meat, chunk by chunk,
from the man's hand.

<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) was beaten -LRB-he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) knew that-RRB-; but he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) was not broken. He (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) saw, once for
all, that he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) stood no chance against a man with a club. He (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) had learned
the lesson, and in all his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) after life he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) never forgot it. That club was
a revelation. It was his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) introduction to the reign of primitive law,
and he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) met the introduction halfway. The facts of life took on a fiercer
aspect; and while he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) faced that aspect uncowed, he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) faced it with all the
latent cunning of his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) nature aroused. As the days went by, other dogs
came, in crates and at the ends of ropes, some docilely, and some raging
and roaring as he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) had come; and, one and all, he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) watched them pass
under the dominion of the man in the red sweater. Again and again, as he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>)
looked at each brutal performance, the lesson was driven home to Buck:
a man with a club was a lawgiver, a master to be obeyed, though not
necessarily conciliated. Of this last Buck was never guilty, though he (<font color='blue'><b>Buck</b></font>)
did see beaten dogs that fawned upon the man, and wagged their tails,
and licked his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) hand. Also he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) saw one dog, that would neither conciliate
nor obey, finally killed in the struggle for mastery.

<p/>Now and again men came, strangers, who talked excitedly, wheedlingly,
and in all kinds of fashions to the man in the red sweater. And at such
times that money passed between them the strangers took one or more of
the dogs away with them. Buck wondered where they went, for they never
came back; but the fear of the future was strong upon him (<font color='blue'><b>Buck</b></font>), and he (<font color='blue'><b>Buck</b></font>) was
glad each time when he (<font color='blue'><b>Buck</b></font>) was not selected.

<p/>Yet his (<font color='blue'><b>Buck</b></font>) time came, in the end, in the form of a little weazened man who
spat broken English and many strange and uncouth exclamations which Buck
could not understand.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Sacredam!''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Buck</b></font>) cried, when his (<font color='blue'><b>Buck</b></font>) eyes lit upon Buck. <div class="bookquote">``Dat one dam bully
dog! Eh? How moch?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Three hundred, and a present at that,''  (<font color='red'><b>the man</b></font>)</div>was the prompt reply of the man
in the red sweater. <div class="bookquote">``And seem' it's government money, you ain't got no
kick coming, eh, Perrault?''

 (<font color='red'><b>Perrault</b></font>)</div><p/>Perrault grinned. Considering that the price of dogs had been boomed
skyward by the unwonted demand, it was not an unfair sum for so fine
an animal. The Canadian Government would be no loser, nor would its
despatches travel the slower. Perrault knew dogs, and when he (<font color='blue'><b>Perrault</b></font>) looked at
Buck he (<font color='blue'><b>Buck</b></font>) knew that he (<font color='blue'><b>Buck</b></font>) was one in a thousand--<div class="bookquote">``One in ten t`ousand,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Buck</b></font>)
commented mentally.

<p/>Buck saw money pass between them, and was not surprised when Curly, a
good-natured Newfoundland, and he (<font color='blue'><b>Curly</b></font>) were led away by the little weazened
man. That was the last he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) saw of the man in the red sweater, and as
Curly and he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) looked at receding Seattle from the deck of the Narwhal, it
was the last he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) saw of the warm Southland. Curly and he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) were taken below
by Perrault and turned over to a black-faced giant called Francois.
Perrault was a French-Canadian, and swarthy; but Francois was a
French-Canadian half-breed, and twice as swarthy. They were a new kind
of men to Buck -LRB-of which he (<font color='blue'><b>Buck</b></font>) was destined to see many more-RRB-, and while
he (<font color='blue'><b>Buck</b></font>) developed no affection for them, he (<font color='blue'><b>Buck</b></font>) none the less grew honestly to
respect them. He (<font color='blue'><b>Buck</b></font>) speedily learned that Perrault and Francois were fair
men, calm and impartial in administering justice, and too wise in the
way of dogs to be fooled by dogs.

<p/>In the `tween-decks of the Narwhal, Buck and Curly joined two other
dogs. One of them was a big, snow-white fellow from Spitzbergen who had
been brought away by a whaling captain, and who had later accompanied
a Geological Survey into the Barrens. He (<font color='blue'><b>captain</b></font>) was friendly, in a treacherous
sort of way, smiling into one's face the while he (<font color='blue'><b>captain</b></font>) meditated some
underhand trick, as, for instance, when he (<font color='blue'><b>captain</b></font>) stole from Buck's food at the
first meal. As Buck sprang to punish him (<font color='blue'><b>Buck</b></font>), the lash of Francois's whip
sang through the air, reaching the culprit first; and nothing remained
to Buck but to recover the bone. That was fair of Francois, he (<font color='blue'><b>Francois</b></font>) decided,
and the half-breed began his (<font color='blue'><b>Francois</b></font>) rise in Buck's estimation.

<p/>The other dog made no advances, nor received any; also, he (<font color='blue'><b>Buck</b></font>) did not
attempt to steal from the newcomers. He (<font color='blue'><b>Buck</b></font>) was a gloomy, morose fellow, and
he (<font color='blue'><b>Buck</b></font>) showed Curly plainly that all he (<font color='blue'><b>Buck</b></font>) desired was to be left alone, and
further, that there would be trouble if he (<font color='blue'><b>Buck</b></font>) were not left alone. <div class="bookquote">``Dave''
 (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Buck</b></font>) was called, and he (<font color='blue'><b>Buck</b></font>) ate and slept, or yawned between times, and took
interest in nothing, not even when the Narwhal crossed Queen Charlotte
Sound and rolled and pitched and bucked like a thing possessed. When
Buck and Curly grew excited, half wild with fear, he (<font color='blue'><b>Buck</b></font>) raised his (<font color='blue'><b>Buck</b></font>) head as
though annoyed, favored them with an incurious glance, yawned, and went
to sleep again.

<p/>Day and night the ship throbbed to the tireless pulse of the propeller,
and though one day was very like another, it was apparent to Buck that
the weather was steadily growing colder. At last, one morning, the
propeller was quiet, and the Narwhal was pervaded with an atmosphere of
excitement. He (<font color='blue'><b>Buck</b></font>) felt it, as did the other dogs, and knew that a change
was at hand. Francois leashed them and brought them on deck. At the
first step upon the cold surface, Buck's feet sank into a white mushy
something very like mud. He (<font color='blue'><b>Buck</b></font>) sprang back with a snort. More of this white
stuff was falling through the air. He (<font color='blue'><b>Buck</b></font>) shook himself, but more of it fell
upon him (<font color='blue'><b>Buck</b></font>). He (<font color='blue'><b>Buck</b></font>) sniffed it curiously, then licked some up on his (<font color='blue'><b>Buck</b></font>) tongue. It
bit like fire, and the next instant was gone. This puzzled him (<font color='blue'><b>Buck</b></font>). He (<font color='blue'><b>Buck</b></font>) tried
it again, with the same result. The onlookers laughed uproariously, and
he (<font color='blue'><b>Buck</b></font>) felt ashamed, he (<font color='blue'><b>Buck</b></font>) knew not why, for it was his (<font color='blue'><b>Buck</b></font>) first snow.




<p/>Chapter II. The Law of Club and Fang


<p/>Buck's first day on the Dyea beach was like a nightmare. Every hour was
filled with shock and surprise. He (<font color='blue'><b>Buck</b></font>) had been suddenly jerked from the
heart of civilization and flung into the heart of things primordial.
No lazy, sun-kissed life was this, with nothing to do but loaf and be
bored. Here was neither peace, nor rest, nor a moment's safety. All
was confusion and action, and every moment life and limb were in peril.
There was imperative need to be constantly alert; for these dogs and men
were not town dogs and men. They were savages, all of them, who knew no
law but the law of club and fang.

<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>savages</b></font>) had never seen dogs fight as these wolfish creatures fought, and his (<font color='blue'><b>savages</b></font>)
first experience taught him (<font color='blue'><b>savages</b></font>) an unforgetable lesson. It is true, it was
a vicarious experience, else he (<font color='blue'><b>savages</b></font>) would not have lived to profit by it.
Curly was the victim. They were camped near the log store, where she (<font color='blue'><b>They</b></font>), in
her (<font color='blue'><b>They</b></font>) friendly way, made advances to a husky dog the size of a full-grown
wolf, though not half so large as she (<font color='blue'><b>They</b></font>). There was no warning, only a leap
in like a flash, a metallic clip of teeth, a leap out equally swift, and
Curly's face was ripped open from eye to jaw.

<p/>It was the wolf manner of fighting, to strike and leap away; but there
was more to it than this. Thirty or forty huskies ran to the spot and
surrounded the combatants in an intent and silent circle. Buck did not
comprehend that silent intentness, nor the eager way with which they
were licking their chops. Curly rushed her (<font color='blue'><b>wolf</b></font>) antagonist, who struck again
and leaped aside. He (<font color='blue'><b>Buck</b></font>) met her (<font color='blue'><b>wolf</b></font>) next rush with his (<font color='blue'><b>Buck</b></font>) chest, in a peculiar
fashion that tumbled her (<font color='blue'><b>wolf</b></font>) off her (<font color='blue'><b>wolf</b></font>) feet. She (<font color='blue'><b>wolf</b></font>) never regained them, This
was what the onlooking huskies had waited for. They closed in upon her (<font color='blue'><b>wolf</b></font>),
snarling and yelping, and she (<font color='blue'><b>wolf</b></font>) was buried, screaming with agony, beneath
the bristling mass of bodies.

<p/>So sudden was it, and so unexpected, that Buck was taken aback. He (<font color='blue'><b>Buck</b></font>) saw
Spitz run out his (<font color='blue'><b>Spitz</b></font>) scarlet tongue in a way he (<font color='blue'><b>Spitz</b></font>) had of laughing; and he (<font color='blue'><b>Spitz</b></font>) saw
Francois, swinging an axe, spring into the mess of dogs. Three men
with clubs were helping him (<font color='blue'><b>Spitz</b></font>) to scatter them. It did not take long. Two
minutes from the time Curly went down, the last of her (<font color='blue'><b>wolf</b></font>) assailants were
clubbed off. But she (<font color='blue'><b>wolf</b></font>) lay there limp and lifeless in the bloody, trampled
snow, almost literally torn to pieces, the swart half-breed standing
over her (<font color='blue'><b>wolf</b></font>) and cursing horribly. The scene often came back to Buck to
trouble him (<font color='blue'><b>Buck</b></font>) in his (<font color='blue'><b>Buck</b></font>) sleep. So that was the way. No fair play. Once down,
that was the end of you. Well, he (<font color='blue'><b>Buck</b></font>) would see to it that he (<font color='blue'><b>Buck</b></font>) never went
down. Spitz ran out his (<font color='blue'><b>Spitz</b></font>) tongue and laughed again, and from that moment
Buck hated him (<font color='blue'><b>Buck</b></font>) with a bitter and deathless hatred.

<p/>Before he (<font color='blue'><b>Buck</b></font>) had recovered from the shock caused by the tragic passing
of Curly, he (<font color='blue'><b>Curly</b></font>) received another shock. Francois fastened upon him (<font color='blue'><b>Francois</b></font>) an
arrangement of straps and buckles. It was a harness, such as he (<font color='blue'><b>Francois</b></font>) had seen
the grooms put on the horses at home. And as he (<font color='blue'><b>Francois</b></font>) had seen horses work,
so he (<font color='blue'><b>Francois</b></font>) was set to work, hauling Francois on a sled to the forest that
fringed the valley, and returning with a load of firewood. Though his (<font color='blue'><b>Francois</b></font>)
dignity was sorely hurt by thus being made a draught animal, he (<font color='blue'><b>Francois</b></font>) was too
wise to rebel. He (<font color='blue'><b>Francois</b></font>) buckled down with a will and did his (<font color='blue'><b>Francois</b></font>) best, though
it was all new and strange. Francois was stern, demanding instant
obedience, and by virtue of his (<font color='blue'><b>Francois</b></font>) whip receiving instant obedience;
while Dave, who was an experienced wheeler, nipped Buck's hind quarters
whenever he (<font color='blue'><b>Buck</b></font>) was in error. Spitz was the leader, likewise experienced,
and while he (<font color='blue'><b>Spitz</b></font>) could not always get at Buck, he (<font color='blue'><b>Buck</b></font>) growled sharp reproof now
and again, or cunningly threw his (<font color='blue'><b>Buck</b></font>) weight in the traces to jerk Buck
into the way he (<font color='blue'><b>Buck</b></font>) should go. Buck learned easily, and under the combined
tuition of his (<font color='blue'><b>Buck</b></font>) two mates and Francois made remarkable progress. Ere they
returned to camp he (<font color='blue'><b>Francois</b></font>) knew enough to stop at <div class="bookquote">``ho,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>to go ahead at <div class="bookquote">``mush,''
 (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>to swing wide on the bends, and to keep clear of the wheeler when the
loaded sled shot downhill at their heels.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``T'ree vair' good dogs,''  (<font color='red'><b>Francois</b></font>)</div>Francois told Perrault. <div class="bookquote">``Dat Buck, heem pool
lak hell. I tich heem queek as anyt`ing.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Perrault</b></font>)</div><p/>By afternoon, Perrault, who was in a hurry to be on the trail with his (<font color='blue'><b>Francois</b></font>)
despatches, returned with two more dogs. <div class="bookquote">``Billee''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>and <div class="bookquote">``Joe''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Francois</b></font>) called
them, two brothers, and true huskies both. Sons of the one mother though
they were, they were as different as day and night. Billee's one fault
was his (<font color='blue'><b>Francois</b></font>) excessive good nature, while Joe was the very opposite, sour and
introspective, with a perpetual snarl and a malignant eye. Buck received
them in comradely fashion, Dave ignored them, while Spitz proceeded to
thrash first one and then the other. Billee wagged his (<font color='blue'><b>Spitz</b></font>) tail appeasingly,
turned to run when he (<font color='blue'><b>Spitz</b></font>) saw that appeasement was of no avail, and cried
-LRB-still appeasingly-RRB- when Spitz's sharp teeth scored his (<font color='blue'><b>Spitz</b></font>) flank. But no
matter how Spitz circled, Joe whirled around on his (<font color='blue'><b>Joe</b></font>) heels to face
him (<font color='blue'><b>Joe</b></font>), mane bristling, ears laid back, lips writhing and snarling, jaws
clipping together as fast as he (<font color='blue'><b>Joe</b></font>) could snap, and eyes diabolically
gleaming--the incarnation of belligerent fear. So terrible was his (<font color='blue'><b>Joe</b></font>)
appearance that Spitz was forced to forego disciplining him (<font color='blue'><b>Spitz</b></font>); but to
cover his (<font color='blue'><b>Spitz</b></font>) own discomfiture he (<font color='blue'><b>Spitz</b></font>) turned upon the inoffensive and wailing
Billee and drove him (<font color='blue'><b>Spitz</b></font>) to the confines of the camp.

<p/>By evening Perrault secured another dog, an old husky, long and lean
and gaunt, with a battle-scarred face and a single eye which flashed a
warning of prowess that commanded respect. He (<font color='blue'><b>Perrault</b></font>) was called Sol-leks, which
means the Angry One. Like Dave, he (<font color='blue'><b>Dave</b></font>) asked nothing, gave nothing, expected
nothing; and when he (<font color='blue'><b>Dave</b></font>) marched slowly and deliberately into their midst,
even Spitz left him (<font color='blue'><b>Spitz</b></font>) alone. He (<font color='blue'><b>Spitz</b></font>) had one peculiarity which Buck was unlucky
enough to discover. He (<font color='blue'><b>Buck</b></font>) did not like to be approached on his (<font color='blue'><b>Buck</b></font>) blind side.
Of this offence Buck was unwittingly guilty, and the first knowledge he (<font color='blue'><b>Buck</b></font>)
had of his (<font color='blue'><b>Buck</b></font>) indiscretion was when Sol-leks whirled upon him (<font color='blue'><b>Buck</b></font>) and slashed
his (<font color='blue'><b>Buck</b></font>) shoulder to the bone for three inches up and down. Forever after
Buck avoided his (<font color='blue'><b>Buck</b></font>) blind side, and to the last of their comradeship had
no more trouble. His (<font color='blue'><b>Buck</b></font>) only apparent ambition, like Dave's, was to be left
alone; though, as Buck was afterward to learn, each of them possessed
one other and even more vital ambition.

<p/>That night Buck faced the great problem of sleeping. The tent, illumined
by a candle, glowed warmly in the midst of the white plain; and when he (<font color='blue'><b>Buck</b></font>),
as a matter of course, entered it, both Perrault and Francois bombarded
him (<font color='blue'><b>Perrault</b></font>) with curses and cooking utensils, till he (<font color='blue'><b>Perrault</b></font>) recovered from his (<font color='blue'><b>Perrault</b></font>)
consternation and fled ignominiously into the outer cold. A chill wind
was blowing that nipped him (<font color='blue'><b>Perrault</b></font>) sharply and bit with especial venom into his (<font color='blue'><b>Perrault</b></font>)
wounded shoulder. He (<font color='blue'><b>Perrault</b></font>) lay down on the snow and attempted to sleep,
but the frost soon drove him (<font color='blue'><b>Perrault</b></font>) shivering to his (<font color='blue'><b>Perrault</b></font>) feet. Miserable and
disconsolate, he (<font color='blue'><b>Perrault</b></font>) wandered about among the many tents, only to find that
one place was as cold as another. Here and there savage dogs rushed
upon him (<font color='blue'><b>Perrault</b></font>), but he (<font color='blue'><b>Perrault</b></font>) bristled his (<font color='blue'><b>Perrault</b></font>) neck-hair and snarled -LRB-for he (<font color='blue'><b>Perrault</b></font>) was learning
fast-RRB-, and they let him (<font color='blue'><b>Perrault</b></font>) go his (<font color='blue'><b>Perrault</b></font>) way unmolested.

<p/>Finally an idea came to him (<font color='blue'><b>Perrault</b></font>). He (<font color='blue'><b>Perrault</b></font>) would return and see how his (<font color='blue'><b>Perrault</b></font>) own
team-mates were making out. To his (<font color='blue'><b>Perrault</b></font>) astonishment, they had disappeared.
Again he (<font color='blue'><b>Perrault</b></font>) wandered about through the great camp, looking for them, and
again he (<font color='blue'><b>Perrault</b></font>) returned. Were they in the tent? No, that could not be, else he (<font color='blue'><b>Perrault</b></font>)
would not have been driven out. Then where could they possibly be? With
drooping tail and shivering body, very forlorn indeed, he (<font color='blue'><b>Perrault</b></font>) aimlessly
circled the tent. Suddenly the snow gave way beneath his (<font color='blue'><b>Perrault</b></font>) fore legs
and he (<font color='blue'><b>Perrault</b></font>) sank down. Something wriggled under his (<font color='blue'><b>Perrault</b></font>) feet. He (<font color='blue'><b>Perrault</b></font>) sprang back,
bristling and snarling, fearful of the unseen and unknown. But a
friendly little yelp reassured him (<font color='blue'><b>Perrault</b></font>), and he (<font color='blue'><b>Perrault</b></font>) went back to investigate. A
whiff of warm air ascended to his (<font color='blue'><b>Perrault</b></font>) nostrils, and there, curled up under
the snow in a snug ball, lay Billee. He (<font color='blue'><b>Perrault</b></font>) whined placatingly, squirmed and
wriggled to show his (<font color='blue'><b>Perrault</b></font>) good will and intentions, and even ventured, as a
bribe for peace, to lick Buck's face with his (<font color='blue'><b>Buck</b></font>) warm wet tongue.

<p/>Another lesson. So that was the way they did it, eh? Buck confidently
selected a spot, and with much fuss and waste effort proceeded to dig a
hole for himself. In a trice the heat from his (<font color='blue'><b>Buck</b></font>) body filled the confined
space and he (<font color='blue'><b>Buck</b></font>) was asleep. The day had been long and arduous, and he (<font color='blue'><b>Buck</b></font>) slept
soundly and comfortably, though he (<font color='blue'><b>Buck</b></font>) growled and barked and wrestled with
bad dreams.

<p/>Nor did he (<font color='blue'><b>Buck</b></font>) open his (<font color='blue'><b>Buck</b></font>) eyes till roused by the noises of the waking camp.
At first he (<font color='blue'><b>Buck</b></font>) did not know where he (<font color='blue'><b>Buck</b></font>) was. It had snowed during the night
and he (<font color='blue'><b>Buck</b></font>) was completely buried. The snow walls pressed him (<font color='blue'><b>Buck</b></font>) on every side,
and a great surge of fear swept through him (<font color='blue'><b>Buck</b></font>)--the fear of the wild thing
for the trap. It was a token that he (<font color='blue'><b>Buck</b></font>) was harking back through his (<font color='blue'><b>Buck</b></font>) own
life to the lives of his (<font color='blue'><b>Buck</b></font>) forebears; for he (<font color='blue'><b>Buck</b></font>) was a civilized dog, an
unduly civilized dog, and of his (<font color='blue'><b>Buck</b></font>) own experience knew no trap and so
could not of himself fear it. The muscles of his (<font color='blue'><b>Buck</b></font>) whole body contracted
spasmodically and instinctively, the hair on his (<font color='blue'><b>Buck</b></font>) neck and shoulders
stood on end, and with a ferocious snarl he (<font color='blue'><b>Buck</b></font>) bounded straight up into
the blinding day, the snow flying about him (<font color='blue'><b>Buck</b></font>) in a flashing cloud. Ere he (<font color='blue'><b>Buck</b></font>)
landed on his (<font color='blue'><b>Buck</b></font>) feet, he (<font color='blue'><b>Buck</b></font>) saw the white camp spread out before him (<font color='blue'><b>Buck</b></font>) and knew
where he (<font color='blue'><b>Buck</b></font>) was and remembered all that had passed from the time he (<font color='blue'><b>Buck</b></font>) went
for a stroll with Manuel to the hole he (<font color='blue'><b>Manuel</b></font>) had dug for himself the night
before.

<p/>A shout from Francois hailed his (<font color='blue'><b>Francois</b></font>) appearance. <div class="bookquote">``Wot I say?''  (<font color='red'><b>Perrault</b></font>)</div>the dog-driver
cried to Perrault. <div class="bookquote">``Dat Buck for sure learn queek as anyt`ing.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Perrault</b></font>)</div><p/>Perrault nodded gravely. As courier for the Canadian Government, bearing
important despatches, he (<font color='blue'><b>Perrault</b></font>) was anxious to secure the best dogs, and he (<font color='blue'><b>Perrault</b></font>) was
particularly gladdened by the possession of Buck.

<p/>Three more huskies were added to the team inside an hour, making a total
of nine, and before another quarter of an hour had passed they were in
harness and swinging up the trail toward the Dyea Canon. Buck was
glad to be gone, and though the work was hard he (<font color='blue'><b>Buck</b></font>) found he (<font color='blue'><b>Buck</b></font>) did not
particularly despise it. He (<font color='blue'><b>Buck</b></font>) was surprised at the eagerness which
animated the whole team and which was communicated to him (<font color='blue'><b>Buck</b></font>); but still
more surprising was the change wrought in Dave and Sol-leks. They
were new dogs, utterly transformed by the harness. All passiveness and
unconcern had dropped from them. They were alert and active, anxious
that the work should go well, and fiercely irritable with whatever, by
delay or confusion, retarded that work. The toil of the traces seemed
the supreme expression of their being, and all that they lived for and
the only thing in which they took delight.

<p/>Dave was wheeler or sled dog, pulling in front of him (<font color='blue'><b>Dave</b></font>) was Buck, then
came Sol-leks; the rest of the team was strung out ahead, single file,
to the leader, which position was filled by Spitz.

<p/>Buck had been purposely placed between Dave and Sol-leks so that he (<font color='blue'><b>Buck</b></font>)
might receive instruction. Apt scholar that he (<font color='blue'><b>scholar</b></font>) was, they were equally
apt teachers, never allowing him (<font color='blue'><b>scholar</b></font>) to linger long in error, and enforcing
their teaching with their sharp teeth. Dave was fair and very wise. He (<font color='blue'><b>Dave</b></font>)
never nipped Buck without cause, and he (<font color='blue'><b>Buck</b></font>) never failed to nip him (<font color='blue'><b>Buck</b></font>) when he (<font color='blue'><b>Buck</b></font>)
stood in need of it. As Francois's whip backed him (<font color='blue'><b>Francois</b></font>) up, Buck found it
to be cheaper to mend his (<font color='blue'><b>Buck</b></font>) ways than to retaliate. Once, during a brief
halt, when he (<font color='blue'><b>Buck</b></font>) got tangled in the traces and delayed the start, both
Dave and Solleks flew at him (<font color='blue'><b>Dave</b></font>) and administered a sound trouncing. The
resulting tangle was even worse, but Buck took good care to keep the
traces clear thereafter; and ere the day was done, so well had he (<font color='blue'><b>Buck</b></font>)
mastered his (<font color='blue'><b>Buck</b></font>) work, his (<font color='blue'><b>Buck</b></font>) mates about ceased nagging him (<font color='blue'><b>Buck</b></font>). Francois's whip
snapped less frequently, and Perrault even honored Buck by lifting up
his (<font color='blue'><b>Buck</b></font>) feet and carefully examining them.

<p/>It was a hard day's run, up the Canon, through Sheep Camp, past the
Scales and the timber line, across glaciers and snowdrifts hundreds of
feet deep, and over the great Chilcoot Divide, which stands between
the salt water and the fresh and guards forbiddingly the sad and lonely
North. They made good time down the chain of lakes which fills the
craters of extinct volcanoes, and late that night pulled into the huge
camp at the head of Lake Bennett, where thousands of goldseekers were
building boats against the break-up of the ice in the spring. Buck made
his (<font color='blue'><b>Buck</b></font>) hole in the snow and slept the sleep of the exhausted just, but all
too early was routed out in the cold darkness and harnessed with his (<font color='blue'><b>Buck</b></font>)
mates to the sled.

<p/>That day they made forty miles, the trail being packed; but the next
day, and for many days to follow, they broke their own trail, worked
harder, and made poorer time. As a rule, Perrault travelled ahead of
the team, packing the snow with webbed shoes to make it easier for them.
Francois, guiding the sled at the gee-pole, sometimes exchanged places
with him (<font color='blue'><b>Francois</b></font>), but not often. Perrault was in a hurry, and he (<font color='blue'><b>Perrault</b></font>) prided himself
on his (<font color='blue'><b>Perrault</b></font>) knowledge of ice, which knowledge was indispensable, for the fall
ice was very thin, and where there was swift water, there was no ice at
all.

<p/>Day after day, for days unending, Buck toiled in the traces. Always,
they broke camp in the dark, and the first gray of dawn found them
hitting the trail with fresh miles reeled off behind them. And always
they pitched camp after dark, eating their bit of fish, and crawling
to sleep into the snow. Buck was ravenous. The pound and a half of
sun-dried salmon, which was his (<font color='blue'><b>Buck</b></font>) ration for each day, seemed to go
nowhere. He (<font color='blue'><b>Buck</b></font>) never had enough, and suffered from perpetual hunger pangs.
Yet the other dogs, because they weighed less and were born to the life,
received a pound only of the fish and managed to keep in good condition.

<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Buck</b></font>) swiftly lost the fastidiousness which had characterized his (<font color='blue'><b>Buck</b></font>) old life.
A dainty eater, he (<font color='blue'><b>Buck</b></font>) found that his (<font color='blue'><b>Buck</b></font>) mates, finishing first, robbed him (<font color='blue'><b>Buck</b></font>) of
his (<font color='blue'><b>Buck</b></font>) unfinished ration. There was no defending it. While he (<font color='blue'><b>Buck</b></font>) was fighting
off two or three, it was disappearing down the throats of the others. To
remedy this, he (<font color='blue'><b>Buck</b></font>) ate as fast as they; and, so greatly did hunger compel
him (<font color='blue'><b>Buck</b></font>), he (<font color='blue'><b>Buck</b></font>) was not above taking what did not belong to him (<font color='blue'><b>Buck</b></font>). He (<font color='blue'><b>Buck</b></font>) watched and
learned. When he (<font color='blue'><b>Buck</b></font>) saw Pike, one of the new dogs, a clever malingerer and
thief, slyly steal a slice of bacon when Perrault's back was turned,
he (<font color='blue'><b>Perrault</b></font>) duplicated the performance the following day, getting away with the
whole chunk. A great uproar was raised, but he (<font color='blue'><b>Perrault</b></font>) was unsuspected; while
Dub, an awkward blunderer who was always getting caught, was punished
for Buck's misdeed.

<p/>This first theft marked Buck as fit to survive in the hostile Northland
environment. It marked his (<font color='blue'><b>Buck</b></font>) adaptability, his (<font color='blue'><b>Buck</b></font>) capacity to adjust himself
to changing conditions, the lack of which would have meant swift and
terrible death. It marked, further, the decay or going to pieces of his (<font color='blue'><b>Buck</b></font>)
moral nature, a vain thing and a handicap in the ruthless struggle for
existence. It was all well enough in the Southland, under the law of
love and fellowship, to respect private property and personal feelings;
but in the Northland, under the law of club and fang, whoso took such
things into account was a fool, and in so far as he (<font color='blue'><b>fool</b></font>) observed them he (<font color='blue'><b>fool</b></font>)
would fail to prosper.

<p/>Not that Buck reasoned it out. He (<font color='blue'><b>Buck</b></font>) was fit, that was all, and
unconsciously he (<font color='blue'><b>Buck</b></font>) accommodated himself to the new mode of life. All his (<font color='blue'><b>Buck</b></font>)
days, no matter what the odds, he (<font color='blue'><b>Buck</b></font>) had never run from a fight. But
the club of the man in the red sweater had beaten into him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) a more
fundamental and primitive code. Civilized, he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) could have died for a
moral consideration, say the defence of Judge Miller's riding-whip; but
the completeness of his (<font color='blue'><b>Miller</b></font>) decivilization was now evidenced by his (<font color='blue'><b>Miller</b></font>) ability
to flee from the defence of a moral consideration and so save his (<font color='blue'><b>Miller</b></font>)
hide. He (<font color='blue'><b>Miller</b></font>) did not steal for joy of it, but because of the clamor of his (<font color='blue'><b>Miller</b></font>)
stomach. He (<font color='blue'><b>Miller</b></font>) did not rob openly, but stole secretly and cunningly, out of
respect for club and fang. In short, the things he (<font color='blue'><b>Miller</b></font>) did were done because
it was easier to do them than not to do them.

<p/>His (<font color='blue'><b>Miller</b></font>) development -LRB-or retrogression-RRB- was rapid. His (<font color='blue'><b>Miller</b></font>) muscles became hard as
iron, and he (<font color='blue'><b>Miller</b></font>) grew callous to all ordinary pain. He (<font color='blue'><b>Miller</b></font>) achieved an internal
as well as external economy. He (<font color='blue'><b>Miller</b></font>) could eat anything, no matter how
loathsome or indigestible; and, once eaten, the juices of his (<font color='blue'><b>Miller</b></font>) stomach
extracted the last least particle of nutriment; and his (<font color='blue'><b>Miller</b></font>) blood carried it
to the farthest reaches of his (<font color='blue'><b>Miller</b></font>) body, building it into the toughest and
stoutest of tissues. Sight and scent became remarkably keen, while his (<font color='blue'><b>Miller</b></font>)
hearing developed such acuteness that in his (<font color='blue'><b>Miller</b></font>) sleep he (<font color='blue'><b>Miller</b></font>) heard the faintest
sound and knew whether it heralded peace or peril. He (<font color='blue'><b>Miller</b></font>) learned to bite
the ice out with his (<font color='blue'><b>Miller</b></font>) teeth when it collected between his (<font color='blue'><b>Miller</b></font>) toes; and when
he (<font color='blue'><b>Miller</b></font>) was thirsty and there was a thick scum of ice over the water hole, he (<font color='blue'><b>Miller</b></font>)
would break it by rearing and striking it with stiff fore legs. His (<font color='blue'><b>Miller</b></font>) most
conspicuous trait was an ability to scent the wind and forecast it a
night in advance. No matter how breathless the air when he (<font color='blue'><b>Miller</b></font>) dug his (<font color='blue'><b>Miller</b></font>)
nest by tree or bank, the wind that later blew inevitably found him (<font color='blue'><b>Miller</b></font>) to
leeward, sheltered and snug.

<p/>And not only did he (<font color='blue'><b>Miller</b></font>) learn by experience, but instincts long dead became
alive again. The domesticated generations fell from him (<font color='blue'><b>Miller</b></font>). In vague ways
he (<font color='blue'><b>Miller</b></font>) remembered back to the youth of the breed, to the time the wild dogs
ranged in packs through the primeval forest and killed their meat as
they ran it down. It was no task for him (<font color='blue'><b>Miller</b></font>) to learn to fight with cut
and slash and the quick wolf snap. In this manner had fought forgotten
ancestors. They quickened the old life within him (<font color='blue'><b>Miller</b></font>), and the old tricks
which they had stamped into the heredity of the breed were his (<font color='blue'><b>Miller</b></font>) tricks.
They came to him (<font color='blue'><b>Miller</b></font>) without effort or discovery, as though they had been
his (<font color='blue'><b>Miller</b></font>) always. And when, on the still cold nights, he (<font color='blue'><b>Miller</b></font>) pointed his (<font color='blue'><b>Miller</b></font>) nose at a
star and howled long and wolflike, it was his (<font color='blue'><b>Miller</b></font>) ancestors, dead and dust,
pointing nose at star and howling down through the centuries and through
him (<font color='blue'><b>Miller</b></font>). And his (<font color='blue'><b>Miller</b></font>) cadences were their cadences, the cadences which voiced
their woe and what to them was the meaning of the stiffness, and the
cold, and dark.

<p/>Thus, as token of what a puppet thing life is, the ancient song surged
through him (<font color='blue'><b>Miller</b></font>) and he (<font color='blue'><b>Miller</b></font>) came into his (<font color='blue'><b>Miller</b></font>) own again; and he (<font color='blue'><b>Miller</b></font>) came because men had
found a yellow metal in the North, and because Manuel was a gardener's
helper whose wages did not lap over the needs of his (<font color='blue'><b>Manuel</b></font>) wife and divers
small copies of himself.




<p/>Chapter III. The Dominant Primordial Beast


<p/>The dominant primordial beast was strong in Buck, and under the fierce
conditions of trail life it grew and grew. Yet it was a secret growth.
His (<font color='blue'><b>Buck</b></font>) newborn cunning gave him (<font color='blue'><b>Buck</b></font>) poise and control. He (<font color='blue'><b>Buck</b></font>) was too busy
adjusting himself to the new life to feel at ease, and not only did
he (<font color='blue'><b>Buck</b></font>) not pick fights, but he (<font color='blue'><b>Buck</b></font>) avoided them whenever possible. A certain
deliberateness characterized his (<font color='blue'><b>Buck</b></font>) attitude. He (<font color='blue'><b>Buck</b></font>) was not prone to rashness
and precipitate action; and in the bitter hatred between him (<font color='blue'><b>Buck</b></font>) and Spitz
he (<font color='blue'><b>Spitz</b></font>) betrayed no impatience, shunned all offensive acts.

<p/>On the other hand, possibly because he (<font color='blue'><b>Spitz</b></font>) divined in Buck a dangerous
rival, Spitz never lost an opportunity of showing his (<font color='blue'><b>Spitz</b></font>) teeth. He (<font color='blue'><b>Spitz</b></font>) even
went out of his (<font color='blue'><b>Spitz</b></font>) way to bully Buck, striving constantly to start the
fight which could end only in the death of one or the other. Early in
the trip this might have taken place had it not been for an unwonted
accident. At the end of this day they made a bleak and miserable camp
on the shore of Lake Le Barge. Driving snow, a wind that cut like a
white-hot knife, and darkness had forced them to grope for a camping
place. They could hardly have fared worse. At their backs rose a
perpendicular wall of rock, and Perrault and Francois were compelled to
make their fire and spread their sleeping robes on the ice of the lake
itself. The tent they had discarded at Dyea in order to travel light.
A few sticks of driftwood furnished them with a fire that thawed down
through the ice and left them to eat supper in the dark.

<p/>Close in under the sheltering rock Buck made his (<font color='blue'><b>Buck</b></font>) nest. So snug and warm
was it, that he (<font color='blue'><b>Buck</b></font>) was loath to leave it when Francois distributed the
fish which he (<font color='blue'><b>Francois</b></font>) had first thawed over the fire. But when Buck finished his (<font color='blue'><b>Buck</b></font>)
ration and returned, he (<font color='blue'><b>Buck</b></font>) found his (<font color='blue'><b>Buck</b></font>) nest occupied. A warning snarl told
him (<font color='blue'><b>Buck</b></font>) that the trespasser was Spitz. Till now Buck had avoided trouble
with his (<font color='blue'><b>Buck</b></font>) enemy, but this was too much. The beast in him (<font color='blue'><b>Buck</b></font>) roared. He (<font color='blue'><b>Buck</b></font>)
sprang upon Spitz with a fury which surprised them both, and Spitz
particularly, for his (<font color='blue'><b>Spitz</b></font>) whole experience with Buck had gone to teach him (<font color='blue'><b>Buck</b></font>)
that his (<font color='blue'><b>Buck</b></font>) rival was an unusually timid dog, who managed to hold his (<font color='blue'><b>Buck</b></font>) own
only because of his (<font color='blue'><b>Buck</b></font>) great weight and size.

<p/>Francois was surprised, too, when they shot out in a tangle from the
disrupted nest and he (<font color='blue'><b>Francois</b></font>) divined the cause of the trouble. <div class="bookquote">``A-a-ah!''
 (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Francois</b></font>) cried to Buck. <div class="bookquote">``Gif it to heem, by Gar! Gif it to heem, the dirty
t`eef!''

 (<font color='red'><b>Spitz</b></font>)</div><p/>Spitz was equally willing. He (<font color='blue'><b>Spitz</b></font>) was crying with sheer rage and eagerness
as he (<font color='blue'><b>Spitz</b></font>) circled back and forth for a chance to spring in. Buck was no less
eager, and no less cautious, as he (<font color='blue'><b>Buck</b></font>) likewise circled back and forth for
the advantage. But it was then that the unexpected happened, the thing
which projected their struggle for supremacy far into the future, past
many a weary mile of trail and toil.

<p/>An oath from Perrault, the resounding impact of a club upon a bony
frame, and a shrill yelp of pain, heralded the breaking forth of
pandemonium. The camp was suddenly discovered to be alive with skulking
furry forms,--starving huskies, four or five score of them, who had
scented the camp from some Indian village. They had crept in while Buck
and Spitz were fighting, and when the two men sprang among them with
stout clubs they showed their teeth and fought back. They were crazed
by the smell of the food. Perrault found one with head buried in the
grub-box. His (<font color='blue'><b>Perrault</b></font>) club landed heavily on the gaunt ribs, and the grub-box
was capsized on the ground. On the instant a score of the famished
brutes were scrambling for the bread and bacon. The clubs fell upon them
unheeded. They yelped and howled under the rain of blows, but struggled
none the less madly till the last crumb had been devoured.

<p/>In the meantime the astonished team-dogs had burst out of their nests
only to be set upon by the fierce invaders. Never had Buck seen such
dogs. It seemed as though their bones would burst through their skins.
They were mere skeletons, draped loosely in draggled hides, with blazing
eyes and slavered fangs. But the hunger-madness made them terrifying,
irresistible. There was no opposing them. The team-dogs were swept back
against the cliff at the first onset. Buck was beset by three huskies,
and in a trice his (<font color='blue'><b>Buck</b></font>) head and shoulders were ripped and slashed. The din
was frightful. Billee was crying as usual. Dave and Sol-leks, dripping
blood from a score of wounds, were fighting bravely side by side. Joe
was snapping like a demon. Once, his (<font color='blue'><b>Joe</b></font>) teeth closed on the fore leg of
a husky, and he (<font color='blue'><b>Joe</b></font>) crunched down through the bone. Pike, the malingerer,
leaped upon the crippled animal, breaking its neck with a quick flash of
teeth and a jerk, Buck got a frothing adversary by the throat, and was
sprayed with blood when his (<font color='blue'><b>Buck</b></font>) teeth sank through the jugular. The warm
taste of it in his (<font color='blue'><b>Buck</b></font>) mouth goaded him (<font color='blue'><b>Buck</b></font>) to greater fierceness. He (<font color='blue'><b>Buck</b></font>) flung
himself upon another, and at the same time felt teeth sink into his (<font color='blue'><b>Buck</b></font>) own
throat. It was Spitz, treacherously attacking from the side.

<p/>Perrault and Francois, having cleaned out their part of the camp,
hurried to save their sled-dogs. The wild wave of famished beasts rolled
back before them, and Buck shook himself free. But it was only for a
moment. The two men were compelled to run back to save the grub, upon
which the huskies returned to the attack on the team. Billee, terrified
into bravery, sprang through the savage circle and fled away over the
ice. Pike and Dub followed on his (<font color='blue'><b>Buck</b></font>) heels, with the rest of the team
behind. As Buck drew himself together to spring after them, out of the
tail of his (<font color='blue'><b>Buck</b></font>) eye he (<font color='blue'><b>Buck</b></font>) saw Spitz rush upon him (<font color='blue'><b>Buck</b></font>) with the evident intention
of overthrowing him (<font color='blue'><b>Buck</b></font>). Once off his (<font color='blue'><b>Buck</b></font>) feet and under that mass of huskies,
there was no hope for him (<font color='blue'><b>Buck</b></font>). But he (<font color='blue'><b>Buck</b></font>) braced himself to the shock of Spitz's
charge, then joined the flight out on the lake.

<p/>Later, the nine team-dogs gathered together and sought shelter in the
forest. Though unpursued, they were in a sorry plight. There was not
one who was not wounded in four or five places, while some were wounded
grievously. Dub was badly injured in a hind leg; Dolly, the last husky
added to the team at Dyea, had a badly torn throat; Joe had lost an eye;
while Billee, the good-natured, with an ear chewed and rent to ribbons,
cried and whimpered throughout the night. At daybreak they limped warily
back to camp, to find the marauders gone and the two men in bad tempers.
Fully half their grub supply was gone. The huskies had chewed through
the sled lashings and canvas coverings. In fact, nothing, no matter how
remotely eatable, had escaped them. They had eaten a pair of Perrault's
moose-hide moccasins, chunks out of the leather traces, and even two
feet of lash from the end of Francois's whip. He (<font color='blue'><b>Francois</b></font>) broke from a mournful
contemplation of it to look over his (<font color='blue'><b>Francois</b></font>) wounded dogs.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Ah, my frien's,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Francois</b></font>) said softly, <div class="bookquote">``mebbe it mek you mad dog, dose many
bites. Mebbe all mad dog, sacredam! Wot you t`ink, eh, Perrault?''

 (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div><p/>The courier shook his (<font color='blue'><b>Francois</b></font>) head dubiously. With four hundred miles of trail
still between him (<font color='blue'><b>Francois</b></font>) and Dawson, he (<font color='blue'><b>Dawson</b></font>) could ill afford to have madness break
out among his (<font color='blue'><b>Dawson</b></font>) dogs. Two hours of cursing and exertion got the harnesses
into shape, and the wound-stiffened team was under way, struggling
painfully over the hardest part of the trail they had yet encountered,
and for that matter, the hardest between them and Dawson.

<p/>The Thirty Mile River was wide open. Its wild water defied the frost,
and it was in the eddies only and in the quiet places that the ice held
at all. Six days of exhausting toil were required to cover those thirty
terrible miles. And terrible they were, for every foot of them was
accomplished at the risk of life to dog and man. A dozen times,
Perrault, nosing the way broke through the ice bridges, being saved by
the long pole he (<font color='blue'><b>Perrault</b></font>) carried, which he (<font color='blue'><b>Perrault</b></font>) so held that it fell each time across
the hole made by his (<font color='blue'><b>Perrault</b></font>) body. But a cold snap was on, the thermometer
registering fifty below zero, and each time he (<font color='blue'><b>Perrault</b></font>) broke through he (<font color='blue'><b>Perrault</b></font>) was
compelled for very life to build a fire and dry his (<font color='blue'><b>Perrault</b></font>) garments.

<p/>Nothing daunted him (<font color='blue'><b>Perrault</b></font>). It was because nothing daunted him (<font color='blue'><b>Perrault</b></font>) that he (<font color='blue'><b>Perrault</b></font>) had been
chosen for government courier. He (<font color='blue'><b>Perrault</b></font>) took all manner of risks, resolutely
thrusting his (<font color='blue'><b>Perrault</b></font>) little weazened face into the frost and struggling on from
dim dawn to dark. He (<font color='blue'><b>Perrault</b></font>) skirted the frowning shores on rim ice that bent
and crackled under foot and upon which they dared not halt. Once, the
sled broke through, with Dave and Buck, and they were half-frozen and
all but drowned by the time they were dragged out. The usual fire was
necessary to save them. They were coated solidly with ice, and the two
men kept them on the run around the fire, sweating and thawing, so close
that they were singed by the flames.

<p/>At another time Spitz went through, dragging the whole team after him (<font color='blue'><b>Spitz</b></font>) up
to Buck, who strained backward with all his (<font color='blue'><b>Spitz</b></font>) strength, his (<font color='blue'><b>Spitz</b></font>) fore paws on
the slippery edge and the ice quivering and snapping all around. But
behind him (<font color='blue'><b>Spitz</b></font>) was Dave, likewise straining backward, and behind the sled
was Francois, pulling till his (<font color='blue'><b>Francois</b></font>) tendons cracked.

<p/>Again, the rim ice broke away before and behind, and there was no escape
except up the cliff. Perrault scaled it by a miracle, while Francois
prayed for just that miracle; and with every thong and sled lashing and
the last bit of harness rove into a long rope, the dogs were hoisted,
one by one, to the cliff crest. Francois came up last, after the sled
and load. Then came the search for a place to descend, which descent was
ultimately made by the aid of the rope, and night found them back on the
river with a quarter of a mile to the day's credit.

<p/>By the time they made the Hootalinqua and good ice, Buck was played out.
The rest of the dogs were in like condition; but Perrault, to make
up lost time, pushed them late and early. The first day they covered
thirty-five miles to the Big Salmon; the next day thirty-five more to
the Little Salmon; the third day forty miles, which brought them well up
toward the Five Fingers.

<p/>Buck's feet were not so compact and hard as the feet of the huskies.
His (<font color='blue'><b>Buck</b></font>) had softened during the many generations since the day his (<font color='blue'><b>Buck</b></font>) last
wild ancestor was tamed by a cave-dweller or river man. All day long he (<font color='blue'><b>Buck</b></font>)
limped in agony, and camp once made, lay down like a dead dog. Hungry as
he (<font color='blue'><b>Buck</b></font>) was, he (<font color='blue'><b>Buck</b></font>) would not move to receive his (<font color='blue'><b>Buck</b></font>) ration of fish, which Francois
had to bring to him (<font color='blue'><b>Francois</b></font>). Also, the dog-driver rubbed Buck's feet for half
an hour each night after supper, and sacrificed the tops of his (<font color='blue'><b>Buck</b></font>) own
moccasins to make four moccasins for Buck. This was a great relief, and
Buck caused even the weazened face of Perrault to twist itself into a
grin one morning, when Francois forgot the moccasins and Buck lay on his (<font color='blue'><b>Buck</b></font>)
back, his (<font color='blue'><b>Buck</b></font>) four feet waving appealingly in the air, and refused to budge
without them. Later his (<font color='blue'><b>Buck</b></font>) feet grew hard to the trail, and the worn-out
foot-gear was thrown away.

<p/>At the Pelly one morning, as they were harnessing up, Dolly, who had
never been conspicuous for anything, went suddenly mad. She (<font color='blue'><b>Dolly</b></font>) announced
her (<font color='blue'><b>Dolly</b></font>) condition by a long, heartbreaking wolf howl that sent every dog
bristling with fear, then sprang straight for Buck. He (<font color='blue'><b>Buck</b></font>) had never seen a
dog go mad, nor did he (<font color='blue'><b>Buck</b></font>) have any reason to fear madness; yet he (<font color='blue'><b>Buck</b></font>) knew
that here was horror, and fled away from it in a panic. Straight away he (<font color='blue'><b>Buck</b></font>)
raced, with Dolly, panting and frothing, one leap behind; nor could she (<font color='blue'><b>Dolly</b></font>)
gain on him (<font color='blue'><b>Buck</b></font>), so great was his (<font color='blue'><b>Buck</b></font>) terror, nor could he (<font color='blue'><b>Buck</b></font>) leave her (<font color='blue'><b>Dolly</b></font>), so great
was her (<font color='blue'><b>Dolly</b></font>) madness. He (<font color='blue'><b>Buck</b></font>) plunged through the wooded breast of the island,
flew down to the lower end, crossed a back channel filled with rough ice
to another island, gained a third island, curved back to the main river,
and in desperation started to cross it. And all the time, though he (<font color='blue'><b>Buck</b></font>)
did not look, he (<font color='blue'><b>Buck</b></font>) could hear her (<font color='blue'><b>Dolly</b></font>) snarling just one leap behind. Francois
called to him (<font color='blue'><b>Francois</b></font>) a quarter of a mile away and he (<font color='blue'><b>Francois</b></font>) doubled back, still one
leap ahead, gasping painfully for air and putting all his (<font color='blue'><b>Francois</b></font>) faith in that
Francois would save him (<font color='blue'><b>Francois</b></font>). The dog-driver held the axe poised in his (<font color='blue'><b>Francois</b></font>) hand,
and as Buck shot past him (<font color='blue'><b>Buck</b></font>) the axe crashed down upon mad Dolly's head.

<p/>Buck staggered over against the sled, exhausted, sobbing for breath,
helpless. This was Spitz's opportunity. He (<font color='blue'><b>Buck</b></font>) sprang upon Buck, and twice
his (<font color='blue'><b>Buck</b></font>) teeth sank into his (<font color='blue'><b>Buck</b></font>) unresisting foe and ripped and tore the flesh to
the bone. Then Francois's lash descended, and Buck had the satisfaction
of watching Spitz receive the worst whipping as yet administered to any
of the teams.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``One devil, dat Spitz,''  (<font color='red'><b>Perrault</b></font>)</div>remarked Perrault. <div class="bookquote">``Some dam day heem keel dat
Buck.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Dat Buck two devils,''  (<font color='red'><b>Francois</b></font>)</div>was Francois's rejoinder. <div class="bookquote">``All de tam I watch dat
Buck I know for sure. Lissen: some dam fine day heem get mad lak hell
an' den heem chew dat Spitz all up an' spit heem out on de snow. Sure. I
know.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/>From then on it was war between them. Spitz, as lead-dog and
acknowledged master of the team, felt his (<font color='blue'><b>Spitz</b></font>) supremacy threatened by this
strange Southland dog. And strange Buck was to him (<font color='blue'><b>Buck</b></font>), for of the many
Southland dogs he (<font color='blue'><b>Buck</b></font>) had known, not one had shown up worthily in camp and
on trail. They were all too soft, dying under the toil, the frost, and
starvation. Buck was the exception. He (<font color='blue'><b>Buck</b></font>) alone endured and prospered,
matching the husky in strength, savagery, and cunning. Then he (<font color='blue'><b>Buck</b></font>) was a
masterful dog, and what made him (<font color='blue'><b>Buck</b></font>) dangerous was the fact that the club of
the man in the red sweater had knocked all blind pluck and rashness out
of his (<font color='blue'><b>Buck</b></font>) desire for mastery. He (<font color='blue'><b>Buck</b></font>) was preeminently cunning, and could bide
his (<font color='blue'><b>Buck</b></font>) time with a patience that was nothing less than primitive.

<p/>It was inevitable that the clash for leadership should come. Buck wanted
it. He (<font color='blue'><b>Buck</b></font>) wanted it because it was his (<font color='blue'><b>Buck</b></font>) nature, because he (<font color='blue'><b>Buck</b></font>) had been
gripped tight by that nameless, incomprehensible pride of the trail and
trace--that pride which holds dogs in the toil to the last gasp, which
lures them to die joyfully in the harness, and breaks their hearts
if they are cut out of the harness. This was the pride of Dave as
wheel-dog, of Sol-leks as he (<font color='blue'><b>Dave</b></font>) pulled with all his (<font color='blue'><b>Dave</b></font>) strength; the pride
that laid hold of them at break of camp, transforming them from sour and
sullen brutes into straining, eager, ambitious creatures; the pride
that spurred them on all day and dropped them at pitch of camp at night,
letting them fall back into gloomy unrest and uncontent. This was the
pride that bore up Spitz and made him (<font color='blue'><b>Spitz</b></font>) thrash the sled-dogs who blundered
and shirked in the traces or hid away at harness-up time in the morning.
Likewise it was this pride that made him (<font color='blue'><b>Spitz</b></font>) fear Buck as a possible
lead-dog. And this was Buck's pride, too.

<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Buck</b></font>) openly threatened the other's leadership. He (<font color='blue'><b>Buck</b></font>) came between him (<font color='blue'><b>Buck</b></font>) and the
shirks he (<font color='blue'><b>Buck</b></font>) should have punished. And he (<font color='blue'><b>Buck</b></font>) did it deliberately. One night
there was a heavy snowfall, and in the morning Pike, the malingerer,
did not appear. He (<font color='blue'><b>Buck</b></font>) was securely hidden in his (<font color='blue'><b>Buck</b></font>) nest under a foot of snow.
Francois called him (<font color='blue'><b>Francois</b></font>) and sought him (<font color='blue'><b>Francois</b></font>) in vain. Spitz was wild with wrath.
He (<font color='blue'><b>Spitz</b></font>) raged through the camp, smelling and digging in every likely
place, snarling so frightfully that Pike heard and shivered in his (<font color='blue'><b>Spitz</b></font>)
hiding-place.

<p/>But when he (<font color='blue'><b>Spitz</b></font>) was at last unearthed, and Spitz flew at him (<font color='blue'><b>Spitz</b></font>) to punish him (<font color='blue'><b>Spitz</b></font>),
Buck flew, with equal rage, in between. So unexpected was it, and so
shrewdly managed, that Spitz was hurled backward and off his (<font color='blue'><b>Spitz</b></font>) feet. Pike,
who had been trembling abjectly, took heart at this open mutiny,
and sprang upon his (<font color='blue'><b>Spitz</b></font>) overthrown leader. Buck, to whom fair play was a
forgotten code, likewise sprang upon Spitz. But Francois, chuckling at
the incident while unswerving in the administration of justice, brought
his (<font color='blue'><b>Spitz</b></font>) lash down upon Buck with all his (<font color='blue'><b>Buck</b></font>) might. This failed to drive Buck
from his (<font color='blue'><b>Buck</b></font>) prostrate rival, and the butt of the whip was brought into
play. Half-stunned by the blow, Buck was knocked backward and the lash
laid upon him (<font color='blue'><b>Buck</b></font>) again and again, while Spitz soundly punished the many
times offending Pike.

<p/>In the days that followed, as Dawson grew closer and closer, Buck still
continued to interfere between Spitz and the culprits; but he (<font color='blue'><b>Buck</b></font>) did it
craftily, when Francois was not around, With the covert mutiny of Buck,
a general insubordination sprang up and increased. Dave and Sol-leks
were unaffected, but the rest of the team went from bad to worse.
Things no longer went right. There was continual bickering and jangling.
Trouble was always afoot, and at the bottom of it was Buck. He (<font color='blue'><b>Buck</b></font>) kept
Francois busy, for the dog-driver was in constant apprehension of the
life-and-death struggle between the two which he (<font color='blue'><b>Francois</b></font>) knew must take place
sooner or later; and on more than one night the sounds of quarrelling
and strife among the other dogs turned him (<font color='blue'><b>Francois</b></font>) out of his (<font color='blue'><b>Francois</b></font>) sleeping robe,
fearful that Buck and Spitz were at it.

<p/>But the opportunity did not present itself, and they pulled into Dawson
one dreary afternoon with the great fight still to come. Here were many
men, and countless dogs, and Buck found them all at work. It seemed the
ordained order of things that dogs should work. All day they swung up
and down the main street in long teams, and in the night their jingling
bells still went by. They hauled cabin logs and firewood, freighted up
to the mines, and did all manner of work that horses did in the Santa
Clara Valley. Here and there Buck met Southland dogs, but in the main
they were the wild wolf husky breed. Every night, regularly, at nine, at
twelve, at three, they lifted a nocturnal song, a weird and eerie chant,
in which it was Buck's delight to join.

<p/>With the aurora borealis flaming coldly overhead, or the stars leaping
in the frost dance, and the land numb and frozen under its pall of snow,
this song of the huskies might have been the defiance of life, only it
was pitched in minor key, with long-drawn wailings and half-sobs, and
was more the pleading of life, the articulate travail of existence. It
was an old song, old as the breed itself--one of the first songs of the
younger world in a day when songs were sad. It was invested with the woe
of unnumbered generations, this plaint by which Buck was so strangely
stirred. When he (<font color='blue'><b>Buck</b></font>) moaned and sobbed, it was with the pain of living that
was of old the pain of his (<font color='blue'><b>Buck</b></font>) wild fathers, and the fear and mystery of the
cold and dark that was to them fear and mystery. And that he (<font color='blue'><b>Buck</b></font>) should be
stirred by it marked the completeness with which he (<font color='blue'><b>Buck</b></font>) harked back through
the ages of fire and roof to the raw beginnings of life in the howling
ages.

<p/>Seven days from the time they pulled into Dawson, they dropped down the
steep bank by the Barracks to the Yukon Trail, and pulled for Dyea and
Salt Water. Perrault was carrying despatches if anything more urgent
than those he (<font color='blue'><b>Perrault</b></font>) had brought in; also, the travel pride had gripped him (<font color='blue'><b>Perrault</b></font>),
and he (<font color='blue'><b>Perrault</b></font>) purposed to make the record trip of the year. Several things
favored him (<font color='blue'><b>Perrault</b></font>) in this. The week's rest had recuperated the dogs and put
them in thorough trim. The trail they had broken into the country was
packed hard by later journeyers. And further, the police had arranged
in two or three places deposits of grub for dog and man, and he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) was
travelling light.

<p/>They made Sixty Mile, which is a fifty-mile run, on the first day; and
the second day saw them booming up the Yukon well on their way to Pelly.
But such splendid running was achieved not without great trouble and
vexation on the part of Francois. The insidious revolt led by Buck
had destroyed the solidarity of the team. It no longer was as one dog
leaping in the traces. The encouragement Buck gave the rebels led them
into all kinds of petty misdemeanors. No more was Spitz a leader greatly
to be feared. The old awe departed, and they grew equal to challenging
his (<font color='blue'><b>Spitz</b></font>) authority. Pike robbed him (<font color='blue'><b>Spitz</b></font>) of half a fish one night, and gulped
it down under the protection of Buck. Another night Dub and Joe fought
Spitz and made him (<font color='blue'><b>Spitz</b></font>) forego the punishment they deserved. And even
Billee, the good-natured, was less good-natured, and whined not half
so placatingly as in former days. Buck never came near Spitz without
snarling and bristling menacingly. In fact, his (<font color='blue'><b>Buck</b></font>) conduct approached that
of a bully, and he (<font color='blue'><b>Buck</b></font>) was given to swaggering up and down before Spitz's
very nose.

<p/>The breaking down of discipline likewise affected the dogs in their
relations with one another. They quarrelled and bickered more than ever
among themselves, till at times the camp was a howling bedlam. Dave and
Sol-leks alone were unaltered, though they were made irritable by the
unending squabbling. Francois swore strange barbarous oaths, and stamped
the snow in futile rage, and tore his (<font color='blue'><b>Francois</b></font>) hair. His (<font color='blue'><b>Francois</b></font>) lash was always singing
among the dogs, but it was of small avail. Directly his (<font color='blue'><b>Francois</b></font>) back was turned
they were at it again. He (<font color='blue'><b>Francois</b></font>) backed up Spitz with his (<font color='blue'><b>Francois</b></font>) whip, while Buck
backed up the remainder of the team. Francois knew he (<font color='blue'><b>Francois</b></font>) was behind all the
trouble, and Buck knew he (<font color='blue'><b>Buck</b></font>) knew; but Buck was too clever ever again to be
caught red-handed. He (<font color='blue'><b>Buck</b></font>) worked faithfully in the harness, for the toil
had become a delight to him (<font color='blue'><b>Buck</b></font>); yet it was a greater delight slyly to
precipitate a fight amongst his (<font color='blue'><b>Buck</b></font>) mates and tangle the traces.

<p/>At the mouth of the Tahkeena, one night after supper, Dub turned up a
snowshoe rabbit, blundered it, and missed. In a second the whole team
was in full cry. A hundred yards away was a camp of the Northwest
Police, with fifty dogs, huskies all, who joined the chase. The rabbit
sped down the river, turned off into a small creek, up the frozen bed of
which it held steadily. It ran lightly on the surface of the snow, while
the dogs ploughed through by main strength. Buck led the pack, sixty
strong, around bend after bend, but he (<font color='blue'><b>Buck</b></font>) could not gain. He (<font color='blue'><b>Buck</b></font>) lay down low
to the race, whining eagerly, his (<font color='blue'><b>Buck</b></font>) splendid body flashing forward, leap
by leap, in the wan white moonlight. And leap by leap, like some pale
frost wraith, the snowshoe rabbit flashed on ahead.

<p/>All that stirring of old instincts which at stated periods drives men
out from the sounding cities to forest and plain to kill things
by chemically propelled leaden pellets, the blood lust, the joy to
kill--all this was Buck's, only it was infinitely more intimate. He (<font color='blue'><b>Buck</b></font>) was
ranging at the head of the pack, running the wild thing down, the living
meat, to kill with his (<font color='blue'><b>Buck</b></font>) own teeth and wash his (<font color='blue'><b>Buck</b></font>) muzzle to the eyes in warm
blood.

<p/>There is an ecstasy that marks the summit of life, and beyond which life
cannot rise. And such is the paradox of living, this ecstasy comes when
one is most alive, and it comes as a complete forgetfulness that one is
alive. This ecstasy, this forgetfulness of living, comes to the artist,
caught up and out of himself in a sheet of flame; it comes to the
soldier, war-mad on a stricken field and refusing quarter; and it came
to Buck, leading the pack, sounding the old wolf-cry, straining after
the food that was alive and that fled swiftly before him (<font color='blue'><b>Buck</b></font>) through the
moonlight. He (<font color='blue'><b>Buck</b></font>) was sounding the deeps of his (<font color='blue'><b>Buck</b></font>) nature, and of the parts of
his (<font color='blue'><b>Buck</b></font>) nature that were deeper than he (<font color='blue'><b>Buck</b></font>), going back into the womb of Time.
He (<font color='blue'><b>Buck</b></font>) was mastered by the sheer surging of life, the tidal wave of being,
the perfect joy of each separate muscle, joint, and sinew in that it was
everything that was not death, that it was aglow and rampant, expressing
itself in movement, flying exultantly under the stars and over the face
of dead matter that did not move.

<p/>But Spitz, cold and calculating even in his (<font color='blue'><b>Spitz</b></font>) supreme moods, left the pack
and cut across a narrow neck of land where the creek made a long bend
around. Buck did not know of this, and as he (<font color='blue'><b>Buck</b></font>) rounded the bend, the frost
wraith of a rabbit still flitting before him (<font color='blue'><b>Buck</b></font>), he (<font color='blue'><b>Buck</b></font>) saw another and larger
frost wraith leap from the overhanging bank into the immediate path of
the rabbit. It was Spitz. The rabbit could not turn, and as the white
teeth broke its back in mid air it shrieked as loudly as a stricken man
may shriek. At sound of this, the cry of Life plunging down from Life's
apex in the grip of Death, the fall pack at Buck's heels raised a hell's
chorus of delight.

<p/>Buck did not cry out. He (<font color='blue'><b>Buck</b></font>) did not check himself, but drove in upon Spitz,
shoulder to shoulder, so hard that he (<font color='blue'><b>Spitz</b></font>) missed the throat. They rolled
over and over in the powdery snow. Spitz gained his (<font color='blue'><b>Spitz</b></font>) feet almost as
though he (<font color='blue'><b>Spitz</b></font>) had not been overthrown, slashing Buck down the shoulder and
leaping clear. Twice his (<font color='blue'><b>Buck</b></font>) teeth clipped together, like the steel jaws of
a trap, as he (<font color='blue'><b>Buck</b></font>) backed away for better footing, with lean and lifting lips
that writhed and snarled.

<p/>In a flash Buck knew it. The time had come. It was to the death. As
they circled about, snarling, ears laid back, keenly watchful for the
advantage, the scene came to Buck with a sense of familiarity. He (<font color='blue'><b>Buck</b></font>) seemed
to remember it all,--the white woods, and earth, and moonlight, and the
thrill of battle. Over the whiteness and silence brooded a ghostly calm.
There was not the faintest whisper of air--nothing moved, not a leaf
quivered, the visible breaths of the dogs rising slowly and lingering in
the frosty air. They had made short work of the snowshoe rabbit, these
dogs that were ill-tamed wolves; and they were now drawn up in an
expectant circle. They, too, were silent, their eyes only gleaming and
their breaths drifting slowly upward. To Buck it was nothing new or
strange, this scene of old time. It was as though it had always been,
the wonted way of things.

<p/>Spitz was a practised fighter. From Spitzbergen through the Arctic, and
across Canada and the Barrens, he (<font color='blue'><b>Spitz</b></font>) had held his (<font color='blue'><b>Spitz</b></font>) own with all manner of
dogs and achieved to mastery over them. Bitter rage was his (<font color='blue'><b>Spitz</b></font>), but never
blind rage. In passion to rend and destroy, he (<font color='blue'><b>Spitz</b></font>) never forgot that his (<font color='blue'><b>Spitz</b></font>)
enemy was in like passion to rend and destroy. He (<font color='blue'><b>Spitz</b></font>) never rushed till
he (<font color='blue'><b>Spitz</b></font>) was prepared to receive a rush; never attacked till he (<font color='blue'><b>Spitz</b></font>) had first
defended that attack.

<p/>In vain Buck strove to sink his (<font color='blue'><b>Buck</b></font>) teeth in the neck of the big white dog.
Wherever his (<font color='blue'><b>Buck</b></font>) fangs struck for the softer flesh, they were countered by
the fangs of Spitz. Fang clashed fang, and lips were cut and bleeding,
but Buck could not penetrate his (<font color='blue'><b>Buck</b></font>) enemy's guard. Then he (<font color='blue'><b>Buck</b></font>) warmed up and
enveloped Spitz in a whirlwind of rushes. Time and time again he (<font color='blue'><b>Spitz</b></font>) tried
for the snow-white throat, where life bubbled near to the surface, and
each time and every time Spitz slashed him (<font color='blue'><b>Spitz</b></font>) and got away. Then Buck took
to rushing, as though for the throat, when, suddenly drawing back his (<font color='blue'><b>Buck</b></font>)
head and curving in from the side, he (<font color='blue'><b>Buck</b></font>) would drive his (<font color='blue'><b>Buck</b></font>) shoulder at the
shoulder of Spitz, as a ram by which to overthrow him (<font color='blue'><b>Spitz</b></font>). But instead,
Buck's shoulder was slashed down each time as Spitz leaped lightly away.

<p/>Spitz was untouched, while Buck was streaming with blood and panting
hard. The fight was growing desperate. And all the while the silent and
wolfish circle waited to finish off whichever dog went down. As Buck
grew winded, Spitz took to rushing, and he (<font color='blue'><b>Spitz</b></font>) kept him (<font color='blue'><b>Spitz</b></font>) staggering for
footing. Once Buck went over, and the whole circle of sixty dogs started
up; but he (<font color='blue'><b>Buck</b></font>) recovered himself, almost in mid air, and the circle sank
down again and waited.

<p/>But Buck possessed a quality that made for greatness--imagination. He (<font color='blue'><b>Buck</b></font>)
fought by instinct, but he (<font color='blue'><b>Buck</b></font>) could fight by head as well. He (<font color='blue'><b>Buck</b></font>) rushed, as
though attempting the old shoulder trick, but at the last instant swept
low to the snow and in. His (<font color='blue'><b>Buck</b></font>) teeth closed on Spitz's left fore leg. There
was a crunch of breaking bone, and the white dog faced him (<font color='blue'><b>Spitz</b></font>) on three
legs. Thrice he (<font color='blue'><b>Spitz</b></font>) tried to knock him (<font color='blue'><b>Spitz</b></font>) over, then repeated the trick and
broke the right fore leg. Despite the pain and helplessness, Spitz
struggled madly to keep up. He (<font color='blue'><b>Spitz</b></font>) saw the silent circle, with gleaming
eyes, lolling tongues, and silvery breaths drifting upward, closing in
upon him (<font color='blue'><b>Spitz</b></font>) as he (<font color='blue'><b>Spitz</b></font>) had seen similar circles close in upon beaten antagonists
in the past. Only this time he (<font color='blue'><b>Spitz</b></font>) was the one who was beaten.

<p/>There was no hope for him (<font color='blue'><b>Spitz</b></font>). Buck was inexorable. Mercy was a thing
reserved for gentler climes. He (<font color='blue'><b>Buck</b></font>) manoeuvred for the final rush. The
circle had tightened till he (<font color='blue'><b>Buck</b></font>) could feel the breaths of the huskies on
his (<font color='blue'><b>Buck</b></font>) flanks. He (<font color='blue'><b>Buck</b></font>) could see them, beyond Spitz and to either side, half
crouching for the spring, their eyes fixed upon him (<font color='blue'><b>Spitz</b></font>). A pause seemed to
fall. Every animal was motionless as though turned to stone. Only Spitz
quivered and bristled as he (<font color='blue'><b>Spitz</b></font>) staggered back and forth, snarling with
horrible menace, as though to frighten off impending death. Then Buck
sprang in and out; but while he (<font color='blue'><b>Buck</b></font>) was in, shoulder had at last squarely
met shoulder. The dark circle became a dot on the moon-flooded snow as
Spitz disappeared from view. Buck stood and looked on, the successful
champion, the dominant primordial beast who had made his (<font color='blue'><b>Buck</b></font>) kill and found
it good.




<p/>Chapter IV. Who Has Won to Mastership


<p/><div class="bookquote">``Eh? Wot I say? I spik true w`en I say dat Buck two devils.''  (<font color='red'><b>Francois</b></font>)</div>This was
Francois's speech next morning when he (<font color='blue'><b>Francois</b></font>) discovered Spitz missing and Buck
covered with wounds. He (<font color='blue'><b>Buck</b></font>) drew him (<font color='blue'><b>Buck</b></font>) to the fire and by its light pointed
them out.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Dat Spitz fight lak hell,''  (<font color='red'><b>Perrault</b></font>)</div>said Perrault, as he (<font color='blue'><b>Perrault</b></font>) surveyed the gaping
rips and cuts.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``An' dat Buck fight lak two hells,''  (<font color='red'><b>Francois</b></font>)</div>was Francois's answer. <div class="bookquote">``An' now we
make good time. No more Spitz, no more trouble, sure.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Perrault</b></font>)</div><p/>While Perrault packed the camp outfit and loaded the sled, the
dog-driver proceeded to harness the dogs. Buck trotted up to the place
Spitz would have occupied as leader; but Francois, not noticing him (<font color='blue'><b>Spitz</b></font>),
brought Sol-leks to the coveted position. In his (<font color='blue'><b>Francois</b></font>) judgment, Sol-leks was
the best lead-dog left. Buck sprang upon Sol-leks in a fury, driving him (<font color='blue'><b>Buck</b></font>)
back and standing in his (<font color='blue'><b>Buck</b></font>) place.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Eh? eh?''  (<font color='red'><b>Francois</b></font>)</div>Francois cried, slapping his (<font color='blue'><b>Francois</b></font>) thighs gleefully. <div class="bookquote">``Look at dat
Buck. Heem keel dat Spitz, heem t`ink to take de job.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Go `way, Chook!''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Francois</b></font>) cried, but Buck refused to budge.

<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Buck</b></font>) took Buck by the scruff of the neck, and though the dog growled
threateningly, dragged him (<font color='blue'><b>Buck</b></font>) to one side and replaced Sol-leks. The old
dog did not like it, and showed plainly that he (<font color='blue'><b>Buck</b></font>) was afraid of Buck.
Francois was obdurate, but when he (<font color='blue'><b>Buck</b></font>) turned his (<font color='blue'><b>Buck</b></font>) back Buck again displaced
Sol-leks, who was not at all unwilling to go.

<p/>Francois was angry. <div class="bookquote">``Now, by Gar, I feex you!''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Francois</b></font>) cried, coming back
with a heavy club in his (<font color='blue'><b>Francois</b></font>) hand.

<p/>Buck remembered the man in the red sweater, and retreated slowly; nor
did he (<font color='blue'><b>Buck</b></font>) attempt to charge in when Sol-leks was once more brought
forward. But he (<font color='blue'><b>Buck</b></font>) circled just beyond the range of the club, snarling with
bitterness and rage; and while he (<font color='blue'><b>Buck</b></font>) circled he (<font color='blue'><b>Buck</b></font>) watched the club so as to
dodge it if thrown by Francois, for he (<font color='blue'><b>Francois</b></font>) was become wise in the way of
clubs. The driver went about his (<font color='blue'><b>driver</b></font>) work, and he (<font color='blue'><b>driver</b></font>) called to Buck when he (<font color='blue'><b>Buck</b></font>) was
ready to put him (<font color='blue'><b>Buck</b></font>) in his (<font color='blue'><b>Buck</b></font>) old place in front of Dave. Buck retreated two
or three steps. Francois followed him (<font color='blue'><b>Buck</b></font>) up, whereupon he (<font color='blue'><b>Buck</b></font>) again retreated.
After some time of this, Francois threw down the club, thinking that
Buck feared a thrashing. But Buck was in open revolt. He (<font color='blue'><b>Buck</b></font>) wanted, not to
escape a clubbing, but to have the leadership. It was his (<font color='blue'><b>Buck</b></font>) by right. He (<font color='blue'><b>Buck</b></font>)
had earned it, and he (<font color='blue'><b>Buck</b></font>) would not be content with less.

<p/>Perrault took a hand. Between them they ran him (<font color='blue'><b>Perrault</b></font>) about for the better
part of an hour. They threw clubs at him (<font color='blue'><b>Perrault</b></font>). He (<font color='blue'><b>Perrault</b></font>) dodged. They cursed him (<font color='blue'><b>Perrault</b></font>),
and his (<font color='blue'><b>Perrault</b></font>) fathers and mothers before him (<font color='blue'><b>Perrault</b></font>), and all his (<font color='blue'><b>Perrault</b></font>) seed to come after
him (<font color='blue'><b>Perrault</b></font>) down to the remotest generation, and every hair on his (<font color='blue'><b>Perrault</b></font>) body and drop
of blood in his (<font color='blue'><b>Perrault</b></font>) veins; and he (<font color='blue'><b>Perrault</b></font>) answered curse with snarl and kept out of
their reach. He (<font color='blue'><b>Perrault</b></font>) did not try to run away, but retreated around and around
the camp, advertising plainly that when his (<font color='blue'><b>Perrault</b></font>) desire was met, he (<font color='blue'><b>Perrault</b></font>) would
come in and be good.

<p/>Francois sat down and scratched his (<font color='blue'><b>Francois</b></font>) head. Perrault looked at his (<font color='blue'><b>Perrault</b></font>) watch
and swore. Time was flying, and they should have been on the trail an
hour gone. Francois scratched his (<font color='blue'><b>Francois</b></font>) head again. He (<font color='blue'><b>Francois</b></font>) shook it and grinned
sheepishly at the courier, who shrugged his (<font color='blue'><b>Francois</b></font>) shoulders in sign that they
were beaten. Then Francois went up to where Sol-leks stood and called
to Buck. Buck laughed, as dogs laugh, yet kept his (<font color='blue'><b>Buck</b></font>) distance. Francois
unfastened Sol-leks's traces and put him (<font color='blue'><b>Francois</b></font>) back in his (<font color='blue'><b>Francois</b></font>) old place. The team
stood harnessed to the sled in an unbroken line, ready for the trail.
There was no place for Buck save at the front. Once more Francois
called, and once more Buck laughed and kept away.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``T'row down de club,''  (<font color='red'><b>Perrault</b></font>)</div>Perrault commanded.

<p/>Francois complied, whereupon Buck trotted in, laughing triumphantly,
and swung around into position at the head of the team. His (<font color='blue'><b>Buck</b></font>) traces were
fastened, the sled broken out, and with both men running they dashed out
on to the river trail.

<p/>Highly as the dog-driver had forevalued Buck, with his (<font color='blue'><b>Buck</b></font>) two devils, he (<font color='blue'><b>Buck</b></font>)
found, while the day was yet young, that he (<font color='blue'><b>Buck</b></font>) had undervalued. At a bound
Buck took up the duties of leadership; and where judgment was required,
and quick thinking and quick acting, he (<font color='blue'><b>Buck</b></font>) showed himself the superior even
of Spitz, of whom Francois had never seen an equal.

<p/>But it was in giving the law and making his (<font color='blue'><b>Francois</b></font>) mates live up to it, that
Buck excelled. Dave and Sol-leks did not mind the change in leadership.
It was none of their business. Their business was to toil, and toil
mightily, in the traces. So long as that were not interfered with, they
did not care what happened. Billee, the good-natured, could lead for all
they cared, so long as he (<font color='blue'><b>Buck</b></font>) kept order. The rest of the team, however, had
grown unruly during the last days of Spitz, and their surprise was great
now that Buck proceeded to lick them into shape.

<p/>Pike, who pulled at Buck's heels, and who never put an ounce more of his (<font color='blue'><b>Buck</b></font>)
weight against the breast-band than he (<font color='blue'><b>Buck</b></font>) was compelled to do, was swiftly
and repeatedly shaken for loafing; and ere the first day was done he (<font color='blue'><b>Buck</b></font>) was
pulling more than ever before in his (<font color='blue'><b>Buck</b></font>) life. The first night in camp,
Joe, the sour one, was punished roundly--a thing that Spitz had never
succeeded in doing. Buck simply smothered him (<font color='blue'><b>Buck</b></font>) by virtue of superior
weight, and cut him (<font color='blue'><b>Buck</b></font>) up till he (<font color='blue'><b>Buck</b></font>) ceased snapping and began to whine for
mercy.

<p/>The general tone of the team picked up immediately. It recovered its
old-time solidarity, and once more the dogs leaped as one dog in the
traces. At the Rink Rapids two native huskies, Teek and Koona, were
added; and the celerity with which Buck broke them in took away
Francois's breath.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Nevaire such a dog as dat Buck!''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Buck</b></font>) cried. <div class="bookquote">``No, nevaire! Heem worth one
t`ousan' dollair, by Gar! Eh? Wot you say, Perrault?''

 (<font color='red'><b>Perrault</b></font>)</div><p/>And Perrault nodded. He (<font color='blue'><b>Perrault</b></font>) was ahead of the record then, and gaining day
by day. The trail was in excellent condition, well packed and hard, and
there was no new-fallen snow with which to contend. It was not too cold.
The temperature dropped to fifty below zero and remained there the whole
trip. The men rode and ran by turn, and the dogs were kept on the jump,
with but infrequent stoppages.

<p/>The Thirty Mile River was comparatively coated with ice, and they
covered in one day going out what had taken them ten days coming in. In
one run they made a sixty-mile dash from the foot of Lake Le Barge to
the White Horse Rapids. Across Marsh, Tagish, and Bennett -LRB-seventy miles
of lakes-RRB-, they flew so fast that the man whose turn it was to run
towed behind the sled at the end of a rope. And on the last night of the
second week they topped White Pass and dropped down the sea slope with
the lights of Skaguay and of the shipping at their feet.

<p/>It was a record run. Each day for fourteen days they had averaged forty
miles. For three days Perrault and Francois threw chests up and down the
main street of Skaguay and were deluged with invitations to drink, while
the team was the constant centre of a worshipful crowd of dog-busters
and mushers. Then three or four western bad men aspired to clean out
the town, were riddled like pepper-boxes for their pains, and public
interest turned to other idols. Next came official orders. Francois
called Buck to him (<font color='blue'><b>Francois</b></font>), threw his (<font color='blue'><b>Francois</b></font>) arms around him (<font color='blue'><b>Francois</b></font>), wept over him (<font color='blue'><b>Francois</b></font>). And that
was the last of Francois and Perrault. Like other men, they passed out
of Buck's life for good.

<p/>A Scotch half-breed took charge of him (<font color='blue'><b>Buck</b></font>) and his (<font color='blue'><b>Buck</b></font>) mates, and in company
with a dozen other dog-teams he (<font color='blue'><b>Buck</b></font>) started back over the weary trail to
Dawson. It was no light running now, nor record time, but heavy toil
each day, with a heavy load behind; for this was the mail train,
carrying word from the world to the men who sought gold under the shadow
of the Pole.

<p/>Buck did not like it, but he (<font color='blue'><b>Buck</b></font>) bore up well to the work, taking pride in
it after the manner of Dave and Sol-leks, and seeing that his (<font color='blue'><b>Dave</b></font>) mates,
whether they prided in it or not, did their fair share. It was a
monotonous life, operating with machine-like regularity. One day was
very like another. At a certain time each morning the cooks turned out,
fires were built, and breakfast was eaten. Then, while some broke camp,
others harnessed the dogs, and they were under way an hour or so before
the darkness fell which gave warning of dawn. At night, camp was made.
Some pitched the flies, others cut firewood and pine boughs for the
beds, and still others carried water or ice for the cooks. Also, the
dogs were fed. To them, this was the one feature of the day, though it
was good to loaf around, after the fish was eaten, for an hour or so
with the other dogs, of which there were fivescore and odd. There were
fierce fighters among them, but three battles with the fiercest brought
Buck to mastery, so that when he (<font color='blue'><b>Buck</b></font>) bristled and showed his (<font color='blue'><b>Buck</b></font>) teeth they got
out of his (<font color='blue'><b>Buck</b></font>) way.

<p/>Best of all, perhaps, he (<font color='blue'><b>Buck</b></font>) loved to lie near the fire, hind legs crouched
under him (<font color='blue'><b>Buck</b></font>), fore legs stretched out in front, head raised, and eyes
blinking dreamily at the flames. Sometimes he (<font color='blue'><b>Buck</b></font>) thought of Judge Miller's
big house in the sun-kissed Santa Clara Valley, and of the cement
swimming-tank, and Ysabel, the Mexican hairless, and Toots, the Japanese
pug; but oftener he (<font color='blue'><b>Santa</b></font>) remembered the man in the red sweater, the death of
Curly, the great fight with Spitz, and the good things he (<font color='blue'><b>Spitz</b></font>) had eaten or
would like to eat. He (<font color='blue'><b>Spitz</b></font>) was not homesick. The Sunland was very dim and
distant, and such memories had no power over him (<font color='blue'><b>Spitz</b></font>). Far more potent were
the memories of his (<font color='blue'><b>Spitz</b></font>) heredity that gave things he (<font color='blue'><b>Spitz</b></font>) had never seen before
a seeming familiarity; the instincts -LRB-which were but the memories of
his (<font color='blue'><b>Spitz</b></font>) ancestors become habits-RRB- which had lapsed in later days, and still
later, in him (<font color='blue'><b>Spitz</b></font>), quickened and become alive again.

<p/>Sometimes as he (<font color='blue'><b>Spitz</b></font>) crouched there, blinking dreamily at the flames, it
seemed that the flames were of another fire, and that as he (<font color='blue'><b>Spitz</b></font>) crouched
by this other fire he (<font color='blue'><b>Spitz</b></font>) saw another and different man from the half-breed
cook before him (<font color='blue'><b>Spitz</b></font>). This other man was shorter of leg and longer of arm,
with muscles that were stringy and knotty rather than rounded and
swelling. The hair of this man was long and matted, and his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) head slanted
back under it from the eyes. He (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) uttered strange sounds, and seemed very
much afraid of the darkness, into which he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) peered continually, clutching
in his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) hand, which hung midway between knee and foot, a stick with a
heavy stone made fast to the end. He (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) was all but naked, a ragged and
fire-scorched skin hanging part way down his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) back, but on his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) body there
was much hair. In some places, across the chest and shoulders and down
the outside of the arms and thighs, it was matted into almost a thick
fur. He (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) did not stand erect, but with trunk inclined forward from
the hips, on legs that bent at the knees. About his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) body there was
a peculiar springiness, or resiliency, almost catlike, and a quick
alertness as of one who lived in perpetual fear of things seen and
unseen.

<p/>At other times this hairy man squatted by the fire with head between
his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) legs and slept. On such occasions his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) elbows were on his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) knees, his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>)
hands clasped above his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) head as though to shed rain by the hairy arms.
And beyond that fire, in the circling darkness, Buck could see many
gleaming coals, two by two, always two by two, which he (<font color='blue'><b>Buck</b></font>) knew to be the
eyes of great beasts of prey. And he (<font color='blue'><b>Buck</b></font>) could hear the crashing of their
bodies through the undergrowth, and the noises they made in the night.
And dreaming there by the Yukon bank, with lazy eyes blinking at the
fire, these sounds and sights of another world would make the hair to
rise along his (<font color='blue'><b>Buck</b></font>) back and stand on end across his (<font color='blue'><b>Buck</b></font>) shoulders and up his (<font color='blue'><b>Buck</b></font>)
neck, till he (<font color='blue'><b>Buck</b></font>) whimpered low and suppressedly, or growled softly, and the
half-breed cook shouted at him (<font color='blue'><b>cook</b></font>), <div class="bookquote">``Hey, you Buck, wake up!''  (<font color='red'><b>him</b></font>)</div>Whereupon the
other world would vanish and the real world come into his (<font color='blue'><b>cook</b></font>) eyes, and he (<font color='blue'><b>cook</b></font>)
would get up and yawn and stretch as though he (<font color='blue'><b>cook</b></font>) had been asleep.

<p/>It was a hard trip, with the mail behind them, and the heavy work wore
them down. They were short of weight and in poor condition when they
made Dawson, and should have had a ten days' or a week's rest at
least. But in two days' time they dropped down the Yukon bank from the
Barracks, loaded with letters for the outside. The dogs were tired, the
drivers grumbling, and to make matters worse, it snowed every day. This
meant a soft trail, greater friction on the runners, and heavier pulling
for the dogs; yet the drivers were fair through it all, and did their
best for the animals.

<p/>Each night the dogs were attended to first. They ate before the drivers
ate, and no man sought his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) sleeping-robe till he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) had seen to the feet of
the dogs he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) drove. Still, their strength went down. Since the beginning
of the winter they had travelled eighteen hundred miles, dragging sleds
the whole weary distance; and eighteen hundred miles will tell upon life
of the toughest. Buck stood it, keeping his (<font color='blue'><b>Buck</b></font>) mates up to their work and
maintaining discipline, though he (<font color='blue'><b>Buck</b></font>), too, was very tired. Billee cried and
whimpered regularly in his (<font color='blue'><b>Buck</b></font>) sleep each night. Joe was sourer than ever,
and Sol-leks was unapproachable, blind side or other side.

<p/>But it was Dave who suffered most of all. Something had gone wrong with
him (<font color='blue'><b>Dave</b></font>). He (<font color='blue'><b>Dave</b></font>) became more morose and irritable, and when camp was pitched at
once made his (<font color='blue'><b>Dave</b></font>) nest, where his (<font color='blue'><b>Dave</b></font>) driver fed him (<font color='blue'><b>Dave</b></font>). Once out of the harness
and down, he (<font color='blue'><b>Dave</b></font>) did not get on his (<font color='blue'><b>Dave</b></font>) feet again till harness-up time in the
morning. Sometimes, in the traces, when jerked by a sudden stoppage of
the sled, or by straining to start it, he (<font color='blue'><b>Dave</b></font>) would cry out with pain. The
driver examined him (<font color='blue'><b>driver</b></font>), but could find nothing. All the drivers became
interested in his (<font color='blue'><b>driver</b></font>) case. They talked it over at meal-time, and over their
last pipes before going to bed, and one night they held a consultation.
He (<font color='blue'><b>driver</b></font>) was brought from his (<font color='blue'><b>driver</b></font>) nest to the fire and was pressed and prodded
till he (<font color='blue'><b>driver</b></font>) cried out many times. Something was wrong inside, but they could
locate no broken bones, could not make it out.

<p/>By the time Cassiar Bar was reached, he (<font color='blue'><b>driver</b></font>) was so weak that he (<font color='blue'><b>driver</b></font>) was falling
repeatedly in the traces. The Scotch half-breed called a halt and took
him (<font color='blue'><b>driver</b></font>) out of the team, making the next dog, Sol-leks, fast to the sled.
His (<font color='blue'><b>driver</b></font>) intention was to rest Dave, letting him (<font color='blue'><b>driver</b></font>) run free behind the sled.
Sick as he (<font color='blue'><b>driver</b></font>) was, Dave resented being taken out, grunting and growling
while the traces were unfastened, and whimpering broken-heartedly when
he (<font color='blue'><b>Dave</b></font>) saw Sol-leks in the position he (<font color='blue'><b>Dave</b></font>) had held and served so long. For the
pride of trace and trail was his (<font color='blue'><b>Dave</b></font>), and, sick unto death, he (<font color='blue'><b>Dave</b></font>) could not
bear that another dog should do his (<font color='blue'><b>Dave</b></font>) work.

<p/>When the sled started, he (<font color='blue'><b>Dave</b></font>) floundered in the soft snow alongside the
beaten trail, attacking Sol-leks with his (<font color='blue'><b>Dave</b></font>) teeth, rushing against him (<font color='blue'><b>Dave</b></font>) and
trying to thrust him (<font color='blue'><b>Dave</b></font>) off into the soft snow on the other side, striving
to leap inside his (<font color='blue'><b>Dave</b></font>) traces and get between him (<font color='blue'><b>Dave</b></font>) and the sled, and all the
while whining and yelping and crying with grief and pain. The half-breed
tried to drive him (<font color='blue'><b>Dave</b></font>) away with the whip; but he (<font color='blue'><b>Dave</b></font>) paid no heed to the
stinging lash, and the man had not the heart to strike harder. Dave
refused to run quietly on the trail behind the sled, where the going was
easy, but continued to flounder alongside in the soft snow, where the
going was most difficult, till exhausted. Then he (<font color='blue'><b>Dave</b></font>) fell, and lay where he (<font color='blue'><b>Dave</b></font>)
fell, howling lugubriously as the long train of sleds churned by.

<p/>With the last remnant of his (<font color='blue'><b>Dave</b></font>) strength he (<font color='blue'><b>Dave</b></font>) managed to stagger along behind
till the train made another stop, when he (<font color='blue'><b>Dave</b></font>) floundered past the sleds to
his (<font color='blue'><b>Dave</b></font>) own, where he (<font color='blue'><b>Dave</b></font>) stood alongside Sol-leks. His (<font color='blue'><b>Dave</b></font>) driver lingered a moment
to get a light for his (<font color='blue'><b>Dave</b></font>) pipe from the man behind. Then he (<font color='blue'><b>Dave</b></font>) returned and
started his (<font color='blue'><b>Dave</b></font>) dogs. They swung out on the trail with remarkable lack of
exertion, turned their heads uneasily, and stopped in surprise. The
driver was surprised, too; the sled had not moved. He (<font color='blue'><b>driver</b></font>) called his (<font color='blue'><b>driver</b></font>)
comrades to witness the sight. Dave had bitten through both of
Sol-leks's traces, and was standing directly in front of the sled in his (<font color='blue'><b>Dave</b></font>)
proper place.

<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Dave</b></font>) pleaded with his (<font color='blue'><b>Dave</b></font>) eyes to remain there. The driver was perplexed. His (<font color='blue'><b>driver</b></font>)
comrades talked of how a dog could break its heart through being denied
the work that killed it, and recalled instances they had known, where
dogs, too old for the toil, or injured, had died because they were cut
out of the traces. Also, they held it a mercy, since Dave was to die
anyway, that he (<font color='blue'><b>Dave</b></font>) should die in the traces, heart-easy and content. So
he (<font color='blue'><b>Dave</b></font>) was harnessed in again, and proudly he (<font color='blue'><b>Dave</b></font>) pulled as of old, though more
than once he (<font color='blue'><b>Dave</b></font>) cried out involuntarily from the bite of his (<font color='blue'><b>Dave</b></font>) inward hurt.
Several times he (<font color='blue'><b>Dave</b></font>) fell down and was dragged in the traces, and once the
sled ran upon him (<font color='blue'><b>Dave</b></font>) so that he (<font color='blue'><b>Dave</b></font>) limped thereafter in one of his (<font color='blue'><b>Dave</b></font>) hind legs.

<p/>But he (<font color='blue'><b>Dave</b></font>) held out till camp was reached, when his (<font color='blue'><b>Dave</b></font>) driver made a place for
him (<font color='blue'><b>Dave</b></font>) by the fire. Morning found him (<font color='blue'><b>Dave</b></font>) too weak to travel. At harness-up
time he (<font color='blue'><b>Dave</b></font>) tried to crawl to his (<font color='blue'><b>Dave</b></font>) driver. By convulsive efforts he (<font color='blue'><b>Dave</b></font>) got on
his (<font color='blue'><b>Dave</b></font>) feet, staggered, and fell. Then he (<font color='blue'><b>Dave</b></font>) wormed his (<font color='blue'><b>Dave</b></font>) way forward slowly
toward where the harnesses were being put on his (<font color='blue'><b>Dave</b></font>) mates. He (<font color='blue'><b>Dave</b></font>) would advance
his (<font color='blue'><b>Dave</b></font>) fore legs and drag up his (<font color='blue'><b>Dave</b></font>) body with a sort of hitching movement,
when he (<font color='blue'><b>Dave</b></font>) would advance his (<font color='blue'><b>Dave</b></font>) fore legs and hitch ahead again for a few more
inches. His (<font color='blue'><b>Dave</b></font>) strength left him (<font color='blue'><b>Dave</b></font>), and the last his (<font color='blue'><b>Dave</b></font>) mates saw of him (<font color='blue'><b>Dave</b></font>) he (<font color='blue'><b>Dave</b></font>) lay
gasping in the snow and yearning toward them. But they could hear him (<font color='blue'><b>Dave</b></font>)
mournfully howling till they passed out of sight behind a belt of river
timber.

<p/>Here the train was halted. The Scotch half-breed slowly retraced his (<font color='blue'><b>Dave</b></font>)
steps to the camp they had left. The men ceased talking. A revolver-shot
rang out. The man came back hurriedly. The whips snapped, the bells
tinkled merrily, the sleds churned along the trail; but Buck knew, and
every dog knew, what had taken place behind the belt of river trees.




<p/>Chapter V. The Toil of Trace and Trail


<p/>Thirty days from the time it left Dawson, the Salt Water Mail, with Buck
and his (<font color='blue'><b>Buck</b></font>) mates at the fore, arrived at Skaguay. They were in a wretched
state, worn out and worn down. Buck's one hundred and forty pounds
had dwindled to one hundred and fifteen. The rest of his (<font color='blue'><b>Buck</b></font>) mates, though
lighter dogs, had relatively lost more weight than he (<font color='blue'><b>Buck</b></font>). Pike, the
malingerer, who, in his (<font color='blue'><b>Buck</b></font>) lifetime of deceit, had often successfully
feigned a hurt leg, was now limping in earnest. Sol-leks was limping,
and Dub was suffering from a wrenched shoulder-blade.

<p/>They were all terribly footsore. No spring or rebound was left in them.
Their feet fell heavily on the trail, jarring their bodies and doubling
the fatigue of a day's travel. There was nothing the matter with them
except that they were dead tired. It was not the dead-tiredness that
comes through brief and excessive effort, from which recovery is a
matter of hours; but it was the dead-tiredness that comes through the
slow and prolonged strength drainage of months of toil. There was no
power of recuperation left, no reserve strength to call upon. It had
been all used, the last least bit of it. Every muscle, every fibre,
every cell, was tired, dead tired. And there was reason for it. In less
than five months they had travelled twenty-five hundred miles, during
the last eighteen hundred of which they had had but five days' rest.
When they arrived at Skaguay they were apparently on their last legs.
They could barely keep the traces taut, and on the down grades just
managed to keep out of the way of the sled.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Mush on, poor sore feets,''  (<font color='red'><b>the driver</b></font>)</div>the driver encouraged them as they tottered
down the main street of Skaguay. <div class="bookquote">``Dis is de las'. Den we get one long
res'. Eh? For sure. One bully long res'.''

 (<font color='red'><b>The drivers</b></font>)</div><p/>The drivers confidently expected a long stopover. Themselves, they had
covered twelve hundred miles with two days' rest, and in the nature of
reason and common justice they deserved an interval of loafing. But so
many were the men who had rushed into the Klondike, and so many were the
sweethearts, wives, and kin that had not rushed in, that the congested
mail was taking on Alpine proportions; also, there were official orders.
Fresh batches of Hudson Bay dogs were to take the places of those
worthless for the trail. The worthless ones were to be got rid of, and,
since dogs count for little against dollars, they were to be sold.

<p/>Three days passed, by which time Buck and his (<font color='blue'><b>Buck</b></font>) mates found how really
tired and weak they were. Then, on the morning of the fourth day, two
men from the States came along and bought them, harness and all, for a
song. The men addressed each other as <div class="bookquote">``Hal''  (<font color='red'><b>The men</b></font>)</div>and <div class="bookquote">``Charles.''  (<font color='red'><b>The men</b></font>)</div>Charles was
a middle-aged, lightish-colored man, with weak and watery eyes and a
mustache that twisted fiercely and vigorously up, giving the lie to the
limply drooping lip it concealed. Hal was a youngster of nineteen or
twenty, with a big Colt's revolver and a hunting-knife strapped about
him (<font color='blue'><b>Hal</b></font>) on a belt that fairly bristled with cartridges. This belt was the
most salient thing about him (<font color='blue'><b>Hal</b></font>). It advertised his (<font color='blue'><b>Hal</b></font>) callowness--a callowness
sheer and unutterable. Both men were manifestly out of place, and why
such as they should adventure the North is part of the mystery of things
that passes understanding.

<p/>Buck heard the chaffering, saw the money pass between the man and the
Government agent, and knew that the Scotch half-breed and the mail-train
drivers were passing out of his (<font color='blue'><b>Buck</b></font>) life on the heels of Perrault and
Francois and the others who had gone before. When driven with his (<font color='blue'><b>Francois</b></font>) mates
to the new owners' camp, Buck saw a slipshod and slovenly affair, tent
half stretched, dishes unwashed, everything in disorder; also, he (<font color='blue'><b>Buck</b></font>) saw a
woman. <div class="bookquote">``Mercedes''  (<font color='red'><b>the men</b></font>)</div>the men called her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>). She (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) was Charles's wife and Hal's
sister--a nice family party.

<p/>Buck watched them apprehensively as they proceeded to take down the tent
and load the sled. There was a great deal of effort about their manner,
but no businesslike method. The tent was rolled into an awkward bundle
three times as large as it should have been. The tin dishes were packed
away unwashed. Mercedes continually fluttered in the way of her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) men and
kept up an unbroken chattering of remonstrance and advice. When they put
a clothes-sack on the front of the sled, she (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) suggested it should go on
the back; and when they had put it on the back, and covered it over
with a couple of other bundles, she (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) discovered overlooked articles which
could abide nowhere else but in that very sack, and they unloaded again.

<p/>Three men from a neighboring tent came out and looked on, grinning and
winking at one another.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``You've got a right smart load as it is,''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>said one of them; <div class="bookquote">``and it's
not me should tell you your business, but I wouldn't tote that tent
along if I was you.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Undreamed of!''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>cried Mercedes, throwing up her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) hands in dainty dismay.
<div class="bookquote">``However in the world could I manage without a tent?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``It's springtime, and you won't get any more cold weather,''  (<font color='red'><b>the man</b></font>)</div>the man
replied.

<p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) shook her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) head decidedly, and Charles and Hal put the last odds and
ends on top the mountainous load.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Think it'll ride?''  (<font color='red'><b>the men</b></font>)</div>one of the men asked.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Why shouldn't it?''  (<font color='red'><b>Charles</b></font>)</div>Charles demanded rather shortly.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Oh, that's all right, that's all right,''  (<font color='red'><b>the man</b></font>)</div>the man hastened meekly to
say. <div class="bookquote">``I was just a-wonderin', that is all. It seemed a mite top-heavy.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Charles</b></font>)</div><p/>Charles turned his (<font color='blue'><b>Charles</b></font>) back and drew the lashings down as well as he (<font color='blue'><b>Charles</b></font>) could,
which was not in the least well.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``An' of course the dogs can hike along all day with that contraption
behind them,''  (<font color='red'><b>the men</b></font>)</div>affirmed a second of the men.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Certainly,''  (<font color='red'><b>Hal</b></font>)</div>said Hal, with freezing politeness, taking hold of the
gee-pole with one hand and swinging his (<font color='blue'><b>Hal</b></font>) whip from the other. <div class="bookquote">``Mush!''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Hal</b></font>)
shouted. <div class="bookquote">``Mush on there!''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/>The dogs sprang against the breast-bands, strained hard for a few
moments, then relaxed. They were unable to move the sled.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``The lazy brutes, I'll show them,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Hal</b></font>) cried, preparing to lash out at
them with the whip.

<p/>But Mercedes interfered, crying, <div class="bookquote">``Oh, Hal, you mustn't,''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>as she (<font color='blue'><b>Hal</b></font>) caught
hold of the whip and wrenched it from him (<font color='blue'><b>Hal</b></font>). <div class="bookquote">``The poor dears! Now you
must promise you won't be harsh with them for the rest of the trip, or I
won't go a step.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Precious lot you know about dogs,''  (<font color='red'><b>brother</b></font>)</div>her (<font color='blue'><b>Hal</b></font>) brother sneered; <div class="bookquote">``and I wish
you'd leave me alone. They're lazy, I tell you, and you've got to whip
them to get anything out of them. That's their way. You ask any one. Ask
one of those men.''

 (<font color='red'><b>brother</b></font>)</div><p/>Mercedes looked at them imploringly, untold repugnance at sight of pain
written in her (<font color='blue'><b>Hal</b></font>) pretty face.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``They're weak as water, if you want to know,''  (<font color='red'><b>the men</b></font>)</div>came the reply from one
of the men. <div class="bookquote">``Plum tuckered out, that's what's the matter. They need a
rest.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Rest be blanked,''  (<font color='red'><b>Hal</b></font>)</div>said Hal, with his (<font color='blue'><b>Hal</b></font>) beardless lips; and Mercedes said,
<div class="bookquote">``Oh!''  (<font color='red'><b>Hal</b></font>)</div>in pain and sorrow at the oath.

<p/>But she (<font color='blue'><b>Hal</b></font>) was a clannish creature, and rushed at once to the defence of
her (<font color='blue'><b>Hal</b></font>) brother. <div class="bookquote">``Never mind that man,''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Hal</b></font>) said pointedly. <div class="bookquote">``You're driving
our dogs, and you do what you think best with them.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Hal</b></font>)</div><p/>Again Hal's whip fell upon the dogs. They threw themselves against the
breast-bands, dug their feet into the packed snow, got down low to it,
and put forth all their strength. The sled held as though it were an
anchor. After two efforts, they stood still, panting. The whip was
whistling savagely, when once more Mercedes interfered. She (<font color='blue'><b>Hal</b></font>) dropped on
her (<font color='blue'><b>Hal</b></font>) knees before Buck, with tears in her (<font color='blue'><b>Hal</b></font>) eyes, and put her (<font color='blue'><b>Hal</b></font>) arms around
his (<font color='blue'><b>Buck</b></font>) neck.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``You poor, poor dears,''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Hal</b></font>) cried sympathetically, <div class="bookquote">``why don't you pull
hard?--then you wouldn't be whipped.''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>Buck did not like her (<font color='blue'><b>Hal</b></font>), but he (<font color='blue'><b>Buck</b></font>)
was feeling too miserable to resist her (<font color='blue'><b>Hal</b></font>), taking it as part of the day's
miserable work.

<p/>One of the onlookers, who had been clenching his (<font color='blue'><b>Buck</b></font>) teeth to suppress hot
speech, now spoke up:--

<p/><div class="bookquote">``It's not that I care a whoop what becomes of you, but for the dogs'
sakes I just want to tell you, you can help them a mighty lot by
breaking out that sled. The runners are froze fast. Throw your weight
against the gee-pole, right and left, and break it out.''

 (<font color='red'><b>the onlookers</b></font>)</div><p/>A third time the attempt was made, but this time, following the advice,
Hal broke out the runners which had been frozen to the snow. The
overloaded and unwieldy sled forged ahead, Buck and his (<font color='blue'><b>Buck</b></font>) mates struggling
frantically under the rain of blows. A hundred yards ahead the path
turned and sloped steeply into the main street. It would have required
an experienced man to keep the top-heavy sled upright, and Hal was not
such a man. As they swung on the turn the sled went over, spilling
half its load through the loose lashings. The dogs never stopped. The
lightened sled bounded on its side behind them. They were angry because
of the ill treatment they had received and the unjust load. Buck was
raging. He (<font color='blue'><b>Buck</b></font>) broke into a run, the team following his (<font color='blue'><b>Buck</b></font>) lead. Hal cried
<div class="bookquote">``Whoa! whoa!''  (<font color='red'><b>Hal</b></font>)</div>but they gave no heed. He (<font color='blue'><b>Hal</b></font>) tripped and was pulled off his (<font color='blue'><b>Hal</b></font>)
feet. The capsized sled ground over him (<font color='blue'><b>Hal</b></font>), and the dogs dashed on up the
street, adding to the gayety of Skaguay as they scattered the remainder
of the outfit along its chief thoroughfare.

<p/>Kind-hearted citizens caught the dogs and gathered up the scattered
belongings. Also, they gave advice. Half the load and twice the dogs,
if they ever expected to reach Dawson, was what was said. Hal and
his (<font color='blue'><b>Hal</b></font>) sister and brother-in-law listened unwillingly, pitched tent, and
overhauled the outfit. Canned goods were turned out that made men laugh,
for canned goods on the Long Trail is a thing to dream about. <div class="bookquote">``Blankets
for a hotel''  (<font color='red'><b>the men</b></font>)</div>quoth one of the men who laughed and helped. <div class="bookquote">``Half as
many is too much; get rid of them. Throw away that tent, and all those
dishes,--who's going to wash them, anyway? Good Lord, do you think
you're travelling on a Pullman?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/>And so it went, the inexorable elimination of the superfluous. Mercedes
cried when her (<font color='blue'><b>sister</b></font>) clothes-bags were dumped on the ground and article
after article was thrown out. She (<font color='blue'><b>sister</b></font>) cried in general, and she (<font color='blue'><b>sister</b></font>) cried in
particular over each discarded thing. She (<font color='blue'><b>sister</b></font>) clasped hands about knees,
rocking back and forth broken-heartedly. She (<font color='blue'><b>sister</b></font>) averred she (<font color='blue'><b>sister</b></font>) would not go
an inch, not for a dozen Charleses. She (<font color='blue'><b>sister</b></font>) appealed to everybody and to
everything, finally wiping her (<font color='blue'><b>sister</b></font>) eyes and proceeding to cast out even
articles of apparel that were imperative necessaries. And in her (<font color='blue'><b>sister</b></font>) zeal,
when she (<font color='blue'><b>sister</b></font>) had finished with her (<font color='blue'><b>sister</b></font>) own, she (<font color='blue'><b>sister</b></font>) attacked the belongings of her (<font color='blue'><b>sister</b></font>)
men and went through them like a tornado.

<p/>This accomplished, the outfit, though cut in half, was still a
formidable bulk. Charles and Hal went out in the evening and bought six
Outside dogs. These, added to the six of the original team, and Teek
and Koona, the huskies obtained at the Rink Rapids on the record
trip, brought the team up to fourteen. But the Outside dogs, though
practically broken in since their landing, did not amount to much. Three
were short-haired pointers, one was a Newfoundland, and the other
two were mongrels of indeterminate breed. They did not seem to know
anything, these newcomers. Buck and his (<font color='blue'><b>Buck</b></font>) comrades looked upon them with
disgust, and though he (<font color='blue'><b>Buck</b></font>) speedily taught them their places and what not
to do, he (<font color='blue'><b>Buck</b></font>) could not teach them what to do. They did not take kindly
to trace and trail. With the exception of the two mongrels, they were
bewildered and spirit-broken by the strange savage environment in which
they found themselves and by the ill treatment they had received. The
two mongrels were without spirit at all; bones were the only things
breakable about them.

<p/>With the newcomers hopeless and forlorn, and the old team worn out by
twenty-five hundred miles of continuous trail, the outlook was anything
but bright. The two men, however, were quite cheerful. And they were
proud, too. They were doing the thing in style, with fourteen dogs. They
had seen other sleds depart over the Pass for Dawson, or come in from
Dawson, but never had they seen a sled with so many as fourteen dogs. In
the nature of Arctic travel there was a reason why fourteen dogs should
not drag one sled, and that was that one sled could not carry the food
for fourteen dogs. But Charles and Hal did not know this. They had
worked the trip out with a pencil, so much to a dog, so many dogs,
so many days, Q.E.D. Mercedes looked over their shoulders and nodded
comprehensively, it was all so very simple.

<p/>Late next morning Buck led the long team up the street. There was
nothing lively about it, no snap or go in him (<font color='blue'><b>Buck</b></font>) and his (<font color='blue'><b>Buck</b></font>) fellows. They were
starting dead weary. Four times he (<font color='blue'><b>Buck</b></font>) had covered the distance between Salt
Water and Dawson, and the knowledge that, jaded and tired, he (<font color='blue'><b>Dawson</b></font>) was facing
the same trail once more, made him (<font color='blue'><b>Dawson</b></font>) bitter. His (<font color='blue'><b>Dawson</b></font>) heart was not in
the work, nor was the heart of any dog. The Outsides were timid and
frightened, the Insides without confidence in their masters.

<p/>Buck felt vaguely that there was no depending upon these two men and the
woman. They did not know how to do anything, and as the days went by
it became apparent that they could not learn. They were slack in all
things, without order or discipline. It took them half the night to
pitch a slovenly camp, and half the morning to break that camp and get
the sled loaded in fashion so slovenly that for the rest of the day they
were occupied in stopping and rearranging the load. Some days they did
not make ten miles. On other days they were unable to get started
at all. And on no day did they succeed in making more than half the
distance used by the men as a basis in their dog-food computation.

<p/>It was inevitable that they should go short on dog-food. But they
hastened it by overfeeding, bringing the day nearer when underfeeding
would commence. The Outside dogs, whose digestions had not been trained
by chronic famine to make the most of little, had voracious appetites.
And when, in addition to this, the worn-out huskies pulled weakly, Hal
decided that the orthodox ration was too small. He (<font color='blue'><b>Hal</b></font>) doubled it. And to
cap it all, when Mercedes, with tears in her (<font color='blue'><b>It</b></font>) pretty eyes and a quaver
in her (<font color='blue'><b>It</b></font>) throat, could not cajole him (<font color='blue'><b>Hal</b></font>) into giving the dogs still more, she (<font color='blue'><b>It</b></font>)
stole from the fish-sacks and fed them slyly. But it was not food that
Buck and the huskies needed, but rest. And though they were making poor
time, the heavy load they dragged sapped their strength severely.

<p/>Then came the underfeeding. Hal awoke one day to the fact that his (<font color='blue'><b>Hal</b></font>)
dog-food was half gone and the distance only quarter covered; further,
that for love or money no additional dog-food was to be obtained. So
he (<font color='blue'><b>Hal</b></font>) cut down even the orthodox ration and tried to increase the day's
travel. His (<font color='blue'><b>Hal</b></font>) sister and brother-in-law seconded him (<font color='blue'><b>Hal</b></font>); but they were
frustrated by their heavy outfit and their own incompetence. It was a
simple matter to give the dogs less food; but it was impossible to
make the dogs travel faster, while their own inability to get under way
earlier in the morning prevented them from travelling longer hours. Not
only did they not know how to work dogs, but they did not know how to
work themselves.

<p/>The first to go was Dub. Poor blundering thief that he (<font color='blue'><b>thief</b></font>) was, always
getting caught and punished, he (<font color='blue'><b>thief</b></font>) had none the less been a faithful
worker. His (<font color='blue'><b>thief</b></font>) wrenched shoulder-blade, untreated and unrested, went from
bad to worse, till finally Hal shot him (<font color='blue'><b>Hal</b></font>) with the big Colt's revolver. It
is a saying of the country that an Outside dog starves to death on the
ration of the husky, so the six Outside dogs under Buck could do no less
than die on half the ration of the husky. The Newfoundland went first,
followed by the three short-haired pointers, the two mongrels hanging
more grittily on to life, but going in the end.

<p/>By this time all the amenities and gentlenesses of the Southland had
fallen away from the three people. Shorn of its glamour and romance,
Arctic travel became to them a reality too harsh for their manhood and
womanhood. Mercedes ceased weeping over the dogs, being too occupied
with weeping over herself and with quarrelling with her (<font color='blue'><b>their</b></font>) husband and
brother. To quarrel was the one thing they were never too weary to do.
Their irritability arose out of their misery, increased with it, doubled
upon it, outdistanced it. The wonderful patience of the trail which
comes to men who toil hard and suffer sore, and remain sweet of speech
and kindly, did not come to these two men and the woman. They had no
inkling of such a patience. They were stiff and in pain; their muscles
ached, their bones ached, their very hearts ached; and because of this
they became sharp of speech, and hard words were first on their lips in
the morning and last at night.

<p/>Charles and Hal wrangled whenever Mercedes gave them a chance. It was
the cherished belief of each that he (<font color='blue'><b>Charles</b></font>) did more than his (<font color='blue'><b>Charles</b></font>) share of the
work, and neither forbore to speak this belief at every opportunity.
Sometimes Mercedes sided with her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) husband, sometimes with her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) brother.
The result was a beautiful and unending family quarrel. Starting from
a dispute as to which should chop a few sticks for the fire -LRB-a dispute
which concerned only Charles and Hal-RRB-, presently would be lugged in the
rest of the family, fathers, mothers, uncles, cousins, people thousands
of miles away, and some of them dead. That Hal's views on art, or the
sort of society plays his (<font color='blue'><b>Hal</b></font>) mother's brother wrote, should have
anything to do with the chopping of a few sticks of firewood, passes
comprehension; nevertheless the quarrel was as likely to tend in that
direction as in the direction of Charles's political prejudices. And
that Charles's sister's tale-bearing tongue should be relevant to the
building of a Yukon fire, was apparent only to Mercedes, who disburdened
herself of copious opinions upon that topic, and incidentally upon a
few other traits unpleasantly peculiar to her (<font color='blue'><b>sister</b></font>) husband's family. In the
meantime the fire remained unbuilt, the camp half pitched, and the dogs
unfed.

<p/>Mercedes nursed a special grievance--the grievance of sex. She (<font color='blue'><b>sister</b></font>) was
pretty and soft, and had been chivalrously treated all her (<font color='blue'><b>sister</b></font>) days. But
the present treatment by her (<font color='blue'><b>sister</b></font>) husband and brother was everything save
chivalrous. It was her (<font color='blue'><b>sister</b></font>) custom to be helpless. They complained. Upon
which impeachment of what to her (<font color='blue'><b>sister</b></font>) was her (<font color='blue'><b>sister</b></font>) most essential sex-prerogative,
she (<font color='blue'><b>sister</b></font>) made their lives unendurable. She (<font color='blue'><b>sister</b></font>) no longer considered the dogs, and
because she (<font color='blue'><b>sister</b></font>) was sore and tired, she (<font color='blue'><b>sister</b></font>) persisted in riding on the sled. She (<font color='blue'><b>sister</b></font>)
was pretty and soft, but she (<font color='blue'><b>sister</b></font>) weighed one hundred and twenty pounds--a
lusty last straw to the load dragged by the weak and starving animals.
She (<font color='blue'><b>sister</b></font>) rode for days, till they fell in the traces and the sled stood
still. Charles and Hal begged her (<font color='blue'><b>sister</b></font>) to get off and walk, pleaded with her (<font color='blue'><b>sister</b></font>),
entreated, the while she (<font color='blue'><b>sister</b></font>) wept and importuned Heaven with a recital of
their brutality.

<p/>On one occasion they took her (<font color='blue'><b>sister</b></font>) off the sled by main strength. They never
did it again. She (<font color='blue'><b>sister</b></font>) let her (<font color='blue'><b>sister</b></font>) legs go limp like a spoiled child, and sat
down on the trail. They went on their way, but she (<font color='blue'><b>sister</b></font>) did not move. After
they had travelled three miles they unloaded the sled, came back for
her (<font color='blue'><b>sister</b></font>), and by main strength put her (<font color='blue'><b>sister</b></font>) on the sled again.

<p/>In the excess of their own misery they were callous to the suffering of
their animals. Hal's theory, which he (<font color='blue'><b>Hal</b></font>) practised on others, was that one
must get hardened. He (<font color='blue'><b>Hal</b></font>) had started out preaching it to his (<font color='blue'><b>Hal</b></font>) sister and
brother-in-law. Failing there, he (<font color='blue'><b>Hal</b></font>) hammered it into the dogs with a club.
At the Five Fingers the dog-food gave out, and a toothless old squaw
offered to trade them a few pounds of frozen horse-hide for the Colt's
revolver that kept the big hunting-knife company at Hal's hip. A poor
substitute for food was this hide, just as it had been stripped from the
starved horses of the cattlemen six months back. In its frozen state it
was more like strips of galvanized iron, and when a dog wrestled it into
his (<font color='blue'><b>Hal</b></font>) stomach it thawed into thin and innutritious leathery strings and
into a mass of short hair, irritating and indigestible.

<p/>And through it all Buck staggered along at the head of the team as in
a nightmare. He (<font color='blue'><b>Buck</b></font>) pulled when he (<font color='blue'><b>Buck</b></font>) could; when he (<font color='blue'><b>Buck</b></font>) could no longer pull, he (<font color='blue'><b>Buck</b></font>)
fell down and remained down till blows from whip or club drove him (<font color='blue'><b>Buck</b></font>)
to his (<font color='blue'><b>Buck</b></font>) feet again. All the stiffness and gloss had gone out of his (<font color='blue'><b>Buck</b></font>)
beautiful furry coat. The hair hung down, limp and draggled, or matted
with dried blood where Hal's club had bruised him (<font color='blue'><b>Hal</b></font>). His (<font color='blue'><b>Hal</b></font>) muscles had
wasted away to knotty strings, and the flesh pads had disappeared, so
that each rib and every bone in his (<font color='blue'><b>Hal</b></font>) frame were outlined cleanly
through the loose hide that was wrinkled in folds of emptiness. It was
heartbreaking, only Buck's heart was unbreakable. The man in the red
sweater had proved that.

<p/>As it was with Buck, so was it with his (<font color='blue'><b>Buck</b></font>) mates. They were perambulating
skeletons. There were seven all together, including him (<font color='blue'><b>Buck</b></font>). In their very
great misery they had become insensible to the bite of the lash or the
bruise of the club. The pain of the beating was dull and distant,
just as the things their eyes saw and their ears heard seemed dull and
distant. They were not half living, or quarter living. They were simply
so many bags of bones in which sparks of life fluttered faintly. When a
halt was made, they dropped down in the traces like dead dogs, and the
spark dimmed and paled and seemed to go out. And when the club or whip
fell upon them, the spark fluttered feebly up, and they tottered to
their feet and staggered on.

<p/>There came a day when Billee, the good-natured, fell and could not rise.
Hal had traded off his (<font color='blue'><b>Hal</b></font>) revolver, so he (<font color='blue'><b>Hal</b></font>) took the axe and knocked Billee
on the head as he (<font color='blue'><b>Hal</b></font>) lay in the traces, then cut the carcass out of the
harness and dragged it to one side. Buck saw, and his (<font color='blue'><b>Buck</b></font>) mates saw, and
they knew that this thing was very close to them. On the next day Koona
went, and but five of them remained: Joe, too far gone to be malignant;
Pike, crippled and limping, only half conscious and not conscious enough
longer to malinger; Sol-leks, the one-eyed, still faithful to the toil
of trace and trail, and mournful in that he (<font color='blue'><b>Joe</b></font>) had so little strength with
which to pull; Teek, who had not travelled so far that winter and who
was now beaten more than the others because he (<font color='blue'><b>Joe</b></font>) was fresher; and Buck,
still at the head of the team, but no longer enforcing discipline or
striving to enforce it, blind with weakness half the time and keeping
the trail by the loom of it and by the dim feel of his (<font color='blue'><b>Buck</b></font>) feet.

<p/>It was beautiful spring weather, but neither dogs nor humans were aware
of it. Each day the sun rose earlier and set later. It was dawn by three
in the morning, and twilight lingered till nine at night. The whole long
day was a blaze of sunshine. The ghostly winter silence had given way
to the great spring murmur of awakening life. This murmur arose from all
the land, fraught with the joy of living. It came from the things that
lived and moved again, things which had been as dead and which had not
moved during the long months of frost. The sap was rising in the pines.
The willows and aspens were bursting out in young buds. Shrubs and vines
were putting on fresh garbs of green. Crickets sang in the nights, and
in the days all manner of creeping, crawling things rustled forth into
the sun. Partridges and woodpeckers were booming and knocking in the
forest. Squirrels were chattering, birds singing, and overhead honked
the wild-fowl driving up from the south in cunning wedges that split the
air.

<p/>From every hill slope came the trickle of running water, the music of
unseen fountains. All things were thawing, bending, snapping. The Yukon
was straining to break loose the ice that bound it down. It ate away
from beneath; the sun ate from above. Air-holes formed, fissures sprang
and spread apart, while thin sections of ice fell through bodily into
the river. And amid all this bursting, rending, throbbing of awakening
life, under the blazing sun and through the soft-sighing breezes, like
wayfarers to death, staggered the two men, the woman, and the huskies.

<p/>With the dogs falling, Mercedes weeping and riding, Hal swearing
innocuously, and Charles's eyes wistfully watering, they staggered into
John Thornton's camp at the mouth of White River. When they halted,
the dogs dropped down as though they had all been struck dead. Mercedes
dried her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) eyes and looked at John Thornton. Charles sat down on a log
to rest. He (<font color='blue'><b>Charles</b></font>) sat down very slowly and painstakingly what of his (<font color='blue'><b>Charles</b></font>) great
stiffness. Hal did the talking. John Thornton was whittling the last
touches on an axe-handle he (<font color='blue'><b>Thornton</b></font>) had made from a stick of birch. He (<font color='blue'><b>Thornton</b></font>) whittled
and listened, gave monosyllabic replies, and, when it was asked, terse
advice. He (<font color='blue'><b>Thornton</b></font>) knew the breed, and he (<font color='blue'><b>Thornton</b></font>) gave his (<font color='blue'><b>Thornton</b></font>) advice in the certainty that
it would not be followed.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``They told us up above that the bottom was dropping out of the trail and
that the best thing for us to do was to lay over,''  (<font color='red'><b>Hal</b></font>)</div>Hal said in response
to Thornton's warning to take no more chances on the rotten ice. <div class="bookquote">``They
told us we couldn't make White River, and here we are.''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>This last with a
sneering ring of triumph in it.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``And they told you true,''  (<font color='red'><b>Thornton/John Thornton/John</b></font>)</div>John Thornton answered. <div class="bookquote">``The bottom's likely
to drop out at any moment. Only fools, with the blind luck of fools,
could have made it. I tell you straight, I wouldn't risk my carcass on
that ice for all the gold in Alaska.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``That's because you're not a fool, I suppose,''  (<font color='red'><b>Hal</b></font>)</div>said Hal. <div class="bookquote">``All the same,
we'll go on to Dawson.''  (<font color='red'><b>He</b></font>)</div>He (<font color='blue'><b>Hal</b></font>) uncoiled his (<font color='blue'><b>Hal</b></font>) whip. <div class="bookquote">``Get up there, Buck! Hi!
Get up there! Mush on!''

 (<font color='red'><b>Thornton/John Thornton/John</b></font>)</div><p/>Thornton went on whittling. It was idle, he (<font color='blue'><b>Thornton</b></font>) knew, to get between a fool
and his (<font color='blue'><b>Thornton</b></font>) folly; while two or three fools more or less would not alter the
scheme of things.

<p/>But the team did not get up at the command. It had long since passed
into the stage where blows were required to rouse it. The whip flashed
out, here and there, on its merciless errands. John Thornton compressed
his (<font color='blue'><b>Thornton</b></font>) lips. Sol-leks was the first to crawl to his (<font color='blue'><b>Thornton</b></font>) feet. Teek followed.
Joe came next, yelping with pain. Pike made painful efforts. Twice he (<font color='blue'><b>Joe</b></font>)
fell over, when half up, and on the third attempt managed to rise. Buck
made no effort. He (<font color='blue'><b>Buck</b></font>) lay quietly where he (<font color='blue'><b>Buck</b></font>) had fallen. The lash bit into
him (<font color='blue'><b>Buck</b></font>) again and again, but he (<font color='blue'><b>Buck</b></font>) neither whined nor struggled. Several times
Thornton started, as though to speak, but changed his (<font color='blue'><b>Thornton</b></font>) mind. A moisture
came into his (<font color='blue'><b>Thornton</b></font>) eyes, and, as the whipping continued, he (<font color='blue'><b>Thornton</b></font>) arose and walked
irresolutely up and down.

<p/>This was the first time Buck had failed, in itself a sufficient reason
to drive Hal into a rage. He (<font color='blue'><b>Hal</b></font>) exchanged the whip for the customary club.
Buck refused to move under the rain of heavier blows which now fell upon
him (<font color='blue'><b>Buck</b></font>). Like his (<font color='blue'><b>Buck</b></font>) mates, he (<font color='blue'><b>Buck</b></font>) was barely able to get up, but, unlike them, he (<font color='blue'><b>Buck</b></font>)
had made up his (<font color='blue'><b>Buck</b></font>) mind not to get up. He (<font color='blue'><b>Buck</b></font>) had a vague feeling of impending
doom. This had been strong upon him (<font color='blue'><b>Buck</b></font>) when he (<font color='blue'><b>Buck</b></font>) pulled in to the bank, and
it had not departed from him (<font color='blue'><b>Buck</b></font>). What of the thin and rotten ice he (<font color='blue'><b>Buck</b></font>) had
felt under his (<font color='blue'><b>Buck</b></font>) feet all day, it seemed that he (<font color='blue'><b>Buck</b></font>) sensed disaster close at
hand, out there ahead on the ice where his (<font color='blue'><b>Buck</b></font>) master was trying to drive
him (<font color='blue'><b>Buck</b></font>). He (<font color='blue'><b>Buck</b></font>) refused to stir. So greatly had he (<font color='blue'><b>Buck</b></font>) suffered, and so far gone was
he (<font color='blue'><b>Buck</b></font>), that the blows did not hurt much. And as they continued to fall upon
him (<font color='blue'><b>Buck</b></font>), the spark of life within flickered and went down. It was nearly
out. He (<font color='blue'><b>Buck</b></font>) felt strangely numb. As though from a great distance, he (<font color='blue'><b>Buck</b></font>) was
aware that he (<font color='blue'><b>Buck</b></font>) was being beaten. The last sensations of pain left him (<font color='blue'><b>Buck</b></font>). He (<font color='blue'><b>Buck</b></font>)
no longer felt anything, though very faintly he (<font color='blue'><b>Buck</b></font>) could hear the impact of
the club upon his (<font color='blue'><b>Buck</b></font>) body. But it was no longer his (<font color='blue'><b>Buck</b></font>) body, it seemed so far
away.

<p/>And then, suddenly, without warning, uttering a cry that was
inarticulate and more like the cry of an animal, John Thornton sprang
upon the man who wielded the club. Hal was hurled backward, as
though struck by a falling tree. Mercedes screamed. Charles looked on
wistfully, wiped his (<font color='blue'><b>Charles</b></font>) watery eyes, but did not get up because of his (<font color='blue'><b>Charles</b></font>)
stiffness.

<p/>John Thornton stood over Buck, struggling to control himself, too
convulsed with rage to speak.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``If you strike that dog again, I'll kill you,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Thornton</b></font>) at last managed to say
in a choking voice.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``It's my dog,''  (<font color='red'><b>Hal</b></font>)</div>Hal replied, wiping the blood from his (<font color='blue'><b>Hal</b></font>) mouth as he (<font color='blue'><b>Hal</b></font>) came
back. <div class="bookquote">``Get out of my way, or I'll fix you. I'm going to Dawson.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Thornton/John Thornton/John</b></font>)</div><p/>Thornton stood between him (<font color='blue'><b>Thornton</b></font>) and Buck, and evinced no intention of getting
out of the way. Hal drew his (<font color='blue'><b>Hal</b></font>) long hunting-knife. Mercedes screamed,
cried, laughed, and manifested the chaotic abandonment of hysteria.
Thornton rapped Hal's knuckles with the axe-handle, knocking the knife
to the ground. He (<font color='blue'><b>Thornton</b></font>) rapped his (<font color='blue'><b>Thornton</b></font>) knuckles again as he (<font color='blue'><b>Thornton</b></font>) tried to pick it up.
Then he (<font color='blue'><b>Thornton</b></font>) stooped, picked it up himself, and with two strokes cut Buck's
traces.

<p/>Hal had no fight left in him (<font color='blue'><b>Hal</b></font>). Besides, his (<font color='blue'><b>Hal</b></font>) hands were full with his (<font color='blue'><b>Hal</b></font>)
sister, or his (<font color='blue'><b>Hal</b></font>) arms, rather; while Buck was too near dead to be of
further use in hauling the sled. A few minutes later they pulled out
from the bank and down the river. Buck heard them go and raised his (<font color='blue'><b>Buck</b></font>) head
to see, Pike was leading, Sol-leks was at the wheel, and between were
Joe and Teek. They were limping and staggering. Mercedes was riding the
loaded sled. Hal guided at the gee-pole, and Charles stumbled along in
the rear.

<p/>As Buck watched them, Thornton knelt beside him (<font color='blue'><b>Thornton</b></font>) and with rough, kindly
hands searched for broken bones. By the time his (<font color='blue'><b>Thornton</b></font>) search had disclosed
nothing more than many bruises and a state of terrible starvation, the
sled was a quarter of a mile away. Dog and man watched it crawling along
over the ice. Suddenly, they saw its back end drop down, as into a rut,
and the gee-pole, with Hal clinging to it, jerk into the air. Mercedes's
scream came to their ears. They saw Charles turn and make one step to
run back, and then a whole section of ice give way and dogs and humans
disappear. A yawning hole was all that was to be seen. The bottom had
dropped out of the trail.

<p/>John Thornton and Buck looked at each other.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``You poor devil,''  (<font color='red'><b>Thornton/John Thornton/John</b></font>)</div>said John Thornton, and Buck licked his (<font color='blue'><b>Thornton</b></font>) hand.




<p/>Chapter VI. For the Love of a Man


<p/>When John Thornton froze his (<font color='blue'><b>Thornton</b></font>) feet in the previous December his (<font color='blue'><b>Thornton</b></font>) partners
had made him (<font color='blue'><b>Thornton</b></font>) comfortable and left him (<font color='blue'><b>Thornton</b></font>) to get well, going on themselves
up the river to get out a raft of saw-logs for Dawson. He (<font color='blue'><b>Dawson</b></font>) was still
limping slightly at the time he (<font color='blue'><b>Dawson</b></font>) rescued Buck, but with the continued
warm weather even the slight limp left him (<font color='blue'><b>Buck</b></font>). And here, lying by the river
bank through the long spring days, watching the running water, listening
lazily to the songs of birds and the hum of nature, Buck slowly won back
his (<font color='blue'><b>Buck</b></font>) strength.

<p/>A rest comes very good after one has travelled three thousand miles,
and it must be confessed that Buck waxed lazy as his (<font color='blue'><b>Buck</b></font>) wounds healed, his (<font color='blue'><b>Buck</b></font>)
muscles swelled out, and the flesh came back to cover his (<font color='blue'><b>Buck</b></font>) bones. For
that matter, they were all loafing,--Buck, John Thornton, and Skeet
and Nig,--waiting for the raft to come that was to carry them down to
Dawson. Skeet was a little Irish setter who early made friends with
Buck, who, in a dying condition, was unable to resent her (<font color='blue'><b>setter</b></font>) first
advances. She (<font color='blue'><b>setter</b></font>) had the doctor trait which some dogs possess; and as a
mother cat washes her (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) kittens, so she (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) washed and cleansed Buck's
wounds. Regularly, each morning after he (<font color='blue'><b>Buck</b></font>) had finished his (<font color='blue'><b>Buck</b></font>) breakfast,
she (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) performed her (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) self-appointed task, till he (<font color='blue'><b>Buck</b></font>) came to look for her (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>)
ministrations as much as he (<font color='blue'><b>Buck</b></font>) did for Thornton's. Nig, equally friendly,
though less demonstrative, was a huge black dog, half bloodhound and
half deerhound, with eyes that laughed and a boundless good nature.

<p/>To Buck's surprise these dogs manifested no jealousy toward him (<font color='blue'><b>Buck</b></font>). They
seemed to share the kindliness and largeness of John Thornton. As Buck
grew stronger they enticed him (<font color='blue'><b>Buck</b></font>) into all sorts of ridiculous games, in
which Thornton himself could not forbear to join; and in this fashion
Buck romped through his (<font color='blue'><b>Buck</b></font>) convalescence and into a new existence. Love,
genuine passionate love, was his (<font color='blue'><b>Buck</b></font>) for the first time. This he (<font color='blue'><b>Buck</b></font>) had never
experienced at Judge Miller's down in the sun-kissed Santa Clara Valley.
With the Judge's sons, hunting and tramping, it had been a working
partnership; with the Judge's grandsons, a sort of pompous guardianship;
and with the Judge himself, a stately and dignified friendship. But love
that was feverish and burning, that was adoration, that was madness, it
had taken John Thornton to arouse.

<p/>This man had saved his (<font color='blue'><b>Thornton</b></font>) life, which was something; but, further, he (<font color='blue'><b>Thornton</b></font>) was
the ideal master. Other men saw to the welfare of their dogs from a
sense of duty and business expediency; he (<font color='blue'><b>Thornton</b></font>) saw to the welfare of his (<font color='blue'><b>Thornton</b></font>) as
if they were his (<font color='blue'><b>Thornton</b></font>) own children, because he (<font color='blue'><b>Thornton</b></font>) could not help it. And he (<font color='blue'><b>Thornton</b></font>) saw
further. He (<font color='blue'><b>Thornton</b></font>) never forgot a kindly greeting or a cheering word, and to
sit down for a long talk with them -LRB-<div class="bookquote">``gas''  (<font color='red'><b>He</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Thornton</b></font>) called it-RRB- was as much his (<font color='blue'><b>Thornton</b></font>)
delight as theirs. He (<font color='blue'><b>Thornton</b></font>) had a way of taking Buck's head roughly between
his (<font color='blue'><b>Buck</b></font>) hands, and resting his (<font color='blue'><b>Buck</b></font>) own head upon Buck's, of shaking him (<font color='blue'><b>Buck</b></font>) back
and forth, the while calling him (<font color='blue'><b>Buck</b></font>) ill names that to Buck were love
names. Buck knew no greater joy than that rough embrace and the sound of
murmured oaths, and at each jerk back and forth it seemed that his (<font color='blue'><b>Buck</b></font>) heart
would be shaken out of his (<font color='blue'><b>Buck</b></font>) body so great was its ecstasy. And when,
released, he (<font color='blue'><b>Buck</b></font>) sprang to his (<font color='blue'><b>Buck</b></font>) feet, his (<font color='blue'><b>Buck</b></font>) mouth laughing, his (<font color='blue'><b>Buck</b></font>) eyes eloquent,
his (<font color='blue'><b>Buck</b></font>) throat vibrant with unuttered sound, and in that fashion remained
without movement, John Thornton would reverently exclaim, <div class="bookquote">``God! you can
all but speak!''

 (<font color='red'><b>Thornton/John Thornton/John</b></font>)</div><p/>Buck had a trick of love expression that was akin to hurt. He (<font color='blue'><b>Buck</b></font>) would
often seize Thornton's hand in his (<font color='blue'><b>Buck</b></font>) mouth and close so fiercely that the
flesh bore the impress of his (<font color='blue'><b>Buck</b></font>) teeth for some time afterward. And as
Buck understood the oaths to be love words, so the man understood this
feigned bite for a caress.

<p/>For the most part, however, Buck's love was expressed in adoration.
While he (<font color='blue'><b>Buck</b></font>) went wild with happiness when Thornton touched him (<font color='blue'><b>Thornton</b></font>) or spoke to
him (<font color='blue'><b>Thornton</b></font>), he (<font color='blue'><b>Thornton</b></font>) did not seek these tokens. Unlike Skeet, who was wont to shove
her (<font color='blue'><b>Buck</b></font>) nose under Thornton's hand and nudge and nudge till petted, or Nig,
who would stalk up and rest his (<font color='blue'><b>Thornton</b></font>) great head on Thornton's knee, Buck was
content to adore at a distance. He (<font color='blue'><b>Buck</b></font>) would lie by the hour, eager, alert,
at Thornton's feet, looking up into his (<font color='blue'><b>Thornton</b></font>) face, dwelling upon it, studying
it, following with keenest interest each fleeting expression, every
movement or change of feature. Or, as chance might have it, he (<font color='blue'><b>Thornton</b></font>) would lie
farther away, to the side or rear, watching the outlines of the man and
the occasional movements of his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) body. And often, such was the communion
in which they lived, the strength of Buck's gaze would draw John
Thornton's head around, and he (<font color='blue'><b>Thornton</b></font>) would return the gaze, without speech,
his (<font color='blue'><b>Thornton</b></font>) heart shining out of his (<font color='blue'><b>Thornton</b></font>) eyes as Buck's heart shone out.

<p/>For a long time after his (<font color='blue'><b>Buck</b></font>) rescue, Buck did not like Thornton to get out
of his (<font color='blue'><b>Buck</b></font>) sight. From the moment he (<font color='blue'><b>Buck</b></font>) left the tent to when he (<font color='blue'><b>Buck</b></font>) entered it
again, Buck would follow at his (<font color='blue'><b>Buck</b></font>) heels. His (<font color='blue'><b>Buck</b></font>) transient masters since he (<font color='blue'><b>Buck</b></font>)
had come into the Northland had bred in him (<font color='blue'><b>Buck</b></font>) a fear that no master could
be permanent. He (<font color='blue'><b>master</b></font>) was afraid that Thornton would pass out of his (<font color='blue'><b>Thornton</b></font>) life as
Perrault and Francois and the Scotch half-breed had passed out. Even in
the night, in his (<font color='blue'><b>Thornton</b></font>) dreams, he (<font color='blue'><b>Thornton</b></font>) was haunted by this fear. At such times
he (<font color='blue'><b>Thornton</b></font>) would shake off sleep and creep through the chill to the flap of
the tent, where he (<font color='blue'><b>Thornton</b></font>) would stand and listen to the sound of his (<font color='blue'><b>Thornton</b></font>) master's
breathing.

<p/>But in spite of this great love he (<font color='blue'><b>Thornton</b></font>) bore John Thornton, which seemed
to bespeak the soft civilizing influence, the strain of the primitive,
which the Northland had aroused in him (<font color='blue'><b>Thornton</b></font>), remained alive and active.
Faithfulness and devotion, things born of fire and roof, were his (<font color='blue'><b>Thornton</b></font>); yet
he (<font color='blue'><b>Thornton</b></font>) retained his (<font color='blue'><b>Thornton</b></font>) wildness and wiliness. He (<font color='blue'><b>Thornton</b></font>) was a thing of the wild, come
in from the wild to sit by John Thornton's fire, rather than a dog
of the soft Southland stamped with the marks of generations of
civilization. Because of his (<font color='blue'><b>Thornton</b></font>) very great love, he (<font color='blue'><b>Thornton</b></font>) could not steal from
this man, but from any other man, in any other camp, he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) did not hesitate
an instant; while the cunning with which he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) stole enabled him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) to escape
detection.

<p/>His (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) face and body were scored by the teeth of many dogs, and he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>)
fought as fiercely as ever and more shrewdly. Skeet and Nig were too
good-natured for quarrelling,--besides, they belonged to John Thornton;
but the strange dog, no matter what the breed or valor, swiftly
acknowledged Buck's supremacy or found himself struggling for life with
a terrible antagonist. And Buck was merciless. He (<font color='blue'><b>Buck</b></font>) had learned well the
law of club and fang, and he (<font color='blue'><b>Buck</b></font>) never forewent an advantage or drew back
from a foe he (<font color='blue'><b>Buck</b></font>) had started on the way to Death. He (<font color='blue'><b>Buck</b></font>) had lessoned from
Spitz, and from the chief fighting dogs of the police and mail, and knew
there was no middle course. He (<font color='blue'><b>Buck</b></font>) must master or be mastered; while to show
mercy was a weakness. Mercy did not exist in the primordial life. It was
misunderstood for fear, and such misunderstandings made for death. Kill
or be killed, eat or be eaten, was the law; and this mandate, down out
of the depths of Time, he (<font color='blue'><b>Buck</b></font>) obeyed.

<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Buck</b></font>) was older than the days he (<font color='blue'><b>Buck</b></font>) had seen and the breaths he (<font color='blue'><b>Buck</b></font>) had drawn. He (<font color='blue'><b>Buck</b></font>)
linked the past with the present, and the eternity behind him (<font color='blue'><b>Buck</b></font>) throbbed
through him (<font color='blue'><b>Buck</b></font>) in a mighty rhythm to which he (<font color='blue'><b>Buck</b></font>) swayed as the tides and
seasons swayed. He (<font color='blue'><b>Buck</b></font>) sat by John Thornton's fire, a broad-breasted dog,
white-fanged and long-furred; but behind him (<font color='blue'><b>Thornton</b></font>) were the shades of all
manner of dogs, half-wolves and wild wolves, urgent and prompting,
tasting the savor of the meat he (<font color='blue'><b>Thornton</b></font>) ate, thirsting for the water he (<font color='blue'><b>Thornton</b></font>) drank,
scenting the wind with him (<font color='blue'><b>Thornton</b></font>), listening with him (<font color='blue'><b>Thornton</b></font>) and telling him (<font color='blue'><b>Thornton</b></font>) the
sounds made by the wild life in the forest, dictating his (<font color='blue'><b>Thornton</b></font>) moods,
directing his (<font color='blue'><b>Thornton</b></font>) actions, lying down to sleep with him (<font color='blue'><b>Thornton</b></font>) when he (<font color='blue'><b>Thornton</b></font>) lay down,
and dreaming with him (<font color='blue'><b>Thornton</b></font>) and beyond him (<font color='blue'><b>Thornton</b></font>) and becoming themselves the stuff
of his (<font color='blue'><b>Thornton</b></font>) dreams.

<p/>So peremptorily did these shades beckon him (<font color='blue'><b>Thornton</b></font>), that each day mankind and
the claims of mankind slipped farther from him (<font color='blue'><b>Thornton</b></font>). Deep in the forest a
call was sounding, and as often as he (<font color='blue'><b>Thornton</b></font>) heard this call, mysteriously
thrilling and luring, he (<font color='blue'><b>Thornton</b></font>) felt compelled to turn his (<font color='blue'><b>Thornton</b></font>) back upon the fire
and the beaten earth around it, and to plunge into the forest, and on
and on, he (<font color='blue'><b>Thornton</b></font>) knew not where or why; nor did he (<font color='blue'><b>Thornton</b></font>) wonder where or why, the
call sounding imperiously, deep in the forest. But as often as he (<font color='blue'><b>Thornton</b></font>) gained
the soft unbroken earth and the green shade, the love for John Thornton
drew him (<font color='blue'><b>Thornton</b></font>) back to the fire again.

<p/>Thornton alone held him (<font color='blue'><b>Thornton</b></font>). The rest of mankind was as nothing. Chance
travellers might praise or pet him (<font color='blue'><b>Thornton</b></font>); but he (<font color='blue'><b>Thornton</b></font>) was cold under it all,
and from a too demonstrative man he (<font color='blue'><b>Thornton</b></font>) would get up and walk away. When
Thornton's partners, Hans and Pete, arrived on the long-expected raft,
Buck refused to notice them till he (<font color='blue'><b>Buck</b></font>) learned they were close to Thornton;
after that he (<font color='blue'><b>Thornton</b></font>) tolerated them in a passive sort of way, accepting favors
from them as though he (<font color='blue'><b>Thornton</b></font>) favored them by accepting. They were of the same
large type as Thornton, living close to the earth, thinking simply and
seeing clearly; and ere they swung the raft into the big eddy by the
saw-mill at Dawson, they understood Buck and his (<font color='blue'><b>Buck</b></font>) ways, and did not
insist upon an intimacy such as obtained with Skeet and Nig.

<p/>For Thornton, however, his (<font color='blue'><b>Thornton</b></font>) love seemed to grow and grow. He (<font color='blue'><b>Thornton</b></font>), alone among
men, could put a pack upon Buck's back in the summer travelling. Nothing
was too great for Buck to do, when Thornton commanded. One day -LRB-they had
grub-staked themselves from the proceeds of the raft and left Dawson
for the head-waters of the Tanana-RRB- the men and dogs were sitting on the
crest of a cliff which fell away, straight down, to naked bed-rock three
hundred feet below. John Thornton was sitting near the edge, Buck at his (<font color='blue'><b>Thornton</b></font>)
shoulder. A thoughtless whim seized Thornton, and he (<font color='blue'><b>Thornton</b></font>) drew the attention
of Hans and Pete to the experiment he (<font color='blue'><b>Pete</b></font>) had in mind. <div class="bookquote">``Jump, Buck!''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Pete</b></font>)
commanded, sweeping his (<font color='blue'><b>Pete</b></font>) arm out and over the chasm. The next instant he (<font color='blue'><b>Pete</b></font>)
was grappling with Buck on the extreme edge, while Hans and Pete were
dragging them back into safety.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``It's uncanny,''  (<font color='red'><b>Pete</b></font>)</div>Pete said, after it was over and they had caught their
speech.

<p/>Thornton shook his (<font color='blue'><b>Thornton</b></font>) head. <div class="bookquote">``No, it is splendid, and it is terrible, too.
Do you know, it sometimes makes me afraid.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I'm not hankering to be the man that lays hands on you while he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>)'s
around,''  (<font color='red'><b>Pete</b></font>)</div>Pete announced conclusively, nodding his (<font color='blue'><b>Thornton</b></font>) head toward Buck.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Py Jingo!''  (<font color='red'><b>Hans</b></font>)</div>was Hans's contribution. <div class="bookquote">``Not mineself either.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Pete</b></font>)</div><p/>It was at Circle City, ere the year was out, that Pete's apprehensions
were realized. <div class="bookquote">``Black''  (<font color='red'><b>Burton</b></font>)</div>Burton, a man evil-tempered and malicious, had
been picking a quarrel with a tenderfoot at the bar, when Thornton
stepped good-naturedly between. Buck, as was his (<font color='blue'><b>Buck</b></font>) custom, was lying in a
corner, head on paws, watching his (<font color='blue'><b>Buck</b></font>) master's every action. Burton struck
out, without warning, straight from the shoulder. Thornton was sent
spinning, and saved himself from falling only by clutching the rail of
the bar.

<p/>Those who were looking on heard what was neither bark nor yelp, but a
something which is best described as a roar, and they saw Buck's body
rise up in the air as he (<font color='blue'><b>Buck</b></font>) left the floor for Burton's throat. The man
saved his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) life by instinctively throwing out his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) arm, but was hurled
backward to the floor with Buck on top of him (<font color='blue'><b>Buck</b></font>). Buck loosed his (<font color='blue'><b>Buck</b></font>) teeth
from the flesh of the arm and drove in again for the throat. This time
the man succeeded only in partly blocking, and his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) throat was torn open.
Then the crowd was upon Buck, and he (<font color='blue'><b>Buck</b></font>) was driven off; but while a surgeon
checked the bleeding, he (<font color='blue'><b>Buck</b></font>) prowled up and down, growling furiously,
attempting to rush in, and being forced back by an array of hostile
clubs. A <div class="bookquote">``miners' meeting,''  (<font color='red'><b>the dog</b></font>)</div>called on the spot, decided that the dog had
sufficient provocation, and Buck was discharged. But his (<font color='blue'><b>Buck</b></font>) reputation was
made, and from that day his (<font color='blue'><b>Buck</b></font>) name spread through every camp in Alaska.

<p/>Later on, in the fall of the year, he (<font color='blue'><b>Buck</b></font>) saved John Thornton's life in
quite another fashion. The three partners were lining a long and narrow
poling-boat down a bad stretch of rapids on the Forty-Mile Creek. Hans
and Pete moved along the bank, snubbing with a thin Manila rope from
tree to tree, while Thornton remained in the boat, helping its descent
by means of a pole, and shouting directions to the shore. Buck, on the
bank, worried and anxious, kept abreast of the boat, his (<font color='blue'><b>Buck</b></font>) eyes never off
his (<font color='blue'><b>Buck</b></font>) master.

<p/>At a particularly bad spot, where a ledge of barely submerged rocks
jutted out into the river, Hans cast off the rope, and, while Thornton
poled the boat out into the stream, ran down the bank with the end in
his (<font color='blue'><b>Thornton</b></font>) hand to snub the boat when it had cleared the ledge. This it did,
and was flying down-stream in a current as swift as a mill-race, when
Hans checked it with the rope and checked too suddenly. The boat flirted
over and snubbed in to the bank bottom up, while Thornton, flung sheer
out of it, was carried down-stream toward the worst part of the rapids,
a stretch of wild water in which no swimmer could live.

<p/>Buck had sprung in on the instant; and at the end of three hundred
yards, amid a mad swirl of water, he (<font color='blue'><b>Buck</b></font>) overhauled Thornton. When he (<font color='blue'><b>Thornton</b></font>) felt
him (<font color='blue'><b>Thornton</b></font>) grasp his (<font color='blue'><b>Thornton</b></font>) tail, Buck headed for the bank, swimming with all his (<font color='blue'><b>Buck</b></font>)
splendid strength. But the progress shoreward was slow; the progress
down-stream amazingly rapid. From below came the fatal roaring where the
wild current went wilder and was rent in shreds and spray by the rocks
which thrust through like the teeth of an enormous comb. The suck of the
water as it took the beginning of the last steep pitch was frightful,
and Thornton knew that the shore was impossible. He (<font color='blue'><b>Thornton</b></font>) scraped furiously
over a rock, bruised across a second, and struck a third with crushing
force. He (<font color='blue'><b>Thornton</b></font>) clutched its slippery top with both hands, releasing Buck, and
above the roar of the churning water shouted: <div class="bookquote">``Go, Buck! Go!''

 (<font color='red'><b>Buck</b></font>)</div><p/>Buck could not hold his (<font color='blue'><b>Buck</b></font>) own, and swept on down-stream, struggling
desperately, but unable to win back. When he (<font color='blue'><b>Buck</b></font>) heard Thornton's command
repeated, he (<font color='blue'><b>Thornton</b></font>) partly reared out of the water, throwing his (<font color='blue'><b>Thornton</b></font>) head high, as
though for a last look, then turned obediently toward the bank. He (<font color='blue'><b>Thornton</b></font>) swam
powerfully and was dragged ashore by Pete and Hans at the very point
where swimming ceased to be possible and destruction began.

<p/>They knew that the time a man could cling to a slippery rock in the face
of that driving current was a matter of minutes, and they ran as fast as
they could up the bank to a point far above where Thornton was hanging
on. They attached the line with which they had been snubbing the boat to
Buck's neck and shoulders, being careful that it should neither strangle
him (<font color='blue'><b>Buck</b></font>) nor impede his (<font color='blue'><b>Buck</b></font>) swimming, and launched him (<font color='blue'><b>Buck</b></font>) into the stream. He (<font color='blue'><b>Buck</b></font>) struck
out boldly, but not straight enough into the stream. He (<font color='blue'><b>Buck</b></font>) discovered the
mistake too late, when Thornton was abreast of him (<font color='blue'><b>Thornton</b></font>) and a bare half-dozen
strokes away while he (<font color='blue'><b>Thornton</b></font>) was being carried helplessly past.

<p/>Hans promptly snubbed with the rope, as though Buck were a boat. The
rope thus tightening on him (<font color='blue'><b>Buck</b></font>) in the sweep of the current, he (<font color='blue'><b>Buck</b></font>) was jerked
under the surface, and under the surface he (<font color='blue'><b>Buck</b></font>) remained till his (<font color='blue'><b>Buck</b></font>) body
struck against the bank and he (<font color='blue'><b>Buck</b></font>) was hauled out. He (<font color='blue'><b>Buck</b></font>) was half drowned, and
Hans and Pete threw themselves upon him (<font color='blue'><b>Pete</b></font>), pounding the breath into him (<font color='blue'><b>Pete</b></font>)
and the water out of him (<font color='blue'><b>Pete</b></font>). He (<font color='blue'><b>Pete</b></font>) staggered to his (<font color='blue'><b>Pete</b></font>) feet and fell down. The
faint sound of Thornton's voice came to them, and though they could not
make out the words of it, they knew that he (<font color='blue'><b>Thornton</b></font>) was in his (<font color='blue'><b>Thornton</b></font>) extremity. His (<font color='blue'><b>Thornton</b></font>)
master's voice acted on Buck like an electric shock, He (<font color='blue'><b>Buck</b></font>) sprang to his (<font color='blue'><b>Buck</b></font>)
feet and ran up the bank ahead of the men to the point of his (<font color='blue'><b>Buck</b></font>) previous
departure.

<p/>Again the rope was attached and he (<font color='blue'><b>Buck</b></font>) was launched, and again he (<font color='blue'><b>Buck</b></font>) struck
out, but this time straight into the stream. He (<font color='blue'><b>Buck</b></font>) had miscalculated once,
but he (<font color='blue'><b>Buck</b></font>) would not be guilty of it a second time. Hans paid out the rope,
permitting no slack, while Pete kept it clear of coils. Buck held on
till he (<font color='blue'><b>Buck</b></font>) was on a line straight above Thornton; then he (<font color='blue'><b>Thornton</b></font>) turned, and with
the speed of an express train headed down upon him (<font color='blue'><b>Thornton</b></font>). Thornton saw him (<font color='blue'><b>Thornton</b></font>)
coming, and, as Buck struck him (<font color='blue'><b>Buck</b></font>) like a battering ram, with the whole
force of the current behind him (<font color='blue'><b>Buck</b></font>), he (<font color='blue'><b>Buck</b></font>) reached up and closed with both arms
around the shaggy neck. Hans snubbed the rope around the tree, and
Buck and Thornton were jerked under the water. Strangling, suffocating,
sometimes one uppermost and sometimes the other, dragging over the
jagged bottom, smashing against rocks and snags, they veered in to the
bank.

<p/>Thornton came to, belly downward and being violently propelled back
and forth across a drift log by Hans and Pete. His (<font color='blue'><b>Hans</b></font>) first glance was for
Buck, over whose limp and apparently lifeless body Nig was setting up a
howl, while Skeet was licking the wet face and closed eyes. Thornton was
himself bruised and battered, and he (<font color='blue'><b>Thornton</b></font>) went carefully over Buck's body,
when he (<font color='blue'><b>Buck</b></font>) had been brought around, finding three broken ribs.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``That settles it,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Buck</b></font>) announced. <div class="bookquote">``We camp right here.''  (<font color='red'><b>Buck</b></font>)</div>And camp they
did, till Buck's ribs knitted and he (<font color='blue'><b>Buck</b></font>) was able to travel.

<p/>That winter, at Dawson, Buck performed another exploit, not so heroic,
perhaps, but one that put his (<font color='blue'><b>Buck</b></font>) name many notches higher on the totem-pole
of Alaskan fame. This exploit was particularly gratifying to the three
men; for they stood in need of the outfit which it furnished, and were
enabled to make a long-desired trip into the virgin East, where miners
had not yet appeared. It was brought about by a conversation in the
Eldorado Saloon, in which men waxed boastful of their favorite dogs.
Buck, because of his (<font color='blue'><b>Buck</b></font>) record, was the target for these men, and Thornton
was driven stoutly to defend him (<font color='blue'><b>Thornton</b></font>). At the end of half an hour one man
stated that his (<font color='blue'><b>Thornton</b></font>) dog could start a sled with five hundred pounds and
walk off with it; a second bragged six hundred for his (<font color='blue'><b>Thornton</b></font>) dog; and a third,
seven hundred.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Pooh! pooh!''  (<font color='red'><b>Thornton/John Thornton/John</b></font>)</div>said John Thornton; <div class="bookquote">``Buck can start a thousand pounds.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Thornton/John Thornton/John</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``And break it out? and walk off with it for a hundred yards?''  (<font color='red'><b>Matthewson</b></font>)</div>demanded
Matthewson, a Bonanza King, he (<font color='blue'><b>Thornton</b></font>) of the seven hundred vaunt.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``And break it out, and walk off with it for a hundred yards,''  (<font color='red'><b>Thornton/John Thornton/John</b></font>)</div>John
Thornton said coolly.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Well,''  (<font color='red'><b>Matthewson</b></font>)</div>Matthewson said, slowly and deliberately, so that all could
hear, <div class="bookquote">``I've got a thousand dollars that says he (<font color='blue'><b>Buck</b></font>) can't. And there it
is.''  (<font color='red'><b>Matthewson</b></font>)</div>So saying, he (<font color='blue'><b>Thornton</b></font>) slammed a sack of gold dust of the size of a bologna
sausage down upon the bar.

<p/>Nobody spoke. Thornton's bluff, if bluff it was, had been called. He (<font color='blue'><b>Thornton</b></font>)
could feel a flush of warm blood creeping up his (<font color='blue'><b>Thornton</b></font>) face. His (<font color='blue'><b>Thornton</b></font>) tongue had
tricked him (<font color='blue'><b>Thornton</b></font>). He (<font color='blue'><b>Thornton</b></font>) did not know whether Buck could start a thousand pounds.
Half a ton! The enormousness of it appalled him (<font color='blue'><b>Buck</b></font>). He (<font color='blue'><b>Buck</b></font>) had great faith in
Buck's strength and had often thought him (<font color='blue'><b>Buck</b></font>) capable of starting such a
load; but never, as now, had he (<font color='blue'><b>Buck</b></font>) faced the possibility of it, the eyes
of a dozen men fixed upon him (<font color='blue'><b>Buck</b></font>), silent and waiting. Further, he (<font color='blue'><b>Buck</b></font>) had no
thousand dollars; nor had Hans or Pete.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``I've got a sled standing outside now, with twenty fiftypound sacks of
flour on it,''  (<font color='red'><b>Matthewson</b></font>)</div>Matthewson went on with brutal directness; <div class="bookquote">``so don't let
that hinder you.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Matthewson</b></font>)</div><p/>Thornton did not reply. He (<font color='blue'><b>Thornton</b></font>) did not know what to say. He (<font color='blue'><b>Thornton</b></font>) glanced from
face to face in the absent way of a man who has lost the power of
thought and is seeking somewhere to find the thing that will start
it going again. The face of Jim O``Brien, a Mastodon King and old-time
comrade, caught his (<font color='blue'><b>King</b></font>) eyes. It was as a cue to him (<font color='blue'><b>King</b></font>), seeming to rouse him (<font color='blue'><b>King</b></font>)
to do what he (<font color='blue'><b>King</b></font>) would never have dreamed of doing.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Can you lend me a thousand?''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Jim</b></font>) asked, almost in a whisper.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Sure,''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>answered O``Brien, thumping down a plethoric sack by the side of
Matthewson's. <div class="bookquote">``Though it's little faith I'm having, John, that the beast
can do the trick.''

 (<font color='red'><b>occupants</b></font>)</div><p/>The Eldorado emptied its occupants into the street to see the test. The
tables were deserted, and the dealers and gamekeepers came forth to see
the outcome of the wager and to lay odds. Several hundred men, furred
and mittened, banked around the sled within easy distance. Matthewson's
sled, loaded with a thousand pounds of flour, had been standing for a
couple of hours, and in the intense cold -LRB-it was sixty below zero-RRB- the
runners had frozen fast to the hard-packed snow. Men offered odds of two
to one that Buck could not budge the sled. A quibble arose concerning
the phrase <div class="bookquote">``break out.''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>O``Brien contended it was Thornton's privilege
to knock the runners loose, leaving Buck to <div class="bookquote">``break it out''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>from a dead
standstill. Matthewson insisted that the phrase included breaking the
runners from the frozen grip of the snow. A majority of the men who had
witnessed the making of the bet decided in his (<font color='blue'><b>Buck</b></font>) favor, whereat the odds
went up to three to one against Buck.

<p/>There were no takers. Not a man believed him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) capable of the feat.
Thornton had been hurried into the wager, heavy with doubt; and now that
he (<font color='blue'><b>Thornton</b></font>) looked at the sled itself, the concrete fact, with the regular team
of ten dogs curled up in the snow before it, the more impossible the
task appeared. Matthewson waxed jubilant.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Three to one!''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Thornton</b></font>) proclaimed. <div class="bookquote">``I'll lay you another thousand at that
figure, Thornton. What d'ye say?''

 (<font color='red'><b>Thornton/John Thornton/John</b></font>)</div><p/>Thornton's doubt was strong in his (<font color='blue'><b>Thornton</b></font>) face, but his (<font color='blue'><b>Thornton</b></font>) fighting spirit was
aroused--the fighting spirit that soars above odds, fails to recognize
the impossible, and is deaf to all save the clamor for battle. He (<font color='blue'><b>Thornton</b></font>) called
Hans and Pete to him (<font color='blue'><b>Thornton</b></font>). Their sacks were slim, and with his (<font color='blue'><b>Thornton</b></font>) own the three
partners could rake together only two hundred dollars. In the ebb of
their fortunes, this sum was their total capital; yet they laid it
unhesitatingly against Matthewson's six hundred.

<p/>The team of ten dogs was unhitched, and Buck, with his (<font color='blue'><b>Buck</b></font>) own harness, was
put into the sled. He (<font color='blue'><b>Buck</b></font>) had caught the contagion of the excitement, and
he (<font color='blue'><b>Buck</b></font>) felt that in some way he (<font color='blue'><b>Buck</b></font>) must do a great thing for John Thornton.
Murmurs of admiration at his (<font color='blue'><b>Thornton</b></font>) splendid appearance went up. He (<font color='blue'><b>Thornton</b></font>) was in
perfect condition, without an ounce of superfluous flesh, and the one
hundred and fifty pounds that he (<font color='blue'><b>Thornton</b></font>) weighed were so many pounds of grit and
virility. His (<font color='blue'><b>Thornton</b></font>) furry coat shone with the sheen of silk. Down the neck and
across the shoulders, his (<font color='blue'><b>Thornton</b></font>) mane, in repose as it was, half bristled and
seemed to lift with every movement, as though excess of vigor made each
particular hair alive and active. The great breast and heavy fore legs
were no more than in proportion with the rest of the body, where the
muscles showed in tight rolls underneath the skin. Men felt these
muscles and proclaimed them hard as iron, and the odds went down to two
to one.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Gad, sir! Gad, sir!''  (<font color='red'><b>a member</b></font>)</div>stuttered a member of the latest dynasty, a king
of the Skookum Benches. <div class="bookquote">``I offer you eight hundred for him (<font color='blue'><b>Thornton</b></font>), sir, before
the test, sir; eight hundred just as he (<font color='blue'><b>Thornton</b></font>) stands.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Thornton/John Thornton/John</b></font>)</div><p/>Thornton shook his (<font color='blue'><b>Thornton</b></font>) head and stepped to Buck's side.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``You must stand off from him (<font color='blue'><b>Thornton</b></font>),''  (<font color='red'><b>Matthewson</b></font>)</div>Matthewson protested. <div class="bookquote">``Free play and
plenty of room.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/>The crowd fell silent; only could be heard the voices of the gamblers
vainly offering two to one. Everybody acknowledged Buck a magnificent
animal, but twenty fifty-pound sacks of flour bulked too large in their
eyes for them to loosen their pouch-strings.

<p/>Thornton knelt down by Buck's side. He (<font color='blue'><b>Thornton</b></font>) took his (<font color='blue'><b>Thornton</b></font>) head in his (<font color='blue'><b>Thornton</b></font>) two hands
and rested cheek on cheek. He (<font color='blue'><b>Thornton</b></font>) did not playfully shake him (<font color='blue'><b>Thornton</b></font>), as was his (<font color='blue'><b>Thornton</b></font>)
wont, or murmur soft love curses; but he (<font color='blue'><b>Thornton</b></font>) whispered in his (<font color='blue'><b>Thornton</b></font>) ear. <div class="bookquote">``As you
love me, Buck. As you love me,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>was what he (<font color='blue'><b>Thornton</b></font>) whispered. Buck whined with
suppressed eagerness.

<p/>The crowd was watching curiously. The affair was growing mysterious. It
seemed like a conjuration. As Thornton got to his (<font color='blue'><b>Thornton</b></font>) feet, Buck seized his (<font color='blue'><b>Buck</b></font>)
mittened hand between his (<font color='blue'><b>Buck</b></font>) jaws, pressing in with his (<font color='blue'><b>Buck</b></font>) teeth and releasing
slowly, half-reluctantly. It was the answer, in terms, not of speech,
but of love. Thornton stepped well back.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Now, Buck,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Thornton</b></font>) said.

<p/>Buck tightened the traces, then slacked them for a matter of several
inches. It was the way he (<font color='blue'><b>Buck</b></font>) had learned.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Gee!''  (<font color='red'><b>Thornton/John Thornton/John</b></font>)</div>Thornton's voice rang out, sharp in the tense silence.

<p/>Buck swung to the right, ending the movement in a plunge that took up
the slack and with a sudden jerk arrested his (<font color='blue'><b>Buck</b></font>) one hundred and fifty
pounds. The load quivered, and from under the runners arose a crisp
crackling.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Haw!''  (<font color='red'><b>Thornton/John Thornton/John</b></font>)</div>Thornton commanded.

<p/>Buck duplicated the manoeuvre, this time to the left. The crackling
turned into a snapping, the sled pivoting and the runners slipping and
grating several inches to the side. The sled was broken out. Men were
holding their breaths, intensely unconscious of the fact.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Now, MUSH!''

 (<font color='red'><b>Thornton/John Thornton/John</b></font>)</div><p/>Thornton's command cracked out like a pistol-shot. Buck threw himself
forward, tightening the traces with a jarring lunge. His (<font color='blue'><b>Buck</b></font>) whole body
was gathered compactly together in the tremendous effort, the muscles
writhing and knotting like live things under the silky fur. His (<font color='blue'><b>Buck</b></font>) great
chest was low to the ground, his (<font color='blue'><b>Buck</b></font>) head forward and down, while his (<font color='blue'><b>Buck</b></font>)
feet were flying like mad, the claws scarring the hard-packed snow in
parallel grooves. The sled swayed and trembled, half-started forward.
One of his (<font color='blue'><b>Buck</b></font>) feet slipped, and one man groaned aloud. Then the sled
lurched ahead in what appeared a rapid succession of jerks, though it
never really came to a dead stop again...half an inch...an inch... two
inches... The jerks perceptibly diminished; as the sled gained momentum,
he (<font color='blue'><b>Buck</b></font>) caught them up, till it was moving steadily along.

<p/>Men gasped and began to breathe again, unaware that for a moment they
had ceased to breathe. Thornton was running behind, encouraging Buck
with short, cheery words. The distance had been measured off, and as he (<font color='blue'><b>Buck</b></font>)
neared the pile of firewood which marked the end of the hundred yards,
a cheer began to grow and grow, which burst into a roar as he (<font color='blue'><b>Buck</b></font>) passed
the firewood and halted at command. Every man was tearing himself loose,
even Matthewson. Hats and mittens were flying in the air. Men were
shaking hands, it did not matter with whom, and bubbling over in a
general incoherent babel.

<p/>But Thornton fell on his (<font color='blue'><b>Thornton</b></font>) knees beside Buck. Head was against head,
and he (<font color='blue'><b>Buck</b></font>) was shaking him (<font color='blue'><b>Buck</b></font>) back and forth. Those who hurried up heard him (<font color='blue'><b>Buck</b></font>)
cursing Buck, and he (<font color='blue'><b>Buck</b></font>) cursed him (<font color='blue'><b>Buck</b></font>) long and fervently, and softly and
lovingly.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Gad, sir! Gad, sir!''  (<font color='red'><b>the Skookum Bench king</b></font>)</div>spluttered the Skookum Bench king. <div class="bookquote">``I'll give you
a thousand for him (<font color='blue'><b>Buck</b></font>), sir, a thousand, sir--twelve hundred, sir.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Thornton/John Thornton/John</b></font>)</div><p/>Thornton rose to his (<font color='blue'><b>Thornton</b></font>) feet. His (<font color='blue'><b>Thornton</b></font>) eyes were wet. The tears were streaming
frankly down his (<font color='blue'><b>Thornton</b></font>) cheeks. <div class="bookquote">``Sir,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Thornton</b></font>) said to the Skookum Bench king, <div class="bookquote">``no,
sir. You can go to hell, sir. It's the best I can do for you, sir.''

 (<font color='red'><b>the Skookum Bench king</b></font>)</div><p/>Buck seized Thornton's hand in his (<font color='blue'><b>Buck</b></font>) teeth. Thornton shook him (<font color='blue'><b>Thornton</b></font>) back and
forth. As though animated by a common impulse, the onlookers drew back
to a respectful distance; nor were they again indiscreet enough to
interrupt.




<p/>Chapter VII. The Sounding of the Call


<p/>When Buck earned sixteen hundred dollars in five minutes for John
Thornton, he (<font color='blue'><b>Thornton</b></font>) made it possible for his (<font color='blue'><b>Thornton</b></font>) master to pay off certain debts
and to journey with his (<font color='blue'><b>Thornton</b></font>) partners into the East after a fabled lost mine,
the history of which was as old as the history of the country. Many men
had sought it; few had found it; and more than a few there were who had
never returned from the quest. This lost mine was steeped in tragedy and
shrouded in mystery. No one knew of the first man. The oldest tradition
stopped before it got back to him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>). From the beginning there had been an
ancient and ramshackle cabin. Dying men had sworn to it, and to the mine
the site of which it marked, clinching their testimony with nuggets that
were unlike any known grade of gold in the Northland.

<p/>But no living man had looted this treasure house, and the dead were
dead; wherefore John Thornton and Pete and Hans, with Buck and half a
dozen other dogs, faced into the East on an unknown trail to achieve
where men and dogs as good as themselves had failed. They sledded
seventy miles up the Yukon, swung to the left into the Stewart River,
passed the Mayo and the McQuestion, and held on until the Stewart itself
became a streamlet, threading the upstanding peaks which marked the
backbone of the continent.

<p/>John Thornton asked little of man or nature. He (<font color='blue'><b>Thornton</b></font>) was unafraid of the
wild. With a handful of salt and a rifle he (<font color='blue'><b>Thornton</b></font>) could plunge into the
wilderness and fare wherever he (<font color='blue'><b>Thornton</b></font>) pleased and as long as he (<font color='blue'><b>Thornton</b></font>) pleased. Being
in no haste, Indian fashion, he (<font color='blue'><b>Thornton</b></font>) hunted his (<font color='blue'><b>Thornton</b></font>) dinner in the course of the
day's travel; and if he (<font color='blue'><b>Thornton</b></font>) failed to find it, like the Indian, he (<font color='blue'><b>Indian</b></font>) kept on
travelling, secure in the knowledge that sooner or later he (<font color='blue'><b>Indian</b></font>) would come
to it. So, on this great journey into the East, straight meat was the
bill of fare, ammunition and tools principally made up the load on the
sled, and the time-card was drawn upon the limitless future.

<p/>To Buck it was boundless delight, this hunting, fishing, and indefinite
wandering through strange places. For weeks at a time they would hold
on steadily, day after day; and for weeks upon end they would camp, here
and there, the dogs loafing and the men burning holes through frozen
muck and gravel and washing countless pans of dirt by the heat of the
fire. Sometimes they went hungry, sometimes they feasted riotously, all
according to the abundance of game and the fortune of hunting. Summer
arrived, and dogs and men packed on their backs, rafted across blue
mountain lakes, and descended or ascended unknown rivers in slender
boats whipsawed from the standing forest.

<p/>The months came and went, and back and forth they twisted through the
uncharted vastness, where no men were and yet where men had been if
the Lost Cabin were true. They went across divides in summer blizzards,
shivered under the midnight sun on naked mountains between the timber
line and the eternal snows, dropped into summer valleys amid swarming
gnats and flies, and in the shadows of glaciers picked strawberries and
flowers as ripe and fair as any the Southland could boast. In the fall
of the year they penetrated a weird lake country, sad and silent,
where wildfowl had been, but where then there was no life nor sign of
life--only the blowing of chill winds, the forming of ice in sheltered
places, and the melancholy rippling of waves on lonely beaches.

<p/>And through another winter they wandered on the obliterated trails of
men who had gone before. Once, they came upon a path blazed through the
forest, an ancient path, and the Lost Cabin seemed very near. But the
path began nowhere and ended nowhere, and it remained mystery, as the
man who made it and the reason he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) made it remained mystery. Another time
they chanced upon the time-graven wreckage of a hunting lodge, and
amid the shreds of rotted blankets John Thornton found a long-barrelled
flint-lock. He (<font color='blue'><b>Thornton</b></font>) knew it for a Hudson Bay Company gun of the young days
in the Northwest, when such a gun was worth its height in beaver skins
packed flat, And that was all--no hint as to the man who in an early day
had reared the lodge and left the gun among the blankets.

<p/>Spring came on once more, and at the end of all their wandering they
found, not the Lost Cabin, but a shallow placer in a broad valley where
the gold showed like yellow butter across the bottom of the washing-pan.
They sought no farther. Each day they worked earned them thousands of
dollars in clean dust and nuggets, and they worked every day. The gold
was sacked in moose-hide bags, fifty pounds to the bag, and piled
like so much firewood outside the spruce-bough lodge. Like giants they
toiled, days flashing on the heels of days like dreams as they heaped
the treasure up.

<p/>There was nothing for the dogs to do, save the hauling in of meat now
and again that Thornton killed, and Buck spent long hours musing by
the fire. The vision of the short-legged hairy man came to him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) more
frequently, now that there was little work to be done; and often,
blinking by the fire, Buck wandered with him (<font color='blue'><b>Buck</b></font>) in that other world which
he (<font color='blue'><b>Buck</b></font>) remembered.

<p/>The salient thing of this other world seemed fear. When he (<font color='blue'><b>Buck</b></font>) watched the
hairy man sleeping by the fire, head between his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) knees and hands
clasped above, Buck saw that he (<font color='blue'><b>Buck</b></font>) slept restlessly, with many starts and
awakenings, at which times he (<font color='blue'><b>Buck</b></font>) would peer fearfully into the darkness
and fling more wood upon the fire. Did they walk by the beach of a sea,
where the hairy man gathered shellfish and ate them as he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) gathered,
it was with eyes that roved everywhere for hidden danger and with legs
prepared to run like the wind at its first appearance. Through the
forest they crept noiselessly, Buck at the hairy man's heels; and they
were alert and vigilant, the pair of them, ears twitching and moving and
nostrils quivering, for the man heard and smelled as keenly as Buck. The
hairy man could spring up into the trees and travel ahead as fast as on
the ground, swinging by the arms from limb to limb, sometimes a dozen
feet apart, letting go and catching, never falling, never missing his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>)
grip. In fact, he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) seemed as much at home among the trees as on the
ground; and Buck had memories of nights of vigil spent beneath trees
wherein the hairy man roosted, holding on tightly as he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) slept.

<p/>And closely akin to the visions of the hairy man was the call still
sounding in the depths of the forest. It filled him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) with a great unrest
and strange desires. It caused him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) to feel a vague, sweet gladness,
and he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) was aware of wild yearnings and stirrings for he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) knew not what.
Sometimes he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) pursued the call into the forest, looking for it as though
it were a tangible thing, barking softly or defiantly, as the mood might
dictate. He (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) would thrust his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) nose into the cool wood moss, or into the
black soil where long grasses grew, and snort with joy at the fat earth
smells; or he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) would crouch for hours, as if in concealment, behind
fungus-covered trunks of fallen trees, wide-eyed and wide-eared to all
that moved and sounded about him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>). It might be, lying thus, that he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) hoped
to surprise this call he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) could not understand. But he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) did not know why
he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) did these various things. He (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) was impelled to do them, and did not
reason about them at all.

<p/>Irresistible impulses seized him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>). He (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) would be lying in camp, dozing
lazily in the heat of the day, when suddenly his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) head would lift and his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>)
ears cock up, intent and listening, and he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) would spring to his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) feet
and dash away, and on and on, for hours, through the forest aisles and
across the open spaces where the niggerheads bunched. He (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) loved to run
down dry watercourses, and to creep and spy upon the bird life in the
woods. For a day at a time he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) would lie in the underbrush where he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) could
watch the partridges drumming and strutting up and down. But especially
he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) loved to run in the dim twilight of the summer midnights, listening
to the subdued and sleepy murmurs of the forest, reading signs and
sounds as man may read a book, and seeking for the mysterious something
that called--called, waking or sleeping, at all times, for him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) to come.

<p/>One night he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) sprang from sleep with a start, eager-eyed, nostrils
quivering and scenting, his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) mane bristling in recurrent waves. From the
forest came the call -LRB-or one note of it, for the call was many noted-RRB-,
distinct and definite as never before,--a long-drawn howl, like, yet
unlike, any noise made by husky dog. And he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) knew it, in the old familiar
way, as a sound heard before. He (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) sprang through the sleeping camp and in
swift silence dashed through the woods. As he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) drew closer to the cry
he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) went more slowly, with caution in every movement, till he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) came to an
open place among the trees, and looking out saw, erect on haunches, with
nose pointed to the sky, a long, lean, timber wolf.

<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>wolf</b></font>) had made no noise, yet it ceased from its howling and tried to sense
his (<font color='blue'><b>wolf</b></font>) presence. Buck stalked into the open, half crouching, body gathered
compactly together, tail straight and stiff, feet falling with unwonted
care. Every movement advertised commingled threatening and overture of
friendliness. It was the menacing truce that marks the meeting of wild
beasts that prey. But the wolf fled at sight of him (<font color='blue'><b>wolf</b></font>). He (<font color='blue'><b>wolf</b></font>) followed, with
wild leapings, in a frenzy to overtake. He (<font color='blue'><b>wolf</b></font>) ran him (<font color='blue'><b>wolf</b></font>) into a blind channel,
in the bed of the creek where a timber jam barred the way. The wolf
whirled about, pivoting on his (<font color='blue'><b>wolf</b></font>) hind legs after the fashion of Joe and
of all cornered husky dogs, snarling and bristling, clipping his (<font color='blue'><b>wolf</b></font>) teeth
together in a continuous and rapid succession of snaps.

<p/>Buck did not attack, but circled him (<font color='blue'><b>Buck</b></font>) about and hedged him (<font color='blue'><b>Buck</b></font>) in with
friendly advances. The wolf was suspicious and afraid; for Buck made
three of him (<font color='blue'><b>Buck</b></font>) in weight, while his (<font color='blue'><b>Buck</b></font>) head barely reached Buck's shoulder.
Watching his (<font color='blue'><b>Buck</b></font>) chance, he (<font color='blue'><b>Buck</b></font>) darted away, and the chase was resumed. Time
and again he (<font color='blue'><b>Buck</b></font>) was cornered, and the thing repeated, though he (<font color='blue'><b>Buck</b></font>) was in poor
condition, or Buck could not so easily have overtaken him (<font color='blue'><b>Buck</b></font>). He (<font color='blue'><b>Buck</b></font>) would run
till Buck's head was even with his (<font color='blue'><b>Buck</b></font>) flank, when he (<font color='blue'><b>Buck</b></font>) would whirl around at
bay, only to dash away again at the first opportunity.

<p/>But in the end Buck's pertinacity was rewarded; for the wolf, finding
that no harm was intended, finally sniffed noses with him (<font color='blue'><b>Buck</b></font>). Then they
became friendly, and played about in the nervous, half-coy way with
which fierce beasts belie their fierceness. After some time of this the
wolf started off at an easy lope in a manner that plainly showed he (<font color='blue'><b>wolf</b></font>) was
going somewhere. He (<font color='blue'><b>wolf</b></font>) made it clear to Buck that he (<font color='blue'><b>Buck</b></font>) was to come, and they
ran side by side through the sombre twilight, straight up the creek bed,
into the gorge from which it issued, and across the bleak divide where
it took its rise.

<p/>On the opposite slope of the watershed they came down into a level
country where were great stretches of forest and many streams, and
through these great stretches they ran steadily, hour after hour, the
sun rising higher and the day growing warmer. Buck was wildly glad. He (<font color='blue'><b>Buck</b></font>)
knew he (<font color='blue'><b>Buck</b></font>) was at last answering the call, running by the side of his (<font color='blue'><b>Buck</b></font>) wood
brother toward the place from where the call surely came. Old memories
were coming upon him (<font color='blue'><b>Buck</b></font>) fast, and he (<font color='blue'><b>Buck</b></font>) was stirring to them as of old he (<font color='blue'><b>Buck</b></font>)
stirred to the realities of which they were the shadows. He (<font color='blue'><b>Buck</b></font>) had done
this thing before, somewhere in that other and dimly remembered world,
and he (<font color='blue'><b>Buck</b></font>) was doing it again, now, running free in the open, the unpacked
earth underfoot, the wide sky overhead.

<p/>They stopped by a running stream to drink, and, stopping, Buck
remembered John Thornton. He (<font color='blue'><b>Buck</b></font>) sat down. The wolf started on toward the
place from where the call surely came, then returned to him (<font color='blue'><b>Buck</b></font>), sniffing
noses and making actions as though to encourage him (<font color='blue'><b>Buck</b></font>). But Buck turned
about and started slowly on the back track. For the better part of an
hour the wild brother ran by his (<font color='blue'><b>brother</b></font>) side, whining softly. Then he (<font color='blue'><b>brother</b></font>) sat down,
pointed his (<font color='blue'><b>brother</b></font>) nose upward, and howled. It was a mournful howl, and as Buck
held steadily on his (<font color='blue'><b>Buck</b></font>) way he (<font color='blue'><b>Buck</b></font>) heard it grow faint and fainter until it was
lost in the distance.

<p/>John Thornton was eating dinner when Buck dashed into camp and sprang
upon him (<font color='blue'><b>Buck</b></font>) in a frenzy of affection, overturning him (<font color='blue'><b>Buck</b></font>), scrambling upon him (<font color='blue'><b>Buck</b></font>),
licking his (<font color='blue'><b>Buck</b></font>) face, biting his (<font color='blue'><b>Buck</b></font>) hand--<div class="bookquote">``playing the general tom-fool,''  (<font color='red'><b>him</b></font>)</div>as
John Thornton characterized it, the while he (<font color='blue'><b>Thornton</b></font>) shook Buck back and forth
and cursed him (<font color='blue'><b>Buck</b></font>) lovingly.

<p/>For two days and nights Buck never left camp, never let Thornton out of
his (<font color='blue'><b>Buck</b></font>) sight. He (<font color='blue'><b>Buck</b></font>) followed him (<font color='blue'><b>Buck</b></font>) about at his (<font color='blue'><b>Buck</b></font>) work, watched him (<font color='blue'><b>Buck</b></font>) while he (<font color='blue'><b>Buck</b></font>) ate,
saw him (<font color='blue'><b>Buck</b></font>) into his (<font color='blue'><b>Buck</b></font>) blankets at night and out of them in the morning. But
after two days the call in the forest began to sound more imperiously
than ever. Buck's restlessness came back on him (<font color='blue'><b>Buck</b></font>), and he (<font color='blue'><b>Buck</b></font>) was haunted by
recollections of the wild brother, and of the smiling land beyond the
divide and the run side by side through the wide forest stretches. Once
again he (<font color='blue'><b>Buck</b></font>) took to wandering in the woods, but the wild brother came no
more; and though he (<font color='blue'><b>brother</b></font>) listened through long vigils, the mournful howl was
never raised.

<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>brother</b></font>) began to sleep out at night, staying away from camp for days at a
time; and once he (<font color='blue'><b>brother</b></font>) crossed the divide at the head of the creek and went
down into the land of timber and streams. There he (<font color='blue'><b>brother</b></font>) wandered for a week,
seeking vainly for fresh sign of the wild brother, killing his (<font color='blue'><b>brother</b></font>) meat as
he (<font color='blue'><b>brother</b></font>) travelled and travelling with the long, easy lope that seems never to
tire. He (<font color='blue'><b>brother</b></font>) fished for salmon in a broad stream that emptied somewhere into
the sea, and by this stream he (<font color='blue'><b>brother</b></font>) killed a large black bear, blinded by
the mosquitoes while likewise fishing, and raging through the forest
helpless and terrible. Even so, it was a hard fight, and it aroused the
last latent remnants of Buck's ferocity. And two days later, when he (<font color='blue'><b>Buck</b></font>)
returned to his (<font color='blue'><b>Buck</b></font>) kill and found a dozen wolverenes quarrelling over the
spoil, he (<font color='blue'><b>Buck</b></font>) scattered them like chaff; and those that fled left two behind
who would quarrel no more.

<p/>The blood-longing became stronger than ever before. He (<font color='blue'><b>Buck</b></font>) was a killer, a
thing that preyed, living on the things that lived, unaided, alone,
by virtue of his (<font color='blue'><b>Buck</b></font>) own strength and prowess, surviving triumphantly in a
hostile environment where only the strong survived. Because of all this
he (<font color='blue'><b>Buck</b></font>) became possessed of a great pride in himself, which communicated
itself like a contagion to his (<font color='blue'><b>Buck</b></font>) physical being. It advertised itself
in all his (<font color='blue'><b>Buck</b></font>) movements, was apparent in the play of every muscle, spoke
plainly as speech in the way he (<font color='blue'><b>Buck</b></font>) carried himself, and made his (<font color='blue'><b>Buck</b></font>) glorious
furry coat if anything more glorious. But for the stray brown on his (<font color='blue'><b>Buck</b></font>)
muzzle and above his (<font color='blue'><b>Buck</b></font>) eyes, and for the splash of white hair that ran
midmost down his (<font color='blue'><b>Buck</b></font>) chest, he (<font color='blue'><b>Buck</b></font>) might well have been mistaken for a gigantic
wolf, larger than the largest of the breed. From his (<font color='blue'><b>Buck</b></font>) St. Bernard father
he (<font color='blue'><b>Buck</b></font>) had inherited size and weight, but it was his (<font color='blue'><b>Buck</b></font>) shepherd mother who
had given shape to that size and weight. His (<font color='blue'><b>Buck</b></font>) muzzle was the long wolf
muzzle, save that it was larger than the muzzle of any wolf; and his (<font color='blue'><b>wolf</b></font>) head,
somewhat broader, was the wolf head on a massive scale.

<p/>His (<font color='blue'><b>wolf</b></font>) cunning was wolf cunning, and wild cunning; his (<font color='blue'><b>wolf</b></font>) intelligence,
shepherd intelligence and St. Bernard intelligence; and all this, plus
an experience gained in the fiercest of schools, made him (<font color='blue'><b>Bernard</b></font>) as formidable
a creature as any that roamed the wild. A carnivorous
animal living on a straight meat diet, he (<font color='blue'><b>Bernard</b></font>) was in full flower, at the
high tide of his (<font color='blue'><b>Bernard</b></font>) life, overspilling with vigor and virility. When
Thornton passed a caressing hand along his (<font color='blue'><b>Thornton</b></font>) back, a snapping and
crackling followed the hand, each hair discharging its pent magnetism
at the contact. Every part, brain and body, nerve tissue and fibre, was
keyed to the most exquisite pitch; and between all the parts there was a
perfect equilibrium or adjustment. To sights and sounds and events which
required action, he (<font color='blue'><b>Thornton</b></font>) responded with lightning-like rapidity. Quickly as
a husky dog could leap to defend from attack or to attack, he (<font color='blue'><b>Thornton</b></font>) could leap
twice as quickly. He (<font color='blue'><b>Thornton</b></font>) saw the movement, or heard sound, and responded
in less time than another dog required to compass the mere seeing or
hearing. He (<font color='blue'><b>Thornton</b></font>) perceived and determined and responded in the same instant.
In point of fact the three actions of perceiving, determining, and
responding were sequential; but so infinitesimal were the intervals
of time between them that they appeared simultaneous. His (<font color='blue'><b>Thornton</b></font>) muscles were
surcharged with vitality, and snapped into play sharply, like steel
springs. Life streamed through him (<font color='blue'><b>Thornton</b></font>) in splendid flood, glad and rampant,
until it seemed that it would burst him (<font color='blue'><b>Thornton</b></font>) asunder in sheer ecstasy and
pour forth generously over the world.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Never was there such a dog,''  (<font color='red'><b>Thornton/John Thornton/John</b></font>)</div>said John Thornton one day, as the
partners watched Buck marching out of camp.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``When he (<font color='blue'><b>Buck</b></font>) was made, the mould was broke,''  (<font color='red'><b>Pete</b></font>)</div>said Pete.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Py jingo! I t`ink so mineself,''  (<font color='red'><b>Hans</b></font>)</div>Hans affirmed.

<p/>They saw him (<font color='blue'><b>Hans</b></font>) marching out of camp, but they did not see the instant and
terrible transformation which took place as soon as he (<font color='blue'><b>Hans</b></font>) was within the
secrecy of the forest. He (<font color='blue'><b>Hans</b></font>) no longer marched. At once he (<font color='blue'><b>Hans</b></font>) became a thing
of the wild, stealing along softly, cat-footed, a passing shadow
that appeared and disappeared among the shadows. He (<font color='blue'><b>Hans</b></font>) knew how to take
advantage of every cover, to crawl on his (<font color='blue'><b>Hans</b></font>) belly like a snake, and like a
snake to leap and strike. He (<font color='blue'><b>Hans</b></font>) could take a ptarmigan from its nest, kill
a rabbit as it slept, and snap in mid air the little chipmunks fleeing
a second too late for the trees. Fish, in open pools, were not too quick
for him (<font color='blue'><b>Hans</b></font>); nor were beaver, mending their dams, too wary. He (<font color='blue'><b>Hans</b></font>) killed
to eat, not from wantonness; but he (<font color='blue'><b>Hans</b></font>) preferred to eat what he (<font color='blue'><b>Hans</b></font>) killed
himself. So a lurking humor ran through his (<font color='blue'><b>Hans</b></font>) deeds, and it was his (<font color='blue'><b>Hans</b></font>)
delight to steal upon the squirrels, and, when he (<font color='blue'><b>Hans</b></font>) all but had them, to
let them go, chattering in mortal fear to the treetops.

<p/>As the fall of the year came on, the moose appeared in greater
abundance, moving slowly down to meet the winter in the lower and less
rigorous valleys. Buck had already dragged down a stray part-grown calf;
but he (<font color='blue'><b>Buck</b></font>) wished strongly for larger and more formidable quarry, and he (<font color='blue'><b>Buck</b></font>)
came upon it one day on the divide at the head of the creek. A band of
twenty moose had crossed over from the land of streams and timber,
and chief among them was a great bull. He (<font color='blue'><b>chief</b></font>) was in a savage temper, and,
standing over six feet from the ground, was as formidable an antagonist
as even Buck could desire. Back and forth the bull tossed his (<font color='blue'><b>Buck</b></font>) great
palmated antlers, branching to fourteen points and embracing seven feet
within the tips. His (<font color='blue'><b>Buck</b></font>) small eyes burned with a vicious and bitter light,
while he (<font color='blue'><b>Buck</b></font>) roared with fury at sight of Buck.

<p/>From the bull's side, just forward of the flank, protruded a feathered
arrow-end, which accounted for his (<font color='blue'><b>Buck</b></font>) savageness. Guided by that instinct
which came from the old hunting days of the primordial world, Buck
proceeded to cut the bull out from the herd. It was no slight task. He (<font color='blue'><b>Buck</b></font>)
would bark and dance about in front of the bull, just out of reach
of the great antlers and of the terrible splay hoofs which could have
stamped his (<font color='blue'><b>Buck</b></font>) life out with a single blow. Unable to turn his (<font color='blue'><b>Buck</b></font>) back on
the fanged danger and go on, the bull would be driven into paroxysms of
rage. At such moments he (<font color='blue'><b>Buck</b></font>) charged Buck, who retreated craftily, luring
him (<font color='blue'><b>Buck</b></font>) on by a simulated inability to escape. But when he (<font color='blue'><b>Buck</b></font>) was thus
separated from his (<font color='blue'><b>Buck</b></font>) fellows, two or three of the younger bulls would
charge back upon Buck and enable the wounded bull to rejoin the herd.

<p/>There is a patience of the wild--dogged, tireless, persistent as life
itself--that holds motionless for endless hours the spider in its web,
the snake in its coils, the panther in its ambuscade; this patience
belongs peculiarly to life when it hunts its living food; and it
belonged to Buck as he (<font color='blue'><b>Buck</b></font>) clung to the flank of the herd, retarding
its march, irritating the young bulls, worrying the cows with their
half-grown calves, and driving the wounded bull mad with helpless rage.
For half a day this continued. Buck multiplied himself, attacking from
all sides, enveloping the herd in a whirlwind of menace, cutting out his (<font color='blue'><b>Buck</b></font>)
victim as fast as it could rejoin its mates, wearing out the patience of
creatures preyed upon, which is a lesser patience than that of creatures
preying.

<p/>As the day wore along and the sun dropped to its bed in the northwest
-LRB-the darkness had come back and the fall nights were six hours long-RRB-,
the young bulls retraced their steps more and more reluctantly to the
aid of their beset leader. The down-coming winter was harrying them
on to the lower levels, and it seemed they could never shake off this
tireless creature that held them back. Besides, it was not the life of
the herd, or of the young bulls, that was threatened. The life of only
one member was demanded, which was a remoter interest than their lives,
and in the end they were content to pay the toll.

<p/>As twilight fell the old bull stood with lowered head, watching his (<font color='blue'><b>member</b></font>)
mates--the cows he (<font color='blue'><b>member</b></font>) had known, the calves he (<font color='blue'><b>member</b></font>) had fathered, the bulls he (<font color='blue'><b>member</b></font>)
had mastered--as they shambled on at a rapid pace through the fading
light. He (<font color='blue'><b>member</b></font>) could not follow, for before his (<font color='blue'><b>member</b></font>) nose leaped the merciless
fanged terror that would not let him (<font color='blue'><b>member</b></font>) go. Three hundredweight more than
half a ton he (<font color='blue'><b>member</b></font>) weighed; he (<font color='blue'><b>member</b></font>) had lived a long, strong life, full of fight
and struggle, and at the end he (<font color='blue'><b>member</b></font>) faced death at the teeth of a creature
whose head did not reach beyond his (<font color='blue'><b>member</b></font>) great knuckled knees.

<p/>From then on, night and day, Buck never left his (<font color='blue'><b>Buck</b></font>) prey, never gave it a
moment's rest, never permitted it to browse the leaves of trees or
the shoots of young birch and willow. Nor did he (<font color='blue'><b>Buck</b></font>) give the wounded bull
opportunity to slake his (<font color='blue'><b>Buck</b></font>) burning thirst in the slender trickling streams
they crossed. Often, in desperation, he (<font color='blue'><b>Buck</b></font>) burst into long stretches of
flight. At such times Buck did not attempt to stay him (<font color='blue'><b>Buck</b></font>), but loped easily
at his (<font color='blue'><b>Buck</b></font>) heels, satisfied with the way the game was played, lying down
when the moose stood still, attacking him (<font color='blue'><b>Buck</b></font>) fiercely when he (<font color='blue'><b>Buck</b></font>) strove to eat
or drink.

<p/>The great head drooped more and more under its tree of horns, and
the shambling trot grew weak and weaker. He (<font color='blue'><b>Buck</b></font>) took to standing for long
periods, with nose to the ground and dejected ears dropped limply; and
Buck found more time in which to get water for himself and in which to
rest. At such moments, panting with red lolling tongue and with eyes
fixed upon the big bull, it appeared to Buck that a change was coming
over the face of things. He (<font color='blue'><b>Buck</b></font>) could feel a new stir in the land. As the
moose were coming into the land, other kinds of life were coming in.
Forest and stream and air seemed palpitant with their presence. The news
of it was borne in upon him (<font color='blue'><b>Buck</b></font>), not by sight, or sound, or smell, but by
some other and subtler sense. He (<font color='blue'><b>Buck</b></font>) heard nothing, saw nothing, yet knew
that the land was somehow different; that through it strange things were
afoot and ranging; and he (<font color='blue'><b>Buck</b></font>) resolved to investigate after he (<font color='blue'><b>Buck</b></font>) had finished
the business in hand.

<p/>At last, at the end of the fourth day, he (<font color='blue'><b>Buck</b></font>) pulled the great moose down.
For a day and a night he (<font color='blue'><b>Buck</b></font>) remained by the kill, eating and sleeping, turn
and turn about. Then, rested, refreshed and strong, he (<font color='blue'><b>Buck</b></font>) turned his (<font color='blue'><b>Buck</b></font>) face
toward camp and John Thornton. He (<font color='blue'><b>Buck</b></font>) broke into the long easy lope, and
went on, hour after hour, never at loss for the tangled way, heading
straight home through strange country with a certitude of direction that
put man and his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) magnetic needle to shame.

<p/>As he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) held on he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) became more and more conscious of the new stir in the
land. There was life abroad in it different from the life which had been
there throughout the summer. No longer was this fact borne in upon him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>)
in some subtle, mysterious way. The birds talked of it, the squirrels
chattered about it, the very breeze whispered of it. Several times he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>)
stopped and drew in the fresh morning air in great sniffs, reading a
message which made him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) leap on with greater speed. He (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) was oppressed with
a sense of calamity happening, if it were not calamity already happened;
and as he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) crossed the last watershed and dropped down into the valley
toward camp, he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) proceeded with greater caution.

<p/>Three miles away he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) came upon a fresh trail that sent his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) neck hair
rippling and bristling, It led straight toward camp and John Thornton.
Buck hurried on, swiftly and stealthily, every nerve straining and
tense, alert to the multitudinous details which told a story--all but
the end. His (<font color='blue'><b>Buck</b></font>) nose gave him (<font color='blue'><b>Buck</b></font>) a varying description of the passage of the
life on the heels of which he (<font color='blue'><b>Buck</b></font>) was travelling. He (<font color='blue'><b>Buck</b></font>) remarked the pregnant
silence of the forest. The bird life had flitted. The squirrels were in
hiding. One only he (<font color='blue'><b>Buck</b></font>) saw,--a sleek gray fellow, flattened against a gray
dead limb so that he (<font color='blue'><b>Buck</b></font>) seemed a part of it, a woody excrescence upon the
wood itself.

<p/>As Buck slid along with the obscureness of a gliding shadow, his (<font color='blue'><b>Buck</b></font>) nose
was jerked suddenly to the side as though a positive force had gripped
and pulled it. He (<font color='blue'><b>Buck</b></font>) followed the new scent into a thicket and found Nig.
He (<font color='blue'><b>Buck</b></font>) was lying on his (<font color='blue'><b>Buck</b></font>) side, dead where he (<font color='blue'><b>Buck</b></font>) had dragged himself, an arrow
protruding, head and feathers, from either side of his (<font color='blue'><b>Buck</b></font>) body.

<p/>A hundred yards farther on, Buck came upon one of the sled-dogs Thornton
had bought in Dawson. This dog was thrashing about in a death-struggle,
directly on the trail, and Buck passed around him (<font color='blue'><b>Buck</b></font>) without stopping. From
the camp came the faint sound of many voices, rising and falling in a
sing-song chant. Bellying forward to the edge of the clearing, he (<font color='blue'><b>Buck</b></font>) found
Hans, lying on his (<font color='blue'><b>Hans</b></font>) face, feathered with arrows like a porcupine. At the
same instant Buck peered out where the spruce-bough lodge had been and
saw what made his (<font color='blue'><b>Buck</b></font>) hair leap straight up on his (<font color='blue'><b>Buck</b></font>) neck and shoulders.
A gust of overpowering rage swept over him (<font color='blue'><b>Buck</b></font>). He (<font color='blue'><b>Buck</b></font>) did not know that he (<font color='blue'><b>Buck</b></font>)
growled, but he (<font color='blue'><b>Buck</b></font>) growled aloud with a terrible ferocity. For the last
time in his (<font color='blue'><b>Buck</b></font>) life he (<font color='blue'><b>Buck</b></font>) allowed passion to usurp cunning and reason, and it
was because of his (<font color='blue'><b>Buck</b></font>) great love for John Thornton that he (<font color='blue'><b>Thornton</b></font>) lost his (<font color='blue'><b>Thornton</b></font>) head.

<p/>The Yeehats were dancing about the wreckage of the spruce-bough lodge
when they heard a fearful roaring and saw rushing upon them an animal
the like of which they had never seen before. It was Buck, a live
hurricane of fury, hurling himself upon them in a frenzy to destroy. He (<font color='blue'><b>Buck</b></font>)
sprang at the foremost man -LRB-it was the chief of the Yeehats-RRB-, ripping
the throat wide open till the rent jugular spouted a fountain of blood.
He (<font color='blue'><b>Buck</b></font>) did not pause to worry the victim, but ripped in passing, with
the next bound tearing wide the throat of a second man. There was
no withstanding him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>). He (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) plunged about in their very midst, tearing,
rending, destroying, in constant and terrific motion which defied the
arrows they discharged at him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>). In fact, so inconceivably rapid were his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>)
movements, and so closely were the Indians tangled together, that they
shot one another with the arrows; and one young hunter, hurling a spear
at Buck in mid air, drove it through the chest of another hunter with
such force that the point broke through the skin of the back and stood
out beyond. Then a panic seized the Yeehats, and they fled in terror to
the woods, proclaiming as they fled the advent of the Evil Spirit.

<p/>And truly Buck was the Fiend incarnate, raging at their heels and
dragging them down like deer as they raced through the trees. It was
a fateful day for the Yeehats. They scattered far and wide over the
country, and it was not till a week later that the last of the survivors
gathered together in a lower valley and counted their losses. As for
Buck, wearying of the pursuit, he (<font color='blue'><b>Buck</b></font>) returned to the desolated camp. He (<font color='blue'><b>Buck</b></font>)
found Pete where he (<font color='blue'><b>Buck</b></font>) had been killed in his (<font color='blue'><b>Buck</b></font>) blankets in the first moment
of surprise. Thornton's desperate struggle was fresh-written on the
earth, and Buck scented every detail of it down to the edge of a deep
pool. By the edge, head and fore feet in the water, lay Skeet, faithful
to the last. The pool itself, muddy and discolored from the sluice
boxes, effectually hid what it contained, and it contained John
Thornton; for Buck followed his (<font color='blue'><b>Buck</b></font>) trace into the water, from which no
trace led away.

<p/>All day Buck brooded by the pool or roamed restlessly about the camp.
Death, as a cessation of movement, as a passing out and away from the
lives of the living, he (<font color='blue'><b>Buck</b></font>) knew, and he (<font color='blue'><b>Buck</b></font>) knew John Thornton was dead. It
left a great void in him (<font color='blue'><b>Thornton</b></font>), somewhat akin to hunger, but a void which
ached and ached, and which food could not fill, At times, when he (<font color='blue'><b>Thornton</b></font>) paused
to contemplate the carcasses of the Yeehats, he (<font color='blue'><b>Thornton</b></font>) forgot the pain of it;
and at such times he (<font color='blue'><b>Thornton</b></font>) was aware of a great pride in himself,--a pride
greater than any he (<font color='blue'><b>Thornton</b></font>) had yet experienced. He (<font color='blue'><b>Thornton</b></font>) had killed man, the noblest
game of all, and he (<font color='blue'><b>Thornton</b></font>) had killed in the face of the law of club and fang.
He (<font color='blue'><b>Thornton</b></font>) sniffed the bodies curiously. They had died so easily. It was harder
to kill a husky dog than them. They were no match at all, were it
not for their arrows and spears and clubs. Thenceforward he (<font color='blue'><b>Thornton</b></font>) would be
unafraid of them except when they bore in their hands their arrows,
spears, and clubs.

<p/>Night came on, and a full moon rose high over the trees into the sky,
lighting the land till it lay bathed in ghostly day. And with the coming
of the night, brooding and mourning by the pool, Buck became alive to a
stirring of the new life in the forest other than that which the Yeehats
had made, He (<font color='blue'><b>Buck</b></font>) stood up, listening and scenting. From far away drifted a
faint, sharp yelp, followed by a chorus of similar sharp yelps. As the
moments passed the yelps grew closer and louder. Again Buck knew them
as things heard in that other world which persisted in his (<font color='blue'><b>Buck</b></font>) memory. He (<font color='blue'><b>Buck</b></font>)
walked to the centre of the open space and listened. It was the call,
the many-noted call, sounding more luringly and compellingly than ever
before. And as never before, he (<font color='blue'><b>Buck</b></font>) was ready to obey. John Thornton was
dead. The last tie was broken. Man and the claims of man no longer bound
him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>).

<p/>Hunting their living meat, as the Yeehats were hunting it, on the flanks
of the migrating moose, the wolf pack had at last crossed over from the
land of streams and timber and invaded Buck's valley. Into the clearing
where the moonlight streamed, they poured in a silvery flood; and in the
centre of the clearing stood Buck, motionless as a statue, waiting their
coming. They were awed, so still and large he (<font color='blue'><b>Buck</b></font>) stood, and a moment's
pause fell, till the boldest one leaped straight for him (<font color='blue'><b>Buck</b></font>). Like a flash
Buck struck, breaking the neck. Then he (<font color='blue'><b>Buck</b></font>) stood, without movement, as
before, the stricken wolf rolling in agony behind him (<font color='blue'><b>Buck</b></font>). Three others
tried it in sharp succession; and one after the other they drew back,
streaming blood from slashed throats or shoulders.

<p/>This was sufficient to fling the whole pack forward, pell-mell, crowded
together, blocked and confused by its eagerness to pull down the
prey. Buck's marvellous quickness and agility stood him (<font color='blue'><b>Buck</b></font>) in good stead.
Pivoting on his (<font color='blue'><b>Buck</b></font>) hind legs, and snapping and gashing, he (<font color='blue'><b>Buck</b></font>) was everywhere
at once, presenting a front which was apparently unbroken so swiftly did
he (<font color='blue'><b>Buck</b></font>) whirl and guard from side to side. But to prevent them from getting
behind him (<font color='blue'><b>Buck</b></font>), he (<font color='blue'><b>Buck</b></font>) was forced back, down past the pool and into the creek
bed, till he (<font color='blue'><b>Buck</b></font>) brought up against a high gravel bank. He (<font color='blue'><b>Buck</b></font>) worked along to a
right angle in the bank which the men had made in the course of mining,
and in this angle he (<font color='blue'><b>Buck</b></font>) came to bay, protected on three sides and with
nothing to do but face the front.

<p/>And so well did he (<font color='blue'><b>Buck</b></font>) face it, that at the end of half an hour the wolves
drew back discomfited. The tongues of all were out and lolling, the
white fangs showing cruelly white in the moonlight. Some were lying down
with heads raised and ears pricked forward; others stood on their feet,
watching him (<font color='blue'><b>Buck</b></font>); and still others were lapping water from the pool. One
wolf, long and lean and gray, advanced cautiously, in a friendly manner,
and Buck recognized the wild brother with whom he (<font color='blue'><b>Buck</b></font>) had run for a night
and a day. He (<font color='blue'><b>Buck</b></font>) was whining softly, and, as Buck whined, they touched
noses.

<p/>Then an old wolf, gaunt and battle-scarred, came forward. Buck writhed
his (<font color='blue'><b>Buck</b></font>) lips into the preliminary of a snarl, but sniffed noses with him (<font color='blue'><b>Buck</b></font>),
Whereupon the old wolf sat down, pointed nose at the moon, and broke
out the long wolf howl. The others sat down and howled. And now the call
came to Buck in unmistakable accents. He (<font color='blue'><b>Buck</b></font>), too, sat down and howled. This
over, he (<font color='blue'><b>Buck</b></font>) came out of his (<font color='blue'><b>Buck</b></font>) angle and the pack crowded around him (<font color='blue'><b>Buck</b></font>), sniffing
in half-friendly, half-savage manner. The leaders lifted the yelp of the
pack and sprang away into the woods. The wolves swung in behind, yelping
in chorus. And Buck ran with them, side by side with the wild brother,
yelping as he (<font color='blue'><b>Buck</b></font>) ran.

<p/>* * * * *

<p/>And here may well end the story of Buck. The years were not many when
the Yeehats noted a change in the breed of timber wolves; for some were
seen with splashes of brown on head and muzzle, and with a rift of white
centring down the chest. But more remarkable than this, the Yeehats tell
of a Ghost Dog that runs at the head of the pack. They are afraid of
this Ghost Dog, for it has cunning greater than they, stealing from
their camps in fierce winters, robbing their traps, slaying their dogs,
and defying their bravest hunters.

<p/>Nay, the tale grows worse. Hunters there are who fail to return to
the camp, and hunters there have been whom their tribesmen found with
throats slashed cruelly open and with wolf prints about them in the snow
greater than the prints of any wolf. Each fall, when the Yeehats follow
the movement of the moose, there is a certain valley which they never
enter. And women there are who become sad when the word goes over
the fire of how the Evil Spirit came to select that valley for an
abiding-place.

<p/>In the summers there is one visitor, however, to that valley, of which
the Yeehats do not know. It is a great, gloriously coated wolf, like,
and yet unlike, all other wolves. He (<font color='blue'><b>wolf</b></font>) crosses alone from the smiling
timber land and comes down into an open space among the trees. Here
a yellow stream flows from rotted moose-hide sacks and sinks into
the ground, with long grasses growing through it and vegetable mould
overrunning it and hiding its yellow from the sun; and here he (<font color='blue'><b>wolf</b></font>) muses for
a time, howling once, long and mournfully, ere he (<font color='blue'><b>wolf</b></font>) departs.

<p/>But he (<font color='blue'><b>wolf</b></font>) is not always alone. When the long winter nights come on and the
wolves follow their meat into the lower valleys, he (<font color='blue'><b>wolf</b></font>) may be seen running
at the head of the pack through the pale moonlight or glimmering
borealis, leaping gigantic above his (<font color='blue'><b>wolf</b></font>) fellows, his (<font color='blue'><b>wolf</b></font>) great throat a-bellow
as he (<font color='blue'><b>wolf</b></font>) sings a song of the younger world, which is the song of the pack.
