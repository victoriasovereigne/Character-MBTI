Well , then , at the end of a month , when drinking water from the same carafe , you would kill the person who drank with you , without your perceiving , otherwise than from slight inconvenience , that there was any poisonous substance mingled with this water .

Science becomes , in their hands , not only a defensive weapon , but still more frequently an offensive one ; the one serves against all their physical sufferings , the other against all their enemies . With opium , belladonna , brucea , snake - wood , and the cherry-laurel , they put to sleep all who stand in their way . There is not one of those women , Egyptian , Turkish , or Greek , whom here you call ` good women , ' who do not know how , by means of chemistry , to stupefy a doctor , and in psychology to amaze a confessor .

There are as many elixirs of every kind as there are caprices and peculiarities in the physical and moral nature of humanity ; and I will say further -- the art of these chemists is capable with the utmost precision to accommodate and proportion the remedy and the bane to yearnings for love or desires for vengeance . '' ","i":278601},{"w":"`` Precisely so , '' ","i":280629},{"w":"`` precisely so ; and this is what I said to my worthy Adelmonte . He reflected , smiled , and replied to me by a Sicilian proverb , which I believe is also a French proverb , ` My son , the world was not made in a day -- but in seven . Return on Sunday . ' On the Sunday following I did return to him . Instead of having watered his cabbage with arsenic , he had watered it this time with a solution of salts , having their basis in strychnine , strychnos colubrina , as the learned term it . Now , the cabbage had not the slightest appearance of disease in the world , and the rabbit had not the smallest distrust ; yet , five minutes afterwards , the rabbit was dead . The fowl pecked at the rabbit , and the next day was a dead hen . This time we were the vultures ; so we opened the bird , and this time all special symptoms had disappeared , there were only general symptoms . There was no peculiar indication in any organ -- an excitement of the nervous system -- that was it ; a case of cerebral congestion -- nothing more . The fowl had not been poisoned -- she had died of apoplexy . Apoplexy is a rare disease among fowls , I believe , but very common among men .

After every action requiring exertion , it is conscience that saves us , for it supplies us with a thousand good excuses , of which we alone are judges ; and these reasons , howsoever excellent in producing sleep , would avail us but very little before a tribunal , when we were tried for our lives . Thus Richard III. , for instance , was marvellously served by his conscience after the putting away of the two children of Edward IV. ; in fact , he could say , ` These two children of a cruel and persecuting king , who have inherited the vices of their father , which I alone could perceive in their juvenile propensities -- these two children are impediments in my way of promoting the happiness of the English people , whose unhappiness they -LRB- the children -RRB- would infallibly have caused . ' Thus was Lady Macbeth served by her conscience , when she sought to give her son , and not her husband -LRB- whatever Shakespeare may say -RRB- , a throne . Ah , maternal love is a great virtue , a powerful motive -- so powerful that it excuses a multitude of things , even if , after Duncan 's death , Lady Macbeth had been at all pricked by her conscience .

In the meanwhile , as the thing is difficult to find in France , and your abbé is not probably disposed to make a journey to Paris on my account , I must continue to use Monsieur Planche 's anti- spasmodics ; and mint and Hoffman 's drops are among my favorite remedies .

Finally , he is anxious to see if you have been fortunate enough to escape the bad moral influence to which you have been exposed , and which is infinitely more to be dreaded than any physical suffering ; he wishes to discover if the fine abilities with which nature had endowed you have been weakened by want of culture ; and , in short , whether you consider yourself capable of resuming and retaining in the world the high position to which your rank entitles you .

Now , to follow out this reasoning , what is the marvellous ? -- that which we do not understand . What is it that we really desire ? -- that which we can not obtain . Now , to see things which I can not understand , to procure impossibilities , these are the study of my life . I gratify my wishes by two means -- my will and my money . I take as much interest in the pursuit of some whim as you do , M. Danglars , in promoting a new railway line ; you , M. de Villefort , in condemning a culprit to death ; you , M. Debray , in pacifying a kingdom ; you , M. de Château-Renaud , in pleasing a woman ; and you , Morrel , in breaking a horse that no one can ride .

I take that God to witness , at whose feet I have prostrated myself daily for the last ten years , that I would have sacrificed my life to you , and with my life the projects that were indissolubly linked with it . But -- and I say it with some pride , Mercédès -- God needed me , and I lived . Examine the past and the present , and endeavor to dive into futurity , and then say whether I am not a divine instrument . The most dreadful misfortunes , the most frightful sufferings , the abandonment of all those who loved me , the persecution of those who did not know me , formed the trials of my youth ; when suddenly , from captivity , solitude , misery , I was restored to light and liberty , and became the possessor of a fortune so brilliant , so unbounded , so unheard-of , that I must have been blind not to be conscious that God had endowed me with it to work out his own great designs . From that time I looked upon this fortune as something confided to me for a particular purpose . Not a thought was given to a life which you once , Mercédès , had the power to render blissful ; not one hour of peaceful calm was mine ; but I felt myself driven on like an exterminating angel . Like adventurous captains about to embark on some enterprise full of danger , I laid in my provisions , I loaded my weapons , I collected every means of attack and defence ; I inured my body to the most violent exercises , my soul to the bitterest trials ; I taught my arm to slay , my eyes to behold excruciating sufferings , and my mouth to smile at the most horrid spectacles . Good-natured , confiding , and forgiving as I had been , I became revengeful , cunning , and wicked , or rather , immovable as fate . Then I launched out into the path that was opened to me .

Alas , you , who would have been such a powerful protector to me in the days of your health and strength , can now only sympathize in my joys and sorrows , without being able to take any active part in them .

But , under the present circumstances , I am justified in doubting the wisdom of an old man who , because he hated the father , vents his anger on the son . It would be ridiculous in me to regulate my conduct by such caprices . I shall still continue to preserve the same respect toward M. Noirtier ; I will suffer , without complaint , the pecuniary deprivation to which he has subjected me ; but I shall remain firm in my determination , and the world shall see which party has reason on his side .

When my father conspired , it was not for the emperor , it was against the Bourbons ; for M.

But since then everything has changed in and about me ; I am accustomed to brave difficulties , and , in the conflict to crush those who , by their own free will , or by chance , voluntarily or involuntarily , interfere with me in my career . It is generally the case that what we most ardently desire is as ardently withheld from us by those who wish to obtain it , or from whom we attempt to snatch it . Thus , the greater number of a man 's errors come before him disguised under the specious form of necessity ; then , after error has been committed in a moment of excitement , of delirium , or of fear , we see that we might have avoided and escaped it . The means we might have used , which we in our blindness could not see , then seem simple and easy , and we say , ` Why did I not do this , instead of that ?

Perhaps he will be young , strong , and enduring , like yourself , and will aid you in your escape , while I have been but a hindrance .

The very circumstances which inflict on you , as a principal in the tragic scene enacted here , such painful emotions , are to me , on the contrary , a source of something like contentment , and serve but to enhance the value of this dwelling in my estimation . The chief beauty of trees consists in the deep shadow of their umbrageous boughs , while fancy pictures a moving multitude of shapes and forms flitting and passing beneath that shade . Here I have a garden laid out in such a way as to afford the fullest scope for the imagination , and furnished with thickly grown trees , beneath whose leafy screen a visionary like myself may conjure up phantoms at will . This to me , who expected but to find a blank enclosure surrounded by a straight wall , is , I assure you , a most agreeable surprise . I have no fear of ghosts , and I have never heard it said that so much harm had been done by the dead during six thousand years as is wrought by the living in a single day . Retire within , Bertuccio , and tranquillize your mind . Should your confessor be less indulgent to you in your dying moments than you found the Abbé Busoni , send for me , if I am still on earth , and I will soothe your ears with words that shall effectually calm and soothe your parting soul ere it goes forth to traverse the ocean called eternity .

Then observe , too , that the woman with him is altogether unlike all others of her sex . She is a foreigner -- a stranger . Nobody knows who she is , or where she comes from . No doubt she belongs to the same horrible race he does , and is , like himself , a dealer in magical arts .

Indeed , I feel quite sure , from the cut of his clothes , they are made by a first-rate Paris tailor -- probably Blin or Humann .

Now , by way of having a resting-place during his excursions , avoiding the wretched cookery -- which has been trying its best to poison me during the last four months , while you have manfully resisted its effects for as many years , -- and obtaining a bed on which it is possible to slumber , Monte Cristo has furnished for himself a temporary abode where you first found him ; but , to prevent the possibility of the Tuscan government taking a fancy to his enchanted palace , and thereby depriving him of the advantages naturally expected from so large an outlay of capital , he has wisely enough purchased the island , and taken its name .

'' ","i":216415},{"w":"`` Ah , monsieur , '' ","i":217149},{"w":"`` I would never forgive you this mistake if you had seen another picture beside this . You do not know my mother ; she it is whom you see here . She had her portrait painted thus six or eight years ago . This costume is a fancy one , it appears , and the resemblance is so great that I think I still see my mother the same as she was in 1830 . The countess had this portrait painted during the count 's absence . She doubtless intended giving him an agreeable surprise ; but , strange to say , this portrait seemed to displease my father , and the value of the picture , which is , as you see , one of the best works of Léopold Robert , could not overcome his dislike to it . It is true , between ourselves , that M. de Morcerf is one of the most assiduous peers at the Luxembourg , a general renowned for theory , but a most mediocre amateur of art . It is different with my mother , who paints exceedingly well , and who , unwilling to part with so valuable a picture , gave it to me to put here , where it would be less likely to displease M. de Morcerf , whose portrait , by Gros , I will also show you . Excuse my talking of family matters , but as I shall have the honor of introducing you to the count , I tell you this to prevent you making any allusions to this picture . The picture seems to have a malign influence , for my mother rarely comes here without looking at it , and still more rarely does she look at it without weeping . This disagreement is the only one that has ever taken place between the count and countess , who are still as much united , although married more than twenty years , as on the first day of their wedding . '' ","i":217158},{"w":"`` Now , '' ","i":217535},{"w":"`` that you have seen all my treasures , allow me to offer them to you , unworthy as they are . Consider yourself as in your own house , and to put yourself still more at your ease , pray accompany me to the apartments of M. de Morcerf , he whom I wrote from Rome an account of the services you rendered me , and to whom I announced your promised visit , and I may say that both the count and countess anxiously desire to thank you in person . You are somewhat blasé I know , and family scenes have not much effect on Sinbad the Sailor , who has seen so many others . However , accept what I propose to you as an initiation into Parisian life -- a life of politeness , visiting , and introductions .

'' ","i":218127},{"w":"`` you are more fortunate than the government , for your arms are really beautiful , and speak to the imagination .

I could , therefore , expect a higher rank , and who knows what might have happened had the elder branch remained on the throne ? But the Revolution of July was , it seems , sufficiently glorious to allow itself to be ungrateful , and it was so for all services that did not date from the imperial period . I tendered my resignation , for when you have gained your epaulets on the battle-field , you do not know how to manœuvre on the slippery grounds of the salons . I have hung up my sword , and cast myself into politics . I have devoted myself to industry ; I study the useful arts . During the twenty years I served , I often wished to do so , but I had not the time .
